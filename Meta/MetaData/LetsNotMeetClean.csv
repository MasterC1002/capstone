1362884379.0	1a06qx	My mum used to clean houses. She quit after this.	WalterDisneey	2018	231	89	"In the mid-80s, my mum was a cleaner in Australia. She would do clean houses in suburban areas and would sometimes do houses in rural/wine regions (we lived near both).

She would leave business cards at the local shops and got most of her business this way, and some through referrals and word of mouth. 

One day she got a call from a lady who sounded like she was around 60, asking mum to clean her old farmhouse. She made a lot of odd demands and mum would usually meet clients before taking on new business. In this case, the lady did not want to meet mum and said she would leave the keys under the front doormat. Mum agreed mainly because the lady was quite obviously wealthy and was offering to pay mum substantially more than she would reasonably expect. 

Mum went to the house on a Monday morning and said she already felt unnerved by the long driveway. The house was essentially in the middle of a very large, and very empty property. She found the keys and started cleaning. 

About an hour in to the clean, she hears the back door shut. Mum was told no one would be at the house so she immediately felt unsafe. She stood frozen in the kitchen for what she said felt like 3-4 minutes although she said it could have been much longer. There was no other car on the property. 

She wanted to leave immediately but had two rooms left to do, both were bedrooms. She said as time passed and she heard nothing else, she decided that perhaps it was nothing, or perhaps something had fallen and it wasn't the door after all. 

She walked up the hallway and stepped into the bedroom. All over the bed were black and white photos. As mum got closer, she realised the photos were all of her. Some where taken at our family home, and many others were taken at other houses mum would clean. Some through windows or over fences. 

She used the house phone to call the police and immediately drive to the end of the driveway. The lady ended up being investigated but continued to claim that it was a break-in. After some time, the police stopped with their searching and we ended up moving to a new town 4 months later. 

Every time mum tells me this story I get serious chills. Absolutely a true story too. To the day my mum thinks the lady had something to do with it. But why? And for what purpose?

Any theories?"	t5_2t3t8	True
1376340681.0	1k8c54	The weirdo at McDonald's. (AKA The day I lost some of my innocence)	Lectra	2819	1049	770	"When I was growing up, my dad and I lived with my grandparents.  My parents had me while they were teenagers and my dad got full custody because he lived with my grandparents and my mom was just living with random friends, going from house to house every few weeks.  I was the daughter my grandparents never had, and they doted on me.  When I was 6, my grandpa passed away from cancer.  This story takes place about 5 months after he passed away.

This was I believe a Saturday and my dad was at work.  My Gram decided to take me to McDonald's for lunch and, like any 6 year old, I was really excited.  So we go to the McDonald's that was about a mile and a half from our house, order our lunch, and sit down at a table to eat.  At the time we were the only ones eating inside.

About 10 minutes after we sit down, a scraggly looking man walks in, orders a meal, and sits down at the table diagonally in front of us to the left.  The area we lived in was middle and upper middle class, so this guy looked pretty out of place.  Gram had her back to him but I could see him perfectly.  This man was at least in his mid 50's, with really wirey/scraggy and dirty white hair and beard.  He had on blue shorts and a white T-Shirt, also kinda dirty, and sandals.  It's amazing, this happened 21 years ago and I can remember it like it was yesterday.

So, I notice that, under the table, this man had something dark pink and wrinkly on his lap, and he kept glancing at me and rubbing it every few seconds.  In kindergarten, we learned about stranger danger and ""good touch, bad touch"" and learned which parts of our body people weren't supposed to touch.  It clicked, in my 6 year old head, that this man was *not* supposed to have that out like that, nor doing what he was doing.

I got really queasy and nervous.  I didn't want to tell my Gram right then and there because I thought the man would hurt us (if my dad had been there I would've said something because my dad was my hero and could take on anybody).  Instead, I put my Happy Meal box in front of my face so my view of this guy would be blocked.  I had about half of my food left but had lost my appetite.  Gram asked me if I was full and I just nodded yes.  I was (and still am) very petite, so not finishing a full meal was nothing new for me.  She asked me if I wanted to go play in the play area before we left, but I just shook my head and quietly said ""I wanna go home.""  Gram cleared our table and we left.

When we got home, I was still really nervous and I felt like I was going to throw up.  Gram asked me ""What's the matter munchkin?"" (her pet name for me) and I started crying and told her about the man at the McDonald's and what I saw.  My Gram didn't panic or freak or get hysterical, she just hugged me and said ""It's alright, go on to your room and play and I'll take care of it.""  She wiped my tears, gave me a blueberry Kool-Aid Burst, and told our dog, Patches, to go to my room with me, which she did.

After I was out of earshot, Gram called the McDonald's and told them about the guy.  He was still there!  The manager told Gram he'd take care of it and call her back.  An hour later, the manager calls back and tells Gram they called the police, who showed up in record time, and arrested the guy.  When the police told the man to stand up, his frank and beans were still hanging out of his shorts.  The manager also told Gram that she could bring me back for a months worth of coupons for free Happy Meals.

I have another story about a weirdo that happened a few years later and this time my dad *was* there and believe me, what my dad did to him was not pretty. But that's a story for another time.

Edit: Changed the name of the drink my Gram gave me, as I was mistaken about the name."	t5_2t3t8	True
1362462907.0	19oxoc	Dr. Ramsey	sweetmercy	1846	223	333	"I recently replied to a post on Askreddit about scariest experiences, and after reading what I had to say a couple of people suggested I post about it here, so here I am. :)

A week or so before my 10th birthday, I walked to the corner store with a $5 bill and picked up a jar of Ragu for my mom. On my way home, a man I'd never seen before fell in step with me and began talking. 

""Hi!"" he said, cheerfully. ""My name is Dr. Ramsey. I'm a pediatrician. Do you know what a pediatrician is?""

I walked along silently, not replying and fervently hoping he would take that as a sign he should leave me alone. Subtleties were not his strong suit, though, because he kept right on chattering. 

""Are your parents looking for a pediatrician for you? Of course, you're almost a big girl now, you'll be needing another kind of doctor soon, won't you? That's okay though. They can still bring you to me until then. What's your name? You have beautiful hair. I was just on my way to get some suckers for the candy jar in my office. Do you like suckers?""

Thankfully, we were nearing my house, so I ran forward, up the back steps and into through the kitchen door. I didn't know it then, but that was the beginning of a very long, very scary ordeal. It didn't take long after that for ""Dr. Ramsey"" to begin showing up. At first, it seemed benign enough...at least to a kid. He would drive by nearly every day, smiling and waving. I told my mom, who said maybe it was on his way home from work. But then, the phone calls began. 

My dad called me into the living room, and sat me down. He asked about the day Dr. Ramsey followed me home, and if I talked to him. He said I wasn't in trouble, but that I needed to tell him the truth. I told him know, and he asked if I was sure...could I be forgetting something? I told him know again, and he frowned, then asked ""Then how does he know your name?"" I didn't know. 

It turns out, that was not all he knew. He knew my sister's name as well. Pretty soon, neither my sister or I were allowed to answer the phone. He called several times a day; at first, neither of us knew what he was saying. Then, one night, one of my brothers told us that he was telling my parents that he was going to hurt me (and later, my sister). 

Things got complicated after that. My dad had called the police, but as this was before there were any stalking laws, there was not a lot they could do. They told my parents to call back if he ""tried anything"". My dad then called a friend of his from back in the day, who happened to be a cop. For the next month, my dad's friend escorted me to and from school. Suddenly, life as I knew it came screeching to a halt. I couldn't walk to school alone, I couldn't play outside, I couldn't walk to SuperAmerica (sort of like a 7-11 for those who don't know). 

When access to me was completely denied, things escalated. It was around this time he began threatening my sister as well. Then one afternoon my sister, two of my brothers, my mom and I were in the kitchen. One of my brothers saw a glimpse of someone in the garage; they'd seen him too. Dr. Ramsey came bolting out of the garage, my brothers chasing after him. They ran all the way to Cherokee Park, where he lost them in the trees. My parents called the police again, but nothing came of it. The only information they had was a description and a name that was almost certainly fake. 

A couple weeks later, we woke to find our dog hanging from the side porch. She was a gorgeous saddle-back German shepherd, born the same day I was. We were all devastated. The cops said there was no evidence it was him, and ruled it accidental, but none of us believed that. 

His phone calls became more informative in the meantime. He would talk about who was home, and who wasn't. If my brother would say my dad was home, he would tell him who was really in the house. He also would talk about the house itself...about the window in the kitchen he could easily open with a knife from the outside even when it was locked, and about the french doors that connected the living room to the side porch and how the lock could be finagled from the outside if you jiggled it just right. That night, my dad put in some carpenter nails at the bottom of the french doors until he could get a new lock ordered.

My parents had to go to a company event for my dad's work. My older brothers were at Saints West roller skating rink. My sister was on the phone with her best friend. My little brother was on the floor asleep. I was watching Devo on the Midnight Special with Wolfman Jack. It was late. Suddenly, the top of the french doors swung inward, and in the few miliseconds before the nails in the bottom caused them to snap back, I could see his silhouette. My sister whipped the phone at the television, and we ran up the stairs. About halfway up, we realized our little brother was still asleep on the living room floor. As quietly as we could, we slipped back down the stairs to get him. We all went into our bedroom and didn't turn on the light; this way we could see outside. We watched out the window for a while, and when we didn't find him, we crept down the hall to our brothers' room to look. We looked down and could see someone standing at the backdoor. He knocked, loudly. 

""What do you want?"" my sister asked out the window. He stepped back and said ""Is this the Mercy residence? I have a pizza for delivery. Can you come to the door?"" 
She scoffed at him, declaring she was not stupid, she could see he didn't have a pizza, and she was calling the cops. He left. 

A short while later, my brothers returned home. We told them what happened and they walked around the yard, watching for him. They came back in, and things settled down. By now we'd pretty much given up calling the cops because it never helped, so we just went back in, each of us (except my youngest brother, still asleep) carrying a knife from the kitchen ""just in case"". Eventually, one of my brothers went into the kitchen to get a bowl of cereal as a snack. 

You know that sensation you get when you can just *feel* someone watching you? Yeah, he had that in spades. He kept looking around the kitchen, through the doorway into the dining room, at the windows. He didn't see anything, but he could still feel eyes on him, so he went closer to the door to try to see better. The kitchen lights were reflecting on the windows of the door (it had 3 rows of 3 windows), so he still couldn't see. He stepped closer, then closer again, until he was right up to the door, then cupped his hands on either side of his head so he could see. There on the other side of the window pane was Dr. Ramsey, smiling back at him. He turned to yell for my older brothers, and when he looked back again, he was gone. They went out again to look for him, but didn't see him. 

The next night we were at the table playing crazy 8's, and my brother was restless. My sister asked him what's wrong, and he said he always felt like any minute now there would be a 'boom boom boom!' on a door or window. Almost immediately after he finished his sentence, ""BOOM BOOM BOOM!"" on the window right behind him. In the chaos, the two eldest ran out, but he was already gone. 

A couple of weeks later, I was at school and we were outside on the playground during recess. I was swinging upside down when I saw that now-familiar blue Ford Galaxy cruising by, moving slowly. There he was, smiling and waving. He called my name, and I ran to the teacher and told her. The school had been told all about him, and she took me inside right away and called my mom. That same day my mom had gotten a call from the school office asking her to verify that my dad was picking me up, as he'd called to say he was on his way. He wasn't. 

Not long after that, I woke up one night, thirsty. I went down to the kitchen for a drink and there, sitting alone in the dark, was my dad. On the table, a gun. He was tired of the the police waiting until Dr. Ramsey ""tried something"", he was tired of his children being terrorized, he was tired of being afraid every time he left for work that something would happen to us while he was gone. I sat with him for a time, watching, before he sent me back to bed. 

These events, and many more, took place over a period of around 18 months. Then, as suddenly as it began, it was over. He had vanished from our lives; the phone calls, the drive-by with the creepy waves, everything. For a long time, during and after the Dr. Ramsey days, I would have a recurring nightmare in which I would wake up to find him standing over me as I slept. It took a long time before I felt like a kid again. 

I found out years later that when he was calling, Dr. Ramsey would tell my parents that he was going to rape and kill me, and later my sister...and that there was nothing they could do about it. I don't know what happened to him when he disappeared. I don't know if he was in a car wreck, locked in prison, in a coma...but sometimes I wonder if the wait ended for my dad when he was sitting in the darkened kitchen one night. I don't know, and I'm not sure I want to."	t5_2t3t8	True
1370417148.0	1fpiwk	*I* was the creeper.	GSilvermane	1509	187	52	"I am a 28 year old male living in the deep South. I am (now) a functional, medicated and therapy-attending paranoid schizophrenic. However, I wasn't always this way, and this story comes from a time before I ever even knew what was wrong. 

It was about April 2007 when this happened. I had just come out of a painful divorce, and she had taken all of my friends away from me in the process. I was, obviously, trying to reach out to anyone I could, but I had severe codependency issues that I didn't know how to address. Anyway, I found myself wandering the games section of my local Wal-Mart, as I am still a gamer at heart, and had to see what was available. Things were going all right, and I seemed to be in control of myself.

Then he appeared. 

This poor, unsuspecting soul started talking to me about World of Warcraft, which I happened to play. I perked up at this point, thinking I could make a friend, a new friend that hadn't been taken from me. We made casual jokes and talked about the new expansion (I can't remember if it had just came out, or if it was soon to come). At this point, his mother (he was probably about 18-20, judging by his appearance) came by and took him to another aisle. He didn't say goodbye, he just walked off, and like that, our conversation was through.

Well, in my mind, we had made a connection. We had bonded. In my sick, twisted state, I thought he would appreciate it if we hung out for a while. 

So I followed him. 

I made a point to casually stroll down the aisles that he happened to visit, and strike up conversations with him about different things, jokes, I can't remember. I could tell he was getting creeped out by the third time I had done this. He started getting this deer in headlights look every time he saw me, and it was starting to become a horror story, though in my eyes, it was perfectly natural. 

At some point, however, his Fight-Or-Flight must have kicked in, because when I appeared, as soon as I opened my mouth to speak, he screamed ""LEAVE ME ALONE!"" and stormed off, dragging his mother as quickly as he possibly could. 

This was a wake-up call for me, that I was being severely creepy, and also a stalker. I realized that this could very well be the behavior that caused my divorce in the first place. 

I checked myself into a mental institution soon after, and got the help I needed. I am now significantly better, and my relationships with people have improved greatly. I now have good friends, and a loving fiancee. 

Not all creepers mean to be creepy. Some of us just need the proper psychiatric help. On behalf of all the unknowing and good-intentioned creepers out there, I humbly and sincerely apologize for our behavior. It doesn't make it forgivable, but I hope it does give some context as to what goes on in the mind of a creeper. 

Thank you for your time. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1333695602.0	rvzaq	The Smiling Man	blue_tidal	1366	144	170	"About five years ago I lived downtown in a major city in the US. I've always been a night person, so I would often find myself bored after my roommate, who was decidedly not a night person, went to sleep. To pass the time, I used to go for long walks and spend the time thinking.

I spent four years like that, walking alone at night, and never once had a reason to feel afraid. I always used to joke with my roommate that even the drug dealers in the city were polite. But all of that changed in just a few minutes of one evening.

It was a Wednesday, somewhere between one and two in the morning, and I was walking near a police patrolled park quite a ways from my apartment. It was a quiet night, even for a week night, with very little traffic and almost no one on foot.  The park, as it was most nights, was completely empty.

I turned down a short side street in order to loop back to my apartment when I first noticed him. At the far end of the street, on my side, was the silhouette of a man, dancing. It was a strange dance, similar to a waltz, but he finished each ""box"" with an odd forward stride. I guess you could say he was dance-walking, headed straight for me.

Deciding he was probably drunk, I stepped as close as I could to the road to give him the majority of the sidewalk to pass me by. The closer he got, the more I realized how gracefully he was moving. He was very tall and lanky, and wearing an old suit. He danced closer still, until I could make out his face. His eyes were open wide and wild, head tilted back slightly, looking off at the sky. His mouth was formed in a painfully wide cartoon of a smile. Between the eyes and the smile, I decided to cross the street before he danced any closer.

I took my eyes off of him to cross the empty street. As I reached the other side, I glanced back... and then stopped dead in my tracks. He had stopped dancing and was standing with one foot in the street, perfectly parallel to me. He was facing me but still looking skyward. Smile still wide on his lips.

I was completely and utterly unnerved by this. I started walking again, but kept my eyes on the man. He didn't move.

Once I had put about half a block between us, I turned away from him for a moment to watch the sidewalk in front of me. The street and sidewalk ahead of me were completely empty. Still unnerved, I looked back to where he had been standing to find him gone. For the briefest of moments I felt relieved, until I noticed him. He had crossed the street, and was now slightly crouched down. I couldn't tell for sure due to the distance and the shadows, but I was certain he was facing me. I had looked away from him for no more than 10 seconds, so it was clear that he had moved fast.

I was so shocked that I stood there for some time, staring at him. And then he started moving toward me again. He took giant, exaggerated tip toed steps, as if he were a cartoon character sneaking up on someone. Except he was moving very, very quickly.

I'd like to say at this point I ran away or pulled out my pepper spray or my cellphone or anything at all, but I didn't. I just stood there, completely frozen as the smiling man crept toward me.

And then he stopped again, about a car length away from me. Still smiling his smile, still looking to the sky.

When I finally found my voice, I blurted out the first thing that came to mind. What I meant to ask was, ""What the fuck do you want?!"" in an angry, commanding tone. What came out was a whimper, ""What the fuu…?""

Regardless of whether or not humans can smell fear, they can certainly hear it. I heard it in my own voice, and that only made me more afraid. But he didn't react to it at all. He just stood there, smiling.

And then, after what felt like forever, he turned around, very slowly, and started dance-walking away. Just like that. Not wanting to turn my back to him again, I just watched him go, until he was far enough away to almost be out of sight. And then I realized something. He wasn't moving away anymore, nor was he dancing. I watched in horror as the distant shape of him grew larger and larger. He was coming back my way. And this time he was running.

I ran too.

I ran until I was off of the side road and back onto a better lit road with sparse traffic. Looking behind me then, he was nowhere to be found. The rest of the way home, I kept glancing over my shoulder, always expecting to see his stupid smile, but he was never there.

I lived in that city for six months after that night, and I never went out for another walk. There was something about his face that always haunted me. He didn't look drunk, he didn't look high. He looked completely and utterly insane. And that's a very, very scary thing to see."	t5_2t3t8	True
1373425821.0	1hze34	My sister claimed someone comes into her house in the middle of the night.	NemoNobody2092	1345	184	143	"Okay, so this whole thing began maybe 2 months ago. 
At an Aunts party my sister comes up to me and says that she thinks someone has been coming into her house in the middle of the night. 
My sister has always been easily scared, so at first i was skeptical.

I asked her how she knew someone had been in the house, whether she had actually seen anyone etc. 
She told me she hadn't seen anyone, but she said she knows for a fact someone was in her house. 
She then went on to explain that she has a sky box downstairs that streams to her bedroom television, the first time it happened she said she heard the TV was being used, so she turned on her TV and someone was flicking through the channels.

I still didn't really buy what she was saying, but she did seem genuinely afraid. She claimed it had been going on for three months on and off. To put her mind at ease, i told her I'd stay at her place for a few nights and wait to see if the guy comes, i took my younger brother along just to be safe.

In all, we stayed at her place for 4 nights. In those four nights, nothing unusual happened, me and my brother were convinced she was going crazy. Me and my brother decided we had stayed long enough and told her that we had to go home, she got extremely upset about this. 

I reassured her and told her to call the police the next time it happened, she had called the police once before about the guy and they turned up to find no one was in the house. I said she could call me anytime she wanted and left for work.

Two days later she called me at 11:30PM, and claimed he was downstairs in her house right now. I asked her how she knew and she said he's walking around the house, she was whispering and crying. I knew she wasn't making this up, i could tell from her voice.
I called my brother and told him to meet me at her house, i was on the phone with her the entire drive over to her place (i live 10 minutes away).

When i got there my brother was parked up outside, we both went to the back of the house (I was still on the phone with my sister). Downstairs was lit solely by the TV in the living room, as we approached the patio door we saw that a man was sitting on the couch facing us. We were frozen solid, my sister noticed that we went quiet and started asking what was wrong and if we could see him.

I told her to stay quiet and that we had it in hand, i then hung up and called the police to explain the situation. The guy hadn't moved from the couch at all. The TV turned off while we were waiting for the cops, me and my brother majorly freaked out when it happened.
We couldn't see anything downstairs, then the hallway light turned on, meaning someone was on the stairs.

We opened the patio door and ran up the stairs and caught the guy with his ear to her door. We kicked the shit out of him and got my sister out of the house, he had a knife in his coat pocket. 

The cops came maybe 10 minutes later (he could have killed her if he wanted too.) which is fucking outrageous. It turns out the guy was one of our moms old boyfriends who had lived with us for a while in the 90's. He had always been fond of my sister but we had never suspected it to be him, he hadn't contacted any of us for nearly a decade. 

My sister has moved back in with my mom and is undergoing therapy to get over what had happened. Our 'step dad' as he liked to call himself, was given three years in prison, we are doing are best to cut all ties with the man.

1361483305.0	18za14	"My female ""friend"" turned into a stalker and creeper"	babyhugbears	1294	164	90	"This is a tale about a friend I used to have years ago. Her name was Sara and I met her in the 7th grade. Back then, she was a normal preteen girl, much like myself. We were best of friends for 7th and 8th grade. We lost touch after our 8th grade graduation because we went to separate high schools: public for her, private school for me. 

It wasn't until I moved back into my mother's house at the age of 19, pregnant and depressed from my failed relationship with both my father and ex, that I started talking to her again. We picked right back up where we left off at the end of 8th grade and quickly rebuilt our friendship back to best friend status. She even agreed to be my son's godmother. 

Now, I want to take a moment and tell you a bit about Sara and myself. We were the same age, our birthdays roughly two weeks apart from each other. She was the oldest of three girls. We both appeared to look similar almost. Both fairly pale in skin, glasses, and same height (she was a few inches taller than me, but nothing to really brag about) and weight. Her hair color was more blonde compared to my brunetteness and had blue eyes while I have brown eyes. Back to the story. 

This takes place a few months after I had given birth. Nothing major had happened between me and her yet, expect she was a little bossy, but I brushed that off as being the eldest sibling. Nothing I couldn't handle. The only thing that I found weird was that she freaked out if I didn't answer her text messages back right away. Even if I was at work and couldn't without fear of losing my job. But I tried brushing it off as her worrying about me. 

I had started dating a new guy named Josh. Sara was actually the one that introduced us two because Josh was a good friend with her boyfriend, Rob. Naturally, I started spending a little more time with Josh, but still spent a lot of my time with Sara. She didn't take to this very well, and tried causing problems for me and Josh. After having a sit down with Sara, telling her I wasn't giving up our friendship but neither was I going to push a guy I really liked away. She seemed to have gotten the message and backed off. 

Shit hit the fan shortly after Josh and I moved into an apartment together. Sara demanded to spend more time with me while Josh was at work. I really had no problem with it, but her bossiness started to reach unbearable levels. She didn't ask to stay for dinner, simply said she was staying. Asking her to leave for the night fell upon deaf ears and many times crashed on our sofa (causing any possible sexy times with Josh to fade.) It got to the point she started tagging along on our dates, so we simply started not going out. I tried talking to her, but she kept saying if I was a real friend, I wouldn't mind her being there all the time. 

Well, we managed to get one free weekend without Sara. She had gone to some water park with her family, so Josh and I got to spend some much needed alone time together. However, because of the strain Sara caused us, we had a hard time enjoying each other. I refused to end my relationship with him and we tried hard to work it out. We tried talking to her boyfriend, Rob, asking if he could help us. He said they were planning on getting an apartment together at the beginning of the following month (she was still living with her parents at this point), but told us it was looking like it was going to be in the same complex as us. I could deal with that, figured she would want to spend time in her new place, decorating it and hosting dinners for her friends and families. 

Also note, I had gotten my hair done earlier in the week. I got an awesome new haircut that looked great and loved it a lot. I got many compliments on it from various friends. Well, when Sara came back from her mini vacation, she had dyed her hair to the same color as mine and gotten it cut the exact same way. I didn't really mind too much, it was a pretty sweet haircut, but both Josh and I couldn't get over how weird it was we were looking like twins. She even got colored contacts to wear under her glasses that changed her eyes to the color of brown. Like me. 

One night later that week, I was hanging out with another mutual friend of ours without Sara. Her name was Heather. Heather and I had gotten around to talking about Sara when Heather said, casually, ""You know she is jealous of your life right? She's even got a huge crush on Josh and *you*."" I really had no idea. She didn't say anything about it to me, and I had no idea she harbored feelings like that for me. She's had many different boyfriends over the years. 

After that, I started to notice a shift in Sara. She wanted to spend even more time alone with me, and oddly enough, more alone time with just Josh. On one of these nights, she tried to kiss me. Now, I have no problem with someone being gay. I have many other friends who are, but I am not, and everyone knows it. I like guys way to much. I told her this and she went crazy. Told me I was a lying cunt, that I was leading her on, and that I *had to kiss her back* because she said so. I told her no, I didn't, and I didn't lead her on. She left shortly after to meet up with Rob and Josh while I took care of my son. I didn't really think anything of it until Rob came over, saying Sara kicked him out of the house because she wanted to talk to Josh alone. 

I filled Rob in on what had happened, what Heather said, and my feelings. He sensed something weird was going on. I got Heather to come over to watch my son while Rob and I went back to their apartment to confront her. We found her in bed with Josh. Naturally both Rob and I were upset. Rob and I just left and he crashed on my sofa for the night, though I don't think either of us really did much sleeping. 

The next day, I broke up with Josh and Rob broke up with Sara. Rob ended up moving back in with his father and just cut ties with Sara and Josh completely. Sara blamed me for the ending of her relationship with Rob and vowed to make my life a living hell. She kept her apartment in the same complex as mine and tried very hard to get me in trouble with our landlord. At random times, the landlord would stop by saying I had a noise complaint against me or said that someone complained about some awful smell coming from my place. After the third time he came by saying someone saw a rat coming out of my door did he realize someone was just trying to cause me trouble. (I had told him, but he has a job to do I guess.) 

When Sara learned that wasn't working, she started calling my home phone and cellphone at random times. Never said anything, and all the calls were Restricted, but I knew it was her. From my window I could see into her apartment and always saw her looking out at my window while on the phone. On the phone the exact times my phones were ringing. I quickly changed my phone numbers and that was the end of that day. No one besides my mom and work had them and neither cared for Sara much after learning what she had done. 

When she realized she couldn't get a hold of me via phone, she took to blowing up my email and Myspace/Facebook. Obviously it didn't take me long to block her on that. 

However, this takes the cake. Apparently she had a copy of my key. I don't know how she got it, I never gave her a copy. I figured Josh might have given her one when they started to be sexually active or else she just stole Josh's and made her own copy. She took to entering my house when I wasn't home. At first I started noticing little things disappearing or being moved. My bills were no longer on the kitchen counter, but on the dining table. My favorite shirt had gone missing. Cordless phone across the room from where I last remember setting it down. I thought I was simply losing it and misplacing things. (I am a bit scattered brain, but not that much.) This went on for two or three weeks until bigger things were missing. My son's DVD player, my keyboard, cellphone charger, bath soap, towels, and even my son's baby blanket were all taken. 

Naturally, I did the most logical thing and called the police and landlord. Landlord changed out my locks ASAP and the cops agreed to talk to Sara. They said they wouldn't be able to do anything unless she let them in and/or admitted it, but they would still try to talk to her. And this is what I was told:

They knocked on the door. She opened it wide enough for them to see the wall behind her. On this wall was hundreds of photos of me, either alone at work or at the store or with my son at the park, store, etc. It wouldn't have been so creepy if it weren't for the fact that she wrote in big letters with red paint ""Die [my name] you fucking cunt."" It covered some of the photos and the wall. 

The police were able to search her place. They found journals full of her writing saying how she wanted to kill me, how she was going to do it, and other fucked up things. She had my work schedule written on her calender (not that it was hard to guess it, it was the same every week) and on a certain day she had it circled and marked as ""Kill Day."" Police found an unregistered gun and a huge knife. She was arrested. 

I promptly moved out and back into my mother's house. I found a new job and changed my appearance. I cut off contact with all our mutual friends (not tha twe had many) and found a new job. I haven't seen or heard from her in 3 years now. For all I know, she is still in jail. I just count my lucky stars. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1370937145.0	1g3x4f	No Good Deed Goes Unpunished	scrambled_debutante	1271	164	92	"I’ve been reading through /r/LetsNotMeet and decided to share one of my own stories.  This happened in the fall of 1993, when I was 20 years old.  In the interest of context, this was before I started college, and I was working in the material prep department of a plastics factory on the night shift.  I was the only woman in the department, and my male coworkers were initially skeptical that I could handle the job, but I proved myself and earned their respect.  It was hard work, but on the plus side, it also put me in the best shape of my life.  It was also about this same time that I’d dumped my abusive boyfriend; he was verbally, emotionally, and physically abusive, as well as an alcoholic.  This fact, more than anything, is probably why I got myself into this situation in the first place. 


I had just gotten off work, and it was about 1:30am.  My car was running on fumes, so I stopped at a local gas station to fill up.  While I was pumping gas, a woman about my age approached me looking nervous and scared.  She said that she had been at her boyfriend’s house, and they’d had a fight.  She’d walked to the gas station to use the pay phone and call a friend to pick her up.  On her way to the station, a car pulled up as she was walking and the guys inside started catcalling and harassing her.  With a slight movement of her head she indicated a car that was parked off to the side by the gas station dumpsters.  I saw a large light green car, like a Caddy or a Lincoln, with at least 2 or 3 shadowy figures inside.  She said they threatened her, and she was too scared to call her friend and wait.  


The woman was neat, well-dressed, and didn’t seem high or drunk or anything like that…she just seemed really nervous and freaked out, so I didn’t even hesitate.  I finished pumping my gas and told her to hop in the car, that I’d take her home.  


At that time on a weeknight, there was little traffic, so I booked it right out of the gas station and asked her where she lived.  She kept twisting around in the seat to see if the car was behind us, and when I asked her to put her seat-belt on, she ignored me and kept looking for the car.  I assumed she was just scared.


A few blocks down the road, however, I noticed she was looking around the car, and she started asking me about money, “Where’s your purse?  Where’s your bag?  I need money.  You need to give me some money.” My stomach sank.  I have this woman in my car, and now she’s gonna rob me.  Fuck.  But when I thought about it, robbery just didn’t make much sense.  I was driving a 1985 Chevette (affectionately nicknamed “Shitbox”) and was wearing my work clothes: a ratty T-shirt and jeans with combat boots.  I did NOT look like a person with a lot of cash primarily because I wasn’t a person with a lot of cash.  


She’d twisted around in the seat again and started yelling, “There they are! There they are!”  She didn’t sound scared anymore.  I checked the rearview, and sure enough, the light green car is right behind me.  She started cackling and bouncing up and down in the seat, “My boys are gonna FUCK YOU UP, bitch!  They’re gonna FUCK YOU UP!” She’s laughing like crazy, opening the glove box, looking in the back for a bag or purse, telling me all the messed up shit these guys are planning to do to me.


Now, if I had been smart, I would have just driven to the police station. Actually, if I had been VERY smart, I would have called the cops from the gas station and waited with her until they arrived. That would have been the intelligent thing to do.  Unfortunately, none of this crossed my mind until later.   In the moment, I just got really, really fucking angry.  I realized 3 key things all at once:


*	 There was an intersection up ahead, with cars on either side waiting to cross, and the light had just turned yellow.
*	I had a spare box cutter that I kept for work in the driver’s side door compartment.
*	The crazy bitch still hadn’t put on her seat-belt.


I didn’t think.   I floored it and passed under the yellow light just as it turned red.  I glanced back to see if the green car was still behind me, but the cross traffic at the intersection had started to move, and they hadn’t caught up.  The bitch started yelling; I slammed on the brakes and she hit the dash and windshield with a solid, and viciously satisfying, crack.  When she rebounded to the passenger seat, I had the box cutter in her face and was screaming some serious bat-shit crazy.   I can’t remember exactly what I said, but it was along the lines of, “Get the FUCK OUT. Get the FUCK out of my car before I CUT OFF YOUR FACE AND MAKE YOU EAT IT, BITCH.”  


The crazy screaming and box-cutter combo worked.  She grabbed blindly at the handle and popped the door open, and I started shoving and punching her until the bitch tumbled out the door to the curb.  I stomped on the gas, got to the next turn and squealed around it with the passenger door still open.  I made a few more turns because I was afraid that the green car might catch up to me.  After a little while I stopped to close the passenger door, and then I cut across town and got on to the highway to go home.  I was on the highway for about 5 minutes before the shakes started.  I pulled off to the shoulder to calm down and get my shit together, and then I drove home.


I told my older sister (I was living with her temporarily after the break-up with my ex) everything that happened.  She wrapped me in a tight bear hug while simultaneously yelling about how stupid I was for not going to the police.  I’ve never been so glad to be yelled at in my life.


**Tl;dr - Woman plays “scared/harassed” card to lure OP into ambush.  OP chooses bat-shit crazy over intelligence.  It went okay.**

It's getting pretty ridiculous, and ruining what this sub used to be. I understand that it was a creepy encounter, and probably very traumatic - as an abuse victim myself, *I get this*. But you know what? There are whooooole subreddits devoted to that kind of story, where you can get the constructive feedback you need to get past the experience. Give /r/rapecounseling and /r/ptsd a try. 

Now I'd like to cite rule 1B) here:

**1B) Stories must be on topic. Stories straying from the focused content of this reddit will be removed.**

While, yes, the general intended theme of LNM is stalking and strange encounters, I think that we have strayed quite a distance from that last one - *strange encounters*. The sad fact is, sexual abuse is not at all uncommon. It happens to many of us: women and men. But you know what? When I come here, it's prime material like a guy getting phonecalls about his ""beautyhole"" that creep me out to the core. Frankly, hearing about someone's pervert uncle does nothing to scare; it makes me want to flip through the other threads to find a decent story, because it just disgusts. And that is all that the threat of sexual violence should *ever* do: disgust us. Not scare us. If we let it frighten us, those who inflict it will win. 

So, yeah. Anyone else here sick and tired of all the nearly-diddled stories? No? Okay. I'll go self-immolate now. Thank you for your time."	t5_2t3t8	True
1370030171.0	1ff9ea	I'm her uncle!	Poppyf	1113	177	85	"This was when I was maybe 14/15 (I'm 17 now) and I am female. Just so you know, I was probably around 5'3 and 100lbs at the time.

So yeah, I was with two of my friends (one male one female) at a large kids playground behind a supermarket. We were right at the top of one of these huge jungle gym rope things, like [this](http://i.imgur.com/Q2yUtfj.jpg) but maybe 2 or 3 times the size. The one I was on had little platform things and we were chilling on one of them eating icecream and people watching. It was a fairly hot day, not like Indian summer but enough so people were in sundresses and shorts and the like. My friends are engaged in conversation and I'm sort of scanning around just watching and judging people. Right at the edge of the park there's a bench, and on it I see some guy sitting there.

 I don't know exactly why but I just got some dodgy feeling from him. He didn't fit it... It was a hot day and he was there all in black, like cargo trousers and bomber jacket type thing. He had sort of olive skin, like maybe from Saudi Arabia that kind of color. I notice he's staring really intently at something, so I follow his gaze to a small child sitting alone on the floor of the park, just running her hands through the sand and shit like that. The park is busy but she's alone, no one is close enough to be a friend or family if that makes sense. She's maybe 1 and a half, possibly 2 years old, ginger hair, pretty as a picture, I mean this kid looks like a freakin' stock photo. 

So back to this guy. He was just staring, watching her really creepily, and I'm like trying to rationalise it in my head. I am well aware that a child's skin color does not always match their parents, but I'm pretty sure this isn't her dad. This girl is white as snow, almost albino like, not even a hint of mixed race in her. Maybe he's a babysitter, family friend, adoptive parent, I don't know. But something about him massively gives me the creeps. He's switching between staring at this kid and tapping away on his mobile, and occasionally holding his phone up as if he's taking photos of the girl.

 Suddenly this little girl bursts into tears, for an unknown reason. Where I'm from its very common if a small child is crying for a passing female (NEVER male) to pick up and comfort the kid, so i go climbing down this rope thing and start walking over to the girl. As I do, the man gets up and sort of power walks over to her, swoops down and picks her up. Hmm, bit weird. I start talking to this guy, just to check everything's as it should be. 

This is the conversation:

Me: aw, she's cute. Is she your daughter?

Him: um.. No.

M: oh right.. You babysitting or something?

H: no.. I'm, uhh.. Her uncle. Yeah.

(Does it take that long to remember how you know this kid? Alarm bells ringing now, I'm gonna test him)

M: ah okay. What's her name?

*pause* 

H:... Lucy.

M: (to the kid) well hey sweetie! My names Poppy. What's yours?

Okay I never studied Child Talk, but I heard something along the lines of Eva. Whatever it was it wasn't even fucking close to Lucy. So something in my head is screaming get the kid. 

As I'm talking to the girl this guy is sort of looking around, not like 'oh it's a beautiful day look at the scenery' more like the look you do when you forgot where you parked your car, but shiftier. He looks as if he's gonna run. Shits getting real right here. I'm thinking on me feet, so I wait till he's doing his little scenery scan and just go 'oh look she wants a cuddle!' And grab her right out of his arms. I've got her sitting on my hip now and I'm clinging on to her like she's my oxygen.
He realises what's happened and just turns and slowly walks away. Like, if you're her uncle you'd be fighting and screaming to get the kid back and he just disappears. 

My heart is pumping like mad and this girl is just sitting there obviously oblivious to the danger she was in.  After standing for a minute or two regaining my composure, I start circling the park thinking someone will recognise her. As I'm walking I'm going to her 'sweetie, where's your daddy? Is he here? Where's daddy?' And she's going 'dadadadada'.. Helpful. 

Then this fairly old lady, maybe 65 comes over cooing over her and the girl outstretches her arms so it's pretty clear she knows this old biddy. 
Me: is this your daughter?
Lady: oh gosh no! This is my granddaughter!
I hand her over and I'm like 'by the way, what's her name?'
Thankfully this woman goes 'Ava.' I'm breathing a sigh of relief by this point. I say something along the lines of 'There was a guy with her over there saying he's her uncle, he's left now.' Before turning and walking away, I have no idea what this lady was thinking when she heard that but yeah. 

TL;DR took a small child out of the arms of a possible perv/criminal.

1358955580.0	174jhc	Attack of the weeabo		964	135	310	"Hey everyone, before I begin, I am Japanese and English is not my first language, so sorry if there are some mistakes.

For about 1 year now, I have been studying in Australia, but at first I was sometimes too shy to meet Australians and become friends. Mostly I worried about what to talk about. Because of that, within 2 weeks of living here, I decided to join my university's anime and manga club.

Now, there is a really huge subculture in Australia (maybe other western countries too) for anime and manga. I had not any knowledge about this. In Japan, at least in my hometown, it is more like something everyone does in moderation. We have some people who really love to dress up as their beloved characters (I think it's called kosuplay?) and things like that, but not as much as here I think. So, I didn't know this and I thought that I would meet some cool, relaxed people who were interested in some Japanese pop-culture, which means that I could easily find a topic to have a conversation about. 

Anyway, I went to my first meeting and it was really nice. Everyone was kind and I chatted a lot, and then this girl came and joined the conversation I was having. She seemed interesting, because she had cat ears attached to her head. I thought it was pretty funny, actually. She started looking at me strangely, and then she said very abruptly ""are you Japanese?"" I said yes, I am, and introduced myself. She said ""Sugoi!"" which means awesome in Japanese, so I asked her ""hey, you can speak some Japanese! What is your name?""

That is when things got strange.

She told me her name was neko-chan (neko means cat, chan is like a name suffix, which you can't use for yourself. It sounds very strange when you say it with your own name), and that she could speak Japanese fluently. I laughed and asked her what her real name is, and she kept saying it was neko-chan. So I gave up, and asked her to say some Japanese things, but I noticed they were all very short sentences and her pronunciation was very difficult to understand. Also, she talked in a strange way, even in English (I think it's called three person perspective. In Japanese we call it 三人称 *sanninshou*, maybe someone can help me out? お願い！). So she would say things like ""neko-chan thinks you're *kawaii*!"" But who knows, maybe she is a beginner? Also it's not uncommon for Japanese girls to speak like this, but I think it's childish, and I have never seen western woman do this. Anyway, I was glad she was at least trying to speak my language, so I had a good time teaching her some words. However each time I taught her something, she would tell me she already knew it, which I think was a lie.

So for the rest of the night, I could not escape her. It was like I was her hostage! She would ask me opinions on anime and manga she liked, and then say some small Japanese words mostly like kawaii and sugoi. She would then try and act like some characters for me, and she even had some theme songs memorised in Japanese. Finally the night was ending, so I told her I had better go, I had class next morning. She followed me to the bus stop and waited with me for the bus, but she was still strange to me. When the bus arrived, she asked for my number. I think the problem with Japanese is we are too polite, I couldn't say no because it would be rude. So I reluctantly gave her my mobile number and I said goodbye, and got on the bus. 

It took her 3 minutes to send a message to me, saying that I was kakkoii (cool) and sekushii (sexy). She always said half a sentence in terrible Japanese and the rest in English, it was so confusing. By this point I was getting really annoyed. She would not stop sending messages! But I was so shy and dislike confrontation, so I kept replying. She eventually told me her dream, which was to have Japanese boyfriend. I said sorry, but I was not looking for a girlfriend, but we could be friends. She stopped sending messages after that.

The next day I had school in the morning for 2 hours, and afterwards, as I was leaving my classroom, I saw her waiting outside. I asked her what she was doing here, she told me ""neko-chan was waiting for you."" I still don't understand how she knew when and where my class was! I was so freaked out. She told me neko-chan had a surprise for me, and she took out an art book with lots of drawings. I admit, she was creepy, but she was a very good artist. She searched through the book which was full of very nice manga drawings, and towards the end she showed me the most disturbing thing I've seen. It was a manga of two men having sex, both of them had tails and cat ears. It was very graphic, I can still remember how detailed it was. I won't make too many details though. Anyway, she pointed to one of them and said ""neko-chan drew you!""

I just stood there, I was like a statue. I had no idea what to do or say, so I just said quietly ""thank you, but I have another class. I'll see you later,"" and I walked away quickly. I was so disturbed and I felt sick. I called my tutor, because he was Australian and he was my age, so maybe he could tell me what to do. I tried to explain to him with my terrible English that a girl had drawn a picture of me having sex with another man and that I did not know what to do. Once he understood (at first he didn't believe me I think) he could not stop laughing, but he agreed to meet with me and take me to report her. So we did, but when we got there I realised I never know her real name, just neko-chan. The campus security asked me to send her a message asking to meet in the courtyard so they could see her and escort her off campus. So I sent her a message saying that I really liked the drawing, and she should come meet so we could talk about dating. I felt terrible because it was a lie, but I didn't want her to keep doing this. 

She met me 20 minutes later. She came and sat down, and she had no chances to say anything before two security men came over and asked her questions. I could not really understand, because they spoke so fast, but eventually they took her away. I will never forget the look she gave me as they did, it was like mixed sadness and anger. I felt truly terrible. Afterwards they told me that she wasn't even a student at the university, and she was actually 15 years old. Only 15! I had no idea. Anyway, I have never seen her since then and I didn't return to that club, even though the other members were normal. When I think about it I still get freaked out. That day, my tutor taught me the meaning of the word ""weeabo."" "	t5_2t3t8	True
1330829229.0	qgons	I Escaped out the Window - Peeping Tom/Rapist 	trixare4kids	909	110	101	"I posted this elsewhere a few years ago on Reddit for another thread, but thought the story was good enough for this sub too.  I also edited it a little bit for clarity. 

I am female and I was 16 when this happened years ago. 

There were two incidents that happened before the really scary incident.

We lived in a fairly new residential neighborhood and night about 10 PM I was laying in bed doing homework and I heard this tapping/scratching at my window.  My mother wasn't home that night and my father was already asleep. I jumped out of bed and ran into his room and said, ""DAD! Someone is outside tapping on my window!"" My dad who thought I was being a hysterical teenager peeked out how own window and said, ""Eh.. it was probably a tree branch or something.""  He then went back to bed. My father was a lazy bastard, I tell ya, couldn't even be bothered to go look out my window or outside, never mind the fact there was no bush or tree near enough to touch the window.  I was creeped out, but I double checked no one could see in my bedroom and that the curtains covered everything &amp; went back to bed.

A few weeks later I am sitting in the living room - it's just me and my mom home. I had just finished taking a shower and I was lounging in a towel while talking to my mom and painting my toenails.  Suddenly we both heard a tapping/scratching noise at the side window. My mom was *pissed*  She immediately jumped up and went outside where she confronted a man.  The man walked off. She ran in the house and called the police.

The police came and they caught the guy a few blocks away and my mom identified him as the man who was peeking in the window. The man claimed that he was just back there between the houses because he had to take a leak. The police said, ""Okay..so if you took a leak, where's the urine?"" There was none.

He was hauled off to jail, for at least trespassing, I'm not sure if he was charged with being a peeping tom or not.

Fast forward about a month later. I woke up in the middle of the night because my cat suddenly jumped off the bed. I heard a slight noise in the hallway. I tip-toed to my bedroom door and peeked out and THERE HE WAS -- THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN PEEKING. *THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP** was all I could hear, it was my heart racing.   The moment I saw him, he was standing in the doorway of my little sister's room WITH A GUN IN HIS HAND and he was just starting to close the door.  He had a gun in one hand and a bag in the other.  That wasn't the room he wanted. I was sure I was about to die a horrible death after being raped.

I've never, ever had an adrenaline rush so big in my life -- not even years later when I jumped out of a perfectly good airplane to sky dive a few times.

I was suddenly and powerfully ALERT -- I'm telling you that I had super strength, hearing and sight. It might be my imagination, but I swear I could see, hear and smell better than normal -- and effect of all that adrenaline.

Within a few seconds I considered my options.

Scream? He had a gun. My father would come running and get shot.

Hide in the closet or under the bed? He'd find me.

Try and fight him? He had a gun.

This was before cell phones and I didn't have a phone in my room. So, without any hesitation, I quickly I opened up my window and jumped out, bare feet onto the gravel. I am the kind of girl with ZERO upper body strength, and yet I was able to get up and out that window, quickly and quietly, with hardly any effort. Landing on the gravel in bare feet didn't even hurt a tiny bit.

Did I mention that I was completely nude? Yeah, I slept in the nude. What can I say, it was summer and warm..

I ran balls-out about three houses down to a neighbors house and banged on the door. Let me tell you, as a 16 year old girl, the thought of anyone seeing you naked is horrifying beyond belief. But.. in that moment, I didn't care for one second.

I went three houses down because I didn't want the creepy man to hear me banging on a door. When I didn't get an immediate response, I went to the next house and banged on their door.  The whole time I'm terrified for my family in my house. 

Finally someone at this house answered the door quickly and I just got out ""Man in my house, Call the police! Man in my house!"" They called 911. The police where there really fast -- they came in without lights and sirens and they caught the guy in the house IN MY ROOM.

This is what he brought with him: A gun, a bag (rape kit) that included rope, tape, two exacto knives, a couple of dildos, bondage porn magazines, bleach, condoms, lube, ball gag, pliers, and.. maybe some other stuff that I can't remember off the top of my head.

Luckily it never went to court, he was did a plea bargain and got 25-life for a whole slew of charges. He's still in prison and will be for the rest of his life because a few year after going to jail, he got a life sentence for committing a murder while inside prison.  The DA who had handled my case called me to tell me.  Thank god.

I didn't sleep well again for a number of years. I would wake up numerous times per night at the slightest noise or even hint of noise.

It wasn't until I got a dog that I was able to sleep. I let my dog do his job -- warn me of any noise - and now I can sleep. It didn't hurt that I also got a gun and keep it near me when I sleep. I took a gun safety class, lessons, and I go to the range every month without fail.

I will kill any mother fucker who comes into my house in the night.

1368945276.0	1embwh	When Stalkers Try to Be Heroes: Or How I Almost Got Arrested For Bringing a Friend Some Coffee	Drunken_Black_Belt	963	201	134	"Alright everyone. First let me say that I posted this in r/talesfromretail.  My stories tend to be very light and jovial, so I was nervous posting here. But being that it involves stalking and creepiness, I was told to post here.  Just saying please don't take offense if it seems I'm making light of the situation. 

A little background: I'm a big guy, but very laid back.  I am non confrontational, but have found myself in situations where I've had to defend myself at work.  I am a sleeping lion. I'm fine as long as you don't try and Mufasa me. 

So about 6-7 years ago I was in college, doing my thing. Drinking, partying, smoking, random hook ups and failed attempts. You know the deal.

I only lived an hour or so from home, so i would often return home when I needed laundry, free food, etc. One such weekend I was returning home, when I recieved a text from a friend, we shall call ""Marie"". She said she wanted to hang out, but she had to close at her office supply store. So we decided that I would head over around 10, and when she was done, we'd take my car to the beach and catch up. Beach is like 10 mins from where I live, so it was a pretty common place to hang out. I should also note that she was in HS, a really old friend of mine, and there was no romantic inclinations in our relationship. She's gorgeous, a solid 10, with killer curves and an amazing personality. But growing up knowing each other, it never really got to that place for either of us.

So I pull into the parking lot, park my car, and shoot her a text saying ""here"". Smooth talking devil I am. Have such a way with words. She says she'll be like 15 mins or so. No big deal. So I shut my car off, get out of the car,and take a seat on my hood. About 10 mins later, a guy comes walking out of the store, stops, looks at my car, and starts walking over. He's wearing the stores uniform, and is striding over with a sense of authority. But he was also maybe 5'5 and 120 lbs soaking wet. 

Anyways, he walks over, and with all of the authority of Paula Deen talking about health food, says ""Hey man, can I help you?""

Me: Nah man. Just waiting for a friend. Thanks.

Guy: Well, WHO is your friend?

Now, his tone was a little shitty, but I can understand a persons concerns about a stranger hanging out in a dark parking lot at night while their store closes. Being LP at the time, I just played it nice...

Me: Marie. Just waiting for her to finish up.

Guy: Marie huh? And what are you guys going to do?

Me: That's none of your damn business.

Guy: What's your name?

Me: Drunken_Black_Belt

Guy: Can I see some ID proving that?

Me: Are you asking as a representative of your company? Because I know for a fact that you have no right to demand that of me.

Guy: No, just a concerned citizen.

Me: Well, it's none of your concern. Btw, whats your name?

Guy: Kurt

Me: Well Kurt, nice to meet you. One of Marie's friends. So I'd appreciate it if you'd stop harassing me. I can understand your apprehension about a random guy in a parking lot late at night in the dark. I work LP and walk my associates out all the time for the same reasons. But you don't have anything to worry about. 

Kurt: Well then you wouldn't mind if we called the cops to verify your story?

Me: Seriously? Go ahead. Would love to see you explain to your bosses why your calling cops on customers and random people in the parking lot for no reason.

So Kurt wanders off, back into the store. Marie shoots me a text saying ""Hold on, some guy's harassing me, be right out."" Several minutes later she comes out, with Kurt on her heels. I can see him trying to stop her, pointing at me, waving his arms, etc. Marie pushes past him, and walks over to me. Give each other a quick hug and a ""howdy stranger!"". We turn our head and who should be standing right next to us? Yup

Marie: Kurt, what is it? I told you I know him, he's fine. 

Kurt: (To me) You know she has a bf right? And it's not you

Me: Yup. Not you either. And I'm sure he wouldn't appreciate you implying that she's the type who would cheat on someone. Cuz I can see sure as shit she doesn't appreciate it. And I'm not sure I appreciate it either. 

Kurt: I.. I didn't mean. I just. Not to say you would do that Marie, I just...

To steal a phrase I saw recently, it was more awkward than playing ""Got your nose"" with Voldermort.

Kurt walked to his car, red faced, and Marie apologized. She told me the kid was obsessed with her and constantly following her around. He only went outside after she said she had a friend from college waiting for her. And that he wanted to ""make sure I was an ok guy"".

So we get in the car, and he pulls his car in front of mine, blocking me in. Gets out of his car, takes out his camera phone, takes a picture of my license plate. I begin to step out of my car when he hops back in his and takes off. I was pissed. I could understand someone being apprehensive, but this was fucking ridiculuos. 

So me and Marie chill, catch up, etc. Bring her back to her car, call it a night.  Next day she shows me several texts sent from Kurt, saying things like ""Want to make sure you're ok. That guy looked sketchy. Just text me when you're home ok. You sure you should be hanging out with guys like that?  I'm only looking out for you. You're so pretty and just know you don't know how guys can be.  Can you call me? Wanna know you're alright. Etc Etc"".  About 10 messages in total were sent to her till about 3 am or so.  Then another in the morning saying ""DID YOU MAKE IT HOME! I SAW YOU UPDATED FB! YOU OK?

The story is bad enough. But trust me dear reader, like a virgin on his second go, it get's better.

Next weekend I'm back in town, and need some blank CD's, because that's how we rolled back then. Naturally Marie says come visit her and buy them at her store. So I grab some coffee for both of us, and head over. I see she's with customers, so I walk by, placing the coffee on her register, and she says she'll be on break in 5 mins. So I wander around, grab my cd's, and do some random browsing. 

I'm in the back of the store, looking at who knows what, when I hear cough cough behind me. I turn, and HEY IT'S FUCKING KURT! YAY!

He has a shit eating grin on his face, and he get's close, his face getting in my chest. He strains his neck to look up, and whispers ""Hey asshole""

Me: Excuse me?

Kurt: What the fuck you doing here? 

Me: What do you want?

Kurt: You, gone. I don't trust you. She's mine. She'll be single soon and I'll make her mine.

This of course, was met with racaus laughter from me. A laugh to rival that of Tormund Giantsbane. HAR!

Kurt: Laugh it up. I know you're stealing those cd's. I can bring you in right now, then you won't be allowed here. See what she thinks of you then. 

Me: Actually, I'm buying these, and you're not LP. So no, you couldn't do that. I don't know what you're problem is but...

Kurt: I got you on camera. 

Me: You guys don't have cameras.

Kurt: All I have to do is say I saw you. 

At this point, I had it with this mother fucker. I was ready to explode. Like a well hung pornstar walking nude on set, I was ready to start swinging. That's when Kurt made his biggest mistake. He grabbed my wrist.

Nope! I wripped my wrist free, pushed him back, and put my forearm across his throat, pinning him against a display.

Me: Listen here you little shit. I don't know what the fuck your problem is, but you better stop being a creepy little shit.

And that's when his manager walked around the corner and saw us. It obviously didn't look good for me. I looked guiltier than Jodi Arias. The manager broke us up, and Kurt immediatly started saying I attacked him after he caught me stealing. I denied it of course, saying this guy has bee harrassing me since the other night. Manager said he was calling the cops, and told me to come with him. Fine, I'm not gonna cause an issue. We go to the back room, and naturally Marie see's me being led back there by her manager, and has a ""WTF"" look on her face. Kurt is beaming like he just got a blow job from Michelle Obama while forcing Barack to watch. Dude couldn't be prouder.

We get in the back, and before I can even begin to explain my side, Marie comes in the back asking what the fuck is going on. 

Tip to all would be liars. When you're already getting away with something, keep your mouth shut....

Kurt: Well he was in here stalking you again and I told him to back off and leave you alone. Then when tried to push him out the store he attacked me.

Manager: Wait, so you touched him first? And this is about her? Not him stealing?

Kurt: Well, umm. He was gonna steal those! I know it.

So we sat down, I explained everything from my side, Marie backed me up. Apparently, the week before, Kurt came in with a guitar and attempted to serenade Marie in the break room with everyone there. Marie complained, and he was talked to for harassment, and they were to be seperated on the schedule where possible. Several other employees had also come to the manager after that incident saying he would call to see if she had come in for her shift yet, when he was on his day off, and show up randomly.

 Luckily for me the manager saw what was really going on, and sided with me. He apologized, and asked if I wanted to press charges. I decided not to, but Marie said she wasn't comfortable with him working with her. Manager said they'd have to do an official investigation, but that he wouldn't work till a decision was made. Kurt was left in the back room while the manager did paperwork, and Marie was cut out early for her trouble. Kurt looked like I just kicked his favorite puppy into a woodchipper and then made him watch while his grandma blew me.  Look of defeat and submission doesn't even begin to describe it.  He started crying and attempting to apologize to Marie, saying he just wanted her to give him a chance.  It was incredibly sad.

Found out a week later Kurt was fired, and caused a scene being escorted out of the store. He continued to text Marie until she threatened getting a restraining order against him. I don't know what happened to him after that. I'm sure he's still creepy. Marie &amp; I are stll good friends. In fact next weekend I'm going with my g/f to her engagement party to eat bbq and get shit faced. 

TL;DR- AAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEEE Awee-mum-mum-bo way! In the jungle, the quiet jungle...

1373992995.0	1if89y	"""Don't tell mom"""	googlyeyegal	881	125	92	"My sister and I recently stumbled across a memory during our weekly visits.

We had just moved to a suburb, our first house in a decent but isolated part of town. She was 12 I was 7.

Mom let us take our white German Shepard for a walk.  I remember the sun was setting over the desert landscape, but we weren't worried. It was nice to be able to walk unsupervised down the street. We lavished in our freedom and took our time, letting Kodak sniff and and investigate everything.  We had just let him off the lead and were watching him chase a rabbit. 

I guess that's why we didn't hear the car pull up nor the huge man that that was sneaking up behind us. 

Kodak was a ways off and suddenly he turned back and looked at us, and like a streak of white lightening he raced back towards us. He flew, I'm for sure his feet touched the earth. He blasted past our waiting arms and landed on the man behind us. 

We turned, and Kodak was latched on the mans arm. Kodak was a big dog, with big teeth and was absolutely shredding this guys arm. The man eventually got him off of him and Kodak took a stance between us and the man. 

We apologized to the creep not realizing what danger we were in, the man offered a shaky smile and told us we were good kids and stumbled off to his car.  I remember there being a length of rope on the ground, which now I assume he had been holding. 

We looked at Kodak, he was growling and continued to growl until we made it home and he escorted us on the house. My sister told me ""don't tell mom or they'll kill Kodak for biting someone""

It was so naive, we thought we were protecting our pet but in actuality he saved one or both of us from a terrible fate.  Much later I learned my hometown is an area heavy in sexual predators and violent criminals, many of the surrounding communities had passed legislation that wouldn't allow them to live in their towns so the lived in ours. No wonder our house was so cheap! 

 Knowing now what was likely that man's the intentions I'm glad Kodak was there. Kodak died five years later, we buried him in the backyard and planted a tree over him.

1370271839.0	1fl124	I went on one date with the guy. It got real crazy, real fast.	the_ilz_have_eyes	859	110	47	"Last October, I went to a Halloween party where my friend's band was playing. I was introduced to the drummer, and he seemed nice. He was friendly, funny, and I thought he was pretty good looking. We didn't talk much, but at the end of the night he asked if we could hang out again. I agreed, and went home and added him on facebook.

We didn't really talk much via facebook, but exchanged numbers and texted back and forth a bit. My friends said he is a friendly, normal guy, so it seemed okay. He asked if he could take me out to dinner the first week of November, and I was pretty excited about it.

Date night rolls around. I meet him at the restaurant, and we seem to really hit it off. There were two red flags that came up, but they seemed pretty innocuous so I didn't think twice about it.

RF #1 - I'm 25, and I found out on the date that he is 38. That's not enough for me to completely write him off, but that's a pretty big age gap.

RF #2 - He complained a lot about women he had dated before not approving of his job. (He is a caddy at a PGA golf course)

Anyway, the date was fun, and I left genuinely feeling like I wanted to see him again. I warned him ahead of time though that I had family visiting me the next two weeks and I'd be out of town for Thanksgiving. (Usually I'm not that busy! It was just bad timing.) I was really apologetic, but asked if we could keep in touch and hopefully get together again when I got home from my Thanksgiving trip. He seemed fine with it, we said our good byes, and that was that.

The following week, we texted back and forth a bit. It seemed fine at first, but then his texts started getting stranger and almost...controlling. He wanted to know where I was all the time. He started complaining about how busy I was and that I was never home. (Of course I wasn't! My family was visiting and I was showing them around my city!) Then the phone calls started.

He would call a bunch of times in a row, all hours of the night and day. By the time my Thanksgiving trip rolled around, I was turning my phone off just to avoid it. Finally I sent him a text message that said, ""Hey, I don't think this is going to work out. I'm sorry. Please stop contacting me.""

The week after Thanksgiving I didn't have access to my phone. By the time I got it back again, I had about 15 voicemails from that one week. Then the really sinister texts started.

""Hey, I bet you look cute at the laundromat!"" Uhm, how did you know I was at the laundromat? The only person who knows is my mom. I didn't post it anywhere. I didn't tell anyone. It's not near his neighborhood.

""I didn't know you shopped at [certain neighborhood grocery store]!"" Again, how? It's not anywhere near where you live. 

It was becoming apparent he was following me. Eventually my friends urged me to call the police, so I filed a report and they told me to call if he contacted me again.

By this time it was the week after Christmas. I woke to a text threatening me if I should return back to my city from visiting my parents a few states away because I ""waste the time of decent Southern men."" I called the cops immediately.

Apparently they contacted him and told him if he contacted me again that he could be arrested. I thankfully haven't heard from him since, but I still live in fear like never before. I never saw him in the time he was following me, so I often worry he's still following me and just not contacting me. It gives me chills to think about."	t5_2t3t8	True
1338149016.0	u7nip	The Bridge; Revisited.	NobilityScooter	888	168	149	"For any of you guys who missed the original post; you can find it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/tj2uc/the_bridge/).

Early yesterday evening, a friend and I decided to embark on the revisit to this awful place, in the hope of finding some remnants of the twisted scene that had been stumbled upon several years ago. 

We were *not* disappointed. If anything, it was even worse than I had imagined. 

Aside from what you will see in the photos, the general environment within the bridge structure is practically uninhabitable (as it bloody well should be!), and stomach-turning to say the least.

The amount of dust in the passageways is actually quite unbearable, but that is nothing compared to the constant stench that must be endured. Also, the heat didn't help the situation either. 

I won't ramble on, but I must express how vulnerable you feel when navigating through the tunnels. Even with two of us, both carrying appropriate weaponry, the sense of 'evil' was overpowering. The tension is amplified tenfold by the fact that, had we encountered someone or something, the layout of the structure, and the multiple tight-squeezes, mean a safe, speedy exit is nigh on impossible. It truly is a hell-hole.

Without further ado; [here](http://imgur.com/a/JYb8a) is what lies in The Bridge. Enjoy...

1354627614.0	149e3n	My roommate's boyfriend sexually assaulted me while I was asleep.	fourfivedicks	853	153	86	"This happened just about two weeks ago. I live in a two bedroom apartment with my long-time friend, Mark. We've been friends since we were in diapers, and now we're both 22-year-old college students. We're regular guys; I play video games, hoot 'n holler at the women, and I just consider myself a regular guy. Mark is the same, except that he's gay, but that is so completely irrelevant to who he is as a person.

(Before I start this story, I just want to say that I am *NOT* homophobic [which is what homophobic people usually say...], but I have a sister that's lesbian, and a younger brother that's bisexual--my poor parents; one lesbian, one straight, and the other bi. Mark was raised like my brother, so there's another gay.)

ANNNYWAY, onto the story.

Last month, around November 3rd if I recall, Mark brought home this guy. He was really handsome, was clean-shaven, was wearing the remnants of a business suit, he was our age--25, Mark said. His name was Chad, and he was Mark's new love interest. I greeted Chad and welcomed him into our humble abode.

Chad was great! He played Halo with me, we talked about cars, he offered to let me borrow some of his CoD games when he was over the next time. (Hell, even *I* was developing a crush on this guy!)

This went on for about two weeks; Chad would come over, Mark would cook him dinner, and then Chad would hang out with me. I was growing to like him. 

One night, I decided to turn in early, because I had an exam the next morning. Chad and Mark stayed up to watch a movie, but I heard them go into Mark's bedroom, but I fell asleep soon after. It was probably like three hours later when I was woken up by the sound of my door clicking shut. Normally, I'm a very heavy sleeper, able to sleep through very loud 5am construction with my windows open. But this woke me up.

Groggy and slightly agitated, I squinted to see what made the sound. I could barely make out Chad. He wasn't wearing a shirt, and he was staring right at me: wide eyes, a look of fear on his face. I felt a chill run down my spine, and I was on alert.

""What are you doing, Chad?"" I sat up, turning on my light. Chad ironed his face into a normal look.

""I thought I heard you call my name."" He said it in a whisper, as if he didn't want anyone to hear. He was acting really weird, and I felt creeped the fuck out. We stared at each other awkwardly for about 10-15 seconds, then he apologized and left.

The next morning, Chad acted as if everything was normal. I didn't sleep much after he left. I told Mark about what happened, and he didn't seem concerned. He just said that Chad was probably sleepwalking or dreaming. I wasn't convinced, but I soon forgot about it (full-time student with a full-time job, I don't have time to dwell on personal dramas).

Two nights later, Chad was back over again. I was sick with a cold, so I took some NyQuil and went to bed after a few games of Assassin's Creed with Chad. It was 5:36 AM when I heard my door close, because I remember my eyes popping open and looking right at my alarm clock. But before I could process what was going on, I felt a hand clamp across my mouth, and another deliver a harsh blow against my Adam's apple. I started choking.

It was *Chad*. He was on top of me, and I was struggling to get him off. I threw him against the wall, which only subdued him for a second. I rolled onto the floor, but I couldn't speak because of my gagging from the hit to my throat.

Chad pulled me down, wrestled me into submission, and began pulling on my boxer briefs. He kept ""*shhhing*"" me, telling me that it would be over soon, and that he knew I was curious. I was frantic, and I was slow because of the NyQuil I had consumed, but I managed to roll over, just as Chad took off his pants, and I kicked him off of me. I was able to hit him in the balls, which made him shout out in pain.

Then Mark burst inside, saw Chad with his pants down and me trying to catch my breath. The look on Mark's face is one that I'll never forget; heartbroken and angered and confused all at once. 

Chad stood up, said I tried to beat him, etc, but Mark went insane and almost beat the shit out of him. I pulled him off, and Mark gave Chad an ultimatum: either he calls the cops, or he gets the fuck out and doesn't come back.

Chad left immediately, but Mark still called the cops and told them what happened. They came by, took our statements, and we got a call two days later that Chad was in custody and he confessed. Mark also let out a small detail: Chad did cocaine, which was in his system when he was picked up.

But, Mark is recovering, but he still feels guilty, I think, for having it happen. He keeps apologizing every time I see him, but shit happens. I'm just glad that Mark wasn't hurt by him.

Alright, that's my interesting story. Off to take a final exam now! Thanks, r/LetsNotMeet!

**EDIT**: I showed this to Mark, and he wanted to say thanks to all of you for being so kind!"	t5_2t3t8	True
1344732061.0	y2lhc	You're not a child, ma'am.	GrilledZombieMeat	806	116	39	"This took place about 4 or 5 years back. I had a house in a nice neighborhood, nothing too odd For security purposes, we got a video camera put above our front door so we could view the people at the door before going up to the window. It also has audio and a microphone so I could talk to the people if I had to.

One day in the middle of summer, someone rang our doorbell. I go up to our video screen and turn it on to view the person who rang the doorbell. 

I saw a woman, with sandy brown hair standing and looking directly at our door.

""Yes?""

I said through the intercom.
She replied back in a very squeeky childish voice,

""We are selling cookies, mister. Come out and buy some?""

I looked at her again, she had nothing with her, no cookies, no clipboard, nothing.

""Um, I see you and I know you aren't a child.""

She looked around very quickly, looking scared. She looked directly at the camera, flipped it off, then ran down the street.  I am never buying cookies now.

1370210378.0	1fjiyt	I don't think I'm alone in my house. I don't know for sure, but I'm scared to find out.	Varasque	740	113	275	"I *hope* this belongs here. I'm not sure because there's been no actual encounter with someone yet, is that against the subreddit rules? I don't know, but I'm going to post anyway because I really want to get this off my chest and maybe hear some other people's thoughts.

Ok so some background. I live in a house with 8 people in total. It's quite a large, old, Victorian style house. We're all students, but as it's summer, people have started to move out. For the last week or so there's only been three of us in the house. Myself, my boyfriend and another housemate.

With our house being so full of people, it's easy to put strange things happening down to it being any one of those 7 other people. But now there's only three of us, I'm becoming increasingly paranoid that there's someone living in our house that shouldn't be.

I'm going to try and structure the events that make me think so as best I can now.

**1.** Above our shower, there's an attic. You can see the little black attic hatch which has always been a crack open since we moved in. I know it's been open because my boyfriend would get creeped out by it and tell me so. But recently, the crack shut. 

Now, this house has VERY high ceilings. I'm only 5""2 and a half so there's no way I can reach up there. My other housemate isn't much taller and although my boyfriend is more so, he probably still isn't tall enough. And that hatch creeps him out too much for him to go opening it. (I've asked, he's not). So there's that.

**2.** Four out of eight people in our house smoke. So there's often tobacco and rolling papers lying around the front room or kitchen. For a long time now, since maybe January or so, we've been finding these really badly rolled cigarettes in the mornings. My boyfriend and I would come downstairs in the morning, and we'd find one of these shitty cigarettes rolled just sitting in the tobacco; like someone had rolled it then decided it isn't good enough to smoke and just leaving it for us to find. 

At first we had a laugh about it, assuming it was one of our housemates who smokes only when drinking and was attempting to roll secretly because of embarrassment.  But then that housemate left. Which brings us onto:

**3.** My boyfriend bought me a lollypop a few days earlier (one of those oversized swirly ones) and he and I were stood in the kitchen with cigarettes one day when I put the lollypop on the fridge. Cut to a little later, we go back, and see that yet another one of these badly rolled cigarettes has appeared; only this time it has been half smoked and stubbed out on the lolly. 

Neither me or my bf would have stubbed out a cigarette on a lolly he bought me. We were the only people in the house at the time (or should have been).

**4.**Smaller and not exactly scary, but still another odd example of something happening. Our recycling bins were an absolute mess. We came back from the shop (my bf and I) one day and they were all neatly stacked and tidy. Weird.


**5.** Now this is the thing that has weirded me out the most out of everything for some reason. My boyfriend and I had been away for the weekend, and one of our housemates was just coming back the day before we were. He said the house was creeping him out a bit so he turned off all the lights on the day he was there alone and just stayed in his room until we got back.

My bf and I get home, find our other housemate, start chatting and mentions of odd happenings like those mentioned above came up. So we're all a bit confused, maybe a bit creeped out, but more intrigued than anything. Whatever, don't think about it. All three of us chat about other stuff and end up going to bed at the same time.

My boyfriend and I were awake in bed for a while, so we would have heard my housemate leaving his room if he had done, but we didn't. The next morning, I head downstairs, the first one up, and I notice something straight away that was not there the night before.

Tiny little barcode stickers, from some nail art sticker sheets I had, were all stuck in a sort of •• shape on the sofa. Lots of them, just in this sort of hourglass number 8 sort of shape. First thing I do, get my housemate and ask him if he's been downstairs. He says no, asks why, I show him the stickers. He's as weirded out and intrigued as I am. My boyfriend isn't up yet but just to check, I go and ask him if it was him. Nope. They're still there. I can get a picture if anyone really wanted. We've tried taking them off but they're little bastards to pull off, they leave marks on the sofa.

Bearing in mind we have a damage deposit on this house we all want back, so it's safe to say noone in our house who wants that money back is going to damage furniture like that.




All of these things are alongside banging and sounds like footsteps or taps being turned on or things being dragged across the floor. The sounds are worrying enough but I always put it down to it being an  old house, or one of the other many people we know living there, or even the neighbours.

Another point of interest which I only realised lately. My boyfriend lost his house keys a good while back. Anyone could have picked up these keys and found out where we live.



I'm currently at my parents house. But the more I stay at my own house, the more it seems the only explanation for these things happening is there is someone living in our attic. And it scares the shit out of me. So much I refuse to check.


What do you think Reddit? Do I get someone to check? Or can you come up with another suitable explanation for all of this going-on? What do I do if there is someone up in my attic? I'm scared to go back to my own house.




**TL:DR: I think there's someone living in my attic but too scared to check**



**EDIT**: Holy shit I was not expecting this response. Thanks guys. I think. These responses have made everything feel way more real than before when I thought I was just being paranoid. Clearing a few things up:

I'll try get my boyfriend to message me a photo of the stickers. He's currently the only one in the house. Oh fuck. 

I'm currently at home as stated. I was supposed to go home tomorrow (tuesday) but due to a family member going into hospital I've got to stay here for another week. So I won't be back until some point next week. Sorry about that, you'll probably all have forgotten by then, I know it's a long time to wait for an update but I promise you I will update.

I'm thinking we should get the cops to do a sweep of our house and attic after reading the comments. I'm too much of a wuss to let me or my housemates do anything alone, and we don't own any small cameras that would be convenient. So police it is I guess? I'm gonna say this to my boyfriend and housemate (although he's gone home now) so that if anyone has been pranking, they'll fess up.

Why I haven't done anything until now: I thought I was being way over paranoid in my head, I usually am. 'What's the chances of someone living in your house? hahaha you're so stupid'. So turns out that's not as stupid or rare as I thought. I've seen you posting stories and videos of things that have happened but I've not clicked on them. I'd definitely shit myself.

So long story short, most likely will call the police but I'm not going back for another week due to family issues. I pinky promise to update when I do though. Thanks for the massive response though, cheers Reddit.

**EDIT NUMBER 2**: A photo of the stickers. Sorry for the shitty quality, my boyfriends phone kinda sucks. The shape isn't as clear anymore either because we've tried picking them off (as you can see at the bottom where they're all faded) but yeah sorry I'm ranting.

1336786411.0	tj2uc	The Bridge 	NobilityScooter	731	121	197	"This is (was) going to be short, but the memory sprung into my mind a couple days back and I thought it would be worth sharing.

I live in North Wales, UK. For anyone who has had the pleasure of visiting, it truly is a beautiful place to live, though, for an adolescent boy, it is certainly lacking in things to do.  As a result, my friends and I would often find ourselves mindlessly exploring areas of countryside and coastline.

Despite it being quite sparsely populated, in comparison to the closest cities, there is a dual carriageway running right along the coast from Wales into England. Also, train tracks run alongside this road for most of its course, occasionally passing overhead via a small cement bridge.

Anyway, there was one night a few years ago, when about four of us randomly decided to try and explore the inside of one of these bridges, as one of the group had observed a man-hole cover nearby which we believed to be the entrance. On closer inspection, we discovered that several tools would be required in order to gain entry.

We returned with the necessary equipment and proceeded to unbolt the cover. This had to be done stealthily as the train track was right beside us, not close enough to be of any danger, but definitely a sufficiently small distance to cause panic for any train driver. And panic usually means Police. 

It wasn't long before we had removed the heavy steel disc, and had started descending the ladder down into the structure. Once we had all safely reached the bottom, we decided to progress to the other side. At this point, we are totally confined into the narrow space that leads into the main area. If you are confused as to what the hell this 'bridge' is supposed to be, you probably should be, because it was rather peculiar. I mean, I would have never known there was even an inside had we not found the man-hole.

So, as we squeeze and crouch, and at one point scrape along our bellies, to the other side of the structure there is a growing sense of claustrophobia between us. The distance from end to the other is surprisingly long, but by the halfway point you can look down through narrow gaps onto the motorway below. This was actually pretty cool, which helped keep us calm, in a strange way.

At this point, apart from the mild discomfort and confinement, we were still just a group of guys on an adventure. This was about to change dramatically.

No more than a few metres beyond halfway (which we could tell due to the symmetry of the passageways through the bridge), one of us claimed they could see some object in the distance at the far end. Slightly hesitantly, we agreed to investigate. Bad move.

I reached the end first, and let me tell you, I have never felt the same sense of dread before or since. In front of me was a single fold-away chair positioned facing a wall. On the wall was a partially torn page from a newspaper, or a magazine, showing a fully naked lady in an erotic position. The reason I don't just refer to it as 'porn' is because something was different about it; I can't put my finger on it but it seemed more sinister than sexy, if that makes any sense.

More disturbingly the eyes of the woman on display had been cut from the page. Removed with precision, not just hastily ripped off. The scene that lay before us had rendered us completely speechless, and an overpowering sense of panic could be felt collectively. That was when we found the condom. The horrendous, gut-wrenching, blood-drenched condom.

Needless to say we got the fuck out of there as fast as humanly possible, smashing our knees and shins against the sharp cement edges, that lined the path to the ladder by which we had entered. Of course, we were all praying to God that the man-hole hadn't been re-sealed, as it was impossible to tell until you reached the ladder itself. Thankfully the exit route was clear, and we promptly dashed as far away as our legs could carry us.

I'm sure this ending comes as a disappointment to some of you reading this, as we (luckily) never bumped into the twisted individual who sits in that chair, but I must stress how radically out of the norm this was given where I live. The reason I mentioned the population earlier was with purpose; there is easily enough people here to escape the realms of 'crazy country folk', yet nowhere near enough people to have someone clearly lose grip on society without somebody taking notice. For example, there was literally only one homeless man, who everyone in the area knew and grew fond of, eventually resulting in a mass gathering at his funeral when he passed away. 

I sometimes think, though not recently as I had more-or-less forgotten about that night entirely, about the person who climbs down into that bridge and navigates through the darkness to sit facing a wall, and do God-knows-what, that ends up with a condom full of blood. You honestly couldn't envision a more surreal situation. 

It has just come to my realisation that what we unearthed that night has not once been uttered to another soul. As a naive teenager, it was the type of thing you just wanted to forget, but thinking about we probably should have let the Police, or at least *someone* know about what was down there, because it wasn't the doings of a healthy-minded individual.

So, there you have it. Apologies for the length, I got a little carried away as it is my first LNM post and I wanted to make the reading experience as similar to the reality as I could. Now I'm a few years older, and hopefully a bit braver, I'm considering going down there again, accompanied of course, to see what fucked up shit might be waiting. This could well happen in the next couple days, and rest assured I will 100% post an update as I currently have no job, so time is plentiful! 

Thanks for reading.  

**EDIT**: As promised, [here](http://imgur.com/a/aaiw2) are the photos from the return visit. We went early evening, so there was still plenty of light, and as a result I have decided to use a simple filter on most of the outdoor shots, simply to reduce the light, and give it the eeriness it deserves. 

*Unfortunately*, I hadn't adequately conveyed my plans to those accompanying me, and they had presumed I just wanted to check out the small area before the entrance to the passageways, as they had been there before. When I expressed my wishes to navigate through the bridge, they instantly nope'd the fuck out of there! As you can imagine, I was massively disappointed. I hope to go back soon with a different bunch of guys, but I can't promise when. 

Perhaps, if everyone who would like to see the re-return visit, just leaves a single comment saying 'Update', I could reply to you individually so you don't have to keep checking back, just wait for a message? Just a thought.

Either way, the pictures are definitely worth your time! Thanks again guys :)

1372788836.0	1hifly	How my mother saved my fathers life, or the meeting with The Kansas City Butcher	mollybiscotty	707	97	64	"My father was a handsome young 20-something living in a half sketchy half artsy area of Westport, KC with my mother, and they were newly weds expecting their first child, my older brother, within a month. This was the mid 1980's. At the time my father was into the whole Robert Smith kind of look- longish dark hair, piercings, etc. and kind of had a sensitive or feminine look going on. He had been mistaken as gay before because of his look (not to stereotype my own people, but you know what I mean here). This is important in a bit. 
 

Anyway, my parents had been shopping around westport on a street full of little boutique style shops. My mother stepped into a shop to look around and my father waited outside smoking a cigarette. He said a man came out of an adjacent store and struck up a conversation with him. The man was polite and friendly but as the conversation continued he became increasingly personal with his line of questions (where do you live? do you want to come over?) etc. My father was young and dumb and too trusting having grown up in a very small kansas town and being newly transplanted to this large city, but still this man began to strike my dad as odd. 


Just as it was getting weird, my mother came out of the store, came up behind my father and looped her arm through his. Like I said, my mother was heavily pregnant at this point. As soon as the other man saw my mother do this he stopped what he was saying, mid sentence, turned around and walked back into the adjacent store without a word. They both thought it was odd but frankly my dad was glad to be away from the man. They continued on shopping and went home.


That man ended up being The Kansas City Butcher, or Robert Berdella, an active serial killer in the Kansas City/Westport area. His MO was to lure gay men into his home, rape and torture them, then kill them. He was caught a few weeks after his encounter with my father when a victim escaped his home, fleeing down the street in only a dog collar. More information [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Berdella). My father highly suspects that Bob Berdella was scoping him out as a potential victim and upon seeing my pregnant mother realized he wasn't gay. Oh, and the shop he came out of? That was HIS shop, Bob's Bizarre Bazaar, a oddities shop that displayed the skull of one of his victims in the window. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1362100139.0	19flmc	When the parents are away	the_emerald_city	692	89	41	"When I was about 4 years old I lived in upstate New York with my family. At that time, my family consisted of my mom, dad, four older sisters and a very small dog. I remember that my parents very rarely had the chance to go out for the night, but this particular evening was an exception. 


My eldest sister was 15 at the time and was therefore capable of watching the rest of us for a few hours. My parents left for a short dinner and movie, giving us each a kiss before they left and with instructions for my sisters not to open the door for anyone. The emergency numbers were by the phone and the doors were to remain locked since my parents had the keys. 


Shortly after they left, my four year old self fell ""ill"". More than likely I was just missing my parents as I was the baby and spent all day, everyday with my mother. My sisters laid me on the couch and warmed up some milk with honey in it. They thought it would help because of something they saw on tv I guess. It tasted awful and made me sick for real. Then as we all laid on or in front of the couch watching the old My Little Pony, a knocking began at the door. 


My eldest sister called out, asking who it was while our dog yapped incessantly at the door. They said it was the pizza delivery guy. My other sisters were excited, thinking my parents had ordered pizza for us while they were out. My eldest sister wasn't so sure. She asked what name the pizza was ordered under. The guy told her he just had an address. My sister didn't believe him and told him that we didn't order any pizza and to go away. The guy kicked at our front door and told her to take the damn pizza.


My sister told him to leave and that she was calling the cops. She quickly grabbed the cordless phone and forced the rest of us and the dog into the bathroom since it was the only room with no windows and a lock. Each sister had a ""weapon"" of some sort; a wiffle ball bat, a heavy work boot, a fireplace poker, and a large knife from the kitchen. We all piled into the bath tub, kind of like they sit in the tub while training in the movie Cool Runnings. My eldest sister grabbed blankets from the bathroom closet and tucked us in. And...that is where my four year old self fell asleep. 


My sisters and parents have told me the rest over the years. My eldest sister called the neighbors who were our friends. They lived a few blocks away as we were set out in the country a little ways. But we found out later that they were out for the night and no help to us. My sisters could hear banging and the doors rattling as the person or persons tried to get in from multiple areas. This was before everyone had cellphones, so my parents couldn't be reached directly. Thankfully my parents happened to call to check in about ten minutes after this all started, and made the 20 minute drive home in about five. In those fifteen or twenty minutes, the banging and rattling was incessant. My parents came home with the police right behind them and they did a thorough search of the surrounding area. Damage to our doors and window frames were found all around the outside of first floor of the house and a couple empty pizza boxes were abandoned on the front porch. 


They never found out who did it, or why. But I shudder to think what their intentions were. I'm just happy nothing more came of it, and that I was too young to grasp the full implications of what transpired. They must have been inexperienced burglars/kidnappers/rapists..whatever they were, since they couldn't get in during that 15-20 minute window, but the fear they inspired was very real. I know it haunted my sisters and greatly influenced their actions for years after.

1375309106.0	1jgapc	Trust your overwhelming gut feelings...	lollydot	698	94	74	"I am female. This incident happened when I was in college; I was 20. I lived in a big city where I went to school but I still used my car more than public transportation since I needed to transport a lot of materials back and forth from my apartment to campus (sculpture major.)

 One weeknight I had been working late in the studio and decided to stop at the 24hour drugstore chain on my drive home to pick up a few things (tampons and chocolate.) It was pretty late, probably 2am, so there wasn't any other customers in the store but there were two male cashiers around my age. 

After I had been there about three minutes, a new customer entered the store. He was male, late 30's, kinda jittery looking. He noticed me and started following me around the store in a really obvious way. I was trying to ignore him, get my stuff and get out of there. He came up to me and started doing this ""psst"" noise like he was trying to discreetly get my attention. I kept ignoring him. Then he said ""fuck you bitch"" and left the store. I figured, whatever... Weirdo. 

As I paid for my stuff I had this overwhelming gut feeling to ask the cashier if he wouldn't mind walking me out to my car since that jittery guy had creeped me out. The cashier said it was cool and we make our way out to the parking lot. So I'm feeling more at ease about half way to my car and I turn to say thanks to the cashier for his help when he grabs my shoulder and says, ""that guy is under your car."" 

Sure enough, that fucking jittery guy was UNDER my car. The cashier shouts ""what the fuck are you doing, I'm calling the police!"" The jittery guy starts scrambling out from under my car and cashier guy and me run back in the store and he immediately calls the cops. It scared me pretty good. He ran away before the cops got there. 

I sometimes wonder what he would have done to me if I hadn't asked the cashier to walk me out. Grabbed my foot? Stabbed me with something? Just let me run over him?"	t5_2t3t8	True
1374606843.0	1iwiue	RE: My sister claimed someone comes into her house in the middle of the night.	AnonymousPanda_	705	107	115	"I have known for a while that my brother put this whole thing on Reddit, and if I'm honest, I wasn't happy he had done so. Reading the comments left by all you redditors changed my mind though and after much arm twisting from a certain someone, I'm going to give my version of the story. 


About 8 months ago I finally moved out of my mom's house and got my own place. For the first few months, It was fine, in fact It was great!

3 months after I moved in I started getting phone calls and even flowers from an unknown person. I didn't really think anything of it at first. Gradually I started to notice things going missing from my kitchen and living room, I would sometimes unplug the TV before going to bed and it would be on in the morning. 

I started going to bed earlier out of fear and I didn't go downstairs until the morning, my bedroom started to feel like a prison. 
My brother mentioned the 'sky box incident' in his post which was the breaking point for me. I had an AV transmitter (something like that anyway) installed so i could watch cable in my bedroom, One night I turned it on to see someone flicking through channels and I freaked the fuck out. This incident made me go to my brother a few days later at a party. 


When I told him he looked at me like I was crazy and said I was being paranoid. Eventually he started to take me seriously and offered to stay at my house for a few nights on the condition our younger brother could tag along, reluctantly I said yes (He's 17).  In the 4 days they stayed not one phone call and no one came into the house. I found this to be even more worrying, either the guy had given up or had been watching my house. Creepy shit either way. 


A couple days later he turned up again and this time I was frantic as I could hear him walking around the house and watching TV. I started to worry he was going to come up stairs so I called my brother and told him to get the hell over here. I stood by the window of my bedroom watching out for his car. 
My younger brother (Who should not have been involved in this at all) pulled up first and stayed in his car until my other brother arrived. When he did they jumped over the fence that leads to an alley to the right of the house, all whilst staying on the line with me. 


When they got to the kitchen window, he went quiet for a second and said something like ""Alright, He's in your living room, don't move and stay in your room."". To actually hear my brother saying he could see him terrified me, a part of me wanted to believe that I was crazy.


So, my brother explained that he needed to hang up to call the cops. I literally begged him not to hang up, I could tell he was freaked out as well though so I told him it was okay. The one thing my brother left out of the story was that he called me back on my mobile (Cell phone) which wasn't on silent and I'm certain it could have been heard downstairs. I hung it up as fast as I could and put my ear to the door. 
Around a minute later I heard the patio door (which sticks) opening, thinking it was safe I opened my door, when I did, I saw a man in a black trench coat with a baseball cap on walking up the stairs. I shut the door and pushed my wardrobe in front of it as quietly as I could.


Then I heard my brothers running up the steps. There was a struggle and I heard the man shout out ""I'm sorry, Please!"". I moved the wardrobe and saw my younger brother picking up a knife on the stairs.



That's about all I can tell you. I will say that the guy AKA my *ex* stepfather is not a bad person, he has suffered from mental problems all his life. His daughters haven't spoken to him in over a decade, after finding out it was him I felt terrible. I probably would have went down stairs to speak to him if i had known it was him. 


I'm sorry for any mistakes in the text, I wrote this on a tablet!, and thank you all again for the kind words!

If you want to know anything else, within reason, just ask and I'll do my best to answer you.

1343348546.0	x7y16	fake delivery guy	rosebleu	684	97	47	"My younger sibling has a couple of medical conditions requiring supplies, and my hometown has a pharmacy with a delivery service. We often got deliveries from them. When I was in middle school, my mom got a different job which meant that I would get home about 2 hours before everyone else, and I'd be in the house by myself. A few weeks after the start of school, right after I got home a guy rang the doorbell and said he was from the pharmacy. He had the uniform shirt on, and was holding a small bag with their logo on it. I started to unlock the door and went as far to take the deadbolt and the top lock off when I happened to think about the fact that the guy had sunglasses and a hat on, and jeans underneath the uniform shirt, whereas most of their drivers were very professional looking. I looked down at the street and saw that there wasn't one of their delivery cars anywhere. Plus the bag he had was really small, and the deliveries we usually got were a lot bigger. I told him to wait a minute and called my mom to ask if we were expecting a small delivery. She told me that we weren't expecting any delivery and to tell the guy that he must have the wrong house. I went back to the door and told him through the door I thought he had the wrong house, and he started insisting it was the right one, and he knew our last name. I asked him which person the medicine was for and he didn't know. I told him that we would just pick up the medicine at the pharmacy, and he started to get mad and say it didn't make any sense and that ""your parents are going to be mad at you if they don't get this delivery.""  At this point I was getting scared because he wasn't leaving.  Right after he said that, my uncle who lived nearby was coming up our stairs to pick up something. When the guy turned around and saw him he went down the stairs and said ""Wrong house!"" to my uncle and jumped in his car and left. My mom called the pharmacy when she got home and they didn't have any drivers who matched the guy's description or any deliveries scheduled for us, and the pharmacy manager was really disturbed because she said one of their workers had had his work shirt stolen out of his gym locker a few weeks before. I completely refused to be at home by myself for months after that, and it still creeps me out to think of how close I was to opening the door, and the fact that he knew our last name.

1375481793.0	1jlcs2	Terrorized for 2 Hours	MauraGrace	668	84	81	"This happened when I was in college. I lived in Isla Vista, the student community at UCSB, notorious for being a party school. It fully lived up to its reputation. I like to party, but holy shit! These people were off the wall. As such, there were a lot of people who put themselves in dangerous situations, drinking to excess, not being careful, not locking doors, etc. It had a very isolated and insular vibe, and anyone who was hanging around who wasn't college-aged immediately looked out of place and strange. 

One night after having a few drinks, I came home to my small house where I lived with 2 other girls, probably around 2:30am. We were all serious students (I was probably the least serious, actually), and when we partied it was not your typical UCSB mega-rager. More like a small get together with friends. We would often have a few people spend the night, sleep on our furniture our in our beds as the case may be. 

That night my roommates had had a few people over who I didn't know, and I saw when I returned home that one of them had opted to sleep on the couch from the shadow that I saw there (I didn't turn the light so I wouldn't wake anyone up). But as I was passing the couch to enter my bedroom, I noticed that the figure was lying very stiff. He just had this weird energy to him. He was lying down, but it was like he was putting all of his energy into lying as still and rigid as possible. I paused, and the guy quickly jerked his head to face me, without moving his limbs, so quickly that it startled me. I could see his wide open eyes glinting in the dark. 

Figuring that I'd startled him or that he was drunk or maybe on some kind of stimulant and unable to sleep, I just hurried past into my bedroom and locked the door. the dude made me nervous and I wasn't taking any chances. I fell asleep. 

At 4:30 am I woke up. There was a strange sound at the door almost like somebody was drumming their fingers against the wood very quietly. I lay still and listened. There were more quiet sounds like someone scratching the door with their fingers, which got louder and louder until it was clear that he was using both hands and scratching as fast and as hard as possible. It created an extremely loud and intimidating sound that filled me with fear.


I got my cell phone and texted my roommate because I was afraid to make a sound. ""Your friend is freaking me out, is he coked out? Can you talk to him? He's banging and scratching on my door."" 


She didn't text me back, probably because she was asleep. I texted my other roommate to the same effect, covering all my bases. Keep in mind that the scratching has been going on at this point for a couple minutes. I have no idea how he could have sustained it, scratching a wooden door with your fingernails can't feel good. He also grabbed at the knob and jiggled it super forcefully. 


Because neither of them answered, I decided to call and really wake them up, though i was scared to make a sound. I know it sounds stupid but there was something seriously horrifying about being teased like this through the door. I knew that he was trying to terrify me. i felt like a little kid but I could tell this guy was fucked up or something and maybe the police needed to be called, and I wanted to loop my roommates in since it was one of their friends. 


The scratching stopped abruptly and I called my roommate, who answered sleepily. ""Yo, your friend is messed up, can you please deal with it? Do we need to call the cops? He's seriously scaring me and he was scratching at my bedroom door, really fucking weird."" 


She didn't say anything for several seconds and when she did speak, her voice had no sleepiness in it at all. ""What friend?"" She said. ""That fucking guy that was sleeping on the couch!"" I said. She was quiet again. ""We didn't have any guys over,"" she said. ""Call the police."" My adrenaline surged and I told her to please lock the bedroom door as quickly as possible. I realized that I hadn't heard scratching in a while and I had no clue where the dude had gone.


Suddenly I heard a loud banging in the other end of the house, where my roommates, Lauren and Monica, shared a bedroom. The bangs were followed by the sound of them screaming in fear. I quickly dialed the police as this maniac proceeded to bang against the (luckily) locked bedroom door of my two roommates as they screamed. The heaviness of the blows left no doubt that he was trying to break the door down. 


I'd told the 911 operator the situation and she'd dispatched two squad cars. 

The police in Isla Vista are generally used to peeling drunks off the sidewalk and breaking up brawling frat bros. This was really serious and strange and I think the dispatcher got the sense from my tone how terrified I was, and she stayed on the phone with me. At one point the banging stopped and everything was quiet for a while. I talked with the dispatcher and suddenly looked down to see that this guy had slipped his fingers through the 1-inch gap between my door and the floor and was just kind of waggling them around, making this weird growling sound. I screamed and backed away, which is my biggest regret about this situation, since when I look back it would have been so awesome to just stomp the shit out of those fingers and hear the guy howl in pain. 

When the cops rolled up, I heard running and the sound of our sliding glass door opening and closing, and then he was gone. The cops never caught him. 

He had broken in through our side door by jimmying the lock somehow. My door was covered in what turned out to be huge gauges he'd made using a pair of scissors, which he discarded on the ground before he left. 

What terrifies me most about this was that I walked right past him. I looked him right in the face. I realize now that he was not trying to sleep or on drugs, but was lying so stiff like that because he was hiding. He probably heard me open the door, and freaked out because he hadn't realized there was another girl living there, and tried to blend into the couch in the darkness.

1342759697.0	wuwyo	A bit of a misunderstanding	Swerfd	681	103	35	"I figured I ought to share this story from the perspective of the (accidental) creeper.

 I'll preface it by giving a quick description of myself. I'm about 6'2"", lanky, long-haired, and ginger. I run semi-frequently but I don't like getting up early nor do I like running when it's hot, so I usually end up running late at night. I also happen to look like an utter madman while I run. Usually I'll throw on some sweatpants and a shitty old T-shirt, and my usually perfectly coifed ginger mane morphs into a sort of sweaty, sketchy mullet. I also turn a deep, deep shade of red. 

This particular night it just so happens that I was running a bit later than usual, around 1:00ish (I have odd sleeping patterns). I'd been trying to push myself a little further, so after passing my usual route I decided to take the long way back to my house down a couple meandering residential streets. On one such street I started cramping really badly, and slowed to a walk for a bit. Just as my breathing came back to a regular rate, a woman in maybe her late 50s turned from another street onto the same street as me, about 25 metres away.

I'm not really paying much attention but I see her cross the street shooting furtive looks in my direction. As she reaches the other side, I finish counting and begin running again, and, without thinking, cross the street so I can turn from there back towards my house. She immediately JUMPS into some kind of defense stance, yelling something like,""What the FUCK!?! Get AWAY!!"" I realize I've done something wrong and that she's mistaken me for some kind of rake. I try to think of a way to explain the misunderstanding and express the humour in the ridiculousness of the situation. Unfortunately, this comes out as a sort of semi-maniacal, hoarse laugh. She appeared to be reaching into her hand-bag. At this point I decided to cut my losses and ran in the other direction, taking a different route home. 

TL:DR I wanted to steal a woman's soul but she showed too much chutzpah so I cackled and ran."	t5_2t3t8	True
1353975553.0	13ucir	Me and my friends found a little dead boy inside a suitcase in a pond	Isho	689	118	80	"Hi guys! First time posting on /r/letsnotmeet. I have a horrific story from 5 years ago that I would like to share with you guys.

The year was 2007 and Me and my friends were in the 9th grade and were hypnotized by Runescape (it's a massive online multiplayer rpg game for those who don't know). We were mostly found playing Runescape and talking about Runescape or doing things related to Runescape during our free time. 

One day, towards mid-October in 2007, we were all near a pond near our houses (about 2km away, which is about 1.2 miles) talking and doing things Runescape related after school (Doing those stupid animated dances, talking about character levels, quests, etc) when we noticed a suitcase floating towards the edge of the pond. The pond that I'm talking about was actually a big duck pond. It was filthy. It obviously had ducks and other wildlife, but it also contained murky water and other crap. It wasn't unusual to find weird shit there.

Being curious little boys, we grabbed a stick and pulled it over to see what was inside. What was inside has scarred all us of for life. Inside, laid a little dead boy wrapped in a plastic bag in a curled position. Soon as we saw it, we immediately SPRINTED away and ended up vomiting all over the place.

We had no idea what to do. We didn't even know if the body was real or not. There was no way in hell someone would just dump a fucking kid's body in the pond in a suitcase. We were also scared that we would be held responsible for the death (we were young and stupid...). After deliberating for a while, we ended up running over to one of the random houses near the pond and told the adults there about the situation. The guy called the cops, and soon enough there were about 5 police vehicles there. At the end of the day, this had increased to about 15 police vehicles with 10s and 20s of media vans from all the major media sources in Sydney. It gained national media coverage for a few days and a manhunt had begun for the killer. Tributes were held everyday for a few weeks with thousands of people coming everyday to place candles, flowers and lights all around the pond.

The police were looking for a few statements from us, but most of us distanced ourselves away from the police and media (due to advice from our high school and parents) but 2 of my friends provided information of what had happened.

They eventually found out that the kid was a 2 year old kid and had been murdered by his mother. Now get this.... The kid was actually a nephew of a kid in OUR grade. The killer was his sister and the victim was his own nephew. The family had known to be junkies and the kid in our grade was pretty much torn apart at school (he was a bully). I never did say much to him, but I ended up feeling sorry for him.

I still have the guy on my facebook and we say our hi's and hello's every few years. This particular incident probably changed him for the best (I shouldn't be saying this but he was heading down the path with drugs and alcohol at that young age). He's a nice guy now and is currently enrolled in the Australian army.

The scary thing is, although he was a 'bully', he still hung around with our big group of friends. He used to always invite us over to his house but we always rejected his invitation. Scary to think what would have possibly happened if we had accepted that invitation and gone to his house where his sister was....

Anyways, my mother was a prestigious doctor who owned her own practice, and one thing I can say about her is that she had a heart of gold. Unfortunately, this would be her downfall. I remember it was years and years ago she met a homeless man, who she knew had a type of schizophrenia. However, my father (who is also a doctor) and her decided it was in remission, and trying to be good people, they let him live in the basement of her practice. He would do odd jobs for her, and she would pay him for his work. I remember during those times, my entire family loved that man. He seemed so nice and funny, and anytime he saw me or anyone else in my family, his face would light up. He always commented on how pretty I was, and how much I looked like my mother. He even came to our house for Christmas one year. Things were going great for a while, but of course, I already mentioned that this story doesn’t have a happy ending. Maybe about two and a half years ago, he started to get really odd. My mom knew that his schizophrenia was kicking back in, but he wasn’t doing anything harmful. He would just say things about how warlocks were out to get him, and how the government wanted him. Just odd things like that. Well, that started to get worse, and he turned to my mother for comfort. This is where it gets really bad. My mother’s kindness and good heart, turned out creating a sick darkness in this guy. This man started growing an obsession with my mother. He would talk all the time about how she should marry him, and how she should leave my father. Needless to say, my mom didn’t like this, and she kicked him out. He had her phone number though, and would leave her messages, telling her how much he loved her, and how she needed to get rid of her husband, or else he would. He even showed up to my father’s office, threatening he had a gun, but my dad quickly scared him off. Well, this continued for two years or so, and my mother went to the police multiple times, but they could do nothing about it. I wish I could describe the voicemails he left for my mother. They were just so weird. He would just sit on the phone, and breathe, and then say something about how he painted her a picture, and then he would hang up. He would call her multiple times in a day. Well, after about two years of all this happening, one day, my mother strode out of the office, she was the last one working. She got in her car, put it in reverse, and the man showed up. He shot her multiple times in the neck and chest, killing her. None of us expected this to happen. We knew he was crazy, but we didn’t think he was this crazy. What’s even creepier is after he was arrested, they found two tattoos on him, both of my mother, and he had a portrait commissioned of her. I know it isn’t a super creepy story, but I for some reason felt like putting it down on here. Huh. Anyways, thanks for reading.

TL;DR: Trying to be a nice person, my mother let a homeless person into our lives. He killed her, and he ended up being super creepy.

*Edit* I really do thank the many of you who have offered your sympathies. This hasn't been an easy time to get through for myself. Also, I've learned a lot of things from all of you redditors. I understand there are some disagreements, and I'm sad to say I don't have a lot of the answers. I'm quite confused myself about the situation. Also, as to posting the legitimacy of the story, I did in one of the comments, however before hand, I didn't want to because I was afraid it would affect the trial in some sort of way. I bent to pressure. The trial will be held in January."	t5_2t3t8	True
1362224705.0	19iouc	The Best Dog Ever	ShiningBrightness	633	96	129	"I suppose since I’ve been reading here and enjoying all the stories it’s now my turn to share something. This story will be somewhat two fold as it revolves around my dog, Toker (I didn’t name her).

Toker was a pitbull/rotwieler mix and was the best dog I’ve ever had. We adopted her when she was already an adult. It never occurred to me that she was a pitbull because she was just the sweetest, smartest, most loving dog. She hated cats but was fine with our cats. I had adopted a cat that came from a multi-dog household and they took to each other and were best friends. 

She wouldn’t leave the front yard without permission and on the whole was a very, very well trained dog. What always baffled me was that when I would take her for walks, people would cross the street to get away from her. Since I knew her nature it never occurred to me how fierce she looked.

During the summer I didn’t have anything to do. I had no obligations and I was bored. There was no such thing as the Internet at the time and television bored me so I spent the predominant amount of my time reading. I would fall asleep reading, wake up the next morning/afternoon to the sound of the snow cone truck and begin reading again. This was my pattern for most of the summer.

My bedroom was at the front of the house. It was a bright pepto pink and my curtains were sheer and white. My bedroom light was on most of the night as I was constantly reading.

One night I woke up to the sound of someone pounding on the front door drunkenly slurring, “Hey man. Get up. You need to give me a ride.” Toker who I’d never seen so much as bare her teeth to someone had gone completely unhinged. Her hackles were up, her teeth were barred, and she was barking and growling as she stood in front of the door.

My mom went to the door, didn’t open it and told the man, “No. You have the wrong house. You need to leave.”

“Let me in,” The man ordered and kicked at the door. Toker set off to barking again. She was just begging for my mother to open the door so she could tear that man apart. 

My mom told the man. “I have a vicious dog here begging to tear you apart. You don’t want me to open the door. You better leave.”

There was silence and more silence and then we looked out the curtains to see the man stumbling down the street. We’d already called the police and they picked him up and he had told them that he’d been watching me through my bedroom window.  

I got new curtains and slept with Toker in the room with me after that.

Toker’s protective instincts had been really triggered that night. A few months later I was walking her when a man stepped out of his drive way and blocked me on the sidewalk. 

“What a nice dog you have there,” he told me. Immediately Toker’s hackles rose and she started growling. She’d never acted this way when meeting people. I knew the man was up to no good and was about to step around him when he put his hand on my arm.  Man, I thought Toker was going to rip his arms off. She growled, lunged forward and pushed the man back.  He never approached me again. 

Toker died at the age of 13, she had to be euthanized because her kidneys were failing. I was thankful to have her in my life during my teen years to protect me. She was the best dog ever."	t5_2t3t8	True
1369845213.0	1f9yro	Can you call off your dogs?	bruyere	631	97	60	"The summer that I turned 7, I had a best friend, M, who lived in the middle of nowhere, on a big plot of land. Her mother grew up in Germany, but moved to the US in her 20s. She bred German shepherds. I spent a lot of time at their house as a child.

Occasionally, M's mom would leave us alone at the house while she ran errands, with their three adult dogs running around outside, guarding the fenced-in yard. We would usually just watch TV or play with Barbies until she got back.

One day, we were outside, playing in the yard, when a car drove very slowly past us. It sped up after passing the house. A little while later, M's mom had to go to town to return some library books or something, and she was taking M's little sister, but leaving us at home.

I'm not sure how long we were alone before the phone rang, but I answered, even though it wasn't my house, because M was painfully shy as a child and refused to talk to anyone but close friends and relatives on the phone. 

An unfamiliar man answered, and said, ""Hello? I'm the electrician your mom hired. I have to come inside. Can you call off your dogs? Chain them up?""

I panicked a little, because something about this man made me uneasy, and M's mom hadn't said anything to us about someone coming to work on the house. Plus, this was before the days of cell phones. How did he know about the dogs? I guess he could have had a car phone, but there were no vehicles parked outside the gate, and the dogs weren't even barking.

When M's mom returned, she confirmed that she had not hired anyone to come out to the property. None of us have any idea who he was or how he got the phone number, but he never called back."	t5_2t3t8	True
1375456852.0	1jkgoh	The problem with yoga books	thedoors111	596	72	62	"I am a 22 year old male, I live in a pretty weird part of Sydney, not overly dangerous but a lot of druggies and weirdos who can really creep you out late at night, which is when this took place of course. I'd just got off the train and started my 10 minute walk home, it was cold and it was late, almost midnight, so I was moving quick to get home. I was catching up to this guy who was dressed in a big bomber jacket and was singing to himself, I just figured he was another local odd ball, and kept walking along next to him wishing i'd remembered my headphones because his singing was shit.


Him and I walked along about a meter or two apart, and at some point a woman about my age came out of a side street carrying a bunch of books. We were all walking together in a nice awkward sort of situation as this guy sung, when suddenly he piped up and said to the girl in a creepy raspy voice ""Excuse me, but why are you carrying a book about Bikram Yoga?"" 
The girl responded politely that she was studying to be a yoga instructor, the guy stated he was in fact a yoga instructor, and they struck up a slow and slightly uncomfortable conversation. 


Initially I was just relieved he wasn't talking to me. I am not a 'tough guy' at all, and confrontations freak me out so I was glad I didn't have to speak to him. I kept walking just ahead of them though, and In listening to their conversation I did begin to notice that the guy seemed to know very little about yoga, and as they continued to talk, his questions got stranger, asking what she was up to, if she lived with friends or alone. I decided to walk a bit slower, so I stayed close to them in case anything went wrong or the guy tried anything. I had no idea what i'd do if push came to shove, I just felt it was the right thing to do.


So this all went on for another five minutes or so and I was getting close to my street. The girl was obviously uncomfortable and just wanted the conversation to end. I was almost at my corner, and feeling my job as a ""gentleman"" was done I decided to just take one look over my shoulder before I left them. I looked over my shoulder and stopped mid-stride. The guy was walking with the girl on his right, and in his left hand, obscured from her view, he was holding a knife. I stopped and stood there like an idiot. There was no one else around just us three now standing still, and the guy looked at me and shook his head, giving me a ""just walk away buddy"" kind of look, with anger in his eyes. Then I almost jumped when I heard a car horn, and I looked across the street to see a parked dark blue car with a man in driver's seat, he too was shaking his head at me, with that sort of look that said ""get out of here before something bad happens"". This was a joint effort, and thinking back I can remember car headlights following us for most of this, I just hadn't taken any note of it. It seems this was a joint effort by the two creepers


My heart was racing, and there I was standing in between this completely fucked up situation it seemed like I was the only thing preventing this rape/kidnapping or whatever from going down, and I with nothing resembling a weapon I felt very very useless indeed. Not a word had been said so far, and in my terror my mind flashed to something I once read about what you should do if you're attacked by a bear. I guess it was flight or fight and I picked fight, I raised my arms up to try to look bigger and starting screaming like an animal, I must have seemed completely deranged, but I got right up in the guy's face and I still don't know how this worked but it must have been so shocking that he just bolted, ran to the car and got in sped away, all of it happening in the space of 10 seconds or so. 


After that, we called the police, the girl thanked me profusely, but after all of this I couldn't even remember what the guy looked like, nor the number plate of the car. I just couldn't believe how fortunate it all was, I'd forgotten my headphones so i could hear the exchange, the fact I turned around for one last look, and that the whole screaming and waving my arms around actually worked. I shudder to think what could have happened to the young yoga student if everything didn't work out.

1375891315.0	1jw1yq	My first babysitting gig and the worst fear I've ever felt...	mav49	629	110	41	"I grew up in a really safe city in the Midwest, in an even safer neighborhood sort of set back in the woods and separated from the main part of town. I haven’t had a lot of creepy encounters in my short life (knock on wood), so this is pretty much the most afraid I’ve ever been.

I was 11 at the time, and had just passed a CPR/Babysitting Essentials course at the Rec. My neighborhood was very close-knit; all of the kids on my street played together, and because of my two younger brothers I would soon become the automatic babysitter for the three families we lived closest to. I’d looked after my brothers for short amounts of time, but this was my first job as a “real” babysitter, watching the two grade-school-aged children who lived across the street. They were family friends, the parents had promised they’d be home by 11pm, and I knew that my parents were home and ready to step in if I needed anything, so I was a little nervous but felt like I had things under control.


The kids were a novice babysitter’s dream; they’d been trained that they are only allowed to choose one treat each before bed, and actually refused my offer to let them finish the show we were watching because it was their bedtime and they still needed to brush their teeth first. I was floored, but it made my job super easy so I tucked them in and headed back downstairs to watch TV until their parents returned.


The mom is an interior designer, so their house is spacious and absolutely beautiful. Their living room is at the back of the house, with floor to ceiling windows and great views of the woods in their backyard. The couch is set up with its back to those windows, and I was watching TV with their elderly white lab, Alex. Out of the corner of my eye, I thought I saw something large and light-colored brush past the window behind me. I thought it might just be a deer, but I was eleven and alone and I have an active imagination, so I began to feel uneasy and pretty on edge. The parents weren’t due back for another two hours, so I walked into the kitchen to call my mom and dad for reassurance. Alex followed.


Their kitchen faces the living room, with the house phone on the counter (this was before cell phones happened). Standing at the counter dialing my parents, I had a clear view through the broad archway into the living room and out those enormous windows into the backyard. Alex laid down at my feet as I stood next to the counter and told my mom that I thought I’d seen something out the window. Hearing her voice was as comforting and reassuring as I thought it would be, so I told her that, no, I didn’t need Dad to come over, and that, yes, I’d call her if I needed anything at all.

I hung up the phone and sat down on the floor to rub Alex’s ears and belly for a few minutes, still kind of wary of the living room. I hadn't been there too long before I caught a glimpse of something odd outside those giant windows. I looked harder, past the glare of the TV, and noticed a tiny light bobbing around in the woods.  Probably just a neighbor, I thought. But as I watched, the light seemed to be moving in what was undeniably my direction.


My whole body froze and I stared as the light got closer and closer to the living room windows, and at some point I realized, with complete and paralyzing horror, that the light had grown large enough that the source had to be right outside the house. The beam swung from one side of the living room to the other, and then settled directly on my face.


I don’t even think I squinted in the bright light as it shone through the window into my eyes...I was too startled. Alex snoozed on, placid in his old age and entirely unaware that my heart had pretty much stopped beating. The light moved again, this time swinging away to illuminate a face from underneath. I saw dark, hollow eye sockets and the glowing curves of someone’s cheeks, but the face’s details were lost in the harsh angle of the flashlight’s beam. 


At this point I was trying with all my might to scream, or to move my fingers enough to dial 9-1-1, or to move out of view of the window…literally anything would have been better than sitting there with my mouth open and tears in my eyes like a stuffed turkey. But I’d never felt this kind of icy terror before, and was completely immobilized by it. Everything felt like it was moving in slow motion, and I was totally powerless.


The light swung around to point at me, then quickly moved back underneath the horrible face outside. It repeated this pattern once or twice, and then it suddenly disappeared. The flashlight had been turned off, and for whatever reason that was enough to finally let me move again. I quickly stood, and hit “DIAL,” about to call 9-1-1 as I mentally debated whether to hole up in the master bedroom with the children or just grab them and try to run out the front door to my parent’s house. The Rec class had not prepared me for this. Before I even got as far as the foyer and the first “1,” though, I heard a loud BOOM and felt my gut leap into my throat as I realized that I’d remembered close the main garage doors and lock the door from the garage to the laundry room, but couldn’t remember locking the man-door from the garage to their backyard.


I almost dropped the phone as someone began pounding on the interior door.


Through the pounding, though, I could hear a voice.

A really, *really* fucking familiar voice.

“Mav49…MAV49!! It’s DAD!!! Let me in!!!” I stumbled over, completely numb, and unlocked the door.


My dad could hardly stand up, he was laughing so hard. Apparently, my mom had sent him over anyway to check on me and make sure there was nothing to be afraid of. He’d done a quick sweep of the woods and backyard with a flashlight, under the assumption that Mom had mentioned he’d be coming over. He saw me through the window and attempted to show me it was him by pointing at me, and then shining the light on his face. UNDER his freaking face. He was unaware that the shadows made it impossible to tell who he was…until he saw the color drain from my face and realized he’d just given me the scare of my life. He thought it was pretty funny; I didn’t really agree. I know that the ending kind of makes this story inappropriate for LetsNotMeet, but up until I heard my dad’s voice I really thought I was about to get all kinds of murdered.

**TL;DR Babysitting for the first time and my dad almost gave me a heart attack.**

1371369626.0	1gg1mn	Let's Play!	Sssecretsss	593	73	52	"This happened when I was about 8. For reference, I'm female.
        
I grew up in an apartment complex with about 20 buildings, each around 25 floors high. Each floor had four apartments, which made about 2000 apartments in all. Each building had a car park underneath with an elevator and a flight of stairs that went from the car park to the roof. My apartment was on the fifth floor of an apartment building right in the middle of the complex. I used to take the bus home from school and it would drop me off at the corner across from the complex. I'd cross the road and walk home.
           
One day I had gotten off the bus and crossed the road when I saw that some neighbourhood kids had drawn a hopscotch on the footpath outside the complex. I loved hopscotch, so I dropped my bag and started playing. On my second go a lady, she looked like she was in her mid-twenties, came over and asked if she could play. I was a naturally shy little girl, but I was also very polite, especially to adults. I gave her my stone and let her have a go. Once she'd had a go she asked if her friends could play. Three guys, all in their mid to late-twenties came over.
               
This freaked me out. As I said, I was very shy, especially of males. I was aware that I was alone with them and I felt very uncomfortable. I told the lady that they could play, but I had to go home. She gave me a sad look and sad that she had hoped we would be good friends. I didn't want to hurt her feelings, but I was pretty scared, so I lied and told her I would take my school bag home and come right back.
                
I picked up my bag and hightailed it out of there. I got home and thought that would be the end of it. I was scared of getting in trouble from my parents for talking to strangers, so I didn't tell them.
                         
The next day the lady was waiting for me at the gates to the complex. She said that she was very sad that I hadn't come back and it had hurt her feelings. I said I was sorry, but that my Mum had made me do my homework. She asked if we could play now. I looked around and saw her friends waiting by a van. She said that they wanted to take me to have ice-cream at Kiki's. Kiki's was a new ice-cream place that had just opened. Each ice-cream came with a toy and all my friends at school had at least two toys each. We couldn't afford to go there, so I'd always felt left out. Now this lady was offering to take me!
                         
I knew I shouldn't go with her, so I said thank you, but I couldn't play today. She got really angry and said that I HAD to go with her. Being a timid kid, I hated being yelled at, so this freaked me right out and I started to cry. The lady immediately said she was sorry and gave me a hug. Then she tried to lead me to the van, saying an ice-cream would make it all better. I pulled away and started to run home.
            
This time, they followed me.
                           
I could hear them running after me and I knew they were faster than me, so I figured I'd hide from them. I flew into the underground car park of the building closest to the gate and hid between two cars. I heard them run down the ramp and stop. Then I heard the lady call out to me.
          
""Do you like hide-and-seek? Let's play! Ready? We're coming to get you!""
                   
I was shivering violently and knew that they'd find me here. I decided I'd get to the elevator shaft, take the elevator up to the top, then run down the stairs a few floors and take it back down, thinking that they'd see the elevator stop on the top floor and assume I was hiding there, so they'd search there while I got away.
                  
The elevator was on the other side of the car park, I had to go around two corners to get there. I crept along the wall, staying as low as I could until I was around the corner, then I bolted for the elevator.
          
The elevator was in a small room that had a huge door. I got inside, but didn't close the door all the way. I pressed the up button and watch as the elevator slowly descended, stopping at nearly every floor. I crept over to the door and peeked out through the crack to see where they were. I spotted them just as I heard the elevator *bing* from behind me. Without thinking, I closed the door.
                           
Now, as I said before, the door was huge, so it made a huge noise as it closed and even as I ran into the elevator I knew they'd know where I was. The elevator was full of people and I squeezed right to the back, hiding behind two boys and a girl who I'd seen around before. The girl lived in my building, but on a different floor. I watched the elevator doors closing, praying that they would hurry up. Just before they closed a hand shot between them and they opened again. The woman was there, looking furious.

""Get out here!"" she yelled.

An elderly woman asked what the matter was and the woman said I was her daughter and I'd run away. I was too scared to speak as the woman grabbed my arm and tried to drag me out.
                     
One of the boys sensed something was wrong and stopped her. He asked if I knew her and I shook my head and started to cry. The girl from my building picked me up while the boy told the woman to leave me alone. Since the elevator was full of people who now realised what was happening the woman and the guys disappeared.
                                                              
The girl from my building and the two guys walked me home and told my parents what had happened. The police were called and after some investigating (I wasn't told this until years later) found that the woman and the men were child traffickers. I'm so grateful that that boy realised something was off and stepped in. Who knows where I'd be if he hadn't.
            
Tl;dr: A woman tried to get me to ""play"" with her and some friends, chased me  and nearly caught me when a boy stepped in and saved me. Found out later they were child traffickers."	t5_2t3t8	True
1364259113.0	1b0f83	Stalked by seven men at the Supermercato.	annamal	599	79	58	"This takes place when I was studying abroad in Milan (I'm from Chicago, currently living in Milwaukee) around this time last year.  I was 21 at the time.  I'm female.

I was at the Pam supermercato (super market) buying my groceries for the week. I'm on the far right of a food aisle and I see a guy do a double-take to look at me from the other end of the aisle.  He mutters something and another guy walks beside him and starts staring at me as well.  I had grown used to men staring at me, so I thought little of this; I just kept walking to the next aisle.  I started inspecting some canned tuna, but could feel them watching me again.  I acted like I was turning around to inspect cans of tomatoes behind me, but I checked to see if they were there.  Not only where the two guys watching me, but now two more men had joined them.

I walked away again, this time shooting them a pissed-off look.  I heard them talking, but it was too quiet to understand; even if it was louder, my Italian is not the best and I probably wouldn't have understood them.  The four guys walked out of the store, each taking a moment to find me and look at me before they did.  Then they're gone.  I'm relieved.

About two minutes later, I'm going to check out and a man walks up to me and asks, ""Do you speak English?""  I said yes and asked if he needed any help.  He said no and tells me he's the store manager.  His English is not perfect, but he says, ""I wished to warn you that outside the store are, ah, six...no, SEVEN men, ah, yes, there are seven men outside waiting for you.  You should not go out there for some time.""

""Waiting for me?  How do you know they're waiting for me.""

He laughs nervously; embarrassed, ""Well, they are saying things about you.  They, ah, they are saying things they will do to you, and it...yes, the things they said, they talked of you, they described you, it is you.  They're waiting for you, do not go out.""

""What things did they say?""

""No, no, no, you do not want to know, no, no.  But do not go outside, they say they wait for you.""

I look out the front entrance and can see them across the street, looking at the front entrance, waiting.  There are seven of them, as the man said.  Some are pacing.  I feel like I'm being hunted.

I am freaked the fuck out.  I start looking through my phone contacts to see who could help me.  Before I figure that out, the man comes back a minute or two later and says that he found some police officers and told them of the situation.  When they started walking towards the seven men, they ended up running away.

I am so lucky this man warned me and helped me.  I have no idea what would have happened otherwise.  It's one of those things I think about less and less often, but when I do remember it, it scares me.

1369851817.0	1fa78x	Customer Encounter	daviannamorgan	576	74	61	"When I worked at the Adult Bookstore, I expected all sorts of crazies... but I never got a creeper until the end of my time there.

It was late night. The store was open 7 days a week. We weren't always 24 hours, though. Monday-Wednesday we closed at 2 am, and from Thursday-Sunday, it was a 24 hour store. This was Thursday night.

Now, my co-worker was my best friend. I got him the job, he took the overnight shifts on weekends while I took the second shifts during the week, and the first shift on weekends. He'd come in at midnight to relieve me, but I'd do his magazine counts for him.

I'm walking around the store, straightening out the magazines and counting them, when this guy creeps up next to me. I greet him as I'd greet any customer, with a smile and a ""Hello. How are you today?"" He smiled at me, said he was ""Fine."" and continued looking at the magazine rack I had just straightened up. 

I continue walking around the store, straightening shelves, when my phone vibrated in my pocket. My friend had texted me that the guy was intentionally following me around the store in a creepily obvious way.  I quickly went to the back and brought up the footage on the camera, and it was creepy, and it was obvious. I had been so intent on straightening the shelves that I hadn't noticed. He wasn't super close to me. He would stand in the adjacent aisles behind me, or way down the aisle away from me. I just thought he was working his way around the store, but as I watched the camera, I could notice him *staring* at me. 

I turned to the live feed, and he was talking to my friend. He got some change and went into the booth. My friend texted me again, saying that he had asked where I had gone, and that I needed to get out of the store and fast. He had only gotten a dollar for some quarters, which meant I had 4 minutes before he came out. The other problem was: He had his booth door cracked, and he had the one nearest the main door. He was literally watching the door as he watched his porn sample.

We thought fast. One of my regulars came in, a polite gay man, and my friend quickly and quietly filled him in on what was going on (my friend couldn't leave the register.) The Regular came to the backroom, and slipped out with me. We walked the full length around the store, through the door that wasn't open to the public (we could open it from the inside, but it had no handles on the outside.) It meant we had to walk around the unlit part of the store's lot, around the back, to get to my car.

The guy, I guess sensing something was wrong, didn't use his full four minutes. He came out to have a cigarette in the front of the store. Now, there was a ""privacy"" divider, which divided the front parking lot and the back parking lot. I usually parked in the front. The store had been full that night, so I had parked in the back. My regular and I were able to sneak me into my car (as I got in, he locked all the doors, and gestured for me to lock the driver's door.) When we were done, I waved at him, and sped off.

Not two minutes later, I received a text from my friend, ""He's following you. He threw down his cigarette, got in his car, and followed."" Sure enough, behind me, is a car. Following me. I took a few back roads (speeding heavily) just to check. Yep. I'm being followed....

So, I drove until I got to the police station, where I parked and sprinted from my car into the station. I worked at a convenience store that gave them free coffee as my then second job (after this and another incident, it became my only job) and the Sargent that would come get coffee from me was there. He escorted me home, driving behind me in his cruiser. He got out, walked me up the stairs, took my phone number, and made sure that I was locked safely in my apartment.

He sat in my darkened parking lot, with his lights off, for a good hour. He called and said he hadn't seen a single car pass, and that I should be safe. If I heard anything suspicious, I was to call 911.

Thankfully, I never saw the guy again.

**Edit:** I am a woman. I was 19 at the time. The guy was maybe late 20's or early 30's. He had at least 6 inches and 50 pounds on me.

**Edit 2: Let me give a description: He was at least 6 foot tall, with dark hair and dark eyes. He was thin but muscular, and he looked strong. This was NOT some little old man.**"	t5_2t3t8	True
1351759176.0	12g6xb	This is how easy it is for a crazy person to get into your house.	chimpwithalimp	581	77	50	"This won't be as creepy as most of the stories here, but its something that completely horrified me to my core when it happened. 

Back in my late teens in Dublin, Ireland, I used to head to a particular nightclub every single week and got to know most of the regulars there, to the point that I could sit at any table and know at least a few people. One night, I was introduced to a new woman that no-one really knew very well, and I said hello, made very short and polite conversation and then went about my time as normal, dancing and drinking. Nothing much of note happened during my time in the club.

At the end of the night, I left a little earlier than my friends because I lived really far away outside of the city. I got a taxi home (expensive!) and got into bed, falling into a deep sleep. 

I woke up in the morning, sunlight streaming into the room, and immediately knew something was wrong. Too much weight on the bed. I spun and looked down to the end of the room and there sat on the end of the bed was the woman from the night before, staring at me wide-eyed with utter devotion and a weird smile. It was totally fucking horrible. I had no idea what to say, so I said nothing. I was so weirded out by her expression and the whole bizarre nature of the situation, I was dumbstruck. It wasn't a lustful look - it was spooky, obsessive, insane looking.

I know for a lot of guys the idea of having some random woman appear in their bedroom might be a thrill, but this was nothing like that. It was scary, plain and simple. I got up, got dressed, summoned up a bit of courage, turned to her and said ""You're leaving. Now."" and essentially marched her out of the house, telling her that buses leave from the end of the road every half hour. She left without saying anything.

From talking to friends and family, I pieced together what had happened. After I left the nightclub, she had tried to catch me up but instead had lost me. She went back, asked around until someone told her the rough area I lived in, got a taxi there, knocked on random doors, waking up neighbours and eventually one told her exactly where I lived, and then lied to my sister saying that I had been expecting her. My sister was pissed off at being woke up, but let her in. From there she got to my room and sat there for god knows how long, silently watching me. As it turns out, almost nobody from the club knew her at all, but we all assumed someone else must know her.

What really spooks me is that if she had wanted to hurt me for whatever reason, she easily found her way right into my family house, right into my bedroom. Ugh, I'm shuddering thinking of it.

TL;DR Woman stalker found her way into my bedroom, silently, with little difficulty

When my now deceased grandmother (my mother's mother) was in her early thirties, she decided to drive to our town's convenience store after dark to pick up a couple things. She had finally just managed to get her four children to sleep and left my grandfather to take over while she hopped  in the car and made the 10 minute drive. Back then, the road from their house to the store had very few neighbors and was mostly just woods on either side of the two lanes. After buying the couple things she needed, she left the store and jumped back into her car, pulling out onto the road for her route home. 

A minute into the drive she routinely checks her rear view mirror. Instead of seeing the usual empty road or a set of headlights, reflecting back was a man's face in the back seat. Scared to death, she instantly hit the brakes (hard enough to shock this man, probably giving him whiplash), jumped out of the car and began screaming loud enough so people near the store could hopefully hear. Having this man's plan foiled (whatever his plan entailed), he took this opportunity to escape the car and ran into the woods, out of sight. 

After getting back to the store and calling the police, my grandmother found a cloth covered in chloroform in the backseat."	t5_2t3t8	True

I went to high school with a guy, we'll say his name is Bob. Bob and I were never close but we sometimes hung out in the same circle- he was in band and I was in drama. Bob was always a little 'off'... I think he may have had a learning disability and maybe that resulted in him being socially awkward. Anyway, by sophomore year he was dating a friend of mine, so I saw more of him. By junior year he had dropped out and tried to get his GED. That was the last I heard of Bob, for a while at least.

Fast forward to the summer 2 years after graduating: Bob calls me up, out of the blue and asks me to go camping with him and a friend of his that I don't know. He says that he knows a spot that is totally secluded and that we would be hiking 5 miles a day. He really tries to sell me on this. He insists that it'll be awesome and fun and that we'll bond. As I listen to him, something from the pit of my stomach says 'no. don't do this.' Never being especially close to him and not having seen him for 2 years, I thought that it was weird that Bob would call me up. I declined his offer.

The following November Bob is on the news because he had killed his partner- he worked for an armored van service- and stolen the money in the armored van. There were news updates about him fleeing out of the state. He was finally caught, on a routine traffic stop, I believe. Anyway, when his case went to trial, his journal was entered into evidence. The prosecutor said that Bob wrote that he and his friend (the same one that was going to go camping) hatched a plan to become professional assassins. I believe that the camping trip he invited me on was all a ruse so that he could get me in a secluded place so that he and his friend could practice how to murder someone- namely, me.

**TL;DR A classmate invites me on a camping trip to a secluded area.  I decline.  3 months later he murders someone.  It's discovered that he wanted to become a professional assassin when his journal is entered into evidence.  I think he wanted to lure me to a secluded area and kill me- for practice.**"	t5_2t3t8	True
1374695316.0	1iz71i	I don't scream for Ice Cream anymore	ZGdaOG	572	92	42	"Let me just preface this with the fact that this was the ONE TIME my parents let me stay home unsupervised for an entire day without a much older baby sitter. And so begins my story.....


It all started one hot, boring afternoon in the suburbs. I was spending the day with some of the neighborhood kids while our parents were at work. Although I was only 10 years old, my parents let me spend the day with the two girls that lived across the street because the oldest of the two sisters was 13. The other, my best friend Sarah at the time, was 9 years old. We were laying out on the trampoline, playing the ""What do you wanna do?""....""I dunno...what do YOU wanna do?"" game. Then we heard that exciting little jingle in the distance: The ice cream man! We all started scrambling out the door after the older sister (Tammy) who had the money.

We rushed down the street to the waiting ice cream man, joining the group of boys who were outside playing lacrosse at the time. As soon as we walked up and saw the driver, i got an eerie feeling. Something just seemed off about him. At first I thought I was just being paranoid considering he had a massively wretched scar down the side of his face, but he didn't stop smiling. It was a sinister type smile, coupled with an unrelenting gaze fixed right on us. We quickly bought our ice cream and bubble gum and left. 

As we were walking back towards our cul-de-sac, bossy Tammy ordered us to stop and sit on our neighbor's driveway and eat our ice cream. She said ""Look, I've heard stories on the news of these guys stealing kids, so lets just sit here on Ms. Day's driveway until he drives away."" Up until this point Tammy had a history of telling us bogus stories to try and scare us, so Sarah stared whining. On any other day I would have agreed with her, but I couldn't shake the nagging feeling that something was off. The ice cream truck then continued towards us, driving incredibly slow around our cul-de-sac. He was still smiling, and his eyes were still trained on the three of us. When he passed us, he even winked. 

As soon as he disappeared around the corner, we made a mad dash for Tammy and Sarah's house. We locked the doors, and then fled to her parent's bedroom. A few minutes go by, and we had all calmed down a bit, and had settled onto her parents bed to watch some terrible daytime TV like Jerry Springer or something. At that point, out of her parents window (that faces in towards the cul-de-sac on the second floor) we saw the ice cream truck stopped outside of Ms.Day's house. We didn't know how long he had been there, considering he didn't have the jingle playing. He wasn't parked there very long, and eventually slowly drove away. 

By this time, we are all hyperventilating. But before we could take a minute to recover, he drove by a third time. This time, however, we saw him get out of the truck in front of Ms. Day's house and walked up towards the front door, examining the outside of the house. He had a pad of paper out, and began to jot some things down. We all started panicking at this point, as Tammy yelled out ""HE'S WRITING DOWN THE ADDRESS!?"" He returned to the ice cream wagon, and as he started the turn the truck around he looked up and saw us in the window. We hit the floor like we were under fire, and watched him out of a side window. He stopped the truck right in front of Tammy and Sarah's house, and jotted more down on his pad of paper. 

As soon as he drove away that time, we saw our neighbor arrive home from work. In a complete frenzy, we ran over to her (knowing she worked at the police station) and told her what had happened. 

Ultimately, they found the guy, along with a notepad of descriptions of each one of us, the addresses of Ms. Day's house and Tammy and Sarah's house, as well as plans for when he was going to ""come back for us"". The guy was a registered child sex offender, with a warrant out for his arrest. I'm not sure how he got in that position to be selling ice cream to children in the first place, but he was.
So now every time I hear the Ice Cream Wagon jingle, I feel nauseous and unnerved.


tl;dr I was almost abducted by the ice cream man, who ended up being a creepy scar-faced child molester.

1371914776.0	1gux2t	Why my ex-girlfriend was terrified of underneath beds	noodlesfordaddy	567	85	94	"Reading through some of these stories here reminded me of a fun one I heard with one of my ex-girlfriends.

I don't remember exactly how it came up, but I think it was to do with her grabbing some stuff from under her bed one night - basically, she wouldn't do it and was terrified of it. I never understood why...until she told me.

Her cousins, who she adored, came home one night to find the house unlocked. They were really confused and frightened about why, so they checked the house, but couldn't find anything missing. They just assumed that they left the place unlocked.

That night, my ex's cousin was lying on her bed, doing whatever young girls do (oh god that sounds bad when I say it like that. No!), when her cat just would not shut up. It was lying on the floor of her room, hissing. Despite her appeals, the cat kept going, being very aggressive towards the underside of the bed she was lying on. She decided to see what the fuss was about, so she got down on her hands and knees, and looked.

There was a guy lying there, on his side, staring right into her eyes, holding up a mean-looking knife.

This girl obviously screamed like crazy and bolted out of her room, taking the cat with her. Her parents came running, she hysterically told them there was a man with a fucking knife under her bed. Her dad grabbed the door and threw it shut, locking the guy in there, while the police were called. As much as he tried to hold this guy inside the room, the guy ended up overpowering him and getting the door open and running as fast as he could out of the house.

Thankfully, no one was hurt, but the guy was never found.

Thankfully my bed is very low and couldn't fit anyone under it, yay!

EDIT: not sure why so many people are refuting this story. None of it is fantastical, and as I explained in another thread, if I was going to make it up, why the hell would I make it up around my ex-girlfriend's cousins? I would just say that it happened to me, or even my sister or something."	t5_2t3t8	True
1341876428.0	waq51	He came for me	Blueeyes1101	569	85	62	"So this story is about my mother. It was about 21 years ago when my mother was pregnant with a beautiful child (me). she was invited to a friends bridal shower in a really small town outside of where we lived. Mind you, were from Kentucky so when you travel in between small towns you take the creepy back roads. She said when she left it was about 11 pm. 

She was driving in her old Nissan sentra on a road that everyone calls death lane because so many crashes occur here. People like to speed around the hairpin turns like idiots. She was about halfway home when this truck kept riding her ass. She slowed down and pulled in the shoulder to let him pass on the one lane road. He slowed also as stared at her as he drove by. She shrugged and kept driving.

About a mile down the road she came upon the man, with his truck parked horizontally in the road. My mother stopped a ways back wondering what was up. Then she saw the man getting out of the truck and in his hand a large knife. My mom had nowhere to go with only ditches to the sides and no way to turn around. She decided to take the ditch and of course got stuck. The man walked towards her car. 

She was fumbling to get out when another truck arrives forcing her assailant to move his and leave. The other truck had a husband and wife in it and they ran to my mothers aide. They saved her life unbeknownst to them. When she arrived home she went straight to bed shaken by the nights events. 

The next day she woke up and went to watch some morning news. She gasped at what she saw. A pregnant woman was murdered last night, her baby cut out of her and taken. They caught the guy, he was parked holding the murdered child in his arms, rocking it. It was the same guy who came for my mom.

1347018955.0	zi32u	"""You can keep the change, Honey. Just come and take it."""	cuentadebasuramadrid	565	88	32	"I grew up in Whitefish, Montana, a very small skibum town in Northwest Montana, close to the Canadian border. We would sell lemonade and huckleberries on the side of the street in front of my house, which was set back about a hundred feet and surrounded by houses distributed sparsely through wooded areas. We had fun selling the lemonade despite the fact that there weren't a lot of people to whom we could sell it. It was just nice being outside when you're a kid during the three months it's actually sunny. Before the huge migration of the monied classes to the area, it was very Andy Griffith (in fact, actor Jim Nabors, the actor who played Gomer Pyle lived there, and I was even able to attend an event there and feed the fish in his trout ponds). So, there wasn't much worry about these types of things and we spent nearly every sunlit hour outside.

Well, as my friend and I were selling lemonade, an old green/rusty car slow down when they approached the stand. They then resumed the speed limit and continued on. That seemed odd, but the car had Washington state plates so we assumed they thought about asking us for directions since it wasn't unusual for people to get lost in the area. Maybe they thought twice about getting directions from 7 year olds. 

But, the car returned and did the same thing two more times. We weren't worried, but we certainly thought it was weird and were a little cautious. The car returned and stopped right next to the stand, with the passender side door the closest to me. I'm 4 feet from them, but 100 feet from my house. Although my house had a big bay window in the front and we did have a large grass yard, there was a line of trees between our stand and my lawn/house and there was limited visibility from the window (where my mother was home) and no visibility from any other houses.

I will never forget the woman in the passenger seat. She was really skinny with gray hair that had a yellow-tobacco hue from serious smoking. I didn't see the man driving that well because he was looking mostly in the driver's side mirror and only occasionally glanced at us. Their clothes were old and seemed dirty.

I said, ""hi... ?""

The woman responded, ""you must be pretty big boys to be out here selling lemonade all by yourselves.""

""My mom lets us.""

""Is she home?""

""Yes."" The woman looked at the man driving for a few seconds. I didn't hear or see any exchange of glances or words between them. She turned back and said, ""Ok, I'll have a lemonade."" 

I told her how much that would be in 1986 lemonade prices, which were probably 5-10 cents on the Spot Market of the Whitefish Lemonade Commodities Floor. She went into her purse. I could hear coins, but she immediately handed me a five dollar bill. I don't know why the other things weren't as disconcerting, because in all honesty, their appearance, their slowing down, the way the man wouldnt look at me, the question about my mom, none of those issues in isolation would be out of place. Or even a couple. But hearing the coins was the catalyst that precipitated fear. I responded: ""I don't have change.""

""You can keep the change honey, just come and take it"", looking at me and then glanced forward (the road is very straight and you can see if anyone is approaching for about half a mile either way).

I was a kid, and 5 dollars was a lot of money to a kid in a small town in the 80s. I thought they were weird and I was certainly anxious, but FIVE DOLLARS. I stepped up to the car, the man still not looking at me, continuing to stare in the driver's side mirror, i.e., the road behind him.

I make the few steps necessary to get sufficiently close to her hand so as to be able to reach the money, ala Michelangelo's Creation of Adam. Except the bitch quickly leaned out the window and grabbed my fucking wrist and started pulling me! I screamed my lungs out and my friend went running to my house screaming. The man started to lurch the car forward and the woman must have become unbalanced and, with my pulling away, I was free and ran the fast as I fucking could to my house where my friend was pounding on the door screaming. My mom got there quickly and we told her. The car was gone, but there was a five dollar bill on the ground.

I live in Southern California right next to a naval base, so I usually felt relatively safe going places by myself (I'm(f) a 5'2"" 105"" 24 year old). I walked to the beach that I normally go to which usually isn't packed and decide to lounge in the sunshine for a few hours before I start my day.

Well first off I hadn't slept well and the sun was making me incredibly tired so I thought I would just go home and take a nap after a half hour or so. Incorrect. I ended up falling asleep on the beach which is something I hadn't ever been able to do before. I woke up after about 45 minutes with a bug stuck in my hair. Immediate reaction? Swat the bug. However, what my hand hit was WAY to big to be any kind of insect so I craned my head back to see a homeless man petting...my...hair.

As I start to realize that Creeps Mcgee had been fondling my follicles I just stare at him for a second trying to register what is happening.

Me: stands up ""What are you doing?!""
CM: Reaches out to grab my hair again ""Your hair reminds me of my old golden retriever Sally""

Okay, between PETTING me and telling me I remind him of a dog he's not doing so great in getting my mood any better. Then I see the scissors...

shitshitshitshitshit

Him: ""Can I have some?""
Me: ""Of...?""
Him: ""YOUR HAIR!!  DON'T PLAY F*CKING DUMB BLONDIE!!!!! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to yell.""
Me: Terrified ""I'd rather not""

At this time one of the surfers yelled to a friend or something and it caught my attention. As I looked over to him Creeps reached up in a flash and snips off a small chunk of my hair. About a centimeter wide but about 10 inches long.

CM: Staring at my hair in his hand ""That will never work, I need it all"" 

The delightful chap then proceeds to switch the scissors from the proper scissor way, to a fist, the way you'd hold a knife.

This entire encounter I've been standing with my towel bunched up in front of me (didn't want to talk to him in a bikini) so I threw the towel over his face shoved him down and RAN. I ran at least six blocks zig zagging and hopped a fence at some random persons house and called the cops.

The police found him roaming another beach a few hours later. Someone called in saying there was a homeless man wandering around talking about ""Sally"" and he had a bracelet on made of blonde hair.

Fantastic.

I'd been to the city a couple times before, but the area was under construction so it was nearly impossible for me to find a bus stop. I eventually found my way to the building I needed and took my test. I failed, but they decided to let me in anyway as the books were in english and all my mistakes were stupid grammar ones that a lot of people made.

So I am walking along a street, grinning from ear to ear, when a man in his 30s walks up to me. He's black, has a heavy accent, and was at least 6'5"".

""I've seen you running here before,"" he says. ""I've always wanted to come talk to you.""

I was stunned and confused, but my overly polite upbringing kicked in and I told him he must be mistaken. I hadn't been here in years, and I don't run.

He was far too insistent, when I tried to walk past he would side-step and stand in front of me. At some point I had the horrible realization that I didn't actually know where I needed to go. The bus stop for the return trip wasn't where I thought it would be. And here is this guy refusing to believe I had never been here before, not letting me move more than a couple feet every few minutes.

At some point I saw a bus go by and decided I needed to be going that way. All the while he's trying to get information out of me, what I study, where I live, my name. When he sees I'm distracted by the bus he decided to try and grab my arm. In a blind panic I run as fast as I can (which, as you may have guessed, isn't that fast, I don't run) in the direction of the bus.

I find a bus stop and lucky for me a bus is pulling up. I jump in and sit down and let out a small sigh of relief.

Until I look up and see the guy again, buying a bus ticket, and coming to sit down in front of me. With a big grin on his face he continues talking to me. His questions and comments are getting steadily creepier. He's telling me I'm beautiful, he's going to marry me and we're going to have a lot of children and I won't even need to go to the silly university anymore.

I'm stunned and have no idea what to do. I can't shake the feeling that I need to keep calm and stay polite, even though all I want to do is scream at him to leave me alone.

The bus stops at the train station and I jump out. I head towards the trains moving at a fast pace but he's always one step behind me. I hear him say ""I'm not going to let you leave"" from behind me. I hear the whistle blow from the platform and I make a finally run for it.

I managed to jump through the train doors just as they were closing, and heard a thump on the window. I didn't want to look behind me, and as the train started moving I burst into tears of relief and went running for a train conductor.

I'm glad to have run into this forum, since I don't have anyone in real life to talk with this about.  It has been creeping me out and I'm afraid my boys will just laugh at me if I tell them.

Anyway, about a year ago I moved from Detroit to a small town in Mississippi for work.  I usually use my cell for phone calls, but I got a landline for dial-up internet, but for landline calls too.  I got an unlisted number on the landline and didn't give out my number to anyone.  I always give out my cell number to people who may need to call me.

One of my first nights in bed, my landline rang around midnight.  A female voice said in an emotionless monotone, ""Charlie.""  I replied, ""Yeah.""  She went on to say, ""Your booteyhole is your beautyhole.""  I chuckled and asked, ""Who is this?""  Before I got the question fully out of my mouth, she hung up on me.

Sometimes, I would leave my internet plugged in, but anytime I had my phone plugged in, I got those calls around midnight.  It happened one night while I was watching a ball game, so I know I wasn't just dreaming it.  She never would stay on long enough for me to talk with her, so I just started to leave my internet plugged in so she couldn't wake me up.  But each time was the same:   ""Charlie.  Your booteyhole is your beautyhole.""

One night a couple of months later, my cell battery had died, so I used my landline.  I forgot to plug my internet back in and around midnight my landline rang.  When I answered it, a man said, ""Charlie!""  I said, ""Yeah.""  He said, ""CHARLIE!!!""  Having been awoken from my sleep by this guy, I was pissed off and said, ""What's up nig?  Talk to me.""  He said, ""Your booteyhole is your BEAUTYHOLE!!!""  This guy had a really evil, demonic sounding voice.  Even though I know it was just a person, it was still creepy and it took me a while to fall back asleep.  

I don't know how these people know my name and unlisted number like that.  And why in the world would they be telling me that?  What is their motive?  Do they expect me to represent the state of Mississippi in the Black Man's Asshole Beauty Pageant or something?  

I made it a point to have my internet plugged in but I dropped my guard the other night.  I had my landline plugged in while charging my cell and the phone rang again around midnight.  Obviously these people must call every single night around the same time, every night, just waiting for me to slip and have my landline phone on.  The other night when it rang, I answered it ready to give homeboy a piece of my mind.  Except this time, it was a little kid.  The kid said, ""Charlie.""  And he sobbed as he said, ""Your booteyhole is your beautyhole.""  Then he hung up.

It's sick enough that grown ups would call me like that, but it's even worse to be getting kids involved.

I'm not going to plug my landline in anymore.  I never receive anything in the mail or get crazy calls on my cell.  But I don't understand why people would do this to me.  I don't know many people here and don't know how anyone got my number and knew my name.

I know it's not a creepy story, but I'm a big dude and this creeped me out.

1360829720.0	18i69i	I think my cat saved my life	lavenderKisses	533	83	36	"Here is some background info before I start the story. 

Six months ago I had gotten my first apartment. My mom and sister helped me move and the first week by my self was great! I was enjoying my freedom and independence and, becoming a real adult that can support herself. After I had gotten used to the place I was starting to feel a bit lonely.Coming home after school and work every night to an empty and quiet home was something I was not quite used to. 

Luckily for me my neighbors had a cat. He was (still is) a sweet and loving tabby cat that loved attention. The neighbors weren't very good pet owners though. They neglected the poor thing and hardly feed him, he was literally skin and bones!  So whenever the cat would come over to my place I would feed him whatever I had in the fridge. 

A few weeks passed since I moved in and the neighbors decided to move. It took 3 days in total for them to pack up their stuff and leave. I noticed a couple days after they left their cat was still there wondering around outside in the rain looking pathetic. I kept him with me for a couple days hoping that they would come back for him; they didn't. Once I knew for sure that they wouldn't come back I checked with my landlord to see if I could keep him.

After signing some papers and paying a pet deposit the cat was mine. I decided to name him Crybaby because he was very vocal about everything, especially for food. Crybaby had adjusted really well with his new life. He was gaining weight fast, and was even more affectionate with me.  With him around I didn't feel lonely in my home anymore.

Skip forward to two months. I was in my room sleeping, Crybaby woke me up meowing loudly in the living room. Still half asleep, I looked over to my alarm clock to see it was 4 am. What The *Fuck*?  He never did this before, at least not this early in the morning. Was he hungry?  Once I got out of bed and walked to the living room I became more alert. I didn't just hear my cat I also heard something else that made my stomach churn. Someone was was jimmying my locked front door as my cat watched.

For the longest time I couldn't move. I stood there in my living room paralyzed with fear. My thoughts raced and my heartbeat was loud in my ears. Sooner or later ,if this person was lucky, they would break into my apartment and do god knows what to me and /or steal everything of value. I had to something, anything to get person to leave. It took about a minute for me to collect my courage.I was about to do something reckless and possibly stupid.  I shakily walked to the door and moved my hand to the light switch next to it and turned on the outside light. This seemed to do the trick. Once the person knew I was home he proceeded to yell ""SON OF A BITCH! FUCK!"" After that outburst he kicked the door a couple times, which scared me even more and I  jumped back and fell on my ass. Then he stopped and everything went silent. 

Again, I became paralyzed with fear. What was he doing? Is he still here or did he leave? Oh my god what if he comes back? shitshitshitshitshitshit. I sat there for 10 minutes straining my ears for any other suspicious sounds. I was relived when I didn't hear anything else. Once I was in the right mind and not as panicked as I was earlier I called the cops. I then found out I wasn't the only person who almost had their apartment almost broken into. Four other tenants that lived in the same complex I did had experienced what I had went through as well. 

Sadly the cops never caught the guy. So he's still out there somewhere. And I hope to god that I **never** have to meet him. The one thing I am thankful for is that Crybaby is such a vocal cat and that he was able to wake me up that night. Weather that guy was able to break in or not, I really do think that my cat did save me that night. And I think that I will always triple check to see if my doors are locked at night before I go to bed for the rest of my life.

TL;DR My very vocal cat woke me up for me to find out that some guy was trying to break into my apartment. After that I found out that he tried to break into 4 other apartments as well.                          "	t5_2t3t8	True
1373556157.0	1i31s5	The creepiest compliment I've gotten from a woman.	Neutralfan	535	77	50	"Quite some time ago, when I was 16 and still active in the church, I had an encounter with an older woman. She was 26 and very attractive. She was also always there. I'd see her almost every time I turned around.

In church, eating dinner at a restaurant, driving on the highway; she was everywhere. 

For awhile I just passed it off as a weird coincidence. We lived in the same town, went to the same church, etc. But then one day she came up to me and told me it had to end. I was just too young for her. She was moving and wouldn't see me again.

We had never dated, never had any kind of relationship. I had been being stalked without knowing it and she had just decided it was over.

The strangest part though, was her final ""complement"" to me. I still remember the exact phrasing. ""You are so giving, I just want to unzip you and crawl inside and live there the rest of my life"".

So, creepy. But at the same time, a bit flattering."	t5_2t3t8	True
1340662964.0	vlgxb	Could time travel be a natural phenomenon?: My experience in Washington's Cascade Mountains.	JackSprat90	546	95	69	"I have always loved the outdoors. I was fortunate enough to be born in the great Pacific Northwest, the Western Washington Cascades to be exact. My father and I spent much of my early years of life exploring the mountains, fishing, and hunting. There are parts of the Cascades I know like the back of my hand. One of those places is called Goblin Creek up the Index-Galeema road off Highway 2. When I was a kid we would drive up there to do some fishing and shooting, but also to collect a specific type of rock that when cut in half and polished would resemble a scenic picture of the view of mountains from within a cave. I do not recall the true name of these stones, we just called them picture rocks. My fathers friend and neighbor owned an art gallery/mineral shop that used to be a church. If you have ever driven through Start-up on your way from Sultan to Goldbar on highway 2 you might remember seeing the robot sculpture outside the shop that my dad built. This is the place that we sold the stone for $2 a pound. It was lucrative revenue for a pre-teen.

The walk from the creek where we harvested these rocks to the dirt road wasn't particularly long, but lengthy enough that you could presumably get lost while en route if one didn't know where to go. In the years we spent at this creek I had only ever seen two other people out there. One was a game warden that heard the gunshots from our target practicing session and tracked us down to make sure everything was fine. The other is the subject of my curiosity.

When I was about 14 I distinctly remember hauling a backpack full of these rocks up from the creek to my dads truck. Along the way I ran into a man that looked to be about 30 years old. We both appeared to be surprised that we would run into anyone in this rather remote section of the mountains, but as I got closer to this man (he was heading down to the creek, I was heading up to the road) he seemed to grow increasingly more startled, as if he was seeing a ghost. He didn't say anything as I passed, he just stared at me seemingly trying figure out the appropriate words ask me something. After passing him I remember thinking how much this guy looked like he could be in my family, the similarities were striking. I continued on to the truck, dumped my load of rock off at the truck and headed back down to the river to my dad. When I arrived I told him about the encounter and asked him if he had seen this man to which he replied that he hadn't. I have remembered this encounter quite vividly since then.

Last year I was visiting my family in Snohomish and decided to head up to old Goblin Creek for nostalgic purposes. It had been about 15 years since I was last up there. Along the way up there I found out that the Index-Galeema road had apparently washed out years before, luckily I knew of another way up there via Jack Pass. I found the dirt road and parked where my dad used to park and proceeded to walk through the woods down to the creek. Along the way I saw something that absolutely shook me to the core. As I was about half way through the woods I was startled to see someone else coming up from the creek, a boy, about 14 years old. He was wearing a backpack that looked to be burdened by heavy weights. As we got closer, I began to get increasingly confused and shocked as the boy looked exactly like I did at his age. I meant to say something to him as he passed, but could not figure out the right words to express what I was thinking at the moment. He passed me and kept going. I walked a little ways and finally stopped when it all really hit me. I remembered the encounter from my teenage years and realized I had just lived the other half of the experience! Both the man and boy were me, roughly 15 years removed! I turned around to catch up to the boy in the thick Western Washington woods. I ran all the way back up to the road where my truck was to find...... nothing. There wasn't anywhere else besides the road for him to go to, and I hadn't stalled so long as to not be able to catch up to him. He was simply gone. Curiosity got the best of me so I hurried down to the creek half expecting to find my dad fishing on the bank 15 years younger but found nobody.

I ended up going home and deciding that this experience was too unbelievable to tell even my friends and family. I just wanted to get this out there to the wonderful Reddit community to see what others think and hopefully to see if anyone else has had this type of experience as well.

EDIT: I have posted this here and on r/nosleep and r/glitch in the matrix on suggestions from other members of reddit but nobody, including myself, can agree on the best place for it.

1370539308.0	1fsw4p	Haven't been camping since.	bearrwitness	511	66	74	"In May 2009 I had just broken up with my girlfriend of almost 3 years. We had moved from Calgary to Toronto, and were still stuck living together after the breakup as we didn't know many people in the city yet. Needless to say the situation was pretty stressful &amp; upsetting. So when a buddy I was going to school with at the time suggested a weekend camping/fishing trip, I jumped at the chance. 

He grew up in an area about an hour outside of Toronto called Flamborough. Its really beautiful. Loads of lush forest, farmers fields and small rivers &amp; creeks. We decided to camp and fish along a creek called Grindstone Creek. Its close to some wetlands and the fishing is supposed to be great. We ended up setting up our camp in what was probably a farmers field (I'm guessing it was trespassing on our part) bordered by a gorgeous forest. We spent the evening fishing, shooting the shit, and drinking some quality craft beers. As it got darker we made a little fire and roasted potatoes and hotdogs. All in all it was a really good night. 

We turned in just after midnight, we shared a tent. My buddy fell asleep before me &amp; I stayed up playing on my phone until probably around 1:30. I must have drifted off because the next thing I remember was being woken up by a high pitched yipping type noise. I was kind of groggy and it took me a moment to fully wake up. The yipping was incessant and it sounded like a weird coyote. I laid there for a moment listening and then started playing on my phone again, the noise was annoying as hell. I tried ignoring it but it sounded like it was getting closer. Finally it sounded like it had to be no more than 10ft from the tent. At this point I was getting a little unsettled. I had seen coyotes in Calgary before and I thought of them as pretty harmless. They never looked much bigger than a smallish dog. But what if this one was rabid or something. What if it could smell our food? I have a pretty bad anxiety disorder so I'm prone to worrying about these types of things.
 
I nudged my buddy to see if he was awake, and he was, the noise woke him up too. We discussed what to do about the coyote, as we hadn't brought anything to scare off critters. Not a bb gun, nothing. Finally he decided he would shine the flashlight on it, and holler a lot, hopefully scaring him off. 

He unzipped the tent and I watched him pointing the flashlight out into the darkness. I'll never forget what happened next. His legs suddenly went all wobbly and he sort of stumbled backwards into the tent. He had a really dumbfounded look on his face when he looked at me and babbled ""its not a coyote, its a dude, its some weird dude."" Normally I would have thought he was messing with me (I'm a huge wimp and scare easily, I won't even watch horror movies) but I've never seen someone look that scared. And i never want to see that expression on someones face again. So I knew he wasn't pulling my leg. The weird yipping and howling type noises were still going on and it retrospect..it really didn't sound like a coyote but I guess in our groggy states it was a way for our brains to make sense of it. Anyways he kept telling me just to look out the tent flap ""to make sure he's not crazy"". 

At this point I was having a full blown anxiety attack, my heart was RACING, I felt like shit, but I had to look. So I slowly peeked out the flap and waited for my eyes to adjust and thats when I saw him. He was standing only a few arms lengths away from the tent. He was swaying a little, and wearing a baseball cap...what made it awful though, what was really creepy, was that he was wearing women's lingerie. That's when I knew there was most likely something very wrong with this guy (if the making high pitched noises at a strangers tent in the middle of the night didn't give it away). After I pulled my head back inside the tent my buddy and I discussed what to do. Finally we decided to yell at the guy to fuck off. My buddy started yelling ""EXCUSE ME CAN YOU FUCK OFF?? WE'RE TRYING TO SLEEP IN HERE."" The noise stopped, it was dead silent and thats when we heard footsteps running towards are tent. They stopped right outside the tent but we didn't waste anytime, we started yelling again ""SERIOUSLY FUCK OFF. WE HAVE CELL PHONES IN HERE IF YOU DON'T FUCK OFF WE'RE GOING TO CALL THE COPS."" With that we heard him walk by the tent and head off, sounded like he was moving towards the road. Needless to tay we laid awake, petrified until the first sign of sunlight, then we high tailed it the hell out of there. 

We discussed our experience on the way home, and were both pretty embarrassed about how scared we got. It definitely was not manly on either of our parts. I think because we were both ashamed of how we let some weirdo freak us out so much, we really haven't ever talked about it since that day. So there you go! There's my weird story. I'll always wonder what the hell that guy was doing out there, or what was wrong with him. Sometimes I wonder if things would have turned out differently if we were a couple girls. I'm not saying he was some serial killer but..seemed like he was testing who was in the tent? Guess I'll never know! And for that I'm kind of glad.

1330927369.0	qi85y	9-Year-Old Corpse Party	VickyT	499	56	49	"This isn't too terribly interesting, but after reading some stories, I really wanted to tell mine. I'm 18 now, so it was 9 years ago when this happened.  
A girl named Delaney moved in next door to me the weekend after my 9th birthday, and I wanted to play with her like ALL the time. She was really sweet, kind, and smart, even though she was 2 years below me.
A few weeks after she moved in, her parents were out on vacation, so she slept at my house for a few days. And my dad bought us chalk to play with. Being creepy little girls, we made chalk bodies on the sidewalk in front of our houses. While she pretended to take forensic analysis, I pretended to jot down notes, because fuck yeah, CSI.   
A blue pick up went by. I decided it was going too fast, so I wrote down his plates. More fast cars went by, and I wrote down all their plates, along with the car type and color, because I was strange. I told Delaney that something seemed weird on my paper.   
She looked and said that the blue pickup was there like 5 times.   
We shrugged it off and carried on.   
We made so many chalk bodies it was insane.   
Minutes passed, and the blue pickup came around again, but slow. Really slow. I was scared, and told Delaney to go inside my house while I cleaned up. She didn't want to, but I bribed her with lemonade.   
I hosed down the sidewalk to clean the chalk and I picked up our things, and went inside.   
The next day, forgetting all about the incident, Delaney and I held a lemonade stand because we wanted earrings. We did fairly well, and for 20 cents for a dixie cup, we made about 30 bucks in one hot day. Before we packed up, a blue pickup truck came around. I was really scared, but my mom was with us like a good parent, so I held her hand and grabbed Delaney's dress. He walked up to us in a long brown coat and hat, even though it was like 90 or something. He smelled like smoke. Not cigarettes, but like paper was on fire.   
He bought 3 lemonades, and I will never forget this for as long as I live. He lifted up his gross ratty hat, looked me in the eye and said this:   
""It's a real good thing you cleaned up all that chalk, little sister. I wish it had been darker. I would've made my own corpse party out there.""   
He laughed and drove away.   
I had never been so terrified in my life. My mom doesn't remember it, and I don't talk to Delaney anymore.   
I will never forget that guy's words."	t5_2t3t8	True
1341074953.0	vuh0j	I almost wasn't born	ShakeandJake94	509	73	34	"Be forewarned, I've tried to find sources for this guy, but my search was in vain. 

So when my dad was roughly 9 or so, him and a couple of his cousins, the oldest 13, we're hanging out at a park in Massachusetts. It was summer and a hot day, and the year was 1968 I believe. As he and his cousins were trying to avoid the heat, a man meets them and introduces himself as Stanley Rice - a nice enough looking guy with a camera bag. They strike up conversation, and the heat comes up. Stanley mentions an old swimming hole he knows in a creek a little ways out of town, and offers to show them the way. Being naive children in the less-suspicious 60s, they agree, and set out for the creek. 

They walk and walk and walk, cross the train tracks a mile out of town, and walk another 20 minutes until the oldest cousin rejoins the group of kids.

For the majority of the trip, the oldest had been walking with Stanley and talking to him. As he saunters back to the group, still lazily following Stanley, he whispers to my dad, ""that bag has a totally different name on it. And he's got a pistol."" As this happens, they reach the swimming hole. They plan to break for it when Stanley gets in the water. Strangely enough, Stanley is already wearing swimming trunks as he strips his pants. He tells the boys to c'mon and join him as he dives in the water. 

They scatter and begin running as fast as they can back home. Having watched too many army shows, they start zigzagging back and forth as they hear Stanley cling out and grab the pistol. My dad looked back as the last thing he saw was Stanley Rice on one knee with a Luger pistol pointed at him, yelling his head off. 

So they all escaped, and none of them told their parents. 6 months later, Stanley Rice was arrested. Turns out he was an escaped mental patient whose MO was raping little boys and burying them in the sand of creek beds. Apparently when they caught him he'd already killed more than 10 I think, and had 2 kids captive, bound in a van. So that's one of the near death stories my dad has in which I almost wasn't born. 

TL;DR - My dad was almost killed by an insane serial child molester and murderer when he was a kid. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1372074093.0	1gyos4	Older man tried to lure me into his home on several occasions.	blasphemicassault	504	62	35	"This happened when I was about 14 years old, in my 9th year of school. I had to take city transit home, which was about a 10 minute ride, and then walk home from my stop, which was about five minutes. 

One day the bus was a little more full than usual, and this older man sat by me. If I had to guess his age, I'd say he was around 60. He tried to strike up what I thought was an innocent conversation such as ""are you all from the same school"" and ""is the bus normally this full?"". I answered thinking nothing of it, I was on *public* transit, what could go wrong? He suddenly started inching closer to me, slightly rubbing his leg against mine. He got off at my stop, and proceeded to walk one way while I went the other, and that was the end of that.. or so I thought. 

The next few days he was always on that bus. I had never seen him on that bus before. I thought maybe he was coming from work or something, I didn't know. One day I had to stay late for detention, and the next day he asked why I wasn't on the bus. I was a little creeped out. Then he asked me to come to his home for dinner. I politely refused. He would ask different questions over the next few days, all asking me over, and tried to offer me candy and baked goods a couple times. He even started walking in the direction I did when walking home to 'see where I was going' one day. After that, I told my parents  (I know, I know, I should have done it earlier). 

My Dad wanted to talk to this man, so he hung out at the bus stop on a Friday afternoon. He made it look like he was waiting for someone else, and told me to play along, so I did. I didn't acknowledge him when I got off the bus, and he saw for himself the actions unfold. The guy again asks me to come to his place and says he has a nice ""dinner planned for us"". I start walking in my direction when the man yells ""Don't you walk away from me, get back here!"" rather aggressivly, and starts trekking my way. That's when my Dad piped up and asked what the hell he was doing. The man replied with ""I'm getting my daughter to come home, but she won't listen to me!"". (You could tell I wasn't his daughter, given that I'm Caucasian and his skin was plenty darker) That's when my Dad lost it. He went on about the creepy things he's said to me, how HE is my father, and how the man better not come near me ever again. The man went pale and took off. My Dad phoned the police and they looked around and said they'd patrol the area. They never did catch him, and I never saw him again.

1374743507.0	1j0nc1	She's Mine.	QuietDestiny	502	67	68	"I've been lurking here for a while and I have so many creepy encounters, it's like I'm a creep magnet. This one is the most recent, so I thought I'd tell it first. For reference, I'm 19 and female.

I take care of my two nieces once a week for a full day. One of them is four and the other is two. They're both pretty as a picture with blonde hair and blue eyes and it's not uncommon for someone to comment on how cute they are, although usually they're female commenters. One day I took them both down to the park. We usually do this as the park is quiet, but not deserted, so it gives me some time to just sit while they play. This day in particular there were a few extra families there, since it was a pupil free day at school. I was keeping a close eye on the girls since I'm naturally cautious and this subreddit has gotten to me a bit (thank you for that!!).

The older girl (K) wanted to play on the swings while her sister (T) wanted to play on the slide on the other side of the park. Usually I would let them split up, but since there were a lot of people I wanted to keep them together. I told K that we would play on the slide first, know that T usually gets tired out after that. So we play on the slide for a while and sure enough, T got tired and wanted to sit with me for a while. I took a seat near the swings to watch K playing. T curled up on my lap and starts to doze.

As I'm sitting there a man approaches me, probably in his mid- to late-twenties. He seems pretty normal, tall, kinda cute, blonde, blue eyes, the whole package. He sits down next to me and asks if T is mine. I tell him she's my niece. He asks if K is mine and I tell him also my niece.

At this point I'm not getting any bad vibes. I'll admit I was checking him out a little. He tells me how beautiful the girls are ""Like little angels"" and I ask him if he has a kid here. He says he likes watching them. A red flag went off in my head. I thought maybe he's some kind of behaviorist or something, so I ask what he does for a living. He gives me this weird smile and doesn't answer, but says ""Nice to see you."" and walks away. I'm feeling really weirded out. The fact that he blocked both my questions made me uneasy, but I shrug it off and go to check on K.

I carry T towards the swings, looking for her blonde hair. I start to panic as I realise I can't see her. I don't want to freak T out, so I try to stay calm. I rush around to all the play things, calling for her, but she doesn't answer. This is unusual, since usually she checks up on me more than I do her. Thoroughly terrified now, I run up to a group of mothers and ask if they've seen her. One of them says that she saw two men with a little girl like that. She said one looked like her father.

I want to scream. While he distracted me someone else must have taken her. I literally burst into tears. I'm out of my mind with terror and T freaks out too. The women suddenly realise what's happened and one of them calls the police, while the others try to calm me down.

I'm going to say right now that I believe that someone or something was looking out for us that day. The police are there within minutes and then they're off searching. They find the guys just over a block away with the van's engine smoking like there's no tomorrow. They arrested them and bring K straight back to me. She's pretty upset, naturally, and doesn't want to be put down, which is fine, since there is no way that I would have let her go.

The investigation continued and it turns out that the blonde guy had lost a daughter who he was trying to replace in his life. We filed a restraining order and he's not allowed in our town unless it's to attend court. K is fine now and often gets frustrated that we're all so over protective of her and T. We were so unbelievably lucky.

So yeah, that's the most recent creep-moment that's happened. I might share some of my others soon. Sorry it was so long :P"	t5_2t3t8	True

SO I am walking home from smoking at my friends place from the bus stop to my house. I notice a guy in a black hoodie get off the same stop as me. I start walking up and notice he is tailing me and behind me by a few hundred feet, almost a block length. 

I keep walking towards the gate into the presidio, and keep looking back at this guy. His face is hidden in the black hood so i cannot make out who he is at all or what he looked like. but I can see he has something he is holding in his waistband, I think it was a knife, though i was unsue due to the distance.

I finally hit the gate and as i look back i see him turning into a house entrance. I breathed a sigh of relief and mocked myself for being so paranoid.

I took one look back over my shoulder to make sure...
He was staring around the doorway at me.

He began to follow me again when i reached the entrance to the woods, and picked up his pace.

After being in the woods by about a few hundred feet i decided i was going to confront him.

Full of adrenaline I turned under a streetlight and put a huge smile on, the creepiest I could and lifted my big-ass knife up and charged him screeching and screaming incoherently, more to get anyone to hear me and scare him. 

He panicked and started to reach for his knife, so i screamed louder and he took off running i kept yelling about wanting to eat him.

So I out crazyed a crazy. I still don't walk in those woods alone at night"	t5_2t3t8	True
1369912987.0	1fbwgh	I was convinced by a guy on the Internet to run away.	TeslaLikesPigeons	512	79	100	"This all happened 11 years ago when I was 16. All of my interaction with my creeper happened on the Internet so I hope this is the right place for this.  And if this sounds a little disjointed I apologize, this is the first time I have really talked about this. Edit: to add I am female.

I had a friend that introduced me to a guy she new on the internet and I started instant messaging with him because she said he was a friend of a relative.  A lot of my friends were talking with him at the time and me and the friend even video chatted with him once.  I had a computer in my room at this time so I talked to him a lot more than my parents realized at the time.  

Well, the IMing sessions slowly got more sexual. He had convinced me that I shouldn't stay at my home and that I should run away.  He had also convinced me to break up with my boyfriend at the time.  This guy had my stupid 16 year old self completely brainwashed.  

My friend that introduced me to him was also going to run away with me and we were going to meet the guy in New York.  So we arrange it so that I can spend the night at her house that night so we can run away together.  That night we sneak our stuff outside and ""go out for a walk"". We were going to walk to the bus station and get tickets all the way up there. We walk a while but weren't going to make the bus so we looped back around to her house.  At this point she decides that she isn't going to go but convinces me that I should still go.  So in the morning I leave the note for my parents and call a taxi.  It picks me up and drives to the bus station.  The driver knew something was up and he was casually questioning me about where I was going and who I was going to meet.  

We got to the bus station and I go inside to buy my ticket.  I'm sitting there as the clerk is getting my ticket ready and my Dad pulls up like a bat out of hell.  To this day I am grateful I left that note.  He had a hunch that I was going to the bus station and drove so fast that his astro van was on two wheels at some points.  My dad gets me and my stuff and we head home.  

At this point I realize just how stupid I had been and break down.  My parents ask me all the questions about what was going on and why.  They also call the cops.  

A few months go by and an FBI agent calls them wanting to talk to me and take the computer.  My Mom and I talk to the agent for a while and he informs us that they believe they have this same guy in custody right now for luring other girls to him.  He showed me his photo and I ID him as the same guy.  He takes my computer but they don't find anything on it but a few conversations since the ""friend"" that introduced me to him had wiped it pretty good.  Luckily they didn't need me in court to convict this guy, they had some of the other girls that made it all the way to him.  

To this day I am grateful that I left that note and that my Dad listened to his instincts and found me before I got on that bus.  I also found out that that cab driver waited outside where I couldn't see him because he figured out I was a run away, I believe he even called the cops and was waiting for them to show up.  That man will always have my gratitude.  And I was lucky enough that after we told my boyfriend what happened we got back together.  We have been married for eight years now and have a little girl and you can bet she will never have a computer in her room and I will tell her this story when she is old enough."	t5_2t3t8	True

_________________________________

My mum and I moved into a completely normal/average house when I was about 15. Everything was fine, we loved it. One day I was home ""sick"" from school and I was messing around on the computer when I heard our garage door open. I freaked out and went down the hall to get my mobile phone and saw the hallway door that connects to the garage opening, I panicked and yelled ""get out!!!"" and two young boys slammed the door and ran off. I stared crying and called my mum (I don't know why I didn't call the police first) who told me to go next door to my neighbours and she was going to come home from work. When she got home she was speaking to my neighbour for a bit. She (the neighbour) ended up telling us that she thought it was probably the young boy that lived in the house before us... Apparently he sometimes goes around to everyone's houses and ""breaks in"" and eats their food and watches TV and stuff... And for what ever reason, they were all OK with that. Apparently he came from some sort of broken home and they all felt sorry for him so they didn't call the police. Mum and I were completely unsettled by that and put new locks on all the doors that week. We didn't care if the other neighours were OK with that... We weren't.

A few months pass and nothing ever happens again, we figure he knows we're not cool with his weirdness and doesn't try to break in again. A week or so later I'm in bed asleep and I wake up in the middle of night for no reason at all. I'm not hot or cold, I don't need to pee, I didn't have a nightmare... I just woke up. I had this incredibly uneasy and weird feeling wash over me. I felt like something or someone was watching me and I got completely freaked out. I went into my mum's room and slept in her bed that night. It kept happening a few nights and I thought I was just having nightmares or was getting scared of the dark for some reason. I ended up sleeping in my mums bed for about a week because I was so legit scared of the dark now. I finally worked up the courage to sleep in my own bed one night, but I could barely sleep. I felt totally uneasy and nervous/scared. I got to sleep for a bit but then I woke up again. I looked outside my window and I could SWEAR I saw face/figure of someone standing there. Obviously, I nope'd the fuck out and ran back to my mum. 

One of the nights I was back in her bed, we were all asleep and feeling fine when I wake up to my dog on the end of the bed, growling. *Now, our dog is an old golden retriever and has never growled or barked at ANYTHING. She is a huge wuss and completely placid, she has no problem with strangers, even if someone knocks on the door and comes in, she couldn't care less.* So I wake up, all dazed, confused and half asleep. I hear the dog growling and I'm asking her ""what's wrong...?"". I look up from the bed and I shit you not - there is a man standing in the door way... With a knife. I screamed like a banshee and the dog started barking at this point. Mum woke up and saw the man too... He went running down the hallway and out the back door. I'm crying my eyes out, the dog is barking her face off and mum is frantically trying to call the police. An HOUR later they finally get here and of course, the dude is gone. Morning comes and we go outside to see that the back gate has had its lock cut with bolt cutters, and the door leading into the house had been smashed in. The cops come in and dust for prints and leave shit everywhere but at the end of the day, they can't and don't do anything. 

We moved out that **same day** and went to live with my grandma and grampa until we found a new house. Pretty much no one in the family believed us, or thought we were just making it up for attention. (my family are assholes) A few weeks later we get a call from the police and they managed to match the prints to some teenager who just got arrested for breaking into another house. It's the same guy that was breaking into all the houses in the neighbourhood and used to live in the house we were in. So mum's talking to the cops and some of the neighbours when suddenly someone tells us, completely casually, ""Oh yeah, that's the Milat kid."" Wait... Did they just say, **MILAT**? Yeahhhh... Pretty much any Australian will know this last name... [Ivan Milat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpacker_Murders). The serial killer. His NEPHEW was breaking into people's homes... And our home. While we were sleeping. WITH A KNIFE.  And people were OK with that.

...So anyway, we move into a new house and forget all about it... Until about a year ago. 

[Milat nephew gets 43-year jail sentence - NEWS](http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/8480628/milat-nephew-gets-massive-jail-sentence) 

He and his friend *murdered* another teenager in the same fucking place his uncle dumped all those bodies. **...WTF!?**

So... The guy that broke into our house, watched me while I was asleep and stood in our bedroom doorway with a knife while we were sleeping actually MURDERED another teenager a few years later. Mum and I nearly fell over when we heard about it. No one really believes us... Which pisses me off. But it really happened. 

Sometimes when I think back on what could've happened if I slept in my own bed that night, or if the dog didn't bark, or if we never woke up... It really freaks me out. It's also left me with a huge fear of the dark. I get really uneasy if I have to go outside at night by myself or if I wake up in the middle of the night. Sometimes I have a panic attack when I go outside to put the bins out at night now."	t5_2t3t8	True
1360657969.0	18da56	Was told to post this here...		487	62	41	"I didn't even know this subreddit existed until ShiningBrightness suggested I post this here, so here it goes:

I was heading from dayton ohio up to a show in Cleveland, about 30 minutes from my destination my car breaks down. At the time I was only 16 so I was still pretty reliant on my parents and knew nothing about cars, so I called up my dad and had him arrange the details to get someone to come out for me and my car. After about a hour of waiting the truck pulls up and I feel relieved ill be able to head home after all the stress, not even so much bummed about the show. I should not have felt relieved. At first I thought he was nothing more then a average neck beard, until the ride home.

To start things off as soon as I got into his truck he asked me why I was out here all alone, and if anybody was going to look for me. I realized how weird of a question but proceeded to answer it just to relieve the tension.

It was around 7pm when he picked me up an on the way back about 30 minutes in he asked it I wanted to get something to eat from McDonald's, I said yes. As I'm in line at McDonald's getting my food I can feel his eyes just staring at me from behind, I turn and glance over my shoulder and notice him looking at me and blatantly licking his lips (I'm a dude). At this point I had no idea what to do, I got my food and returned to the truck and tried to keep to myself, I just wanted the ride to be over with.

After sitting there in silence for awhile I hear the strangest sentence someone has ever heard to me ""if you sit there and act like a deer, I'm going to gut you like one"". Of course me feeling defenseless I just make an awkward chuckle. But then he pulls out his decent sized pocket knife and is just holding it up by the steering wheel, not threatening me with it but he was almost admiring it. To break the silence since I didn't want to be gutted I asked him if he had any good stories about some of his pick ups and drives back. He gives me some story about some girl he took back, and said something about how her walls of her room was blue. This was good to hear because I figured he wouldn't want to rape me or anything. 

A bit later he pulled out his shitty flip phone, asked if I wanted to see something funny and I said sure. He told me to scoot closer to the middle of the seat, and out of pure stupidity, I did. The first thing he did when I scooted closer was throw his arm over my shoulder faster then I could process what happened, he said it was hard to show me the videos on his phone and drive so it was easier.

The first video he showed me was of some Mexican man or something sitting at a police station looking like he was waiting to be processed in, the man took a sip of a flask out of his jacket and then a gun and shot himself in the head. It was so fucked up.

I told him that is messed up and not funny at all. He let out the most manic laughter I have ever heard. I tried to scoot back but he had a stiff arm to the side of me that I could tell was not going to move. He told me he had better videos. The next one was of a girl being fucked by a horse, and apparently it killed her as she fell to the ground flat on her face, he told me his brother took that video. The last video, was a video of a vagina, looked normal at first until the girl reached her hand into her vagina and took out a huge fish. Literally reached in, and took out a bass or catfish or something, it was a big one. 

After we neared the town I lived in he asked where my apartment was not knowing how old I was, I said it would be at my dads house and he immediately stopped the truck and said ""just when I thought this was going to be fun."" Pulled over on the side of the road and let my car down about 10 minutes before home, he got back in and told me this is as far as he can go and he will see me again soon. I looked at him puzzle, I didn't pay him and I didn't see how he couldn't drive 10 more minutes but I didn't care. I got out and he pulled off. My phone was dead so I proceeded to just walk the rest of the way and make it home. As soon as I walked in my dad asked where I had been and who brought me home, I told him the story and about the creepy truck drier and how I felt terrified. He told me the tow truck service he called had notified him that I wasn't there when they sent out a driver. 


Tl;dr: car broke down and a tow truck driver picked me up. Threatened to gut me like a deer, put his arm around me, and showed me videos of suicide, death by horse fucking, and vagina fish. Turns out it was just some random guy with a truck and not from the company that was supposed to take me home. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1328040104.0	p4yvt	"One of the best things I've ever 
done..."	KyrieEleison_88	480	58	45	"I live in Brooklyn, NY and though it gets a bad rap I have never had anything bad happen to me personally and if you grow up here you generally know how to behave to keep your ass out of trouble.

I was hanging out in a park with my two best friends when I was around 13/14 and we were just sitting on some benches talking. It was the middle of summer, and there were tons of little kids in the park. We usually hung out on the swings but of course let the little ones take them. While talking I noticed from the corner of my eye two little girls around 7/8 years old being called to the gate that separated the park from the sidewalk. There was a large black guy who was in a red car that he soon got out of. He was talking to them in a way that I felt wasn't appropriate, what kind of adult comes up to random little girls? 

I tried to think the best, maybe he knew them, right? I heard him ask them if they wanted to go with him, the girls seemed uncomfortable and I was on red alert. He ended up stepping away and the girls were sort of going over the conversation and trying to figure out if they should go or not. I said to them ""Do you know him?"" My blood ran cold when they said no. 

We sprang into action and one of my friends went to walk a few feet over and write down his license plate number. I flat out said to them ""You're not going with him and to get away from the gate"" they did as they were told and stood near my other friends (who is more maternal) who helped them not be so freaked out. The man called out ""Where ya going?"" And I told him he'd ""better leave these girls alone, you don't even know and to get the fuck out"" Dejected, he watched them for a few more seconds then got in his car and left. I could finally breathe again.

In retrospect I should have went the few blocks to the police station and reported him, but I instead gave the girls a very serious talk about strangers, especially strange men, and to never consider getting into a car with someone they don't know. They seemed receptive (thankfully) and I sae their parents pick them up about 30 minutes later. I refused to leave until I knew they were safe. I don't know what would have happened if I hadn't followed my gut to keep my eye on them. But even if they had decided they were going to go with him, come hell or high water they weren't getting past me and into that car.

Not as scary as some of these stories, but it's honestly one of best actions I've ever taken."	t5_2t3t8	True
1331728829.0	qw34s	I think this may be original, I was the creepy one	Derp1121	513	92	71	To start off with, I was OBSESSED with ninjutsu, absolutely consumed. I had all sorts of books and gear, including an entire ninja outfit. I loved wearing it, for no reason at all sometimes. Well one day two of my friends and I are going to SF and I decide out of the blue to wear that outfit. We go around to various parks in the city, and the whole time people keep giving me weird looks. I notice people are shying away from me as I walk down the path as well. I'm with two girls (we're all in our twenties) so I'm curious as to why I'm getting these looks. I just shrug it off and ninja around. Then I climb a tree in one of the parks and hang out while the girls I was with wander off to the ladies room. I wanted to hide like a ninja. I then hear one of the girls call my name, so I drop out of the tree. However I didn't look around the tree when I did, and some young couple was having engagement photos taken right under me. I dropped down RIGHT NEXT TO THEM! The couple along with the photographer freeze for a brief second. The woman screams and gets up and runs away. The guy freaks out, shouting and looking like he's gonna kick the crap out of me. The photographer stands there stunned. I look at them and decide it's probably a good idea to bolt. I get the fuck out of there, and eventually find my friends. I hope I didn't traumatize that poor woman too much.	t5_2t3t8	True
1363303243.0	1abear	Camping horror	mjoallie	480	64	64	"  This happened to my parents back in the late 80's. They were in their mid 20s when this all occurred. My parents decided to go camping in Cool, California. When they got there, it was kind of late. My Mom was sitting down on a log while my Dad was unpacking the truck. While sitting down, she heard walking around the campsite, so she went and quietly told my Dad she heard someone walking around. They noped the fuck out of there, just in case.  
  They drove about 3 miles down the road with their headlights off, so they wouldn't be followed. Once they got there, they set up camp, and began to drink their asses off while listening to a boxing match on the radio. Eventually, they settled in for the night. 
  Now, they don't know for sure that this next event is connected to the first, but they believe it is. So, they settled in and my Dad was asleep far before my Mom. My mom was in the half-way state where you're half way awake and half-way asleep. Suddenly, she heard footsteps outside the tent. She abruptly snapped back to consciousness and listened. She tried waking my Dad but he was way too out of it. She listened for what seemed like hours when suddenly she hears, in the creepiest voice you could probably ever imagine say ""Here I ammmmmmmmm. I'm going to killlllllllll youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu."" While saying this the man ran, what she believes to be a knife, along the tent. She could hear him walking and dragging the knife. She was literally frozen. She couldn't say anything or move. With her mouth agape, she finally snapped out of it and screamed ""JIM, GRAB THE SHOTGUN. KILL THAT SON OF A BITCH."" With that, my Dad finally awoke. They heard snapping of twigs and footsteps, and heard the guy running away. Of course, my parents didn't have a shotgun. It was a huge bluff that actually worked. My Dad got up seconds later and began to run after him, but he was long gone. 
 After that, my parents decided they were getting the fuck out of there before anything else happened. When they saw, their tires were slashed. They were in the middle of nowhere and no way out with some maniac that wanted to kill them. They actually tried blowing up their tires with one of those things you use to blow up rafts. Obviously, that didn't work, but they had to try, right? About an hour or so later, a ranger that was patrolling the area came along and helped them out. He brought them back to town, so they could get their tires fixed. While talking to the ranger, they found out that he had been searching for any suspicious activity due to recent murders nearby. My parents were likely the murderers next victims. I tried finding some of the murder cases online, but was unable to. If you guys have any questions, I will ask my parents to answer them the best they can."	t5_2t3t8	True
1374333045.0	1ip3tj	I will make you love me. Or the story of my lesbian stalker.	sheetpoppypills	476	67	61	"I'm sorry this story is so long, I've only told a handful of people and re telling it makes me feel nauseous. This is almost a form of therapy for me so I hope someone can get something positive out of it :)

This happened about 3 years ago when I was 16. I had left highschool and was working in a hair salon. That's where I met one of my best friends, Adam. Adams mum lived around the corner from where I grew up and was good friends with my cousin. Small world huh?

So one weekend I went around to his place for a few drinks. I met his mum who was lovely. She was only 36, really down to earth and had an aura of motherly love you could trust. We decided to go into the town center for a few beers. In my country if you're with a parent or guardian you can drink legally. We were having an awesome time, blowing off steam after a long week of work and sharing a bit of quality banter. 

We were at the pub for about an hour when a few of Adams friends showed up with a girl called Jay. I don't want to sound rude but when I first met Jay I honestly thought she was a man. She was very androgynous, with shoulder length dirty blonde hair, a baggy orange t-shirt that almost came down to her knees with navy blue cargo pants. This in itself is a crime against fashion, and I remember wondering (not in a mean way) why she was hanging out with Adams friends as they're all massive fashionistas with barbed tongues and no qualms in calling out fashion disasters. 

I excused myself to go to the ladies room and when I got back Jay had moved around in the seats so I would be forced to sit next to her at the end of the table, away from everyone else. No biggie, I'm a social person and always up to make new friends! 

She sat really close to me, almost rubbing up against me even though there was a lot of space for her to move over. Red flag no.1. I passed this off as me being big on personal space and her being a little tipsy. When she talked she would lean in really close to my face and breath stale beer and cigarettes almost directly into my mouth. I asked her to move over a few times but after a few minutes she would scootch back over. 

The conversation was normal and at this point my creeper radar wasn't dinging. She mentioned she was from South Africa and moved here a few years ago with her mother. She told me she was a lesbian and I asked if I was too. I told her I was Bisexual but was seeing a man. 

This is when she went off on a big tirade against Bisexuals. If you're Bisexual you will know what I'm talking about. Either you're actually a lesbian and too scared to come out or you're actually strait, just experimenting and trying to have the best of both worlds. She took the stance that I was actually a lesbian and didn't know it yet. This REALLY pissed me off. I don't appreciate being told by a stranger what MY sexuality is, thanks. 

After a few more beers Adam, his mother and I decided to head home for a smoke and a movie. I had basically been alienated from the table for the last hour so I had missed out on talking to everyone else, but as it turns out Adams friends were going to a party later on and asked if we wanted to come. Neither of us were sure yet so we agreed to head home, have a shower and see how we feel. Adam didn't have a cell phone at the time so I jotted down mine on a piece of paper and handed it to one of the boys. 

About 5 minutes into the taxi ride I got a text message. ""R u coming to the party?"" we had JUST agreed to give them a call if we felt like coming later on so I was a little annoyed with being hounded and didn't text back. 

20 minutes later, my phone beeps again. ""U r the sexiest woman I have ever met."" Woah, woah, WOAH. At this point I still thought it was Adams friend, the one I actually gave my number to. He's a flaming gay so naturally I assumed it was a badly placed joke? Whatever. I texted back something like ""Not as sexy as you Mr. Fabulous pants.""

Big Mistake. 

My phone beeped again. ""It was nice meting u, I want to see you again. Right now. luv Jay.""

It was Jay. Fuck. Up until this point I had just put everything down to cultural differences, but now I was feeling very uncomfortable. I didn't text back after that. Even though I recieved about 20 messages all along the lines of ""were r u? Why arnt u txtng bak? I hav 2 see u right now. Were the fuk are u? Txt me back right fukn now.""

I showed Adam and his mum the text and we all agreed the best thing I could do was to ignore the texts and hope she gives up. I turned off my phone and after that there was no way I was in the mood to go anywhere. We stayed in, had another few beers and watched a movie. 

Cut to a few days later and I was at a work function/party when I get a call from an unknown number. I answered it think it might be a client. A lot of my bosses clients work really late so often call to book in after hours, as her assistant it's my job to take her calls. They're rich and can spend about $500 on a hair colour in one sitting so it's in the businesses interest to take these calls. 

The woman on the other end asked if she could have a date. I had almost forgotten about Jay and nothing the person on the phone said seemed out of the ordinary. Just asking if she could book in a date to be 'serviced.' Of course you can Ma'am, what's you name and number? 
""It's Jay, and I need to see you now. I love you and I need you.""

I hung up the phone immediately and ran into the bathroom, bursting into tears. Having a mini panic attack in the middle of a very important work function, mascara streaming down my face was NOT a good look. For the salon or for my career. I collected myself, turned my phone off and was determined to power through the evening. No crazy bitch was going to stop me being awesome at my job, godamnit. I'm a strong, fabulous career orientated woman. FABULOUS I say!

Cut to the end of the evening, I was still a little shaken up but had mostly forgotten about the incident. I asked a co-worker to drop me off at the train station, so I didn't have to walk in the dark by myself. I'm fabulous but not stupid! She dropped me off one street over and as I went to cross the road, guess who came out of the bushes? That's right. Motha fuckin' Jay. That's not even an exaggeration. She was sitting IN the bushes, WAITING for me to come to the train station. 

I only froze for half a second before I started power walking towards the train. I ran across the road, almost getting my dumb ass hit but I was too scared to look both ways. All the while being highly aware of the shrieking coming from behind me. ""I LOVE YOU"" it shouted ""I WONT LET YOU GO. YOU NEED TO KNOW YOU LOVE ME. I WILL ***MAKE*** YOU LOVE ME.""

I was at my wits end. I had no idea what to do. I certainly wasn't going to let her follow me on the train. There was no way I was going to be in a confined space with this she devil, and there was ABSOLUTELY no way I was going to let her follow me home. I sprinted to the ticket booth and started screaming between my sobs I was being followed, to call the police. I made a complete spectacle of myself, people were looking and the ticket officer was trying to calm me down. The poor man pulled me into his office, made me a cup of tea while I waited for the police. They showed up after about 10 minutes and I told them everything and showed them the text messages. There was about 50 more since I had turned off my phone at the function. I couldn't even bring myself to read them and the police officer told me that was probably a good idea. Ugh. 

Since she hadn't physically hurt me the police told me there was not a lot they could do but file a restraining order. I didn't know her last name, her address or what she did. I couldn't even be sure Jay was her real name. Her number was pre-paid so there was no more information on her from that avenue. Dead end. The police drove me home and told me to give them a call if anything else happened. I didn't sleep that night. 

I changed my phone number and asked for a few days off work. My boss was really understanding and I spent two days locked in my room with a giant tub of ice cream, trying to process and understand that this had happened. 

Skip to a week later and I get a call from the police to come down to the station. They had arrested a woman who had claimed I was her girlfriend, and that I would bail her out of the cells. She had given my old cell phone number for them to call. It was Jay. 

Someone had called in about a suspicious looking man (lol) hanging around the train station, accosting and threatening other patrons and defecating on the platform. They found a knife, some meth and letters written in blood in her bag. I was told she was on parole for beating her ex girlfriend nearly to death, and was heading back to jail. 

I've since moved from that town, changed my name (not because of this) and changed professions but I'm still terrified that one day when she gets out she will find me again, and I might end up like her ex girlfriend. Beaten near to death.

TL;DR Meet androgynous lesbian who tells me what my sexuality is. She stalks me home one night and is later arrested with a knife, letters of blood and meth.  "	t5_2t3t8	True
1374613871.0	1iwsx1	The Bag Lady	MaltesePanda	461	59	71	"I have always had an inate fear of the night. Not so much the dark, but the night itself. As a child my imagination was overcome with stories of creatures that come alive at night and the safety offered by a house and light. I never had anything to base this fear on until a night when I decided to go with a buddy of mine to a baseball game and got stuck at a light at 2 a.m. after dropping him off at home.

Of course that night the game went into extra innings and so I didn't get a chance to drop my friend off back home until well after 1 a.m. Everything was fine on the way home until I hit a light right before the street that led to my house. It was a ""T"" junction and I was turning left. The light is one of those that you think is broken until it finally turns green right when you finally decide to just run it. Of course I pulled up right as the light turned red.

I would have just run the light, seeing as no one was there and it was closing in on 2 a.m. on a school night, but earlier that week I had heard the phrase ""Character is what you do when no one is looking"" and for whatever reason, that was the night I decided to prove to myself that I was a man of character, big mistake.

I pulled to a stop at the light feeling good about myself, bordering on self-righteous, when I happened to look out my window to my left and noticed a lady sitting all alone on a bus bench. We made brief eye contact and I quickly looked away. It was too late. I could see movement out of my peripheral vision and knew she was coming my way. I looked out the window and noticed she was carrying a bag. I quickly checked that my doors were locked and all my windows were up. I then moved my right foot above the accelerator just in case and braced myself for what was to come. I was hoping it would be just an awkward exchange and was praying for a quick light change before she reached me, so I could just get out of there, I knew there was a slim chance of that.

She walked right up to my window, put down her bag and began to tap on my window. I nervously looked up at her and she motioned for me to put my window down. I had automatic windows so I just imagined pushing too hard on the window button and that thing just coming all the way down, so I took a deep breath and lightly flicked it with my finger. The window moved microscopically down, but she did not seem to notice or care. She then leaned in and began to talk.

She said, ""My boyfriend beat me up, I have a friend who lives down the street, can you give me a ride?""

I should stop and give a brief physical description of the bag lady. She was small and skinny and of indeterminate age. She was either in her mid twenties and had lived a hard 20+ years on the street, or she was a 60-something year old who had lived a moderately hard life on the street. All that to say, just by looking at her, there was no way to verify her story. She looked beat up by life, not just by a boyfriend. But there was something about her delivery, it was robotic and seemed practiced and like she was disconnected from the moment, that made my skin crawl, and after a brief (about a second) debate on whether I should do it, I told her that I had to get home and could not give her a ride.

After my first refusal she leaned in closer and said the same thing again, ""My boyfriend beat me up, I have a friend who lives down the street, can you give me a ride?"" This time I felt more confident when I declined to give her a ride and told her I had a curfew and had to get home.

She leaned in a third time and began her statement again, ""My boyfriend beat me..."" At this point, the light changed. I slowly lifted my foot off the brake and started slowly rolling forward and began muttering an apology. She didn't move. She just looked at the light then looked down at me, leaned in closer and said five words that have haunted me ever since, ""You made the right decision"". Then she picked up her bag and walked back towards the bench. 

I peeled out of the intersection and cried and screamed all the way home. I have no idea what she planned to do, or if there were people waiting to jump in my car from the bushes had I moved to let her in, but that encounter has haunted me ever since and has confirmed in my mind, that nothing good happens after dark."	t5_2t3t8	True
1376570230.0	1kexvb	My Best Friend's Dad	theharper	461	62	48	"Thinking about how oblivious I was when this was all happening gives me chills. For background: I was fifteen years old, pretty new to public school, and having friends, after having been home schooled for years upon years. 

I made a group of friends pretty easily, though I would realize later I just had befriended the group of people who talked to me first, not people I had anything in common with. But one of the girls, Kristin, and I became rather close. We had classes together, we had sleepovers together, we went to the school dances together... 

I was an amateur photographer in high school, and one of my friend's parents offered to pay me $50 to take prom photos for my group of friends since I wasn't going. I was so excited because it was my first professional gig, and I was getting to see my friends off to prom.

But, as I was taking the photos, I noticed something was off. My best friend's dad wasn't there. He was always wherever she was. I saw her grandparents, but I never saw him. I shrugged it off, and I kept taking couple pictures and the stereotypical ""let's all get in a line and put our hands on our hips"" picture. 

I finally saw him. He was standing behind some trees at the edge of the yard taking pictures... which seems normal enough, except he was taking pictures of me. Just me. I moved us all to the backyard to get different shots, and then I saw him behind some bushes. Still just taking pictures of me.

I just ignored the feeling that had me ready to leave and finished my job. My mom came to pick me up, and as I got in the car, she asked why the was someone taking pictures of us driving away. As I looked in the rearview mirror, I saw him standing in the middle of the street taking pictures of my mom's car as we drove off. I told her that he was just trying to get pictures of all of the friends, even the ones not going to prom.

All of this should have been a red flag, but Kristin was my best friend, and I wasn't going to let what had happened stop us from hanging out. I thought it must have been something in my head-- I wondered if I was just being too dramatic.

Well, a few weeks later, Kristin asked if I wanted to spend the night at her house. I had never spent the night over there as she always came over to my house, so I jumped on the opportunity. Her house was incredibly large and beautiful-- the only people who lived there were her mom, who was wheelchair bound and never left her room, her dad, and herself. 

The day itself wasn't too eventful, and I don't really remember all that we did other than watch movies and eat smores. But I'll always remember this night. We had decided to sleep in the living room, and we were both asleep when some noise woke me up. I think it was her cat in the litter box, but I'm not sure. I got pretty creeped out as soon as I woke up because one of the walls of the room was just a bunch of windows with no curtains or blinds.  I decided to go to the bathroom so I could be in a room with some light and calm myself down. I couldn't remember which room was the bathroom, so I slowly cracked open a door down the hall that I thought might be it... but I was wrong.

It was a darkroom. Not dark as in no light, but as in this is where Kristin's dad developed his film. And hanging up all over the room where pictures of me, from when I took the prom photos and some from when I was being picked up from school. 

I started panicking... I had no idea what to do. I just wanted to leave immediately. I went back to the living room and decided to call my mom to come get me. I didn't explain anything on the phone or wake up Kristin, but my mom told me to put my regular clothes back on and wait for her. I didn't want to risk trying to find the bathroom again, so I just stepped into a corner of the room and started to change my top. I heard a noise and looked up to see Kristin's dad just standing in the entryway of the living room watching me. He didn't say anything or move, he just stood there staring at me. I quickly put my top on, and then just stood there not moving.

We continued to stand like that until I got text from my mom saying she had pulled into the driveway. I grabbed my bag, and I walked to the front door and left without saying anything to Kristin's dad who was still just standing there watching me.

I never told anyone about what happened, not even Kristin. I just slowly started pulling away from her because I was starting to realize how crazy she was, too (she deserves her own /r/letsnotmeet story).

After the summer had ended, I had a whole new group of friends who weren't creepy and didn't have fathers who watched me constantly, though I did see Kristin's father a few months later and he gave me a huge hug and told me I would always be his. So creepy.  

Edit 1: Spelling/typos  

Edit 2: There was a request for me to elaborate on the hug at the end. Kristin's mother was seriously ill, probably because she weighed over 400 lbs. She was constantly in the hospital, and she got MRSA after a surgery she had. She died a few weeks later; Kristin called me to let me know since I used to be a close friend. She asked if I would go to the funeral to support her since she was going through such a hard time dealing with it all. I agreed, but only if I could bring my older sister. I didn't want to be around them by myself, but I did want to pay my respects to the always oblivious mother and send my well-wishes to Kristin's grandparents because they were always really sweet to both me and Kristin.

My older sister and I went to the viewing, the funeral/burial, and the wake afterwards. The viewing is where things went slightly awry. My sister walked off to say hello to someone she knew, and Kristin's dad approached me. He gave me a long, long, long, awkward hug where he rubbed his hand up and down my back (from my shoulders down to the top my butt, and whispered about how beautiful I looked and how I'd always be his favorite of Kristin's friends, that I was special to him, that he'd never forget me, etc.. At his wife's funeral!! I nearly passes out from the panic after that encounter, and I grabbed my sister, and we left.

Some people asked why I never told my mom/anyone-- I don't really have a good answer. For a while I thought that it might all be exaggerated in my head and I didn't want to cause issues in their family if it was innocent. I obviously realize that it wasn't innocent now, but I've moved on from it considering it's been five years. 

I never talked to Kristin about it, nor did I ask if her father had molested her. Though in hindsight, I think he must've because she had a LOT of emotional problems and problems with her sexuality. I wanted to reach out to her, but I was also kind of afraid of her after [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1kexvb/my_best_friends_dad/cboaafp) happened. She's married now, and I don't know if I should bring all of that up.  

As for her father, last I heard, he had married a Mexican woman who didn't speak a bit of English (he doesn't speak Spanish either). No clue about that."	t5_2t3t8	True
1373775876.0	1i9c3i	I deliver pizzas and was sent to what was almost definitely a robbery/murder/rape/jumping	relytv2	477	77	73	"So I work at a pizza place, usually inside as my insurance does not cover claims when driving for business, but occasionally I will cover a delivery shift for one of the drivers because the money is good. 



Our delivery area includes a few new development ""upper middle class"" cookie cutter neighborhoods (Bad tips), an older 1940s era village (Average tips), two apartment complexes (great tips), some trailer parks (Great tips or no tips), and a bunch of rural areas (Usually good tips). Not rural to the point seeing hundreds of stars at night, but enough that you couldn't hear your neighbors yell. 



So about a week ago I was covering a delivery shift, I come back to the shop feeling pretty good, I'm averaging $5 a delivery and they have all been pretty close, and check to see if I have anymore deliveries. I have one to an address I have never seen before (we have mostly semi regulars get deliveries so an address that doesn't seem the least bit familiar is odd) its out on one of the more rural roads, I ask the kid who took the order what was up because there were special instructions on the ticket. He says, ""They said go around back because the front door is not operational."" I'm like ok that's not *that* uncommon, people often want you to go around back, either they painted the door, the house shifted and its a bitch to open, or they are just hanging out back.



So as I'm driving out to the house and I get an odd feeling, I don't really like the idea of going to the back of some house out in the sticks. It would all be too easy for some thugs to order a pizza to an abandoned house (there are quite a few in the more rural areas) then jump the delivery guy. I figure i'll scope the place out when I get there and if it seems sketchy just call them and make some bull up about how its against company policy to go around back of houses to prevent robberies. 



As I am driving to the house I realize its towards the end of this road that gets less populated the further down you go, *great*. I'm pretty near the address and driving slow, I see this house abandoned looking and set back from the roads with no address and in a bunch of trees, I think, ""that house better not be it"" so I drive passed and check the next houses' address and lo and behold, that abandoned looking one was the right house....*shit*. At this point I am not super worried though because out in the boonies the standards of upkeep on your house are pretty low so a house in disrepair isn't unusual. 



So I double back to this house and pull into the drive way, at this point I am getting bad vibes, it just doesn't feel right. So I park my car at the very end of the driveway with the rear of the car on the shoulder so anyone passing by can clearly see it. At this point I call back to the shop and tell them I'm at this sketchy house and if I don't call back in four or five minutes call me and if I don't answer call the cops.



While I am on the phone I take a chance to take a good look at the house. It looks extremely abandoned and not just in disrepair. The driveway is crumbling, bits are gravel and there are weeds growing out of it. There is no mailbox, no trashcans, no car, no lawnmowers, no landscapaing, no kids toys, absolutely nothing in the yard. The yard hasn't been mowed in what looks like years, the house is total crap, the roof is all but falling apart, the siding *is* falling apart, the back deck which comes around the side is falling apart, the only part of the house that looks even a little bit decent is the allegedly non functioning front door. The windows are all shut (its 95 degrees and humid and this place does not have a/c) they all have the blinds or curtains shut, the few that aren't are actually boarded up. I don't even see any wires running to this house. Its not dark but is dusk and there isn't a sign of any lights on in the house. 



At this point I am starting to get pretty nervous, I am a 5'10"" male 180lbs, not in any great shape, but I did take karate for 10 years, so I'm not helpless, but I do try to avoid any sort of confrontation I can as I am mostly a pacifist. I'm not too concerned about getting robbed, no skin off my teeth its not my money. I mean I would rather not get robbed, but I'm mostly worried about getting jumped, or killed, its a fairly safe area but recently there have been some rather unsavory people moving in from the city. A big spike in home invasions and robberies, but more worrying a few stabbings and assaults. 



So its time to either nut up or shut up. I'm not just going to go charging in there like a fool so I get out my phone and call the number they gave when ordering, while I'm doing that I'm also getting the pizza out and make sure to leave my door open. A running car half in the road at an abandoned house with the door open looks suspicious right? I figure if shit goes down it might look out of place enough to make someone stop, not that there is really any traffic this far down the road. 



I am starting to walk up to the house while the phones ringing; it rings twice and then an automated message comes on. It says something along the lines of this phone number is associated with a internet texting app (one the free ones you download and let you send free texts from a different phone number over a data connection) I think it was Heywire. We have had issues with people using numbers from those services for pranks in the past. 



This is huge red flag, my heart is now pounding in my throat and my whole body is telling me to bail. I don't want to get a reputation for being a flaky bitch as a driver and lose any future delivery shifts, and that is why I have not bailed yet. So I'm just standing there holding a pizza looking at this house but not wanting to venture around to the back of it. I'm hoping that the resident will look out the window and come out by the road to get their food. So I am looking at the front windows checking for some sign of life. I see a blind go up on the one window next to the front door and a really creepy looking guy, with a hat pulled low and big sunglasses on is looking out. Remember he is in a completely dark house surrounded by trees, at dusk, there is no reason for him to be wearing sunglasses, I also see what appears to be a big guy standing behind him in the room, this could have been anything though. When he sees me looking me mouths something and he darts away presumably towards the allegedly broken front door. At this point I noped the fuck out. I had stayed pretty close to my car so it was only a few steps away so I jumped into the driver's seat and throw the pizza into my passenger seat, something I would never do since I am really anal about keeping my car clean. I slam it into reverse, before I get the clutch all the way in so I grind my gears a little, again something I never do. 



Without looking I simultaneously slam and lock my door, and floor it backwards onto the main road, slipping my clutch horribly but at this point I don't care I don't want to fuck around and risk a stall. I did not even check for cross traffic (really stupid on my part). I start to drive away and look back at the house, the screen door on the outside of the front door is now open but the front is still shut. The guy isn't out in the yard yelling wait come back or anything, he's just gone. So I pull over a little ways up the road to call back to shop and tell them I'm all good and I'll elaborate when I get back. 



The people never called back to inquire about their food, people usually call if their pizza is 15 minutes late and these people never got it so its really strange they didn't call. Pretty much confirming they were up to no good. After telling my co-workers about it we conclude it was definitely a robbery at the very least. So we put the address and phone number on our no deliveries list, and ate their pizza. I doubt I would have actually gotten murdered or anything. Robbed with maybe a gun pulled or a little roughing up yes, but it was still very unnerving, that I easily *could have* gotten into some serious trouble by just doing my job. Especially if the idiots picked a slightly less abandoned house to set up at.





Sorry for the for a relatively minor incident being so long, but hey I like to write even if I am not that good at it. Anyone who deliveries pizza be wary of situations like this, I looked into it and apparently it is a pretty common way to rob pizza guys. I'm pretty glad we did not end up meeting.



TL;DR I got sent on a delivery to an abandoned house, and was very close to getting robbed/attacked/murdered."	t5_2t3t8	True
1340305793.0	ve8zw	[Comp] My schizophrenic neighbor	taheca	452	57	51	"My wife and I purchased our house about 6 years ago, and decided to start a family. I love our neighborhood, and our neighbors, and especially love to go out for long walks at night. 

One neighbor is a single mom, and has three kids. Never really thought much about it though I often would remark to my wife about how awesome it was that she could afford such a nice house, and always seem to be around. 

It became apparent one day though that something was wrong. We started seeing different things sprinkled around her house. Fake plastic flowers tied to her mailbox, dressed up with ribbons and doll heads, just creepy stuff.  After a quick pow wow with my neighbors we found out that she had a history of mental disorders, and they all feared she had stopped taking her medication.

Over the period of a couple of weeks she began acting more and more erratic. She would peel out of her driveway in her car, race up and down the street, wander around, and would come up to various neighbors and give them random presents (a rock, shiny stone, plastic toy, etc).

One evening I go out on one of my regular walks and I can instantly tell something is up. Her car is parked sideways on her driveway. Every exterior and interior light was on in and around her house, and she was pacing back and forth in her yard.  I crossed the street and hid in some shadows and just decided to observe her.  I have training in Human Development and am a generalist in knowledge around emotional and behavioral disorders.

Suddenly I saw her sprint across the street to my side of the street, and jump up on my neighbors porch, right in front of the door and just stood there.  She stood there for a good 10 minutes and then, very slowly turned around and started to walk back across the street. 

I thought about calling the police, but she was technically not doing anything wrong (well maybe trespassing, but I knew her kids were friends with these neighbors kids). So I started walking across the street and intercepted her. I did not startle her and said loudly ""Hi (her name) how are you?""

Now I don't have any direct experience working with people during breakdowns, and after seeing her eyes and behavior have no desire ever to.

She immediately was friendly and said hi, asked about my pregnant wife, and that was when I noticed that she had two open lock knives in each hand.  Now I was creeped out, but still did not feel like I was in danger. I was really more worried that she was a danger to herself.

I continued talking and she suddenly said, I really need your help. I can't get my DVD player to work, can you fix it for me? My curiosity was out of control at this point, and I am much larger than her (not that it means anything I guess when a person is out of their mind, but figured If I was cautious it would be ok).

I entered her house and literally walked into a nightmare.  The place was trashed, there was garbage bags and dirt on the floor. All of her possessions were stacked up in various areas of the living room and kitchen. There were broken light fixtures, the kitchen sink was filled with dishes and rotting food.

Suddenly she went full on with manic behavior.  Started explaining how the different piles were different cities, and then became completely nonsensical in her speech. She was using English words but completely out of context (ex. Painting dish fox poll pool barbell) and then would look to me for a reaction.

Honestly I should not have been there but I had just finished up two years of studying human development, including schizophrenia which is definitely what she was. It was just so utterly fascinating to me, and even though she still had the knives I never felt threatened by her. In fact the opposite, she was so glad to have some company.

I started to quickly scan her house looking for weapons, drugs, or anything else she could harm herself with.  She led me upstairs which was completely trashed as well. She was using small potted plants with the plants half dead in them as ashtrays, her clothes were everywhere.

I went into her master bedroom and honestly did try to set up the DVD player while she randomly walked around the house talking.  Even though the TV was like mine, I just could not get the TV to recognize the DVD player for some reason, and I was starting to get nervous.  

During this time I noticed that she had set the knives down and  I quickly folded them up and pocketed them. I apologized to her that I could not get the DVD player to work, and then asked her if she thought it was time for her to take her medicine. She assured me that she already had, and asked me if I had a joint. I told her no.

I scanned the upstairs and saw no more knives or weapons, and it was sad.  You could tell that her kids had left in a hurry. Their rooms were trashed and they had left their Nintendo DS's behind.

Not seeing any more weapons I went back downstairs to double check the kitchen but she was watching me now, and I did not want to be obvious.  I apologized for not being able to help her, but thought it was time we both went to bed, and that she might want to stay inside now. She agreed with me.

I left and when finally outside realized that I had just walked into her madness, and even I felt a little strange afterwards. It had just been too bizarre.

The next day was Mother's day. I found out later that her husband's parents had taken her kids away from her a week before that due to her erratic behavior. With Mother's day approaching she just lost it even more.

Eventually she went away and came back about a month later, and was back to her normal self. Friendly but subdued.

I still live down the street from her, and say hi to her, but it is the saddest thing to see. You can tell she is on her medication and regulated, but she has no emotion, no personality.  She lost her husband and her children to her disease, but the big unknown is where she gets her money (leading theory is very wealthy parents). She used to be a corporate buyer for a large corporation buying large lots of goods all over the country (which I believe is tied into the various cities she formed in her house with her things).

She had another episode about a year ago, and I found out that I am now her reach out to person during them. I was working in my yard and she came up to me raving mad that they would not put a stop sign on my street (which I actually agree with her about), and started swearing and ranting and then gave me a glass stone that she told me would protect me and my beautiful family. 

She is back to being fine now, but I know what signs to look for around her house. I still have the glass stone and keep it on a ledge I can see when I walk down the stairs in my house. To me it serves as a reminder of how truly lucky I am with what I have, and how bad life can be for those afflicted with mental illness.

UPDATE 07/23/2013 - Her teenage son was just killed while out Skateboarding at night... she is off her medication.. as if the tragedy could not get any worse.. She came over to see me and broke down crying in my arms. This is such a tragedy, I am glad I can at least be there for her.

1345049620.0	y9oza	Nearly murdered, but didn't know it at the time.	ambergirl1229	457	60	72	"When my now ex-husband and I were in between moving from one apartment to another we decided to save some money by staying with my brother and his wife and kids for the summer. My husband and brother were both union carpenters who happened to be working on the same job at the time, so the convenience was a huge factor.

I was not working, as we had just had our daughter and she was only a few months old at the time. My sister-in-law, who also stayed home with the children, had decided to run some errands with her girls and so it was myself and my infant at home alone.

Let me say that they lived in a nice, newer neighborhood in a small town that was at least 45 minutes from the nearest large city. It is a safe community where the worst thing that happens is kids trying to be big and getting into trouble. There hadn't been anything beyond traffic violations and accidents for well over 50 years or longer. 

Anyway, the way their house was arranged, the great room/kitchen was in the back of the house (it was a two-story) and the living area was at the front, a stairway separating them. I had heard what sounded like rattling, and got up to look out the window, thinking my sister-in-law was home and needed help carrying in bags, but found nothing, so I unlocked the door because my husband, brother, and sister-in-law were due home shortly.

 I was in the great room, watching television, and holding my sleeping baby when I heard something almost like a scream.   I happened to be watching a scary movie, so thought maybe I had just thought I heard something in the background of the movie and had not, in fact, heard anything real, so I ignored it and went back to my movie.

Less than a half-hour later, my brother and husband walk in the front door with my sister-in-law right behind. Followed by the sound of a ton of sirens screaming down their road. (Their neighborhood was wooded and they lived on a dead-end, so something was clearly going on).  

My brother starts talking really fast that he and my husband had pulled up to overhear his next-door neighboor on his phone out front, covered in blood talking to 911 saying ""they are both dead, hurry"".  He said he then proceeded to get off the phone and dry-heave on his sidewalk not more than 50 feet from my brother and husband. 

After a good hour or two we found out that while that during the time when I heard the rustling sound out my front window and then what sounded like a scream, someone had walked into the neighbor's house and had violently murdered the wife of my brother's neighbor and her step-son, who was only 9/10 at the time. The husband had come home from work to find their mutilated bodies and a scene that would make any horror movie seem fake strewn through his house. 

The following information is inside police knowledge we found out from a detective working the case who happened to know my brother and is graphic to some extent:

Apparently, the unknown killer had tried their door and found it unlocked and went into their home. Once inside, he went upstairs and found the step-mom, Chyna in the master bedroom putting clothes away. The step-son was down the hall in his room. The murderer then proceeded to use some form of a knife to basically start slashing and hacking at Chyna spraying her blood all over the room and down the hall as she tried to escape. They believe she must have yelled for her step-son to run and call the police because they found him near the front entry of the house. When the father got home what he found was his wife's body near the bottom of the stairs, a blood trail, and some of her organs strewn from the master bedroom upstairs down the hall and downt he stairs, with her hand prints on the step-son's doorway and in a manner like she was reaching out for help. The son was found in the entry, having been trying to escape, he was missing fingernails from digging them into the flooring;blood was everywhere. The front door was not totally ajar, but slightly opened with the young childs hand-print, as if he had almost made it outside before the killer reached him.  In addition the investigators said that the wife had been molested in a violent manner with what was believed to be a broom stick.  Also, my brother kept a small pop-up camper outside and in addition to the knife used to stab the victims, the chunk of 2x4 that was behind the campers wheel was used to bludgeon the two of them and left in the house, covered in their blood.  

The police speculate, because of the noises I heard, that the killer had first tried my brother's door, hearing the television on, but found it locked and so walked past his camper (the wheels with the wood were closest tot he garage) and picked up the chunk of wood while walking next door. That door was unlocked and murder ensued.

I had nightmares and couldn't sleep for weeks, along with the media being camped outside our house and the neighbors for well over a month. They never found out who killed them, or really any evidence that was useable to find who killed them, and I believe, had I walked in and unlocked that door even minutes earlier than I chose to, it would have been myself and my infant that were murdered.

Still scares the shit out of me when I think of it. 

Edit: I had a couple people question whether the man was outside when he called 911 or inside by his son, as one of the local media outlets reported. I can say quite certainly that he was in face outside because I stood watching the whole thing from my porch which was only from my yard to his right next door. One other poster did include a link to a memorial page created by Chyna's mom which has numerous articles with quotes from others backing up what I say. 

Also, there was a lot of speculation about whether her husband was involved in any of it because earlier in the day I had left to run an errand and saw him drive by me on what should have been his lunch, but when the police checked his work he never chekced out for lunch, and when I returned from my errand less than 20 minutes later he was leaving his driveway and waved at me. Also, his reaction after his initial bought of throwing up and calling 911 was very odd for someone who family was murdered. There is rumor that the police had evidence of his involvement but because of the lack of murders in the area, ever, that they botched the evidence and couldn't use it. I do NOT know if that is true or not, just hearsay. Anyway, if anyone has questions regarding any of the details, what it was like after and for how media and police, etc were around feel free to PM me, I will gladly answer any questions. It was a scary thing and very, very sad."	t5_2t3t8	True
1356828511.0	15ne6v	"""This was not in the job description when I started."""	babyhugbears	483	99	71	"I have decided to share my story with you. This took place in March/April of 2009. I had just started working at Wal-mart in the Hardware department. As a female, I knew little about Hardware, but they didn't seem to care. I spent most of my time stocking, pointing customers to the right aisle, or mixing paint. I rarely knew anything when it came to answering handy-man work. Also note, I was about 23 at the time. I am 5'0 and at the time, weighed about 110 pounds. 

It started the first Saturday I ever worked there. I had the early morning shift, starting at 7am. It was pretty quiet and sleepy, and I had zero customers for a good hour straight. I was also working with another coworker, Ron, who had started the same day as me. 

A man came in looking for a few different items. He was an Indian man (said he was from India, at least) who was either in his late 30s or early 40s. He hovered over me, maybe around 6'3 or so. Decently buffed guy. He was also wearing a spring jacket with it's collar turned up and a baseball cap. 

He completely bypassed Ron and went straight to me for help. I showed him to the products he was requesting when the questions started. I answered politely with a standard, ""I'm not qualified to answer that. I can ask my coworker if he has any thoughts or ideas."" He wouldn't let me however; instead he dragged me to the furthest aisle in our department. Far away from Ron. 

He started spouting off random stuff he was trying to do around his house, asking me what I thought might work best for his needs. I really had  no idea, so I just pointed out random things because he didn't seem interested in having decent help. While I was talking, with my back to him looking at different products, that's when I felt him creep up behind me and grab my ass. In my mind, I tried to play it off as an accident. Until he did it two more times, as well as brush my chest at least 3 times. 

I kept inching away as best as I could, while still trying to do my customer service thing. I was finally saved when Ron came up and asked if we could switch customers because he had a customer who needed paint mixed. (He wasn't taught how to do that yet.) The man left about two seconds after that. I told Ron what had happened, and he agreed to keep an eye out for him. If he were to come back, Ron would help him out. But we didn't see him again that day. 

I worked the same shift the next day, but this time alone. The man came back. I spent about a hour trying to dodge his hands. At one point I was bending down to pick something up and he snuck up in front of me. He had a boner going! I was obviously trying not to look at it nor would I admit that I did. But he must of known I saw it, since his crotch was right in front of my face. 

""Do you like what you see?"" he asked. 

""Um. I...have...to go get something from the stock room."" And I darted off. 

I took that time to talk to a manager about this man. I was clearly upset by him, and I figured the store had to value their employees somewhat. I must have talked to the wrong manager. I talked to my area's manager, Christina, and she basically told me to suck it up and deal with it. ""Customer satisfaction is our number one goal."" I didn't realize I had to satisfy them that way!

I never saw him on the weekdays, but once Saturday rolled around he was there again. I was with my supervisor, Matt,  that day, but he had a meeting in the morning to attend. So I was basically alone in the department. The man dragged me to the tool aisle because he wanted a new hammer and nails so he could build a bird house. 

The grabbing and brushing started up again, and I must of looked clearly uncomfortable. Another male customer came up and asked me if everything was okay. My creeper darted out of the store quick. The other customer, who introduced himself as David, asked me what was going on. I wasn't comfortable telling him my story, I didn't know him. But he asked me if the creeper was harassing me during store hours, and I just gave a slight nod. 

David walked off, but about 10 minutes later he was back, trailed by two other people. My co-manager, Eric, and the head of AP (LP in other stores), Bobby. David explained to the two what he witnessed, how wrong it was for Wal-mart to let this happen, and demanded they rectify the situation before I was hurt. 

Eric thanked David and him and Bobby pulled me into the office. Eric did all the talking. 

""Is this true?""

""Yes...""

""How long has it been going on?""

""He started last Saturday and came back Sunday. I didn't see him again until today.""

""Why didn't you tell anyone before? Why did a customer bring it to management's attention?""

""I tried. I told Christina. She told me to get over it and help the guy no matter what.""

Neither of them looked happy at that.
""Could you point him out on the security footage?""

""Sure.""

So I went in the AP room with them. We rewinded the tapes and I pointed him out from that day. Only problem was, with the baseball cap and collar up jacket, you couldn't see his face. And he purposely kept his head down to avoid being seen on the cameras. I described what he looked like to them, and Bobby said he would warn all his AP peeps. 

I worked the next day again, Sunday. Our department kept getting phone calls, but everytime someone answered the caller would hang up. When I finally answered, it was the creeper. ""Oh good, you are there. I'm on my way. I'm taking you out to lunch. No ifs, ands, or buts about it you sexy girl."" I let out an eek! and hung up the phone on him. 

However, I did call Eric and Bobby and let them know what was said. Both of them showed up in street clothes, as well as another AP guy. They stationed themselves in each of aisles, and let me know the police were already called and on their way. About 5 minutes later, the creeper showed up. He literally ripped me away from another lady I was helping at the moment, and tried dragging me to the exit in the tire center. 

Eric and Bobby tackled him to the ground and the police were there about a minute later. He was arrested and banned from the store. From what I was told, he had outstayed his visa or something and was being deported back to India. I never saw him again, and my nightmare was over. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1345226856.0	ydz92	We've already cut off one of her fingers.	pipian	438	65	47	"Here is another of my stories from when I lived in Mexico City. This time I myself am the protagonist. This happened when I was 18 years old, during the summer before I moved to the US for college. I spent that summer hanging out with my friends, partying, drinking and the like, it was very fun.

After one of those nights of heavy drinking, I woke up in my buddy's house at around noon and headed straight home. I had a pounding headache and the sun's hard rays blurred my vision, dazzled me as I got off the bus and walked the few blocks between the bus stop and my house. No one was home except our maid, Carmen (maids are a lot cheaper more common for middle class families in Mexico). I entered and lied down on the first couch I saw. I started drifting into Morpheus' embrace when I was woken up by the phone ringing. Carmen answered, and about a minute later came to give me the phone. I could see in her eyes that something was not right. Her hand was shaking as she handed me the handset. ""I think someone has La Señora..."" she said in a tiny voice. ""What?"" I said, incredulous as I put the phone to my ear. 

On the line was a woman screaming in agony. I couldn't understand what she was saying, she was mostly screaming and crying and something about a finger, and all I could think was ""fuck. They've got my mom."" The woman's screams stopped and suddenly a man was on the line, who said in a threateningly calm voice: ""We've got your mom. We've already cut off one of her fingers."" At this point my vision became all black with rage and anguish, and I started to lose my grip on reality. Do you guys have any idea how it feels like to know that your mother, the woman who has been there for you all your life, is being tortured in some dark room somewhere in the largest city in the world? I hope you never find out. 

The man demanded money, and I didn't have any. I frantically searched my parent's bedroom for a hidden stash of cash, anything. The guy kept saying that he would kill her if I didn't have any, and I kept pleading to the man to wait until my father gets home, he has money. At that point, I was in tears, living some of the worst moments of my life, when all of a sudden I heard the door of the house open, and with unfathomable relief, I heard the sweet, angelic voice of my mother as she yelled at my dad to grab something from the car. I ran downstairs and hugged her so hard. ""What happened? How did you escape?"" I yelled ""Chinga tu madre puto!"" into the handset and hung up. The guy tried calling again right away but we just hung up.

Turns out I was the victim of a scam that had just become common in Mexico where people would call random phones and pretend to have kidnapped a family member. They ask for you to meet them somewhere immediately and bring cash for ransom, saying they will kill or keep torturing the victim until you give them what they want. A lot of people, like myself, get so freaked out and confused that they don't think it through, and just end up giving away their cash.

Right. 
Well, for some background, I was 11 years old. I used to randomly get up in the middle of the night to get water. I am diabetic so, yeah. You tend to drink more if you're diabetic. (For those who don't know.)
So here I am, one night, getting up at... 1:00ish? Oh and I forgot to say. I have bit sliding door windows in my kitchen, which is connected to the Dining Room. Here it is: http://imgur.com/lyChqbx
So I walk past the Island and then past the oven to get to the sink. I fill my glass up, in the dark, and suddenly, I hear a knock on the glass.
I turn around and there is a guy that looks like this outside the glass: http://imgur.com/Yb7vcYD
I stare at him. I have no idea what to do. Thank god those doors were locked! He makes a thumbs up sign at me. I'm still staring.
Y'know when mimes pretend to pull a really heavy rope towards them? He was doing that. I don't move at all. He does another thumbs up sign and points down at the handle we use to open and unlock the door. He does another thumbs up sign. 

I start to walk towards the door, which you may think was stupid. He looks very very pleased, and does another very big thumbs up sign. He  thinks i'm going to open the door. But no, I am just going to take the key out of the keyhole (the door was locked) because he could break the glass and unlock the door. I take the key out, slowly put my glass of water back on the table and in a flash I ran up the stairs and told my dad. He came charging down the stairs to find the guy was gone. He tells me off softly, telling me not to get up at night again. 
I thought that was the end of it. Apparently not.
The next night, I went down again and guess who was there? THE MIME. 

He waves, and gestures for me to come over again. I shake my head. He makes a sad face and wipes his eyes like a baby. I go back upstairs to my room again and struggle to sleep.

**THIRD NIGHT**
I come down again. He's there. This time, he blows me a kiss as I come down. I frown at him. He scratches his head, like he didn't even know why I was upset. I shake my head, again. This time he puts his hands on his hips and points his finger at me like he's telling me off. Imitating my dad, He walks round in a circle and uses his arms to imply like he's reasoning with me. I am crying at this point. I run back upstairs and jump onto my bed, crying. 

For months he would come round and try to get me to open the door. When I turned 12, I started bringing a drink upstairs with me as I went to bed. The one time I did go down after I started doing that. I walked down and the dude was *jacking off* in front of the window. I stare in horror. Suddenly, white stuff comes out of his crown jewel and onto the window. He points at me, then the crown jewel, and then he gets a lollipop that was *the same that me and my sister bought at the shop that day, same colour and everything!* and starts sucking it. 
I run upstairs. Repeating that this guy was sick sick sick and I hate hate hate hate hate him! 

That was the last time I saw him. I DID try to tell people, but they never believed me. Thanks for reading, it means alot."	t5_2t3t8	True
1340209107.0	vc197	The Woman Singing At Night	AverageDoorknob	418	44	65	"I posted my story as a response to an AskReddit thread, and was told I should post it here. So here it is.

Growing up, I always wanted to go on a bike ride at night, something about it seemed really cool to me. It wasn't until I was 13 that my mom finally let me. She told me to wear my helmet, have my phone, take a flashlight, and she set the parameters for where I was allowed to go. She gave me about 4 miles, which was a lot to me. So right after the sun set, I was off.

I loved it. There were no people out walking their dogs, no kids running around, the temperature was perfect, etc.. It was really fun, so fun, that I ignored the limits my mom set. You see, where I was biking was all walking paths. It was one of those grassy areas between two neighborhoods. There's this long path that went at least 600 feet at a 25 degree angle. I was flying down this hill, having an absolute blast, and darted right through the parameters.

My mom set these limits for a reason. Everything on the inside was close to houses and people. The outside, more specifically, the place where the path I was on lead to, was barren. I rode along this path for 10 minutes before I could only see some of the lights of the houses on the inside of the limits.

After 15 minutes of riding along this dirt path, I hear singing. It sounded about 30-40 feet in front of me. I stop riding to hear it better. It was a woman's voice. She was singing Eleanor Rigby by The Beatles. But she wasn't singing the words, just the melody of the vocals. Her voice was strange. You know how when you have phlegm in your throat, your voice gets scratchy? That's what her voice sounded like.

I inch forward to try and see her. I get close enough to see the silhouette of hair bouncing up and down, like she was headbanging. I decide to get my flashlight out. I'm thinking that maybe this person is in need of help or something. Or maybe this is an insane person and the light will scare them away. So I take the flashlight out of my pocket, point it at her, and turn it on.

The moment the light hit her, she stopped moving completely. She was facing away from me. She had disgusting hair that seemed to be sticking together in clumps. Some of her hair was ripped off, too. She was wearing a very over-sized, bright red hoodie. I was almost too scared to move. I think she was, too. I conjured up as much bravery as I could and said ""Sorry"" in a very, oops-this-is-the-wrong-room, kind of way. She didn't respond.

I turned off the flashlight and put it back in my pocket. Just as I was turning my bike around, she screams. She screams in an awful, awful, high pitched voice. I damn near shit myself as I throw myself back onto my bike. I hear her voice getting closer to me. I book it as fast as I can. I don't look behind me, and I don't stop pedaling. Her screaming grew quieter and quieter until it dissolved into the howling of the wind."	t5_2t3t8	True
1372265741.0	1h49fj	The creeper that followed me home from the hospital...	FreeeeakedOut	433	59	63	"I'm a female in my mid twenties and I work in my local hospital. 
This happened last week when I finished my shift in the evening (8pm), it was still light outside and I decided to walk the 20 minutes home. Whenever I'm walking I tend to listen to music on my iPod and just zone out (not the safest idea I know, but most of us do it). 

A few minutes into my walk I have to cross a bridge over the motorway, as you walk up the slope to the bridge there is a small wooded area on either side of you. 
I could feel something or someone around me, so I casually stopped my music and had a look around me. Nothing was out of place, and I thought maybe it was me being overly sensitive. 
I kept the music off though, just in case and carried on walking. 
A few seconds later I heard rustling behind me, and turned around startled, again nothing was there. At this point my heart is racing but I'm trying to convince myself I'm being paranoid. I get to the top of the bridge and am now out in the open and can see all around so am feeling a lot better.

 Ten minutes later and I'm nearing home and am laughing to myself about how silly and paranoid I was. At this point I'm as relaxed as I can be, and my music is back on and am just enjoying winding down from work. I've now just reached the top of the park which sits opposite my road, and am all perked up as I'm nearly home. 

I looked behind me (I hadn't heard anything, or really sensed anything to my knowledge but I'm very thankful I did look) and saw a guy about 3ft behind me. He was that close. This guy was tall, skinny, and had greasy black hair that hung around his face. He was dressed all in black. 
The creepiest part was that he looked dead behind the eyes. He was staring directly at me and there was nothing there. Just blank.

I turned back round and started walking at speed down the park, hoping that I was just being silly. I contemplated rummaging in my bag for my phone to call the police but didn't want to slow myself down and still at this point wondered if I was mis-reading the situation. 

The creeper carried on following me, and although wasn't as close as 3ft anymore had still significantly kept up speed. Every time I looked behind me he was staring directly at me, still no emotion, still completely dead behind the eyes. I contemplated heading somewhere else and trying to lose him but at this point I was terrified and just wanted to get to the safety of my house.
As my house came into view I decided to just run for it (which I should've done sooner evidently), as I looked behind me I noticed the creeper wasn't running after me, but still just walking fast and staring at me.

I got to my door and rummaged through my bag for my keys, completely aware that any moment now the creeper could've caught up. I grabbed them and hurriedly let myself into the house when he was 15ft away. I slammed &amp; locked the door behind me, and then ran up the stairs. 

The front door has glass panels, and our living room area has big glass doors facing the back garden - I didn't want him to be able to see me. I was shaking like mad as I edged up the stairs, and looked out of our stairs window. He was nowhere to be seen. I went upstairs and looked out of the bedroom window to get a better view of the front garden, and I couldn't see him. 
I thought he'd gone. With my heart still racing I got my phone out of my bag and headed downstairs to call the non emergency number. 

As I walked into my living room his face was pressed up against the glass peering into my house and we made eye contact. Dead eyes again. I let out quite the scream and ran back upstairs. I called the emergency number. 
As I waited for the police the creeper had taken a seat in my garden, cross legged, just staring at the house. 

The police came within ten minutes and picked him up, he went without any struggle. The policewoman that came told me he'd told them ""I was just waiting for her"". Shudder.

Turns out creeper is an in patient in the psychiatric ward of my hospital. From what I've found out since he'd had a bit of a fascination with me from seeing me around the hospital doing my job. Some people I know in the psychiatry unit tell me he'd been mentioning his ""girlfriend"" recently &amp; they all thought it was another patient. They now think he was talking about me. 
He's been moved to another hospital now, somewhere where he can recover and I won't be afraid to go to work. And I'm hoping he doesn't have the freedom to just leave as and when he wants if he plans on creeping on hospital staff.
I do hope he gets better, but I'm finding it hard to have warm wishes for him when he terrified me as much as he did.  

I will definitely be catching the bus from now on.

1354119788.0	13xt94	Creepy guy moves into my former neighbor's house. Spies on me through his basement windows while I mow lawns.  Turns out he had a dead woman in his freezer!	YourWebcamIsOn	439	81	32	"When I was about 13 this nice family moved out of their house in the Prescott Country Club (Dewey, AZ), just down the block from my family.  A strange guy moved in and the condition of the property rapidly deteriorated.  The day he moved in he had a large U-Haul type truck, which was fine, but the thing never left.  It stayed parked in the driveway!  It also had an extension cord running from the house out to the truck.  I thought that was weird.
Eventually, there were paint cans all over the yard, random junk on the side of the house, a real mess.  This was not welcome in the small community but anybody who talked to the guy came away saying the dude was a weird and they needed to tread lightly.

I mowed lawns and was hired to do our friends lawn while they were on an extended vacation, they lived next to this weird guy.  Every day when I was sweating my ass off mowing, I could see this weirdo spying on me through his blinds in his living room...he wasn't very good at hiding it.  Every. Day.  I kept looking back at him and giving him weird looks, hoping he'd knock it off.

Well fast forward 2 years and my family is watching the 5PM news while we eat dinner and they start reporting on a developing case where a woman's frozen body was found inside in a freezer inside a Ryder truck.  They showed the house and we all went silent and stopped chewing.  I ran outside and looked down the street, and sure enough, every news agency in the state had a truck parked in the street, satellite dishes extended, cops had everything cordoned off.

This guy had abducted a 23-year old woman on a Los Angeles freeway, raped, murdered and then stored her dead body in a freezer, which eventually went into the truck and was driven to AZ, where he moved next door to his mother. Who of course had no idea.

1365108051.0	1bop41	Long time friend arrested for child pornography.	DeathAndTheGirl	438	73	51	"When I was thirteen years old, my parents got the internet for the first time. Being homeschooled, I particularly liked the option to talking to more kids my age. I actually have some friends still that I've met then and still keep in contact with.

I had one friend in particular who I met at a community website, he was a year younger than myself and lived about 4 hours away. After talking online for months, webcaming etc, my parents allowed him to call me on our land line. We were very close,and he called me almost every night. 

He was very odd, and I began to suspect that perhaps he had aspergers syndrome. This was later proven to be correct, along with a few other minor disorders. It took a lot to decipher what he meant when he spoke, but because we spoke so frequently, I got used to this. We sent each other art work, and even friendship bracelets. But we never met in person. 

As time went on, we began to lose contact. I had moved out of my parent's house, and didn't have a computer. He didn't have a cellphone or landline, so I couldn't call/text. He lived off of state aid in an efficiency apartment. We would only email once in awhile, but few and far between. 

At some point, his older sister added me on Facebook. He had an account, but was never really active. She added me because I was the only non-family member he had, and she also had difficulty keeping in contact with him. I had no other information to give her, but her and I began a good friendship and still text regularly. She told me a lot that surprised and saddened me. Namely that he suffered a lot of physical and sexual abuse from their stepfather. (She found out years later) This added to the mental instability he had, obviously. 

Then, out of the blue, I was sitting in the office at work, and while doing my duties, was also on Facebook. He signed in, and we IMed for a few hours. We hadn't spoken much in the past two years, so we caught up. I told him where I was working and living, my gf and I had gotten our own place, etc. He had lost his state aid and was living with his grandmother. I gave him my cell number, but he said he didn't have a cell phone. 

About two months later, I was on a break outside of work, having a cigarette. I saw a tall, lanky man walking around across the street. My first thought was he was homeless, which is odd, because we have a very low homeless rate in my city, and many shelters. He stuck out to me, his clothes were dark and tattered, his hard long and dark. Something in my gut told me it was my friend. I hadn't seen a picture of him since he was about 15, which was nearly 8 years ago. Eventually this man wandered into my store, about a half hour later. He avoided eye contact, and wandered around. He carried a jug of water, and a backpack. He didn't approach me and just smiled when I offered assistance. 

However, when he heard me answer the phone, which I assume was him confirming that it was me, (""thanks for calling so&amp;so, this is Rachel, how may I help?"") After I confronted him and we spoke, I was able to gauge that he had decided to travel and stopped here, in-between. He didn't tell me his final destination, but I knew he didn't know anyone else in my city, and relied on my good breeding and hospitality to put him up for the night. I called and confirmed this would be fine with my gf, who said she'd trust my opinion. 

We showed him around the city, and even bought him food,(he wanted an apple pie. Which he ate with a fork, on the couch. All of it, right out of the container.) and even later showed him to a casino. He wanted to leave because there were too many cameras. We both acknowledged this was odd, but assumed it was a part of one of his disorders and complied.

We set him up on the couch, and hung out a bit before bed. I even washed his clothes, while he borrowed pajamas and let him shower. (This was more of an insistence, because it was a hot day, and I guess he walked all over until he found my job while NOT wearing any deodorant. He wasn't gonna stink up my couch,man.) My g.f casually asked what he had in his pack back. She worried for his safety as he eluded he'd be hitchhiking and traveling by foot, and hoped he had the right supplies. He showed us what was in his backpack. Art supplies, some rope. Fingernail clippers. A bag of his own hair. (You read that right.) And a gallon of olive oil that he planned on drinking. (Read that right, too.) 

Later in bed, my gf had told me she'd be getting up earlier than we had originally planned, to take him to the library as he requested. She said she wanted him out of the house asap. I was surprised because we both had admitted he was weird as shit, and I was still in shock of meeting someone out of the blue that I had only known online for so many years. 
She then informed me that while I was switching the wash around, he told her the FBI had confiscated his computer due to some things they found. He said he was working through a dark time, and thought he had fixed it. But when he got his computer back,(when he initially contacted me) he fell back into his old ways. My gf immediately knew what he was saying.

So we woke early, and told him the change in schedule because we were called into work. He didn't sleep on the couch, but instead between the coffee table and couch, wrapped like a burrito and face down. 

I later found out from his sister that night when I called her to tell her about these events, that he had his computer confiscated for child pornography, and had skipped town when there was a warrant out for his arrest. I called my local police department and they took a statement. 

No one knew where he was until last month, when he called me. I answered the unknown number, and we spoke for a half hour. I quickly found out where he was and spent the time trying to gather more information while cussing him out for using me and lying to me. He said he tried to look at it to see if he'd end up like his father, and it, ""didn't excite him in ways that they think,"" and that he was embarrassed and scared. I told him he needed to turn himself in, and not to call me again. (They don't confiscate your computer if you just looked once. This was continual use and downloading. Suffice to say, if he didn't like it, he wouldn't have had so much.)

We just let one guy that we know from our church move in. He's a smart man, around 35 years old. He has his bachelors in engineering and is currently getting his masters. I take my high-school classes at a college building, the same place that he goes to college for. He has a mental disability, nothing too severe. If he's on his medication, he's usually fine, but sometimes he refuses to take them. It's about 2:00 AM when he knocks on our door (Note that my parents are on a road trip 5,000+ KM away) and asks for a ride to WSU. We talk for a  little bit when he starts giggling constantly. It's a high pitched, quiet giggle and it's like he knows something I don't. I'm getting quite nervous when I suddenly realize that he's not on his medication. At this point I ask him to leave, and he complies and goes to the basement. A little while later, he comes back up but I check through the blinds when he knocks; I don't answer. I go back to my computer (there's a window right next to it) and finish up my math homework. I look through my bedroom window and he's pressed up against it. His face is contorted into a gruesome smile. I stifle a scream and lock myself in the bathroom. It's 5:30 AM at this point, but I stay in the bathroom till 6:30, when it start getting light outside. I scout the entire house but he's not outside, so I start calming down. I see him the next day, but he's perfectly normal so I stop worrying about it. Fast forward a few days and I'm at school. He comes by the school office and asks what classroom I'm in and if he can talk to me in private. The person managing the office declines, so he goes home in frustration. I'm later told about this in my free period. I'm in constant fear of him going after me again the rest of the day, but when I hop on the bus I feel a little better. Halfway through the ride, I glance out the window and see his mother fucking car driving alongside the bus. This continues till I get to my stop and he pulls up in my driveway. I run straight inside, lock the door and close all the blinds. I watch as he's staring into the window, and then I finally have the nerve to call the police. I'm on the phone with the 911 dispatcher until they arrive. They ask if he's armed, but I can only see his head so I reply that I don't know. The police finally arrive after 20 minutes and he breaks out into a run. He locks himself in our basement shouting for the police to leave. They convince him to come out of his room where they quickly handcuff him and throw him into the back. One of the officers does a quick search of his room and comes across 2 knives, sleeping gas and a loaded glock. My parents were notified and they rushed home quickly. After that, life got back to normal. He's currently sitting in prison for the abduction of a 11 year old boy. This experience scarred me for life and I have developed PTSD and whenever I'm startled, I break out into a cold sweat.

1344110560.0	xolxo	"""We're on the roof!"""	CreepyThrowaway6	430	76	67	"Hi, r/LetsNotMeet! I have been a long time lurker of this subreddit, and have finally decided to tell my story.

Just a little info about me: I'm 26, female, kind of a tomboy; I grew up climbing trees, playing in the dirt. I have never touched a Barbie in my life!

Back in the summer of 2002 (I was 16 at the time), my then boyfriend asked me on a camping trip with him and his parents. Me being the tomboy that I was, graciously accepted. His parents planned out a weekend of us going rafting, boating, swimming -- the works. I was in paradise!

They had an RV, and it was furnished with everything. I slept in the living/kitchen area on a makeshift bed, even though my boyfriend's parents didn't give a fuck where I slept. I did it out of courtesy! (Such a lady ;) ).

Sidenote: We are out in the middle of the woods, a designated camping area. It was so quiet and peaceful. You could hear the river in the stillness of the night. It was soothing. I remember thinking to myself, ""I could live here forever.""

The next day was probably the funnest day of my life. We all went kayaking (which, I have to say... was AWESOME!!!) and we swam and then my boyfriend's dad cooked out. I can't remember the last time I had laughed so much and genuinely enjoyed myself.

It seemed like the day flew by. Before I knew it, it was time for us to go to bed. We had a big day planned for the next day, and I was eager to get to sleep just so I could wake up and do it all over again.

I remember laying awake, though, and just staring at the ceiling. My boyfriend was snoring, and I laughed as quietly as I could. He snored VERY loud. I got one last laugh before, literally, my life was changed forever.

There was a tap on the side of the RV. It caught me off guard, and I wasn't even alarmed. I just thought it was a random noise; you know the ones... a creak here and there, a sound of something settling. Whatever. Bottom line is that I wasn't scared or freaked out. 

I tried to sleep, but I heard another tap, then I heard an unmistakable *giggle*. And I thought maybe my boyfriend's parents were awake and getting some ""adult"" time, and I was thinking to myself, ""Please, God, let me fall asleep soon.""

Silence washed over the place. I hear the river. The ringing in my ears you get when it's dead silent. I had this sinking feeling in my stomach; I hear people say they get it when something bad is about to happen. I felt it at that moment.

In the dead silence, I hear the giggle again, followed by a *scraping* sound coming from outside the RV. My heart jumped into my throat and I felt tears in my eyes (when I get nervous/scared I cry.. lol). 

Someone was outside the RV, but I was literally scared stiff. I couldn't move a muscle, and the scraping sound continued. I whispered for my boyfriend, but he just kept snoring. 

I was laying about five feet away from the main door (although, there are the two doors at the front of the RV, and one emergency one at the back). I kept watching the little square hole in the door, hoping no one would come through.

More silence. My heart is being so fast. I'm afraid I'm going to have a heart attack. I tap my chest to try and calm myself.

As I'm watching the square hole in the door, I see a small, delicate-looking hand almost appear from the darkness. I almost shriek out loud. The hand was of a girl, no doubt. I could see those fake press-ons and know them from any Wal-Mart store.

But that still didn't stop me from almost shitting my pants. I sit up, and I start SCREAMING. And I mean I start WAILING. My boyfriend's parents stagger into the room, and all I can do is point to the door.

Boyfriend's dad goes to open the door, but there's a sudden CRASH, then he falls back inside, falling onto the couch. Out cold. A rock falls onto the floor. 

And that's when boyfriend wakes up, starts shouting. The mom is going insane, tending do her husband. I am screaming still, in shock. Boyfriend is flipping his shit, and I eventually stop screaming.

When I stop screaming, I hear the hysterical laughter from outside, followed by heavy footsteps on top of the RV.

""We're on the roof, we're on the roof!"" I hear a high-pitched, nasally voice tease from outside the RV. None of us had cell phones. It was 2002, and we were just NOW starting to get into the cell phone craze, but we had all magically managed to abstain somehow.

The RV is rocking with someone jumping up and down, then there's a CRASH as someone rams against the door frame. The girl outside is laughing and screaming. She's mocking me (or was; sorry, switching tenses like a mofo). 

The dad manages to sober up, grab a gun from one of the cupboards, and opens the door and fires out into the darkness. The prancing on the roof stops immediately. The girl shrieking outside stops suddenly.

Everything goes silent. 

I turn to look at my boyfriend. There's a window behind him. And I see the face; a hood drawn over his face. I know it was a man because I could make out the outline of a beard on his face, but that was it.

The man raised a gloved hand and waved at me. I pulled my boyfriend away from the window and start screaming. The dad runs inside, asking what's wrong. I look back at the window, the man is gone.

We drove out of the camp site that night with a broken window. My boyfriend's dad went to the hospital with a minor concussion where the rock hit him. (Don't worry, my boyfriend's mom drove.)

The parents called the police the next morning and officers went out and searched the area. They didn't find anything. No other reports were ever filed after us.

I had to go through counseling and therapy, because I had trouble sleeping for about two years after it. My boyfriend and I broke up due to the stress I was going through from it, actually. 

Eventually, I started getting better. Then, while I was in university, some girlfriend and I decide to go to the movies. There was a new one out called *The Strangers*. I decided to go, because I had no homework. Turns out it was scarily like the experience I went through, and I ended up having a panic attack in the middle of the theater and had to go to the hospital.

A few months after THAT, I read a newspaper article where a woman was arrested at a campsite (not too far away from where my boyfriend and his parents were that summer) for vandalizing some tents and RVs. I don't know if it was the same girl. It didn't show her picture, but it made me wonder.

As of 2012, I no longer go to therapy or have nightmares, but I do own several different types of guns, and if you knock on my door in the middle of the night, you better have a damn good explanation as to why you're there. Also, stay the fuck off my roof.

Thanks for being here, reddit. :]

1374700682.0	1izen6	"""Come on baby girl, I've got some cookies for your nice booty"""	olgaslam	439	79	59	"Down the street from my house is a man who I've been scared of for quite a long time, since he just looked scary and had a big scary truck. Anyways, today I was working outside when I noticed he kept driving by slowly. After the 4th drive by, I finally watched him drive by my house rather than just seeing it out of the corner of my eye. 

He was watching me too, which really scared me, then he slowed down even more and said ""you've got a nice booty, baby"" and he smiled a really creepy smile. 

Later, when I was back inside I heard a knock at my door. I tried to look out my front window but whoever it was was too close to the door to see who it was. So I opened it a crack, and it was the guy from earlier. Terrified, I closed the door and locked it. 

I then heard him shout out ""come on baby girl, I've got some cookies for your nice booty."" 
I waited for him to leave, which took way too long. He kept knocking and saying different variations of ""come on, baby, open the door""

He finally left, and I thought I was free. 
I left the living room to go to the bathroom, and my bathroom is right by my back door. 

There he was, standing at my back door. In a panic, I locked it and ducked. 
""I know you're in there"" he said.  
I quickly jumped up and opened the curtain and told him I'm going to call the police of he doesn't get the fuck off of my property, and he quickly and finally left for good. 

He didn't even have any god damn cookies.

**July 25 10:31 PM EDIT:** I notified the police earlier today. My dad went to the guys house but he wasn't there, but hasn't been at home since I called. I don't know if the cops took him somewhere or he's staying away from his house, but at least the police know.

1366287104.0	1clncl	Peeping Tom Watching My Sister, Mom and Me Naked for Months		401	54	35	"When I was 12, I lived with my 14 year old sister and our mother in a house on an acre and a half of land.  This neighborhood consisted of homes on large properties and was fairly dark, with no street lamps and many dirt roads.  Basically, we lived in the middle of nowhere.  Because of this, a few of the rooms in our home including the laundry room, kitchen, and a storage room weren't covered with blinds since no one could see in from the street.  Our laundry room was where we kept most of our clothes, as we were often too lazy to put away our clean clothes.  We were also a very open family, so we walked around in various states of undress regularly, sometimes just underwear and a sports bra.  After showers we always walked in to the laundry room to get dressed.  The laundry room was also where the family computer was, so it was a highly trafficked room.

During a particularly rainy season, my mother noticed large shoe prints, likely belonging to a male, around the perimeter of our home as well as through our yard.  We were all freaked out but there really wasn't much the police could do aside from occasionally patrol the area.  We forgot about the foot prints over the next few weeks and didn't think much of aside from locking all doors and windows.  One night I was standing in the laundry room arguing with my sister about who got to use the computer when 
I thought I saw a face against the window, watching us.  We screamed for our mother and she ran outside with a flashlight, but by the time she was outside she could only hear the rustling of bushes as someone ran into the woods.  The next day there were obvious large hand prints against the outside window.  The police were contacted but not much could be done to identify the guy.

My mother ordered blinds to be installed and we hid from the laundry room, completely creeped out that someone could be watching us.  The day before the installation, sometime around dusk, my mother was doing laundry and caught the face of someone she recognized to be a neighbor catty-corner to us that had a husky.   She wasn't 100% that it was him, but he had pretty distinguishable moles on his face.  The police were contacted, and I'm not entirely sure what came of that situation, but I don't know if there was enough evidence to really hold him accountable.

Throughout my teenage years I saw this neighbor often, usually in the mornings while I waited for the school bus.  He would walk past, wave hi, and then walk away.  I often caught him turning around to stare at me when he thought I wasn't looking, which makes me cringe because I always felt as though he was remembering me in my underwear.  During my senior year in highschool, I was able to borrow a car to drive to school so I no longer had to ride the bus.  On my last day waiting for the school bus, the man walked by with his husky and said hello.  I turned to him and said ""All those years ago, I knew it was you.""  He froze for a moment, looked surprised, then got a smirk on his face and said ""I thought so.""  He continued to walk his dog down the street, smiling.

I live  in one of the largest cities in the world. It has a reputation for being scary, but I can honestly say nothing intimidating has ever happened to me there. Sure, you get people who are creepy, or crazy, or cat-call, but that just makes you a pro at the counter-glare of 'Not Dealing With Your Shit Today, Thank you'. I've walked through some *bad* nieghborhoods at 2 a.m. and been aware, but not scared. I've been on the subway with That Creepy Guy. Yeah, *that* Creepy Guy. The one with the staring problem and bottomless pockets. I've gotten used to it. I think this might be why I reacted the way I did the *only* time anything sketchy has happened to me. In suburbia.  On a sunny afternoon. At 24 years old.


So, I was heading back to the suburbs to visit my parents. It was around 3:30ish- maybe 4p.m. and I was lugging a back-pack full of laundry that I'd be blissfully washing, free of charge and without some bastard dumping it still- wet on the Laundromat floor because he needed the big dryer.  I was *not* looking my best (laundry day, after all) and was wearing a hoodie and jeans with my hair up in a pony-tail. I swear this is important. 


I'm about a block away from my house when a car pulls up next to/slightly behind me. Figuring the person needs directions I don't think anything of.  The guy is still rolling slightly when he calls out of his window.


""Get in the car. I'll give you a ride home. Get in.""


Now, I barely know anyone in my home town and I *absolutely* don't recognize his voice. So I spin at him thinking it's just the world's most optimistic cat-call- and (my voice not being soft at the best of times) kinda bellow,


""What? Are you kidding me?""


The guy's eyes get *wide* and he flinches hugely. At this point I'm still partly confused as to how some dude thinks a grown-ass woman is going to to get into his car for a ride.  I mean really what...


And then I realize what time it is. School just got out. And that I'm carrying a back-pack. And wearing what's basically the universal uniform of every teenage girl in my area.  And he only saw me from behind when he started talking to me. Ooooh.  Now I understand.


""Mother*FUCKER*! What did you just say to me? Did you just tell me to get in your fucking car?""


"" Nothing.  I didn't say anything"" He thinks for a second. Then, compelled I guess, by vast stupidity and a desperate need to be in control of the situation, says;"" Don't swear at me."" 


I *swear to god*. The creeper trying get teenage girls into his car told me to watch my language. At this point I'm obviously fairly livid. 


""WHAT? Fuck YOU!  What's your name, man? What do you think you're doing? "" He's wearing a hat and tries to pull the brim down-  he somehow forgot to wear his Creepy Sexual Predator Aviators that day- and starts yelling at me to get the hell *away* from his car. Ah, irony. At this point he remembers that he's *in* a car and tries to peel off... Just as someone is pulling out of their drive- so I jog after him to where he's stopped. 

""HEY! Mr. Gray Mother-Fucking Honda Accord. I got your license number, fuckhead!"" 

The other driver has paused at this point to look at the angry shouting girl, making Mr. Mother-Fucking Honda Accord drive *around* them into the oncoming lane where he nearly drives smack into another car, manages to avoid a head-on collision, and *burns rubber* down the block,  leaving actual real-life tire tracks. 

So I get home and call the cops with his car, license number, physical description and which way he was heading. Apparently they were already on the lookout for him- he'd been trying this in all the neighboring towns, though nobody was stupid enough to get into his car- but they didn't have a license plate.

1376081582.0	1k1t7g	Why I Love My Dad	FizzyLemon	420	73	22	"When I was about 15 or so, my family was invited to a wedding out of town. I was super excited to get dressed up and see my friends who lived in the area. The wedding was great, but for whatever reason (maybe work?) my dad decided we should drive back that night. We all complained that we were tired and just wanted to crash at my grandparent's place but he was adamant so we headed home. 

For whatever reason we had taken two cars. I think my dad met us down there, so he had his truck and my brother rode with him. I was in the van with my mom and my sister. 

Around 12:30 or 1:00am my dad calls my mom and says he needs to stop for gas. They discuss the closest station and agree it's in a not-so-nice part of Palm Beach county. Kind of this weird ghetto strip that runs between it and Boca. My dad pulls into the station first and parks at a pump, but my mom's tank is full so she parks the van sort of out of the way and gets out to go buy a cup of coffee and talk to my dad. 

I'm just sitting in the front seat with my sister kind of falling asleep in the middle row of seats when this skinny, greasy looking guy comes around the corner. His teeth were yellow from cigarettes or something worse, and he got this freaky smile on his face when he saw me. I told my sister to grab my phone, call my mom and hide under the small pile of pillows we had in the van. 

""Hey! Hey, you got some change? I need to buy some gas!"" 

I quickly pretend that I'm deaf and sign whatever I know (I hadn't been learning very long) so I'm throwing out things like ""Cookie tomorrow mom dad bear play"". The guy comes up to the window and starts knocking on it, then motioning for me to roll down the windows or unlock the door. Honestly I don't know what the hell he was thinking. 

My sister is hiding under her makeshift shield and I can hear her finally connect on the cellphone just as the guy TRIES THE FUCKING DOOR OF THE VAN. I just scream, ""DADDY"" and around the pump comes my dad, wrench in one hand and phone in the other. 

Now, my dad is a big guy. He's close to 6' 5"" and he's built like a tank. My friends joke that he looks like a mafia boss or something. I only hope that creep was pissing himself when my dad comes around the pump and says, ""Is there a problem here?"" 

The guy instantly jumped away from the van and put his hands up. He tried stammering out that he just needed some money for gas until my dad came even closer and said, ""So you felt the need to ask this young lady when I'm RIGHT over there?"" 

The guy booked it. 

I don't know if he was homeless or crazy or both, but I'm glad I've got my dad."	t5_2t3t8	True
1369688832.0	1f5psy	Not sure if this is creepy enough, but it definitely freaked me out. Maybe I'm just paranoid.	embracethehate	402	52	40	"So this happened a while back, when my daughter was about 20 months old. We went to the mall and since it's hard to get much shopping done with a toddler, we were mostly just window shopping and using it as an excuse to get out for a bit. Our mall has a play area near the food court. Just gigantic versions of children's toys that kids can climb on and whatnot. So I let my daughter out of her stroller so she could go burn off some energy and then I found a seat near the entrance to the play area and watched her. A friend of mine said she might be meeting us there, so I took my phone out and put it in my lap in case she called or texted. A few minutes later, the phone buzzed, and I don't remember what it was for, I just remember looking at it and it wasn't my friend so it was unimportant. This took maybe a few seconds? 

When I looked again to the spot my daughter had been playing, she wasn't there. I didn't panic immediately. I scanned the rest of the area for her. Still didn't see her. Okay, now I was kind of panicking. I don't know how long this moment lasted but it felt like forever. Then I saw a woman walking towards the exit/entrance with a kid in her arms. MY kid. I jumped up and ran up to her and said ""That's my daughter."" She looked slightly startled and just replied ""Oh, I saw her crying and I was looking for her parents."" She hands my daughter back to me. And then she leaves the play area and doesn't return. 

MAYBE I'm paranoid, like I said. But I found it really doubtful that my daughter suddenly started crying in the few seconds I checked my phone. And she didn't look like she had been crying when I got her. She only looked confused as to why this strange lady was holding her. Also later on I realized that it was weird as fuck that the woman was even in the play area when she didn't appear to have any children of her own with her. 

I still think about it and get freaked out by how fast it all happened. "	t5_2t3t8	True

He retired out of the military, so most of my mom's side of the family lived a large portion of their lives on base. One night, my grandma went to the bar with my grandfather.

He had saved me and my brother from bullies a few times, and had quite the reputation of sending people to the hospital because of fights.  One day, he had caught me when i was walking home, i was for some reason walking ahead of my brother and friends, and he said he wanted to talk about rumors I was supposedly spreading.  He said if I tried to run, he would ""F*#$"" me up.  Asked me if i liked videogames,  and told me to tell my brother and friends he was going to give me a game for n64.

To add a little bit, i was carrying a french horn and a heavily loaded backpack.

We got to the house, that supposedly belonged to his friend, and he told me to climb into the boat, as he started climbing over a gate, to ""look for his friend"". Looking back, he was checking if anybody was home, so we would be undisturbed.  The boat I was told to wait in was a sort of small houseboat, had a small deck, and I was told to wait in the cabin.
He told me he wanted me to perform fellatio on him, otherwise he would stab me.  I called his bluff, told him no. I refuse.  He kept asking me if I wanted to be stabbed, and failed to provide a knife. Then changed it to beating me up, and i told him I was used to it, I got bullied on an almost daily basis.  Eventually, his threats changed to making me walk home stark naked if i refused, and i simply said ""no, i will not take anything off.""  He then asked me if i had any money, and if I lied to him, I would be stabbed.  I only had about 7 cents, and pulled it out and showed him.  There were a few moments of silence, and more threats, I started getting a migraine, and started crying because I just wanted to go home.  What felt like an eternity in captivity only turned out to be less than 45 minutes, and I escaped unscathed, untouched, just incredibly shaken.  I ran down the street, carrying my backpack and french horn.  There were police officers all over the place, and when i got to my friend's house, which was about halfway home, his older cousin, who was trying to get into the department as an officer, tried to talk to a few of them, but they were ""busy with another investigation"" and didn't want to help.

Fast forward a year.  After my incident, and another friend of mine he had mugged a few days before, he spent some time in juvenile hall, and came back out, and went on a rape spree, I believe he raped 4 kids, ranging 11-14.

1358655752.0	16wwry	My first - and last - day on the job.	Alexxxie	414	70	26	"Hi guys! This is my first post ever on Reddit! My boyfriend begged me to put this story on here, so I am honoring his wish -- not really sure how I'm supposed to do this, but here goes:

This happened last year, around September. I was given a job at my campus's main dining hall. I was in charge of inventory. It was just a 15-hour-a-week job that I had taken to get a little extra money. It wasn't hard at all. I just counted the amount of plates, cups, misc. food items, etc. After that, I just chilled until my shift ended, which was usually around 10 PM.

It was my first day (or night, actually) on the job. My supervisor was an asshole. He told me what to do, then he went home. He left me there to do the job by myself at around 7 PM. It was already dark. But I did what he said. The place was creepy when it was empty. 

I finished in about 45 minutes. I sat around, bored, in the darkness. I played a few hundred (thousand?) games of Angry Birds. Still had an hour and a half until my shift ended. Fuck. So I did what any good girl would do - I went into the kitchen.

The kitchen area was huge. It wrapped around half of the building, it seemed. I went into the freezer area just to see what was there, and that's when I heard a bang from the front part of the kitchen. It scared me so bad that I slipped and fell (the floor was slick in the freezer). I crawled out - on all fours - to see what the sound was.

When I looked, I didn't see anything but a silent figure darting back and forth in the darkness. I immediately flipped my shit, because the dark figure was bounding toward me. It grew larger and larger, until I jumped up and turned the lights on. 

I was immediately staring into a pair of eyes. It was Roger, one of the cleaning staff members. (My supervisor had mentioned cleaning staff came in later, but Roger was about four hours early.) But I knew Roger. We were both juniors at the time, and I had had a few classes with him. He was a sweetheart, but I think he wasn't all ""there."" He just seemed off, but he always said hello to me, and I to him. 

But I remember asking him, rather brashly, ""why the fuck are you here?"" and he just smiled, laughed, and shrugged. He didn't say words, and I was creeped the fuck out. Then he told me he had heard I had got a job there, and he wanted to ""keep me company.""

I told him I was fine. He didn't leave right away, and I'm not the type of person to be incredibly mean and upfront, so I let him stay. Roger and I ended up talking about our classes and stuff. I realized that he just needed a friend, and I was happy to give him that. But the end of my shift came, and I told Roger that I was leaving. I only had to go down to the basement level and turn off the heating/air unit (which is what people in charge of inventory did as part of closing procedures). Roger said his goodbyes, then left. I went downstairs without thinking about it.

Later, while I'm coming back from downstairs, I hear a door slam, heavy footsteps, and then Roger is standing at the top of the stairs. He told me there was a strange man outside and that he'd walk me to my car. I stopped, hesitated, then nodded. I trusted Roger. He was harmless... or so I thought. 

I sent a text to my boyfriend and told him I was on my way home. My phone (conveniently enough) died right after that text was sent. I gathered my things, but I couldn't find my wallet. I had left it on the front desk, but it wasn't there. I looked all around, retraced my steps, and spent an extra 30-45 minutes looking. Roger joined in to help. He pretended like it was a game and was laughing about it the entire time. I was growing uncomfortable - and agitated because I couldn't find my fucking wallet. 

As Roger bent down to look under a table, I saw the tip of my wallet poking out of the *back of his pants.* He had had my wallet the entire fucking time. But I felt uneasy about the whole thing. Why did he go along with this ""joke"" for so long? I called him out on it, beyond pissed off. I told him (rather abrasively) to give me my goddamned wallet back, and he held it out in front of me like I was a fucking dog. 

I thought to myself, ""You only have $5 and your student ID in there. You can get a new ID for about $10. Let the fucker have it."" So I turned around, grabbed my keys, and hauled ass out of the door. I turned around, and was instantly barreled over by Roger. I hit the pavement outside the dining hall hard enough to daze me. He was laughing, and my vision was spinning. 

I pulled myself up. Roger was pushing me around, almost taunting me. I started *wailing*. I mean, straight-up Jamie Lee Curtis *screaming*. Roger shoved me hard enough to cause me to fall again, and I just got up and ran across the parking lot. He was much larger than me and much faster. He ran along beside me and just laughed. The fucker laughed. I didn't even run to my car. I ran out into the middle of the highway and screamed for everything I was worth.

Roger was running up to me, just as campus security sped (and stopped) right beside him. They asked what was the problem, but I was hyperventilating and having a panic attack. Roger just swore up and down he was trying to give my wallet back to me, but I finally sobered up enough and just screamed: ""HE WAS CHASING ME AND HE TOOK MY WALLET AND HE WOULDN'T LEAVE ME ALONE!!!"" and blah blah blah, damsel in distress, tears, blah blah. All that mess.

They took Roger in, and my boyfriend came and saved the day for me. After they watched the security footage, Roger left campus after that. Never heard what happened, didn't care, and I vowed to never work another overnight job alone again. It was pretty fucking terrifying.

First off, to start on a light and happy note, we have hit 30,000 subscribers! Whoot! But with a larger reader base and more people recalling their encounters, there are old readers that are calling for action.

Many people are complaining about the heightened amounts of stories revolving around ""OMG HE LOOKED AT ME AND I THINK HE WANTED TO RAPE ME. OMGLULZSOSCARY."" Stories like that have to stop because this is /r/letsnotmeet NOT /r/myparanoiatookovermycapacitytothinkanditwasdarksoiautomaticallyassumehewantedtorapeme.

1331954472.0	r0dd8	Tips! Lets keep each other alive!	EtsuRah	389	49	171	"So I discovered this subreddit about a week ago and it has basically become my go to page when I get home from work.

My father was a paranoid ex-military. And my mother is an ex-Officer. I can honestly say I learned some trick of the trade in 'Don't Fuck With Me 101'

I have encountered PLENTY of weird situations and have came out unscathed in all of them.

Please add your tips as well! 

So the first layer of your personal bubble should be demeanor:

-----1.) HOODS! Hoods give off a creepy vibe, a hood makes you seem devious when properly worn. They are less likely to follow you if you look like you are also up to something, or going to cause them any trouble. They go for the easiest target. Hoods can also be seen as an obstruction of view, and should be decided upon the wearer. Whichever makes you feel unapproachable and safe. 

-----2.) Gaze. Look BEYOND where your headed. Seem as though you got somewhere to be and your fucking PISSED about it. 

-----3.) Look around a lot. Make it known that you are aware of your surroundings. But don't just merrily look around like ""OH! Such a beautiful night! Look at all the pretty trees and lights!"". Make it shady. Look over your shoulder with a furrowed brow and a slightly downward frown.

-----4.) Swagger. Walk with a steady foot. As if the front foot weighs a TON. Slam that foot down firm. Make it seem as though you are well rooted with your balance. Keep your back straight, neck straight and head UP. 

-----5.) Make sure they cannot see your hands. Put them in your pockets, readjust your belt line, stick your hand in your jacket like you have an inside pocket. Never let them thing you aren't armed. 

NO GODDAMN HEADPHONES!

All these may seem hard to do at once but you eventually just end up doing it by nature. Just like scaring off animals, make it seem like you are bigger than you actually are.

If they happen to penetrate your space then you take these steps.

-----1.) Act equally insane. My friends make fun of me for this but it saved me before. I was being held up and he had no weapon. He came up behind me and wrapped his arm around my neck. The only thing I could think to do was yell in the deepest voice I could muster. [Like this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRsjCWNXtRE). It does three things. It disorients the perp, it gets the adrenaline pumping, and if you yell long and hard it even tightens the chest muscles. I took a rooted stance and flipped him over my shoulder and yelled ""I wanna slit your throat and fuck the wound"". Needless to say he was gone, quick.

-----2.) Self defense. Many people don't have proper training so heres a quick thing to do that takes absolutely NO SKILL. Take your thumbs and press them as hard as you can in the space between the ribs. It hurts.... BAD. It is also a good way to easily break the cartilage, and the bone with very little pressure. It takes seconds to do. Make sure you get the side of the rib, not directly in front.

-----3.) Carry a weapon. Find your state laws on legality and get the most menacing knife you can get within limits. But only follow this step if you 100% completely intend to use it. It can easily be used against you if you hesitate. They are there to harm you, you should have no remorse for THEIR safety.

The best way to protect yourself is to avoid completely. Sometimes it is inevitable but a lot of the time people just can't see their surroundings because they lack the skills of perception. Trust me if someone approaches you and you seem surprised it's because you aren't paying attention. They have been casing you for a while. So if a man comes up to you on the street, you better believe he has been following you for the last couple blocks.

Ways to enhance perception. My dad taught me these.

- Sit with your back to a wall. Or anywhere that you can see the most people. 

-When you enter a room count Items on people like as soon as you walk in count how many people have hats or something, and keep tabs of who enters or exits so that your tally of people with hats gets lower or higher. It is very hard at first, but after a while you will be able to walk in a room take a half a second scan, and be able to instantly count the number of people, where they sit, what they wear. It becomes almost instinct.

-When around numbers of people look at ALL of their eyes, whether they are looking at you or not. Take note at who also looked back at you, then glance repeatedly at them. If they keep doing it then you can asses the situation before it escalates.

-LISTEN! We go by everyday just hearing the sounds of people talk, like a dull murmur. Single people out and listen as you walk by. Soon you will be able to fine tune your hearing. I personally talk about shit right in front of people fully knowing they are blissfully unaware. It's almost like the saying ""Hidden in plain sight"". 

- God this is going to sound stupid but it works. Blindness. Whenever your in a safe zone, lets say middle of the day, you're just hanging on your front porch. Close your eyes and just feel. Depending on our eyes stunts our hearing and sense of touch at times. My dad used to blindfold me and stomp around for hours. Soon you can feel vibrations. Nothing superhero like, so don't think you're gonna become spiderman or some shit. But I can FEEL cars pass on the road, people walk around, airplanes above(I live next to an airport so it's not hard to feel them anyway). There are time when this is useless. Not too often can you feel people on pavement, cars maybe, but people no. But indoors since floors vibrate easily, it works really well.

All these skills take time but eventually it's just like breathing, you just do it. It's hard but well worth it.

1346781274.0	zcgw3	Fake Policeman		411	73	41	"(Background info) I live in a middle class suburban town in an East coast state that is EXTREMELY anti-drug. The fleet of police, especially unmarked/""undercover"" cops (as we call them), is absolutely absurd for our relatively crime free town. (Except for pot smoking kids that is) There are unmarked police cars of every kind,  from brand new chevy sedans and hatchbacks, to brand new cadillac pickups and suvs, dodge chargers, gmc and ford suvs, classic ford grand victorias, jeep wranglers, fake taxicabs, and everything you could possibly think of. 

Because there are so many unmarked police cars in my area, they often get decommissioned, and are sold as used cars that still very much look like police cars. A friend of mine owns a decommissioned ford grand victoria.

Last week I was on my way home from a date in an area I was slightly unfamiliar with around midnight. I was driving along at the speed limit, and I see a blatant undercover police car tailgating me in the otherwise deserted road. He follows me for about five miles, before finally turning on his lights. I was nervous, I had never been pulled over, and I was driving past 11 (Not allowed for minors in my state) Not to mention I had a small amount of illegal herbs hidden under my spare tire in my trunk. So, knowing my towns extremely harsh police force, I was nervous. 

I pull off the road into an abandon out of business gas station, and I have my papers ready. The policeman approaches my window, he is wearing a police uniform, and I take notice that he's surprisingly good looking, in his early twenties, with longer-than-most-cops blond hair. He leans his head uncomfortably far into my small car, asks me where I'm headed, and if I know why I was pulled over. I answer, and I say ""No"" to the latter question. He smirks and says ""I do"", before returning to his car with my license, registration, and proof of insurance. The nearby streetlight illuminates his unmarked car, and I study it in my mirror.

He had a civilian license plate, no police badge on it. I also noticed as he walked away that his pants were much too short for him, the bell bottoms awkwardly exposed six inches of his ankles. I had a very bad feeling about the whole thing, but I remained in my car. He comes back to my car, and asks me to pull around behind the building of the closed gas station. I say ""Sure!""  and turn on my car, but inside alarm bells are ringing. There was no reason for me to go behind the building, other than to hide our cars from the road. I roll up my window and dial 911 as he walks back to his car. 

I tell the operator I was just pulled over by a suspicious police car, and I read her the license plate number. She tells me that it cannot possibly be a police car, and I should get out of there as soon as possible and drive to a public place. So I pull behind the building as he instructed, with him following, and I pull my car around the otherside of the building, and make a break for the road. He turns on his lights and follows. 

By this point I'm still on the line with 911, and my operater isn't giving me any helpful information. I'm trying to win a car chase in my 1994 0-60 in twenty minutes nissan, crying hysterically. I'm flying down a road I don't know at 75 miles an hour, faster than I'd ever driven before, and my car begins shaking violently and the timing belt starts clicking and whirling. But I'm still going. The policeman keeps a steady trail behind me, lights, but not sirens, on. My poor car screams and screeches through a red light, and after the turn I realize I'm on the road that runs through my town, I know exactly where I am. This road is much more populated, and I have my fingers on the horn (its a button) and I'm weaving through angry drivers at 60 on a 40 mph road.  My only hope is to attract the attention of a real police officer, because I know that they hide on this road to catch speeders. I finally approach an out of business diner that sits in front of my neighborhood, I whip into the parking lot, because I've never passed that diner without there being a hiding policecar. 

I stop my car and look around desperately. I don't see anyone. I've never felt such a feeling of hopelessness in my life. I thought I was going to die. When I drove into that parking lot I expected to run into the arms of my hero, but instead I was alone in an abandon parking lot. The only sounds were the violent protests coming from my engine, and I was sure it wouldn't start again if I tried. I froze. I'm not sure how long I sat there with white knuckles, strangling my steering wheel. I only turned around when I heard a car door slam, and I was sure this was the end. I look at the mirror, expected the horrible short pants wearing fake policeman, but instead I see three, marked, real policecars, with five or six real policemen exiting, hands on guns, looking concerned. 

They brought me to the station, took my statement, and calmed me down. Apparently the fake police car gave up chase when I turned into the parking lot, probably fearing there was a hiding policecar there. They praised me on my ""critical thinking"" and calling 911, and told me there had been a string of violent rapes, one ending in a girls death, in the neighboring state, all pulled over by a car matching my description. Far as a I know, they haven't caught him yet. 

**TL:DR
Pulled over by a fake policecar, car chase insues, park where I expect to find a real police officer, there is none, but serial rapist gave up pursuit on me. **"	t5_2t3t8	True
1373754256.0	1i8pb3	Fat dude with a sandwich saved my former barista roommate.	DracarysStormborn	397	57	43	"About four years ago my college roommate was working in a local cafe. She had been a barista for years and was working the closing shift at this point.
 It was around closing time, probably almost 7pm when a tall, harmless looking guy walks in and comes up to the counter while she's performing her closing duties. He starts talking to her but doesn't order anything, so she asks if he would like her to make him something, as she is closing the place down. He then begins to move around the counter to the opening of the counter to get closer to her. At this point she is completely freaked and running through her mind everything she could possibly use as a weapon. He's saying things like ""don't worry"" and ""I'm not gonna hurt you."" 
He then gets too close for comfort, pretty much backing her into a corner, so she flung open the mini fridge to get a barrier between them and hit him in the legs. He reached his hand out and said "" I just want to touch your hair."" She is in tears and asking him to back away and leave. He has a lock of her hair in his fingers when the cafe's door opens and a chubby man with a Subway sandwich in one hand and a newspaper in the other walks in and asks; ""are you open?"" Giving my friend a chance to escape the grabby hands of the creeper, who then booked it out of the cafe. The sandwich man was completely oblivious to the event he had just thwarted and why my friend was broken down in tears at his arrival. 
The next day the manager reviewed the camera footage and printed a photo of the creeper. She never closed alone again and her co-workers said that the guy had come by a few more times after that. He even asked after her once.
The worst part is, a few months prior to this, she was assaulted by a guy at a party who was never caught. Poor girl was a creeper magnet for a while there."	t5_2t3t8	True
1338742980.0	uirc6	I don't trust hotel staff anymore.	vietoushka	384	47	31	"When I was about 16, I went on a trip to Cabo san Lucas with my family and my best friend.  My friend and I had a hotel room to ourselves for the trip, something I was naturally excited about.

One afternoon, I was getting on the elevator and a security guard got on with me.  As the elevator rose, he looked at me, and said, ""Excuse me, were you wearing a green skirt on the beach the other day?""  

""Um, yes, why?"", I replied.  I was already reflexively creeped out at the mention of a miniskirt I had worn a few days prior.

""Oh nothing, I really liked it a lot.""

When I got out of the elevator, he got off on the same floor, and was walking past as I took out my keycard to unlock the door to my room.  

At 4am that morning, I woke up with a start, only to register that there was a man standing silently at the foot of my bed.  A man in a security guard uniform, the one from the elevator.  As he saw me wake up, he stammered something about my door not being locked properly and ran out of the room.  I was still groggy with sleep and didn't fully register what had just happened.  A moment after he ran out, I became aware I was lying on my back, with the covers around my ankles.  

I sleep nude, but never kick my covers off in my sleep as I'm always cold and the AC was on full blast as well.  I'm also a very deep sleeper, so someone standing at my bed alone would never stir me.  I'm pretty sure him pulling the covers back, causing me to get cold, is what woke me.  I am scared to think what could have happened had my friend not been fast asleep in the next bed.  

Unfortunately, as I was creeped out in the elevator and had avoided making eye contact or looking at his face, and as it was so dark I couldn't have identified him in the room, I never bothered to report it to the hotel.  I still regret that, years later."	t5_2t3t8	True
1352069003.0	12mu0y	The Killers Next Door	Augumenti	397	58	22	"I'm much older than most of you guys.  I grew up in the San Fernando Valley in the fifties and sixties.  In the late sixties, I was a hot young hippie chick with long straight hair and thought I was the shit.

The Valley was still pretty white bread then.  Guys with long hair and people who did drugs were rare enough to be unusual at that time - it all changed soon after, but this was still a relentlessly square place.  One of the first oddball groups that moved into my neighborhood was a collection of wild-eyed guys with greasy long hair and young hot hippie girls with rebellious attitudes, much like I was.  We all did the best we could to ignore them.  They kept to themselves, out and about mostly at night.

One day I was walking over to my boyfriends house, on a main street.   A guy from the group was walking toward me.  He had the craziest eyes I've ever seen, and I felt seriously threatened, even though it was the middle of the day and we were surrounded by people.  As he passed me, he smiled and said ""Beep, beep"" - while reaching out and grabbing one of my breasts, and twisting it hard.  He kept strolling nonchalantly on his way, kinda chuckling to himself.

I just stood there for a minute and watched him walk off, shaking hard.  I was usually pretty mouthy, but I didn't want any more of his attention so I just kept going on my way.

It wasn't until years later after I read Helter Skelter that I realized that creepy group was the Mansons, right before they moved to the Spahn movie ranch.  Apparently their favorite activity at that time was to do ""creepy crawlies"" - break into people's houses in the neighbor hood at night and watch them sleep, as practice for what was to come.  I lived about two blocks away from their house and was completely freaked out when I read it.  I've often wondered if our house was one that they practiced in.

Also, what people don't always realize was that Spahn's movie ranch was near to a whole horse riding community and lots of other small ranches and boarding stables.  It wasn't really that isolated.  My best friend kept her horse in one of the boarding stables near by.  She was friends with an old ranch hand named Shorty that worked on the Spahn ranch, until he disappeared..."	t5_2t3t8	True
1370368375.0	1fnxuj	[UPDATE] I don't think I'm alone in my house. I don't know for sure, but I'm scared to find out.	MadreDios	409	72	70	"Hello there, I'm the boyfriend of OP who made [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1fjiyt/i_dont_think_im_alone_in_my_house_i_dont_know_for/). I can be confirmed by [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1fjiyt/i_dont_think_im_alone_in_my_house_i_dont_know_for/cabj8q5?context=3). People have been asking for an update, so here it is.

Spend last night alone in the house basically shitting myself, had two friends over so I could sleep maybe a bit more soundly (I didn't).

I phoned the police offices today and they sent a couple of officers around to check the house, including the dreaded attic. Well, now for the boring conclusion: nothing is there. The house is empty, the attic is empty and sealed up, no way in or out. So that's it. 

They are concerned that someone has keys to our house, either picking up the pair I lost (such as a homeless guy coming in for cigs and warmth every so often - nothing has been stolen) or a previous tenant. They advised me to change the locks, so the landlord is coming over tomorrow to sort that out. 

The most likely conclusion is this: one of friends have been sneaking cigs, and are generally acting weird, they (whoever) has denied this and is so scared of us finding out (why??) that they let it get this far. I need to have a serious talk with my housemates now. As for the other unexplained shit, I don't know - maybe put it down to human anxiety? One thing gets creepy, the mind starts finding weird shit happening everywhere, and works itself up. I guess that the rather unsatisfying but better answer.

So that's it, the relatively boring update to a scary happening: stupid housemates, anxiety and some lock changing. I'd like to thank you all for your concern and comments, you truly scared the shit out of us.

Cheers guys!

EDIT: For all of you who are a wondering about all the unexplained shit, then I don't know what to tell you. Nothing in the attic, friends all deny it - that's it, what can we do? We're changing the locks - the chance it could be someone coming in at night and smoking our cigs is possible, and that's it. There's nothing more to do (and no, I'm not doing a seance or Ouija Board. Not a believer, but I will creep myself out further for no reason). Sorry it had such a disappointing, non-murdery ending.

1357078503.0	15sg9g	"""I just want to talk."""	RetJoSek	412	77	89	"Here is some context: I was 16 (Male) and living with just my mother and sister, making me ""the man of the house"". We live in an extremely rural area where it is about 40 houses in several miles, so 2 rows of houses surrounded by woods, fields and a large lake. And for the final context; my sister is a huge obnoxious bitch. (And no this isn't some childish sibling rivalry.)

So it was 3am, and of course being a 16 year old boy I was still awake; skyping with my girlfriend at the time. I wasn't paying any attention to my surroundings, until I heard my sister shouting. There was a large man whistling outside of my house and she was shouting obscenities at him to shut up. To me it seemed like the guy had just been walking by whistling until she shouted at him to shut up; during his attention towards us.

I ended my call and ran to her room and told her to shut up, but it was too late, the man outside came into our garden and just stared at the window with a grin; still whistling. We were understandably freaked out, and just tried to ignore him, this went on for about 20minutes. Him still stood there... Staring.. Still whistling... 

This went on until we heard a voice, he was shouting for us to let him in. I opened the window to threaten because.. Well I didn't know what to do. But the second I opened he said ""I just want to talk. I know Jessica is back there. Let me see her."" Of course we don't know anyone by that name, which I relayed to him. This went on for about 30 minutes, he started pounding on the door, attempting to break in. Being the stupid 16 year old I was I kept trying to go down there with my bat to defend my family. Luckily my sister stopped me.

Then suddenly it stopped, the banging, the shouting, everything. I peered out the window to see him picking up a brick. Safe to say I had never picked up the phone so fast. Before I could get through to the police though my sister shouted me, a group of people were walking by. This spooked the guy, seconds before using the brick for whatever he was going to do. Safe to say we didn't sleep easy for a good couple of days.

Unfortunately it doesn't end there... About 3 days later on my way home from school I had picked up a newspaper. This paper contained an article with a picture of the man from that night on it in. The title was ""Family brutally murdered and raped"". According to the article, the man from that night had tricked somebody into opening their door, then stabbed the woman, then raping her and her daughter. This happened the same night; just hours later.

Suffice to say, whistling frightens me to the core.

1346080552.0	ywn0s	My work shift this past Saturday.	McBurger	426	90	47	"Hello, this is my xpost from r/nosleep. A commenter there told me I should post the story here too, and I haven't heard of this subreddit before, but it seems appropriate.

____

Forgive me in advance, that this may not be nearly any sort of quality that you're used to. There's a lot of talent in this subreddit, great authors and imagery and suspenseful tales. I am not one of these talented persons, and I've never posted here before (not too much spooky has happened to me prior to this).

Also, I know ""everything we see here in nosleep is true"", but this is honestly a 100% true story. For that reason it may seem a little bit of a letdown that shit doesn't get crazy paranormal or anything, but I was panicked at the time.

I work part time for my university's IT department. I manage the public computer sites, fix machines when they're broken, handle scheduling of the other consultants, etc. I'm mostly on call all the time, and during a Summer weekend there is not much to do except get paid.

The campus library is across the hall from my office. Normally it is open, even on weekends, but it was closed for the intersession this weekend before the semester begins. Lights off, doors locked. There's no way to get in unless you have swipe card access, which I do. There are computers in there.

So I'm in my office passing time on the Internet, when I hear a bit of a racket. I peek out the door and there's this bigger man, probably about 40, tugging on the doors and trying to rip them open. He noticed me come out and asks (more like yells) to me: ""When does this place open?!""

I pointed to the hours sign and explained it would be open on Monday when classes begin. He walks away, and seems unsatisfied with that answer.

More time passes, and out of boredom, I decide I'm going to go check out the Library. I've only been in there once before while it was closed. I swipe my card and go in. It's really creepy in that place when it's closed. I wasn't supposed to be in there, if I got caught I'd probably be in a small amount of trouble since I really didn't have permission or a reason for being in another department's area during closed hours.

All the lights are off except, with the only light coming through the windows. The place is huge and you can hear ventilation fans clicking on and off. As I creep past the rows and aisles, the locked-door study cubicles creak and make noises occasionally as if someone were inside them. Which is often true; students are known to hide in there after library closing to study in a quiet setting, or to have sex in them (yeah, gross). But the library has been closed for almost 24 hours at this point, and no one likely camped out in here; it's just noises.

Still as I walk alone in this place, it feels like I'm not alone. I go to the lounge area and sit, but I feel uncomfortable with the dark silence and get up soon. So I walk to the bathroom, and as I walk in I notice there's someone in the stall.

All I can see is one foot at first glance from underneath the door. One naked foot, no shoes or socks, in a public restroom. One naked, *bloody* foot. There's a small pool of blood on the floor in the stall, and small trickles of blood on the foot.

I froze for a small moment and tightened up. I was startled first because I hadn't expected to find anyone else here. Second, a fucking bloody foot.

I didn't see any sort of socks or shoes around, no pants around ankles, nothing like that. I didn't even see a second foot. A pale, cold white foot. Large, too.

The stall door is partially open, but not enough that I could see inside from my angle.

I say with a shaken voice ""Hello?""

No response, nothing happens. I wonder if there's even a body attached to that foot. I wonder if there's a dead body inside. I wonder if some kid is killing himself here.

I ask ""What the fuck are you doing, man...?""

Then the toes slowly curl up, flex, then relax.

I promptly turned right out the door and walked out of the library quickly. Got back into my office as I tried to make sense of what I just saw. Should I call campus police? I really just didn't want to get involved with dealing with paperwork, questions with the police... I justified that I wasn't supposed to be over there anyway and would have to lie about some reason of why I was, and I called my friend Andy instead. I just wanted to talk to someone about what I had seen, I felt queasy.

Andy and I talk for a good 40 minutes, most of it just like ""Shit, dude, that's messed up"" and no startling discoveries. Heavily considered calling police but so much time had passed I assumed the person would be long gone. The bloody foot also certainly thought he was alone, so he would have been startled by my appearance too. 

I decide I'm going to go back, and stay on the phone with Andy. I knew how stupid this was; if someone is hurting themselves, they may not care to hurt me either. They're probably very unstable and they have some sort of knife or blade. I'm not in any mood to get in a knife fight here during my shift, but I want to go check the bathroom again.

As I walk through the library, it's worse this time. Because now I'm not alone, and there's someone else here possibly with a weapon. Still dead silent and dark.

I softly walk to the bathroom and listen outside the door for a moment. I don't hear any sound, but I get the chills. Andy is on speakerphone, but is staying silent.

I go inside; foot is still there. There's more blood than before. Still cold and pale looking. The door is now shut to the stall; the only other change in the last 40 minutes.

I was *really* hoping not to see anyone in here this time. I do not want to anger a possibly suicidal person. 

I ask ""...Are you alright?""

No response. No motion. Only blood. It makes me feel sick.

I repeat, ""Are you okay in there? Do you need me to call for help?""

Slowly, the foot turns and points toward me. A second foot steps down alongside it, also with blood smeared all over it. Whatever is inside the stall is now standing and facing directly at me, with the wall between us. I can't see the top of any head.

My heart starts racing. Finally, a deep voice responds ""I am fine.""

That was good enough an answer for me. I promptly turn and leave; this time I run.

I had told myself before going in that if he was still there, I'd definitely call police. I still didn't. He said he was fine. I wanted to put this out of my head and forget it.

The voice sounded like an older man, I'd guess 30-50. The size of the feet made him seem big, but not tall. It's hard to say.

I lock the door to my office and do nothing for the last 30 minutes or so of my shift. When I step out into the hallway, there are bloody footprints walking out of the library and over to my office door. Plenty of them outside my door; it was pacing and standing there for a while. Small drips of blood led away from my door and stopped after a small distance.

I was horrified. I hurried to my truck. I paused for a moment and realized with the amount of blood outside my office door and in that hallway, I can't just leave. I'll probably be asked about it anyway. I should call it in.

I head back up, all the footprints are mostly gone. All of the fucking bloody footprints and drops are wiped away. There are small smears here and there, it wasn't a perfect cleaning job. I was only gone at my truck for maybe 5-10 minutes.

Whatever it is, it's still here, hanging around. Watching me. Cleaning up after itself too. I am very frightened.

I go back to my truck. There are bloody towels in my door handle, on the ground, on the hood of my truck. This person is seriously fucking with me.

I hurry right over to the campus police. I'm just gonna tell them the whole story. Even the fact that I was also trespassing, and that I went back for a second visit instead of calling police first. And I did. I told all. They took pics of my car, and told me they'd look into it. They returned to the library but requested that I do not accompany them back inside.

I went home. This was two days ago and I have not heard anything since. I work again tonight, another closing shift."	t5_2t3t8	True
1329935275.0	q17ua	[My] Very creepy neighbour	Chittensmop	369	42	32	"When I was 12, my family moved from a farm just outside town into a really nice house close to the centre of a small town. I hadn't ever lived in town before, and I was happy just to have neighbours for the first time in ages. It had been about 5 or 6 years, not since we had lived in the city, which wasn't terribly 'neighbourly' either.


We were second off the corner, and around the corner was a motorcycle shop with its back facing the side of our property, so we only really had one direct neighbour, and they had a couple of little girls, maybe 5 and 6. They were nice, but I was 12, so I was almost a woman, don't you know. Too sophisticated for children. Next house down from that was a group of four flats, with a bunch of guys in their early 20s living in them. All the fences were waist height, and our yards weren't very wide, so you could talk from fence to fence, even with the yard in between.

I liked that, and I would go out and talk to some of the guys, flirt a bit, in the way only 12 year olds can - where the other person probably isn't even aware you're flirting but only because you're so damn young. The guys liked me, kind of like a kid sister. They were always outside during the summer, and we got really close. One of the guys got married, moved out. The flat was empty for maybe 3 weeks before someone moved in, and I was keen to meet the new neighbours.

Turned out three guys had moved in, Shane and 2 guys I never knew the names of. One of the men was profoundly retarded, Shane had mental problems and learning difficulties, and he really gave me the skeevies, and the other guy... he was something else. He was in some sort of assisted living program, he had a 'helper' who he treated like a mother, he worked part time at a local appliance retailer, and he always had this dirty hat with an upturned brim on, even at night. 

One day while I was hanging the washing, I felt like I was being watched. I turn around, and this other guy, ""Warren"", was staring at me. He climbs over the fence into next doors yard, crosses the yard up to my fence, goes to climb over it but I was backing away, and he stopped with his hands in the air, like a surrendering backing off gesture, and he said ""it's ok, I just want to talk"". 

I had backed up against the edge of our garage so I just stood there, and he told me his name was Warren and asked me mine. I told him my name was Emma. 

""How old are you Emma? I'm 25.""

""I'm 12.""

""How old is your sister? she's pretty like you.""

""She's 13.""

""I bet she's not a virgin, she doesn't look like a virgin."" 

At this point I'm feeling my way back across the edge of the garage so I can run into the house.

""Does she have a boyfriend? I'd like to be her boyfriend.""

He doesn't seem to realise I'm not responding, or that I'm now struggling to breathe. I have severe anxiety and have always been prone to panic attacks, which is a terribly inconvenient way to handle situations like this.

""She seems like someone who would let me be her boyfriend. I know you'd never let me be your boyfriend, you're pretty like a picture from a magazine.""

I remember this word for word. I can hear his voice as I type it.

He stepped over the fence at this point, and when I went to dart left he darted with me. 
He stepped a little closer to me with every word, very carefully and slowly, circling around so I was trapped between the garage and the clothesline. 

""You'd never let me be with you, but that doesn't mean I couldn't have you.""

He grabbed my arm at that point, and knelt down on the ground so our faces were level, and I could feel his breath on my face. 

James, one of the guys from the flats, went outside at that point, and saw me standing petrified with this guy clutching me and everything, and came running over, leaping over the fences like they were hurdles. I literally passed out at that point, and woke up with my dad calling my name. 

James had apparently beaten the guy up pretty good, but he'd managed to run away. He had called my dad, and waited with me until he got home, not sure if he should try to wake me up or not. 

My dad was freaked out and wanted to kill the guy, called the cops and everything, but the guy had split. He left his stuff behind (which wasn't much, by any account) never picked up his last paycheck, and turned out to be using a fake name.  The name he was using was Frank but he had told me his name was Warren, and apparently Frank didn't exist. It was all very confusing and in the end nothing came of it.

I don't go in for the whole neighbourly thing any more, but I would hate to think how it would have ended if it weren't for James. I had lucid nightmares about Warren for years, most of which ended in my death in his bathroom. I don't know why his bathroom, but it was almost always the bathroom. I actually went inside the flat he'd been in, years later, and I was surprised at how accurately I had pictured it,  but relieved that the bathroom had such a different layout. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1328415633.0	pbh5v	[My] Grandfather is a lucky man.	Torrenthurder	376	43	39	"My Grandfather is not a nice person.  Almost everyone in the family has cut ties with him.  In short he steals, you can't trust him around young children, and he is a convicted murderer.  But he is not as bad as his father.

My Great Grandfather was a rich man from a well off family.  All I know is that they had a lot of money and were weird.  By weird I mean they married prostitutes and paid people to have sex with animals and participated in those acts as well.  There are other stories, but I am just catching you up.  

My Grandfather was adopted.  It was originally thought that my Great Grandma could not have children because she had been a prostitute for so long.  But that turned out not to be entirely true. Soon after my Grandpas adoption, children started to be born.  

My Great Grandfather found out he had syphilis years later.  The doctor told him he had gotten it before his marriage because his condition was so bad and that he had been sterile for years. 

One day my grandpa was sent to school by himself.  When he came home he saw his father standing in front of their house smoking.  My Grandpa asked where everyone one was and he pointed toward the house.  My grandfather saw the house was starting to catch on fire so he ran toward the house and tried to open the door but the doors were locked.  He looked inside and saw my Great Grandma tied up with all the children.  They were screaming and crying.  He tried to break the window but was grabbed and held from doing so by his father.  He kept saying ""She is still a whore,"" over and over again. 

After that my grandpa was sent to live with other family members.  Great Grandpa was never arrested or convicted.  Different times.

I've been wanting to tell this story on reddit for a while.  Yeah I never met my Great Grandpa, but I wouldn't want to either.

1376612072.0	1kgejg	Roommate Wanted: Female Only	ScarsAndStripes	371	43	65	"This is a popular story with my family and most of my friends.

Amanda is my brother's girlfriend. At the time of this story, she was looking for her first apartment and moving out from her parents' house. Her and my brother didn't want to move in together since they had only dated for a few months. She opted instead to search for a roommate online. Browsing Craigslist, she found an ad titled something like ""Roommate Wanted: Females Only."" This sort of thing was common since the area she was looking in was mostly young professionals.

The listing was for a room in a house for about $225 a month, which was quite cheap compared to the most places listed. The occupant listed herself as a 23 year old college student that wasn't comfortable with living with any males. The other roommate would have their own room and attached bathroom. So far, Amanda was into this place. However, the listing only had a single photo from outside the property. Amanda sent an email wanting to meet the occupant and tour the house. Within 30 minutes, she receives an email back with all the details and time to stop by. The girl worked late hours and wanted Amanda to stop by at 8pm.

When Amanda arrives, there is a handwritten note on the front door saying ""Door broken, use back door."" Walking around the house, it looks nice but slightly unkempt: tall grass, weeds, dusty windows, etc. Still no alarms for Amanda though. When she knocks on the backdoor and an older man opens the door. At first Amanda thinks she has the wrong house but the man reassures her and says that the occupant (I forget the name) was out and he was the landlord. The occupant asked him to meet Amanda since she was working late. He seemed pleasant and offered to show her around. 

Alarms start going off but aren't at red alert yet. First, the guy was clearly in his 40's, unshaven, and looked like he lived in his car. Also, only the kitchen light was on. As they walked around the house, Amanda noticed one huge red flag: No furniture. Nothing. The landlord was polite about answering questions but seemed irritable to keeping lights on for too long, rushing her around and only letting her look at rooms for a few moments. There was a single room that the landlord wouldn't open, telling her that it was the occupant's room and he didn't want to invade her privacy. As they walk down the hallway into the living room, she notices the front door has a plank nailed across it. ""Broken"" for sure.

Amanda's creep-o-meter is started to ding so she decides to wrap up the walk-through and leave but trying to polite. As she's giving the guy her ""thanks for the showing"" bit, he perks up and states that he forgot to show her the basement. It's recently furnished and would be a great rec room...and she should take a look down there. At the time, Amanda and the landlord are standing in the small hallway between the front living room and the back kitchen. In this little hallway was the basement door. When he opens the door, it opens outward to create something of a barrier between Amanda and the backdoor. The basement is pitch black. He smiles, motions down the stairs, and says ""Ladies first.""

What happens next is nothing more than a stroke of luck. Amanda get a text just as some random person parks in front of the house. Thinking on her feet, she pretends it's a phone call and answers her phone. ""Hey! Yeah, are you here? I'll come out from around back and let you in. It's great, you have to see it."" With a motion of confidence, she excuses herself around the landlord and walks out of the back door. She says the guy just looked at her like he was confused. Once outside, she sprinted to her car and sped like hell out of there. 

When Amanda got home, she told her mother and my brother everything. Cops were called, they took her statement, and went to investigate. The Craigslist post had been removed.

EPILOGUE 

The house had been foreclosed over six months earlier and the property had been abandoned. When the police investigated, they found that the closed room the ""landlord"" didn't want her to look in was where the man had been staying. There was a pile of old dirty blankets, rotten food, and empty gallon jugs everywhere. More creepy was he had plastered ripped up pages from porno mags on ALL the walls in the room (where do they even find porno mags!?).

The really scary part of this was the basement. The man had tied a thin piece of fishing twine at about shin level across the stairs about halfway down. The basement was empty except another pile of old blankets, a broom handle wrapped in leather belts, and a small box with a few rolls of assorted tape (duct, electric, etc). 

Amanda ended up not moving in.

1372638121.0	1he829	Anonymous Tip Line Not So Anonymous	TrebleTreble	385	60	24	"A few summers ago I was working as a front desk receptionist at a popular downtown salon. On slower evenings, after the stylists finished their appointment schedule, I was occasionally left alone to book treatments and sell product until the salon closed. At this point you're likely thinking that some creep came in one evening when I was alone to do what creeps do, but I'm not the victim in this story. With that being said, one evening, when I was alone, a young man came in to schedule an appointment for his ""girl.""  He told me that he wanted her hair colored ""every shade of red you got."" I asked him what level of stylist he wanted (i.e. how much money did he want to spend) and he said it didn't matter, he just wanted the next available appointment, which was several days later and on my day off. He scheduled the appointment under her name, which I won't use, but know it was a very generic-sounding name.

When I returned to work I was playing around on the computer used for appointments and I suddenly remembered the appointment I had made for that man's ""girl."" I wondered if they had kept it. They had not, the appointment was marked as a no-show. I checked not because I had felt this man was creepy, but because I was being a judgmental ass. This young man appeared to not have a lot of money and that color appointment would have been expensive. Judgment confirmed and I didn't think about it again.

About three weeks later I am standing at the front desk and this same man walks in with a very young girl. At the time I guessed that she was about 15 and he was in his late 20s. I glanced down at name on the next appointment and it was not the same name the man had previously given me, but it was an equally forgettable name. They approached me and, sure enough, he was checking her in for a color appointment. I suddenly went from judgment to full on suspicion, but this girl did not seem scared or uncomfortable at all. In fact, she seemed very sweet and a bit dreamy (think Luna Lovegood in the Harry Potter series). And he was perfectly pleasant just as he'd been before. I checked the young girl in and alerted the stylist that her appointment had arrived. 

I knew the color was going to take a good 2.5 hours, but the man stayed the entire time. Most of the time he just messed with his phone and ignored everything and everyone around him. At some point our youngest receptionist (16) came on for her shift. I don't remember noting if the man noticed her, it just seems like suddenly he was at the other end of the counter talking to her. I couldn't hear what was said, but the body language and facial expressions indicated a confident man flirting with a young girl who was shy, but pleased with the attention she was receiving. Having once been a shy 16-year-old girl myself (I was 23 then) my red flags and alarm bells were marching in a parade all around me. When the stylist who was coloring the young girl's hair went to the back office, I followed.

""So, what kind of color are you doing?""
The stylist rolled her eyes and said, ""I'm coloring that girl's hair about a million shades of red. Soooo tacky!""
(Cue the the master of ceremonies because this parade of red flags just reached the zenith.)
""Yeah, she'll regret that, but she seems like a nice kid.""
The stylist shrugged and said, ""She's kinda weird. Can hardly answer a simple question.""
""What do you mean?""
""I don't know, she's just really 
air-headed, like she doesn't even realize what's going on.""

Okay, I am very uncomfortable with all of this, but what the hell do I do? Call the police? And say what? So I did the god damn wrong thing: I watched them leave without saying a word. Her color cost $300 and he paid for it by taking out a huge cash roll and handing me twenties.
""Thank you, enjoy the rest of your 
day.""
""Yeah, you too.""

During this time I was working at the salon and at a restaurant in a city that was a 50 minute drive from my apartment. The drive was all freeway and I knew it well. The landscapes, gas stations, and mile marker signs tended to blend so when I passed a billboard that I had passed so many times before, it shocked me when I actually processed what it said: Report Human Trafficking.

And I knew that's exactly what that slimy motherfucker was doing with these young girls. I called the number and told my story. I expected bored derision from the woman at the other end. I was going on a gut feeling, afterall. Nope, the woman was friendly and professional and assured me it would be looked into. 

(Alright, Treble, you were a complacent chicken shit the first time, but you did the right thing today. Let's hope someone helps that poor girl. Oh, and don't forget to speak with your young, naive co-worker about that man.)

Two days later I'm back at the salon when three big men walk in. Alarm #1: their clothing was baggy and dirty, they looked rough. Alarm #2: two remained by the front door, attempting--and failing--to be aloof, while the biggest one walks straight toward me. 

""Is Treble here today?""
""Why?""
""I need to speak with her.""
""She can't have visitors at work and I'm not able to give out her schedule.""
Deep sigh and then a badge hanging from a chain on his neck slips out from under his t-shirt, ""I'm Officer 
So-and-So with the Anytown Police Department and I need to speak with her now."" 
""I'm her, let's go to the office.""

I proceed to tell and re-tell my story and answer a ton of questions. The officer also speaks with the stylist and my young co-worker. I gave him the phone numbers that the man left for each appointment he made (they were different) and then the three undercover officers left. It's over, they took me seriously, and they'll catch that piece of shit.

But they're back the next day, along with a man who's in plain clothes but openly wearing his badge. The same officer walks up to the counter and shows me a piece of paper. ""Is this her?"" he asks.
I don't really know what I'm looking at except to say that it's an advertisement of some sort. It's two black and white pictures of a young girl in nothing but a thong and text that is covered by the officer's hand. Also, I'm not sure if it's her. The girl in this picture looks very similar, but a lot heavier. I tell the officer this and he says impatiently, ""Well, what if she lost weight?""
""Yeah, I guess it could be her."" 
Then Officer So-and-So and this new guy follow me back to the office and ask me a few more questions. I am able to ask the officer if they've located her and he tells me that they have. He goes so far as to tell me that other undercover officers are headed to a hotel sting at that very moment.  I said, ""That's great!"" (Or something like that.)
The officer then asks me why I decided to call the tipline and I told him that the whole thing just didn't seem right. He made some joke about offering me a job because they needed more people who acted on instinct. So movie-like, right?
He then said that as soon as the sting was over he was going to make sure I was given proper recognition. Joy turned to fear and I was suddenly deep into my first realization that some cops are idiots who can't be trusted and that I too am an idiot.
""What?! No, no, no I don't want recognition! I want to stay 
anonymous!"" 
""That's too bad because you deserve to be rewarded.""
""No, no, no,"" and another realization that this officer has my full name, phone number, and place of employment written down in his stupid little notebook.
""What happens to your notes?"" I asked him.
Officer Fuckface responds like this: ""Don't worry, I've been doing this a long time and I've never lost an informant.""
What the fuck does that even mean?! This is not an episode of the god damn Sopranos (rip, Mr. Gandolfini)! I'm not an informant! I'm some dumbass who called an anonymous tipline.
Officer Jackass has to leave but Badge Man stays. Oh, I didn't mention who he was? Special Agent Gofuckyourself with the Attorney General's Office. And guess what? He's proud of me. He wishes more people cared like I do. He also has my phone number.

What happens next is obvious. I get mono and I'm begging the gods above to let me die in my intermittent sleep. And then I get a phone call from the salon manager, ""Uh, Treble, there's two TV news crews here...and some newspaper reporters too. We're playing dumb, but maybe it's a good thing you got sick.""
""Do they know my name?"" I ask.
""No.""
I put in numerous calls to the officer and special agent and received no response. But I thought they were proud of me...? 
The officer had given me two numbers, one to an office and one to a cell phone. After two days the cell number no longer worked (it had been answered once by a woman who promptly hung up on me) and the officer was never available when I called.
The special agent returned my call some days later. Finally! He wanted a written statement.  
Go fuck yourself.
He couldn't understand why I was being so uncooperative. 
Go. Fuck. Yourself.
Finally he threatened me with a subpoena. 
You want to subpoena someone who called an anonymous tipline? Go fuck yourself. 
He called me a few more times but I didn't answer. Ultimately I had to drag my sick ass to my favorite professor's office because he also happened to be a badass attorney. I felt incredibly uncomfortable asking for his advice, I felt I was definitely crossing a line. But I was desperate and very, very scared. I had now seen this story all over the news along with the words, ""An employee at a local business..."" 
Long story short, Professor Awesome helped me, Special Agent Gofuckyourself stopped calling, the man was arrested and charged with a number of things (including human trafficking), but he was released and I don't know what happened after that. I'm not scared anymore but I was looking over my shoulder that entire summer.

1370178022.0	1fim6l	Violin Hill	Nervacore	373	46	75	"*This is a cross post from /r/nosleep, you can find the original submission [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fi0e5/violin_hill/)*

So I'm new to Reddit and just discovered this sub, which is great because it means i can finally share this story. I know its probably said a lot and as always theres really no way to verify it, but what I'm about to tell you is 100% true. I'm not talented enough to make this up.


Around two years ago, I finally moved into a brand new house in a brand new building estate in Australia. I was one of the first to have a finished build in the area and was elated to finally gain independence. The first few weeks went by as normal and during that time, I'd often take walks alone with the dog in the afternoons and roam the surrounding estate area. 

All the roads around us had been partially completed and all the other properties were marked out, but no other houses were built excluding one that was directly opposite mine. The house looked finished, but there was no driveway laid yet and from what I could gather, noone lived there.


To the left of my house roughly a few hundred meters away was a field with a huge hill in it. I later found out that the whole area was council property, not only was noone allowed to build up there but the whole hill was basically a no go zone. For whatever reason, the council just didn't want people on it so the whole area was surrounded by a huge chain link fence. 

The only other noticeable feature in the area was a small abandoned farm house with a shed a few kilometres down the road. I knew nothing about it and often went walking there with the dog as it gave me something mild to explore amongst the vast nothingness I was living around. The entire place was dilapidated and completely inhabitable, but it was still interesting none the less.


About a month or two after moving in, I awoke one morning to the sound of a violin. It sounded extremely distant and quite haunting, I actually enjoyed it and assumed that the neighbours opposite me has finally moved in. Excited that I finally had some people to talk to, I peeked out the curtain and saw the house opposite mine was still as vacant as it ever was. I got dressed but by the time I managed to look outside, the violin has stopped. 

This happened roughly every second day for the next week, the violin would wake me up and then just disappear after about 45 seconds. I'd ignored it to the point where my curiosity simply got the better of me and the next morning when I heard the violin playing again I immediately jumped out of bed, threw on my dressing gown and shot out the front door. I scoured the early morning surrounding and there, up on the hill, was a figure playing a violin. 

It was barely light, but the person looked very tall from the distance I was at and as they were playing, was doing what could only be described as a waltz-type walk, spinning slowly around in a circle as they played. I took my eyes off the person and walked over to pick up the morning paper and in the 10 seconds that took me, I heard the violin stop. 

When I looked up, I noticed the figure was no longer playing or dancing, but was now standing still and most likely looking in my direction. It was so dark i couldn't make out and more and we both just stood there for half a minute not moving before the creeps got the better of me and I went back inside.


After that morning, things started happening. On my walks I began to notice footprints on the surrounding properties that weren't made by me and that I'd never seen before, which I just assumed were from people walking up from the other housing areas down the road. I never awoke to the violin, but I swore I could hear someone walking on the street next to my bedroom window in the early mornings, however I never saw anything. 

Other really general things as well, like random tools such as spades and rakes laying around the area which I guessed were left there by construction crews, none of which I ever saw. I'd started getting calls at work that would immediately hang up on me and I also stopped walking up to the abandon farm house, as the experience with the violin player had me a little shaken. 

One night as I was heading to bed, I turned off the television in the living room and again, could hear the faint sound of a violin playing, however it sounded more muffled and rehearsed. 

I froze and a cold chill flowed through me instantaneously. Considering that it was about midnight and not the usual time I'd hear it playing, I went to the front window and peeked out to see that there was a light in the house opposite mine. It was clearly a candle as I could see the dim light flicker in the empty window and the music sounded like it was coming from an old record player, but in the ten minutes I watched, I never saw any movement inside the house. 

I moved away from the window sufficiently freaked out and after another five minutes, I heard the music abruptly stop. I peeked out again to notice the light was now out. I never saw anyone. I began to become unsettled in the house and would often invite friends over to hang out until late, but of course nothing would ever happen when someone else was with me. I never bothered to tell any of my friends as without evidence, I figured they'd just give me shit about it and I'd just become more agitated.


But nothing compared to what happened next. In my living area, the desk sits right next to a small window which looks out to the fence surrounding my property. The steel fence is literally an arms length from the house and about six feet tall so I always figured that, unlike most of the other windows, I'd never need to cover this one with a sheet or blanket because noone could ever see in. I usually had headphones on when I played and I always had the lights off, for no other reason than I preferred to play games in the dark. 

One night when I was gaming, I got up and walked into the dark kitchen and got a beer out of the fridge. It was dead silent excluding the faint sound coming out of my headphones. As I closed the fridge and turned around to face the desk, I saw directly out the window two very, very faint lights. 

I didn't even catch on and immediately started walking back to the desk fixated on the small glowing balls and it wasn't until I had my nose almost pressed against the glass that I realised the two lights weren't lights at all. 

They were eyes. 

A set of eyes, sitting just above the fence line staring wide open at me. They didn't blink. They didn't move. My entire body locked up, all I could do was simply stare back as my brain was still comprehending that there was an actual person looking at me in the scariest way I could possibly ever imagine. I don't know what happened, either my head kicked into gear or my muscles loosened but my body automatically collapsed and I fell to the floor, scurrying to hide against the wall away from the window. 

I could hear my heart beating through the carpet like a drum as I tried to lay as flat as possible and as my mind was still processing the sheer severity of the situation, a violin started playing. That fucking violin and the haunting tune it always emitted started up, except this time it was directly outside my window and much louder than I'd ever heard it before. 

The lights were still off and I wanted to get up to turn off the PC screen so I couldn't be seen, but my whole body just wasn't ready to cooperate. Not only was the sound of the instrument extraordinarily loud, but it sounded like it was been played with frustration, notes been missed frequently and the strings screeching. The pace of it was getting faster and faster and by this time, my dog Jeb out in the backyard had picked up on the situation and registering an unfamiliar sound, gave one solitary, deep bark. 

The violin instantly stopped and the house was finally dead silent excluding my headphones which I could hear quietly working away. I was still frozen to the carpet and it wasn't until Jeb gave a second menacing bark that I heard the figure outside the window start to walk away in the direction of my yard. 


Once that first footstep hit the ground, I instantly thought of the welfare of my best mate and finally, my head connected with my extremities and my entire body kicked into overdrive. I left from the ground and slid across the laminated floor to the backdoor where Jeb was standing, staring into the backyard. I ducked to keep low and quietly unlocked and slid open the door. 

Usually doing so would notify Jeb that he was allowed inside but when the door opened up, he didn't move an inch and was completely fixated on the pitch black backyard. Everything told me not to go outside but there was no chance I was letting anything happen to my dog and I moved out onto the alfresco, moved behind Jeb, put my hand under his collar and attempted to back him toward the house. Jeb is a pure labrador and weighs like a sack of sand so when he doesn't want to move, it takes a sheer force to pull him in the direction you want him to go and right now, Jeb wasn't going anywhere. 

I yanked at his scruff and as I did, he emitted a bark like I'd never heard before, a deep, bellowing ""fuck you right off"" sound that elevated my nerves to an all time high. We both just stood there, waiting for some form of reply and I couldn't remember how long we both just froze there, but eventually i heard footsteps from around the side of the house begin to walk away. But not a simple walk, almost like whoever was doing it was slowly dancing in a circle, the footsteps keeping to a beat as they drifted away from the house into the distance. 

Once I couldn't hear anything, Jeb licked his lips, gave me a look and wandered back inside. I followed, locked the door behind me and spent the night reverting to my child-like self; hiding under my bed covers with my dog. I didn't sleep a wink.


That was the last time I ever saw or heard the violin player. The following morning when the sun finally came up, I called into work sick and called the police. They scoured the lot next to mine and found footprints in the dirt, however there were so many there that it was impossible to tell who's were who's. The only description I could give to the officer was his height, he would have had to be over 6ft to stare over that fence at me but they explained that he could have been standing on something, or on his toes. 

They also told me that they've never received a report of anyone playing a violin in the area or anyone been in the fenced off hill either. I essentially looked like an insane person, but the officers were very nice about the whole thing and offered to patrol the area for the next few nights which helped put my mind at ease. Nothing else has happened since then.


Over the next year or two, people finally started moving in and I tell them all the story about the figure I saw, some of which still use to keep their children in line which I found funny. One guy nicknamed the council lot 'Violin Hill' and the name has stuck around our street since then. I even spent a period of time scoring the depths of the Internet for that violin tune I kept hearing, but could never find it. There were a few classical pieces that seemed reminiscent, but I've since thought that whatever tune was played must have been self composed, which creeps me out even more.


I'm still in the house, I still tell people the story and I haven't changed my routine one bit which has really helped me to block out the fear of the experience.


I game with the blinds closed now.


&gt;**EDIT:** I've been thinking more and more about the whole ordeal lately after writing this story and decided to go charge up my old phone that was in the bottom of a box in my backroom to see if there were any pictures from the past that I'd taken. Sure enough, I [found this](http://i.imgur.com/Sqhk3Ml.jpg), a picture of Violin Hill from when I first moved in. This was even before the rest of the connecting roads existed and there was just country surrounding me (and apparently broken toilets, people used to dump shit up in this area because it was just so empty). From my very vague memory, the figure I saw was standing almost above that red and white post in between the trees on top of the hill. Like I said, they were very far away and the sun was only just coming up. 

&gt;The fence was also quite dilapidated and temporary when I moved in but as more people started to arrive and the roads were laid down, the council put up a proper perimeter to block off the hill. Is it to protect the land they own, or something more...? Hope this gave you guys a clearer image in your head!"	t5_2t3t8	True

I was sitting in my kitchen reading this subreddit (my favourite, but I digress) when my dog barked. This was slightly odd as she had been fast asleep so I decided to check it out. It's worth mentioning that I had none of the curtains drawn and all of the lights were on, so anyone about could see directly into my house. However, the doors and windows were locked and my kitchen overlooks the backyard, so I wasn't too worried.

I had barely gotten up out of my seat and turned around when I noticed a face pressed against the patio doors that open onto the deck, not 5 feet from where I was sitting. My immediate reaction, which surprised even myself, was to scream bloody fucking murder and fly straight at the door. The shadowy figure took off but he set off the floodlight on the corner of my house, which revealed him to be a thin, shirtless (very fucking weird) man. I couldn't distinguish much else, sadly.

I called the cops and they're on their way, but they won't be able to do much now as the fucker's probably long gone. The sketchiest part is I have no clue how long he was at the door or what he did to wake my dog up, since she was startled awake by some noise I somehow missed.

I'll be sure to update you all if the police turn up anything, I'm still kinda rattled!


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


EDIT: Alright folks, I'm back, sorry for the delay!

The cops showed up shortly after I posted last night. They snooped about but couldn't find any sign of the bastard. I had a chance to look around outside today to see if he left any traces but there was nothing. No footprints, no scratch marks, no fingerprints. My dog, however, sniffed about intently around the door for a few minutes...slightly worrying.

The police did mention there was a party a few blocks over that they had received a couple of complaints about, so it could have just been a disoriented drunk guy trying to make his way home. I don't really go for that though...I've walked home drunk many a time and never once have I decided to go into someone's backyard and peer in their windows. That's generally something left for people who are up to no good.

I saw a lot of comments regarding me having the curtains open, so I figured I'd address them. I'm from a fairly small town and I know all my neighbours. I'm usually not to worried about people being around at night, and if they are, I almost certainly know them. Also, my kitchen faces onto the backyard, so if there was someone out there, I'd rather know than be blissfully ignorant behind my closed curtains!

Anyway, sorry for the wait once again, and I'll update if anything else occurs.. My parents and sister are back home tonight and I told them about what happened, so we'll see if this incident was a one-off or if he'll be making a return.

1368820275.0	1ejc4j	Always look in your rearview mirror...	tkmac69	392	63	36	"Let me begin by stating that this story didn't happen to me, but a family friend. She is a couple years older than me, a beautiful twentysomething who works as a bartender/waitress at a local Western-themed dance club in the Chicago suburbs. Her name is Emily.

One day, she was at the end of her shift and grabbed some pizza at the Italian restaurant attached to the club. Unbeknownst to her, she was being watched the entire time. 

After leaving, the man followed her again in his car for several miles, of which she was totally unaware as she had not once looked in her rearview mirror; so it took her totally by surprise when another car rammed into hers, knocking them both off the road.

She was pissed off and exited her vehicle. The person who exited the other car was the man who had been following her. He approached her, saying, ""Sorry ma'am, I don't got insurance,"" before swinging a left hook at full strength, hitting her in the face with so much force that she immediately passed out. 

When Emily came to, she was in his car getting sexually assaulted, still at the location of the crash. She started screaming for help, but it was almost 5 in the morning and few people were about. This was occurring in front of houses, however, and someone did look out their window to see it occurring. They called the police.

By the time the police got to the scene, there was only Emily's dented car, still running, with the door open and pizza on the seat. The man, with Emily, was nowhere to be found. 

As it turns out, he had stopped assaulting her and asked if she wanted to go home. Of course, she said yes. They drove together through the town, Emily petrified with horror and dreading what she was almost certain would be her imminent death. 

Once they got to Emily's house, the car stopped in the street. The man looked at her and laughed an evil laugh. He shouted in a wicked voice, ""Now I know where you live!"" before speeding away. The police had barricaded every major road in the village, but by this point they were heading to the kidnapper's home in another town.

It was at this point that Emily remembered something that her mother told her: in the case of a kidnapping, rape, or sexual assault, force yourself to vomit. The attacker will most likely stop what he or she is doing to avoid it, and give you a chance to escape.

Emily started trying to vomit, which wasn't difficult given the circumstances. As she was gagging, her kidnapper said, ""If you puke in this car I'm going to kill you. Do it out the window."" 

She leaned out of the open window to puke, when she grabbed the outside door handle, opening it and thrusting herself out of the car and into the road. Emily ran from house to house, banging doors and screaming for help. There were no answers. Eventually, as she was being chased by the attacker, she came to an undercover FBI agent's home. His wife answered the door and immediately grabbed Emily by her pant-waist and threw into the house. The agent ran out of the house with his gun, where he met the attacker and arrested him. 

Emily ended up okay, although scarred from the attack. Here is the newstory about the ordeal: http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20121001/news/710019686/

A couple weeks later, on a related note, a woman came to Emily's house and knocked on the door. Emily's mother answered and the woman said, ""I'm an FBI agent. I'd like to ask you a few questions about the incident with your daughter."" Emily's mother asked for her badge, upon which the woman got a look like a deer in the headlights and sprinted away from the house.

1347905327.0	1017id	My Art teacher fell in love with my dad.	KhemikalReaction	388	69	40	"When I was about 10 years old I took private art lessons.  I was really into drawing at the time and my parents were always pretty good about letting me explore my talents and interests as long as I gave a good try and didn't just get bored after a couple of times.  

So I started taking lessons with this woman that was a friend of a family friend.  The actual lessons weren't that weird and I didn't get much of a creepy vibe from her myself.  I thought it was weird that her name was the same as my mother's but spelled differently but that wasn't really something that she had control over.  For several months I went to her house and had my lessons or worked on a painting.  If I had an assignment for art class we would work on that.  

One day I was picked up from school by my mother instead of riding the bus to daycare.  At the time, my mother worked so I was very confused by her being at the office to pick me up.  The car ride home was mostly silent and I started to get suspicious.  I asked it everything was ok, I assumed that one of my pets had died.  She told me everything was ok but my father was going to talk to me about it when he got home.  

For a couple of hours after I got home I just sat and waited on my dad.  I had the very real fear that I was in trouble.  My mother usually disciplined me but if I did something REALLY bad it always got turned over to my dad.  Finally he walked in and I got my most somber expression ready.  He sat down and told me that I would not be going to art lessons anymore.  I was heartbroken and he hesitated before explaining.  

Evidently, my father was with the police because he had to answer some questions regarding my art teacher.  She had tried to pick me up from school earlier in the day.  The office staff asked her for her name (which matched my mother's) and were about to call me up when one of the other teachers told them that she wasn't my mother.  My mom volunteered with my school a lot before she started working fulltime so the teacher recognized immediately that this women wasn't my mother and didn't have clearance to pick me up.  

She then called my dad's workplace and told him that she had me with her and that my mother was ""dealt with"".  She wouldn't tell him what she did but kept telling him that she loved him and we could be a wonderful family.  He stayed on the phone with her for awhile before telling her that she was right and he would be over after work to talk about everything.  Thankfully that teacher at my school thought it was odd and called my emergency contact numbers and the secretary at my dad's work gave him the message.  Now that he knew I was safe, he called my mom and confirmed she was ok before calling the cops.  

Everything ended up ok in the end.  She got the help she needed and as far as I know she's fine now.  She paints murals for businesses in the area.  I didn't even directly experience the creepiness but I do get a little weirded out when I see any of the work she's done.  "	t5_2t3t8	True
1342444071.0	wn3zd	A LARPer gone mad.	MorbidlyMacabre	385	63	91	"Holy cow, it's my cake day! And to celebrate, I present you this tale of nerdy horror.

I am a complete nerd and to prove this, I used to LARP heavily. You meet all kinds of people LARPing. The city I played in was near a military base, so there were a few Marines in our game. I'm a very outgoing person and make friends easily. I was well liked at Game and I guess I caught the eye of one LARPer named Nick Suarez. 

At first, we were just acquaintances. Just roleplaying vampires along with a group of other people. Then he introduced me to a friend of his who I ended up babysitting for a number of times. I became good friends with her because of this. 

Fast forward.

Nick, our mutual friend (Meli), her husband, another couple, and I all went out to a Puerto Rican club one night. I was very attached to my sexy Zune at the time and brought it with me everywhere. Well, me being the lush I am, I had drank a decent amount that night and gotten a ride back to my house from Nick. I ended up drunkenly leaving my Zune in his car. When I noticed it was missing, I called him up and asked him to return it. He came to my house to drop it off and stupidly told me he had come across a topless photo I took. Me + whiskey + camera = topless picture. At least at that time. But I digress. He told me he came across this picture while checking out my Zune ""to see if I wanted to buy one"" (his words). I tried to find the picture he was referring to. It turns out you had to scroll down to the 13th gallery and then scroll down to the last picture. Obviously he was scoping out my pictures.

I felt violated. I decided to ignore him because I was pissed that he invaded my privacy in a way. A week later, my friend Danyell (a mutual friend of Meli and I) was over at my house. We had a thing for each other at the time. I was dying my hair red, blue, and black that night and she was helping me. Around 10pm that night, Nick calls. I ignore the call. Then he called again. And again. Up until the point where he would call, I wouldn't pick up, and then he would call immediately after. I was flying out to Florida to see my biological family the next morning from an airport about 2-3 hours away. I decided to pick up the phone and fake being asleep. I tried to convince him I was asleep and I had a flight early tomorrow, which was bending the truth a bit. My flight wasn't THAT early in the morning. After I hung up the phone, he called back. Danyell had had enough. She picked up the phone (It was my cell phone, by the way) and told him off. When she hung up, we looked at each other and decided to go outside and have a cigarette.

So we go outside my house and talk about Nick and how convoluted it was that he wouldn't leave me alone. I live on a cul-de-sac and my parents' house is near the end of it. My back is to the street and Danyell is facing me. Mid sentence, her face changes expressions and she says ""What the hell?""

I turn around to look at the street and I see someone walking towards us down the street. It's Nick. I decide to meet him at the bottom of my driveway. He basically says it's bullcrap that I've been ignoring him and we need to discuss ""our problems"" by this time, Danyell is at my side and starts caressing my arm to give him a hint. This fellow isn't too bright and doesn't get it. Then he brings it down a notch. He quietly and softly says my name and that we should talk. I almost cave, but suddenly Danyell links arms with me and leads me back to my house. Our backs are to Nick and we're next to my parents' car. Danyell is on my left side. I see her go down on the hood of the car out of the corner of my eye and I hear Danyell scream ""Get your fucking hands off me!"", then I feel an arm around my neck and something pressed against my temple. At this point, I think I should be scared so I force myself to cry for effect. As I'm being pulled up the street, I realize there's a gun to my head. THAT'S when I really start to cry.

Meanwhile, Danyell has gone back in my house and alerted my parents to the situation. My brave younger sister ventures outside to see what exactly is going on. She sees Nick dragging me up the street and reports to my mom that he has a gun. My mom and my across the street neighbor both call 911 and my dad comes outside to mediate the situation. He saved my life that night...

Now at this point, things start to blur because I'm so damn terrified. 

My dad comes out and says something to Nick about letting me go or something. Around this time, my legs finally give out and I drop to the ground. Nick points the gun at my dad and says ""Stop or I'll shoot you!"" Then he points it at me and threatens to shoot me. Then like the dumbass he is, he points it to his own head and threatens to shoot himself. My dad is trying to talk Nick down and reason with him, all the while yelling at me to come back to the house where it's safer. I can't move. I'm literally frozen, crying and screaming hysterically. I finally find it in me to move, so I crawl to the sidewalk. Then a little while later, I get an adrenaline rush and run to my house. There's a big pile of dirt at the edge of my front yard where a fence used to be and of course I don't see it and I trip over it. By now, Danyell has come back outside and is hiding behind her car. I happen to fall near her and she drags me behind her car with her. I'm still crying and I can hear my dad scream ""No Nick, don't do that!"" I bust out crying harder then before. Then, I hear it. A helicopter. We're saved! Then a few minutes later, 5 cop cars come barrelling down my quite, little street. Eventually, Nick gives up and is apprehended. 

The cops then secure the scene. Danyell, my dad, and I are told to get down on our knees with our hands up. My dad and I have a Kodak moment at this time as we hold hands in midair. Fast forward to me giving my statement to the main police officer in charge. His cop car is at the top of the street. As I'm talking, I realize we're right next to Nick's car. I point it out to him.

In his car, the cops found ammunition, scarves, rope, a knife, and binoculars. Nick told the cops flat out what his plans were that night. Apparently, he was going to kidnap us, bind and gag us, rape Danyell and ditch her, and ""talk"" to me. I call shenanigans. I know if he had me against my will he would have his way with me.

Sorry for the length. I felt the need to go in to detail.

1370589632.0	1ful9l	My family lived with a cold-blooded killer for several months.. and we didn't even know.	birdytalks	385	64	52	"Prologue: I was 13 years old (I'm female, just for the record,) and my mom and her six-year boyfriend had just separated due to an extensive drug addiction on his part. They constantly fought whenever they were around each other, and things got pretty violent most of the time. There was constant physical and mental abuse. His drug addiction got so bad that we came home one day to find he had pawned off our furniture, television, and bedroom sets for drug money. Eventually, he ended up being caught driving under the influence and was sentenced to prison. My mother thought it'd be best to move my 9 year old brother and I into my grandmother’s house as our house was being foreclosed. (She couldn't make rent without her ex's income.) That being said, I didn't protest the move. I actually ended up getting better sleep in my grandma's house, since I was never woken up to any screaming. However, if I had known then what I do today--I would not have slept at all.


My grandma is a very selfless person, and she would have done anything for my mom, my brother, and I. She didn't have very much money at all, as she wasn't able to get a job due to extensive knee injuries she received in a car accident years before this. Her boyfriend Louie, however, SEEMED to be the breadwinner. He kept the bills paid, and he came and went as he pleased. He wasn't the friendliest of people, and boy was he lazy/sloppy. He always gave me a weird vibe.

In this 3 bedroom house lived: My mother, grandmother, Louie, my two aunts, and my brother and I. It was a full house, so to say. My brother and I shared a pull out couch in the living room, while my mom slept on a couch adjacent to us. Our move into the house occurred during summer vacation, so me and my brother always looked for something to do. On occasion Louie would take my brother to the nature trails by our house, and they'd go fishing. He had recently been laid off from his job, so in the time he didn’t spend watching TV in his tighty-whitey underpants, asleep, or cooking himself enough food to feed 7 armies--he actually felt like partaking in some physical activity. I usually stayed behind, as I didn’t really care for fishing at the time, and I didn’t particularly like him. 

One day I was using the bathroom and I dropped the toilet paper roll off the ring. I bent down to pick it up and noticed a stash of books against the cupboard. I reached and grabbed out more than a dozen pornography books. Quite obviously they were Louie’s. I panicked and I told my mom what I had found, because for some reason in my mind I thought he would somehow realize that they were moved from their spot. When my mom politely confronted him about it, he became belligerent. It escalated into a fight that resulted in him leaving for several days. When he returned, he became very violent towards everyone; especially my mother and her two sisters. 

On top of this, my mom had been storing all of our stuff (well, what was left of it) down in their basement. She took notice that a $1000 power saw that once belonged to her ex had gone missing. *Edit: Her ex wasn't able to pawn off the powersaw simply because he didn't know about it yet. It was hidden in our garage and meant to be a birthday present to him.* She wasn't sure if the neighbors had taken it (it was a duplex,) but she did suspect Louie. She already didn't like him due to his laziness, his nasty porn stash, and his growing attitude towards everyone in the house. She banned him from taking my brother on their fishing trips, and also began encouraging my grandma to break up with him. 

My grandma still decided to keep him around even though he started becoming very violent towards her as well. This all changed when my mom saw her powersaw in the window of a pawn shop. It had the same exact serial number that she had on the warranty papers. She asked the pawn shop who had sold the saw, and their description fit Louie perfectly. 

That was the final straw. My mom took charge and moved his things out. He became belligerent once again, and we ended up calling the cop and reporting a domestic violence. My mom explained the situation to the cops, and they had him gather all his belongings and leave the house. 

What we found out next still sends shivers down my spine. Louie was a recovering cocaine addict who had relapsed--and badly. He failed a drug test, so he actually LOST his job as opposed to being laid off. 
He moved to a tiny apartment complex soon after, and he finally stopped coming by the house and begging for our forgiveness (my mom was NOT having it.) 

Months went by and we all forgot about what had happened--until my grandma and my mom saw something on the news that stopped their hearts for a moment. A NY man was arrested for the murder of a Florida woman. The mugshot appeared on screen. It was Louie. Not only was he a drug addict, but he was a killer. 
Apparently he met the woman right after everything went down with my grandma, and a few months later he moved with her to Florida--where she was originally from. 

When the woman went missing, all her family members pointed fingers at him. They said he seemed crazy at times, and that he was very violent and aggressive towards her. They claimed they had urged her many times to break up with him, but she felt terrible that he was “laid off” and had moved all the way to Florida with her, so she refused.

Finally Louie snapped, and strangled the poor woman dead in her own home. *Edit: He made up stories during his testimonies about what REALLY happened. On one testimony he suggested that the woman ""might have died during rough sex that included strangulation."" What...the fuck.* Once she was dead then cut her body up into several pieces (presumably using an axe,) put them into a tarp, and stashed them in the trunk of her OWN car. He drove said car--with her body inside--to a storage garage in Wisconsin, and left it there for several months before it was finally discovered. When this woman went missing, the family pointed fingers at Louie, and a search went out for him. He was finally tracked down in Wisconsin, and arrested. He was proven guilty of second degree murder, and other charges such as grand theft auto. He was subsequently sentenced to life in prison, and to this day he rots in there. 


I just can't imagine what would have happened if my mom hadn't been so adamant about my grandma kicking him out. He was truly crazy.  My mom, aunts, my grandma, or I easily could have been in the place of that poor woman. Or even my poor brother! I later learned that on those “fishing trips,” he would get high on coke, and drive with my little brother around whilst being so. Easily the creepiest thing that I've been through.

When I was maybe 5 or 6, I was obsessed with Sailor Moon. Everyday I would lay down on the couch, belly down, and watch as Sailor Moon kicked butt!
One day, however, something really weird happened. My uncle came in and laid on top of me. I didn't know what was going on, so I sort of ignored him, just watching my cartoon, until I felt something poking me.
I went to sit up, but he held me down, and just as I was getting scared, my grandmother opened the door. My uncle got up really quickly and acted like nothing had happened. 
He never did it again, and I never mentioned it to my grandparents, because I didn't want to upset them.

**My stepfather**

Now, this is a bit creepier, in my opinion. My mother had moved me from Peru back to the states. I was maybe 9-10 years old, or around the 5th grade. 
Anyways, everything was fine for a while, until my mother began to physically abuse me.
That's where my step father comes in.
He would come into my room and tell me he would *protect* me from my mom if I did *things* for him.
These things made me really uncomfortable, but at first it was okay. However as time passed, he would often come up behind me while I was brushing my teeth and grind up against me, or he would come in at night and put his...*thing* in my hand. 
I remember I threatened to tell my mom, but he just laughed, because he knew I was terrified of her.
So things went on like this until...
It was maybe midnight, and he comes in, telling me ""Oh, it won't hurt..it'll feel good.."" And I'm terrified. I can feel him taking off my pants and then there was this pain. 
I had no idea what was going on, only that he was thrusting. I look over at the door, and what do I see?
*My mom, standing there, watching*.

Eventually, I broke down and told a guidance counselor, and I was taken away. 
I went to criminal court, but it was my word against two adults.
And, so he got off the hook.
So he's out there right now, roaming free.
I'm sorry if this isn't the right place for this story, or if it's not creepy enough.

TL;DR: Just because they're family, doesn't mean they won't hurt you."	t5_2t3t8	True
1359211660.0	17bdrs	Destined to be the bride of a cult leader... (x-post from r/talesfromretail)	likeyoualatte	366	45	43	"I posted this in r/talesfromretail and was encouraged to post it here as well.

Years ago, as a 17 year old, I worked at a deli in a grocery store. This grocery store was in a small town, so it seems as if we had a very concentrated amount of crazy people. I was really naive, and did not know how to say no to people, so I got into a lot of perplexing situations there.

For our uniforms we had to wear white button-up blouses, black pants, black aprons and a huge name tag. The name tag not only had our first names, but our last names as well. My first name is slightly unique, but my last name is uncommon. Basically, i'm really easy to find. You search my name in Google or Facebook, and I am the only one (as of now) that pops up. I was always really uncomfortable with people seeing my full name in such a public job.

An older man with big glasses, white beard and red plaid coat came in one day asking for something small. As I was dishing it up, I did my usual chatter with the customer. He was asking me a lot of really uncomfortable personal questions, but I wasn't quite catching on that he was getting creepy. I was a senior, and shared that with him. He asked me a few more things and he was on his merry way.
I promptly forgot about him. He came back in one week later, and asked me if he could take a picture of me. I did not know what to think of it, but I smiled and said that I belonged behind a camera, not in front of one. He had a nervous laugh and disappeared. About 15 minutes later, a coworker ran up to me and asked me if I just saw this old guy in a red plaid coat take a picture of me from behind this glass window we had by the entrance. It was really creepy, but I let it go.

About 2 weeks after this, he came back in and waited until I was free to speak to him. He told me that his name was something like (and this is not his real legal name, it was one he made up) ""Emmanuel Lamb Branch"". He asked me if I would like to go to his home out in the country every Thursday night and be his hostess for his ""readings"" that he had. He said he wanted a beautiful woman to greet his guests and be admired by his side. I told him thank you, but I worked two jobs and I valued my few nights a week that I had off and would rather spend them with family. In trying to convince me, he told me that he had a community of people that lived on his land, and they were all very peaceful. I turned him down again and moved to a customer waiting for me.

Later on that week Emmanuel Lamb Branch came back in with some flyers (apparently he had been going door-to-door) and handed them to me, told me he was waiting for me, and left. I read the literature on my break. One was a typed out love poem. It was very sexual. The next was some political flyer. I guess he was running for president or something. The third absolutely creeped me out. I wish I still had it to type it out for you word-for-word. Basically, it was informing people of the New Kingdom, and how Emmanuel Lamb Branch was the leader of the New Kingdom, and that he had a bride waiting for him. His bride was ME. He put my full stinkin' name in there and explained how he'd commissioned a local artist to paint a large portrait portraying me as his bride. Apparently it was sitting above his fireplace. He said that we were to have descendants who would rule the New Kingdom.

That was it. I'd had enough of him. I went home crying and asked my mom what to do. She immediately called the police and they issued a restraining order on him. They took all of my papers from him and talked to him. He told them that I wanted to be his bride, and was waiting until I was 18. EW.

Well, Emmanuel Lamb Branch still came into the store that I worked at for the next month. He would stand over by the magazines and would just watch me. For hours. It made me nervous. Finally a coworker alerted the store manager who told him he could never come back inside. No, he just stood outside the door.
Apparently that summer he was jailed for some violent behavior and I never saw him again.

TL;DR- Was nice to a crazy cult leader and somehow ended up being his bride. In a portrait, anyhow."	t5_2t3t8	True
1370009980.0	1fekua	The Laughing Bicyclist	colourevolt	376	53	94	"(Quick backstory: I am newly moved 21m into my house and am still not 100% familiar with my own neighborhood yet. The way the neighborhood was built makes it a rectangular shape laying down on it's long side (with my house being at the top right corner of it). Sorry if that's confusing, I can clarify later if needed.

So, the other night around 2:30am I was at my house alone when I decided to take a break from playing guitar and have a smoke before bed. So, I grabbed a smoke and started out my front door. 

About 3 or so minutes into my cig, I notice this faint noise of what sounds like an old creaky metal object that needs to get oiled, but the sound has a cadence which makes it repeat every two or three seconds. After this happens for about 10 seconds, I notice that I can hear tires gripping the road as well. Then, out of nowhere, I see a man, who looks to be in his mid 40s, riding this horribly beaten down bike that emitted a very intense, ear-piercing, high-pitched squeak every time he peddled. As I stood in my driveway and he passed me, he kept moving forward, but his head slowly rotated left and he locked eyes with me. I am not kidding when I say that this guy looked IDENTICAL to Hannibal Lecter from the movies. But that's not what made my heart drop. As I am locking eyes with him and he is moving past my driveway, he suddenly gives me the scariest, most widest, SCARIEST jagged-toothed smile I have ever seen in my life. And continues to lock eyes with me. And this wasn't an ordinary smile; I'm talking a ""When The Grinch Stole Christmas"" EAR TO EAR SMILE. Within 15 more seconds, he continues peddling and is out of sight. I can now just faintly hear his bicycle gears squeaking.


At this point I am wondering whether or not he is going around my rectangular block of a neighborhood and whether or not I can chief this cig fast enough to get inside before he comes around again. As I am doing this, I begin to hear the metal *creeaaaaaaak* noise, but I also hear something different. I hear this dude laughing like a fucking maniac which made me NOPE the fuck outta there. As I am stumbling for my door handle (because of the adrenaline rush) he begins to round the turn where my door is almost in view. At the exact moment where I would've become visible, I got my door opened, ran in, and slammed it shut/locked. No sooner does my door close do I hear the man from outside scream, as loud as can be: ""WHERE'D YA GO!?! HAHAHA!""

At this point I went into full-out battle mode. Ran around my house and turned all the lights off. Battle-crawled to my bedroom and waited. As I lay in my bed for the next 30 minutes I would hear the squeaking of the bike for about 30 seconds every 3-4 minutes. About 30-45 mins later, it finally stopped and the man was gone.

I have actually quit smoking since then and haven't been outside that late. But every now and then, around 2:30am, I can still hear the squeaking of the bicycle from the outside of my room window."	t5_2t3t8	True
1372878391.0	1hl2bl	Candy Store Stalking	Miko93	375	54	27	"This happened to me years ago, in about 7th grade, around age 12.

I was hanging out in my town's downtown area with 3 of my friends(all female). We live in a pretty safe area so it's normal for groups of kids to hang out and walk around like that after school. 

We end up in this local candy store which is generally pretty crowded, so we didn't notice him at first. We're walking around the store together, talking and looking at all the different candies, gag gifts, etc. That's when I notice there's this guy walking behind us, obnoxiously close. He kind of sticks out in this store. He's alone, in his late 20s/early 30s, wearing one of [these](http://www.siestacrafts.co.uk/__uploads/Catalog/2140_large_image_BA088_Rice_Padi_Hat.jpg) hats.

At first, we think that maybe he's just sort of meandering the store like we were. It's pretty crowded and the aisles are narrow so it's hard not to bump into people. Just to be sure, we stop browsing and start making a crazy zigzag path through the aisles. He follows with every step.

With that, we subtly send one of my friends to talk to someone who works at the store. 

The cashier confronts the man and asks ""Do you know these girls?""
And to the effect of utterly creeping us out, he responded ""Maybe..."" in a way that still gives me chills.

Subsequently, we see the guy leave-as he was kicked out- and head down the street to the left. With that, we bolt to the right, heading back towards my friends house. I look back, and the guy has turned around and is following us again, but at a distance. Freaking out and not wanting him following us into a more isolated neighborhood, we look for a store to turn into.

To our relief, Benefit, a cosmetics store, is on our right. It's pretty open and would be highly unusual for a man to be in there on his own. We hope this has forced him to give up, but instead, he stands outside the store, waiting for us. Eventually, a salesperson there asks us if we need anything and we tell her about the man outside.

She goes out, and completely bitches him out and sends him on his way. We call my friend's mom and have her pick us up, rather than walking home, even though I'm pretty sure he is actually gone this time.

I'm  grateful for the people that day and the fact that we were in a group. He obviously had some mental issues I cannot fathom what would have happened had we and the people around us acted differently. I've never seen him again since that incident."	t5_2t3t8	True
1352004504.0	12lltq	I am glad I didn't meet this person.	haiduc89	386	61	27	I was 11 or 12 and just arrived at home after a day at school.  As per usual, I dumped my book bag on the floor next to the door and went straight to use the toilet.  Finished up as normal, then went to the computer, looking forward to playing around on Neopets.com like the average kid of my age.  I flicked on the computer screen and my heart jumped into my throat.  My desktop wallpaper had been changed to an image of a female's leg, naked except for a black lace-up heel and covered in blood.  There were HUNDREDS of images saved to the desktop of gore and extreme BDSM scenes.  I didn't know if there was still someone in the house with me, and I BOLTED out the door and called the police and my parents.  According to the police and search history, someone had broken into our house just minutes after we all left for the day, spent all day looking at porn and gore images up until when I came home.  They had still been in the house while I was peeing and must have used that moment to bail.  They were never caught, but needless to say, we moved soon after then.	t5_2t3t8	True
1370475181.0	1fr7dw	My dad is the reason someone is probably terrified to go into the woods at night...	4t2l2t	382	62	35	"One night my dad was the creep, and now there are about 10 teenagers in Czech that are terrified of the woods at night. Although they were douches, so it's alright. 

Let me explain. 

I go to school in the US, but all of my extended family lives in the Czech Republic. Every year that we go back, my uncles and aunts throw a party for us in their mountain house. This house is up in the mountains, very secluded from other houses. 

One night we were all sitting outside around a campfire and our neighbors, albeit quite far were being RIDICULOUSLY loud. They are Czech, aka. they were drunk. Yelling, swearing, shooting off fire crackers; the works. My cousin had just put her toddler down to sleep, and was worried that they would wake him up, so my dad decides to walk over there to ask them to be quiet. 

My dad was really polite about it and they seemed apologetic so my dad left and returned to our campfire. Naturally, in about ten minutes they were just as loud, this time yelling thing to us telling us to not be party poopers, shooting firecrackers in our direction,  that we are jealous we aren't having as much fun, blah blah blah. After about ten minutes of them not dying down my dad decides to take action. 

My dad is 6'6 and 230 pounds of pure muscle (he was an athlete) so he's in incredible shape and just a very imposing man. He takes his shirt off and puts on this mask that my uncle just so happened to have laying around. This mask was human faced, but it was a very distorted and really creepy, kind of like this:  http://www.techeblog.com/index.php/tech-gadget/creepy-ultra-realistic-human-face-mask 

He goes to the shed and takes the ax and decides he's going to scare these drunk assholes.

The property that they were on is shaped like a square with dense forest completely covering the outskirts. Their fire was right in the middle. My dad slowly walks from the forest, but never ventures further toward the camp, and simply slowly walks the perimeter, swinging the ax and staring at the fire. 

We heard the drunk guys screaming and swearing and my dad came back laughing, saying that he had never seen teenagers run that quickly. 

Not surprisingly, the rest of the trip in the mountain house was peaceful without the noise of our drunken teenage neighbors. Probably because they were too busy locked in their house, shitting themselves. 

Sorry if there are errors, English isn't my first language!

1375620338.0	1joepx	ALWAYS change your locks.	AnErinWithAnE	358	43	58	"OK. So I'm new to this subreddit but I definitely have a story that belongs here. The year was 2010, I was a freshly divorced 23 year old, living in northern Louisiana on my own two-story apartment with my wonderful dog. I had moved in just a month prior, and was enjoying the peace and quiet, a fresh start after an emotionally crippling time in my life.

It was a pleasant Sunday afternoon, summertime in Louisiana. I had decided to escape the heat by staying inside to watch a few episodes of *It's Always Sunny* with my dog, Kingsley in my lap. The sun was shining through my windows, which in this complex took up half the living room wall, floor to near ceiling. I had blinds, but had decided to adjust them so some natural light would come in.

Now, the neighborhood wasn't so bad. It wasn't the best, but you definitely didn't leave anything outside, and you always lock your house and your car. I had seen my share of shady activity, so regardless of the time of day, my doors and windows were locked. It had also come to my attention that my ex had done drive-by's of my new place, and not wanting to be caught off-guard, I was constantly checking that I had locked everything.

A beat up car pulled into the parking lot, which i could see out of my peripheral, across from a grassy area in front of my building. I guess I didn't think anything of it at the time, but I didn't recognize the driver who stepped out.

Until he walked in front of my window, staring *directly* inside my living room.

The bushes in front of my windows were maybe waist-high on me (I'm 5'4""), so this man was clearly staring. RIGHT AT ME. As in, we made eye contact. No blinking, and there was no mistake --  he saw I was inside, by myself. 

From what I saw between the blinds, he was EASILY 6 feet tall. Heavyset, bald, with dark eyebrows and a goatee. He wore a short-sleeve button up shirt over a dark t-shirt and jeans. I had never seen him in our complex before.

Kingsley's head shot up, ears perked, his fur standing up on his neck. He was a friendly, playful dog, and loved meeting everyone. But when I felt a low grumble from his stomach when he bolted up off the couch, I knew this wasn't a stranger he wanted to meet.

My heart raced and I felt my palms tingle with anxiety. My cellphone was in my pocket, within easy reach. Kingsley sat in my lap, now growling, his paws nervously twitching. The door was locked, no way he could get in, right? 

...WRONG.

When I heard a key in the lock, I remember feeling many things at once- my heart stopped and jumped in my throat. My scalp felt like it was on fire, but my hands felt cold. Who was this guy?? Why, of all fucking things, did he have a key to my apartment??

I didn't have a gun. The front door was 6 feet to my left, the kitchen at least 15 to my right; I didn't have time to run and grab a knife, especially since I didn't know whether this guy was armed or not. I didn't have a baseball bat, and I doubt throwing my nearby shoes would deter a home intruder of his size.

The door cracked open.

I panicked.

Kingsley let out the loudest bark I had ever heard and in one leap was snarling at the door, his teeth bared, ready to attack. For the split second the door was open, I saw the man's eyes widen and he shut the door.

*AND HE KNOCKED ON THE DOOR*. I shit you not, this man KNOCKED on the door. After he had already opened it, with a key he somehow had.

Kingsley was busy, jumping at the door, letting out vicious growls, not acting at all like the giant goofball I knew him to be. I jumped up after him, grabbed his collar, and with the other hand grabbed the doorknob and opened it just enough for Kingsley to poke his head out.

""Can I help you with something?"" My voice shook. Anger and fear coursed through my veins.

""I'm here to pick up my mail. I'm expecting a package. I used to live here,"" the man said, matter-of-factly, as if this was something I should have known. What the fuck? 

""You don't live here anymore. I LIVE HERE. I don't have your mail"" Seriously?? Our mailboxes were at the apartment main office.

""I was EXPECTING a package from FedEx. I WANT my package."" He took a half step forward, seeming impatient, angry, expecting somehow that I would have his mysterious mail and invite him in? NOPE.

Actually, 3 days prior, FedEx *did* come by with an envelope, but as the name on it wasn't mine, I told the delivery guy and never accepted it. Still, did he really expect me to believe that the FedEx guy left him a package *in* an apartment he no longer resided in?

""They came by with something a few days ago. But it wasn't mine, so I made them take it back."" I responded. 

His face went red and his fists clenched.

PANIC PANIC PANIC

""WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?? THAT IS MY PACKAGE AND I WAS EXPECTING IT!!!"" He exploded, waving his arms, as if I was to blame. Kingsley leapt up, nearly dragging me out of the door. I yanked him back. The man continued his rant.

""I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WOULD DO SOMETHING SO FUCKING STUPID! NOW I HAVE TO GO TRACK IT DOWN MYSELF! DO YOU KNOW WHAT A WASTE OF TIME THIS IS??""

I was frantic at this point, I didn't know where this dude came from, why he still had a key to this place, WHY, when he saw me in the living room with a dog, he tried to come in, and WHY of all things was he freaking out over a stupid envelope.

""LOOK man, I don't have your package, just call fucking FedEx and take care of it yourself!"" The words sounded better in my head; out loud they sounded shaky and fearful and I knew my lack of courage was a terrible disadvantage in this situation.

""I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS SHIT!!!"" He was completely red, flailing around in rage.

""YOU GOTTA LEAVE!"" I yelped, trying with all my might to keep a hold of poor Kingsley. ""I'M GOING TO CALL THE COPS!"" I finally shouted out, figuring this would deter the now furious stranger in front of my door.

For a split second, his eyes widened, and he took a step back.

""I'll be back."" He gulped, and turned around. I froze, and Kingsley let out a few growls. I patted him and shut the door, locking it, unlocking, then locking it again. 

I put him on a leash, grabbed my keys and hurried to the front office. I told them what had just happened. I let them know the police would be notified, and demanded they change the locks, and install a chain, NOW. No way was I waiting for thay psycho to come back.

He never did.

To this day, regardless of where I live, I keep my car, windows, and doors locked, and I double check when I leave the house and go to bed. Thanks asshole, it's been three years and the paranoia persists."	t5_2t3t8	True
1375535523.0	1jmhr2	Randomly found this and immediately remembered something creepy that happened to me when I was younger	J_heather1204	374	57	37	I am a frequent reader of nosleep, and through reading some comments on a story I found this subreddit. An incident happened to me when I was about 13 years old, and I haven't really thought about it since then seeing as how that was 7 years ago. I remember thinking it was weird but not really fully understanding HOW creepy/scary it was until now that I'm trying to remember as many details about it as I can. Anyway, I was taking a walk with my dog and was on my way back home. About a block away from my house my neighbor, who was driving his pickup truck, decided to stop and talk to me. I remember thinking it was kind of weird because I was expecting to just wave and keep going but he completely stopped and to have a full (pointless and random) conversation with me. Eventually he went on his way and I got home a few minutes later to the surprise that he was in my kitchen with my parents as if they were all waiting for me to come back. Turns out he was driving by when he saw me walking my dog while a middle aged random guy was following quietly behind. This was when he chose to drive up and talk to me thus causing the guy to leave. I'm particularly creeped out because this was so close to my house and I don't know how long he was following me for, or what would have happened if my neighbor drove by a few minutes too late and this creep was able to watch me walk home and find out where I lived. 	t5_2t3t8	True
1368673386.0	1effif	As if rape isn't bad enough...	thebonerslayer	391	77	65	"When I was 15 I had my first job. My coworker, we'll call him Rob, was simply incredible. He was handsome, smart, funny, sweet and I was in ""puppy love"". He was also four years older than me, and addicted to heroin. In my 15 year old mind, that didn't matter. I was going to marry him, have his babies, the whole white picket fence dream. 

He had a friend who also worked with us, we'll call him Tim. Tim had a crush on me. He was three years older than me, kinda heavy, creepy and aggressive. He was a heavy partier, and a huge flirt. He used to sneak up on me, and tickle me, or pick me up (despite my protests). Once while he was picking me up, he dropped me. I fractured my tailbone and cracked 2 vertibrae.

I dealt with Tim because I was in love with Rob. In January of 2006, Rob overdosed. I dont remember much from the funeral, except that Tim held me as I sobbed, and he told me that we'd get through it, together.

Fast forward a few months, Tim starts calling me and texting me, asking me to sneak out and smoke with him. I did a few times, but he was always trying to get me to blow him, so I stopped. 

The day of my 17th birthday, my parents left me at home while they went out with my siblings. I should mention, my mom was constantly leaving the front door unlocked. Tim calls and says he has a gift for me and that he wanted to talk about Rob, as we were both still hurting. I told him my parents would be home soon, that he should wait until then. He knew my moms bad habit and walked right in. I won't get into the details about what exactly happened (its still painful to think about) but long story short, he raped me. I was a virgin.

I didn't call the police. I didn't tell my parents. I didn't tell anyone. Instead I attempted suicide. I was committed for most of that year. When I turned 18, he contacted me through facebook. I ignored him. He came to my new job, to my school, always trying to talk to me as if nothing happened, saying that now I was legal, I owed him a chance.

One day, after like 6 months of him following me around it randomly stopped. I was glad.

Then he started picking my 14 year old sister up from school. She told me he had promised to buy her things if she would sneak out to see him in the middle of the night. I lost my mind, 1 sister wasn't enough he had to go for a second?

I called him and asked him to come get me told him that we would hang out and smoke. I took my knife with me. I told him to leave her the hell alone, that I would remove any trace of manhood if he didn't.

He agreed to stop pursuing her, but started stalking me again. I changed my number, blocked him on Facebook and moved. He found me, started coming to my job everyday. I moved again, this time to a different state. 

Since then, about 4 years, I have moved back, I told my parents what happened, and for the most part he leaves me alone. When I see him, he still tries to talk to me, I tell him to fuck off."	t5_2t3t8	True

This afternoon, about three hours ago, I was waiting at a bus stop, listening to my iPod, when I heard loud yelling. Loud enough for me to hear over the music. I turned and saw two people walking down an interstate off-ramp. That was weird. Then I realized the person in front, a woman, was running, and the man was chasing her. They yelled and struggled a little bit, but I couldn’t really see what was going on because I was too far away and a street sign partially blocked my view. 


I noticed that when the light changed, two cars remained parked on the ramp – a tan SUV, possibly a Ford Explorer, and a small tan sedan with its hazard lights flashing. The sedan was parked behind the SUV. The guy grabbed the woman and pulled her into the backseat of the SUV and they continued down the ramp. At the end of the ramp, at the traffic light, the SUV continued north, passing me at the bus stop. The sedan, which may have just been someone trying to help for all I know, turned right, heading east on another street.  


As the SUV passed me, I noticed that the woman was still yelling, and that there were at least two other people in the car – a driver, and the guy who had grabbed her. The guy who grabbed her was sitting with her in the backseat, her in the middle and him closest to me, against the door. They quickly pulled into the driveway of the gas station I was standing in front of, but didn’t stop. They went down to the next entrance and I figured they would head back the way they’d come, back to the interstate, but they didn’t. Instead, the driver went right, further north down the road. The road curved, and I lost sight of them. 


I didn’t know what to do, or what I'd seen, but after a minute, a cop car pulled into the gas station (they’re right down the block – the SUV actually drove past the police department). At first, I think they thought I was the girl (both of us had dark hair, wearing a white shirt), but I told them what I’d seen. Then I watched as several more patrol cars showed up and cops started filling the parking lot. Then the bus came, so I left, but when I got home, I called the non-emergency line to make sure I had told them everything. 


As of yet, I haven’t found any news either broadcast local news or online. If I find anything, I will update.  


Here’s a link to map showing the approximate location of myself, the cars, and the paths each took.  The blue circle is the corner bus stop, where I stood. The red circle is where the woman and man struggled. The brown line is the path the tan SUV took once the woman was inside, and the green line at the bottom is the path the sedan took when the light changed. Like I said, I don’t know if the sedan was really involved. I’m thinking it might be a good Samaritan who stopped when they saw what was going on, and they likely were the ones to report the incident first. 


This happened at the I-20 off-ramp at Benton Spur and Old Minden Road in Bossier City, LA. 


[IMG]http://i40.tinypic.com/abi4a1.png[/IMG] 


Update: Apparently, I'm the only witness now. The first person to call in didn't leave any contact info, so all they have to go on is my story. I just got a call from an officer who said they didn't find the SUV or the girl. I still don't know what happened.

I had been working for about a year at the gas station right across from my university with my brother. One night, this girl comes in with her head down. Almost like she's ashamed of something. I don't think anything of it. She grabs a soda and some candy and comes to my counter. I happen to glance outside to see that someone has pulled up behind her car in the parking lot. I think it's a little strange and say to her, ""One of your friends blocking you in for a laugh or something?"" She looks back and I can see her body tense up. She whispers very quietly to me, ""That's my ex-boyfriend."" I look at my brother and tell him to go scare the guy off. My brother... forever the goofy bastard just says, ""You do it.""

I grab the bat from under the counter and head outside. I point the bat at his car and yell, ""Get out of here, you fucking creep!"" and he pulls out so fast that he almost hit my truck trying to get out of the parking lot. I make note of where he drove off to, and where he turned. I go back inside and the girl keeps saying thank you. I tell her she's welcome, tell her where he's gone and ask if it's anywhere close to where she lives. She tells me no, and she's going straight home. I ask if the cops need to be called, and she says no. She leaves shortly after, and I've never seen her since. I really hope nothing happened. And I kind of wish I had bashed that guys windshield in. What a creepy asshole."	t5_2t3t8	True
1354818319.0	14e8kr	Housemate Spanks Self, Leaves Bloody Knife in the Dishwasher, and Other Fun Things	nnnnnnnnope	369	54	76	"This story benefits from a little bit of background, so let's start with my freshman year of college.

I met Emily via my freshman orientation group. We were both theatre majors, and, eager to make friends and feel less awkward and alienated in the overwhelming flurry of early university life, got on quite well. She was maternal and gentle and sweet, always going out of her way to make sure everyone was doing all right and felt included. We spent the first few weeks of that year hanging out in my dorm room, watching cartoons and youtube videos and talking. We had a ton of common interests, and I was really happy that I'd met her.

However, as freshman year went on, Emily's sweet demeanor started cracking. Emily and her roommate Beth lived across the hall from me, so I got to be close with Beth as well. Beth would confide in me about the weird and upsetting things Emily did: she would randomly start sobbing and scream at Beth when she asked if she was okay, belittle Beth in front of other people... One week, we had two fire drills in a row because a girl in our hall's hair straightener set off the alarm. Emily started loudly screaming about how this girl's straightener should be taken away from her and how she as an awful, conceited bitch--right outside of said girl's door. Beth told her to Emily to calm down, and this offended Emily so much that when Beth got back from class that afternoon, Emily had constructed a cardboard partition between her half of the room and Beth's.

This behavior culminated with me and my freshman year roommate standing outside of Emily's door one night, having to talk her out of slitting her wrists. We should've called the cops that night. It would've saved us years of trouble.

After that suicide attempt though, Emily started to shape up. Me, Emily, Beth, and my freshman year roommate, Kitty, decided to all live together in a suite the next year since we got along so well. Sophomore year went quite smoothly.

Junior year--this year--the four of us were going to live in a house together. However, a month before we were to move in, Kitty sent us a text message saying that she couldn't live in the house for ""financial"" reasons. It smelled fishy, but what could we do? We got another roommate, Roxi, who was going to share a room with Emily, since the house only had three bedrooms and Beth and I had claimed the singles.

Emily started causing problems as soon as we'd all moved in. She was ridiculously anal about cleaning, literally screaming at us and throwing things if we left a grain of rice in the sink or an empty coffee cup on the counter. She rearranged the fridge at three in the morning, in the process throwing out a lot of my food. I confronted her about it when I realized most of my groceries were missing, and she said, ""Oh, I thought they were mine and had gone bad!"" She then proceeded to give me an absurd amount of money to replace the groceries, far more than I would need. She constructed a thirty-item chore chart for us, telling us to do everything on it, every day. 

This behavior, coupled with her penchant for coming home angry from her job and screaming and throwing things around (regardless of whether we had guests over), drove Roxi, Beth, and I to the point of insanity. We confronted her about it, which culminated in a big fit of angry screaming and tears on her part. She got in my face and screamed at me for an hour, but eventually we decided that we would try hard to keep the house cleaner for her, and she would be less threatening and abrasive all the time.

We had about a week of happy, family-like living before shit really hit the fan. One Saturday in mid-October, we spent the afternoon decorating our house for Halloween. It was great. Emily had to go to work, but she said she would be back at 11:00 and we could watch a movie together. I was charge artist for a play at the time, so I had a ton of painting to do. I spent the rest of the day painting, and was still working in the theatre at four in the morning, when Beth, haggard and clad in pajamas, showed up. Worried, I asked her what was going on, and she simply said that I needed to come home right now. ""Something was up with Emily.""

As we walked back to the house, she explained the situtation: Emily had staggered through the front door at 3:50AM. She stumbled up to the room she shared with Roxi, where her banging into walls managed to wake Roxi up. Emily began screaming and tearing off all of her clothes, yelling variants of, ""I want to kill myself! I want to die! Someone kill me!"" Butt naked, Emily got on her bed, still screaming and crying about wanting to die, and began spanking herself. The spanking went on for about fifteen minutes--while Roxi laid there in the dark, horrified--until Emily collapsed, moaning and sobbing. Her moans eventually subsided, and she passed the fuck out, completely unresponsive.

Roxi gathered up her blanket and pillow, ready to sleep downstairs for the night, when she met Beth in the hallway. She explained what had happened to Beth. The two of them tried to wake Emily up--shaking her, turning the lights on and off, calling her name--but she was totally unconscious. They were worried, and that's why they came to get me. I was worried too, given Emily's history of suicide attempts, and the fact that she said she'd be home at 11:00 to hang out but instead stumbled home at 3:50. When they went downstairs, they saw that Emily had pulled up the Game of Thrones DVD menu screen to the words ""Winter is coming,"" and, as goofy as it sounds, we wondered if it was a suicide note (Emily would do that kind of thing). There were small pieces of paper and pairs of scissors all over the floor.

I tried to rouse Emily when Beth and I got back to the house, but she was out. She was breathing faintly, but her body was cold to the touch. We called an ambulance, just to get things checked out. We were afraid Emily had tried to overdose, or she had mixed something else with alcohol and reacted badly to it (she got crossfaded once and spent the night throwing up all over herself). We tried to dress Emily before the paramedics arrived, but gave up due to her being dead weight--however, in the process of trying to sit her up so we could get some clothes on her, we noticed that her ass was covered in oozing red welts from how hard she had been spanking herself.

She woke up while the paramedics were examining her and drunkenly explained to them that while she had a history of depression, no, she'd never kill herself... The paramedics told us that we were good friends for having them come check her out, but she was just hammered and needed some time to sober up. They offered to take her to the mental hospital to be on suicide watch for the night, but we said we could watch her. We were just so relieved she was only drunk. Another decision we would come to regret, as it were.

We were sitting in the living room after the medics left, when Emily stomped down the stairs, face twisted into an inhuman expression of horror. ""WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?"" She screamed. She was zipping a black jacket over just a bra.

She proceeded to scream at us for two hours while we tried to explain our rationale. Roxi explained to Emily how she had been spanking herself and screaming that she wanted to kill herself.
""I do want to kill myself!"" Emily replied. ""There isn't a second of the day that goes by that I don't want to die."" Roxi and I, having both dealt with severe depression for most of our lives, tried to explain to Emily that she should get help. There was no reason to keep being miserable all the time when antidepressants and therapy were options. 

In response to this, Emily crawled across the floor on all fours, and wrapped both arms around my leg (I was sitting in a chair and she was on the floor, both arms wrapped around the joint of my knee, squeezing so hard, it bruised). Digging her fingers into my flesh, she delivered a rehearsed-sounding monologue about how, over the summer, she had stood by the highway, willing herself to jump in front of an oncoming eighteen wheeler. ""But,"" she concluded, with a bitter laugh, ""I just didn't want to ruin their night.""

She started trying to provoke all of us into anger, telling us how that if we were passed out and unresponsive, she'd be a good friend and NOT call the medics for us! She proceeded to tell us how we were monsters and how waking up to a medical examination was like being raped. I was getting so angry about this that I excused myself to my room, afraid I'd react violently if I stayed down there any longer.

Emily came into my room about an hour later. When I went up to her, a knife in my pocket (just to be safe), she grabbed me by the neck and started kissing me on the mouth, around my face, breath reeking of vodka. She squeezed the flesh on the nape of my neck, digging her fingernails into me, and began telling me how she had resented me ever since freshman year. She hated that I was pretty and likable and talented and that I wasn't constantly miserable like her. She hated me since the day she met me. Just pouring abuse on me while she continued to hold me and kiss me against my will. I managed to push her away, and she told me she was going to move out--which I said was a good idea.

After that, though, is where the titular events take place. She left my room and went down to the living room, where, despite my being upstairs, in my room, with the door closed, I could hear her simultaneously sobbing and cackling. It was a ragged, pained crying, then turning into Wicked Witch-like laughter. She then began spanking herself again, so loudly I could hear it like it was happening right outside my door. Though I couldn't hear this, she also trashed the living room, punching and breaking our window blinds and throwing paper and furniture all over. The icing on the cake though was that she took a 10"" serrated carving knife and cut deep, crooked gashes all over her arms and legs. She then stuck the knife, still covered in her blood, in the dishwasher, with the rest of our dirty dishes.

Roxi, Beth, and I consulted our landlord the next day. It took Emily about a week to get moved out, and in the meantime, we went to the police, got a restraining order against her, and spent a few days living in ""protective housing"" in an unfurnished basement. We're back in the house now, sans Emily, and we have the locks changed. We haven't interacted with her since, and I hope I never have to. A few weeks ago, she did try to run Roxi over at a crosswalk, but Roxi fortunately escaped and though we told the police, not much happened. It was a horrifying experience and definitely left us all pretty traumatized. I really hope Emily gets help, but, well, I'm not gonna be the one that gets it for her.

Tl;dr housemate is super emotionally abusive, and this culminates in her spanking herself and cutting herself in the living room"	t5_2t3t8	True
1348344011.0	10b70h	I was date-rape-drugged, but thankfully not date raped.	Theriskyclick	373	62	68	"When I was 22, I lived in a semi-hip, semi-sketchy part of Brooklyn known as South Williamsburg.  I lived in a 2 bedroom apartment with a lesbian roommate named Toni (we didn't get along very well), and I regularly went on dates with guys I met online.  Most of these dates were nothing to post online about, but then there was the time I met Dave.  Dave and I agreed to meet for a few drinks at my favorite bar, which was called Barcade.  This bar was amazing because it had dozens of American microbrews on tap, and also because the entire (large) space was filled with 80's arcade games, which were all still a quarter a play.  I'm talking Ms. Pac-Man, Galaga, Space Invaders, 1942, Tapper (my fave), Gauntlet, you name it.  What I didn't realize is the decision to meet at this particular bar possibly saved my life. 
So I met him at Barcade, ordered a beer, cashed in $2 in quarters, and challenged him to a few games.  We started out having fun, playing in turns and cheering the other on, but after a few rounds of Punch-out, he started getting antsy.  A lot of ""do you want to take this back to my place?"", and ""let's get out of here"", etc.  I blew him off and didn't think anything of it at first, since I still had quite a few quarters left and just thought he was anxious to get in my pants.  I finished my first beer and ordered a second, which is usually my limit for sobriety (I'm small).  Then my favorite game opened up, and I excitedly ran for it, put a quarter in, and...I SUCKED.  I just couldn't time anything right, I kept missing the cues, and didn't make it past the first round.  This was weird, since I pretty much lived on this game, and beat everyone I challenged on it.  When I mentioned with wounded pride that I'm normally not this bad after only one beer, he started to get even more insistent.  ""No seriously, let's go, this place is too crowded for good conversation.  Let's go somewhere quieter.""  I didn't understand, since we'd only been there for like half an hour, and I was interested in having some fun, but I also wanted to get to know him first.  I again insisted on using up my quarters, of which I had two left.  I put another one in the game, determined to kick his ass, and this time not only could I not make it past the first round, but I had trouble even holding onto the joystick correctly.  This was when I started putting two and two together.  I realized I was in a really bad situation, and needed to play it cool, so I did what any normal 22 year old would do: I excused myself to the bathroom and proceeded to flip the fuck out.  
I called my roommate and begged her to come get me; we only lived a few blocks away, but she was at her girlfriend's house in Park Slope (15 minute cab ride), and was in the middle of a date.  I begged her and offered to pay for their next date plus the cost of the cab ride and finally she agreed to come get me.  While I waited, I just hung out in the bathroom, getting more and more freaked out, losing more and more of my fine motor skills as the minutes went by.   As women came into the bathroom, I kept asking them to check if he was still there; for the first 20 minutes he was; after that, people kept coming back saying he was gone.  I still didn't feel safe leaving the bathroom, though.  I stayed there, on the phone with my friend in North Carolina, waiting for Toni to show up.  After an hour, she walked in, and carried me out of the bar.  (I was able to walk with assistance, so it was more like a leaning carry, if you can follow me here).  She was still upset about me interrupting her date though, so instead of taking me back to the apartment, she took me to a gay bar nearby, the Metropolitan.  I got parked on a chair for the next hour while she partied with some friends, I think. (Honestly, my memory of this is a little hazy, I just know we were there.)  All I remember next is waking up in my bed in the middle of the night, but having crazy cramps and spasms all over my body and not being able to control it; then I don't remember anything else until the next morning, where my only remaining symptom was a really bad headache.
I never heard from Dave again, although I did get a phone call two days later from a blocked number, where a woman yelled epithets and curses at me for 30 seconds before threatening to kill me and hanging up.  I don't know why, but I'm convinced the two events are connected.  Either way, that's my story.  I was drugged, but not raped, and I am forever thankful.  **TL:DR: Video games saved me from being date-raped.**"	t5_2t3t8	True
1375185369.0	1jccy2	[Advice] Reading some of these stories, sounds like you kids need to get schooled	throwawaysecond2	379	69	45	"Background on me:  

I post on an alt because I don't want to be recognized. The reasons for this are multiple and will become apparent as you read my advice.  

Throughout my life my family and myself have been target of kidnapping and such crimes due to the nature of my parent's work. My father is high up in the corporate ladder, as is my mother. My mother unkowingly worked for years for a front for organized crime, later becoming the whistleblower that tore down the operation after she rose through the ranks and noticed the dark dealings of the enterprise. This experience gave her the training for her current job, which I am not at liberty to discuss.  

**Because of all these factors, my upbringing has included training by security proffesionals, their advice is nothing out of the ordinary, but it needed to become habit in my case.**  

As a family, we have an extensive experience experiencing both sides of crime. My father has been kidnapped twice, I have been kidnapped once (the abducters had no idea of my family connections and the experience lasted for a couple of days after they emptied my dummy bank account). Attemped kidnappings on myself ammount to 4, attempted muggings to one. A grand total of about 6 attempted (failed) abductions summing up all attempts on all family members.  

Now that's out of the way, let me begin with some of the advice which you are welcome to take to the extent you like, as a lot this advice is really for severe cases depending on the safety of where you live and what your demographic is.  
  
* **Don't be a target.** Do not draw attention to yourself in public in any way, shape or form. Being oblivious to your surroundings makes you a target and not many people realize this (take off your fucking earphones, you need your ears to be safe). This includes but is not limited to texting/reading/having earphones with loud music in your car or public transortation. Non-targeted crimes are usually done to non-aware targets, muggers and pick pockets love people that are glued to their ipods, kidnappers love the guys who will stay a minute more in their car to listen to music/read/make out or whatever. Wait until you're in your house.  
**I can't stress it enough, earphones of any kind while in the street or public transportation is a gigantic neon sign telling people you're not paying attention.**  
If you're relatively wealthy and know you might be a target to crime, don't flaunt your wealth (put away your ipad on the subway, for example). I know an extremely wealthy high profile man that drives a car that is purposely tacky so he is not recognized or targeted (an extreme case of this, of course).  
Keep your conversations with friends in public transportation discrete, and by no means disclose personal information, specially full names, addresses and exact places you'll be.  

* **Avoid bad situations.** This is pretty obvious, don't go into bad parts of town unless absolutely necessary, even if it's to take a shortcut. Park your car as close to where you're going as possible, avoiding paying for parking is not worth your safety.  
When on foot, always walk streets that have opposite car circulation to the way you're going, forcing anyone following you by car to either drive around, go in reverse or go against street flow (this has the added bonus of confirming when a car is following you).  
A technique not many people know to avoid being intercepted in a car is to hunt for the green light, minimizing the time your car is stopped, go at the right speed to catch every light as it becomes green when there are not many cars on the road.  

* **Don't trust anyone.** If you're being pulled over by cops, slow down and signal that you're pulling over, but do so in a public place, don't get off your car in isolated areas (most of the time they'll just follow you to where you are comfortable disboarding).  
If you see someone hurt on the road/broken down car/something and want to help. Don't stop your car or think about getting out of your car. Keep driving and call the police. If you jmust, change your route to avoid the accident (I have been ambushed this way, luckily I saw it coming and kept driving at the ""body"" in the middle of the road with the intentions of dricing around it, guy got up and fled as soon as he noticed I wasn't going to stop, I floored the car after that). This really ties into this piece of advise: Don't get off your car or even stop your car unless absolutely necessary.  
When in a party or bar, don't consume drinks you didn't see were opened (ordered a bottle? make sure it is opened in front of you and don't let your sight of it. Someone puring a drink for you? Go with them, get someone else to come with you if necessary if you don't quite trust the person puring it / even if you trust the person). Keep an eye on your belongings, food and drink at all times.  
The above paragraph is a date rapist's worst nightmare.  
If you think or know you're being followed, head to the nearest crowded area, find a business that preferably has security such as a bank. If anything, going into a crowded coffee shop and calling someone is one of your best options. Tell the business workers about your situations and describe the person that is following you, they will call the relevant authorities if you don't have a cell phone.  

* **Be aware.** This really goes without saying, don't be distracted when in public places. Make note of new faces in parties throughout the night. Also, make note of the people you came with and where they are, if one of them is unaccounted for, look for them, they might just be in a bind.   
This last method is the a good way to guard your female friends against would be date rapists. During high school, a friend of my sister's stopped one of his ""friends"" from taking advantage of a female friend by just keeping track of where she was. I never met the guy, but my sister was at the same party, she could have easily been the target and the group was lucky to have someone that aware with them.  

* **Worst comes to worst, cooperate and STAY CALM.** As long as the criminal's first priority is not harming you, cooperate and give the criminal/s what they want. Your wallet or cell phone are not worth your life. Even if the criminal is nervous himself, you can really help the situation by remaining calm. Only speak when being spoken to, make them believe they are in control.   
**Abduction specific advice: do not even try to look into your abductor's faces, you being able to identify them is almost a gurantee that you will be killed once they get what they want. Close your eyes or look away.**  
In case of the threat of rape or bodily harm, yell ""FIRE! FIRE!"". People in general are cowards and can even ignore calls for help in case of rape, but they are pretty much guaranteed come gawk at a fire, this can force a rapist to flee.  
If bodily harm is a high possibility, run. If you cannot run, you must fight back to either take down your assailant or open up a fleeing route, this is where self defense training and self defense devices such as tasers/pepper spray/weapons come in (note how last resort these options are). When considering this scenario, always remember odds are you will lose the fight unless you have REAL defense training with EXTENSIVE application, always aim to flee. Here's the reality check, a violent assailant has the huge advantage of experience, unless you have experience ACTUALLY FENDING FOR YOUR LIFE AND HARMING ANOTHER HUMAN / POSSIBLY KILLING HIM odds are YOU WILL LOSE THIS FIGHT. Making it clear, FLEE, FLEE, FLEE.  Put your ego away.    

I'm saying it again:  
A lot of this advise is extreme and may not apply to your situation to its full extent, but less strict guidelines apply in general.  "	t5_2t3t8	True
1369898903.0	1fbovv	Man at the Rest Stop	Snufaluffaloo	349	43	34	"In the mid 1970s, while my dad was in law school, my family was living in Washington state. While there, my mother's good friend had a very strange encounter. This is her story as she told it to me...



She was having car trouble one rainy afternoon and pulled off into a rest stop to check it out.  Washington is particularly wooded, so many rest stops feel secluded and are often not visible from the highway.  After a few minutes, a man pulled up in a VW Beetle and parked behind her. He was well-dressed and properly-groomed. He was handsome enough, but he gave her the absolute creeps.  He asked if she needed any help and offered her a ride. At this point the rain was pretty intense, and she said that under ordinary circumstances, she may have taken him up on the offer, but the hair on the back of her neck stood up and for no discernible reason, all she wanted to do was get away from him. He continued to pester her for a minute or two, making witty jokes and trying to flirt with her. Just then, another car pulled into the rest area. The man quickly said goodbye and calmly walked back to his car.  He pulled away slowly, smiling at her as he drove past.


About a year later, she recognized a picture of him on the news as a man recently caught and suspected of multiple murders across the West and Northwest US. It was Ted Bundy.



I don't know a lot about him, but from what I understand, it wasn't uncommon for Bundy to lure women into his car in public places. He would generally commit the crimes elsewhere."	t5_2t3t8	True
1352920043.0	1370sy	Got yelled at by a weird girl for holding hands with my boyfriend.	hooks-and-whiskers	367	63	123	"I originally posted about this on my college's subreddit, and someone commented and said that it would be a good story to share with you guys here.

Last night my boyfriend and I were walking through the tunnels below the residence halls, hand in hand.  Ahead of us was a blonde girl with a really strange gait, suggesting some sort of motor issues.  She turned around and looked at us and then screamed and ran around the corner.  We both kinda laughed and said ""What the fuck?"" and kept walking.  When we turned the corner, she was having a conversation in ASL with two other girls.  I don't know ASL, but my boyfriend does, and apparently she was just frantically repeating, ""THEY'RE HOLDING HANDS, THEY CAN'T DO THAT!""  As we approached her, she stopped us and literally KARATE CHOPPED OUR HANDS APART.  In retrospect, we probably should have asked her what the hell she was doing, but we were both too confused to even form coherent sentences.  We tried our best to just ignore it and keep walking around the next corner.  She literally FUCKING CHASED us around the corner, and continued to scream and sign at us and attempted to karate chop our hands apart again.  My first instinct was to punch her, but I figured that it wasn't worth the inevitable lawsuit.  She then ran away, presumably hoping to intercept us when we would reach her (we turned around and went outside instead of continuing on through the tunnels).

Others have commented on my story with similar experiences.  There is also another story where in the middle of the night she was screaming bloody murder in the girl's bathroom of her dorm.  Upon further inspection, she was completely naked and screaming at the mirror.  It sounds like she may be mentally ill, possibly an unmedicated schizophrenic or something.  Hopefully we don't get karate chopped by her again."	t5_2t3t8	True
1343139777.0	x2nrr	My Great Grandmother met a celebrity. 	MEAT_PLOW	367	58	30	"First off, I cannot say without a doubt that this story is 100%, all I know is that my great grandmother is currently 96 years old and has been telling this story for most of her adult life.  She doesn't like getting into the specifics and there is no one living who can verify her story.  My great grandmother grew up in New York City and was born in 1916.  She was the daughter of a Greek and a German immigrant. Like most immigrant families at the time, both her parents were very hardworking and seldom with the family during the day.  My great grandmother says she spent most of her time with her younger sister (now deceased) at a park (she would not say which one).  She said she was between 8 and 10 at the time and her sister was 3 years younger than her.  She said it was not uncommon for young girls her age to be unsupervised in the city at that time.  One day at the park her and her sister met an older looking man in a bowler hat who would ask them question like where they lived or what game they were playing.  He once asked them to asked them if they would like to attend his son's birthday party with him.  My great grandmother simply tried to ignore him when out of the blue he grabbed her by the arm.  She screamed and the man seemed surprised and due to the public nature of the setting he let go an walked away like nothing had happened.  When my great grandmother went to her parents they went to the police with a description of the man.  A year or two later the police got back to my family saying they had an ID on the man who grabbed my great grandmother.  It was Albert Fish one of Americas most notorious serial killers who at the time believed God wanted him to molest, kill and cannibalize children.  Once in custody Fish boasted that he ""had children in every state"".  I have been able to find no evidence besides my great grandmother's story to confirm these events so they might not even be entirely true but regardless, I find this story to be very chilling.  
TL;DR: My great grandmother lived in New York in the 1920s and 30s and claimed she was almost abducted by Albert Fish."	t5_2t3t8	True
1367086215.0	1d866p	In the closet, in the crawl space.	shezbot	355	51	48	"Part of my previous job requirements involved doing bi-weekly inspections on HUD properties (Vacant, government owned homes that we were contracted to list for sale). A lot of these properties were in pretty unsafe neighborhoods. One in particular remains my least favorite house (out of over 300) to this day.

To start with, on my first visit, it was apparent that something had happened in this house. Someone had been making meth or something had gone horribly wrong. A fire had occurred but there was no record of a fire with the previous insurance company, the neighbors said no fire had occurred and the local fire department or police had never responded to a fire.

[Some photos of said property](http://imgur.com/a/MRJ8Y)

I had my fair share of problems with broken windows, used condoms, the usual stuff you find in a neighborhood like this. Then, one afternoon, I pulled up in front of the house and started my inspection as I usually did, by walking around the house and going into the garage. 

Immediately, a car down the street started honking their horn. I thought it was weird but this isn't the best neighborhood so I just ignored it. This house had a garage that was built onto the back of the house, covering 2 bedroom windows (the windows looked down into the garage). There was no door from the garage into the hosue.  In order to enter the garage, you had to go in through a single door on the left hand side of the property, towards the back. I should also mention that the heating system of this house is such that all of the heat comes up from the middle of the house, through a big open vent covered with a screen. The duct work is gone so when you look through the vent, you can see into the crawl space.

I go in the garage and I notice that the crawl space door is open. I look up and notice that one of the bedroom windows is open. I stop. They should both be closed. 

I stand there for what feels like FOREVER and contemplate calling the police but I'm in a hurry so I just turn around, go back out the door and lock it. I go into the front of the house. The car down the street is still honking it's horn.

I start my inspection as I usually do: kitchen, living room, bathroom, bedroom #3, bedroom #1 and then I go to open the hallway closet in between bedroom #1 and bedroom #2. It won't open. I know I've opened it before. I'm turning the knob and pulling it and it will not open. I start to get a really weird feeling in my stomach. The car outside is still honking. 

I step over the vent in the floor to go to bedroom #2 and I look down to see a pair of eyes looking back up at me. I look up, wipe my face, look back down and they are gone. I ran. Straight out the front door, into my car and locked my doors. The car stopped honking. 

This is what I think happened. When I got to the house, there were 2 people inside. The person honking the car horn warned them when I got out of my car. One of them had time to jump out of the window and into the garage and then went into the crawl space. The other one only had time to get in the closet. When I ran out of the house and the horn stopped, they were signaling that I was leaving.

I returned to the property 2 weeks later to find the windows shut, the crawl space door locked but a broken window. I did not enter the house, but called the police instead. They found the closet door shut again and 4 officers were unable to open the door. Upon my return 2 weeks after that, the door opened with ease. I'm convinced someone was in the house with me on many of my visits, I just didn't know it.

1374366321.0	1iq2q8	Sometimes to stop a Creeper, one must become a creeper!	Danzo-Is-The-Best	353	50	41	"Hey r/LetsNotMeet, this is our first and probably only encounter, unless I have just majorly jinxed myself in which case here's to the start of a beautiful relationship. For now, let me tell you a story, a story in which I became a creeper, to stop one. Cryptic? Well let me indulge you.

I usually work late shifts, only until eleven so it's not so bad, however this Monday night I decided to have a few drinks after work with some co-workers. Now, two in the morning I decide to walk home my journey to and from work is about twenty five minutes or so, mostly downhill on the way back. 

So I'm walking in the beauty of the night, just me, silence and the moonlight. Halfway through my journey a shady looking guy comes from the local park, he's a good twenty feet in front of me so I continue the joys of my stroll home. Nearing the bottom of the hill a girl walks past the shady dude....The shady dude stops, leans on a wall and remains there. I keep walking, walk past the girl, a pretty one at that, probably about my age, Hell if I wasn't in a happily committed relationship and not so concerned about freaking her out I'd have made a move of some kind. We both continue or journey going opposing routes.

I walk past the stationary shady guy, a few paces later I turn behind me. 

The shady guy is now trailing the girl, I stop for a second to think this through, despite me instantly labeling the shady guy as shady I didn't really want to judge him as a creeper. However his pace had increased and it was as if he had purpose to his walk. 

""Oh fuck it"" I thought to myself, I began shadowing the creeper. Thankfully he was unaware of me, understandable really given that he was fucking power walking now. The jury in my head had already reached a verdict, this guy was up for some serious shit. I think the girl was now aware that the two people she just passed were now on her tail. I had to do something as well because we were getting to the most secluded part of the walk, if there was a time to make a move on a defenceless person that would be it. 

The problem is, I had no clue how to go about this, I could run to her, and warn her. That however would mean running past the creeper, and creeping her the hell out in the process, I could distract the creeper....Which would probably result in my grizzly death (So much for not judging). I eventually, went for the classic 'Fuck it' tactic.


""HEY SWEET HEART! FANCY A GOOD TIME???!!"" 

My logic was, if I could provoke her from a distance, it'd both catch her attention, and ward off Mr.Shady pants. 

The shady guy jumped out of his skin and looked around, at this point I prepared myself for a fight, there was no need, he veered off in a totally different direction....The girl on the other hand started running, running for her fucking life by the seems of it.

So there I was, standing close to the secluded part of my walk, feeling like a creeper myself. The majority of myself is thrilled that I prevented something terrible from happening.

The other part though feels terrible for scaring her, I to this day kind of wish I came across her again, just so I could explain the situation.


Still, interesting walk to say the least.

Much Love!

1372544750.0	1hc0ad	The Pervert Next Door	darthpickles	354	47	39	"I've been meaning to post this story for awhile, but just now got around to it. For the sake of imagery, I'm female, and when this took place I was thirteen/fourteen years old. 

My family moved to a semi-posh, small housing development when I was in eighth grade. At the time, there were maybe twelve other homes in the development. Soon after moving in, my parents made friends with our next door neighbors, James and Margaret. They were only slightly younger than my parents (I'd guess mid-thirties) and had no children. When asked why they hadn't had any children yet, James said something along the lines of ""I'm waiting to get my ducks in a row."" 

They were super nice, friendly, and fun to be around. Sometimes my parents would leave my little sister and me with them while they would go out. They had a huge house and tons of movies to watch, and cable (which we did not have). At first, I really enjoyed hanging out with James. I thought he was funny and really easy to talk to. He spoke to me like he would to an adult, like we were friends. I could talk to him about school or vent about how strict my parents were. 

For months things were totally normal. Then, very slowly, things started to change. I started to gradually feel more and more uncomfortable around James. He would say little things that I felt were slightly suggestive, and sometimes he would hug me for too long. At first, I just ignored it, and assumed I was probably being paranoid. We continued to be friends with James and Margaret. We'd have dinner with them. Sometimes Margaret would invite me over to bake with her. 

One night, James gave me a fake earring and said it would be really funny if I put it on my belly button to scare my mom. I actually agreed, I thought it would be hilarious. (My mom is really, REALLY conservative.) I went to put it on my bellybutton, and he said ""it would be even funnier if you put it on your nipple instead, do you think it would fit?"" and he tried to lift my shirt up. That was when I knew I wasn't paranoid, and that this man was not my friend. 

Clearly, I should have immediately told my parents, but teenage me was not that smart. I was really embarrassed by the situation, and for some reason felt like I'd just make everyone mad at me if I said anything. So, from that point on, I just made up any excuse to not be around James. If he and Margaret came to our house, I'd stay in my room the whole time. If my family went to their house, I'd say I had homework or just wanted to stay home by myself. My parents just figured I was being a typical anti-social teenager. 

For awhile, nothing happened, then James started calling my house every time my parents went out and I was at home. He'd ask for my dad or mom, but then would try to casually strike up a conversation with me. I'd just brush him off and tell him I'd let my parents know he called. One night I was home alone and he called. He said he was bored, and asked if I wanted to come over and watch a movie. I said I had homework. Another night, he called and asked if he could swing by and pick up some movies that he had let my parents borrow. I felt like I didn't have a valid excuse for why he couldn't take back his own movies so I said ok. He said he'd come get them in a few minutes. I very quickly grabbed the movies, put them on my front porch, then went back inside and locked the doors. He rang the bell but I ignored him. He must have said something to my mom about it because she asked me why I didn't just give them to him, why didn't I answer the door? I told her my music must have been too loud and I didn't hear it. I came up with excuse after excuse and still said nothing, all the while growing to truly hate James.

One night, while home alone, I was cleaning my room. My bedroom is on the side of the house that faces James and Margaret's house, on the second floor. I was just listening to some music, and cleaning near the window. I glanced up and there was James, standing in front of his kitchen sliding glass door, staring up at me. He was fully naked and masturbating. At the time, young and uninformed me didn't actually even know what masturbating was. All I knew was that James was definitely naked, and definitely watching me, and definitely grabbing his own wiener. I quickly slammed down the shade and turned off my light. I was so upset that I hid in my closet. 

A few nights later, my best friend was spending the night. I had told her about what had happened and she actually kinda laughed in disbelief. She said I must have imagined it, no way was he just standing there naked. She believed me later that night when we were hanging out in my room and she suddenly darted into my closet and screamed ""HE'S THERE! AND HE IS IN HIS BIRTHDAY SUIT!"" From that point on, I actually kept that shade duct taped shut so no one would make the mistake of leaving it up. 

That was the last thing that ever happened. I still didn't say anything, because I was so embarrassed and afraid. After that, he and Margaret even started being distant from my parents. We didn't get invited over anymore, they didn't call. My parents would occasionally talk and wonder what happened. They couldn't understand why James and Margaret would just stop being friends with them. Still, I said nothing. Looking back, I think James probably panicked when he realized that both me AND my friend had seen him, that it would be two people's word against his. 

Over the years, James and Margaret's coldness eventually turned into hostility. They would complain and argue with my parents over trivial neighbor stuff. (We didn't mow our lawn often enough, our trees were slightly over the property line, our cats were coming into their yard, etc.) One night over dinner my mom was venting about it and said ""I don't understand what happened! They were our friends, and now they basically hate us! What could we have possibly done to offend them so badly?"" I couldn't take it anymore. I just blurted it out. ""James was a pervert and was harassing me."" I told them every single things that happened, and it all just fell into place and they understood and totally believed me. Obviously, they were livid and my dad wanted to march over to their house immediately and confront James. However, over five years had passed. I was an adult at this point, and aside from not wanting to have anything to do with him, I had no proof. 

James and Margaret still live next door to my parents. Sometimes, when I go their house to visit, he's outside working on his lawn. I never wave or smile as I drive by, but sometimes I lock eyes with him. Although he never had to deal with any consequences, I still feel like I won in the end. I came out totally unscathed, but he's still a pervert, and he has to live with that. "	t5_2t3t8	True

I was about 19 and fairly naive. I'd been in an abusive relationship for a number of years and had terrible self-esteem. That being said, I enjoyed our customers. They were usually really chill and had some pretty great stories. I closed the shop most nights and always worked alone since we were just a tiny business with five employees total. A guy came in about ten minutes until close looking for a new pipe, and I helped him out as ya do. He paid, thanked me, but didn't leave.                                                              I was trying to get my shit done so I could leave, but of course I couldn't count the drawer or anything until he was out of there. He was just standing in the corner, near the door, staring at me. This went on for a couple of minutes before I asked him if I could do anything else for him. His response really creeped me out.

I was nopeing so hard. I told him he had to get out before I called the cops. He pulled out a tiny pocketknife and laid it on the counter, begging me to at least prick the skin on his arm. My boss installed a silent alarm underneath the counter the last time the shop was robbed and I was pressing that thing like my life depended on it (it probably did, actually.) The guy was becoming more and more agitated, yelling at me that I was a bitch, just like all the other girls, we were all whores who'd fuck anyone who wasn't him, and that if I knew what was good for me, I'd cut him. It was the most terrifying experience of my life.

1367681477.0	1dojby	"""Grocery stores aren't all that friendly"""	datpinecone	345	45	60	"This is one my scariest and most vivid childhood memories.
 I was about 5 or 6 years old and I was shopping at a grocery store (Well-Spring) with my mom. Anyways, while looking at some food in an aisle, an old man of about 60 or 70 came to talk to us. My mom was nice about it because what could he want? He then looked at me and then asked me questions like how old and about school and what I liked. I remember immediately not liking him. I answered very quietly, almost whisper. The guy then started to say I am so cute that he could kiss me and then tried to. He leaned down but I got closer to the ground as his lips were getting closer. This was in front of my mother. My mom just laughed and said she is shy so he stopped. Then he laughed and said goodbye. 
My mom told me to never let anyone do that unless I knew them extremely well to kiss me. After a few minutes we were about eat and said to go get some forks and knifes while she gets a seat. 
So I did and there was the man. He followed us around waiting for me to be alone. Then he grabbed me, I started throwing a full blown tantrum. My mom couldn't see because of a wall. He said to people that I ran away and he was my grandfather, so people just looked away. He was dragging me at this point and I had a fork in my hand so what do I do? I stabbed him in the arm. He yelled but didn't let go. 
At this point we are a few feet from the exit. If he got me out of the door, I was a goner, and I knew it (my parents ad school has explained to us what could happen if you get kidnapped). I kicked and scream. We got into an opening where my mom was able to see. Then my mother saw me from afar being dragged. She sprinted, yelling and screaming. The man let go me and ran, with the fork still in his arm. 
My mom hugged me and never let go of me again until we got home and then she cuddled me for hours. She was crying and saying how much she loved me. Then, she told me she was proud of me that I stabbed him and screamed and fought back. If it hadn't been for the screaming she wouldn't have noticed. 
Years later I asked her what happened after that. She said Well-spring called the police and they found him and I that I was completely in the right to stab him, but then she told me nothing else.
Sometimes I dream about this and what would could have happened. It scares me...but I haven't had a big problem like that since then. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1352002716.0	12lkh7	Got harassed by a guy in the middle of the night, spent the morning hiding in my wardobe	mercyowl	363	61	35	I'd been to see Primal Scream in Brixton, and took like 4 night buses back after. It was like 5am by the time I got near to home (we'd got into the after party so one of the best nights of my life at the same time as being one of the scariest) and I had to make the last leg of the journey by myself. I was coming down off some pills I'd taken earlier in the night so I was already feeling pretty shit when a guy sauntered up to me and started a conversation. I didn't engage him but he was a pretty big guy, and I didn't want to be rude, so I was just a little cold, and responded with yes/no answers where I could. There was no one else around (what with it being 5am), and my bus wasn't due for like half an hour, so there wasn't that much I could do. After a couple of minutes he started getting real close and touching my leg. I moved away a little bit and he out of the blue told me he was on parole, and asked if I knew why. I just said no, and tried to change the conversation but he brought it back up and told be he'd been arrested for hurting women and that he'd been released on parole. I was sitting down at this point and he was standing in front of me, and moved so close that his knees up against mine. I was freaking out more than a little at this point, when he put his arms on the sides of my head and leant towards me. This was the point when I literally freaked out, there was no one around and I didn't stand much chance against such a huge guy. I pushed my hands out so that his elbows buckled and as he lost his balance a little I knee'd him as hard as i could in his groin. I pushed him and he stumbled back, and I ran as fast as I possibly could in the direction of my house. It's not that far, like a 25/30 minute walk but I generally don't walk around at night because it isn't the nicest area. I'm not exactly the epitome of fitness but I ran so fast my whole body was burning by the time I got home. I ran straight into my room and spent the rest of the night crouched in the bottom of my wardrobe. It took me a good few hours to get to sleep because all I could think about was would could've happened. That's the scariest situation I've ever been in, and nothing even happened.	t5_2t3t8	True
1363017445.0	1a35bi	Why you should always trust a dog's opinion.	Missharlett	357	60	28	"This happened about a year and a half ago just a couple of months before my dog passed away. 

Me and Maggie had an incredible bond with each other, my family got her when I was little kid and she instantly became my dog. She was a purebred Doberman, but don't let the breed fool you, she absolutely loved people and would walk up to anyone to get petted. She was a sucker for attention, but for the most part was incredibly laid back.
   Once she reached the age of 10 she started slowing down a lot, are usually walks became rare maybe twice a week maybe once every two weeks. She honestly couldn't do them anymore. However one day she seemed perky enough to go out. I decided we would do half of our usual walk which consisted of walking down a mostly empty road(meaning no houses) along the prison. We started down the neighborhood and got to the road. Just a bit down the road there is an old junkyard which I honestly didn't think even was open anymore.
However that day as we were walking an older man walked out from the woods next to the junkyard and started talking to me.
   
   I was on one side of the road, he on the other, and he immediately started asking questions about my dog. Boy or girl? How old is she? How does she get around? Does she have arthritis? Is she friendly? Me being always eager to talk about her started answering all the questions even though I was a bit weary about the guy. I just kind of blew it off as Dobermans attract men being viewed as a manly dog and he probably just admired her. 
     As he started to talk to me he slowly started moving closer to me. Maggie stared him down the entire time and never took her eyes off him, about the time he started moving towards me is when I noticed Maggie's reaction to him and the guy started noticing it as well. 
Kept moving closer and looks at me and says ""So you said she has arthritis right?"" To which I responded ""yea but it only acts up on cold days in winter."" He then tried to pet her and she absolutely exploded. Mind you this dog could barely walk and here she was trying with all her might to attack him. Barking at the top of lungs, lunging to the point where I had to grab her collar and hold her back. And the just smiles at me. 
   It was then he changed his tune and started to show his colors. He asked me if I had a man to which I said yes, he kept pushing and asked if I was married. I again said yes because well I'm not interested so who cares if I am or not? He started telling me how lucky my man was and how I was so sexy. To which I just started blowing him off and walking away. He kept trying to talk to me and at that point I didn't care anymore I wanted to be away from him. 

Unfortunately for me I went away from my house and the only way to get back was to turn around or walk around the entire prison which takes about 40 min and Maggie just wasn't up for it. We started back towards the house and the guy was just standing on the side of the road watching me. He starts trying to talk to me again and at this point I was like yea yea whatever and started walking to my house slowly, I was afraid he might follow me.

A couple of weeks passed and while that shook me up I blew it off thinking it was done and over with. That was until I saw the guy again one day. I was standing in the front of my house and saw a person driving their truck slowly through the alleyway. He made eye contact with me and didn't break it until he was past the fence where he couldn't see me anymore.
   Then later that week around midnight Maggie was acting up like she wanted to go out, being an old woman she sometimes woke us up 1-2 times in the middle of the night to go out, my mom opened the door to the backyard and stood there thinking they'd run into the yard for them but instead they took off onto the pool deck chasing what looked like a full grown man that was standing there. They chased him through the entire yard, he jumped the fence and was gone. 
    Not even a week later my sister walked into my room one night and sees a man trying to climb through my window, which my room faces the backyard and right outside my room is the pool, She looks at him and was like ""what are you doing?"" because my sister is crazy and not afraid when she should be. The man freaked out, got out the window, and ran. 
   We called the cops and they started patrolling our house several times a night. We haven't seen a man in our backyard and I haven't seen that particular man since then. Maggie passed away last January. She was an amazing dog and I still miss her everyday. I'm particularly thankful for the end as in my almost 11 yrs of owning her I've never seen her act like that. It goes to show you should always trust your dog. They know what they are talking about."	t5_2t3t8	True

I'm a girl living on my own in a pretty good neighborhood.
Dude maybe in his mid-late twenties, maybe early 30's also lives in my neighborhood. Probably not ""all there"", but he's nice enough. 
Since, ya' know, spring, and weather be warming up some, he takes walks past my house and I'll be out on my porch sometimes, just petting my cat and reading a magazine, or drinking something awesome, something like that.

He's struck up some conversation before, and I be nice, 'cause that's what I enjoy doing: being nice. He's awkward, but not particularly creepy at all. Not all ""all there"", probably, like I said. Probably a little slow. If he hovers for too long, I'll usually have to find some excuse to go back inside to stop talking to him [""Oh! I left some noodles on the stove. Later!""], then just go back inside and he'll continue on his merry way.

Anyhow. This goes on for about 2 weeks. I think nothing of it. Until last week.

I'm all razzed out, I got done from workin' a long day, and I'm ready for bed. My bedroom is actually the back room of my house, which has a sliding door that leads to my little back deck. I change, fool around with my Nintendo DS some, and turn out the lights.

I'm playing me some Pokemon, when I hear clicking coming from my sliding door.
I thought it was my cat, who paws at the doors when he wants to come in, so I just ignore him. I don't feel like moving.

It continues. All the while, something slowly dawning in my mind: *That's not my cat*. *Someone* or *something* is trying to open the door. [I lock all my doors before I go to bed]
Horror story-scenario mode ensue in my brain.
Not wanted to face something unarmed, I grab me a large kitchen knife. I keep thinking that I'm probably over-reacting.

Turn on the back deck light. Pull the curtain open.

That dude is at my back door, trying to open it, his junk is totally out of his pants.
He gives me a bewildered look while I screech like a pterodactyl. Adrenaline rush.

Fuck. This. Shit.

I grab my cell and call the police as he turns and runs.
I give them a description and a rough estimate of where I believe he lives. They get him and take him in.
I'm still paranoid and pissed as hell.
Didn't sleep that night because fuck everything.

Seriously.

Sorry for the strange formatting, but, seriously, people wonder why I hesitate to be friendly with strangers. This is a good reason why!!

**tl;rd:** Some slow-er guy I'm nice to shows up on my back porch with his junk out and tried to enter my house.

My friend who lived next door, Stacy, and I spent most of our time playing in our front yards. There was a little girl that lived across the street, she was 3 years old. I can't remember her name. 

Anyway, one day, Stacy and I were in our front yard and the girl across the street was out with her mom playing with a little bike. Her mom heard the phone ring inside and rushed in with hardly a glance back at her child alone in the yard.

Seconds later a big truck pulled up. The driver scooted halfway across the seat and opened the passenger door, (closest to the little girl) he was talking to her and waving something. She was walking to the car like everything was fine. 

Stacy looked at me and just shook her head. I told her I was going over there and she grabbed me. I screamed. The man looked over and saw us, looked scared, slammed the passenger door, and raced off.

Stacy told me she stopped me because she was worried I would get hurt. I was pretty mad at her but we went over to ask the little girl what the man was doing. She said that he told her if she got in the car he would give her all the toys she ever wanted. That they were at his house and he would take her there. 

All of this happened in less than 5 minutes, including me crossing the street and talking to her. The careless mom didn't believe me, my mom did and went over to talk to her. I think she threatened to do something. The mom never left her kid out alone after that.

1348499746.0	10e8i2	Give Me Children	cheeseysandwiches	357	63	51	"Well, I have been looking for the right place to put this story; it seems that people listen here. Nosleep would just tell me how not scary it was and that my story was bad. But this is real life, and it was terrifying; to me. You may notice that this is a throwaway account, but I have friends that know my reddit name, and the parties involved wanted to keep this story an anonymous as possible. But after finding this subreddit, I knew this was the place.

Okay, well, it happened about 2 and a half years ago, I was nineteen at the time, and I was kicked out of my house. I was living with a friend [Bethany] who lived in a more secluded town. I immediately feel in love with this family. Other than Bethany, I became very attached to her 13 year old sister, Lani. I never had a little sister, so this was my small chance to have one.

Well, Bethany, Lani and myself went to the mall one weekend, just to blow off some steam. We had our fun, but it was time to go. Before we left we stopped in one more store. This store had some off beat things, piercings, shirts that had funny sayings about sex, and in the back was a sex toy area. Lani happened to be looking at some wallets that was very near the sex toy area. Bethany and myself were looking at the jewelry. We were not too far from her and she was old enough to take care of herself in a store, but I still kept an eye on her. 

I am glad I did because some guy came up to Lani holding something quite mature. Bethany, who is much more soft spoken than I am, asked me to go over to Lani. I was already on my way over. 

""Yeah, this thing right here is a lot of fun, you can come play with my sister.""

That is all I heard him say before snatching Lani away. The guy was about my age, kind of lanky, and he looked all sorts of greasy. I glared at him for a few moments before telling him to go eat a bag of dicks. He started calling me some nasty names, but I did not care. So we left.

We had parked in a secluded parking lot. There were about three cars sitting in the lot; Bethany's, a blue car, and a white van that was about two spots away from Bethany's car. This van was your stereotypical pedo van, and we all saw it, so we started making jokes about it. Lani saw that it had a GMC logo on it. She started laughing and shouted. ""It stands for GIVE. ME. CHILDREN. So obvious.""

And if it were on cue, we heard a light rustle from inside the van. We all stopped and looked at each other, we all heard it. 
""Maybe we are just hearing things."" Bethany looked worried.

Suddenly we heard muffled screams from inside. 

I am a very maternal person, so immediately took charge. I took out my phone, no service[it was a really shit service.] and I know Bethany did not take her phone anywhere and Lani did not have one. I told Bethany and Lani to get in her car and lock the doors. If anyone came out to the van, drive away, but in the mean time memorize or write down the make and the license plate. 

I dashed inside, and started making the biggest ruckus around. I did not know where the mall police were, this was not my mall. In retrospect, I could have just asked someone to call the police, or mall police or whatever, but I was not thinking clearly, I just started yelling and screaming, knocking things over. It did not take long for some mall police to come over, and I immediately told them about the van and the muffled screams. They called the real police, and thus started a long day. They brought Bethany and Lani in, and we stayed inside. We watched from parking lot security screens as they pulled out a bound girl from the van. She looked about Lani's age. Then two cops sat in Bethany's car and waited. Eventually, the creep from our last store walked up to the van. The police went out and made the arrest.

I guess the girl was his younger sister, and things were settled outside of court. I did not see anything about it in the papers. I am guessing the family wanted to keep it private. Bethany, Lani and myself were pretty shaken up over it all, but we were given some free ice cream and that was neat. I guess what I learned from this was, A. creeps can be a wide variety of ages, and B. Sometimes the ""creeper"" van is an actual creeper van.

TL;DR: Some guy that creeped on my friend's sister ended up having his younger sister bound and gagged in the back of his stereotypical pedo van."	t5_2t3t8	True
1375161404.0	1jbwzi	Pedophile tries to break into my friend's house, I catch him in the act	sacaco	342	51	28	"This is my favorite subreddit, and I finally decided to submit my own experience. This happened several years ago when I was 16/17. For the record, I am female and so is my friend. 

I was sitting at home one night around 9pm when my best friend calls to tell me she is home alone and is really creeped out by some noises she is hearing. She also thinks she has seen a figure walking around outside. This was very unlike her. I agree to make the 10 minute drive to come keep her company. She lives out in the country, and her backyard area is basically a forest. On my way, she calls to say she just saw a man looking directly in her window. I haul ass. 

Her garage is attached to the house and has large windows facing the driveway. It is always open and has a (usually unlocked) door into the rest of the house. As I'm pulling in, my headlights shine into the garage, and I see a man walking around in it. I am totally calm because I assume it's her dad or brother who's gotten home. I get out of my car and stroll up to her front door, calm as an idiot cucumber. Before I can get there, she comes running out of the bushes with a fucking knife. I (still calmly, for unknown reasons) ask, ""hey, is your dad home or something?"" She immediately flips the fuck out and demands why. 
Me: ""...I saw a man in your garage"" (aaand now it all clicks) ""WAS THE GUY????""
Her: ""Right as you were pulling up, I heard someone trying to open the garage door, so I ran outside! Your headlights must've scared him off!""

We get in my car, and I call 911. She calls her parents who rush home. Her parents get home right as the cops get there, and suddenly her old-ass neighbor emerges from the bushes, shotgun out. Apparently, her parents called him right after she called, and he was waiting to shoot the fucker dead. The police searched the house but didn't find anyone. 

Fortunately, this has a happy ending. A few days after this, they find the guy who did it. It was some weirdo who actually lives in a house directly through the woods behind her house (which is nearly a mile away). He has a long history of pedophilia and various petty crimes. At the time this happened, he was on parole, which doubly-fucked him. He had apparently creeped on quite a few neighbors who knew who he was and just thought he was weird. I just wonder what he would have done, knowing my friend was home alone. Very glad my headlights scared him away.

1340701460.0	vme3q	Accidental Badass	TheOriginalGalatea	328	35	41	"*I should probably let you know, straightaway, that I have always suffered from a major anxiety disorder. This may explain why I behaved the way that I did. If that isn't excuse enough, chalk it up to the fact that I was young, stupid, and it was my first day as a resident of a big city.*

I was twenty-two at the time, and was moving to San Francisco from a relatively small town. My car was packed to the hilt, and I was following my boyfriend, who was driving the U-Haul. Things had gone fairly well, until we were within the city limits of SF. 

We were stopped beneath an overpass at a a traffic light, and there seemed to be quite a few pedestrians milling about. One of them sprayed something on my windscreen, and then proceeded to squeegee it off. He then stuck a grubby hand through my window, which I had forgotten to roll up. My purse was on the other side of the car, and I didn't even have any coins within reach, so I told him that I was sorry, but I couldn't give him any money.

At this point, traffic had begun to move, and I was really nervous about losing track of the U-Haul. I began to roll forward slightly, when the ""window washer"" stuck what appeared to be the tail-end of the squeegee in my face. Annoyed, I batted it away, only to have it moved up against my temple. His other hand was snaking through the window towards the door handle, but the U-Haul was on the move and the driver behind me honked, so I slapped his hand and yelled, *""Dammit, man! I don't have time for this! I have to go!""* while rolling up the window. The black object poked me in the temple again, so I grabbed it and pulled downwards, while pressing on the accelerator. 

It fell into my lap with more weight than I expected, but the light was turning yellow, so I zipped across the intersection, leaving a very angry person hopping about and gesturing furiously behind me. It wasn't until a few minutes after that, that I happened to glance at the object in my lap. I began hyperventilating, and veered sharply toward the shoulder of the highway. *""Oh, crap,""* I thought, *""It's a gun!  What the hell did I just do?""* 

At this point, I was obviously not thinking clearly, and I only remember desperately wanting to get rid of it. So, at the next off-ramp, I tossed it out the window into some tall, dry grass. I know now that I should have taken it straight to the police, but at the time, I was afraid of  pissing off my boyfriend, so I simply pretended that nothing had happened.

Later, I learned that carjackings are not unusual for that side of town, and that my 'bravery' (idiocy?) undoubtedly prevented one from happening to me."	t5_2t3t8	True
1369255370.0	1euwlc	Good thing we didn't open the door; Good thing I didn't open the blinds.		357	68	42	"Hi! This is a two for the price of one post- both occurring in the same house! I'm a girl, for those who care. 

I live in one the safest areas in the entire World. The location of my old house was no exception. I lived in one of those great neighborhoods that everyone wants to live in by the time they are married and have kids and what not.  I felt totally and completely safe. 

There are only two things are creepy that happened to my family, first to my mom, and then to me, when we were living in my old house. That being said, it was the most kickass house/neighborhood ever and creepy ass stalker/people didn't deter from that at all. 

Digressing.

Anyway, 
the first one happened to my mom. My family and I immigrated from Europe when I was just a baby for my dad's job. My parents didn't speak English very well at all when we first moved, so it was pretty hard on them both. 
My dad was working out of town and it was just my mom, my older brother,3, and  me, being a useless 6 month old, home for the weekend alone.  
Apparently, this is where it gets to be like the movie the Strangers, someone rang the doorbell at 3 in the morning, obviously waking my mom up. At first she thought that maybe my dad had come back early from his trip and forgot his keys, which happens way more often then you'd think. 
She goes to the door, ""Hello?"" 
A woman's voice replied, and it was very soft but urgent sounding, ""I need to talk to Stacy."" 
My mom in her broken english tried to tell her that Stacy didn't live here. And apparently the woman kept insisting that she did, but in a voice that was very creepily calm and soft. My mom never opened the door, but the bitch came back two more times that night, ringing the doorbell, asking the same thing over and over again. ""I need to talk to Stacy"". 

Fast-forward 13 years. I'm a sassy thirteen year old, living in the same house. My house had a huge back porch that everyone used to come and hang out on. The porch was wooden and surrounding it was a pretty tall railing, built that way on purpose because my entire family is really tall. Thus, it's very easy for someone to stand on the railing and get onto the shortest part of our roof and shimmy up the the big window on that roof section; read, my window. 

Well one night I was reading like a badass past my bedtime, so maybe 1030, with my dog Hades laying on my bed. Hades was the most loving, wonderful yellow lab that anyone could have. He was so friendly to everyone, and the only time he would ever bark was if someone rang our doorbell or knocked or whatever. 
So I just shut off the lights and stop reading, probably Harry Potter, and I begin to toss and turn. Suddenly, I feel Hades move, and I look and his gaze is directed toward my window. 
Sidenote: That's the thing I hate the most about animals, is when they perk up and stare and you know they heard something you didn't and you're like ""oh my god, i'm going to die""
Anyway, 
then I hear this noise that sounds almost like someone is placing their palms on the window and trying to slide it up. At this point Hades starts to growl, and I peace the fuck out of my room and go to my brother's room; I had really bad night terrors so it wasn't uncommon for me to sleep there because I really liked the comfort of him being there. 

Well, when I woke up the next morning, I decide to open up the blinds and there were smeared handprints all over the outside of my window. "	t5_2t3t8	True

   Anyway, one night it was dead. A group of 4 guys came in and sat at the counter looking for something to carry out. I was just busy cleaning getting ready to close, about half an hour to go. These guys are acting strange, some where looking around while whispering to each other. They where there for about ten minutes, not even paying attention to the menu. Then I noticed there were two guys at the entrance of the restaurant and three more outside by two cars, which where still running. 

   At this point I got a bit nervous. The one dish boy was busy cleaning the kitchen and my manager was in the office doing paper work. So here I am, alone. Not even 5 minutes later two police officers (who were my regulars) came in for dinner. As soon as they got in all of the guys left without a hesitation. 

  When the two officers left they asked if I was okay. I told them I was fine, just a little freaked out by the moment. They told me that those guys were probably going to rob the diner and I'm lucky they came in that night. 

  Ah perfect timing.

1362760301.0	19x2jj	In 1964, My mother and grandmother came upon the dead body of a little girl on a remote road..		362	70	41	"My mother told me this story years ago, my grandmother never mentioned it even until her death. 

In 1964, in the fall, I was an infant. My mother and grandmother and I, (probably not in a carseat, in those days), were on a rural, wooded road in the hills of Northeast Alabama not far from my grandmother's house.  

It was close to dusk on a Sunday evening. My mother was driving, and as she rounded a curve, she saw a figure in the road, a light, pink fabric lifting in the breeze around it. They both realized quickly it was a child. My mother stopped the car. My mother and grandmother got out out, my grandmother holding me, my mother ran to the little girl in the pink dress, white patent shoes. She was clearly dead. My mother looked around, for a house, anything, at first she saw nothing but trees, and growing darkness. 

Then, up the road some yards, the glow of a dim light, back off the road. My mother walked toward it.  Through the trees stood a little church. The glow of the lights inside shining out--Sunday night services. My mother opened the door. The preaching stopped, the eyes turned to her. My mother doesn't really remember what she said, something like, ""There's a little girl, she's hurt, does she belong to anyone here?"" (She knew the child was dead, but didn't really want to yell it in the church)

Several people, including a couple who clearly could be the parents, spilled out of the little church, out on to the road. Mother also saw something now she had not seen before. The car that had hit the little girl. It had run off the road down a small ravine. The occupants were not hurt, but were sick, throwing up, just starting to deal with it. My mother realized she must have driven up seconds after it happened.

The people around the little girl realized she was dead. My mother said the parents never said a word. They picked up the little girl, put her in their car and drove away.

The part of the story that seems so cinematic to me, is the part where mother opens the church doors. My mother was young, beautiful, tall. I imagine it as loud, though it probably wasn't. It would be so dramatic if it were raining and she were wet, but it wasn't, the sudden silence of the congregation, all the heads turning her way. I'm sure it was plenty dramatic without my cinematic embellishment.

The little wooden church has been torn down and rebuilt closer to the road:

1931 Brookside Rd
Mt Olive, AL 35117

You can see it almost 50 years later on street view. Houses now, and less trees.

1375821630.0	1ju3sl	Classmate rescues sister from kidnapper	coldbeeronsunday	322	38	21	"This isn't my own story, it's actually the (very true) story of a guy I went to law school with. His name is Jed. We took a class together in law school that required us to tell a life-changing story from our lives as if it were an opening statement in a courtroom. This is Jed's story.


When Jed was about 10 or 12 years old, his parents adopted his sister as an infant. Jed wasn't really warming up to his new sister very well - he found it hard to accept the situation, since they weren't related by blood, and I think just wondered if he would ever think of her as his ""real sister.""


So one day, Jed accompanied his mom and baby sis to a large Wal-Mart-type store. Jed was walking along the shopping cart, and his baby sister was still in her car seat, which was clipped onto the front of the cart, so the baby was facing outwards towards his mother pushing the cart. His mother stopped the cart in the middle of an aisle to search for a particular brand of deodorant or something and asked for Jed's help in locating the specific product she was looking for. 


No more than a minute later, Jed's mom turns around and starts screaming ""Where's my baby?! Where's my baby?!"" In that short period of time, someone had walked up to the shopping cart, silently unfastened the car seat, abducted Jed's baby sister out of the car seat so that an empty car seat was all that was left, still clipped to the cart. 


Without hesitation, pre-teen Jed sprints to the complete opposite end of the store (thinking that whoever took her would've tried to move as far away from them as possible) and began frantically running up and down every aisle in search of his baby sister. He finally found her laying on her back, unharmed, in the front part of a shopping cart (where you often see little kids strapped in). A woman was standing with her back towards him, looking for something in the aisle. He just grabbed his sister and took off without saying a word. 


I think his mother wound up alerting store security and they went back and looked at the security camera footage and apprehended the woman who stole the baby.


Jed said that was the moment he realized that he truly loved his adopted baby sister. That story totally creeped me out, though, considering how quickly and quietly the kidnapper lifted the baby out of the seat and moved to a completely different area of the store...she must have been following them and watching them the whole time they were in there.

She'd been hearing noises in the roof for a while and assumed it was possums. There's a law here that prevents interfering with possums unless you've got certain qualifications or something, so she tried to ignore it until she could find the money to call the guys to get it out of the roof.
                       
One day she got home from work and found her apartment had been broken into. She called the police immediately and they came straight over. They were examining her living room and talking to her when she mentioned the possums in the roof. She said that as soon as she said this the three officers that were there all started paying very close attention to what she said. They asked how long she'd been hearing these possums and where in the roof, what time of day, etc. She was confused, since she doubted that the possums had ransacked her house and turned the couch upside down, but she answered all their questions. One of the officers asked if he could take a look in the roof. She got him a ladder and showed him where to get up. He disappeared for a few minutes while the other officers waited, looking tense. When he came back down he told her to sit down, as he had some news.
                     
He told her what he'd found in the roof. A bed made of rags and old clothes and some tins of food. He told her that there was a man who had taken to hiding in the roof of females living alone, making a little nest there, then after a few weeks he would emerge at night, rape them and disappear.
          
Needless to say, my friend was shocked and horrified. The police stayed with her while she packed some clothes and called a friend to come and get her. She stayed with a friend, never returning to the house unless absolutely necessary and never alone, until the police contacted her and told her the man had been caught and sentenced. After that she immediately moved into a granny flat out the back of some friends' house.
                  
The police told her that the break in had probably been completely unrelated. It's sort of ironic that someone breaking in to her house saved her from being raped."	t5_2t3t8	True
1343804050.0	xhu17	The Kid Who Shot His Neighbor	Injunwerks	374	92	53	"Growing up in the bottom was sometimes difficult. When the flood came every year, it severely limited my roaming area. Unless the flood was actually in our yard; which was a rare occurrence, most of the kids from the bottom would normally wind up playing football or baseball in our yard. All together; there were probably 8 or 10 kids that would get together; the kids from the bottom and some other neighbors. We’d choose teams and play whatever game was popular at the moment. When we moved away in November of 1984, it was a sad time for me because I was leaving behind the only friends I’d ever known. Some of whom I’d known since kindergarten. 

I was fifteen when we moved away from Kenefick and the bottom. We moved for several reasons; my father got a better job offer in another state, my mother had attended a college for cake decorating and wanted to start her own business in a bigger town, and our trailer house was starting to show its age. I think the most important reason my parents decided to move was that the population of Kenefick and the bottom had grown. The bottom being what it was; it attracted a less than perfect quality of resident. In the last few years that we lived there; the police were coming out more and more often. The bottom seemed to become a refuge for those who weren't on the best of terms with the law enforcement community. 

There were more and more cars and trucks driving faster than was safe at all hours of the night. It was a rare weekend that we didn’t see blue and red lights go whizzing by our house or hear a screaming siren. One night a helicopter landed in the field across from our house and was met by an ambulance a few minutes later. We heard later that someone had broken into a house in the bottom and had been shot. It wasn't that tight-knit little community any more. There were more and more strange cars and faces. 

The summer of 1984 was eventful for me on several levels. I turned 15 in July and got my first razor amongst my other gifts. My voice had finally stopped squeaking. I grew to 5’10” (I’m 6’1” now). I was a cornerback on the high school football team. Dad was teaching me to work on cars by fixing up an old ’73 Cougar for me to have when I got my license. And, I was in love with a girl who lived down the street from us. 

Her name was Heather and she consumed my every thought, wish and desire. We’d known each other since her family moved in about a year after us and we’d ridden the bus to school together for almost 9 years. She was my first crush. My first kiss. My first love. My first heartbreak. My first everything.

Heather was a year younger than me and we went from hating each other in elementary school to tolerating each other in junior high. When I started high school, she was still in junior high so we went to different schools. I can remember the first day I noticed her as something other than that skinny little black haired girl from down the street. It was when school started after the Christmas vacation and she got on the bus and was wearing new glasses.  Weird I know, but those glasses seemed to magnify the prettiest green eyes I’d ever seen. She caught me staring at her as she walked by to sit with her friends and smiled at me. Braces! Wow!

By the time she started high school the next year we were a serious item. Her mother and my mother were good friends and her mother would always say something that would embarrass the crap out of me. “You two will have the cutest kids” or “Oh, I think I hear wedding bells.” Of course she was teasing, but still. Every time we left her house to go for a walk or to do homework or whatever, her dad would give me his sternest look and would say “Be nice.” I knew exactly what he meant and I was always nice; for the most part. 

Heather had diabetes and it always amazed me that she had to get shots every day. Every. Single. Solitary. Day. I was in awe of her bravery and how she just shrugged it off as a part of life. She broke her ankle one summer jumping from a horse that got spooked, so every afternoon I would ride the bus past my house to hers and carry her books in for her and then I’d walk home. Her mom would always invite me to stay for dinner, but I never did. 

About a week after she broke her ankle, we came home from school one day and there was a new trailer house in the lot next to hers. Her mom told us that she’d already met the family and they had a boy my age and another son who was 8 or 9. I met them a few days later when they started riding the school bus. 

Robert was actually a year younger than Heather. He was a tall, gangly, clumsy type of kid who wore thick glasses and was deep into Dungeons and Dragons. He was quiet and kept to himself. We invited him to play football and do other stuff with us, but he was never interested. He read a lot and stayed indoors. Heather had already told me that he watched her whenever she was outside, but whenever she waved; he’d act like he didn’t see. He was an OK guy. We got along and he taught me to play Dungeons and Dragons and another game that I can’t remember now. 

His younger brother was named Jason. Jason was an odd duck. His head was too big for his body and his teeth and ears were too big for his head. He was mouthy too. Anything anyone had ever seen or done, he or someone he knew had seen it or done it better. It got so bad that we would actually make up words about things to see if he would take the bait and he never let us down. He knew all about the Chevrolet Z56 twelve cylinder, six wheeled car that was coming out the following year. He knew all about the new bullets that army was developing that could shoot someone around corners and go through tanks. 

He was also a klepto. Pens, rulers, Hot Wheels, baseball cards, ball caps and anything else that wasn’t guarded was fair game. The bad thing was that whenever anyone called him on it, he’d insist that his aunt or a teacher gave it to him. Robert and even his mother would always validate his story. Jason was always the instigator. He would tell one kid that another was talking about him just to see the reaction. Whenever we played a game, he would always want a do-over if things didn’t go his way and if we refused, he’d say we were cheaters and liars. It didn’t take very long for Jason to become unwelcomed around us. 

One day, Heather caught him behind their well-house bent over something. She asked what he was doing but he didn’t hear so she walked over to see. He’d found a dead bird and was pulling the feathers and skin off it. Heather said that she screamed and asked what he was doing. She said that he never moved and just looked over his shoulder at her with a spooky grin and said he wanted the skull. 

About a month later, Heather’s father caught him inside the well-house putting wrenches into his pockets. He grabbed Jason by the arm and took him to his house to make him admit to his mother that he was stealing. When Jason’s mother opened the door and saw her baby being held by the arm, she went crazy and started yelling at Heather’s father; telling him that she was going to sue him. As Heather was telling me all of this at their kitchen table her dad walked by and said that Jason was a damned creepy little kid. 

One day a week or so later, Robert showed up at my house and asked if I’d seen Jason. He was supposed to be home for dinner and it was almost dark. I hadn’t seen Jason and I relayed this to Robert. My mother heard Robert asking me about this and told him that she’d seen Jason over in the field across the road. She said that he was playing with a dog in the door of the old abandoned barn about an hour earlier. 

Robert and Jason missed school the next two or three days and the next time I saw Robert on the bus, he told me that he’d found Jason in the barn with the dog. Jason had killed the dog and was skinning it. He told me that he had blood all over him like he’d played in it. 

Robert said he ran home, leaving Jason there and told his dad about it. He and his father went back to the barn and Jason was still inside with the dead dog. Robert said his father grabbed Jason and was dragging him out of the barn when he saw all of the skulls. He told me that there were skulls of all different kinds up on a shelf. He didn’t recognize a lot of them, but he did see little bird and mouse skulls. He said there were a lot of bigger skulls there too; probably fifteen or twenty. He said that they were black and brown and still had some skin left on them. Flies were everywhere and it smelled bad. Of course, I went straight to that old barn after school that afternoon, but someone had taken it all away. It did smell horrible in there and someone had spread sawdust all over the dirt floor. 

Robert told me that his father and mother had a huge fight the night they found Jason in the barn. Robert’s father was planning to take Jason to a doctor and his mother kept insisting that he was just a little boy doing normal little boy things. Jason wasn’t on the bus for three or four weeks after that. When he did go back to school he wasn’t the same person. He didn’t speak to anyone or respond when spoken to. Obviously everyone had a million and one questions, but he just ignored them all. He just stared out the window with his mouth opened and never said a word. I realize now that he must have been medicated.

Eventually; the attempts to get his attention turned to ear flicks and swats to the back of his head but there was never a response. Robert made everyone leave him alone. Then one afternoon, it was raining and we were almost home when Jason started hitting himself. At first no one noticed, but then Bobby Burrows turned around in his seat and told Robert that Jason was hitting himself in the face and that he was getting blood all over his clothes. Robert ran up and sat with Jason; holding his wrists so he would stop. That was the last time I saw Jason before I moved two months later. 

When we moved, I called Heather as soon as I knew our new phone number. We’d already said our goodbyes but promised to keep in touch. Heather and I kept in touch through letters and cards mostly. This was before cell phones and the long distance charges cost too much so I was limited to an hour on the weekend. Heather told me most of the important news through letters (this was before email too) whenever she didn’t want to be overheard telling me any gossip that was good and juicy. This is also how I found out that she had gone on a date with someone else; through a letter. sigh… 

Anyways; Heather told me about how Jason was back in school and how he’d get into a fight at least once a week. She said that he was talking now, but only when someone talked to him and then it was only a one word response. He always had a scowl on his face and walked around with his hands clenched into fists. She said that someone visited his house on Tuesdays and Thursdays and stayed for about three hours and then left. Sometimes she could hear Jason screaming at whoever it was. She told me that he was getting weirder by the day; that he was up all hours of the night standing at his window and looking outside for hours. Heather also told me that she thought Jason’s mom was on drugs. Evidently she’d spoken to Heather and called her Stephanie one time and Sandra the next. 

Over the next few years, Heather and I continued to keep in touch. She told me about her prom and even sent pictures. By this time, I’d met my next love and wasn’t so bothered by someone else kissing on Heather. Actually; I was jealous, but I never said so. I graduated high school in 1986 and sent Heather and invitation. She graduated in 1987 and sent me one of hers in return. I still have it somewhere. She also sent a wedding announcement the following year. That one hit me pretty hard. But by then, I was able to be genuinely happy for her. They didn’t get married though and I cried with Heather over the phone when she told me about their breakup. 

I got engaged myself about six months after that and joined the army two months later. We still sent letters and cards several times a year. Occasionally there would be a tidbit about Jason. He stole a bunch of stuff from the cars that were parked by our old house when the flood came one summer. Someone saw him going from car to car and called the police. He broke all the windows out of another neighbors’ house while they were gone for the weekend. He got caught shooting a pellet gun at someone’s horses once. He was also accused of molesting a little girl from the bottom, but nothing ever came of it.  

In December of 1990, my unit went to Saudi Arabia for Desert Storm and Desert Shield. I sent Heather my APO address and told her how my fiancé had dumped me the previous month. She sent back a box of homemade chocolate chip cookies with a note that said not to worry that they weren’t sugar free. She made me promise to be careful and told me that she was afraid for me and to promise to write as often as I could, which I did. 

I got a letter from her in the last part of May of 1991 that she’d sent about three weeks earlier. We were still overseas and had no clue when we’d get to go home again. When I opened the letter, there was also a newspaper clipping. The clipping was from a local newspaper and was a story about a 15 year old youth who shot another neighbor in an attempted robbery and was being charged with murder. The name of the youth was withheld because of his age, but it listed the name of the woman; Valerie. 

At first I thought Heather sent the clipping because we both knew Valerie. She lived two houses down from me; between the house where I lived and Heather’s. She was a nice, bubbly, happy woman. She had a huge Great Dane named Rontoo and she painted. She was one of those people who was never in a bad mood and never had a bad word to say about anyone. She was one of the few genuinely nice people I've ever known. She was one of those people who made the world better just by being in it. My heart stopped for a minute when I realized it was her who’d been shot. I'd harbored a secret crush on Valerie when I lived there. 

After I read the clipping, I read Heather's letter. After she’d told me that she hoped I was OK and would be coming home soon, she relayed what happened. Evidently Jason had met some of the rougher elements who lived in the bottom and started using drugs. He’d been in some more trouble here and there and it got worse after his mother left earlier that year. Robert got married and moved to another town. He visited one night and he and Jason got into a huge fight. 

Heather was able to hear everything because it was a cool night and she'd opened the windows for some fresh air. Her parents were gone somewhere and the air conditioner (a window unit) was too loud. She went on to say that she heard them fighting and crashing into the walls and breaking things. She told me that one of them got pushed into a window and broke it. She said that Jason was screaming so loud that his voice would crack. After about fifteen minutes of this it got quite and then Robert left. 

Heather said that she could hear Jason crying and ranting and screaming to himself. Then she saw him walking in front of her house toward Valerie’s place. Valerie’s husband worked at a grocery store called Brookshire Brothers in Dayton during the day and went to college at night. He was also in the National Guard and was gone one weekend a month and two weeks during the summer. Instead of getting up early on Saturday morning and driving to wherever he went for his National Guard weekends, he would leave on Friday night. Whenever he was gone; Valerie’s niece would stay with her. Jason was in love with her niece. I can't remember her name now and I never knew her when I lived there. 

Heather told me that she didn’t give it much thought because she was trying to concentrate on her books. But then she heard shouting and saw Jason storming back to his house. She just assumed that Valerie didn’t want him at her house; especially if he was high on something. Heather (who was a junior in college at this time) was studying and forgot all about it until she heard shouting again from Valerie’s place about half an hour later. She said that she could hear crying too. She could also hear Jason shouting. She turned off her desk lamp so she could see outside better and when she looked, the front door of Valerie's house was standing open. Heather said that she was just getting ready to call the police when she heard the shot and saw Jason run out the door and head back to his own house. 

Heather said it scared her so bad that she couldn't move. She sat in the dark watching and listening but afraid to draw attention to herself by moving or making any noise. Heather said that he was home for about fifteen minutes and then got into his car and left. When he was out of sight she ran over to Valerie’s house. Mr. Votaw; who lived between Heather and Valerie was already there and was calling the police. Valerie’s niece was sitting on the sofa with her legs pulled up to her chest, hugging her knees. She was hysterical and crying. Mr. Votaw wouldn’t let Heather go into the bedroom. Heather said that he told her in a voice that was much older than it should have been to keep the door closed, that she didn't want to see anything in there. Then he told her to care for the little girl. Then they waited until the authorities arrived. 

Heather went on to tell me that according to the nieces statement, Jason asked if he could sit and talk for a few minutes but Valerie didn’t think it was a good idea. The niece said that his nose and lip were bleeding and the he had cuts or scratches on one arm that were bleeding. Valerie asked him to leave and when he didn’t she got up to call the police and that is when he started shouting and left. 

The girl said that about twenty minutes later something hit the side of the house and Rontoo started barking. When Valerie opened the door to see what happened, a man in a black ski mask forced her back inside with a pistol in her face. He made her lock Rontoo in the bathroom and threatened to shoot him if she didn’t do as he asked. When he talked, the niece recognized his voice and recognized the cuts on his arm. 

After the dog was in the bathroom he made them go into the bedroom and lay face down on the bed. He wanted to know if they had any money and they told him that there was money in their purses. The niece said he was silent for a minute and then she heard the gun shoot and felt the bed jerk. Then she heard Jason run out of the house. The police found Jason a few hours later at a friends’ house where he was arrested. 

Jason was later tried as an adult and sent to prison. I don’t remember the length of the sentence. As far as I know he’s still incarcerated. I remember him being a weird little kid. I can remember talking about him to some of my new friends after I’d moved and telling them that he was the type of kid that would grow up to be a terrorist or lead a cult. I guess I had him pegged from the start. 

Here is a link to a story about the incident from the Houston Chronicle: 

http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/1990_744058/teen-certified-as-an-adult-for-trial-in-slaying.html

I guess you’re wondering about me and Heather. We eventually got married. But not to each other. She married a man she met in her senior year of college and they live in Conroe, Tx with two girls now. I married a woman from Argentina and have been happy ever since. It’s funny sometimes how life works out for the best in spite of some bad times.

Again, I am sorry this is so long. I start typing and the next thing I know, it’s a small book. Please share your thoughts. I’ve still got a few more if you’re interested.

1371262983.0	1gdn8o	It's a porn store, not an asylum...	Cubbance	323	43	27	"When I was 21, I moved into the city and got a job at a porn store.  It was, for the most part, a great job, with a lot of freedom and just a great, laid back vibe.  The major drawback, though, is that I got a lot of creepy people in, and I was almost always alone.  

This particular experience was shortly after I had started the job.  I'd always been a pretty naive guy, and I didn't have much experience, work or otherwise, in the real world.  So starting at a porn store (only my second full-time job at the time) was already a bit of a head-turner.  It was around Christmas, so we were pretty dead at the time, but my boss was there just hanging out (something we all did quite a bit).

At around 9 pm, a guy walks in.  He's rail-thin, with sunken eyes, thick stubble, and wild gray hair.  He was twitchy, and muttering to himself.  With him came the stench of body odor and alcohol.  He had a distinctly crazy air to him, and he instantly made me uncomfortable.  Ed, the manager, was in the back room getting inventory, so I was very much on my own.

The guy wandered around the store for a minute or so, and then came right up to the counter.  I said ""can I help you?""  He just sat there staring at me.  Not smiling, not speaking.  Just staring.  I started to tell him to move on, when he suddenly said ""have you ever seen anyone with a piercing...you know...down there?""  I said ""um, sure, it's pretty common.""  I have no clue why I even entered into this conversation.  It got weirder, very quickly.  He started rambling, talking about piercings, S&amp;M, and sex, but seemed to use only euphemisms and suggestive gestures to refer to genitalia.  Like it was something shameful.  I kept wandering away, to straighten the videotapes (this was in 1996) on the wall, and basically tried to dismiss him.  I was way too meek and non-confrontational at the time.  Every time I moved, he moved to continue rambling at me.  I know now that the way he was speaking was reminiscent of the ""word salad"" that schizophrenics frequently exhibit.

I don't remember everything he said, but the end of the conversation was something like this:

Creep: I like those piercings [referring back to the penis piercings].  I pierced my own thingy with knife, and then filled a cup with the blood.  And then I drank the blood.  Why did I do that? [he sounded almost pleading]

Me: Because you're fucking nuts?!  Jesus christ, man.  This is a porn store, not an asylum, and you need to fucking go!  [This was the incident that broke me of my meek non-confrontational nature]

Creep: But I want to talk to someone about this.

Me [having spotted my manager coming back up to the desk]: Well, Ed knows ALL about that stuff.  Talk to him.  

I pawned the guy on Ed, and I stepped aside.  Ed listened for like 10 seconds and then kicked the guy out, telling me that next time someone freaks me out, to just boot them."	t5_2t3t8	True
1359465465.0	17hsek	Knock knock	regularcappuccino	319	36	52	"I'm renting a studio apartment in the big city while I have an internship. It's in an old building with one other apartment, and we both share a hallway with a locked door to the outside world at the end of it.

When I first got here, I arrived pretty late, so the landlord left a key for me in the letterbox and texted me the combination. The next day, when I came home from work, the key wouldn't work in the lock any more.

I was pretty puzzled, since it had worked perfectly before, so I called a locksmith to see if he could let me in. He told me the lock had failed, and it would have to be replaced completely, including with a new key. It cost me $300 all up, but I was tired and hungry and glad to be back inside, and I thought I could show the receipt to the landlord and be reimbursed.

Being the absent-minded person I am, every time I got home late from work I would see the receipt on the table and think ""That's right, I need to tell the landlord, and give them the new key."" But I never got around to it.

Then, a few weeks ago, I was lying in bed watching TV on a low volume before I fell asleep. I was just starting to doze off when I heard a sound that jerked me awake.

The sound of a key being inserted into my door.

I immediately jerked up in bed and gathered the covers around me, going through the list of people in my head who it might be. Not my parents, they're 5 hours away. Not a friend, none of them know this address. And besides, how would they get into the secure hallway?

Aside from me, the only person with a key was the landlord. And why the fuck would he let himself in unannounced at midnight? While I was sleeping? In the nude?

I sat there frozen, staring at the door in horror and waiting for it to open.

Except it didn't. I changed the locks.

As I sat there paralysed with fear, that fact slowly sank in. I changed the fucking lock when I moved in. They couldn't get in, because the lock screwed up and I was too flaky to tell anyone about it.

I slipped out of bed and pulled on my work clothes, then kind of just stood there in the middle of the room, with my phone in my hand, waiting for them to leave. I was way too scared to breathe too loud or even turn off the TV, in case they realised someone was inside. My door doesn't have a peep hole, but even if it did, I probably would've been too much of a coward to cross my room and stand that close to it. I felt like I was having a mini heart-attack.

The lock was audibly being manipulated at this point. Whoever was on the other side was loudly jiggling the key and shaking the knob, and I heard the door creak as though someone was leaning on it.

I was still ready to crap my pants, but my mind bizarrely wandered to how I would tell my parents about this. I clearly imagined my mum saying 'Well, did you tell them to go away?' and making up an excuse that it was just someone lost, or they got the wrong apartment. It sounds ridiculous, but I needed to prove that I wasn't an irrational person. I needed to prove that this wasn't just some silly mistake I was blowing out of proportion.

So I cleared my throat and let out a feeble: ""Hello?""

The shaking stopped immediately. This was almost worse than the noise from before. Every muscle in my body tensed listening for a sound, and I quickly decided to turn off my TV, since they already knew I was here. Then it was just me, the silence, and my mind working in overtime to try to explain who the hell this person was.

Until they knocked on the door. 
I stood dead still in the middle of the room, but my stomach gave an involuntary jolt at the sound.

He knocked again. 
A muffled voice came through the door, and it creaked again, like someone was leaning on it. 

""Hey, let me in.""

This might be the part of the horror movie where the dumb girl opens the door, just to satisfy her curiosity. But every cell in my body simultaneously screamed ""Oh, hell naw"". I decided I would continue with my currently plan: to stand tense and frozen in the middle of the room. Except I backed towards the kitchenette and grabbed the biggest knife I could find.

In the absence of my response, knock became a loud bang. First it sounded like someone was insistently pounding their closed fists on the door, but soon the whole door frame and wall shook from the impact. I realised the person was throwing their body weight against it.

At this point, I called the police.

I can't even remember what I said to them, I was so filled with white-hot panic. I was later told I screamed 'HURRY, SEND EVERYONE', which is a bit embarrassing. I had trouble remembering my address, but luckily it was still on the locksmith receipt still sitting on the table. (I owe that fucking guy a beer).

When I was talking to the operator, she said she could hear the guy trying to get in, and I should lock myself in the bathroom if I could. I guess he overheard me on the phone, because the banging abruptly stopped. Suddenly I was in the Jaws situation again, where the shark is gone but you know it's just under the water. I held onto the knife so tightly that my nails made a mark in the palm of my hand where they wrapped around it, and I kept asking the operator: ""What if he comes back?""

Luckily I didn't have to worry about that. The next people to knock on my door were the cops. They were able to get into the hallway because someone left the shared access door wide open. Of course the perpetrator was long gone.

I still don't know who knocked on my door that night, and I'm not sure I want to know. My New Year's Resolution was to stop putting things off, but now I know that good things come to those who wait (to talk about their new key).


tl;dr: Changed my locks, didn't end up knockin' on heaven's door."	t5_2t3t8	True
1376402861.0	1ka0q4	Garage sale creeper	petty_propriety	356	72	47	"Summer after fifth grade, around the end of June, I went garage saling with my mom and grandma in the neighboring town. Had a lot of good buys. 

The last place we hit up was a housing addition the edge of town, where a lot of old people and empty-nesters lived. It was kind of boring, but I thought I would poke around just in case. My mom and gran let me go ahead of them while they browsed, so I went up to the next house. 

It looked pretty normal. I mean, it looked the same as every other house in the addition. Maybe not as many frills, but nothing out of place really. There wasn't a sign in the yard but the garage door was open and there were tables out. A guy was sitting in a lawn chair at the back of garage. So, legit, I suppose. I went in.

There wasn't a lot of selection. And old coffee maker, throw pillows. There was a rack of plus-size womens' clothing and shoes. No men's clothes or shoes. Anything that suggested a man lived there. 

The man at the back of the garage sat there smiling the whole time. He was maybe in his late 30s/early 40s, moustache, bald at the top and had a fringe of brown hair that tapered down his neck. He wore a wolf t-shirt and denim cut-offs. He kept crossing and un-crossing his very hairy legs, like with rhythm, and kind of swinging them.  

Beneath another table was a huge box of naked Barbies priced .50 cents a piece. I bent down to inspect them. First of all, the Barbies' hair was sticky and crusty. Like someone put glue in them. Second of all, they smelt *terrible*. Like rotten or something, body odor, just inconceivably *foul*. I was pulling away when the man in the back of the garage started asking me questions, like how old was I, where did I go to school. He asked me if I liked the Barbies.

Not really interested, I said.

He started talking about his cockerspaniel named Spiffy or something and then let the dog out when it started scratching on the garage door. It started growling at him, like snarling, and it ran around to the back of the house. By then I decided I was done here. He hadn't *really* done anything, but he gave me the creeps. 

Leaving already? He sounded disappointed.

I told him to have a nice day. 

Ran off to my mom and gran, but I didn't tell my mom about the creeper. I just told her he had a crap selection. Nothing she would like anyway.

A week or so later we saw on the news a man broke into a woman's house, tried on all her clothes, molested her daughter. . .and hosted a garage sale at their house, at that housing addition. 

Clarification (sort of): Okay, so I guess I left out some details... sorry, guys. The intruder/molester came in the night before the mother had come from work, hid in the basement... if I remember correctly, came up after the two were asleep, tied up the mother and the girl, molested her, tried on the mother's clothes... I'm pretty sure the garage sale tables and items were already set up, he just went out there in the morning for some reason I'll never know... "	t5_2t3t8	True
1354771274.0	14daul	Why meeting roommates on Craigslist is a bad idea...		341	62	65	"Sorry but be prepared for fairly long story. Here goes:

I was living in Hawaii and had to move to LA for work. I didn't know anyone, was fairly broke, and my job wasn't going to help with moving expenses so I resorted to scouring Craigslist for a room for rent. After literally thousands of scams or weirdos, I finally found this amazing girl. She was funny, we had similar interests, and she even worked in the same field as me. She didn't yet have a place, but her and another girl were looking at several houses that required a third roommate. They were totally OK with doing all the work seeing as how I was an ocean away. She called or Skyped with me about once a week, and sent me pictures of each house they looked at. All in all, she was incredible. 

Fast forward three months. They found a huge and gorgeous house, everything was settled, the two girls (Evann and Juliana) were moved in, and Evann (the original girl from CL) picked me and all my stuff up at the airport. On the ride home she starts telling me horror stories about her past roommates. Every single one had fucked her over in some horrendous way, and she was terrified of being close to people after that. She said she wanted us to be the people who turned that around for her, that she wanted us to be a little family. She then drove us not to the house but to a nearby Starbucks where she chain smoked and told me about her stepdad who was in AA and how she'd briefly been attending NA meetings after a short bout with painkiller addiction, but she had decided she wasn't a drug addict and didn't need it. THEN she admits that she's only known the other roommate for a month and a half. Red flags all over the place. Why would an LA native need to find strangers to live with her on CL? Why the oversharing about drugs and family? Why had she never had a positive roommate experience? But I pushed it all aside, giving this girl the benefit of the doubt. 

A few weeks go by in the house and all's well. I forget she ever seemed off and we start becoming close. Then she takes me on a tour of LA for a day and proceeds to tell me her entire disturbing life story. When I say we had gotten close, by no means were we close enough to make this appropriate. She tells me about her stepfather molesting her, getting sent to a mental hospital when she told on him because he's a doctor and said she was criminally insane, getting raped by a lesbian at the hospital and beaten by the guards, attempting suicide, her mother's severe narcotic addiction, her ex fiance having a psychotic break and trying to kill her, her struggles with a chronic kidney illness that required many surgeries, her recent long-term boyfriend disappearing under mysterious circumstances... the horrific stories just went on and on and on. It sounded like something from a movie, and a part of me questioned if it could all possibly be true, but again I give her the benefit of the doubt. 

Again, things go fine for a while and my doubts about her subside. Then my food starts disappearing. I ask both girls about it privately and Evann claims that the other girl, Juliana, had confessed to her that she was a compulsive overeater. Naturally, Juliana claims to be innocent. I side with Evann and we start mildly bullying Juliana to try to get her to admit to stealing the food. Then dishes start piling up in the sink and nobody is washing them except me. I ask both girls, and again Evann swears on her life that it's Jules. Finally Jules has had enough. It turns out she's been eating out every meal (we all had extremely different schedules) and Evann lied to my face about the dished and the food. When confronted, Evann starts crying and saying ""how could you accuse me of such things? I'm a good person! I'm a good person!"" and we end up apologizing to her in the end.

Finally the tension builds between the two girls due to many many many repeats of this situation, and one night when I'm at work they start fighting. Evann calls me saying Juliana hit her and she's afraid for her life. I call Jules and tell her to find a new place to live. Juliana goes to stay with friends, and within a week moves out. 

Now things get really weird. Evann moves out of the master bedroom and starts sleeping in the living room every night. After I repeatedly request that she return to living in her bedroom, she tearfully confesses that she's been on high dose opiates this whole time and is trying to ween herself off but it makes her too weak to walk downstairs to her room. Feeling sorry for her, I end up babysitting her for weeks while she withdraws. It was both terrifying and disgusting, but I really wanted to help her out. During this time I see her naked and realize that she has NO scars from her ""repeated surgeries"". Beyond that, she confides in me that she hasn't been working at all this entire time, but going out to score drugs and get high every day, and now she's flat broke. She apologizes for lying saying over and over that she's a sick sick addict and just needs help. I get her into AA and NA as soon as she's able to walk, driving her daily to meetings and holding her hand the whole time. 

My long-time boyfriend and her oldest friend move in with us a short while later, to help with bills. That's when it all goes from bad to unbearable. Evann goes to visit her mom one night and disappears for a week, returning very clearly high and claiming to be sober. She then starts going on many trips to visit friends in other states and is rarely home. When she is home, she babbles endlessly about how great sobriety is and how she's finally healing, while clearly nodding out on opiates. I end up finding something suspicious on her computer and she admits to me that she's been working as a call girl and bringing customers to the house. I tell her she has to stop and she claims she already has. 

Around this time she becomes very very physically ill. Finally I get a phone call from her after another absence. She's hysterical. She's, get this 6 MONTHS PREGNANT!!!! She didn't know because she was so high. The baby was severely malformed and there was no way of carrying to term. I comforted her, thinking that this trauma outweighed all the weird behaviors she exhibited. She had the procedure, and afterwards disappeared for almost a month. I thought at one point that she was dead until she texted me asking if her cat was ok. 

When she returned, she proceeded to start eating all of our food, using all of our toiletries, sleeping on the couch, and smoking inside the house (which was not ok with us at all). She was also very clearly on drugs. At first we tried to be nice about it but she lied and lied and lied, even going so far as to say her room was haunted and the ghost made her sleep upstairs. Finally my boyfriend snaps and yells at her. She calls the cops and claims he assaulted her. They didn't believe her but the other roommate did. Then one night when I'm at work she uses pity and sweet talking to convince my BF that we should all be friends again. I told him it was a lie and he didn't believe me. When I get home from work that same night, my room is trashed. I asked if he did it, and of course he didn't. She'd been in there looking for cash or drugs (which I don't do). When I asked her about it, she looked me straight in the eyes and said ""it was the ghost"". 

After that she started sending me insane emails claiming that I had been her best friend and had betrayed her, accusing her of heinous crimes and even convincing her she was a drug addict as a form of sick psychological torture. The emails get increasingly intense, becoming ten to twenty page diatribes about how she didn't feel safe in her own home and how I was the embodiment of pure evil, that my only purpose in life was to torment her. In these emails she claimed that she used drugs on rare occasion and that I had made up everything about her problem, that I had been verbally abusive about her abortion, and that we had repeatedly physically assaulted her. 

We were genuinely afraid for our safety, especially after the police showed up one day and took her in for a mysterious psychiatric hold. We never found out why she was carried out of the house, barefoot and handcuffed, by four LAPD officers. After that, we just tried to avoid her, but she got the other roommate involved. She even went to far as to claim she had pneumonia from the stress of living with us and our constant abuse. The emails continued to escalate. At one point she said that I had been a sister to her until the evil spirit in me had forced me to abuse her. This was when I realized that her definition of ""abuse"" was a bit skewed, and all her stories about her childhood, exes, old roommates, and even Juliana had been complete fabrications. Of course she didn't have scars from the surgeries; everything she said was a lie to garner sympathy so she could take advantage of people. 

Now I realized, of course, that she was completely mad. We found a new house and the night before moving out, I hacked into her email. Come to find out she had been telling our landlord that we were heinous criminals, telling her parents that she had been fired from a job because of me and needed money, all kinds of lies. Also, we come to find out that they guy who got her pregnant didn't mysteriously disappear, he ran away because they slept together once and she started stalking him. Obviously everything she had ever said was a creepy lie.

After moving out, the harassing emails and texts continued to the point that I had to have her blocked on both and seriously considered getting a restraining order. 

This was two years ago. Last month we found out that this girl who claimed to have never been a drug addict and that I made all of it up had died of an OD. She was evil. This wasn't a situation where nobody tried to help a sick person; everyone around her tried to help her and she manipulated and used them. I don't feel sad that she's gone. In fact, I still want to punch her in the face.

Sssecretsss	341	57	41	"I posted a few days ago about an [experience](http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1gg1mn/lets_play/) I had as a child and I thought that I'd had my share of creeps, but apparently not. I'm now 19(f).
                       
I'm currently on holiday in Sydney (Australia) with my family. Yesterday we decided to take the kids (I have a few nieces and nephews) into the city to go to the Aquarium. As most people know or can guess taking public transport into the city can be a big day when you have two three year olds and an eight month old baby with only two strollers (prams). By the time we finished at the aquarium we were all pretty tired, the kids and the parents especially. Being the good auntie I am, I offered to push one of the strollers.
                  
Now, when you get onto trains in Sydney, I don't know what it's like in other places, there's a small area with two rows of seats that face each other for disabled people and prams and such, then there are two sets of stairs, one leading up the other leading down to more seating. Since we had two prams we always just sat in the first little area.
           
So we get on the train and there's an older looking guy sitting at the end of one of the seats. He looked homeless, but I didn't really mind, I mean, it's a free country, if he wants to ride the train, that's fine. So I sit on the same side as him while the rest of my family sit on the other, except my niece who was asleep in the stroller that I had in front of me. Now, to any one who didn't know us, it would have looked like we were separate parties. My niece and I both have red hair while the others have brown, so it would have been a fair assumption to make that I was a young mother travelling alone with a small child.
              
Anyway, we're travelling along, quite happily when we reach the next station. I should add here that the stroller with my niece in it is turned to the side so I can see her (after my experience as a child I'm a bit safety paranoid). It's blocking a couple of seats, but no one else was there, and if they came on I'd move it, no problem. So we reach the station and a young guy jumps on the train and looks over at where I'm sitting. I immediately go to move the stroller, but he just heads downstairs, so I leave it. Apparently the guy sitting there doesn't like this and he starts to mutter.
                
At first I don't pay attention, because I assume he just thought I wasn't going to move it, and I figure that it's not my problem. After a while, though, it becomes harder to ignore what he's saying.
""Stupid fucking strollers. Stupid fucking strollers. Stupid fucking strollers.""
He repeats that for about a minute, then goes silent. At this time my niece wakes up and wants to hop into my arms, so I lift her up and the guy starts staring at her, checking her out. This makes me really uncomfortable, so I turn slightly so she's hidden from view. This also makes him angry.
""Fucking strollers. Turn away from me. Just wait. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. Do you hear? I'll kill you.""
I look over at my family and see that they're looking pretty freaked out and shocked. I decide to ignore it.
""I'm going to kill you and keep the kid.""
This time I was scared because unlike before, he didn't sound crazy or mental, he sounded really sane, like he could actually pull it off. We'd just pulled into a station and my brother jumped up and yelled ""Get off the train!"". The guy started laughing and grasping at his coat. It took me a moment to realise my brother was talking to me, not him. We all ran for the doors as they were closing. I heard the guy yell something out and turn to see him leaning on the closed doors with a knife in his hand.
         
We caught the next train after that. I'd left the stroller on the first train, so I had to carry my niece home. When we got home we were all pretty shaky. Today we managed to joke about it, but mainly because none of us want to think about what could have happened if we hadn't gotten off the train at that point."	t5_2t3t8	True
1347220744.0	zm694	[MP] Influx of fiction.	DragonShiryu2	336	57	51	"Hey guys, Dragon here.

I just wanted to say that it has been brought to my (and I'm sure many of you guys') attention that there has been an influx of fiction on this subreddit. And that's bad, okay? Rule number-freaking-one clearly states that ""this is for REAL encounters with REAL people."" so I want it to stay that way. I created this sub about nine months ago or so and I am extremely proud of it... except for as of late. I would like to remind EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU that this is a subreddit for REAL stories, not the incoherent ramblings of a misunderstood situation. 

EXAMPLE:

""OMG lik this guy waz tots being creepee and looked at me as i crozzzed the street. oooommmmmmmgggggg. lolupvote.""

That shit is the stuff we don't need here. Here's an excerpt from my favourite story on here:

""At the far end of the street, on my side, was the silhouette of a man, dancing. It was a strange dance, similar to a waltz, but he finished each ""box"" with an odd forward stride. I guess you could say he was dance-walking, headed straight for me.""

That is a creepy sentence all on its on, with or without context.


This subreddit needs to recover from what has happened to it; therefore I am calling for new mods. I'm back in school now, and Grade 12 is a major year so I won't be as active as I wish I could be. I am looking for two new mods, with a spot reserved for ThisIsAsinine if he so wishes to take it. So there will be a total of three new mods by.... Wednesday. Also, make sure to downvote and report fictional stories. Thanks for listening to the rant guys...

1376460842.0	1kc0fy	The creepiest thing that happened to me as a kid had a JusticePorn ending	Ruvvi	333	52	59	"For context- my brother is nearly 6 years older than me. By the time I was born my brother was already friends with a boy named Danny, who's younger sister, Sara, would eventually become my best friend as well. By the time I was 12 and my brother was around 18, Sara and I were inseparable and would spend a ton of time together. Danny had developed some problems involving learning disabilities and likely some form of autism, but he was still a nice guy who my brother spent time with. Unfortunately, these social problems lead Danny to make friends with some shady characters, most likely without his knowing so, and by the age of 18 he had quite a few friends in their mid twenties who weren't exactly the nicest kind of people.

One such friend was Matt. I cannot, for the life of me, understand why Danny and Sara's parents let this man into their home. I was unaware of it at the time, but he was around 21 and a regular cocaine user. Sara (a year older than me and a bit wiser at 13 than I was at 12) would often ask to stay at my house when Matt was over. One day Sara and I walked home from school together to find no one in her house but Matt. He told us he was waiting for Danny to arrive and that he'd opened the door with the spare key hidden under a planter outside. We quickly went to Sara's room and remained there with the door closed.

After a few minutes I left to use the bathroom. As soon as I'd closed the bathroom door it was pushed open again and Matt stepped in after me, quickly closing the door behind both of us. He's apologized and stated he hadn't thought anyone else was in the bathroom. Here I must point out that I was a chronically shy kid. I had a hard time ringing doorbells on Halloween and saying ""Trick or treat."" I was silent and wide eyed, I can't remember thinking anything at the moment. I completely froze.

Matt stood between me and the door for a few seconds before I managed to get out the words ""excuse me,"" and try to exit. He stopped me by grabbing my arm, said a few weird things that didn't make sense to me. Called me pretty and asked if I wanted to hang out with him alone more often. He asked if I wanted some money and pulled a wad of cash out of his pocket. By this point I knew what he was doing was wrong and I said, ""No."" I tried to squeeze past him again.

Just then Sara, my knight in shining armor, bust through the door. The door swung in and hit him in the back, providing enough distraction for me to escape past him. Sara grabbed my arm, and hauled me across to the hall to her room, shut the door, and barricaded it with a chair. While Matt knocked on (and tried to force open) the door and asked us to come out and ""talk about it"" Sara hurriedly whispered to me that her mother had told her *never* to be alone with him. I remember feeling more guilty than anything else, like I had broken some huge important rule and everyone would be angry with me. The kind of guilt that gives you and awful stomach ache and makes you want to throw up.

Eventually Matt left and when Sara's mom returned home we told her everything. I never saw Matt again after that. I tried very hard to just forget about the whole thing, but my brother found out about it through Danny. My brother proceeded to get together a group of his closest friends and beat the shit out of Matt and broke (at least) his arm. With a bat. He even tried to press charges against my brother, but dropped them after (I assume) he was reminded of the reason *why* someone would feel inclined to beat him with a bat.

1369924496.0	1fc6f3	Groomba	romeo_b	317	39	15	"When I was a kid, my sisters and I would go and stay with my grandparents for a week during the summer. My grandparents would take us to the pool to swim, take us to the fair, let us stay up late and let us order pizza at 11 o'clock at night if we wanted. They were the fun grandparents that any kid would be lucky to have. My grandpa was a funny man, always telling us stories that were most likely made up, and always making jokes.

He played a lot of games with us, and one of the games that we played was called ""Groomba"". He told us that a groomba was a polish monster that ate little kids in the middle of the night, and of course we didn't believe him, but when you are a kid it's always fun to be scared. When he decided that he wanted to give us a scare, he would start going around the house turning off all the lights one by one. We usually didn't even notice that he was doing it until most of the house was dark. There wasn't really a point to the game except trying to scare us. Sometimes he would go into the backyard through the sliding glass door in the master bedroom, his shirt over his head and dragging his feet. We would scream when we saw him through the window of the living room! At that point we would usually all go find a hiding place, and hope that he didn't catch us.

We always hid in pairs or groups, but one night, as I wedged myself among the shoes in the bottom of the master closet, my oldest sister decided she wasn't going to fit, and took off down the hallway to find another spot to hide. I was alone, and being about 10 at the time, I was terrified. As the sound of her footsteps faded down the hallway, all I could hear was the sound of my own breathing. Everyone was hiding. The house was silent.

Suddenly I heard the sliding glass door open. I froze. I could hear the shuffling of feet on the floor, and I tried not to make a sound. My heart was beating out of my chest. Even though I didn't hear him move from the doorway, I knew that at any moment, my grandpa was going to pull the closet door open and jump at me, or make some kind of scary noise to make me scream.

But the scream that came wasn't from me, it came from somewhere else in the house. It was my sisters. When the screams ended, the giggling began. My sisters muffled voices talking excitedly. My grandma laughing. And then, my grandpas muffled voice, praising them for the good hiding place.

The sliding door slammed shut, and I heard the footsteps on the concrete in the backyard, running. I stayed frozen in the closet for a long while, terrified to come out, not wanting to face the fact that someone else had been in the room with me moments ago.

Her older brother (16) also had a friend named Kyle over. Kyle molested me. He and the brother forcibly separated us, he molested me in one room while the brother assaulted his sister in the other.

When I told her mother, she scolded me and warned me not to tell anyone or my mother would be angry with me. I believed her for some reason. Georgia's parents totally ignored Kyle's behavior. He was so blatant about it that he tried to make me sit in his lap at lunch and put his hand in my swimsuit bottom in the car, with them in the front seat. I probably begged her at least three or four times to make him leave me alone, and she said ""he's just playing"".

Not long after, I broke out in a horrible painful rash all the way up to my belly button. I had to tell my mother. The police got involved and the whole story emerged. The older brother had been molesting my friend for years. Kyle got counseling because he was a juvenile, but he's now a registered sex offender, having been convicted of assaulting other young girls since. 

Fast forward to me at 17. We left the church where Georgia's family attended not long after all that happened, and we were going to another church across town. One day, someone taps me on the shoulder. I turn around, it's Georgia's mother. ""Oh hiiiiii!"" She exclaims and tries to wrap me in a big bear hug. ""We decided to move to this church, it's so great to see you here!"" Absolutely no recognition whatsoever of the past in her eyes.

I had nothing to say to her so I immediately excused myself. The next sunday, the whole family (big pedo brother included) comes up and starts talking to me like we're old friends. ""how's the family"" and ""You've gotta come over and try this pasta Georgia makes"" type shit.

 Huge fake grins and constant attempts at giving me hugs. This makes me so uncomfortable I can't even describe it. I make every attempt possible to make it obvious I don't want to talk to them, but they kept persisting. They wanted out phone number, to go to movies and bbqs. They tried to invite themselves to my sister's birthday party for god's sake. Why?! I've never been able to figure out why. They kept it up for months.

It was the final straw in me giving up on organized religion. I stopped going just to avoid them."	t5_2t3t8	True
1343688375.0	xf045	Still can't figure this one out to this day	speedk0re	317	42	71	"Real quick, just discovered this sub today and love it.

Anyways I guess technically this is my Mom's story, but it's one of the scariest things I remember from my childhood.  My parents were divorced so I lived with my single Mom and brother, and my brother had just left for the military so it was just my Mother and I at the time.  My bedroom was downstairs and her bedroom was upstairs; pretty much the complete opposite corners of the house.  There was a porch door on her bedroom that led to our fenced backyard.

So around 1 or 2 in the morning one night I woke up to the sound of her screaming and the sound of someone running down the stairs.  She ran into my room and although this was about 22 years ago I still clearly remember the look of absolute terror on her face.  She had woken up to the sound of her porch door being slid open.  She looked over half asleep and a man she had never seen before was walking into her bedroom.  Now this is the strange part.  She told me he was completely soaked from head to toe in water, and wearing nothing but a bathing suit.  We didn't have a pool, none of our neighbors had pools, and there were no lakes or bodies of water anywhere nearby.  I know this for a fact because as an 11 year old growing up in NY, being friends with the kid that had a pool was a priority.  And the closest friend with a pool was my friend Jonathan, who lived at least 2 miles away.

So obviously freaked out of her mind she said as she started to jump from bed that he grinned at her and started taking his bathing suit off.  That was when she sprinted out of her bedroom, slammed the door behind her, and ran down the stairs and into my room.  Now looking back I have no idea why the fuck I did this or even more puzzling, why my Mother let me do this, but instead of calling the cops and staying locked in my bedroom with her, I grabbed my BB Gun and slowly walked back up the stairs towards her bedroom.  My Mom had called 911 at this point but I didn't know it yet.  So, shaking uncontrollably, I stared at the closed door for about 2 minutes trying to listen but I didn't hear anything.  Finally with my BB Gun drawn I flung the door open and thank Christ he wasn't in there.  The porch door was wide open though, and there was a soaked bathing suit in the middle of the floor.  At that point I went back downstairs and sat with her in my locked bedroom while waiting for the cops to show up.

They got there surprisingly quick and were just as confused as we were by the situation.  They went outside on the porch and confirmed that there were wet spots where the guy had been standing for god knows how long, collected the bathing suit, and told us they would have someone patrolling the area for the rest of the night and for a few days afterwards.  I never heard anything so I guess the dude never got caught or who knows, but the next day my Mom agreed that it was time to get a dog which I'd been begging her for.  So at least that worked out."	t5_2t3t8	True

Last week I get there and we make one lap around then she raises the hair up on her back and starts growling. She then charges forward growling and barking at a man sitting down. He didn't even flinch which was odd, although she never got close enough to actually hurt him. I walk up and apologize profusely, I am extremely embarrassed that she would misbehave. He then looks me dead in the eye with a blank expression ""It's ok. He has arrived. He is here."" 

I call my dog and walk away. The guy stands up and follows me telling me the devil is in my dog. The first time I thought he was making a reference to dobermans being referred to as devil dogs when they were in the war, but he keeps repeating it. I change directions and cut across the park yet he keeps telling me there is no way to get the Devil out of my dog unless I kill her. 

I get a little freaked out because I don't want him to hurt my dog. I put her on a leash and he keeps repeating to me that the Devil is everywhere and that it is unfortunate that he has entered her but that I need to kill her now. It's late in the afternoon so there's not a lot of people there so I decide to leave. I exit the gate and he keeps following me repeating the same stuff. 

I get in my car and he's standing in front of it, as I backed out he yelled ""Embrace the devil.""

1365456262.0	1bxzyh	Friend's Stepdad Wants to 'Deflower' Me	bellatrixie	345	72	14	"When I was 14, I went to school about 30 miles from home, so understandably, I didn't see my school friends very often on the weekends. I was so excited when I finally got the chance to stay over at my friend's house, as she was much more popular than I was and I thought this might be my chance to cement myself in the 'cool' group at school.

My friend had always been very popular with the boys, mostly because she was very flirtatious and what I would call a tease today. It was only as an adult that this behavior made more sense. 

So I get to my friend's house and I meet her parents. I should preface this by saying that my parents had NOT met her parents when they agreed to let me stay over. NOT something I'll allow with my own son! Anyway, in regards to her stepdad I immediately feel that uneasy feeling you get when you meet someone dangerous. I feel like most girls/women are equipped with some sort of sixth sense that helps them determine which men mean them harm.

But... as I said, popularity is at the forefront of my mind so I push aside my feelings and try to enjoy my time with my friend. I can already tell that they have an interesting relationship though, as they seem far more intimate than my father would ever be with me. I can't totally explain it, other than to say that it's now clear that he had already been sexually abusing my friend and for some time. 

The most terrifying moment came while my friend was out of the room for a few minutes. This guy wasted no time in sidling up to me, telling me how beautiful I was and how he could tell I was 'fresh', a virgin. I was freaking petrified. He then tells me that he would very much like to be the one to take my virginity. That he has done it before and that the girls have enjoyed it. That I would enjoy it, too.

I can't remember exactly what I said, as it's been 18 years now but I'm sure I mumbled something about not being interested and my friend miraculously came back in the room. You could tell by her face that she knew something was going on and she seemed so apologetic. As if it were somehow her fault. I get so angry when I think about her trying to make the situation okay for me.

I spent the rest of the night on hyper-guard, though he never made another advance. He basically stayed away from us, maybe because he suddenly realized that I might tell my parents. But he needn't worry about that. For all the times my parents told me as a young child to tell them if anyone ever tried to touch me, they never really talked to me as a young adult. I stuffed this incident down inside and never told anyone until I met my husband.

I moved up in the ranks of the 'cool' people so I guess I got what I wanted in the end. But I can't stand to think of this incident too much or else I get really mad. I also worry that no matter how much I tell my son to tell me if something bad happens to him, he might not. "	t5_2t3t8	True

I moved into this apartment complex about 2 years ago. It's not exactly in the best part of town. As a 21 year old, 110 lb. female living alone, I look like a pretty easy target. Naturally, there were 3 burglary attempts within the first 2 months. Unfortunately for them.. I have a sleeping disorder, a twisted sense of humor, and they're terrible criminals. I'll just go with the first attempt.

The porch area leading to the front door is designed so that my bedroom window is directly in front of it. So if I'm at my bedroom window, I'm standing right next to my front door. Sorry, I hope that makes sense.
One Friday night around 3AM, I'm reading in the living room when I hear my doorknob gently rattling. I sneak into my bedroom and peek through the blinds. Of course, two guys in black hoodies are crouched in front of my door with this little tool kit, trying to figure out how to break in. I'm not really worried because these guys look completely clueless, so I grab my phone and sit on my bedside table to watch. 5 minutes pass and I've hatched a plan. Remember, I'm about 2-3 feet away from them. I grabbed my .357 Magnum from the drawer, flung open the blinds, pointed it directly at one's face, and put on the most classic Joker-esque smile I could muster.

1364142035.0	1ax2dk	Professor Creeper waits for me at the bar.		311	37	26	"An important detail to the story- this all happened in a small city in China, with me being an American (white, female) foreign student studying Chinese at the time. Keep that in mind.

When I first arrived in this country I really enjoyed going out and drinking with my friends. Back then everything was so fun and new, and I wanted to experience the night life most of all. Whenever we would go to the bars in the university district of town, we always seemed to happen across professors from our school. They're always excited to meet foreign students so they usually treat us to drinks and chat with us. One day we came across a computer science teacher from our university- a 28 year old guy named Mr. Qu.

Mr. Qu always seemed way too friendly and a little awkward towards me. But he was genuinely nice, helpful and friendly. We exchanged phone numbers and texted eachother often. Most weekends we would end up running into eachother at the bar while out with friends. After a while, I started to get the feeling he had a crush on me. He always said things that were a little too sweet- a little too flattering- and it became pretty obvious after a while. I made it a point to keep my distance from him, and to not reciprocate his sweet words. 

After not seeing him for a few weeks time- he texts me at 9pm one night and asks if I've ever tried Baijiu- which is a traditional Chinese liquor that's basically 60% alcohol. I said I hadn't. He said I should come to the usual bar and he'd buy a bottle so I could taste. At first I agreed out of politeness, and then after 10 minutes of thinking about it, I realized just how inappropriate it is to go meet this guy alone and drink with him. So I immediately text him again and come clean, telling him that I really shouldn't see him again. And that was that. End of story. I really didn't hear from him again. 

But the story isn't *quite* done yet... 

The lady who owns the bar we usually frequent is a good friend of a classmate's. What I heard from my classmate three days afterwards totally shocked and horrified me. Later I would go to the bar to confirm the story with the owner, just to make sure it's all true. 

It goes like this. Apparently Mr. Qu comes into the bar like he does almost every weekend. Just after 9 he orders a bottle of Baijiu and pours  two glasses. He says to the servers that he's waiting for a girl. Later the girl never comes. He ends up staying anyways and singing some karaoke, getting really drunk and having fun with the servers, who usually pour themselves a few drinks and loosen up on a slow night.  

A server finds a small glass of Baijiu on the table and drinks it, probably thinking it was his. Shortly after, the night winds down and Mr. Qu leaves. They start cleaning up. Then one server starts acting a little funny. Not drunk funny- more like *high* funny. He starts stumbling around, taking off his clothes, making disturbing noises and eventually falling over, passing out.

The drink Mr. Qu poured for me that night was laced with some kind of drug. His plan was to get me high or passed out, and then take me back to his place and advantage of me. When I relayed this story to another good friend- he said ""yeah- it's not the first time he's done that with a female student."" Great, I just wished you had told me that earlier.

Thank god I had come around and decided not to see him that night, or ever again. I guess the moral of the story is to pay attention to your feelings. If something *feels* wrong, creepy, inappropriate, or whatever- it probably is!

Last Easter (my dog was only about 3 month old at the time), I took her out to do her thing before going to bed. This was around 1:30 am.
We went to the yard, pitch black (street lights are kind of far away so the only light out was from peoples windows.
She's doing her thing, and I'm talking to her. I look up and look into my neighbours yard (no fence, just 2 medium sized trees are between our yards), and I see this tall man. I'm guessing around 2 meters tall.
The guy is around 3-4 meters away from me, and just stands there and stares.

All the sudden he starts walking from the yard towards the street. I do the same (my front door was open, didn't want to risk anything). When I come to my door, I see the guy. He stands in front of my neighbours house and he just stares back. I stood there for about 2 minutes, just trying to see what the fuck he was doing.
Than he start walking up the stairs of the house and it looks like he's going in. At that point I decide that I just have a creepy neighbour and go in to my apartment.

I sit down on the couch and continue watching the Tv. Than I start seeing someone blocking a beam of light that comes in through my curtains. And again it gets blocked .... was like someone was walking in my yard.
I mute the TV, but hear nothing (the weather was very cold so the grass was crispy).
I stand up,and lift my curtains up (note that I live in a basement), and there he is. Our faces were too close to each others, on the opposite side of the window.
I managed to keep my cool and stared back.
The guy just stood up and walked slowly away in the crispy grass (went to my neighbours yard again).

I freaked out and called the cops.

And now, maybe 1 month ago, I'm watching Tv with the dog. All the sudden she starts growling, hairs on the back go up and teeth showing.
There he was again, same window.

Now I always have the curtains down, have a security system and always take a flash light with me to the yard if its dark."	t5_2t3t8	True

We passed a few dilapidated Victorian homes as we neared the downtown. Suddenly I heard a soft voice saying ""Rachel."" Not even as a question, just a simple statement of my mother's name. She kind of looks around and sees this man sitting on a worn out bench from a particularly rough looking home. 
""Jason?"" She asks. He skulks out of the shadows of the porch and meets us at the gate.
""Rachel."" He says again. He has a very high-pitched effeminate voice. He asks who I am, and my mother introduces me. We get into a conversation about where I've been for the summer (to Cali) and he mentions his family lives up there. He seems rather polite and I don't really notice anything strange about him. There's a lull in the conversation and Jason looks to my mother, suddenly serious.

""Can I ask you something?"" he asks her hesitantly. 
""Of course,"" she says, smiling. 
""Have we been talking.... like this?"" He gestures from his head to hers, obviously asking if they've had a telepathic communication.
My mom just smiles back and says ""Nope."" He looks at her, completely in disbelief.
""Are you sure..?""
""Yep."" She says, still smiling. As a little explanation for my mom's reaction, she is a school psychologist and is very patient and professional dealing with people in all sorts of situations. It was very remarkable, as I was completely uncomfortable and wanted to just walk away awkwardly.
Jason then goes on to talk about how he just recently got his psychic powers and they haven't developed completely yet. Then goes off on a tangent on past lives, mentioning that he knows who my step father was in a past life, but not my mom. Then continues on to talking about his dead mother who committed suicide, but he knows now that she's in a better place and he's doing much better.
My mom tells him she's glad he's feeling better, and that we have to go because my grandma is babysitting my brothers. 

As we walk to my house I ask her ""He's schizophrenic, isn't he?""
""Paranoid schizophrenic. He visits the shop regularly (the bike shop my parents owned at the time). He's taken quite a liking to Chad (my step father.) Jason's come over to our house a few times, and it's been really hard to make him leave. Chad will be making dinner and saying 'Well, I really need to make dinner for the kids so you better go...' And Jason will just respond 'Oh! What are you making for dinner?' He really creeps me out so I've tried to get Chad to keep him away from the house.""
At this time my stepfather was away on a week-long backpacking trip with his friends. So it was just my mom, two of my brothers (6 months and 6 years) and me at the house. With this in mind, I told her not to worry and that if Jason tried to come to the house, I'd protect her. (I've been in Kung Fu a few years, and I am definitely too cocky about such things, especially as small as I am, but anyway...) 

So a few days later, I drive home and not two hours into my trip, I get this phone call from my mother. She's calm as ever, but I could tell she was a bit more shaken up than she was letting on. My mom told me she had been napping in her room with the baby when she heard my younger brother Derek talking. She didn't think anything of it until she heard someone else respond and Derek say ""She's in her room."" So Jason walks into the room with her lying on the bed with the baby. My mom then proceeds to tell him to leave and that this isn't a good time. He makes excuses and tells her he needs to be there. She gets more and more frantic as the minutes go by, still he wont leave and her phone is in the living room. At one point he asks her ""Oh, am I scaring you?"" She tells him ""Yes, you're scaring me, and you need to leave now."" He tries to calm her down and apologizes for scaring her but that he knows he can help the family. ""I was in love with Chad in a past life,"" he keeps saying. 
Finally my mom picks up the baby and walks into the kitchen with Jason still following her and calls the cops, after about 30 minutes. They escort him off the property. However, he left his bike there so she put it out on the road. My mom called my stepfather and he came back from his vacation the next day.
Cops patrolled the house at night and one evening they caught him trying to break in. As far as I know, he's in jail at the moment.

What kills me is that I had barely left the house. I could have been there to help, to scare him off, or call the cops, at least. It kills me to know that my mom was caught off-guard, sleeping with the baby, and that my little brother Derek was alone with that man. Now, I don't think Jason would have hurt them. I believe he was more of a danger to himself. But you never know. And next time it could be someone who does intend to hurt them. Poor Derek is really shaken up after that, too. Needless to say, my parents have been locking up much more regularly. 

And this is why I want to be a criminal psychologist.

1345699470.0	yojwl	Fighting off a horny 10-year-old	clash_by_night	322	48	59	"For weeks I've been lurking and finally decided to share a story. 


I wish this hadn’t happened to me, but it did. 


I went to college in New Orleans a couple of years before Hurricane Katrina (I was a senior when it hit). During my first year, I had no car, so I had to take the bus everywhere. 


One afternoon, I went shopping in a not-so-great part of town (New Orleans East). Not particularly bad, but kind of poor and a little seedy. Even though I was a young woman walking around the city alone, I never really felt unsafe. Well, that was about to change. 


I had a couple of shopping bags and was waiting at the bus stop, ready to go back to the dorm. At this time of day, this was fairly desolate stretch of road. There were two buses that passed by this stop, but only every hour at the most. I had a bit of a wait ahead of me. The stop was near a levee (dirt embankment meant to keep the water from the lake/river out of the city – the things that broke when Katrina hit). Behind the levee were only train tracks and water. Pretty much, I was standing on a deserted road, in a crummy part of town, with nothing but water, pavement, and rail road tracks. 


I felt okay, though. I had my cell phone, it was still light, and the bus would be along eventually. 


I waited and waited and waited. No bus. Then I heard a voice behind me. I turned and saw a boy coming over the levee and walking towards me. He was about 10, so I wasn’t really leery of him, as I would have been of a grown man. I was a good foot taller, at least. 


I didn’t know where he had come from, as there weren’t any houses anywhere near the direction he’d come from. Railroad tracks and a big lake were all that were there. He wasn’t waiting on the bus. He came up to me and started asking what was in the bags and if I’d show him. Typical kid, I guess. Kind of strange, but not too creepy. I tried to brush him off and ignore him. It didn’t work. 


He started grabbing for the bags and being more insistent that I give him something. I didn’t have anything that would interest a kid, just some clothes and groceries. He refused to leave, though. 


Then it got creepy. He started to grab at me, not the bags. He started rubbing his hips against my leg and trying to hug me/dry hump me. I was thoroughly grossed out and tried to walk away. He walked with me and tried to jump up and kiss me. Ugh. I mean, he was a kid. This was way too sexual behavior for a kid. Too sexual for anyone at a bus stop! 


I looked around for anyone who could help, but there wasn’t anyone. I could have walked back to the stores, but then I’d miss the bus. I decided to just walk down the road to the next stop, hoping the kid would go back home or wherever it was he came from. 


That’s when he decided to grab me again, by the arm, and tried to pull me up the levee. Uh, no. I pushed him off me, loathe to touch him. He was sticky, as kids tend to be, and sweaty. Plus, he’s a creeper, but still a kid. I was a little bigger than he was, and I didn’t want to hurt him. He told me that I should come to his house, which was apparently on the other side of the levee, as he pointed. 


I don’t think so. No one builds a house on the water side of the levee. Levees are built to keep water away from the houses. He couldn’t possibly live on the other side of it. I wasn’t going anywhere with this kid, so I kept walking. 


He followed me, still insisting that I come to his house. He said no one was home and there was a bed and we could have sex. What?!?! I was 19 at the time and he looked to be about 10. 


Luckily, my boyfriend called my cell phone and the kid seemed to take that a little more seriously than my method of shoving and yelling at him. Good, because I was about ready to hurt him just to get away. I stayed on the phone with my boyfriend and told him what the kid was doing. (I don’t know why it never occurred to me to call the cops. I guess because it’s New Orleans and cops don’t show up too quickly unless it’s the Quarter.) 


The kid ran up on the levee, back where he’d come from, and disappeared. I walked down to the next bus stop (maybe about a ¼ mile from the original stop). As I waited, praying a bus would come soon, I heard rocks hitting the pavement. I turned and saw the kid crouching on top of the levee, throwing rocks at me. I had been annoyed and creeped out before, but this was starting to actually get dangerous. They were good-sized rocks, and sharp. 


A few minutes later, the bus came, and I got on. It wasn’t the right one, but I didn’t care at that point. I took a ride to the casino about a mile or two down the road, where the driver let me get a transfer to the right bus. I made it back to my dorm room and never went back to that part of town alone again. 


I kind of wonder what the deal was, though. I don’t know if the kid had issues, or what would have happened if I had gone with him to his “house” on the other side of the levee. For all I knew, there could have been a group of guys back there using the kid to lure me out of sight so they could do god-knows-what to me. 


TL;DR: while waiting for bus, kid tries to convince me to have sex with him, throws rocks at me when I refuse

1330865747.0	qh4ac	I creeped out [MY] creeper!	alwannisch	317	41	33	"So three bits of important background information: 1) At the time of this event I dressed hobo-chic. 2) I have this weird eye condition where my tear ducts don't function properly and sometimes they get stuck shut so my eyes get dry and then my eyes try to produce a bunch of tears but they're stuck behind the tear duct opening so the pressure builds up until the ducts are forced open: aka resulting in literal streams of tears coming out of my eyes. 3) my grandparents (and parents less so) spoke Pennsylvania dutch (actually a dialect of German) and as a child I would talk to my grandparents in the dialect but they died when I was a pre-teen and I began to study Standard German and was studying German in college when this event took place.


So, I used to live on right outside of NYC awhile back in college. One night I went into the city to see friend perform at a comedy club(but a little tiny one not a professional one). The show lasted a lot longer than I expected and I ended up talking and drinking with my friend for an hour or two ""backstage"" (keep in mind this was a shitty small venue that he actually didn't even get paid for). However, he lived in the city and when I finally left alone I found myself walking through the city at 3. Although I was in somewhere in Manhattan I was in a poorer residential area and there was hardly anyone out. So as I'm walking down the street I notice a white guy (about 23-26) sitting on the side of the street up ahead. He was pretty rough looking (albeit rather good looking) and as I got closer he was obviously fucked up. I was pretty drunk to be honest and I probably looked it. I remember having an ill feeling about him but I'd always been told to not show fear and to walk as if you belong there. So I forced myself to not to go all stiff or change my stride or pace as I walked by. Lost in his own world, he didn't notice me till I was very close and my heart dropped when I heard the stillness broken. ""Ain't you a pretty sight!"" Thanks to the alcohol I didn't flinch or react much at all. Thinking I hadn't heard he yelled after me ""Honey, these are dangerous streets for a pretty thing like you!"" My heart was thumping so hard but I had already been walking fast the entire time and I wouldn't let myself pick up the pace (not wanting to look afraid). It was silent for a bit and I thought I was fine. ""Where's you going? Lemme walk ya! I gotta pad too!"" His voiced didn't sound farther away this time and I heard his footsteps, but he was a lot more fucked up than me and he wasn't walking nearly as fast. 

Now comes the stupid mistake:


I saw a stairwell to the subway I wanted and I walked down it. I immediately knew I fucked up. He had obviously seen me descend down there but the train was just leaving and the plat form was now empty. Adrenaline pumping through me, I only just noticed I felt an ""eye"" episode coming on. Scared shitless looking down the tunnel waiting for the next train to come, I hear footsteps. I force myself to not turn around. I hear someone struggle to jump the turnstile. ""Sweetie why you ignoring me?"" I said nothing. I could tell he was a good couple yards behind me. Then he got mad. ""Fucking stuck up bitch"". Then I heard him walking up behind me... and honestly I don't know why I did what I did. 

This whole time I hadn't looked back but I couldn't help looking back now. But catching his eye, I instantly had the urge to look away and touch my hair. But for some reason I hit myself hard in the head instead, and then started scratching my scalp really vigorously. I started flaring my nostrils, clearing my throat, and scratching my face hard as well. I basically did that as he put his hand on my shoulder, but I guess he was surprised by the scratching fit and let go and took a few steps back. It was right then that my eyes just started pouring (but keep in mind not crying so no sounds or anything and when I had just looked back a moment before he got a good glimpse of my face and saw there were no tears). He was still for a few seconds. A bit confused I think. Then I felt that he was edging around to get a look at my face. Now I hadn't spoken PA dutch in a long while when as he was almost able to look me in the face I don't have a clue why but I suddenly turned to him and just said ""Awwer alldieweil, hot die Daab die Katz im Aag ghatt."" (But all the while the dove had its eye on the cat). It's a proverb my grandpa would say meaning that sometimes whom you're plotting against is really plotting against you (or it also sort of means you never know who has an ace up their sleeve/don't underestimate people) .
So I was dressed in all second hand clothes, had a face full of tears about 15 seconds after he had seen my face without tears and I hadn't started crying, and I was speaking a language at him that he had probably never even heard. I bet I looked crazy! He asked me ""what?"" and took some steps back. and I started scratching more and began to walk towards him just speaking more random phrases and he looked pretty freaked out and left! I mean he was really fucked up on some drugs so I probably scared him hahah!

1330489702.0	qau6q	Guy at work (thi just happened TONIGHT)		329	55	124	"(Back story)So I'm 21 with a 9 month old baby girl. While I work my parents watch my munchkin for me since she has severe stranger danger. I'm a Walmartian. I hate Wal-Mart with a fiery passion and am trying so hard to find another job that will work with my schedule. This incident just happened tonight, 2 hours ago an has now put EXTREME fire to trying to find another job. On to the incident. 

I'm a cashier at Walmart. I work the evening shift till about 11 at night. Tonight started out a normal night like any other. Just cashiering away until they asked if I could help push carts. I agreed cuz they needed help. I was out pushing carts, not thinking a thing about it because I had an early ending shift today. I was walking to get another set of carts when I noticed a man standing by the corral just starin at me. I stopped in my tracks and went to another corral. For 33 minutes the man continued to stare at me everywhere I went. I decided it was time to go back inside to me actual job. About an hour later the man had found himself inside by Arvest, right by my register, and was just staring at me. I had my CSMS call AP and have the guy removed cuz he was major creepin me out. They removed him and I went about my business. 25 minutes later he was standing behind me and took a deep breath. He was smelling me!!!! AP had him removed again and watched me the rest of the night. My shift ended and I asked for an escort to my car seeing as how I was super afraid. The guy was standing by my car, drivers side, touching it. When he saw that I wasn't alone he walked away. I'm sitting at home scared shitless thinking what if he finds me.????? He found my damn car out of an entire parking lot!!! 

SORRY FOR THE WALL OF TEXT



EDIT: he came back tonight... Escorted off by police. Had 3 knives and a machete on him. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1372848450.0	1hk656	Locked in and Locked out	sinenox	313	40	47	"Warning: Longest story ever. Sorry. Meat of the story begins after the line below. 

At the time this took place I was in high school, living in a nice area. I had always wanted to get a job so as soon as I was legally allowed I called up all of the veterinary clinics in the region and filled out applications. The place where I was hired was a medium-sized clinic in a less-nice local town, closer to a large US city. I have plenty of horror stories (animal and human alike) from this time experience, but this one is probably the most human-oriented. My job was to tech (help the doctors do injections, surgeries, etc) and do general kennel duties, which mostly involved cleaning cages. 

There are only three more things you need to know before I can get to the meat of this. First, there were two shifts: opening to early afternoon, and late afternoon to midnight. Due to my school schedule and general preference I often worked nights and spent most of my shift alone in the place or with one other person, since we usually worked in pairs. Second, the doctor who owned the clinic got some kind of tax incentive to hire kennel staff through a program that tried to place mentally-ill people. Since I was the only one who didn't complain about working with these people, I was almost always paired with one. It doubled my work load generally, but they left me alone so I didn't really mind. Finally, the general layout of the place was [this](http://i.imgur.com/SEDxclO.png).  
____________________________________
On the night of this story I was working with a woman who was very disabled. She was supposed to clean the cages and mop the floors and such but I generally tended to do all of that over once she was done so we didn't get yelled at in the morning. She was very nice, seemed mostly functional, but very child-like, and prone to drama and tantrums. I don't remember her name, but Shelly seems fine. 

Everyone had left a bit early for the day for whatever reason, around 3PM. We had until midnight, and there was plenty of work to do. It was nearly a full house in terms of boarding and ill animals that had come in earlier in the day. I was admittedly a bit frazzled because I'd nearly been bitten by a cat that no one had labeled as being on rabies watch (thanks guys) and one of the large dogs I had to handle a few times that night had bitten a girl my height and age earlier in the day. 

At one point around 5PM when I was taking that dog to the outdoor run to do his thing, I looked up and noticed that there were people in the very back of our parking lot, up against the fence. I could only see them because I was behind the building like they were. It was a guy in a longer rain coat, balding on top, weird around the temples, and a woman. The guy's pants were around his ankles and he was pounding the woman, who he appeared to be pushing over and holding her hair. I assumed it was a prostitute. This caught me off guard, and I froze for a moment, pretty sure they hadn't heard me. Just as I'm backing away to go back inside the man looks up and gets this...what I can only describe as a predatory look on his face, grinning at me. It was oddly chilling, but I merely grimaced at him and quickly went back in. I avoided putting dogs outside for a bit, and then only walked them to and from the door. When I glanced out again they were gone. I figured I had over-reacted since I was already jumpy. 

Around 9PM I finally get my lunch break, and after telling Shelly I head out the back door to the Taco Bell across the street, the only thing nearby. I feel the odd sensation of being watched as I'm walking, and I note that there are fewer people on the street than usual (likely a holiday). After grabbing my food I head back, but I still see no one. Because I can't shake the feeling, I pick up my pace and jog back to the door quickly. As I'm fumbling for my keys, still scanning the empty parking lot in the dark, I notice a small movement. Something shiny, under one of the cars. It's a shoe. Someone is ducking down behind it. Then I'm inside and the door locks automatically. I tell Shelly not to go outside and go upstairs to eat. After thinking about it for a while I decide not to call the cops, because it's probably that couple going at it again. Besides, it's another 3-4 hours until I get out, and that's a long time for creepy to wait. 

More drudgery. At what I figure had to be around 10:20, I hear voices. I turn off the radio in the room upstairs and lean out the door to listen. It's Shelly, but she's not just talking/singing to herself as usual, she's arguing with someone. I'm down the stairs in a blink, and she's talking out the back door, raising her voice now in confusion and frustration. 

Shelly: ""I don't know how to get there! I told you I don't know...why do you still ask me things I don't know the answer to?!""

I have yet to hear him speak, but I'm alarmed that he's at the back door which is hidden, instead of the front entry. I edge off the stairs so that I can see around the door, and sure enough it's the same guy. The moment he sees me, he gets the creepiest fucking smile on his face, and starts to advance as though he's going to come inside. I immediately shove the door back but he fights it from the other side. Bad news. Luckily I'm surprisingly strong for my size and I'm wearing work boots for traction so even after he sticks an elbow in the door I'm still throwing myself against the door yelling ""NOT TODAY, FUCKER...GET BACK. GET OUT OF HERE. (CALL THE COPS.) GET. OUT. (GIVE ME THE BLEACH.)"" and within a few seconds I give him enough room to take his arm back and when he pulls it out I throw myself against it and the door shuts. And locks automatically. 

It's metal, but the ones in the front are glass. Shelly is crying. I tell her that everything is fine, but very sternly not to open any doors for anyone unless I tell her to. She agrees. I go to reception and call the cops. They say it was likely the guy was confused, or didn't understand where he was, and not to worry. They promise to send some guys over to search the lot and surrounding area and call me back. I do perimeter walks inside until they do, securing everything even remotely questionable. Every time I hear a strange thump I have to go investigate it by myself, with a flashlight. They call back and say that they went over it a few times, and there was no one there. Probably scared him off. Call back if we have any more problems. 

Okay. Fine. Good. Now I'm behind on my work, but I have a ride coming at midnight (thank goodness I didn't drive myself that day). So I hurry up and get going on the rest of it. As I'm managing the IVs on some of the surgery patients from that day, one of them, a giant rottweiler, goes to the bathroom in his cage. It's mostly blood. Shit. That's not good. He continues to bleed from the anus. I'm going to have to take him to emergency. I call one of the doctors to confirm. Shelly takes the phone and histrionically screams that the dog is bleeding in to the receiver. Helpful. They say to get him to the emergency clinic the next town over ASAP. So, there is a work vehicle there that I can use, but I can't keep him stable and drive at the same time. Also it's going to take an hour to do the paperwork and etc and our own work is way behind, and we're not supposed to run overtime. I consider leaving Shelly there but obviously I can't do that. She can't really be trusted to make good decisions. So I decide to take everything and try to coach Shelly on how she needs to hold the dog in the car. She protests that she doesn't want to go anywhere. But starts to whine and flip out when I say I have to go, because she doesn't want to be left alone. Finally I convince her. I get the gear, find the keys, we're going. 

I pause just as I'm about to open the back door. I just have that sinking, creepy feeling again. There are no windows on that side of the building. The cops took forever to respond last time. I decide to call someone and have them on the phone while we walk out. Still, it feels wrong. The dog is still bleeding. I run back up to the front to look out the windows, and I see nothing, though I still feel watched. Then I notice there are shoe prints near the front door, from the recent rain. Someone could have just taken shelter on their walk. Maybe. I go to the back and decide to walk out on the run, which is fenced in and covered, to see if anyone is visible in the lot. I wait. No one is there. It's decided then. I turn around to go and I hear a noise. The creepy feature emerges from the landscape, like some kind of fucking awful Where's Waldo game that I just lost. He's still smiling like a demon, but I think he's trying to tone it down. He's trying to talk to me, all questions. He puts his hand on the rusty fence and shakes it. It is pretty flimsy. I'm noping backwards with speed but the door wont open. Shelly has been watching the whole thing and she's freaking out. She's scared of him getting in, since I said he was a bad guy, so she has locked the door. She is locked in the building. I am locked in the open air run. Creeper is trying to get in to the run ever more aggressively, all while trying to act like we're just, you know, having a fucking conversation at 11PM. Like my fucking his arm up was just a common greeting. 

Me: Shelly, open the door!

Shelly: No he's bad I don't want him coming in here. 

Me: Shelly, please! Open the door!

Shelly: No..I don't...I don't want...

Me: OPEN THE DOOR RIGHT NOW! 

Shelly: You're being mean to me, I don't want...(starting to walk away)

CF: It's fine..are you worried about me? It's fine. Do you work here? (violently shaking the chainlink, then trying to squeeze around the side) Do you work here?

Me: Shelly! I'm sorry. I have to...[animal name] is hurt, and he needs us to help him, remember? And you want to help him, right? And you need me to help you...but I can't help protect you or [animal name] unless you let me in! 

Shelly: ...Ok...ok..yeah...but... Promise you aren't mad at me!

Me: I promise! Yes!

Finally I get back inside. The rott is smiling, laying in a pool of his own blood. The fence has gone quiet. The door to the outdoor run wont lock, and the inner door leading to the main area doesn't have a lock. Shit, shit! Also, if he's willing to break a fence he'll break that glass. I dial 911 and tell them to get over here. I also tell them I might not be here, and where I'm en route to, and to call me back when they get there. Then I call my dad (by now it's 11:45ish) and ask him to get up and help me transport an injured animal. While we wait, the dogs in the runs are barking. 

Creepy was gone by the time my dad and the cops got there. The rott got the attention he needed and was just fine afterwards. When I got yelled at the next day for not finishing the mopping I put in my 2 weeks notice (I'd worked there over a year), told everyone else about the guy, and never left alone at night again. 

TL;DR - Aggressive creeper with unknown intentions tries to break in to our clinic after hours, complicated by emergency situation and babysitting.

1354955848.0	14hpga	The guy that sexually assaulted me while I was asleep came back: (UPDATE)	fourfivedicks	329	61	54	"Hey, guys. A few days I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/149e3n/my_roommates_boyfriend_sexually_assaulted_me/) story. For two weeks, my life has been absolutely normal. Mark and I have been gearing up for finals, and we've been looking at adopting a cat that my friend is getting rid of. Literally, everything is normal as can be.

Last night, Mark had a function at his fraternity or something (not really sure what that means), but when he came in at 2 in the morning, he was completely hammered. He had taken a taxi, so he asked if he could borrow some money for cab fare. I told him I'd take care of it, and I went out to pay the driver. 

On my way out to pay him, I saw a car parked awkwardly in the parking lot right beside my own. I didn't think anything of it at first, until after the cab driver left and I stood there awkwardly, staring at this car. It looked so familiar. I got an eerie feeling, and I went back inside. I bolted the door (with new locks!). I went back to studying, ended up falling asleep in the kitchen (which faces our front door directly). 

At about 4:30-ish, I woke up to a knock on the door. And I was jolted awake. It's the most uncomfortable way to be woken up. My heart was racing, and I looked around to see what time it was. I knew I heard right; there was someone at the fucking door.

I got up, looked out the peephole, and no one was there. I assumed that maybe (just maybe) I had imagined it. (I've been having trouble sleeping the past few days, anyway.) I went to go check on Mark, to make sure he wasn't choking on his own vomit (he was sooo fucking drunk). And then I went to bed.

I woke up a few hours later, checked Facebook to see what my friends thought about their Calculus final exam grades, but then I stopped. I skimmed over Mark's profile, and it showed his recently added friends. And one of them was Chad (I guess he never deleted him?). And Chad's profile picture was of him standing beside the same car I saw last night sitting in the parking lot.

Restraining order was filed today. Apparently Chad was out on bail, but he has a court date very soon. To say that I have been on edge recently is an understatement. I haven't slept. I'm posting this at 3:30 AM. My nerves are shot.

The apartment complex I live in has 24 hour security, but that doesn't make me feel any better, knowing what Chad has done before. And it's horrifying to think that last night, I know someone knocked on my door. There's no other reason. I know I heard it. "	t5_2t3t8	True

This old guy would go into a friends job and pretend to be a massage therapist. He had fake cards made up and would give them to my friend who was 16 (looked younger). He kept trying to get him into his car to go back to his house for a massage. The guy was very creepy and used a fake name, ""Bob Kohler"".

One night a bunch of friends were hanging out and I suggest I prank call this guy. I get on the phone making a baby voice saying i was 7, and found his name on a bathroom wall. He was instantly interested but used creepy phrases like ""How do i know you're legit?"" and ""What do you want me to do to you"". I suggest I leave my house (parents asleep) and meet him at a park near my house. We pile into the car and drive past the park, sure enough we find the guy sitting in his car across the street waiting for the little boy.

After an hour he leaves and we follow him back to his house. It looks straight out of a nightmare. The neighborhood was nice but his house was covered with trees so thick you couldn't see the front door.

We do a reverse search on his address and get his real name. Confirmed child molester. We called the cops but they said they couldn't do anything because he ""didn't actually molest the 7 year old at the park"".

We leave it be for about 5 years then one night drive past his house. It's boarded up and most of the trees are cut down. We asked a jogger about the man who lived there. He said the guy was a creep and a molester and died alone. No family.

Next logical step: we break into the house. 

We go near the steps in the back yard and find hidden steps down. The door is locked from the outside. We unlock it and go in. The basement had old photo developing equipment (or so my friend said). But not much more. We go upstairs and notice the lock is on the outside of the basement door. We continue through the house and we come to the hallway. It was about 8 doors. All locks on the outside. Each closet had scattered toys like army men and dress-up jewelry on the floor.

We go up to the attic, again, lock on the outside. We go in the attic and the wood plank floor looks new. However it doesn't meet flush with the wall. We reach under the floor boards and start pulling out toys, children's clothes, and animal bones. 

We felt like we were going to puke so we left and never looked back. 10 years later and the house still haunts me. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1344841403.0	y4u6k	Do not go upstairs. 	PackinSteel	306	38	38	"I held off on typing this for a while because the idea of thinking about this still scares me to death. Anyway, here we go. 

One late afternoon handful of years ago, my friend invited me over to her place downtown for a get-together. She was leaving work when she invited me so we planned to get at her place at the same time. If I got there early, to let her roommate let me in. 

Turns out, I did get there early. I met her roommate once before, so it wasn't going to be too awkward while it was the two of us. 

She lets me in and just starts going into how she got super creeped out earlier, left her place for a bit, and happened to be home as I pulled up. I asked what she was talking about

""You know our attic upstairs? How there's a railing at the very top where the stairs end? I had to move some stuff out of my room and take it upstairs, so I threw some things in this big box to make one trip. Well the box was really heavy and I'm alone, so I would take breaks""

Her room was downstairs on the first floor and she had two flights to go up. 

""But when I got to the attic, I set the box down to take a quick break. I look up and I swear to god, I saw someone pull their face away from the railing right as we made eye contact. Like someone was looking at me and tried to hide as I glanced at the top of the stairs""

I cut her off and said that we should probably go outside cause that didn't sit too well with me. But she continues to say no, she called out upstairs and no one answered. And like an idiot, she walked upstairs and looked around. She said she didn't find anything, no real signs of entry or anything. 

However, their place is literally about half a foot away from another place. And their windows on the attic level line up with the windows to the other house. There had been come complaints about homeless people squatting at the other home, because it's vacant. She only thought of all of this once I got there. At this point, were both convinced that it was either some homeless person or simply, she was just seeing things. 

Soon after, my friend shows up from work and we give her the lowdown. She's a little shaken up about it, but we all looked around the place and decided there was no real threat. Especially since I'm super skeptical about things (which probably gets me in trouble, haha), I was bent on telling them she was seeing things and we were fine.  

At the end of the night, I was on my friend's computer in her room, showing her pictures from this vacation I took with my friends. Then we hear something upstairs in the attic. Like a thud. 

She calls out to her roommate and her roommate answers from downstairs and starts to walk upstairs to the bedroom. We tell her we think we heard something upstairs and we waited in silence. Again, a thud. Like someone walked into something. 

It's hard to put into words what I actually thought. I didn't take it as a threat or feel any real danger, just that I was convinced it was something else. Like, ""oh the house is old"" or ""even if something was really going on, there's three of us"". Looking back, as I type this, that was all probably a defense mechanism because I was so afraid of it actually being SOMEthing. 

But the three of us, never having to face something like this, were trying to decide what to do. Do we call the police? Do we wait and see what is going on? Do we just run outside? I said that I would take a closer look. I wasn't going to go upstairs, but I was going to  walk upstairs to the door and try to listen for something else. 

But right then, we all heard the same thing. That third floor door open and someone walk downstairs a few steps. Then stops. I am not making this up, this is what I heard. 

In an instant, we run to the door and slam it shut. The house is older, so there aren't any locks on bedroom doors. Just the bathroom and the front/back doors. I am completely freaking out at this point, even if we outnumber whoever just walked downstairs. The amount of pressure I put on the doorknob and the door itself was at some superhero level. I felt like I was going to faint for how scared I was. 

It's quiet for a moment and the doorknob begins to turn and I can feel some pressure from the door pushing on me. Someone is trying to get in. 

It gets quiet again and suddenly, the door shoots back. The amount of force almost knocked me off balance. Right then, the door is banging against my shoulder. Now this person is trying to force their way in by throwing body checks at the door. 

As you can imagine, there was lots of screaming on our end. I couldn't tell you if this person was yelling anything but this is all just one hysteric moment in my memory; it's hazy. I just knew I wasn't letting this door open at all. But it continued to jump open a few inches and slam back shut. 

Then as quickly as it began, it stopped. We heard footsteps run back upstairs and that was it. It was over. 

I held the door shut as my one friend called the police. What seemed like an eternity, the police arrived to the place and I still kept my shoulder pressed on that door just in case. 

My friend opened the bedroom door and raced downstairs to greet the officers and I kept the door shut again. They made their way upstairs and we showed them around. They checked the attic out and didn't find anything but also mentioned the possibility of someone coming in through the window from the other house, because they too knew of homeless people squatting next door. They checked around the property next door and didn't find much.

My friends and left the house that night and they broke their lease immediately, moving someplace else.

1339098305.0	uqa76	The day a crazy man took my baby	notthemamarastamama	309	40	55	"This happened last winter, December of 2011. They say the scariest of scary stories are those that involve real people, not the paranormal. After this, I have to say I agree. Here's my recollection of the most terrifying experience of my life.

My husband was sleeping his way back to good health in the hospital after a nasty infection. The man never went to the doctor, and I practically had to force him to go to the hospital when his fever hit 105. I was worried. They admitted him and he stayed for a week. The day before he was supposed to be sent home was a Sunday, and while my workplace was closed, I had to catch up on year-end reports. It wasn't unusual for me to come in on days we were closed- my coworker Lolo would be there, which meant I could bring my daughter. Lolo was childless, though she had tried for many years before her husband passed away to concieve. She was in this particular Sunday to work on the company newsletter, and as it was a rather simple project, she often asked to play with my daughter Via when I brought her in.

The day started off normal. As I crunched the numbers and prepared my reports, Lolo and Via sat on the other side of the office room coloring. It made me happy to watch them. Lolo got so much enjoyment from being around a child, and Via loved the attention. It was a win-win. When she asked if she could take the little lady for a walk around the dealership, I said sure. What could it hurt? We were the only ones in the building, and Via loved to look at all the cars.
A half hour passed. I thought it was odd that they were gone so long, so I took a peek out of the cashier's window to see if they were in the waiting room. They weren't, but as I turned to go back to my desk, I noticed Lolo's shoes, she looked like she was lying face down, still, in the hallway. My heart raced as I ran out to see what happened.
Via was nowhere in sight. I flipped open my phone and dialed 911, and ran down the hall to the Service area to try and find my daughter. I hardly responded to the operator, I was so frantic. She said they would send someone and told me to stay put, but I couldn't. My daughter was gone, Lolo had been knocked out. Something was wrong with this picture, and by the time they got there, it could be worse. I dropped the phone when I heard a tiny, tiny scream in the distance. It was coming from the Parts department, an area of the building that remains locked when business is closed. The only way in is with a key, so whoever had her was a coworker.

I ran to the door and shoved it. It was locked. I saw her standing in an aisle, a tall figure behind her, and when she saw me, she tried to run to the door. He grabbed her and ran to the back of the room, out of sight. I was about to lose it when I saw the propane tank nestled behind a display to my right.

I grabbed it and threw it through the glass. It shattered and I unlocked the door and raced in. I heard her cries from the upstairs stock room and headed up stairs as fast as I could go. As I ran, I heard the door bust in downstairs- the police were here, finally. I yelled to give them my location, rounded the corner to the stock room, peering down the aisles trying to find her. Aisle 1- nowhere in sight. Aisle 2, nowhere in sight. What I saw in aisle 3 chilled me to the bone.
The owner's son, a known “garbage can” style addict who used to be a salesman, had my daughter at the end of the aisle. He was tying her up with electrical wire. She tried to run to me and fell. He tried to run back down the stairs, but as he hit the middle of the steps, he was blocked off by police officers.

Via was fine physically. We've been taking her to a child therapist to work through the trauma. I'm just glad she's too young for this to really form into a memory. As for the crazy man who took her, he had been living upstairs, apparently no one took his key when he was fired 6 months previous. He never provided an explanation. The owner paid a large amount of money to keep this out of the news. As for Lolo, she recovered and never came back to work, though we remained in touch."	t5_2t3t8	True
1373765271.0	1i90k9	Here's the story of my mom's ex boyfriend. (X-Post from r/nosleep, someone suggested I post it here)	hollyyy95	301	33	40	"Background: My mom dated a guy, Will, when my older sister and I were much younger (I was about 3 and my sister was about 9). They had been dating for a couple years until she figured out he had been doing hard drugs, so she broke off the relationship. He didn't take this too well and started stalking her, which leads us to the story I'm about to tell.




In the beginning it wasn't that bad. She would ""coincidentally"" run into him places, as well as receive numerous phone calls each week asking for her to go back to him. Each time she said no because he still was not sober.




This frustrated him, and soon things got worse. My mom soon received threats from him, and no longer felt safe with the three of us in our apartment. Because of him, I began to stay with my dad a lot more (I didn't normally stay with my dad because of his alcoholism), and my mother and sister stayed with my grandmother/grandfather.




As soon as my mom started staying with them, he caught on. Within the first couple of days my mom had woken up to a broken windshield and a rock on the seat. It was never proven but we know he did it. After this fiasco, things started to subside a bit until nothing happened at all. My mother gathered her things as well as my sister and they moved back to the apartment.




Months went by and my mom had heard nothing from Will. I went back to living with my mom and things returned to the way they used to be, except I still would go to stay with my dad on occasion.




One of the nights I stayed with my dad, my sister begged my mom for them to spend the night at my grandma's. At first she said no, but after awhile gave in and packed up their things for the night. While there, my mom's phone number came up on the caller ID. My mom automatically knew that Will was in the apartment.




It took the police no time to get there, seeing as they had been called a few times before regarding Will. When they entered the apartment, all of the lights were off. When they turned them on, they saw him in a chair facing away from them. He got up thinking it was my family members coming home, and gave the police a clear view of the knife in his hand.




Will was hauled off to the police station while some cops searched the apartment. First they discovered a broken window (it was a first floor apartment), which is what he used to get in. Then, in the bedroom, they found that alcohol had been poured all over the bed and shards of glass were everywhere. After that came the most chilling discovery: a lighter on the bedside table.




While Will was in jail, my mom came to pick me up from my dad's house and take me home one night. She came in to get me, took me out to the car, and strapped me into my car seat in the back. She walked around to the front of the car, and as she started to get into the driver's seat she noticed a man in the passenger seat. He cursed at her, and as she ran around to the back to get me, he escaped.
The cops were called, and although my mom had cash and her medications in plain sight, the only thing taken was some of her personal information (her social security card or driver's license or something like that). It was obvious to my mother that this man had been hired by Will while he was locked up.




Because of police apathy, Will was released from incarceration after a short amount of time. My mom had taken out a restraining order on him, but that didn't stop him from contacting her again. Will called her and asked for her back again, and my mom of course said no.




Desperate to be with her, he took drastic measures to get her attention. He figured if maybe he was hurt, she would feel bad for him and take him back. Using that rationale, he grabbed a gun a shot himself in the leg, knowing it wouldn't cause much harm. Little did he know, he shot right into a major vein/artery, so he bled to death right on the spot.




This story always gives me chills when I hear it. My family never even told me about this until I was 12. If my sister hadn't begged to stay with my grandparents out of nowhere, things could be very different for everyone involved.



EDIT: I just realized, it is against the rules to put *""let's call him X""* in a post. I only did this to protect the identities of my family, as I don't want his identity to get out because of his relation to my mother. I changed it"	t5_2t3t8	True
1362641872.0	19u2fm	The Hello Guy	boomable	310	40	59	"This is my first Reddit post ever and not exactly the most exciting encounter, but like many can attest to, it's quite different when actually experiencing it first hand.  Apologies for how rambling this is for such a simple story; I tend to be really long-winded even over the most insignificant things.

    
From the time I was 12 until I was 18, my mom lived in a two-story apartment. I lived with and was raised by my (maternal) grandparents but I spent a great deal of time staying with my mother, so both places were equally home for me. For the entire 6 years that she lived there, my mother received sporadic phone calls from an unknown caller that we both came to call the ""Hello Man"". The reason for this is fairly simple: when he called he would say hello several times in a monotonous voice with a short, evenly timed pause between each utterance. The only time he ever called was when no one happened to be there so each call was recorded on the messaging machine. Each time the call was made from a blocked number or a public place and it goes without saying that it wasn't a voice we recognized (else the person would have eventually been approached about it).

    
The first few times we wrote it off as being a wrong number or a prank. It wasn't exactly threatening in any way and it wasn't even unsettling to us, either. For the entire six years, we would receive these calls. Sometimes weeks or months would pass before we'd find another one of these messages on the answering machine. 

    
After a few years, when we became completely certain that it wasn't someone we knew, we still didn't find any harm in them. Irritating to come home to on a bad day when you were already in a bad mood, but nothing more. It even became a bit of a running joke in the family, weaving into the idle comments that made up our days and small talk between one another. In all the years we received the calls, the messages were always the same and no other contact was made between this person and us.

    
About two years before she eventually moved out (for unrelated reasons), my mother had her number changed (again for unrelated reasons). Several weeks after doing so, a new message from Hello Man was left. The context of the call was the same - ""Hello. Hello.  Hello..."" - but for the first time, the tone and pacing was different. There was barely a pause between each word and he was louder, almost panic-y in the way he spoke.

    
Later that week, a second message was left. This one sounded angry and he said hello just a single time.  For the first time we felt a little threatened by the caller. How had he gotten her new number? You'd think this would be more reason for us to suspect a friend or family member but it only made us more sure that it wasn't. No one we knew would take a prank far enough to make us feel a legitimate threat, no matter how small.

    
The small sense of fear disappeared quickly, however. It was weeks before we received another call and when we did, it was back to the same monotone and slow repetition as before. In fact, after this point, the calls came even more infrequently than before and we all but forgot about the Hello Man in the times between. 

    
At the end of those six years (three years ago now) I was staying with my mom nearly full-time to help her pack up and organize. Due to some various personal issues, she would be putting most of her belongings in storage to stay with us (my grandparents, my siblings, and I) for a short time before finding a new place for herself. On one particular night, when it was just me and my mother spending the night at her now nearly-barren apartment, we received the last call from the Hello Man. An actual call while we were there, not a message left for us to find hours or even just minutes later. At the time, we'd been taking a break and watching a movie, which was just the reason we'd still kept the couch, tv, and dvd player at the apartment.

    
""Hello. Hello. I know you're there this time. Hello."" There was a long pause during which we heard nothing, not even the sound of his breath. Then, just as the answering machine was about to cut off his message, he started quoting a line from the movie that had been said just a few minutes before. The machine beeped and cut him off, but he didn't call back. Needless to say, we called my grandfather to come pick us up because we didn't want to spend the night there any longer. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1333013515.0	rj0vp	Lead Into an Ambush	Redebidet	294	27	28	"When I was about 18 living in a new city, a friend of mine told me about a friend of his who was trying to sell his used laptop. I was looking for a laptop, and the specs seemed good, so as long as it was on the up and up I told him I'd buy it.

The guy told me to meet him in a public place, which was all fine and good. I brought the cash. He showed up in a car full of some sketchy looking people, and told me he didn't have it with him. He said they were dropping him off, and asked if I could take him to pick up the laptop.

It seemed kind of fishy, but I'm a big strong guy and he was a friend of a friend (or so I thought, turns out my friend who set this up barely knew the guy), so I gave the guy a ride to pick it up.

I started getting a bad feeling about the situation. I'm a safe driver, check my mirrors, don't speed, make sure to signal and check my blind spots, all that stuff. Well my glancing at the mirrors made my passenger chirp up and say ""Don't worry about them following us, I just owe them some money, when you buy the laptop from me I'm just going to pay them."" Hmmm, so apparently the car behind us was the one that dropped him off, and full of 5 sketchy looking guys, and the dude who I was supposed to be buying the laptop from was worried about *me* worrying about them following us. Great, red flag city. I had no idea I was being followed until my passenger anxiously piped up.

So the transaction which was supposed to occur in a public place was now being shifted to some private area. I have cash on me. Five sketchy guys are following me and I have one in the car who is way waaaaay too anxious about what's going on. It became extremely obvious they were planning on robbing me. I wasn't freaked out, it was just like ""Oh shit, so this is what's going down.""

Sometimes people tell stories like this but they really just over reacted, I can't stress enough that I'm the type of guy who's usually pretty collected, and I don't make up scary situations in my mind. It just became painfully obvious that's what they were doing.

So the area we were driving didn't have many people milling about, I wanted to boot the guy from my car but they had shown they were worried about having our transaction (and robbing me) in ""public"", hence this whole song and dance leading me somewhere secluded, so I realized I needed to get to a more public place, to keep them from acting. If I stopped right there and tried to kick him out he might pull a weapon and try to rob me right then if we're isolated, or maybe he would struggle and give his friends time to get out of their car and rush me while I tried to get him out the door.

I kept following his directions to get to the apartment complex where the laptop was supposed to be so I could ""buy"" it, all the while looking for a spot in public with people around to pull over and kick this guy out, with his goon sketchy-as-fuck buddies tailing my car. I could see them clearly in my rear view mirror, these guys had some hard ass ideas going through their head.

Anyways, we reached the entrance to our destination without coming across a good place to kick the guy out. My time was up and I couldn't fake like I didn't know what was up any more. His friends were right on my ass, so I couldn't stop to kick him out, they could be on me too fast. So I noped it right the fuck out of there. I gunned it pass the entrance, the guy in my car was like ""Whoa you just missed the entrance, you were supposed to turn back there."" I accelerated to get some distance between me and his friends. They accelerated too.

I nailed my brakes to try stop and try to kick the guy out, but they were still right on me, I could see them in my mirrors and you could see the expression on their faces. They knew the jig was up, and you could tell they were trying to decide what to do. My idea was to kick him out right there, but for the guys behind me you could see gears turning in their head and that they were going to jump out of their car and rush.

In the moment of their indecision, I gunned it and flipped a U-turn. I accelerated really fucking fast to get some distance, and my passenger said ""Whoa whoa whoa! What are you doing man? The apartments back there!""

I got a few hundred yards distance from his friends before they could flip their car around and follow. I braked hard and pulled over, and in the most intimidating voice and mannerism I could muster I yelled ""**I KNOW WHAT THE FUCKS UP GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY CAR!!**""

Even if someone is planning on robbing you one minute, if you show a terrifying demeanor they will reconsider really fast. You could see the decision mulling in his head. He has a big intimidating dude straight up yelling at him to get out of the car, but instead of jumping out of there like a normal person not up to no good, he sat there a moment considering what he should do. He looked at me like he was sizing me up, he looked back to see if his friends are right behind us to give him a hand, but they aren't, and he knows I'm serious and can't BS for 20 seconds for them to get there. Shit is going to get real really fast if he doesn't move.

He kind of gave me a knowing smirk, kind of saying in a way ""Hey it was worth a try"" and got out of my car. I gassed it out of there right as his friends pulled up. I saw them in the mirror and they were pissed. They were worked up and yelling at each other and motioning towards me, clearly in a ""Get HIM"" fashion. My ex-passenger hopped in their car, and they followed for a bit then gave up because I headed right to a very busy and public area-- knowing that they wouldn't try something in a crowd.

1369858195.0	1fafvs	Jacob	crazecl1p	303	33	33	"This happened about 2 years ago. I was at my mother's house helping with some paperwork and just hanging out. She lived in a Navy housing unit. One of the days I was with her, she mentioned that she had ""Gotten a call from the housing office about someone needing to check our pipes"". I didn't worry because this sort of thing was normal where she lived. 
Fast forward a day. It's around noon and we get a knock on our door. A man in a gray janitor's suit with a patch that said ""Jacob"" was standing at the door. ""Jacob"" carried a clipboard and a toolbox, and he looked pretty legit. 
""Mrs. Anderson"" He said, ""I'm here to check the pipes in your water heater""
We invited him in and he made straight for the laundry room (which was upstairs and hidden from sight).
I thought it a bit strange that he knew were everything was, but I thought it through and came to the assumption that he had worked on many similarly constructed houses in the neighborhood.
He took his tools out, but didn't do much. ""Jacob"" banged around on the pipes for a while and declared everything ship-shape.
My mother and I walked with him out of the house. I noticed that he kept trying to make conversation (presumably to stay in the house).

Soon after he left, a police man came to our door. He said he had received a call about someone entering our home early this morning.
The witness (a good friend of my mother's) said that she was taking out her trash at around 6:00 a.m. and saw a man she didn't recognize entering our home. She had assumed it was just a friend of mine that was staying with me. When she saw the man again in the afternoon, he was trying to get into our back door. She described as ""Tall, wearing a janitor's suit, carrying a toolbox""
It was ""Jacob""
My mother and I gave his description to the police, and they said they would send out a patrol tonight to keep watch.
Nothing happened that night.

Fast forward to midnight the next day. I was getting into bed after watching a movie. I threw my day clothes onto the bed and bent over to get some pajamas out of my suitcase. What I saw horrified me. There were muddy boot prints all around the case. They were disfigured, as if somebody had tried wiping them away. They were still wet.

I was horrified. I grabbed my phone to call the police, when I heard a noise outside the window. There was someone on my roof. Remember the scene in ""Signs"" where Mel Gibson look out the window onto the roof and sees the alien silhouetted against the sky. That's exactly what it was like. I ran into my mother's room and locked the door. She was still asleep, and there were boot prints all around her bed.

By the time the police showed up, the person was gone. I have not had anything like that happen to me since, and I hope I never will.

1369105652.0	1eqosr	"""I can see you"" (long)"	Iwasbeingfollowed	314	45	27	"After coming across this Reddit a few days ago I decided I would add my personal experience. My account is a throwaway and after this I will never speak of it again. I am typing as it comes out so pardon the horrible punctuation/grammar.

I am 25 now and when this happened I was 14 (f) doing online schooling at home. I still had to take certain tests at the high school down the road from me. I lived with my mom and step dad in the northeastern part of Ohio. 

The time came when I had to take a state test and that morning my mom dropped me off at the high school. The night before this I had made arrangements with my real dad to pick me up around noon (when the tests would be over), but I told him if I was not right outside then just come to my moms house because I must have finished early and walked home. 

I finished early, around 11 am and decided I would walk home. At the time I had a relationship with someone who lived out of state and we would each buy phone cards to call long distance... it was my turn to buy one and there was a dollar store on my way home that had cards for cheap. The store I was going to was in a plaza where it was the last remaining business left. The route to my house was all main roads, no side streets etc.

I reach the plaza and have to walk down a hill and past several stores that have went out of business. I see a man (tall, thin, and wearing a camouflage jacket and beanie) fidgeting with a small flag in an old planter in front of one of the empty stores. I thought it was weird, but just kept my head down and approached him (to pass by). When I went to walk past he stopped fidgeting with the flag and looked directly at me. The man didn't say anything so I just went back to looking at the ground and at this point the dollar store was only a few more doors down so I kind of started walking faster. I then hear really loud stomping behind me and I turn around to look and he is following, so then I was basically jogging to the store. I was scared, but some part of me  said he is not really following me and he probably is just going to the only store open in the plaza. 

Once I am in the store I keep looking for him while I head to where the long distance phone cards are. Now I am just standing there pretending to get what I need yet I am basically scanning my surroundings. I see him now, he is behind a display looking at me. I decided to walk around the store to see if he would follow, he did. I grabbed my phone card and went to the register (he was behind a display still watching me) and I don't know why, but I felt stupid for saying anything to the cashier. I talked myself into saying something once it was my turn in line. I told the cashier that I think that man is following me and I don't know what to do, she looks back to who I am pointing at (he is now looking at a book) and says ""I don't think he is, people wait for the bus here all the time and it is probably your imagination."" I felt stupid, paranoid, and uneasy, I just stood there with her looking at me... I really didn't want to leave the store. Finally after three minutes of getting looked at like I was insane I left. 

Once I am out of the store I start walking fast through the rest of the plaza. I feel relieved that he was not following me anymore. In a couple more steps I hear the bell on the dollar stores door, I turn around and it is him. I start running, I keep looking back and he was still walking. I finally get to the other end of the plaza and to the road leading to my house, I look back again and he is now running full speed. 

I have to cross and follow the road to get home so I run across the street when I see no cars and I am just running as fast I can run. It is a busy road, I thought someone would notice this man chasing me and stop to help. He was on the opposite side still just a bit behind me. Tons of cars are passing by and no one helps. I am focused on making it home. 

I did have some luck that day. My house key was never on a key chain, just a single key thrown into a large messenger bag stuffed with junk. I luckily found the key as soon as I stuck my hand into the bag (normally it would take me some time to locate it). I was running as fast as I could and the bag was bouncing against my side, so the odds of that working out as well as it did was rare. 

I now see my house and I am not looking back, I run up the stairs to the back door, open it with my key slam it closed and lock the thing. I then went to hide, I thought there was a possibility he didn't see what house I went into. As I am hiding behind the recliner I hear footsteps coming up the back stairs and then I hear tapping. I am hysterical at this point and not even thinking straight, I look around the corner to see him standing at the back door. I see hear tapping and then all of a sudden he starts pounding against the glass pretty hard. I was frozen just looking and then he presses his face against the glass and starts repeating in the sweetest voice ""I can see you, I can see you."" 

I was crying and telling him to leave, the only phone we had was one with a cord in the kitchen right beside the door his face was pressed against. I didn't want to move from where I was ( I was thinking maybe I should run through the front door and then thought he would catch me before I made it somewhere else). All of a sudden he runs down the steps and I can't see him and I think he is leaving, I was so happy, but as soon as that thought crossed my mind I hear something coming from the basement. The first few times that I heard it I didn't realize that he was kicking in the basement window. So what happened next was fast, I projectile vomited across the room and laid on the floor (yeah, not the best reaction). I then lay on the floor and give up, I feel fucked. 

As I am laying there screaming I hear beating on the door again and I look up to see my dad (it took me a few moments to realize it was him). I ran to the door (still screaming) and opened it to my dad saying ""WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING, I JUST CHASED A GUY OFF KICKING IN THE BASEMENT WINDOW."" I just grabbed him and he grabbed me and I didn't move for a few minutes until my dad made a call to the police and to my mom who was at work. I filed a report with the cops who came out and got a description of the man. They did mention that there was someone who fit the description who they were already looking for, but would not tell us why. I never heard anything back from them anyway.

Six months later, I fell asleep on the couch downstairs. When I am awake in the same spot I see through the kitchen to the back door which has a light on outside on the porch. I wake up every couple minutes (thinking I am dreaming) to something, I don't know what. When I finally open my eyes all the way, I see the guy tapping on my back door, same eyes looking right at me, I hauled ass up the steps ran into my mom and step dads room and jumped on top of them both while they were asleep to go get him. He was gone by the time they realized what was happening and went down there. 

After all of this my sister was visiting and up late on the computer downstairs and seen someone looking in the window (who fit the guys description). Several times after that someone tried to bust open our windows which my mom eventually screwed permanently closed. After a while we moved, I never seen him again and now I live 500 miles from that place. I have a lot of problems from this still... I won't go anywhere alone (unless to work) I know I need to get over it, but it is hard. I thought being 14 I was too old for anyone to ""kidnap"" and it was also during the middle of the day in a busy area, I assumed I was safe. I lie to my family now to make it sound like I go out here doing exciting things and the truth is I don't really leave the house unless I am with my friends or boyfriend. 

tldr: Man chased me home from school and almost got into my house.

1355576262.0	14w5mv	Still scared, sick, and shaky.	duckspunk	313	43	38	"This just happened a few hours ago, and I'm still feeling kinda sick and shaky because I haven't slept at all. At least the sun is coming up and I feel a little safer leaving my bedroom.

My husband is out of town this weekend, and last night I stayed up a little later than usual just watching TV and wrapping Christmas presents. I got to bed around midnight and didn't sleep well. Around three a.m. I was woken by a loud, fast knocking sound, like BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG. But I tend to have really vivid dreams, so even though I woke up and my heart was racing I didn't realize the sound was real at first. Then I heard it again - BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG. I know what it *sounded* like to me  - it sounded like someone was trying to break down my front door using only their fist. But I got out of bed anyway. Usually when this sort of thing happens it turns out my cat is stuck in a cupboard or something, so I thought I'd be able to stop the sound and relieve my fear if I did a little investigating. 

Not this time. I got halfway down the stairs when I saw him. Well, not him exactly - but his shadow. I froze. He was lingering outside one of the front windows, trying to peek in. Then the shadow vanishes, and he knocks again. BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG. I had my cell phone with me, and I called the police. A woman answered the phone and I explained what was happening, that I was scared.

While we were talking he knocked again - BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG - loud enough for the dispatcher to hear it over the phone.

""Oh my god, was that him?"" she said.

She sent a cop by. He pulled into my driveway with his lights on, I guess so I'd be able to recognize he was there before I opened the door. He said by the time he got here there was no one there; there wasn't much he could do besides drive by a few more times during his shift, make sure everything's okay. They're going to send someone by this morning too to check on me (because it's a small town and I guess there's not a lot to do besides write traffic tickets).

I feel physically ill. I really wish I had a dog."	t5_2t3t8	True
1355156467.0	14lxwy	Stranded in an airport while traveling alone	turquoisebackpack	308	37	45	"Hi guys! I’m a 20-year-old female, and this took place back in March. I was 19 years old at the time. It was the end of Spring Break, and I was returning to Texas from California. I had just spent my vacation with my sister who lives in San Francisco. Every college kid counts down the days until spring break, and my vacation had gone rather well. However, I was slightly okay with returning to the essays and research papers, because I missed my friends, my bed, and my cat (maybe not in that particular order).

I was flying alone, something I don’t like doing for multiple reasons, and had only one layover in Dallas. I don’t like traveling alone because I’ve had some bad experiences, and I happen to look a lot younger than 20. Most often, people say I look 13 or 14 at the most. I’ve always hated this about myself, but I’m told I’ll be grateful when I’m older. As of now, it’s just immensely frustrating. The last time I was on a plane by myself, the attendant thought I was an unaccompanied minor named “Taylor.” I quickly assured her I was not the minor in question. The time before that, I was asked to move away from the emergency exit, because “you have to be at least sixteen to sit there.”

Anyways, my boyfriend was picking me up from the airport, and I was excited. I wore the pink Members Only jacket he had bought for me, and tried to look my best (which is difficult to do when traveling). When the plane arrived in Dallas, we had some really terrible weather and the turbulence was scary, but no matter, soon I would be on another flight to Houston. I took the train around to the C terminal, and made my way to my gate only to find that, due to torrential rain and lightening, my flight had been cancelled. I was crushed, but determined, so I took my ticket to be exchanged for a later flight. It seemed many others had the same grievance, and were opting to do the same. As I was standing in line, a friendly looking older man came up to stand behind me.

“Are you alone?” he asked me. Everyone seemed to be conversing with one another, complaining about the weather and pondering their options to get home. It didn’t seem like a big deal, because strangers always seem to connect in situations like this one. We were all frustrated. I also felt safe in the crowded airport, so I answered him truthfully and continued to wait in the line. The man behind the counter said I was in luck, that there were only two seats left on another flight to Houston, and that I could make it if I hurried.
I rushed to board the train to the A terminal to catch my new flight, and upon reaching the gate, was faced with the same situation. This new flight was cancelled too. The man from before had followed me to the gate, and was in the same boat. I exchanged my ticket for a later flight, and resolutely marched myself to the new gate only to be told the same as before. This happened, literally, two or three more times (because I didn’t want to give up and really had no other options). The man shadowed me during the entire ordeal, and I didn’t really find it strange. We were just two individuals stranded in an airport.

The last gate I went to, I noticed he was still following me. He walks over to me and begins to chat about what awful luck we are having. Someone eavesdropping nearby suggests that I rent a car. I politely tell them that I am not old enough. The man smiles and says to me, “Well I’m old enough to rent a car. How about this, I’ll rent us one? You can sleep and I’ll drive.” I look at him, and the way he is staring at me scares me. I finally begin to feel that something is off. I respond, “Uh, no, but thank you. I’m going pretty far.” His smile falters for a moment, then he suggests that he buy me some food. I am starving. I am tempted. I hesitate for a moment, but then I remember a book I had read about a girl who is stolen from the airport after a man drugs her coffee. This gives me the strength to deny my grumbling stomach, and decline him again.

He follows me. I don’t know why, he’s already told me he is going to rent a car. And leave. He points to a Mexican restaurant and says, “Ooh, how about this place?” He has this strange look on his face and is standing far too close to me. I shake my head and say, “I told you, I’m really not hungry.” Lie. Big lie. I can smell something delicious, and I almost give in. But my face does not betray my hunger and I keep my pace.

“Okay okay, what about burgers then?” He looks a bit annoyed. This guy does not give up easy. I ignore him. This causes him to glare at me angrily, and then stalk away. I breathe a sigh of relief. I call my sister to tell her about him, not in a catty sort of way, just a, ‘Wow, that guy was persistent’ kind of thing.
I settle into a chair to think about my options. I feel pretty alone and worried. My latest ticket has me leaving around midnight, and it was about 9 p.m. at that point. I had been in the airport since 5 p.m. If this last flight didn’t work out, I had no clue what I would do. I had no money for a hotel, and didn’t fancy sleeping in a chair. The last time I fell asleep in public (on a train in France) a lady attempted to steal my backpack (but that’s another story).

I look up about 30 minutes later to see the same man walking towards me. I tuck my legs up in my chair nervously, and pretend to play on my phone.

“Hey there. Still here?” he asks. He seems to have cooled down. I just stare at him. He clears his throat and tries again. “So I was thinking, you should come stay at my Aunt’s house with me for the night. That’s where I am staying tonight. It would be no problem. You don’t want to be in this airport all night, all alone.”

I shake my head, and say, “No, I’m fine.” Then turn my attention back to my phone. I didn’t even make eye contact. I felt really uncomfortable. He tries to convince me, and I have to say “no” firmly several more times. He looks angry. Really angry. His hands are clenched and his smile is obviously fake. It looks as if he will shatter his teeth if he clenches his jaw any tighter. I wonder to myself why he hasn’t left the airport yet. Then I notice that his luggage is no longer with him. He was rolling it behind him, and now he isn’t. Where would he have put it if he hadn’t left yet? And so much time has passed, why is he back here? As I’m thinking all of this he is just standing there. Staring.

After what feels like forever he storms off again. I feel so anxious because of him that I grab my things and move to a different gate to wait. My phone was dying, and I didn’t want to be without it, so to charge it I had to plug it into the outlet in the floor. I curled up in the isle between the chairs to wait. My sister called about an hour later, and I was talking to her telling her how creepy the dark weather outside looked, when I see him. Again. Walking around, glancing here and there, in search of me. I hunched down even farther, but my pink jacket was like a beacon. He locked eyes with me, and I looked down. My sister said to stay on the phone, so I did.

“Well there you are.” He says, not even acknowledging that I am in the middle of a phone call. I continue talking to my sister. When it becomes apparent that he isn’t leaving, and doesn’t care that I’m on the phone, I finally look up.  “So you are still here. Look, you need to come with me. You can stay with me at my grandparents tonight, they would love to have you! They won’t mind me bringing you at all. Just come with me.”

I got chills. I don’t know why, but something in his eyes told me he was lying. Lying through those shiny white teeth of his.

“You said you were staying with your aunt.”

His face dropped. It went from cool and collected to something else. Not even anger this time, and not defeat either. Almost like amusement. Something like the cat that ate the canary. He shrugs his shoulders like, ‘I tried.’ But we both recognized that he was caught in his lie.
The entire time my sister is saying, “Hello?” repeatedly, but I was sort of shocked by how indifferent he was to me catching on to him.

I go back to my conversation and he says, “If you change your mind…” and lets the thought trail off while walking away backwards, eyes still on me.

I call my boyfriend and tell him about each exchange, and he tells me to find a security guard to tell. I look around for one, but couldn’t find one. It was creepy because I’ve never seen an airport so deserted. I end up just deciding to move again, and lay down between two different isles, out of view. A boy my age walks by and asks, “Why are you laying on the floor?” and I respond a tad aggressively with, “Because I want to.” He laughs, and puts his hands up, the unspoken sign for ‘Woah, take it easy.’ I apologize for my gruffness and tell him that a man was making me nervous. He jokingly says he’ll protect me, and because he seems harmless and I mention my boyfriend, I converse with him for a while. He tells me he saw me and wondered why ‘the blonde girl looked so sad.’ 

A little while later, I am thankful I did not brush off this stranger because I see the man again walking around. We made eye contact, but he did not attempt to approach me because I was no longer alone.
Maybe he was just some middle-aged man trying his luck at getting a girlfriend or something, but scaring someone isn’t the way to do it. Even if he meant me absolutely no harm, he was too aggressive and angry.
Thanks for reading, sorry for the length.
 
TLDR; Creepy older man suggests I leave airport with him, and becomes angry when I refuse him.

Gender: female

Sorry This is so long, but I figured if the details are going to be so well burned into my brain I might as well type them out.

I had been home alone, and decided to take a walk over to turkey hill (about a mile away) mostly for the heck of it. At the time I walked about 5 miles a day, between going to classes, work, or just walking for fun. This particular route I walked almost daily, but always with my fellow (male) roommate.

It was 6:30PM when I left my apartment, and still bright out (due to it being summer). I walked along the side of the road, enjoying the sunshine, texting away on my phone, as my generation often does, when a big, bright red ford explorer pulls up next to me at around 6:35PM--I know because my phone was out. ""Hey hun, you want a ride?"" no, I did not want a ride. ""Are you sure? I can take you anywhere you want to go."" Yes, I was quite sure. All the while I tried to stay fairly cheerful. I tend to hope for the best in people, and it wasn't uncommon for men in cars to beep at me, or slow down to shout harmless compliments (as boys in college towns often do) but this encounter was different from the rest.

For starters, he was not a boy. This was a man in his mid-40s and his face will be forever seared in my brain. He was chubby, white, and about 5""10"" with short brown hair. Clean. He was wearing a navy blue polo, sunglasses, and a smile. He looked just like any suburban dad you might meet. For all I know he is one.

After my polite refusal, the man drove slowly next to me for a few moments before driving away. I took my first real breath and shook my head for being worried. I checked my phone for a moment, and when I looked up, that same cherry red explorer made a sudden and illegal U-turn in the middle of a three-way intersection not far from where I was. The car came at me with alarming speed, and stopped hastily just a few feet from where I stood, paralyzed with fear and confusion. He opened his car door and stepped out, still smiling that suburban smile, looking right at me. My mouth was dry. I still couldn’t fully process what was going on. Was he lost? Did his car break down? “Are you okay?” Even to my own ears my voice sounded meek. He did not speak. He just continued moving, continued smiling that smile, and walked slowly towards me. It’s hard to explain why this slow walk was so terrifying, and why that specifically haunted my dreams for so many nights to come. He seemed almost… like a lion about to pounce on his prey. It was in this moment I became aware that everything was not okay.

I screamed as loud as one can when fear is choking them and I ran. I bolted on to the grass, in the direction of a house maybe 10 yards away. In moments I felt my attacker’s hands around my waist, pulling me in the direction of his car. As we struggle I am acutely aware of the steady progress we are making in the direction of his vehicle. It became very real for me. That I might end up one of those people on the news.  All I could think was “No”—so much so that I began angrily saying it. I threw myself to the ground in the opposite direction of the car, and as he comes down with me I somehow end up on my back. My first thought is of the pepper spray I usually keep in my purse front pocket, and I delve my hand inside—which is difficult as he is utilizing the time my hands are preoccupied to beat my face. I realize the spray isn’t there and my heart sinks. He has my legs mostly pinned, and I’m thrashing for all I’m worth. I start to feel his hands moving underneath my dress, pulling it up, grabbing my ass, and I notice he’s not trying to move me to the car anymore. I can feel his body pressing heavier against me. Fear flashes through me as I realize where this is going. My nails find his face of their own accord, and his sunglasses are shifted slightly up as I go for the eyes. This pushes his face away from me and in the direction of the road—where I found out later several cars had slowed to a crawl to watch the scene unfold. (Apparently this is when he noticed the crowd he was drawing and decided it best to leave)

As quickly as he had been on me, he was gone. He swaggered back towards his car, looked at me, and smiled before getting in. I leapt up and ran towards him—livid and confused and not willing to let him get away yet unsure how to proceed. I tend to be fairly well spoken, and I’m no stranger to insults, but at the time my outraged mind could only spit out “HEY!” before he sped off.

It’s weird but I didn’t cry until after I found a house and called the police—I had misplaced my phone in the shuffle and didn’t find it until later that night. I found out later that the house it happened in front of had people home, but they elected not to help. When I knocked on their door afterwards they pretended they weren’t home. The only time people started to come forward with their versions of the story was after the police had arrived, in some sick excitement to get their 15 minutes of fame. The man was never caught.

1375985025.0	1jyxpc	"""Are you my mom's friend?""- No.... no she isn't"	Marscy	322	52	29	"So this happened when I was about 9 or 10- probably 9. This isn't relevant, but I'm a girl. I thought nothing of it at the time, and only *really* realized the creepiness a year later. 

For context: My neighborhood back then was pretty safe (it still is) and we had a security alarm, but only left it on at night. I had gotten home from school, and had spent an hour or so on the computer (so it was around 3 or 4 pm) and I was home alone (my dad was at work, my mom and brothers were grocery shopping.) 

The desk that had the laptop was next to an archway which led to the dining room which had a wine rack (which my siblings and I never touched, fearing we'd somehow break the wine bottles) and a wardrobe/cabinet thing which had other alcohol in it (like vodka and sake) which my siblings and I also never touched since we thought alcohol was gross. The cabinet wardrobe thing was right next to the archway closest to the laptop. 

So I was playing on the laptop and glance at the dining room, and notice the wardrobe cabinet door is wide open. I think nothing of it, until I glance at it again, look down and notice a pair of bare feet. The cabinet door closes and a woman is standing there, mid to late twenties, and I distinctly remember her looking pretty and she had red-ish hair. She notices me looking and smiles at me, and stops rummaging through the cabinet. 

I had just gotten a puppy who was very fluffy and adorable- and social. When she stopped, I notice she's holding my puppy, saying how cute he is and how she wishes she had a dog. I agree with her, and then I ask: ""Are you one of my mom's friends?"" because sometimes they babysat my siblings and I. 

She responds no, while cooing over my puppy. There's a silence, and she puts him down and he wanders over to me and lays down. She walks away and I cautiously follow her, and notice at the steps of the door she was using to leave were several bottles of different alcoholic drinks. I thought that was weird, but since I rarely went into the cabinet, I didn't recognize the bottles as ours. 

I thought that was weird, and went back to playing on the computer. My mom and brothers come back, and my mom asks me how my day was and I tell her about the lady. My mom kind of freezes, trying not to freak out, I think. I didn't tell her the lady took anything because I didn't know that stuff was ours. She asks how she got in, and I tell my mom that I think she got in through our garage door because that's how she left. I mention she had some alcohol bottles with her. My mom (which, to me at the time, was acting weird) tells me with a serious/freaked out look on her face to lock the garage door next time and don't let strangers in, etc. (she knew I didn't let the lady in, but I guess she was freaked out that someone was in her house with her kid)

Later, like a few days, my mom tells me who the lady was. Apparently our next door neighbors had a twenty something year old alcoholic daughter and she came to them asking for alcohol and money, and they said no, so she came into our house to get her fix. 

A year or so later, when someone was asking me about my dog, I suddenly thought about that and got freaked out about how easily she could have taken him from me. 

Tl;dr: Lady walks into my house while it's unlocked and I'm home alone and 9 years old, takes some alcoholic drinks from the house, could have also taken  my dog or other valuable stuff. Ask if she's my mom's friend, says no, takes the alcohol, leaves. Turns out she's the neighbor's alcoholic daughter.

Edit: talked to my younger brother about this today, and my mom. Turns out about a year later the woman was arrested for trying to break into her parent's house. Also, after this, if I *had* to be left home alone, my mom would stress locking the doors and not answering the front door, even if I knew who it was (unless it was family)"	t5_2t3t8	True
1366420819.0	1cpq82	Roommate Video Taping Me	oliviabloom	305	36	32	"To clarify:  I'm a female and I was 20 when this occurred.  


When I was a junior in college, I transferred from the local community college to a university a few hours away.  Due to a communication issue with the admissions office, I had a very short amount of time to find living accommodations.  I didn't know anyone in the area, so I looked at Craigslist ads renting out rooms and found a place near my school.  I met up with the guy renting out the room and the house was large, beautiful, and in a very nice neighborhood.  Peter, the man who owned the home, was in his early thirties, worked mostly from home in his bedroom office, and was polite.  Peter also rented a room to another university student that was out of town until the semester began.  The third roommate was very quiet and nice.



For my first week, I was completely alone in the house because Peter had a business trip and the third roommate was not back from his parent's place yet.  The house was a little eerie because it was so large and mostly unfurnished, aside from a lone couch in the living room, a television and our own personal bedroom furniture.  There were two entire bedrooms that were completely empty and a locked, empty upstairs that you could only access from an outdoor staircase directly outside of my bedroom.  The house had several additions, so the lay out was odd.  My bedroom was very spacious and had visible wiring throughout the room and the closet, which had a broken door that was propped to the side.  Peter told me the previous owners used it as an office and the internet wires once ran through my room up into the upstairs.  I checked the wires because it gave me a bad feeling but didn't find anything suspicious, mostly because I had no idea what to look for.



Once Peter returned, I noticed odd things about him.  He would say strange things to me that were oddly sexual but English was not his native language so I didn't know if we just had a language barrier and I was misinterpreting him.  Peter liked to take pictures of me without my consent and post them on Facebook, usually tagging me.  At first the pictures were very mild, such as me sitting on the couch with a friend or me typing on my laptop at the new kitchen table.  He would turn the flash off so I never knew he was taking these pictures until later when I saw them on the internet.  The pictures became more invasive with time; one was of me in a towel when I was walking from my bathroom to my bedroom and another was of me tanning in my backyard at a time I didn't know he was home.



I found Peter strange and uncomfortable, but the room was a steal and I liked the location.  Our third roommate shared a thermostat with me that controlled my bedroom, his bedroom, and the hallway that led to the living room.  The thermostat was located in my bedroom near my closet so I always left the door unlocked for him to change it if needed.  One day Peter was out of town and the third roommate was changing the thermostat and noticed something strange behind one of the wires coiled in the closet.  He called me over to inspect it and it looked like a tiny, shiny black ball.  I was really afraid it was a camera and put a piece of duct tape over the ball.  I considered saying something to Peter but didn't want to accuse him of something I really knew nothing about.  He also wasn't home yet so me and the third roommate decided we would ask him about together when he was home.



Peter returned to town two nights later, on a red eye flight.   I always slept with my door closed, but left it unlocked in case my third roommate needed in.  I woke up the night Peter returned, disoriented, and noticed the door was open with a small rectangle of light spilling in and someone was moving inside my room.  I stayed very still and tried to make out the figure, which was staying near my closet, directly across from my bed. My eyes were having difficulty adjusting to the darkness, but I could clearly see a person slowly moving throughout my bedroom.  The figure left and I turned the light on and inspected my closet to see that the piece of tape was missing and not anywhere on the floor, like it had fallen.  I opened my door and saw Peter walking down the hallway, back to his bedroom.  I quietly followed him, and when he walked into his room I followed him in and demanded to know what the hell he was doing in my bedroom in the middle of the night.



When I confronted Peter, he jumped, obviously surprised I was in his room.  Behind him, on the desktop he was always hunched over doing his work, was a grainy video image of my bedroom, faltering in the dim lamp light I had just turned on.  I could clearly see my bed in the frame.  Although Peter was a creepy man, he wasn't confrontational and he immediately began apologizing and trying to explain it wasn't what it looked like.



I don't have the best closing for this experience.  I contacted the police and immediately moved in with someone I met at school.  I don't want to disclose anything about the investigation because charges were pressed, but this was several years ago so I wanted to finally get this experience off my chest and out of my mind.  I'm not sure how much footage Peter had of me, and if it still exists somewhere on the internet or in an evidence box at the police station.   I'm not even sure when the camera was installed and if he ever had anything worthwhile of taping other than a few nude shots he shared with other people through the internet (I don't know how much and what exactly it was; the police told me that and I didn't want more details).  So little was disclosed to me about exactly what he had and honestly, I hope I never know.

1370808321.0	1fzyne	Sometimes stalkers aren't so bad.	GlassChild	307	39	37	"My father tells me a lot of stories about his old lady friends, but this one really stuck with me for a while. 

He had a lady friend named Mary living in a big city, and Mary was the sort of girl that loved to leave her curtains open, she was fond of natural light and lived high up enough that she wasn't visible from the street below. From what my father told me, she was a beautiful girl that made poor dating decisions and was often attracted to assholes. 

One day Mary had enough with one of her longer term asshole boyfriends, so she broke up with him over the phone. She was really too nervous to do it in person because he was a hot headed and temperamental jerk. Not much later, he was at her door, begging to be heard out, banging at it, and demanding she let him in. For some reason, I guess he sounded pathetic enough for Mary to feel bad, and she opened that door, but when she refused to give him a second chance he flew into a rage, shoved his way inside, grabbed her by the hair and started beating her. There was nothing she could do, he had closed the door but didn't lock it. 

Then something happened that neither of them could have ever expected. About six minutes into her having the life beaten out of her, the door opened, and in stepped this gaunt faced young man. He wrenched the scorned ex off of Mary, and proceeded to give him a taste of his own medicine, holding him by the hair and feeding him fist after fist until finally the ex twisted free and hauled his ass out of there, yelping threats as he retreated off down the hall and stairs. 

Mary had told my dad that the man was pretty tall with lank hair and a strangely emotionless look about him, even after he had fed her ex his own teeth. He was breathing heavy but didn't seem angry. He didn't move to help her up or even touch her, he just stared at her for a moment, like a deer caught in the headlights. She was crying but still managed to thank him and ask him if he had heard her yelling. He shook his head and plainly said ""I can see you in the windows."" And then just as quickly as he came, he left, and she never saw him again.

My dad told me that she didn't bother to make it a habit to close her curtains after that, since it had saved her once. Sometimes people aren't entirely good or bad, a lot of times they are somewhere in the middle."	t5_2t3t8	True
1367213877.0	1dblei	Creep nurse nearly kills me in the middle of the night [Long]	sinenox	311	46	50	"When I was 20 I was hospitalized due to immunodeficiency for multiple infections, including one that had to be surgically excised. A lot of crazy stuff happened during that visit, including being misdiagnosed with AIDS and flesh-eating bacteria (this is at one of the best hospitals in the USA). But this was by far the scariest thing that occurred during my stay.




One night, about 3AM I think, one of the nurses came in. I woke up because I had slept a lot that day, and the bright lights in the hall bothered me. It wasn't my normal male nurse, but an older woman, maybe mid-to-late 40's. I had never seen her before, and she looked very severe. She didn't acknowledge me at all when I greeted her, and asked her questions, just finally said ""time for your medication"" or something like that.


I tried to respect that she didn't want to talk and just faced forward again, also because it hurt to move, but I noticed that she had a much larger volume syringe than usual. My morphine dose was always given in a 10-20cc syringe, but this thing was huge, like a 100-500 cc syring, and the accuracy couldn't be that good, so I turned my head again and asked (trying to sound friendly and interested) what my dosage was and if she was sure she had the right person. She ignored me, and I continued""…because I think maybe normally my dosage is a lot lower, would you mind double-checking..."" She only said ""Go to sleep, this will be over soon"", injected the medication, and left. I was kinda out of it, I was just so used to all of this stuff going on around me that I figured I was mistaken. I tried to go back to sleep but even before the medication hit me I felt like there was something wrong. I thought about kinking the IV line, which would cause the alarm to go off, and forcing the issue, but I just told myself to calm down and try to go back to sleep. They do this for a living, after all, and it was probably just the change of nurse that was bothering me.


So after a time - I don't really know how much time - I start to feel more genuinely, and undeniably weird. First, everything felt hot. Or rather, hot on the outside, like I'm radiating heat from the surface of my skin everywhere, but cold on the inside of my skin. Around then I started to notice that everything had turned a shade of red and it was all pulsing, with what I imagine was my heartbeat. So I'm staring at the ceiling, in the dim, and everything I can see is through this red filter, pulsing slightly. I can feel goose bumps on every inch of my body. Then I can feel nothing, I lose all sensation in my skin. I can still feel pressure, but I can't feel anything else, except intricate ripples across my body as though I'm naked and the window is open and eventually even these fade, but they're a good example of the mental confusion that set in. For example after a while I couldn't tell if my eyes were open or closed, if I was actually seeing or thinking I was seeing. When all sensation finally left me I felt like I was floating about 5"" off of the surface of the bed. 

I realize, as I'm testing my ability to sense things, that I am having a hard time moving. Moving my hand or arm takes a concerted effort. At this point I somehow managed to hit the call button, for which I am later grateful. But nothing feels emergent, the whole thing comes with a warm fuzziness, so I spend a lot of time just playing with trying to move my hands or arms, watching them before realizing I'm not actually looking at them, but nonetheless gradually losing my ability to move anything at all. Around the time I can only barely move my wrists, not my arms or fingers (and my legs are a foreign country) I start to feel concern.
I realize, on some deeper level in the back of my mind, that the feeling I have in the pit of my stomach is clenching concern, and that this actually has the potential to be very dangerous. I want to hit the button again, or even call out, but I am just too tired, my muscles wont move, and now I notice that the pulsing isn't as frequent as it was, though it was only upon reflection later on that I fully realized the significance of that. So I kind of mentally slapped myself and set about consciously focusing on breathing - in and out, in and out, and don't forget in - that's the hard part. 

It felt like the nurses never responded, for I would have guessed that it had been 22-35 minutes at least. But suddenly, as if in slow motion, it seemed like a lot of things happened all at once. There had been this growing tension in me. If I could have flexed every muscle in my body I would have been, I was fighting something very hard. And then my nurse came in - my male nurse, whom I had thought was out for the night. The moment I hear the door open coincides with a sudden release of all of the heavy mass that had settled over me, like a soft heavy blanket that wouldn’t let me move. And I suddenly sat up and projectile vomited in to the bathroom, next to the nurse who was just walking in. (Sorry, I know it’s gross, but basically my body collected it and got rid of it.) After that I could move, I could even speak after a few minutes.


My nurse seemed relieved to say the least. He cleaned it up and sat next to me and talked for a while. He said that another nurse had been trying to help him, and mixed up my dosage, but he didn't seem to want to give much detail. It wasn't until years later that I thought - I was in the terminal ward, I had been out of it for days, clearly in visible pain for some of it, I was the youngest person there by 40 years or so. I wonder if it was just a mistake, or if that woman was an angel of death? Either way, I refused morphine for the rest of my time there and ever since. I wouldn’t accept any of the other pain-killers, either.


TL;DR – Strange nurse shows up in the middle of the night, ignores my protests, gives me a heroin overdose, and vanishes."	t5_2t3t8	True
1375056753.0	1j8t4j	"""I hope you don't find that too forward."""	TillStalkDoUsPart	320	56	58	"I was mindlessly browsing Facebook one day when I received a message to my inbox. Clicking on it, I realize it's from someone who I do not know. His name is Peter, and he sent me this:

""Hi. I was taken back by how beautiful you are in your picture. I hope you don't find that too forward. I saw you post on *insert local companies name here* wall and I thought your comment was funny. I couldn't resist clicking on your profile and messaging you. Your sense of humor is just like mine, and I'd like to thank you for making me laugh today. I just lost my mother a few months ago... and I've had a hard time with it. I can't remember the last time I even smiled...let alone laughed. So thank you."" 

Now, normally, I do not reply to messages from people I don't know, but I felt bad for the guy. I thanked him and told him I was sorry for his loss, and that I was glad that I made him laugh...but once he sent me a friend request I had to let him know I didn't have any intention of adding him as I only use facebook for people I know. He said he understood and we said our good-byes. 

So one day about a week after his initial message I was out shopping at the local grocery store nearby my home and I noticed a guy looking at me from a few feet away in the aisle I was in. I looked and smiled nervously as I'm somewhat shy and socially awkward and he smiled back and then looked at what was in front of him. He looked familiar, but I couldn't put my finger on it. I checked out with my groceries and went home. After putting all my groceries away I sit down and log onto facebook and see I have a message. It was from him...

""I liked the dress you wore today. It fit your body nicely. thanks for smiling at me...made me feel special."" 

I didn't realize it was him at the store, but seeing his picture again on facebook definitely matched the guy in the store. I was sort of sketched out by this...but it could have just been a coincidence.

I chose not to reply just to be safe. About another week goes by and I haven't heard from him again. I was out with some friends at night at a park just hanging out on the swings like we did when we were teenagers when I noticed someone in the distance. They were walking towards the park... my friends and I got kinda spooked and went quiet. I realized when the person was close enough that it was Peter. I tell my friends in a quiet voice ""don't panic...act natural...but we need to leave now. Get in the car."" They didn't argue and we all got in the car and drove away....Peter was gone. 

I told my friends who it was and what had been going on. They told me I was just being paranoid. 

Then I got a message on facebook again...it was from him. 

""So do you go to the park often?"" 

I noped the fuck out....and replied with this: 

""Do not message me ever again. My boyfriend is aware of the situation and he is a police officer. Leave me alone."" 

I blocked him...and even though I made up the boyfriend thing to scare him...it must have worked because I haven't heard from him or seen him again in months. I live with 3 people who all know what he looks like and know about the situation so they keep a look out and nothing suspicious has happened... but...that doesn't mean I don't look over my shoulder every now and then.

One night after getting in from work I decided to take a shower before settling down for the night with a massive bottle of wine and video games with the roommate (who was not home yet, I figured I'd get in the shower before he got home as he had a tendency to take ages).  
Well, I get out and hear general moving about noises coming from my bedroom.  I assume it's my roommate gone in to my room to get a movie or game so I start chatting about how my day was and asking him if he was busy at work today...blah blah.  Then I go into my bedroom in a towel planning to be horrible and tease him a bit ( I was 20, and kinda cute...don't hate me) and see a man standing in my window that had been closed given it was January.  He puts my laptop back down on my desk and says 'Sorry, girl.' and leaves. 
 What?!  Did you seriously just break into my shitty little apartment to steal a two year old laptop?  Then just go?  And I'm supposed to act like nothing's happened?

1342075367.0	wfif1	Just because it's light out doesn't mean you're safe.	morganshea	297	32	27	"This is my first post, so go easy on me. After reading through countless stories, this has quickly become my favorite sub - and I thought I'd give back a little by sharing my own creepy experience. It goes back to June of 2009 on Arizona State University's Tempe campus...

I was 21-years-old, a female broadcast journalism major taking a summer class in TV reporting. Out on an assignment for class, I was shooting b-roll at the ballpark for a story on ASU Baseball and the College World Series. It was around 3 pm. I pulled into the parking lot, which was entirely deserted, and parked my car right next to the curb - as close to the park as I could get. June in Arizona is brutal, heat-wise, so I had every intention of making this process a short one. I left the trunk open and my keys in the ignition with the car on to keep the AC running. The gates to the ballpark were padlocked and chained shut, so I set up my camera and tripod right outside the box office to get set-up footage.

I had been there for about 10 minutes when a silver pick-up pulled into the lot and parked perpendicularly in front of my car, making it difficult for me to leave if I had gotten in my car to drive away. At this point I knew something was going on because, literally, the entire lot was empty and this guy parked about 2 feet away from my car. My assumptions were confirmed in the next few minutes.

The guy got out of his beat up double cab pick-up, leaving his car on with both the front and back doors on the driver's side wide open. He started walking toward me, seeming slightly aggressive. Physically, the guy was about 6'3"" and heavyset with white hair and glasses. Probably in his 50's, he wore a dull yellow baseball cap, a filthy blue shirt and blue sweat pants. Looked like he hadn't showered or changed clothes in weeks. His face was genuinely disturbing. To this day I can't accurately describe the feeling I got from the expression on his face - a twisted semi-grin, but his eyes looked menacing, like he had a screw loose. He walked with intent - with one hand in his pocket as he headed for where I stood, I could feel his eyes burning into me. No exaggeration, I was frozen.

As he approached me, he asked in a hushed tone, ""is ASU playing today?"" He said it slowly, never taking his eyes off me, still moving closer. I'll never forget how that stare felt. I was so scared at that exact moment. I knew he was trying to talk to me in some attempt to distract my attention from what I already knew. I didn't respond, so he asked again. I replied with a quick no, picked up my phone, and answered like I was receiving a call. He just stood there. Still staring.

I spoke loudly to ensure the man heard what I was saying. ""Hey are you almost here? Oh, okay yeah I see you,"" and I waved toward the street behind the man. As I said this, the guy slowly ambled away from me, heading toward the ballpark gates. The entire time, he did not once take his eyes off of me. Not once. He was glaring - it felt like he was angry with me. He looked furious.

I took notice that it was still just he and I in that lot, and his car was parked directly in front of mine so that I would have to reverse in order to drive away. Once he was a reasonable distance away (about 25 feet), eyes still locked on me, I picked up my equipment and ran to my car. He followed. I was frantically attempting to repack my car, throwing my equipment into the trunk without even bothering to shut it. I was literally running back to the driver's side door when he met me there. The guy's car was still on and his doors were still open. He reached out to grab me. At that exact second, I ducked into the driver's seat and without closing the door, threw my car into reverse, slamming on the accelerator. 

I was bawling at this point. I flew out of the parking lot and drove away. I knew I had to call the police, but I wanted to get the guy's license plate number so they could actually do something about what had just happened. I don't know what possessed me to do so, but I went back to the ballpark. As I pulled into the lot, the truck came barreling toward my car. He then followed me.

I drove directly to the campus police station in Tempe - he drove past it. I didn't get his license plate number, but I did fill out a police report. Nothing ever came of it, as far as I know.

Phoenix is the abduction capital of America, and this guy's physical appearance screamed insanity. I will never again feel safe just because it's daytime. I will never again go to a deserted area by myself. Parking lots will creep me out for the rest of my life. And I'm thinking those are all good things.

1376087184.0	1k20ec	The story I never told my wife. And never will.	Jizzanthapuss	310	47	27	"My wife and I just purchased our first home and had our first kid. The house was being built by the builders and we would drive past the house every so often just to look and see how our house was coming along. We started visiting the house at night and noticed a car parked out front of our house. It was strange, but we figured it was probably just one of the workers leaving their car overnight. Sometimes the car was there, sometimes it wasn't... We didn't think too much of it. 
Fast forward a few months and our house is built. The house is empty and we are slowly moving everything in during the first week. As for the mysterious car, it started showing up late at night but not parking directly in front of our house anymore, but about 50 feet away by a nearby park area. Now keep in mind, we are the only house on the block. This was a brand new development and we were literally the first house built, so we were just this lonesome house in the middle of the desert, a few blocks away from the nearest neighborhood. My wife demands we buy a security system, so I do (she spent many nights alone since I worked late at night). 

It's my day off and I spend it organizing stuff from the moving boxes and hanging out with my 6 month old son. My wife is at work. I realize that there are no diapers or wipes, so I call my mother in law and ask her if she could swing by today to drop some off (I didn't have my car that day, so there were no cars in my driveway). I tell her that I will leave the front door unlocked because I will be taking a nap with my son.

A few hours later, my son is fast asleep on our bed and I decide to cuddle up with him and go to sleep myself. I lay down when I hear the door chime of my security alarm for the front door. I know it's my mother in law and I really didn't feel like talking to her, so I figured I would just lay there and pretended to be asleep and hope she wouldn't come upstairs. I hear the footsteps of her coming up the stairs, but she is moving slowly... I thought it was weird but figured she knew we were sleeping and didn't want to wake us. My back is facing the door to my bedroom and I hear her open the door. I get into my ""pretend sleep mode"" and stay still. I hear a quick breath of air, as if she was startled to see us sleeping. No other noise is made and I assume she is just standing there... I think to myself ""Ok... Go away now..."" but it takes a full minute or two before I hear her slowly tip toeing out of my room, downstairs, and then leaving the house. As soon as I hear the door chime, I pop out of bed and walk downstairs to grab the diapers... But they aren't there. I think ""what the fuck?"" she showed up and didn't even leave the diapers... I run over to the front window and she's gone. 

During this whole event, my phone was off and charging, so I turn it on to see that I have a new voice mail. It's from my mother in law. 

""Sorry honey, I am not able to come over and bring those diapers, I got caught up in other plans. Have a nice nap!""

I got off at the rear of the train as it stopped. A woman in her 20's got off at the front. She was dressed up like she'd been out for dinner or something. Blonde hair in a ponytail. Black dress. Heels. We both left the platform and headed down the same street. 

I was pretty tired and mostly watching my feet as I walked, but one time I looked up and she was watching me over her shoulder with a worried look on her face.

I could tell she had that ""I'm being followed"" feeling, so I slowed down and let her put some distance between us. I'm a big dude. 6'1"", over 100kg, so I'm aware I could look scary on a dark street.

I wasn't paying much attention to her after that, but when I turned into my street, there she was ahead of me.

The shit hit the fan when she looked over her shoulder and saw me. She let out a loud yelp and started sprinting away *in heels*. I could still hear them clicking on the footpath as I turned the key in my front door. 

I hope she was relieved the next time she looked back and I was gone.

At first it was joking around and small talk, English wasn't his first language and I don't know much Spanish so we didn't talk a whole lot. 
Then he started asking to hang out outside of work, and I declined, I had a boyfriend at the time. But week after week he would ask and pester and start demanding explanations about why I wouldn't just hang out, it starting getting creepy to me. 
During this time my mother was murdered (unrelated, but messed up my head making this situation worse) and I moved into an apartment with some friends and broke up with my boyfriend. 
We would throw parties at our place and a lot of the restaurant staff would show up, and so the creeper guy would escalate his demands and threats at work wanting to spend time with me, by now I was so freaked, nothing I would say would get him to leave me alone. 
By now, I had met a new guy and we were walking down a busy street and creeper guy would just keep cruising around the blocks so he could scream and yell at me. New boyfriend worked at the same place as me and creeper so he talked to kitchen manager and they agreed to keep an eye on this guy. 
The following weekend we throw a party at my apartment, late into the night, creeper shows up. Our place is packed so I don't really notice him, but he was following me. 
I went to the bathroom, and as I was opening the door to go out he shoves it open, grabs my mouth and starts shutting the door. It happened so fast, I was starting to struggle, and scream. 
One of my roommates thankfully saw him push his way in and busted in the door and dragged the creeper through the house out the back door into the alley and my coworkers gave him a proper beat down. 
Needless to say, he was fired and I never saw him again. It was the most helpless and out of control feeling and it took awhile to get over.

1330202870.0	q5tro	[MY] Female Dorm Intruder	BurgWorks	294	36	32	"It was the fall semester of my second year of college. No longer a freshman I felt I had a pretty strong grasp on campus life. A female friend of mine (who I admit I had always found attractive) from high school had just started, was living in the dorms, and often required my services as an experienced sophomore coed.

One evening she asked if I wanted to come over to watch a movie on  her crappy 12in TV. Knowing it meant being cuddly on a bed, the only seating for two in the cramp dorm room, I excepted her offer. 

The movie had ended and curfew was quickly approaching. Due to the dorms policies on boys after 11, I began to put on my shoes in preparation for my departure. Thats when she grabbed my shoulder. I instantly saw the look of worry in her eyes, and then realized she had seemed off all night long. She finally confided me in.

""Over the past two nights, someone, some guy knocks on my door. He does it so soft that when I finally wake up, Im not really sure how long he's been there. And he talks. Repeats. Keeps asking if Im sleeping and if he can come in. So far Ive said nothing. I just lie here with the blankets up to my chin. This goes one for about an hour and then he just stops, and is gone. I finally asked my neighbors today if they had heard any thing or had a similar experience. They said no.""

Now this is college. I wasn't too worried. There could be any number of explanations. Most likely a prank, maybe even perpetrated by her supposed unknowing neighbors. The dorm was pretty secure, the hallway lights always on, and exterior doors locked after 11. It had to be a prank, but to console my upset friend, I agreed to stay the night incase the events were to reoccur. 

Much to my dismay, I slept on the floor, but I did sleep. Honestly I wasn't super concerned. If this did happen again, I'd just cowboy up, tell the guy off, then hopefully spend the rest of the night next to a grateful warm body beneath neon purple bed sheets.

I was in deep sleep when a slight tap on my shoulder abruptly awoke me. It took a moment to remember were I was and regain my equilibrium, but shortly after doing so, I heard the knocking. But it was really more of a tapping. Very soft, almost gentle. It paused after about every four or five beats. The only light in the room was the light coming from under the door in the hallway with the exception the two shadows made by the individuals feet.

I looked to my friend not sure how long she had been awake. As her face came in focus I began to register her terror. That was the first time this whole thing had actually started to get to me. Then, in my moment of vulnerability,  I heard the voice. I quickly shot my attention back to the door.

""Are you sleeping sweetly? Sweetly are you sleeping? Can I come in? Let me in.""

A cold shot up my spine. His voice was soft yet rough, it didn't sound like that of some young student. While talking he didn't even pause in his rhythmic tap. The taps just kept going, over his words, almost muffling them. I quietly stood up, and slowly approached the door.I stopped at it to get a better listen. He kept repeating a variation of the same words, sleeping and sweetly, sometimes even mixing up parts of the words like, ""Are you sweeping sleetly"". This slurred dialect lead me to believe that perhaps this was a drunk, who somehow consecutively stumbled his way into the dorm, and harassed my friend. After he finished asking for entry once more, I took down a warm gulp of air, and finally spoke up.
""Hey Guy, you got the wrong place, why don't you get lost."" The tapping abruptly stopped. There were no words. I instantly wish I had thought of something cooler to say but it seemed to do the trick. I looked down to the floor, the shadows of his feet still remained. It was probably only a few seconds but it seemed like a lot longer. Then, one by one the shadows disappeared as he walked away. 

I let out a sigh of relief then looked back to my friend. Seeing that grateful smile and teary eyes made me feel like a badass. It apparently made me walk like a badass too as I noticed I had a bit of a strut as I walked back to her side. As I prepared to return to the floor, she scooted against the wall and pulled open the sheets beside her. I looked at the open spot of mattress, then back to her. She gave a cutesy smile and a reassuring nod. I comically jumped in like a kid at the pool on the first day of summer. We both laughed then nestled in closer. Then the tapping returned.

I popped up with a mixed fuel of fear and anger. The shadows had also returned. This jerk just made me go from badass to punkass in less then two minutes. I jumped up rushing the door shouting as I stomped ""Hey man, I told you to get the hell out of here!"" I stopped at the door hand on knob. No response from the other side. I would have killed for a for one of those hotel peep hole things but was honestly to afraid to crack the door open. 

After a beat, a voice spoke up. ""This is the R.A. Boys are not aloud on the premisses over night. For the safety of the other girls you have to leave or I'll report your friend."" 

My friend let out a ""Crap!"" then jumped up to answer the door. She put on a pair of pajama pants that were under the covers. I grit my teeth in disappointment realizing she had at some point in the ordeal slipped them off. She ran up beside me then opened the door.

""Sorry."" She said to the R.A., then begin to explain, ""You see, there was this guy who…"" The R.A. interrupted her. ""Under no circumstances should a boy stay over night in the dorm. Nor should you sit helplessly in a dangerous situation. Were  someone to actually come to your or any other girls door at night, you should dial 4 on your phone for campus security, or repot the incident to me. You've been the only one we had to visit multiple times. Now get that guy out of here.""

It turns out the whole thing was some R.A.s idea of teaching the girls a valuable lesson, and in fact half the girls on the hall had experienced the same incident, aka the R.A.'s boyfriend. Clearly not only was she breaking the very rules she was enforcing by letting her boyfriend in at night, but she was doing this bizarre lesson without the knowledge of the school.

Later my friend filed a complaint and the R.A. was relieved of her duties. To anser the question on everybody's mind, my genitalia never experienced the joys of my friends crotch nor fear induced boning. 

Sadly, The End.

1371684502.0	1goviu	The Feet	Scrambie	285	27	33	"This happened to my friend Aimee when we were growing up. Just for a bit of background, we were only around 5 years old at the time, living in central Victoria, Australia in a small country town. 

Aimee grew up in a quiet part of town. There was never crime in this town when we were young. It was safe. 

She would often tell her family that ""the feet"" visited her during the night. Her parents would just laugh, thinking it was her over active imagination. This went on for months, Aimee talking about visits from The Feet during the night. Her parents put it down to her having an imaginary friend. 

Aimee would say that The Feet would come into her room and just stand there. Sometimes for up to 10 minutes. Aimee would try to talk to The Feet but she never got a reply from them. She would often see them walk past her bedroom door, throughout the night. 

It wasn't until push came to shove that her parents believed her. 

One night, the whole family awoke to a loud bang in the house. Her dad got up and went out to investigate. There was a strange man sitting on their couch, eating away happily like nothing was out of the ordinary. The police were called and he was escorted out. 

It turns out that this man had been coming into their house for months. As soon as their lights went out, he'd let himself in (keeping in mind it was a small town and no one locked their doors). 
The Feet that Aimee would talk about were his. She only ever saw his feet because she slept on the bottom bunk of a bunk bed. From where she would lie, she could never see above his waist. 

The loud bang that alerted the parents of their visitor was because Aimees mum had left the dishwasher door open, he had gotten so used to navigating around their house in the dark that he tripped over it because it was normally closed. 

Aimee and I are 25 now and this story still creeps us out. "	t5_2t3t8	True

1343984481.0	xm2lv	A night out with the girls.	whengaysattack	310	54	76	"I've been debating if I should tell this story or not, but seeing all of the wonderful writing from you wonderful redditors persuaded me that I should just come out with it.

The story happened a few months ago, and I haven't told anyone about it yet, save for the friend that is indirectly involved. (All names in the story are changed, obviously.)

Anyway, it was about a year ago next month. It was my 18th birthday. To celebrate, I got together with three coworkers: Mallorie, Lisa, and Wendy. 

Mallorie and Lisa were eager to go party, but I stayed back in the car with Wendy while she finished off a beer. We talked and talked for about a good hour, and we got to the subject of sexuality (Wendy was drunk, I was not). I came out to her (I'm a guy... and gay.) Wendy didn't give a fuck, we had a good laugh, and she promised to help me get a guy for my birthday. I'm not the type of person to do that, but I went along with it.

We go in, dance for an hour or so. Meanwhile, Wendy continues to get shit-faced. She buys drink after drink, beer after beer, and she starts hitting on all of these guys. I forgot to mention that Wendy has been in a relationship for over 8 years, but when she gets drunk, she's out of control. 

I go back and sit by the dance floor. Mallorie and Lisa are annoyed with Wendy, and tell me they are going to go up to the second floor (where the bar is) and that they will be back down in a few minutes. It wasn't all that fun, because I was the only one under 21. I felt like I needed a drink; I don't do social situations like that very well.

A few minutes pass, and Wendy stumbles over, laughing hysterically. She tells me that she gave this guy my number. I'm shocked, then figure she's joking. She forgets about it really fast, and we spend the night dancing. Mallorie and Lisa come back down, and the night goes on without any problems.

It's about 3am. We're all tired. The club is about to close. Lisa, Mallorie, and Wendy are all in the bathroom, heaving their guts. Completely shit-faced. I walk outside to get some fresh air, when my phone rings. I hear Wendy calling for me, so I answer my phone without paying attention to the number.

""Hello,"" I say.

There's a long pause. I hear breathing, then muffled laughter in the background. I hear someone 'shushing' someone else, then I hear a faint, ""Hi.""

""Who is this?"" I'm tending to Wendy while talking on the phone.

""Your friend gave me your number."" The voice is low and garbled. In the pit of my stomach I feel uneasy, a chill runs through me, but I brush it off.

""Yeah, sorry about her. She's drunk,"" I laugh, teasing Wendy as she frowns. There's another pause on the other end. I hear a clicking sound. Wendy runs to the corner to puke again. I roll my eyes, now focusing on the conversation.

""I'm sorry she bothered you,"" I go on, ""I understand--""

""I'm going to rape your friend, you faggot."" The words slice through my phone speaker and rattle me to the core. The way he said it, the swiftness of his tongue. The emphasis on the word *faggot*. I sucked in a quick breath.

I pull the phone away. The screen says *UNKNOWN NUMBER*. At this point I'm freaking out, but I'm the only one sober enough to form a coherent thought. 

Instead of pressing for info, I hang up. I get everyone out of the bathroom and into the car. As we're all getting situated, bright headlights come on behind me. My phone rings again. I answer.

""Three of them for me, faggot. Let's race."" For some reason, maybe it was my flat-out terror and shock of the situation, but I wanted to laugh. My friends were drunkenly questioning who called me, and I waved them off, staring at the bright lights behind me.

I pulled out of the parking lot. The car behind me followed. My heart was pounding. I didn't know what to do. Wendy and Lisa fell asleep. Mallorie was singing some dumbass Justin Bieber song at the top of her lungs, and I was driving to get the fuck away from this psycho asshole behind me.

My phone kept ringing--Unknown Number--and I gunned it. At this point, I didn't even care if I got pulled over. I welcomed some police interference. But luck wasn't on my side that night, and the streets were empty. I did the only thing I knew to do: drive straight to the police station.

""Mallorie, there's someone chasing us!"" I was freaking out, looking into the rear view mirror, and doing 80 in a 45 zone.

""Dude, you're fuckin' wasted,"" Mallorie grinned, leaning close to me. I shook my head, swerving onto the main highway. The lights behind us followed, and I was near a nervous breakdown. I started thinking about all of those crazed lunatic urban legends about someone following you and there's a killer in your backseat. In my case, it wasn't a killer back there, but my two drunken friends, asleep and drooling on one another.

I see the sign for the police station. Mallorie is still singing, oblivious, and I swerve into the parking lot. The lights follow me. Mallorie suddenly sobers up when she sees the idle police cars in the lot.

""Dude, we can't go here! I'm drunk!"" She looked up at me, panicked. I waited in the parking lot. The lights eventually pull out after stopping for what seemed like HOURS behind our car. As the lights pull onto the highway, I see that it's a white truck. I memorize the make, model, brand, etc. And the plate number.

I drive everyone home, and call the police and report the phone calls and tell them the plate number. Turns out, the truck was stolen. No idea who was calling me. There's no telling what would have happened if I hadn't went to the police station. It's fucked up, and I told Mallorie all of it the next morning.

I'm never going to the club again.


EDIT: Also, my username has nothing to do with this story. Sorry for any confusion. I don't believe in making throwaway accounts, and I've had this name since I joined Reddit!

**EDIT 2**: ""Wendy"" and I were talking today (literally about just 2 hours ago) about going to the club again sometime, and she told me that someone's car was stolen just last week in the club's parking lot, and there were reports filed that people were being followed by this car. HOWEVER, the people that made the claims (about being followed) were also drunk. Wendy knew all this because, *of course*, she was at the club when it happened. I am hoping that this is not in any way related to what I went through."	t5_2t3t8	True
1357459025.0	161ww7	Dude, no. 	Tinyassfeet	305	48	32	"Like most girls, I baby sat a lot in high school. It was my freshman year, I was 14, and babysitting for one of my fathers coworkers. They had two daughters, a baby and a 5 year old we'll call Amy. 

Amy was over at a neighbors house for a birthday party, so for the beginning of the evening it was just the baby and I. We were watching TV and playing with her toys. About a hour in to the evening there's a knock on the door. I get up, leaving the baby on the floor in her baby chair. There's a man at the door, about my height (5' 11"") or so. 

I immediately get a terrible feeling. I am instantly terrified of this man. There is nothing unusual about him. White, blonde and wearing a button down with a windbreaker. He was carrying a clipboard and wearing (what looked like a very sketchy, potentially homemade) name tag. I decide I would rather talk through the door than open it. 

I ask who hes with, he tells me the electric company. That's strange because the mother of this house is INSANELY well put together. She wouldn't have forgotten to mention something like this to me. He also tries to tell me that he needs to check the bedrooms for gas leaks. I was a 14 year old girl, but that's damn sketchy. I tell the man I need to check, because I don't think we have an appointment. I pick up the baby and go down the hall to the kitchen where I call the mother. I stand where I can still see the door. 

She tells me that the gas company isn't supposed to be there... she tells me that shes going to call them just to make sure. I hang up and go back to the door to talk to the man again. I didn't want to be rude. I'm holding the baby still, I make sure he sees her through the window. I tell him that the woman that lives here is calling the gas company to make sure hes supposed to be there. 

He starts yelling at me that he is supposed to be there. Hes saying its cold out, I need to let him in. I get scared and put the baby in her chair in the other room. I go back to the door and tell him I have to wait for the woman to call back. He groans and keeps berating me. 

The mother calls back, she called the gas company, not only is her house not on a list to be checked, but no house in her neighborhood. Shes called the police and is calling her neighbors. Shes on her way home with the father. 

I'm pissed. Not only is this guy not with the gas company but hes being a dick and freaking me out. I puff myself up and go back to the door. I look out the window, no company trucks. Nothing but little 4 doors. I tell him to leave. He starts yelling and pounding on the door. I keep telling him ""YOU AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE HERE. I HONESTLY DON'T THINK YOU ARE EVEN WITH THE GAS COMPANY. GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE."" All of a sudden one of the neighbor men shows up. 

6'6"" black man, probably around 250 or so. He gives the guy one look, tells him ""Get the fuck out of here."" And the guy was off. The neighbor leaves and comes back with Amy the older girl. He stays with me until the police and parents show up.

I later learned the same guy was going around to other neighbors and ""inspecting"" gas mains in the houses. It was suspected that he was casing houses to break into. I've always been a little freaked out over what could have happened if I let him.

TL;DR: Man pretending to be from gas company shows up while I'm babysitting, we don't have an appointment, neither does anyone in our neighborhood. I try to scare him off, parents call over neighbor. He was apparently casing houses in the neighborhood.

1365511106.0	1bzhlx	I was young, but not stupid	mistressfluffy	309	54	33	"I've actually had quite a few stalking experiences, which I think comes from being a petite female (AKA easy target), but I'll tell you about the one that happened when I was 13.

I was living in an apartment in an inner city.  The city had a lot of sex offenders living in it and I knew this.  I was living on the second floor.  It was summer vacation and I was home alone with my sister.  I got a knock on the back door and I thought it was another tenant since the person would have had to get into the building to knock directly on my back door.  I open the door and I see an overweight, disheveled, creepy man holding a clip board.  He said he worked for the city and was taking the census so he needed to come in and ask me questions.  I knew it wasn't the year for the census (that was last year!) and that a city worker would have come to the from door, not entered the building, and would have been wearing a badge.  I tell him to go away and slam the door in his face and I locked it.  This happened at about 12pm.

At 5pm my mother called to tell me that she would be running late coming home.  I took the opportunity to tell her about the creepy guy that came to the house.  At that moment, I felt like I should open the back door and check if the guy was still there.  I open it and he's laying down on the floor right outside the door!  He had waited outside the door for 5 hours!  I scream that I'm going to call the police and the guy takes off.  Obviously the guy had been waiting around hoping he could sneak in at some point. 

To this day, and I'm 30 years old now, I will not open the door unless I know and am expecting you.  People know that they have to call me on my cell phone because I wont open the door otherwise."	t5_2t3t8	True
1372313323.0	1h5w0k	Lets meet...oh, shit, maybe not.	ConstantHope	301	48	94	"This just happened so I'm a bit shaky, kind words would be really appreciated. 

I suppose I should start off saying I am a 20 year old women. 
I live in a college dorm room- it is built in a triangular shape meaning if I look out of my window I can see other people in their rooms. My side of the building is slightly taller than the other side, so I can see more into their rooms than they can into mine- if someone stands at their window I can see them.

I sometimes sit on my desk next to the window to have a smoke, meaning that people can see me.

Anyway, for the last few months a guy on the opposite side of the building a  floor below me (I am on fourth, he is on third) has been waving at me in a friendly manner. He seems to never sleep, meaning no matter when I smoke- he seems to be there.

For the last month or so we have been kinda like smoking buddies, he sees me, waves, we awkwardly wave at each other while I smoke, then I go back to my reddit recluse on my bed where no one can see me. I always thought this was coincidence, however now I think he might have been looking out his window at me.

This morning- about half an hour ago in fact- he seemed really into waving, and was waving me over. He seemed nice enough, so when he came down to the courtyard and waved me down I thought 'why not have a smoke outside instead and have a chat with this friendly man'.


He was wearing just a tee shirt and I was pulling a 'its cold face' so that if it was awkward I could blame the cold and make a hasty retreat, so he asked me to go up to his room. 

He seemed pretty normal and nice, I had no alarm bells going off apart from 'this may be awkward'. 

It's pretty normal for people to casually hang out in their rooms, and the way he said it was not sexual.


 I went upstairs with him to his room. when we were walking up the stairs I started to feel a bit like 'a lamb to the slaughter' because he was brushing close to me in a way that is not necessary- there was plenty of room on the steps. 

I took note of this feeling, however because of social etiquette I kept going. 
He had not done anything wrong, running away would have just been too weird for me to do (why are we like this? surly our instincts should overpower stupid bloody social etiquette? the amount of times I have been placid in a situation where my whole body is screaming 'get out get out' is just stupid. If I were weaker or we were all animals, I would be dead by now)

We got to his room, I took note that he did not lock the doors. 
He offered me a seat on his bed (another norm here, our rooms only come with one chair) and he sat on the chair and we chatty pretty normally. 
 He seemed a bit shaky, and admitted he had been partying earlier this night/ morning, so was still a bit tipsy. His niceness and general normal-ness meant that this didn't really worry me, a lot of students drink, and after all he has been waving very nicely at me for a while now.

We talked about religion (I hinted I was a strict christian, even thought I do not class myself at this, I wanted to hint that I didn't do sex. He said he was a strict Muslim, and I thought 'my instincts must be wrong, a strict Muslim wouldn't make a move on a girl they barely know.) 

He asked if I had a boyfriend, a pretty normal question for a guy to ask a girl, and I lied and said I did- I always lie about this, because I am awful at rejecting people who ask me out.
 
He moved on to the bed to offer me a lighter, which sent my 'lamb to the slaughter' senses tingling again- however I have sat on a bed with many a new acquaintance and nothing has happened, and, like I said, we are students. Hanging out in our dorms on our beds is what we do. 


We talked about things for a little while, he was edging closer, and I dont know how it came up but he made a comment about me looking like a 'wealthy white girl'. This sent my alarm bells going off at deafening volumes, as that coupled with the way he looked me up and down like meat made me feel somewhat like he was thinking 'hmm white girls are easy'. I'm sorry if this sounds racist- round here there is a general misconception that white girls are all slutty and up for it. 
Then he mentions that he has been looking at me for almsot 5 months now, saying about christmas decorations and stuff that I had no idea he could see from the angle that his window is at. In fact, I KNOW he couldn't have seen them. It dawns on me that this guy must have been going up to fourth floor and looking in my room for ages now without me knowing, seeing further in to my room than I ever thought he could.  I starts to sound like  a stalker, he mentions seeing my bum... I dont parade  in front of my window naked and I would need to be in front of my window for him to see me. I realize he has been watching me.

 I made a joke to move the subject on, 
He laughed, and started
 touching
 my 
face.

Like, who does that? Apart from Adele and that is after she has set fire to rain so by then you know the shit is getting real anyway. 

I moved his hand away and laughed it off. Social etiquette means I cannot leave without saying goodbye first, so I start to make an excuse. He laughs again and he starts touching my face and before I know it his arm is around me pretty tight and he is going for my face/ neck with his mouth while simultaneously using his other hand to try and drag my top down. 

I say no and try to pull away but he keeps going for it. 'No' obviously means nothing to this guy, I fear I may be about to get raped. He tightens his grip and I know I'm about to fall down onto the bed, meaning he will have me flat out and pretty much defenseless. 

I think : fuck this, I didn't spend hours in the gym to not be able to overpower a short arse like this! I rip  him off of me- which Im pretty proud of as he was trying for a vice grip there, and made my polite exit speech 'sorry I need to get going, nice meet you though, sorry so busy!' like the fucking polite following-social-etiquette-even-when-no-one-else-is douche canoe I am. 

I get out, see him go toward the door but by then I am down the stairs, out side, up my stairs and in my fucking apartment with all the doors locked. 

I think I managed to close my curtain without him seeing. 

I am only realizing now my arm really hurts. My mind automatically blanks horrible experiences from my mind and I have a bad memory anyway, so I am already pretty fuzzy with what happened. I think my arm hurts from how tight he had a hold of me but I'm not too sure- It might be from sitting in a weird angle to type this. 


I have three or four days left living opposite this guy. Fuck.

**TL;DR:** talked to the guy who has been waving at me from his bedroom for the last month or so, he tried to take my top of and kiss me. I think he has been looking in to my room for a while now, and he has seen things that you can not see from his room, meaning he must have been looking from other angles.

I was being a typically self absorbed teen, on my laptop (school provided). My brother and sister were looking at the menu and my mom was just talking to us about our day and what not. There wasn't anyone else in the place, just on guy working behind the counter (manager I think) when this guy came over out of nowhere and started mumbling something to my mom.  Seriously, Waffle Houses are small and I dont know where he was before, since he wasnt there when we sat down. I couldn't really hear what he was saying but I heard my mom say WHAT?! really incredulous. The guy just kept talking to my mom and she loudly told him to fuck off. The guy mumbled something else and just...wandered outside.

My mom gets up and goes to the manager and my siblings and I aren't thinking anything of it because well..my mom is a bit dramatic sometimes.  We see the manager go and talk to the guy and the guy leaving.  Mom comes back sits down, pissed. Manager comes over and apologized saying the dude was banned and he was really sorry and the meals were comped.

He leaves and my siblings and are like WTF Mom? She tells us the guy had come over and wanted to know how much I was, like for sale. Then wanted to know how much my sister was, if he could have us and just...fucking weird and creepy.

I considered posting this on a throwaway account but whatever.                                                    
                                                                                                           
I was about 11 or 12 and living in upstate NY. I had made friends with a girl in my class, Stacy, who was very poor and lived in what was considered the ""ghetto"" of my town. (If you've ever lived in upstate, you know how laughable that is.) We'd often hang out at my house, where there was plenty of healthy snacks and I had cable, but one day I was invited to a sleepover at her place. I packed a bag and headed over after school. Stacy's mom (who didn't have it going on) had friends over, and they were drinking shitty wine and generally acting like douchebags before they headed out to the bar to get more trashed. They went out to have a cigarette, except for one guy. I can't remember his name, but he was about thirty, tall, lean, and very creepy. He sat down with us and made small talk. I noticed Stacy looked very uncomfortable, which made me uncomfortable also.                                                                          
""You're very pretty,"" he said, inching closer to me on the couch. I thanked him and tried to move away. He caught my arm. ""I bet all the boys in your class love you. You're sexy as hell.""                                     
I was pudgy and never wore makeup, like the other girls in my class, so I wasn't particularly popular, and being a dumb kid I told him so. He smiled at me. ""I'll be your boyfriend. Want some wine? How about a cigarette? I bet you look hot when you smoke.""                                        
Stacy got up and left. I tried to follow her but he still had a firm grip on my arm. With his other hand he caressed the inside of my thigh and moved upward. I froze, not knowing what to do. I had never experienced sex before, being a very sheltered girl, and all I knew was that this was wrong and terrifying. He slipped his hand inside my pants and I managed to tear my arm away and run upstairs. I locked myself in the bathroom until I heard them leave, then got to the phone and called my dad. I didn't tell him what happened. I cried for almost two days until he finally coaxed it out of me. He was livid. I was forbidden from ever going to Stacy's again. My mom lived near NYC and we called her. She drove the four hours that night and together we went to the police.                         
The police in my town are notoriously lazy. They took my statement, said this man was ""not unknown"" to them, and no arrest was made. At lunch the next day, two girls I'd never talked to, Ashley and Desiree, sat at my table. They told me that he did the same thing to Desiree when she had a sleepover with Stacy. Ashley had agreed to be his girlfriend (she was and still is astoundingly stupid) and he had forcibly taken her virginity, which her parents reported to the police, hence him being ""not unknown."" To my knowledge, he got away with everything.

1374901582.0	1j598q	Poker Face	awriternamedwilliams	301	49	130	"This happened in Antioch, California. 
It was around 2AM.

I was at a friend’s house, safe in warm sheltered suburbia.  
We were having a lot to drink, chit chatting, enjoying ourselves. Of course, when you’re having fun, time hits the fast forward button, and those few minutes turn into an hour.  
I had too much to drink. 

My friend has a bit of an abrupt bed time, so I had to dodge out early, still intoxicated. I felt too shameful thinking I'd be asking too much to stay in his house to sleep off the drunkenness. I suppose he was either too rude or too drunk to consider it himself. 

Whatever. Sometimes a little inconvenience makes you appreciate everything else.
I needed about another hour or so to sober up and drive back.

As fast as time passed during my stay, it decided to drastically slow down as soon as I stepped out of his house. It was a cul-de-sac area, a concrete jungle with the stem of the street breaking into a fork. Alongside the road, my car was parked; the only street light that worked was in the middle of the cul-de-sac's circle, about 80 yards away. I stumbled towards my car, produced my keys, felt the metal line up, opened my door and shifted to the back seat. Because this was a dark, strange and unfamiliar neighborhood, I took the left over newspapers and a sweater in my backseat to cover myself up.

I was a little scared, I wanted to camouflage myself and not just be some guy awkwardly sitting in his car waiting for time to pass in order to drive home. 

I couldn't fall asleep. The uncomfortable feeling of a cheap backseat bed enshrouded in darkness didn't make the chance of slumber easier, it felt too ominous. And of course, my mind began to wonder. I thought of worst case scenarios, like how the police would shine their lights on me through the window, or a drunk driver hitting my car, and….

...wait...
 
...in the distance, about 100 yards away, I could hear footsteps approaching. The gravel scuffed with each step forward, growing in proximity, but periodically taking stops. 

I wondered why until it made sense in my mind: whoever it was was probably looking through cars carefully, with the intent to steal one. I couldn't recall how many cars were on the block, but I counted three full stops until he was at my window, breathing. 

I froze. 

There was no more than one foot between us. The car encapsulated me as I lay hidden beneath backseat clutter, forming myself into an object, trying my hardest to be unnoticeable, unmoving and simply not there.

""I seeeeeeeeee youuuuuuuu""

Said a 40+ year old man in perverse baby talk.

Imagine when you were playing hide and seek, and one of your friends tricks you in coming out. He said it in that tone of voice, as if baiting me, like he was questioning whether the clutter in backseat was just clutter.... or a person.

I didn't want to move or check the window. 
I remained clutter. 
Give me an academy award.

My body reacted by minimizing my breathing so much that I felt paralyzed. I dare not look. My eyes fixated on the back of the passenger seat. I didn't blink, I didn't move, I didn't breathe; my heart was pounding so hard it shook my body with each throb.

He circled around the car, my ears didn't fail me. I heard the steps. I felt like I was part of the car, I could feel him touching the trunk as he carefully pressed down on it, as if to test the alarm, as if to test me.

I was in the middle of fight or flight. I couldn't do either without elevating danger.  I was frozen and hoping to God he was bluffing.

He circled the car again. The door handle to my right jiggled. He was pulling it multiple times.

""I seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee youuuuuuuu"" 

Same tone, but more agitated and stressed, more convinced that he was trying to make that clutter move, revealing itself to be of his expectations that it was me.

My muscles tensed like a cow before slaughter.

*Tap tap tap*

That had to be metal against glass.
Take a penny right now and tap your window.

A crow bar? A knife? A rock? A gun? My eyes fixated on the seat in front of me, never averting my gaze – like he was.  I was covered enough to where I couldn't see beyond the seat in front of me. I know I couldn’t see him, but I could feel his eyes resting on top of me.

""My name is poker face. What's your name?""

The voice changed, in a lower demented and serious tone.
My mind forced a visual, it wasn't anything human. 

I already accepted my death. I was ready to be shot in the head, ready to take a life changing bullet, multiple knife wounds. Just make this sleep bearable, not excruciating, as you drain me of life.

I wouldn't know how to react, my thoughts grew dimmer. I imagined my friend waking up the next morning after a calm night of safe and sound sleep only to discover my mutilated, defiled and bloodied body hanging outside my car door.

It was then I heard nothing but my own heart. What was this person doing now? Just staring at me in the middle of the night? Talking to me, or a messy pile in the back seat? 

Time froze. The footsteps were being swallowed in the distance. Thank God he left. I waited another hour until the sun showed hints of itself. I jumped in my front seat and bolted out of there, wide eyed and sober.



**TL;DR** - Tried to sleep in the backseat of my car at 3AM. I was hidden underneath clothes, newspaper, etc. Clown creature outside my car staring in, talking to me.

1363470227.0	1afhll	Chelsea King's Killer	APG619	301	49	27	"I'm not sure if you will remember but in 2009, 14 year old Amber Dubois and in 2010, 17 year old Chelsea King, were raped and murdered while by 30 year old John Gardner.  Chelsea was murdered while she was running at Lake Hodges which is surrounded by hills and many different paths.  Here's a link to John's wiki page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Albert_Gardner 

To preface I'm a female.  So Lake Hodges is in Rancho Bernardo which is in San Diego, where I live.  At the time I was living in Rancho Bernardo with my folks and I was 23.  I was watching my friends adorable little chihuahua named Khloe and decided to take a hike down the Lake Hodges path as she's a good chihuahua, always stays by my side and isn't like one of those annoying little dogs so I walk her off-leash.  

30 minutes into my hike, I hear someone jogging up behind and me and always being aware of my surroundings, turned around and looked at the guy.  He seemed only a bit older than me and smiled.  ""Cute dog"" he said as he slowed down to keep pace with me.  He followed up with ""do I know you from somewhere?""  

I told him I wasn't sure and we played the name-game.  Quick background info: my parents never let me go hiking/walking, etc without my cell phone so I purchased a cute fanny-pack long ago to store my cell, pepper spray and other /r/trees necessities.  I didn't feel too scared or threatened because A) I had my phone and pepper spray and B) it turned out we knew a whole bunch of people in common from when I was in high-school; plus we were on the main path.  He told me his name was John and I told him mine.  He even mentioned he thought he might know who my boyfriend is due to mutual friends.  

I asked him what he was doing at the lake and he told me he was looking for new spots for his Hash run group (where you drink and run, look it up it's actually a great idea).  I know a couple people who participate in the hash runs so again, no red flags there.  Participating in the same ""after-school"" activity aka smoking weed, I agreed to smoke a bowl with him and led him up the hill to my favorite spot where we could sit on a bench overlooking the neighborhood.  

We spend about 30 minutes trying to figure out exactly how we knew each other and we narrowed it down to a specific group of guys I hung out with in middle-school but drifted away from in high school because of drugs.  Again, we connected the dots and laughed about stories of old friends- nothing to be concerned about.  Throughout our conversation, he learned the dog wasn't mine, my parent's were home waiting for me (it was the weekend and I was going to go out to dinner with the family) and tidbits of information about my relationship as I was texting my BF every so often.  

As we walked down the mountain and onto the street, he wrote his name and number on a McDonald's receipt and told me to give him a call.  I didn't give him my number; I just said I'd text him sometime soon to meet up again.  Either way, I had no intentions of doing so.  2 weeks later, John was arrested for the rape and murder of Chelsea King.  He confessed to Amber's murder when they offered up a life-sentence instead of the death penalty.  He took it and plead guilty.  When I heard I found the piece of paper with his name and number on it and drove to my boyfriend's house as fast as I could to tell him the story.  No reason to bring up a casual encounter previously as I no longer talk to those mutual friends and like I said, I had no intention of actually ever getting in contact with him again.  

I'm not sure if it was my demeanor (when I'm alone I stand taller, walk differently and make it a point to look strangers in the eye), the fact that I was texting throughout the encounter so he knew I was in constant contact with someone, that my folks were home expecting me to return, that the dog wasn't mine so again, someone was expecting me to return the dog or maybe I just wasn't his ""type,"" but he tried no such maneuvers with me.  My first thought was that we knew too many mutual friends, but I later heard that Chelsea King was best friends with John's best friend's sister.  Either way, I was thoroughly  freaked for a good month.  The only people I told were my boyfriend and brother because I know my parents would have flipped.  

So there it is, my creepy encounter with a rapist/murder. That was the first time I met John and obviously the last.  I honestly don't think he actually recognized me when he first ran up or knew my boyfriend, but when he later realized that we had plenty of friends in common may have figured it was a lost cause.  He didn't know I had pepper spray but I did which always helps my confidence level when alone.  I haven't thought about that day in years so my memory is foggy but that's what I remember.

1340177470.0	vbi9b	My dog had better instincts than I did. 	stayuplate	294	43	65	"EDIT: Added pics of the house at the bottom for those who are curious.

So, after creeping the community for awhile I decided to post my own little story. Here's some background that will add to the eeriness of the story: Before I left for college, I lived with my mom and step-dad on a huge non-operational farm in the thumb of Michigan, right on Lake Huron. The estate had a four bedroom manor that was built in the 1800's, a groundskeeper hut, a large warehouse type barn, another building that housed cattle, and two smaller sheds that we used for outdoor storage. The barns were in a state of neglect - structurally they were sound, but they had all the fixings of creepy buildings: crackling white paint on the inside, old artifacts of when the farm was in use, etc. The house itself looked exactly like the house from the Amytiville horror series (the interior resembled the house from the Others, so just imagine that). 

The entire estate itself sat on about 15 acres, with the house and barns sitting on a plot of land about as big as 3 football fields. Behind the house was a thick forest which surrounded the property. In front of the house was a dirt road, another smaller forest, and then the shoreline to the lake. We had no neighbors, and were the only property in a 4 mile radius. 

Anyway, when I was about 16 my parents went across the country for a wedding, leaving me alone in the house for a weekend. I was fairly responsible and the town I lived in was tiny (about 1,500 residents total) and incredibly safe so there wasn't really a problem with trust. Our family dog, a giant purebred siberian husky named Sheeba, was always around. I was used to being home alone before and usually relished the privacy, but after that Saturday I refused to ever stay alone.

Most of the day on Saturday I spent at my friend Leigh Ann's house. Around 8PM I decided to head home and make myself some dinner. The kitchen was toward the back of the house, with a large double window facing one of the barns and the old care taker's house. Sheeba was outside laying in the yard, enjoying the summer's night air. I had most of the lights off in the house (and there were no lights outside, since we were so isolated). I was standing at the stove stirring a pot of noodles when I saw something flicker out of my peripheral vision. I walked over to the window, and sure enough, I saw what looked like the faint glow of a lantern or something coming from the tiny window of the caretaker's hut. I'm not sure what I thought, since I dismissed it being some kids exploring, but nonetheless I grabbed a flashlight and Sheeba and I walked out to the hut. Opened the door, and there was one of those giant flood lights turned on, just laying on the floor. I brushed it off as it just fell from some shelf and turned on itself.

It's a little less than a quarter mile walk from the caretaker's hut to my house, which stood on a mound/hill on the front of the estate. I stood outside the hut's door, petting Sheeba and throwing rocks at the creek that ran through the yard. The stove was turned off and the night air felt nice, so I wasn't in a hurry. I was crouching down playing with my dog when I saw something that I'll never, ever, ever forget.

I saw the kitchen light come on in the house. Then I saw the bathroom light come on. Then, as if someone was walking up the stairs, I saw a hallway light turn on, and then the two bedroom lights that faced my way turn on. What. the. fuck. I know I have to go in the house and check it out, but that's not what I particularly wanted to do at the moment. My phone was in the house charging. At that point, I did what any other 16 year old would do: I walked into the barn, grabbed an old farmer's scythe from the wall, and slowly walked up to the house with Sheeba by my side. Before I went anywhere near the door, I decided that someone was either robbing us, or it was one of my friend's who knew I would be home alone messing with me. Either way, I felt like I wanted to take the upper hand in the situation. The circuit breaker for the entire house was located in the barn next to it. I cut the power, grabbed my dog, weapon and a flash light, and walked in the door. 

Sheeba instantly bolted off from the kitchen into the lower part of the house, checking things out. I waited a couple minutes for her. She started barking, loudly, then growling. I heard some weird shifting noises, which I blamed the dog for. I was about to start walking through my house, when Sheeba came running back into the kitchen right past me, knocking open the loose screen door and running off into the night. Again, my 16 year old fearless mind thought she just caught the scent of a fox or something, and ran off after it. I wasn't really worried since she would run off all the time and come back fifteen minutes later (again, 15 acres for her to explore). 

I check out the lower part of the house, which wasn't that terrible considering the fact that I was used to the creaking. The old parlor room was used as our living room, and had giant floor to ceiling windows. I was staring out at them, looking for who knows what, when I heard a crash upstairs. You know that moment when you think you see/hear something scary, and you just play it off? That was what I was feeling RIGHT before I heard that. I decided I had looked for enough trouble that night, grabbed my phone and ran outside. I was walking down the end of my driveway, about to open the door to my jeep, when all the lights in my house went back on. Someone had turned the circuit breaker back on in the shed, which was on the other side of the house from where I was. Then, from across the estate, I see all of the buildings light up. Someone had turned on the breakers for the entire property. 

At this point I should've called the cops, but a part of me held back and wanted to find whoever was fucking with me. I ran as fast as I could, crazy scythe in hand, over to the barn with the breaker box. Nobody was there. The only thing out of place was that my step-dad's mini fridge, which he kept out there when he was working, was wide open. I closed the fridge door.

I called Leigh Ann and told her what was going on and started to walk back to the house when I saw whatever was messing me. A tall figure was just standing in the middle of our circular driveway, looking at me. I yelled ""what the fuck"" at him/her and ran toward whoever it was, and they took off across the street into the woods on the other side of the house. It was so dark that I couldn't really tell what they were wearing. It was definitely a person, and they were tall and lanky.

Leigh Ann told me she was coming over, and at this point I guess I didn't need to call the cops since the person had fled. She gets here, and we both go upstairs to see what was going on. Only three things were out of place, but they were enough to leave us in a really unsettled mood.

1. My mom used one of the rooms as a guest room, which also was home to all of her ceramic dolls. She had them displayed all around the room. There was about 40 dolls, total. All of the dolls were moved close to the bed, with each doll's gaze pointed straight at the bed. On the bed itself were two dolls placed in a crude sexual position.

2. The upstairs bathroom had one of those old fashioned deep tubs. The shower curtain was pulled off the rings, and there was water and a shampoo bottle in the tub. There was a doll laying on the floor with wet, soapy hair. Like someone started washing the doll's hair, and then left. 

3. The last, and probably most creepiest thing we saw. Someone had taken a doll and hung it from the ceiling lamp in my bedroom by some of my ties that were tied together. I also had photographs taped to my bedroom wall of my friends, and they were all torn down. I wish I would've snapped some pictures with my phone, but in the midst of everything going on that was the last thing I wanted to do.

After securing the house and locking all the doors, Leigh Ann and I called the cops. The officer (who I knew personally - small town) checked the immediate property and the house. Since nothing was really 'damaged' and the person wasn't around anymore, he just offered to patrol the house every hour or so and to check up on me. I decided to just sleep over at Leigh Ann's house for the next few days. I never told my parents what happened since I didn't want to scare them. I came back every afternoon checking to see if my dog had returned and to leave food/water out for her, but nothing. Sheeba came back four days after she ran off, which is the longest she's ever been gone. The incident didn't really traumatize me as much as you think, but I did watch my step around the house at night and looked at my small town in a different view.

The person never came back to my knowledge. There were some nights, however, where I'd be laying in bed in the middle of the night and hear Sheeba start growling. I always tried to brush it off. I kept the door closed to the guest room at all times and never wanted to see a ceramic doll again.

I haven't been back to the house since 2008, and my Mom no longer lives there, but she did say in the month before they relocated that the several lawn gnomes she decorated her garden with would be moved to face the front door, all staring at it. 

Ridiculous, but true.

1332407795.0	r85jz	I owe her my life. 	Gothichu	301	47	50	"This particular close encounter of mine, occurred sometime in 2005. 

 I was somewhere between 11-12 years old. My mom had just moved

 back to her hometown of Kooskia Idaho, a teeny little town with a

 population of approximately 654. She came across a little cafe called 

the Idaho Back-Roads, that had a for sale sign in the window. She 

wandered in and discovered the place was still owned by friends of

 hers from years back. They were an older couple, who were coming 

up on their retirement age. They were eager to sell, and soon enough 

my mom was the proud owner of a quaint little cafe. We spruced the

 place up( it had minor wear and tear those older people couldn't 

routinely take care of) and reopened in the summer of 05.

It was a mom and pop sort of place, called the Idaho Back-Roads 

Cafe, located in a small town on the Snake River called Kooskia, 

Idaho. Kooskia is pretty much the last stop on Highway 95 if you're 

heading out to Missoula, Montana. There's a smattering of tiny towns 

in between, but Kooskia tends to get a lot of tourism in the spring 

and summer months. When my mother bought the Back-Roads, we 

often ran into touring elderly people, families, lone travelers, and 

bikers. Our food was decently priced, and to several customers, it 

tasted like home. Well, the cafe was our home, as we had a teeny 

tiny apartment in the back, in which we all lived. My older sister, 

Taleah, lived with my mother full-time at 16. Myself and Seanna lived 

with her father during the school year, until our mom could find a

 better place to live that suited 3 girls. We were excited to work, and 

live in our restaurant.

 Yes, all of us worked that little cafe, as my mother could only run 

the restaurant and pay bills, not hire on a full-time staff on the 

pay-roll. Like I said, Kooskia was a tiny town, and once tourism left

 we scraped by until the next season. As a 12 year old girl might 

believe, it was great waiting tables. It actually was, at the time I was

 a small blonde girl, with gangly limbs and a quick smile. This kept the

 tips flowing, as little old people find children irresistible, and were 

incredibly generous. I saved my tips for various things a child wants,

 but mainly I stashed the money away to help pay for school supplies.

 My mother raised us to be able to take care of ourselves, and that 

earning your own money for things you wanted was rewarding. 

Our little apartment in the back was one open room, with two doors 

on opposite walls from each other, and no windows. A narrow hallway

 led to a laundry room of sorts, with a stack-able unit of washer and 

drier, two huge freezers, and a linen cupboards. Another section was 

a ridiculously small bathroom, painted a Pepto pink, if I remember

 correctly. Next was the storage room, with our business/family 

computer( Windows 98' Gateway :) ) Our bigger fridge and a sort of 

walk-in freezer, then one small step away and you were in the 

kitchen of our eatery. 
Out back, was a gated pen, in which we kept our family dog during 

restaurant hours. Reggie was just growing out of her puppy stage, 

with her too big ears and gangly legs. She was a Wolf and German 

Shepard mix, and was starting to grow into all the muscle of the 

Shepard, while maintaining the look of a wolf. She was a pretty thing, 

all white, save for a patch of red that ran along her back and tail.

 She was bought for my older sister, but being a grand majority of 

wolf, she regarded us all as her pack. 

One particular day, mid-summer, we were all dillegently working away, 

when a man came into the restaurant. My sister, Seanna, seated him

 in a booth and took off to grab a menu, water, and his cutlery. I was

 working that day as well, and something seemed a little off about 

this gentleman. All I remember about him is dark, shaggy hair, his

 slumped posture, and more than a weeks growth of uneven beard. 

She set his things down, politely smiled and said she would be back in a jiff to take his order. 

My mother, who happened to be standing at the till, was eying this 

stranger with an unsettling intensity. My mom, in all the things she's 

done in her life, was a Correctional Officer at a prison for a number of years. She instinctively knew how to spot trouble. She was very 

wary. As I walked by with an armful of dirty dishes, she squeezed my

 shoulder and told me to go take a break. We weren't particularly 

busy at the time, but it was quite odd of her to ask me to take a

 break so early in the day. I started to politely protest, but she squeezed my shoulder a little harder this time, and looked me in the eyes with that "" Don't argue child"" look, that you just don't argue with. 
So I shrugged, dropped my dishes off with Jasper, our dishwasher, 

hung up my apron and went outside to check on Reggie. When I 

walked outside, I left the back door open, like I always do. She sat by

 the gate, fully at attention, with an anxious look in her eyes. I 

reached out to scratch her ears, which she normally loves, but today

 she took this almost stoically, looking past me and into the 

apartment like she wanted to come inside. I could not do that during

 business hours, unless it was raining, and we'd put up a baby gate 

on the threshold of the kitchen to keep her from trotting around. I 

talked to her for a minute or too, and turned to go back inside. She

 let out a whimpering growl, and tried to hop the chain-link gate after

 me. I shushed her and told her to stay put, and she reluctantly

 obeyed the command. Being a clever dog, she would have opened
 the gate herself. 

But since she had done this in the past, we had clipped a chain 

around the gate latch with a padlock, and even if she was intelligent,

 she didn't have thumbs to turn a key. I closed the door and she let 

out a pained howl, like she needed to come with me. I did not wish t
o anger my mother by letting Reggie roam free in our eatery, so I 

firmly closed the door and made my way outside. 15 minutes was long

 enough of a break, and it was nearing Noon, lunch rush was coming.

 As I approached the kitchen, I heard a commotion. I froze on the 

threshold, in mid-stride. Jasper had his back to me, and looked 

extremely tense. This was completely abnormal, as he was the sort of

 hippy type, and was incredibly laid back. I glanced around him, and 

saw the man from earlier standing in the middle of the seating area 

screaming at my sister. He was red-faced and completely belligerent, waving his hands threateningly, spit flying everywhere, as he loomed over my 13 year old sister. In a flash my mom was in between them, losing her calm establishment owner look. She had replaced this look seamlessly with the angry mother bear stance. Jasper, and our older sibling Taleah joined her as well, a wall of flesh blocking Seanna from danger. I watched, terrified, in silence. Taleah was an intimidating 16 year old, she often sparred with our mother, and her fellow officers for defense training practice. 
She also played a variety of sports, and despite her short stature, she was pure muscle. The man continued screaming, making absolutely no sense as to what he was so angry about. Quickly my mother subdued the gentleman, twisting his arm around behind his back, and marched him outside, pushing him across the street, to the gas station parking lot. He took a swing at her when she let go of his arm, and she subdued him yet again. I was scared for this man, belligerent as he was, for even attempting at hurting my mom. If she lost her temper with him, things would get deadly. She didn't fuck around with threats towards her children. 
He waved his hands in surrender, storming off down the street. I scampered away to the apartment before she spotted me, and quickly turned on the television, pretending to still be on my break. She came in, looking incredibly calm. She scanned the apartment reflexively, her danger bells still going off. 
""Lyssa, we're closing for the afternoon. Come help break down."" This was a command, not from my boss, but from my mother. These were two different people. I jumped up immediately and came out. Taleah and Jasper stood together, looking ashen, and drawn. Seanna was just barely calmed from hysterics. This is not an easy thing for her, she doesn't have the same temperament as my mother, Taleah and I. She's a very timid individual. 
We turned the signs, cleaned the grills, set up for dinner, and my mom hung a sign on the door saying "" Out until 5pm"" Everyone went about their jobs in silence, save for the radio playing. It was an eerie calm. Mom sat in the corner booth with my sister, who's sobs had died down to hiccups, as she explained the situation. It turns out, she had gone to take his order, and hadn't heard something he'd said. She'd politely begged his pardon and asked if he would please repeat what he'd said. He just went ballistic from there, pushing her with such a force she nearly fell, then just stood there screeching at her. 
We all calmed ourselves eventually, and reopened at 5 that night. Business resumed as usual, until around dusk. I saw him stalking down the street again. In this town, you can see the whole stretch of Main Street, from beginning to end. I tugged on my mothers sleeve as she walked by me, and she turned to look out the window where I pointed. She stiffened, as he approached the building. He didn't come in, he simply walked by. But, he turned around immediately, as my sister came by, and looked at her. She froze, and stared. His drawn, hungry face stared right at her, and he leered. He drew a filthy finger across his throat, with a significant gesture at my sister. My mother called the police immediately. The deputy( Carlos) responded, as he knew my mother well. They carted the man away, but since there is not proper holding cells in town they had to let him go with a warning. If he came near our family or restaurant, he would be taken to jail. 
We didn't see him again for the remainder of business hours, and soon let it go. Things happen sometimes, and we figured he'd be gone. Night fell, and we went about our business with cleaning up shutting down shop. At night, before we went to bed, one of us always had to take the dog on ""patrol"" as we called it. We would walk with Reggie through the entire restaurant, opening every door so she could look in. 
And I mean it when I say she insisted on checking out everything. We'd start in the apartment, and work our way out, opening doors for her so she could inspect. Tonight it was my turn so I followed behind her as she checked under every table and booth, in the bathroom stalls, hallways, and the entire front lobby of the establishment. When she was satisfied with her inspection, she'd lay by the door to the apartment, and we'd reward her effort with a piece of deli meat or the occasional hamburger patty if we had one leftover. Then, she'd pad off to the apartment and resume normal dog activity. We all went to bed around 10:30-11pm that night. 
My mom and I shared a bed, while Taleah had her own, and Seanna slept on the pull-out couch. During the summer, we left the doors open, and latched the screen door. One at the top, and one at the bottom. The top was a hook, and the bottom as a slide latch. Like I said earlier, Reggie was a very clever dog, and could figure out how to work things fast, so we doubled up on latches so she wouldn't go gallivanting around at night. 
We all quickly went to sleep, as we all generally woke at 4:30 in the morning to start prepping for breakfast when we opened at 5AM. Also, my mother was on Ambien for her sleeping issues, and she slept like a rock. Everything was fine, but I'd woken a couple times, to Reggie, letting out a hair raising low growl of warning. I figured a cat was outside, and she did not get along with them, so she was scaring them away from our door. I went back to sleep. What seemed to me like just minutes later, I jolt up out of bed to Reggie standing in the middle of the room, fur standing on end. 
I got up, just as my older sister rose from her bed to inspect the problem. It was hard to see, as the back alley had no street lights, and the room was dark. Taleah took a step away from her bed, and Reggie went ballistic, all in that same moment as I sat watching from my bed, confused. She let out a snarl that chills me to this day, fangs bared. I had never seen Reggie act this way before, she was always docile and gentle. Taleah calmly approaches her, and whispers,
""Reggie, what is the matter with you?"" in a hushed voice. My mother and other sister are stirring by this time, and mom is fighting her Ambien to wake. As soon as she said something, I hear a man curse under his breath,
""Shit!""as if frustrated by the progress of something. Reggie no longer holds back, and flies into what I could accurately describe as the scariest thing I've ever seen in my 20 years of life, and lunges full boar at the screen door. She's barking ferociously, snarling, and emanating noises that sounded like someone loosed Cerberus the Hellhound in our living space. She ripped through the screen in her rage, forcing her upper half through the mesh like it was paper. Now I heard him clearly, cursing and screaming at our dog. Everyone was awake now, scrambling for lights, and yelling at each other in confusion. Reg was caught by the midsection in the screen, and struggled so hard to break free she knocked one of the hinges loose. I heard a snapping noise, like a beartrap on bone, and the man scream. 
This set our docile family pet into a frothing frenzy. She would kill him, even if she had to drag the whole door with her to get him. I heard something drop, and the man cursing as he struggled to break free from the jaws of the fierce beast that was our Reggie. My mother reached the door in slow motion, kicking it open, and simultaneously cocking her pistol and taking aim. Somehow, she'd managed to grab Reggie's collar, and yank her back, and pass her off to my sister, who dragged her into the hallway and locked the door. I heard Reggie's outraged howl come immediately after Taleah locked her in, and it both frightened and comforted me at the same time. The man was gone in the black of the night, and Mom closed both apartment doors, locking them. She proceeded to the front of the cafe to call the police. 
In the morning light, we inspected the door's damage. The man from earlier in the day had come back for his revenge, and was weilding an intimidating looking knife. In his struggle with Reggie, had dropped it on the Welcome mat. He'd been trying to jimmy the pin from the screens hinges out of the hinging mechanism, and that sound was what alerted the dog. The police canvassed the neighborhood in the early light, and found a trail of blood from our backdoor heading a couple blocks West until it slowly grew to nothing. 
Police speculated the man was in a crouching position when Reggie busted through the screen door, and had probably bitten him in the shoulder or arm region. They kept a watch out for our would-be attacker, and they never found him. If we didn't have her, I'm sure we wouldn't be alive to this day. Sadly, when my sister married, she took Reggie with her to live out of town. She got out one day, and a hunter mistook her for an actual wild wolf, and shot her illegally. She was one of the best dogs we've ever had, and I owe her my life. I only wish she would have lived a happy full life she deserved, and got to live to watch over my niece and nephews.

1364839694.0	1bfpjc	Motel Window Creeper	multiplesifl	297	47	13	"Back in 1984, when I was practically still a baby, my parents were having a rough time making ends meet. Since my parents thought it would be a genius idea to have four kids with no savings to speak of, they couldn't afford an apartment so we had to move into a local motel with weekly rates. We lived there for about a year. My Dad was the only one working and my older sister was in second grade at the time so my Mom was stuck tending to three children all under the age of four for most of the day on her own. I don't remember living there since I was so young but I was told about the place more than once growing up, which I assume was as a reminder of how far we had come as a family.

One morning when Dad was getting ready for work and Mom got my older sister ready for school, Mom noticed a shadow of a man against the pulled curtains of the bedroom. My Mom is a notorious scaredy cat so she hustled my sister toward the bathroom (where Dad was) and hissed ""There's someone outside the window!"" My Dad kinda rolled his eyes at her but looked out toward the front anyway to see if he could see anything. When he saw the shadow, his attitude changed. He snuck quietly but quickly across the room and opened the door. The man who had been standing outside the window immediately turned and ran off away from the motel into the street blindly. My Dad narrowed his eyes at his retreating back and closed the door, figuring if the guy was violent he would have started some shit instead of running away. He advised Mom to keep the curtains closed over the window for the day and to stay home with the door locked until he got home later, in case the guy came back. My Mom didn't want my Dad to leave but Dad reminded her that he had to or else he wouldn't get paid for the day, so Mom reluctantly agreed and sent Dad and sister on their way.

Later that afternoon, I was being an annoying little crybaby, so Mom instructed my older brother to play quietly with my younger sister and watch Sesame Street while she tried to soothe me into a nap on the couch. My Mom was sitting on the couch, patting my back while I bawled for no reason when she glanced at the front window to see if there was anyone standing there. Sure enough, there was! My Mom freaked out, snatched me up from the couch (which caused me to cry harder than I already was. God, I was such a shitty baby!) and locked the three of us in the bathroom so she could call Dad at work and then locked herself in with us. My Dad skipped out of work and ran back home. 

When he got there, the guy was still standing at our window, with his hands cupped around his face like he was trying to get a better look through the gap in the curtains. My Dad didn't even give the guy warning, he just punched him in the head as soon as he got close enough. The guy stumbled away from the window in a daze and Dad slapped him around, all the while yelling things like ""You think it's okay to scare people? You think it's okay to scare my wife and my kids? I'll show you what happens to fuckers that creep around windows!"" My Dad hit him a few more times before the motel manager showed up and stopped him, thinking my Dad was just beating up some random guy. The window creeper got away during the confusion. He never came back."	t5_2t3t8	True
1331868474.0	qyvhj	Why my younger brother will never know his father.	insomniaSAH	282	35	43	"**back story:** 

A couple years back, my stepdad's brother proposed to a woman who took the ring he bought her (HUGE rock - got it through a family friend who brokers jewels) and ran to Florida. She returned a few months later with a baby, which she said was his, and that she hadn't realized she was pregnant when she left. She was scared, because 

1) She didn't want to raise a kid alone - I later found out that she had already lost 3 children to CPS for abuse and neglect.

2) She was doubly scared that the child would be messed up and more work to raise, because she'd been drinking, smoking and who-knows-what-else the whole time she was pregnant.

He was apparently desperate for a family, given that his first two kids by his first... woman? Partner? (They never married) won't talk to him because he's an alcoholic waste who couldn't hold a job, so he took her back and they got married. This child spent pretty much every day alone in it's crib, sitting in his own filth, in the dark, given a bottle every few hours, and little to no attention or stimulation otherwise. The house was almost literally a shack, with a huge open hole into the foundation (about 10' across, and 10' down, with exposed pipes) and no guardrails around, an active road on one side of the 30' yard, and a good 10'+ (depending on season) drop into the water on the other, neither side with a fence. 

My uncle and his wife threw parties pretty much every night - drinking, smoking, occasionally people bringing meth and what not, and the police getting called ALL THE TIME. However, because the family's long and historied relationship with the police, he was not really held accountable for things. The cops watched him like a hawk - but they never got into serious trouble.

**The main story**

Well, one night, uncle and his wife got pulled over for weaving all over the road: she was in the driver's seat, he was in the passenger seat, holding the child in his lap. There was no car seat. Both were hammered, but my uncle had somehow gotten it into his head that because *she didn't have a license* that she would get in less trouble if they got caught. The first thing he did when he sobered up was to call our house in a panic, begging us to volunteer to take his son if CPS took him away, so that he'd still be able to be in his kid's life and not just lose him to the foster system. After much discussion, mom/stepdad said yes, and took the then just-over-one-year-old in. He screamed for hours on end, followed by silent, almost catatonic fits. He wouldn't make eye contact. He refused to be held, especially when fed - he would yank on the bottle until he could hold it himself. He was unable to keep formula down, and later, had an issue with food. (we found out after much work that it was a nervous reflex, and he's over it now.) 

Uncle got visitation rights, but wife signed away rights to parenthood: she was was leaving my uncle, and apparently wasn't interested in staying if they didn't have a child together. Uncle visited at least once a week, usually in the company of a friend, and both would reek of alcohol. He played rough with his son, dropped him on his head (twice) despite my mom's desperate pleas to be more gentle, and repeatedly harassed my mother by following her in public at a distance to keep an eye on his kid (he didn't live in the area and had to drive out to do this). 

I was alone at home with the child one night, and heard someone pull up in the driveway. Looking out the window, I saw a gray truck I didn't recognize idling in the driveway. A man in a baseball cap was sitting in the driver's seat, just staring at the house. I ran downstairs and locked the doors, both front and back, and kept the phone nearby. There'd been talks of my Uncle losing his right to visitation because of how he'd been treating my mom, and he'd threatened to send friends to the house to keep an eye out in his place. The truck left, and I told my mom when she got home. 

This sort of tension went on for months - including a particularly uncomfortable night when he and the friend came to a church event, and the friend (late 40's, missing teeth, filthy and smelling like stale beer) wouldn't stop staring at me/flirting/telling me I was very mature for my age - and he began showing up regularly with one friend over all the others. The big shock came when, early one morning, the caseworker - who had become somehow enamored with my uncle and didn't believe any of the stuff we told her - called, frantically apologizing. My uncle was on the news. He and the friend he'd been bringing over had just been arrested: apparently he'd kidnapped an older woman, stripped her, and had been keeping her as a sexslave at his house for several weeks, with the friend living with him. A friend from out of state had visited, and they had offered her to him for money - he waited a week before reporting them, but the cops finally had a solid reason with tons of evidence to come down on him. He'd been keeping the woman drugged and drunk, beating her, hiding clothes, keeping her chained up in a backroom, and threatening to kidnap and do the same to her teenage daughter if she called for help or tried to escape. Both he and his friend are currently in prison, and my adopted brother - now bright-eyed, excitable, and nothing like the cold and inhuman child that originally came to my mother's home - will be 4 years old in April.

**TLDR: My uncle brought his friend over to the house all the time to visit his child which we were fostering after the cops caught him and his ex-wife driving with the baby, both drunk. After several months of weird behavior and creepy events, my uncle was discovered as keeping a kidnapped woman as a sex-slave at his house, and is now in prison, and I have an adopted baby brother who's going to have the most startling revelation ever one day that his blonde-hair and blue-eyes don't quite match up with his Korean mother's features.**"	t5_2t3t8	True
1372806903.0	1hj3td	The Scariest Sleepover of My Life, or, The Rutland Rapist	elfinette	283	34	39	"I've been debating with myself about sharing this one, mostly because I want to protect my then-best friend's anonymity. I decided to carefully avoid identifying her and go for it.

It was summer of 2007. I was sixteen at the time, and I had a bad habit of crawling out of my bedroom window and going for long walks in the middle of the night. I was pretty fearless by nature, but that summer even I was getting nervous. There was a story going around of a guy in my neighbourhood (not the best part of town, if you know what I mean) attacking young women. The tale went that he would find them on a bus or at a bus stop, follow them until they were alone and then sexually assault them. I thought it was just a rumour, a rumour that persisted all summer and seemed to grow more elaborate and wild rather than fading with time.

On the second day of school rumour became fact the police liaison for our high school held an assembly for all of the female students. She told us that there was a man who was targeting young women, particularly petite girls, and that while no one had been raped, a few had been assaulted but managed to get away. She told us to be safe and to never walk alone, especially at night. I didn't listen. Like an irresponsible teenager I continued with my late night adventures like I was invincible. 

At the time my then-best friend was dating a guy who really creeped me out. At the time I was casually dating a less-than-stellar guy myself, so I really felt like I couldn't judge. But this guy was something else. Every time I had ever encountered or spoken with him my internal radar went off. He seemed like an average, laid-back kind of guy, maybe a little unmotivated, but an okay person. At the time I couldn't figure out what it was that raised red flags for me, but I suspect it was his body language- that subtle communication that can give away so much.

My friend and I had been growing slowly apart through high school. When she invited me for a sleepover just after Hallowe'en I thought it'd be fun. We could watch a Disney movie and eat timbits! It'd be great! When I arrived I was suddenly doubtful. When I accepted the invitation I didn't know that her boyfriend had moved temporarily into her house. There were two bedroom upstairs. Boyfriend was staying in the room beside my best friend's. I thought it was a weird situation, and I didn't really want to hang around him, but I loved my friend, so I stayed.

Throughout the evening the boyfriend would make little comments here and there, just inappropriate enough for me to shoot him a dirty look but not bad enough for me to risk rocking the boat by calling him on it. Finally my friend put her foot down when, as boyfriend was carrying the TV into her room so we could watch a VHS, he suggested ""jokingly"" that we could have a threesome. My friend kicked him out of her room and told him to stop being gross. I was suddenly on edge. I didn't like the way he was looking at me as he left.

I was so lost in my own thoughts I hardly remember the movie. The movie ended around midnight and my friend fell asleep before it was over. I turned off the television and flopped onto the mattress, but I couldn't sleep. A very strange thought was forming in my head. The guy stalking and assaulting women- his physical description matched boyfriend's. Stalker guy's MO was to go after small young women- both my friend and I were short and slim. I knew that boyfriend had been in my neighbourhood around the time of the attacks- I had seen him at a bus stop once on one of my midnight walks.

I told myself that I was just being paranoid- and yet, I couldn't drop the idea. After about an hour of lying in the dark I was just drifting off to sleep when I heard the door slowly begin to open. The room was set up with two mattresses on the floor, my friend on the one closest to the window, mine so near to the door that if I reached out my leg I could close it. The door only opened a crack before I reacted- on instinct I stretched out my leg and pushed against the door, quickly shutting it.

My heart was beating so fast as my brain whirred through the scenario. Was it a burglar? No, I hadn't heard anyone coming up the stairs. It had to be the boyfriend. I waited quietly for a moment, to see if boyfriend would say anything or knock. Maybe he wanted the television back? He didn't say anything, just tried the door again. And again. I scooched further down the mattress to put both of my feet against the door.

It was as if he couldn't quite decide what he wanted to do. He would try the door once or twice, walk quietly back to his room, wait a minute, then come back to try the door again. The door had no lock, so if I didn't keep my legs against the door he could open it easily. I wasn't sure what to do, so I just kept doing what I was doing. Finally, after about thirty minutes of silently trying the door, he went back to his room. I didn't hear anything else after, so I think he fell asleep. For obvious reasons, I didn't sleep that night- I just kept my feet against the door and tried to figure out what I would say to my friend.

I had somewhere to be early the next morning, and my ride came at six, so when I snuck out my friend was still fast asleep. I left a note for her to call me asap. Later in the day I called the police non-emergency line and spoke to an officer. I told her that I didn't have a lot to go on, mostly intuition, but that I had a tip about the guy assaulting women in my neighbourhood. The officer thanked me for the tip and reminded me to stay safe. For once I listened: I didn't go on any nighttime walks for the next little while.

Soon after, and before I got a chance to talk to my friend again (I think she may have been avoiding me, because I knew she was around but she never did call me) my friend's boyfriend was arrested. He had been the one after all, the guy sexually assaulting women. I guess the police were already suspicious of him, so when his DNA was matched to the last assault scene, he was caught. It was a terrible thing to go through but my friend was really brave and she even worked with the police to get justice for the victims.

The boyfriend pleaded guilty to six counts of sexual assault and three counts of sexual assault causing bodily harm in May 2009. He was sentenced to five years in prison and to be listed on the sex offender registry for twenty years. You can see two articles about him here:

1375676164.0	1jpyr6	Ten years wasn't long enough	blarnsenfargle	305	57	78	"First of all, I would like to apologize for the throw-away.  My main account has things like local subreddits that could be used for identification, and all things considered, it’s probably a good idea that this stays safely anonymous.


Things started about a decade ago.  I was either a sophomore or junior in high school and was one of those that was picked on a lot.  Mostly because I really didn’t make an effort to be too friendly.  After all, I had just gone through the traumatic sudden loss of my father, and didn’t want to be nice. However, I did make a few friends.  One of them was this guy in my art class.  Shy, socially-awkward, soft-spoken, but generally okay.  We bonded over anime and video games and everything seemed cool.


School ended for the year, we didn’t really talk over the summer as I was busy avoiding the world, aside from my internet friends. Didn’t really think much of it, I’ve never been too social.


End of summer, school starts again.  


Apparently my absence during our time off had bothered him.  He was suddenly very clingy, didn’t want me to talk to anyone except him, and just starting to act creepy.  He’d shower me in gifts-- though several I refused, and really, as a teenaged girl who didn’t know any better, I was pretty flattered by all of the attention.


The flattered feeling ended when he’d start showing up at all of my rehearsals for the school play.  He’d show up at every art club meeting, where he never had before.  And, the kicker, he’d randomly be at my house.


Not knocking on the door, asking to see me, but just sitting in his car, a house or two down.  Pretty sure I heard him outside my window, but never had any proof.  


I never told my mom, even though that would have been the smart thing to do.  However, I did tell two of my teachers, and they took action.  I don’t know any of the details, but I do know that the boy quit school and was banned from the campus.  Things are cool now, yeah?  Didn’t see him again and rumors spread around that the police had gotten involved.  I personally didn’t (and still don’t) believe those, because I was never contacted by law enforcement.


Happy ending, right?  Dude doesn’t talk to me anymore, and I don’t see him again.  The only thing that happens is a friend links me to his livejournal a few years later when I’m in college, where he’s vaguely threatening.  But I’m hours away and think nothing of it.


In fact, I think nothing of it for several years.  He’s not even a blip on my radar anymore. 


But things are never that simple, are they?


Keep in mind that we’re over a decade away from our initial meeting now.  I’m back in my hometown, and working at our absolutely tiny rural emergency room as a receptionist.  Nothing glamorous, but it’s a job and helps pay the bills.  Just something to do until I figure out what I’m going to be when I grow up!


So one evening as I get into work, I take a look at the current patient list.  Blah blah toothache, blah blah sore throat, blah blah stubbed toe.  ...Like I said, rural emergency room and we hardly ever have a real emergency.  One of the patients did have something wrong with her though, and it looked like she was going to be admitted to our hospital.


While I’m catching up on this and other assorted things, my coworker that I’m taking over for buzzes a guy back into the ER itself.  I look up and do a double-take.  This big guy...bearded, wearing a heavy metal band shirt (Not that such a thing means anything, I’m pretty fond of metal myself) and a fucking fedora is standing there.


And he glanced at me with the most hate-filled, disgusted look I have ever been given.  Soulless eyes that had nothing but anger behind them, and a sneer that would make a baby cry. Now, I’m used to getting dirty looks in my job, and I’ve even been threatened before because a doctor wouldn’t give out narcotics to a seeker.  This is nothing unusual for me...but that look was unlike any other.  This wasn’t some stoned-out asshole, this was something personal.


At this point, keep in mind, I have no idea who he is.  I think I just stared dumbly at him and my coworker mentioned something about that “being weird” but she didn’t say anything else about it, and let me take over.  Once again I looked over the patient list and one of the names finally looks vaguely familiar.  I looked at the paperwork, and there it was, under emergency contact.  His name.


It was nothing like getting hit with a ton of bricks.  It was more like a cold wave soaking me.  My breath caught in my throat and my chest tightened.  In fact, I might have said “fuck” out loud, though I really don’t remember.  I certainly did think it though.


Quietly I let my nurses know what’s going on.  Since he hadn’t said anything or actually done anything, there was nothing we could do but keep an eye on him.  He remained in his family members room until she was admitted, and as he left, he stopped at my desk.


Now, in my job, I have to be polite and happy and sympathetic and such.  So I smiled and asked if he needed anything, and he just snarled out, jabbing his finger at my chest across the desk.


“I will be seeing YOU later, chicka.”


Yeah, that was a chills down the spine moment.  I wish I could say I had a great comeback, that I was witty and smart and badass, but all I could manage was something like a squeak and a cringe backward.  SO HEROIC.


Ahem.  Anyway, he left for the night and I was a bit shaken up.  Managed to get through my shift without incident for the most part, until the very end.


As morning came, via the camera at my desk I saw him come in to visit his family member about ten minutes before the end of shift. That’s fine, to get to our acute care floor he doesn’t need to come near me.  ...then about two minutes later, I see him leave again.  Not enough time to actually visit, and already creeped out enough, I asked a few of our surprisingly awake paramedics (they’re usually asleep around this time) to escort me to my car when my relief got there.


They did so without question, walking me out of the building and into the parking lot.  There we saw my ‘friend’ sitting in his car, waiting near the employee parking lot.  Visitor’s lot?  Other side of the hospital.


My paramedic friends walked me to my car, but as added insurance against him following me home, decided that this was the perfect time to get gas for the trucks.  So they hurried back to the ambulance bay and followed me as I drove off. 


It’s a little difficult, on curvy roads, to pass an ambulance.  Just saying.


He gave up, turned around and went back to the hospital, and I was home free.  My next shift I profusely thanked my coworkers for being awesome, and also reported this to my boss and administration.  


They did nothing but say “If he comes again, you can call the sheriff but only if he threatens you.”


Yeeeeah, I really need to get out of here and figure out what I’m going to be when I grow up.


I haven’t seen him since, but believe me, I’m waiting.  While he knows where I work, he doesn’t know where I live, or my married name, so chances are I’d only see him in the ER, or maybe at the store or something. Always a public place.

1353137793.0	13cdxu	"""Oh god, it was you."""		296	51	106	"It was 2011, I was seventeen at the time, and a senior in high school. It was spring break and some friends and I decided to take a little mini-road trip to go camping about two hours away. 

It's probably safe to say that I have an Internet addiction (despite this being my first post on reddit), so it is hard for me to go only an hour without checking my social networking sites.

I checked Facebook on our drive out to the site, and I had a friend request and a message from a guy I didn't know. We had mutual friends so he obviously lived in the area, but the message he sent me read something like, ""Hey, I wish I knew somebody like you when I was in high school. We have a lot of the same interests, and you're pretty cute.""

After checking out his page, I realized we had a few things in common like loving bands like The Dead Weather and playing Batman: Arkham Asylum. He wasn't my type though, so I politely replied with just, ""Haha, thanks!"" 

He replied again later, trying to continue the conversation despite the fact that I clearly wasn't trying to help further it on. He sent me about three more messages, and I replied to none of them. Eventually, he sent me another along the lines of, ""Okay, I don't usually do this. But I was wondering if I could take you out on a date sometime?""
I was flattered, but I don't date. And the fact that this guy had somehow become so interested in me after I said two words to him kind of unnerved me. ""Sorry, I'm sort of talking to somebody,"" was all I could think of as a reply. 

Even though I denied his friend request, his profile was still public. A few hours after rejecting him, I decided to glance through his statuses to see if he seemed like somebody I'd be interested in. He wasn't. His most recent status, posted about ten minutes after I sent my rejection, read: ""Girl I like rejected me... crying like a bitch."" Like, WHAT?! Homeboy, I don't know you!!!

So, I was completely shocked by the whole thing and decided to post it all on my Tumblr, but leaving out his name. Keep in mind: I had my Facebook for my real life friends from school, and I didn't want them to know about my blog. So there's no link to it. I also have it disabled on Tumblr to look me up by my email address. 

I get another message from him that says, ""Okay. That wasn't nice. I found your blog and saw your post, and I'd appreciate it if you took it down or got to know me."" I opted for taking the post down, hoping that'd be the end of it. It was not. 

ANOTHER MESSAGE about a day later. ""Why didn't anybody tell me the girl from The Dead Weather was in The Kills?!?!?! you like The Kills right? Their new CD is coming out soon, I could buy it for you. And I looked at their tour dates and they're playing here in like a month!""
If he was trying to win me over, it was actually making me hate him. I took pride in bands that I love, and I wasn't going to have some random dude buy me my favorite band's upcoming album. And the fact that he felt the need to tell me they were coming to our city? What kind of fan did he think I was?

I ignored the message and prayed to god that he wasn't going to show up at the concert too. 

Skip ahead a few weeks, and the concert was over. They were perfect and I got to meet them; just in case you were wondering although you probably weren't. I'm just sitting on the couch, blogging, when I get a message from somebody that I don't follow on tumblr. All it says is, ""Oh god, it was you."" Huh? I go to their blog, and oh god, it was him. 

And the first post is about what a great time he had at the concert last night. And there's a part that chilled me to the bone... He talked about a cute, tall, redheaded woman in front of him and how she knew all of the lyrics and sang along and how he wish he had the courage to go up to her and ask her for her number or ask her out on a date. But I'm a redhead. I'm 5'11. I wear glasses. 

He was behind me the whole night, fucking watching me!

I immediately blocked him. How is he not getting my signals? 

I went without hearing from him for about a month, but I started getting anonymous messages on tumblr about how I'm cute and how the anon wishes they could be my friend, but I probably hate them. After asking them to reveal themselves, I get a message from him on Facebook. ""It's me."" Oh, lord. 

He's blocked on Facebook now, too. I wouldn't be surprised if he found this since he's found all of my other accounts.

1343771481.0	xgz6p	A Phone Call	fromjonas	297	50	68	"Hey, everyone. This only happened last night. I'm nervous typing this, because I'm still a little unnerved by the whole thing (as I'm sure you all have been yourselves once or twice if you've been posting here).
So anyway, it was around two in the morning and I was watching Breaking Bad on Netflix. My house phone ran so I paused and went to answer it. Since I have caller ID, I usually just answer the phone informally, depending on who it is. I had suspected that it would be my friend Paul, who's made a habit of calling whenever he damn pleases. But I picked up the phone and saw that it said 'Unavailable'. I answered with 'Hello?' of course, taking the chance that it could be someone who wouldn't take 'sup, bitch' as very nice. There was nothing in return. The line was silent for a little bit, then all I heard was an automated voice saying 'goodbye'. Then the line went dead. Normally, I would guess that it could have been a telemarketer, but the 'goodbye' had sounded like the phone was being held up to a speaker, and I could swear I heard low breathing during the quiet. Being as paranoid as I am, I was a bit disturbed by this and looked out some of my windows. I shut the drapes on my glass door to the back yard (which I always hated) and went back to my room and resumed watching Netflix.
Near the end of the episode, my front door was knocked on. I jumped out of my seat and nearly shit my pants, on the count of it having been nearly 3 in the morning. Nobody could have been visiting me at the time, so I sneaked into the guest room and looked out the window. In the driveway was a car I had never seen, and the in the driver's seat was a guy with a mask on. This, already made me want to panic, but I also looked at my door and saw another masked guy was waiting. There was a rifle my dad owned under the guest bed that I took out and loaded, but I was too freaked out to answer the door. Plus, I was trembling too much to actually aim. So, I used the phone by the bedside to call the police. They told me to stay were I was. It was fucking uncanny what happened next. It took about thirty seconds for the ski mask guy to just turn around and get back in the car. He looked like he was rushing, too. The two guys drove off and the police arrived a bit later. I put my gun back and answered some questions and eventually the officers left. I tried watching Netflix again after that, but I had to have the lights on, and I couldn't sleep at all. I didn't even want to leave my room.

tl;dr: Two guys showed up at my house late at night after I got a hangup call from an unidentified number.

1372014837.0	1gx7gp	Always grateful for my Creep-dar	murryum	277	29	13	"My family has lived right across the street from an elementary school my entire life. We had on-tracks and off-tracks because our area had too many kids to keep them all in school at the same time. 

One day (I was 9 at the time) I was off-track but I saw all my friends playing out at recess and we were throwing kickballs back and forth across the street from each other. We kept having to stop throwing the ball because one car would pass by over and over. Finally, when all the kids went in after recess, the car slowed down right in front of me and asked me if I needed a ride anywhere. I told him no I was okay. He asked me if I needed any help. I, again, told him no. He asked where I lived so he could take me home and thankfully my 9-year-old brain was smart enough to leave out the fact that I was sitting right in front of my house and I told him my mom was close by. 

By this time he started getting frustrated and he told me he didn't think he should leave me alone and that I should get in his car until someone shows up. I told him I didn't need to because my house was nearby. He then tried the very-cliche tactic of getting me in his car because he had candy. I told him I had candy at home. He started getting out of his car and I SCREAMED AS LOUD AS I COULD. He hurriedly got back in his car and I heard his tires screech as he tried to speed away.

As soon as he was out of sight I ran into my house and told my mom, who immediately called the cops. When the cops got to my house they asked me to describe the car and driver as best as I could. I told them everything I could remember and they left.

A couple days later my mom got a call asking if I could come down to the station and talk to a detective. When we got there I told him everything all over again. They took a rough sketch and sent us on our way. I didn't hear anything else until I was about 16 when my mom told me that the cops called her a couple days after that and told her that the person I saw had kidnapped, raped, and murdered 4 little girls in my area. They finally caught up to him, but he had already killed himself.

I always wondered why, after this, my mom wouldn't let me play outside without one of my 6 older siblings."	t5_2t3t8	True
1369881907.0	1fb9d1	Awareness...make sure your kids have it.	zombie_vader	283	38	38	"In 2010 I was living with my wife in a decent apartment complex on a decent side of San Antonio, Texas.  As I was turning into the apartment complex I had to stop because a group of girls in their early teens and some older guys were standing there talking. They finally get out of the way and I head inside to start enjoying my Friday night only to discover I am out of beer.  I make a run to the nearby gas station and as I get back to the apartment I see the group of kids has headed to the pool. Well good I think because at least they aren't blocking the damn driveway. 

I head out to my patio to enjoy a beer and smoke and I am amazed at the language and topics the kids are using.  I was 28 at the time and enjoy cussing more than I should but not when I was that age.   I notice that one of the guys voices is deep. Not Barry White deep but grown ass man deep.  Our apartment is right next to the pool on the first floor so I decide to take a look. 

All the girls are from the surrounding buildings but I don't recognize either one of the two guys that are talking to them. I do recognize that these ARE grown ass men talking two little girls who clearly have no idea how stupid they are being talking about blowjobs and their bra sizes. 

I go inside to take my dog for a walk aka bathroom break and to get a good look at these guys because for whatever reason my adrenaline is starting to flow and I have this overwhelming sense that shit is not right.  In the minute it took me to put the dog on a leash they are gone from the pool area.  I walk towards the office and the front of the complex where I had initially seen the group. Sure enough there they were saying their goodbyes. 

So as the girls turn to walk back to their building they are completely oblivious to the fact that the guys have gotten back out of their care and are following them about 30 feet behind them. I have no idea what comes over me and I shout at the guys ""why are you following my sister man?""  They look at me (I am not at all intimidating looking especially with a dachshund on a leash) and keep walking after the girls. I start walking towards them with pace and yell again ""what the fuck man! Why you following little girls?""

They turn and bolt at the same moment the apartment manager comes trotting out of the office asking questions about what happened. Apparently these guys were known in the area and were not allowed near the apartments or children. She never said why but I assume because of crimes against minors because a cop came knocking on my door within the hour to take a statement from me.  

When my wife got home and heard this she marched over to the apartments of the girls and talked to their moms about it and none of them seemed too interested or even that they believed my wife. The next afternoon there was a letter on every door about the two guys and the incident that had happened. 

TL:DR- spider sense went off and I possibly saved some girls from harm because they didn't know they were being followed. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1369632538.0	1f4fpa	How I outsmarted a creeper	TheHighC	291	43	38	"Not sure if this is the right place, but whatever.

In 7th grade I would always stay home. My mom would always tell me don't answer the door, phone whatever. I never listened. Always did.

We lived in a split level house with a basement and a main floor, btw.

One day, a shady lookin guy walked up to my door while i was home alone. This guy had nothing to sell, no uniform, just an old coat and fucked up hair, looking like he hadn't shaved in awhile. I always would open it, being a stupid little kid, because it was always the UPS or whatever dropping off medicine. Well something about this guy told me not to answer it. So I opened the main door, keeping the glass one locked. I asked what he needed. Here's the conversation:

Me: ""What do you need?""
Him: ""I need to use a phone, is your mom home?""
Me: ""Yeah but she's upstairs taking a shower.""
Him: ""Oh. Is your dad home?""
Me: ""Yeah..but he's downstairs cleaning his gun.""
*at this point his eyes got huge and wide*
Him: ""OH. Okay..uh..I'll be back then..""

He walked a lot faster down the driveway and never came back lol."	t5_2t3t8	True
1359417104.0	17glqd	Davie	elfinette	290	42	48	"This is the third creeper story from my first year of high school, grade ten. I still feel a lot of shame and embarrassment about this incident, but I want to get it out there. Warning: super long.




Davie was the kind of guy that thinks he is very clever and cuttingly sarcastic, but really just like a jerk ninety percent of the time. The other ten percent of the time his energy was concentrated on getting into some girl's pants. He had a talent, even at sixteen, for telling girls what they wanted to hear.

Emma was my friend. She was sweet, with a contagious laugh, long auburn hair and freckles. Seriously adorable, and seriously naive. She wasn't the sharpest crayon in the box either, but her good nature and sense of humor made her well-liked.

One Wednesday night in July, Emma and I were at youth group. Davie and his friend Aaron showed up. Davie introduced himself to Emma and immediately went to work. He complimented her hair and her blue eyes, and by the end of the evening he told Emma that he had ""never felt this way about any girl before"". Emma believed every word. They kissed as Davie got off the bus and made plans to see each other on Friday.

Emma was almost unbearable to talk to for the next two days. All she would talk about was Davie, which I guess is normal teen girl behavior. He had given Emma his black leather jacket to hold on to until their date. She wore it constantly. I did try to caution her very gently on Davie's track record, but she was smitten. When Friday finally dawned, I went over to Emma's in the afternoon to braid her hair and lend some ""emotional support"" before her first date.

In a neighborhood near ours there was a small park. It had trees and wetland all around it, and the only way to get to the park was by going down an outdoor concrete staircase. When Emma admitted that's where she was meeting Davie, alarm bells went off. At first she was hurt that I thought something was up and wouldn't talk about it. In the end all I could do was manage to convince her that a double date would be fun. I called Davie and asked if his friend Aaron was single and willing to be my counterpart in a double date. I figured that, if I had to take one for the team to keep Emma safe, then so be it. Aaron said yes.

We met in the evening at the park. Aaron seemed like an okay kid, quieter and nicer than Davie. While Aaron and I alternated between talking about cartoons from the 90s and awkward silence, Emma and Davie made out. By the time the sun began to set I was getting bored. Aaron asked me if I'd like to be pushed on a nearby swing set. I said sure. Apparently Davie and Emma had a lover's quarrel while we were gone, because when we got back Davie was wearing his jacket again and no one was speaking. I asked Emma if she wanted to leave and she tearfully said yes.

We said goodbye to the guys (Davie was sulking) and began to walk home. Emma explained that Davie had made a sexual comment that embarrassed her, and that when she asked him not to talk like that, he got angry. When we had just reached the bottom of the concrete staircase, Davie caught up to us. He told Emma he was really sorry and asked her to come back. He said that Aaron had some coolers and glowsticks in his backpack and that we could have a cool party if we stuck around.

Emma and I had an argument then. I can't remember the details, but I thought that sticking around was a bad idea and Emma really wanted to stay. When Emma wouldn't budge I said fine, have it your way, I'm going home. Emma went back to hang out with Aaron and Davie and I made my way up the stairs.

I stopped at the top of the stairs and sat down. I was stubborn but I didn't want to leave Emma alone. From where I was sitting I could see the three of them, so I settled in to watch like a stalker. It got darker a lot cooler. After a while spent daydreaming I realized I couldn't see them anymore. I stood up, and was thinking about going to get Emma when I heard her scream.

I ran like the wind down the stairs and across the field. When I reached the three of them I found Emma pressed up against the side of the jungle gym, held in place by Aaron while Davie was trying to take her shorts off. Davie was laughing and Emma was trying to kick her legs and crying.

I grabbed Aaron first and pulled him off of her. He offered no resistance, and, once he realized what was about to happen, he actually ran away. I then turned to Davie who, remarkably, knew I was there and was still trying to undress Emma. I jumped him. We ended up wrestling in the pea gravel, me going for his eyes and his throat in a rage, him laughing as if it were a great game. He was much larger than fifteen-year-old me, but as he was laughing and trying to hold me down I managed to get a good punch in to his throat.

While he was gasping for air I got on top of him broke his arm. I didn't mean to- I'm not actually sure how it happened, but I remember him lying on the ground, my combat boot coming in contact with his arm and the sound of his forearm snapping. I remember realizing that his arm was broken and that he would need to go to the hospital. I felt such a deep shame and regret in that moment. But I also felt a lot of anger. Instead of doing the humane thing, I kicked him in the stomach and yelled that if he ever touched Emma again, or if he tried anything with any other girl, I would break his other arm. Then I grabbed Emma and we ran like we had just committed a crime, which I guess I just had.

Emma cried a lot. She cried, and then she tried to kiss me, and then she cried some more. It was a confusing night for everyone. I had her stay over at my house and I talked to her about reporting Davie. I even dialed the police and put the phone in her hand, but she wouldn't do it and begged me not to. Her parents were pretty severely abusive (I had called social services twice on them when we were younger) and she was terrified of her parents finding out what had happened and punishing her for it. So, I did the stupid thing and I didn't tell anyone.

Davie walked around with a neon pink cast for the rest of the summer. He acted very proud of it and told everyone that he got hit by a car while rollerblading at night. My best friend ended up dating a friend of Davie's, so I would see him every once in a while outside a theatre or at a party. He would always put on a neutral face and quickly walk away, and I would try to not kick the back of his head.

1339345126.0	uupkm	The Indian Kid	Augykins	284	43	41	"Ohai Reddit, this is the creepiest thing that's ever happened to me, and it happened a day after I stumbled upon this subreddit. Also, I created this account only to post this. (Sorry for any grammatical errors in advance)

It was a Friday morning. The day before, school ended for me and I decided that, just for the hell of it, I would stay up until 3:00 on reddit. The last subreddit I was on before going to sleep was this one.

I woke up feeling strange, about five minutes before it happened. My eight year old sister was asleep and both my parents were running errands. I get out of bed and brush my teeth. Right as I finish, the doorbell rings. I go downstairs and open the door only to find this small Indian Kid, no older than six years old, with a demented look on his face. He has two little toys, one in each hand. I ask him whats wrong but instead he just tries to push past me into the house. I gently nudge him back outside, but he keeps trying to come in. So, not knowing what to do, I just close the door on him.

The doorbell starts ringing again. I ignore it for three minutes, but it keeps ringing, so I open the door again. The second the door opens, the kid sprints into the house past me. He sits himself down in the kitchen and starts playing with the two toys he brought. I had no idea what the fuck I was supposed to do in this situation, so I just called the police.

While I waited for them to come, the kid is wandering around my house, turning light switches on and off, unlocking and re-locking various doors, and wandering into various rooms. The police finally came (this woke my sister up). They struggled to get the kid into their car to take him back to the station and find his parents. The police found the parents and got informed that the kid is EXTREMELY autistic and that the he's snuck out of his house before. 

Okay whatever, I told my parents, they talked to his parents, his parents were nice, everything was taken care of.

Lol no.

I went to bed at around 11, only to wake up due to a nightmare about the kid. That, and my brain was telling me that it was piss time. So I get out of bed and walk into the hallway. At the end of the dark hallway, I see the Indian kid walk upstairs with the same exact fucking toys in his hand. The second he sees me, he makes a strange moaning noise, I thought I saw him drop something, and he runs back downstairs. I hear the front-door close, and after waiting five minutes, I run downstairs, lock the door, run back up and realize I pissed myself.

When I awoke my parents, and told them what happened, they said it was all just a bad dream. In the morning, the phone rings. When I pick it up, the parents of the little Indian kid say that he wants to talk to me. He gets on the phone, it's the first time I ever heard him say anything to anyone. He asks me for the toy truck he dropped last night.

Everything creepy always happens in Florida...

1365443671.0	1bxihp	Glad we changed the locks...	harrisharrisharris	273	31	30	"When I was a student, I lived in a large house with five other girls. One of my housemates went home for the weekend. When she came back, she did so without her front door key. For reasons lost on me, her mother sends the key through the post, rather than just waiting for one of us to make a copy of our key for her. 

So. One of the keys to our house is winging its way through the standard (not special or recorded) post in an envelope with our address on it. Unsurprisingly, by the time it arrives, the envelope has been slit up the side and the key is gone. None of my other housemates shared my outrage at this - they didn't seem to think it was much of an issue. Meanwhile, I'm phoning the emergency locksmith and forking out the £120 to have the lock changed. 

Fast-forward a few weeks, and it's one-thirty on a Monday morning. My housemates are all asleep, but I've never slept well so I was still awake. My bedroom happened to be above the front door. Suddenly, I hear hushed voice and quiet footsteps coming from below my head. I peek out of the corner of the blind and freeze as I hear the unmistakeable sound of a key being tried in a lock, and only remember to breathe again when I see them walk back down our path, carefully open our gate, and close it behind them. 

Obviously, no harm befell us - but what's always scared me about this is how easy it would have been to have been complacent and just thought, 'Ah, it'll be fine' - and then suddenly found ourselves - six average, not self-defence-trained girls - in our house with a couple of men whose intentions would not have been tea-party-orientated. 

TL;DR - housemate's mum posted the key to our house... to our house. A couple of weeks later, two men try the key in the early hours of the morning. Luckily, we'd changed the locks!"	t5_2t3t8	True
1344314188.0	xt30q	"""I'm delivering packages."""	BlueSanctum18	291	49	73	"Hi, reddit :) first time poster here, lurked for a while but it was LetsNotMeet that really made me decide to create an account. It feels more personal to me here with everyone sharing their stories. This particular one of mine isn't far off from a lot of others I've seen on here, (not sure if that's good or bad... just means there's more creeps like this one.) but it's my first post since it is so recent in my memory. 

Anyway, on to the story. I live at home and my family and I live in a peaceful, private neighborhood. Or more just a street, really, but it's a gated community and we are pretty secluded up on a hill. Now, all you REALLY have to do if you want to get in but don't know the code is wait for someone to go through the gate before you. Some good that does security-wise, I know. But it's a very quiet community and everyone knows each other and gets along, so it's usually only the odd curious explorer or lost delivery guy. Oh, and 19 year old gal here by the way, in case there's curiosity.

Now, this happened a few weeks ago earlier in the summer. It was just a usual morning, with everyone else out at work or otherwise, myself taking advantage of the opportunity to sleep in. By about 10 I was up and just letting the dogs outside when I heard a knock at the door. We have a glass front door (I decidedly hate those now.) and I could see what certainly looked to be a delivery guy at the door. (And he could see I was home so I couldn't avoid answering. Glass doors gotta work both ways, I guess.) My mom's always ordering things, so I figured it was something I had to sign for or the guy would have just left it there and gone. I walk over and open the door, more concerned with the fact that I very obviously had just rolled out of bed more then anything. There in the doorway is a skinny, white guy of about 30 with sandy-ish hair wearing a brown uniform. Collared work shirt and matching brown pants, like UPS. However I notice there's no logo on the shirt. In fact, no letters, name, or writing whatsoever anywhere. Which was weird enough. By that point I've actually focused in on the guy himself, and that's when it got weird. This guy just instantly gave me the creeps. What I noticed first were his eyes, he didn't look.. normal, honestly. His eyes weren't meeting mine, and he took a moment to speak. When he did, I almost wanted to crawl out of my skin. He had this raspy, slow voice and sounded like he wasn't even paying attention to what he was saying. ""I'm here delivering packages"", he said. He looked behind me as he spoke, not at me. Through the doorway into the house. ""What's your name?"" I gave him our last name. ""Oh yeah, yeah! I think I've got a package for (Our last name). Is there someone else like your mom or dad here who can sign for this? I mean, if you're alone though.. I bet you could too."" He looked hopeful. He didn't even bother to ask how old I was. Also I believe for UPS you don't even need to be 18 to sign anyway. And normally, he'd produce a name and check to confirm it if anything. This guy was fishing. Definitely knowing something was off, but about to respond, that's when I noticed **this guy didn't have a package.** I froze. In fact, he didn't even have a clipboard or paper of any kind. But he did have a fanny pack on his belt. I knew that wasn't very unusual in itself, but I noticed it looked really out of place. It was beige, and didn't go with his ""uniform"" at all. In fact, the whole thing looked more like someone just trying to copy a UPS uniform. When he did meet my gaze, he looked at me like I was a piece of meat. Before he could notice me hesitate, I said, ""Oh yeah! My parents are both just asleep. I'll go get one of them to sign, they need to wake up anyway."" And that did it. That set something off in this guy's head. That's when he seemed to lose it. He started mumbling incoherently, muttering something like ""I've made a mistake, this is the wrong house.."" and stopped making eye contact completely. He was pacing a bit, as if fighting some internal battle over whether or not to stay. He completely dropped the act by now, and we both knew his story was totally unbelievable, but he didn't seem to care. He started walking away and I slammed the door and locked it. Then feeling a bit safer I watched through the window as he RAN out to the street, where I noticed a large, white, *unmarked* van. One of the ones with two big doors in the back with no windows on the sides. I wanted to get all the information I could about this guy, so as he BOOKS IT down the street I look at the van and get a chill. There's no plates. 

This was creepy enough, but the worst of it actually came after. I called my dad and told him about the creep, he said to lock all the doors until he got home. Once he did I gave him a full description and my dad looked really worried and I wasn't sure why. I mean, I hadn't been hurt and the guy was gone, so the threat was over right? As I said, our neighborhood's very close and most the neighbors are close family friends. My dad emailed them all a description of what had happened. I went about the day until dinner time when he told me he had something to tell me. He and my mom hadn't told me before so as to not freak me out.

Apparently a few months previously, the neighbors directly next to us also had an incident. They have 2 teenage girls, one a few years younger then myself. The youngest one had been home alone one day out by the pool when she looked inside and *saw someone walking inside their house.* Terrified, she had apparently gone around the side of the house into her room and hid, and called either the cops, her parents or both, (not sure of all the details) and waited while she saw this man walking around in the house. There are actually windows in some of the walls in the interior of their house, so she could see from her room into the kitchen, family room etc. He walked around, opening doors and looking in but apparently there was money and jewelry laying around that he could have easily taken. That wasn't what he was looking for. She ended up hiding out of sight until she heard the front door close, and went out to check if he'd gone. She saw him drive away and the car he left in. 

It was her mother who had replied to my dad's email. She gave a description of the man who had entered their home. He had been white, wearing a brown uniform, and *drove off in a white van*. Had I known about it before, I don't know if I'd have been able to be so calm about that guy talking to me at the door. We filed a report that day. The cop came to our house, and seemed convinced it was a would-be robber. I don't think so. Something was up with that guy. He was too socially awkward, he seemed like he didn't know how or didn't care to interact with other people. He looked way too pleased when I answered the door and when he saw the empty house inside. And he'd walked right past valuables laying out in the open when he'd entered the neighbors. And who knows what things could have been in that fanny pack. Or tools. I truly believe there are some people out there who are just not right. I'm so glad I didn't let him know I was home alone. Thanks for reading :)

1356530220.0	15guca	He was watching me from the field behind my house	ckincaid	289	44	32	"This story starts with my being assaulted in November 2011.  It may be(and probably is, logically speaking) unrelated, but it helps you understand quite how fucking scary the whole thing was.

I don't talk much about the assault, it was extremely traumatic, but basically I was taking the subway, got off the train, and walked through a tunnel towards the southeast exit.  I was completely alone, or at least I thought I was, until a guy suddenly grabbed me, held a knife to my throat (I still have a scar) and hissed ""scream and I will kill you.""  Afterwards, he took all my ID, looked at my driver's licence (which had my full name, date of birth and address on it), said ""nice to meet you, ckincaid"" and just walked away.  I went to the police (I go into the whole ""how I wound up reporting it"" in more detail in another post somewhere) but they never caught him, and he's still out there somewhere with my college ID (so he knows where I go to college and what course I'm doing, and my college is not exactly shy about blabbing personal info to anyone who calls), my driver's licence, and various other things.  Even worse, he had been wearing a mask, so I could see him in the street or outside the college and have no idea it was him.

On to the main story.

One day, walking home from college, I noticed someone walking behind me.  Not too close, maybe 100m or so, but they were taking the same turns as me.  That doesn't necessarily mean much, it's a fairly common route back from town for people living in our estate, but it put me on edge, especially once we got closer to my house and he was speeding up, closing the gap little by little.  I really, REALLY didn't want him to know where I lived, because I would be alone in the house for the next few hours at least, but I also had nowhere else to go.  After the third alleyway in a row, I'd had enough, and looked around for a house with its lights on, bolted to the door, and hammered on it.  No one came to the door, and this guy was getting closer, so I just hammered harder and yelled ""Dave! Mike! Ian!Connor! Jason! Andrew! Owen! Matt! Stop lifting weights for a minute and let me in, there's a creeper following me!""  Seemingly convinced that the house was full of large muscled men about to come to my aid, the guy turned around and got the hell out of Dodge.

It was scary, but I just figured it was one of those things.

After that, the phone calls started.  No one would say anything, they'd just breathe slowly and heavily, and then hang up.  I'm an artist and my phone number is on my business cards and website, so I assumed it's just a prank caller (although my post-traumatic Spidey Sense is kicking in big time.)

After a while, the phone calls stopped, which was a massive relief... at least until two weeks later, when I came home to find the front door unlocked.  I know I locked it, because I live in a dodgy area (so dodgy there are two more locked internal doors between the front door and the stairs to the bedrooms), but nothing had been taken, at least that I could see, so no one really took me seriously.  I called the police, who didn't really give a flying fuck, but after I reminded them repeatedly I'd had an attacker who knew my address and who had made threats against me, they finally agreed to have a police APV drive past every so often and keep an eye out.  That turned out to be bullcrap, but whatever.

A while after that, I came home after making a quick trip to the local shop (all of 300m away if you cut through the alleys, maximum) after putting the second load of laundry on (delicates), got in, and sat on the couch to watch Air Crash Investigation with my cats.  I noticed the cats seemed a little bit skittish, but they are strange creatures and so I ignored it... until I went to go and get the laundry out of the washer, which was in the kitchen on the other side of the hallway.

The kitchen door is always closed because otherwise the cats will eat all the food, so I had to open it to go in, and that's when I saw that the whole floor was flooded.  As in, completely awash with water.  And the washing machine was empty.

I just about shit myself.

I turned around, legged it into the living room, locked all the doors leading into it, and phoned my housemate to ask if she'd been home that day.  She of course said no, and asked what was wrong.  When I told her I thought someone had been in the house, she asked if anything had been stolen, but all the electronics were still there - laptop, TV, Wii, everything.  I start to feel a bit like an idiot, even though there is a part of me going ""WHAT ABOUT THE FUCKING LAUNDRY??"", because who the hell breaks into a house and doesn't take any electronics?  I sigh, start apologising for bothering her, and then glance up at the drying rack and notice ALL my underwear is gone.

That was it for me.  I grabbed the cats and booked it outside to call the poiice again.  Once again, they seemed uninterested.  So I called my friend Sean, who is a badass, and he went through my house and established no one else was there, and told me to call if there was anything else.  Not sure what else to do (he had to go to work, and I was already wondering if I was just being paranoid - after all, how could he have gotten in without breaking a window?), I went back inside, but didn't move off the sofa until my housemate came home.

Later that week, I found a small screwdriver in the bush by the front door.  Upon closer inspection, there were dozens of tiny scratches around the keyhole.

Weeks pass.  Nothing else happens, and I'm feeling like an idiot.  Sure, my underwear and other laundry is still MIA, but what can I say, I'm great at finding explanations for things.  More time passes, and my housemate flies home to England to visit her parents.  I'm a little wary, obviously, but tell myself there's nothing to worry about and get on with things.  This works for a few days, until one night  about 1am I'm sitting in my bedroom doing online jigsaw puzzles, and happen to glance out the window (my bed is right in front of the window.)

There was a man standing right on the other side of the fence between my yard and the empty field behind my house.  Not moving, not showing any sign of doing anything, just standing and looking up at my window.  I told myself he was just a random nosy sod who was out walking his dog or something and had seen me silhouetted in the window with my light on, so I closed the curtains and tried to ignore it.  Twenty minutes or so later, curiosity gets the better of me and I open the curtains again.

He's still there, and hasn't moved an inch.

I flip out, grab my phone and call 999.

""There's a man standing outside watching me""
""Where?""
""The field behind my house, he's just standing behind the fence""
""Is he on your property?""
""...No?""
""Call us when he is""
""But... he's been there nearly half an hour, he's right behind the fence, can't you just-""
""Call us when he's on your property.""

Great.  So glad I have these brave officers on my side.

An hour later he's still there.  He still hasn't moved.  I crack and grab the phone again.

""Hi, I called earlier, there's a man in the field behind the house, and-""
""Is he on your property?""

The whole charade is repeated all over again.  I'd grab my stuff and get out, but I live in a pretty grim estate (like a housing project, for any Americans) and it'd be a pretty crap turn of events if I fled a prowler only to get grabbed by a gang with knives.

Once again, I called Sean.  This time, I told him to bring the gun.

He got there remarkably fast, and I took him out to the back yard.  The guy was still there.  I saw this look cross Sean's face (he is very protective of me) and he said loudly ""It's really lucky I've moved in with you now, isn't it?"" and loudly cocked the gun (it was one of the pump action ones.)  ""Boy, I'd hate to be anyone who tried to break into my house, what with all my guns and all!""  He glanced around, said ""Oh, there's that pesky rat!"" and raised, aimed, and discharged the gun in one fluid motion into the ground maybe six feet in front of him.

I wish I could say the guy ran away, because that'd be less creepy, but what he did was even creepier.  He just turned and slowly walked away into the darkness.

Sean slept on the couch that night.

As of yet, I haven't seen the guy again, and I've since changed my name and cancelled everything with ties to my address.  I've also cut my hair, and completely changed my style of dressing.  I never wear skirts anymore, even though I used to wear them every day, because the man on the subway had specifically said how much he loved women in skirts.

I still don't sleep too great though, to be honest."	t5_2t3t8	True
1368063910.0	1dz28e	Not a Happy Ending	CliffordMoreau	282	41	33	"Ok. This story is a bit odd, and I'm not entirely sure if this is the place for it. Whatever. I am an 18 year old male, but this happened when I was 14. I knew this girl who everyone picked on for wearing all black and stuff and so on and so forth.

We were good friends, and I ended up getting a crush on her. I would find myself talking to her for hours at night. Puppy love, you know the kind. Anyways, one day she walks into my Chem class and is being very quiet. I manage to make her tell me what's eating her; she says this man who she thinks has been stalking her had moved into their neighborhood.

I occasionally saw the man she was talking about doing yard work, but I never actually caught him being stalky (I was on 'recon missions' for this girl). Every week she'd get more and more quiet and every week she'd tell me the same thing, 'He just won't stop staring at me, and trying to talk to me on my way home.'

I ended up calling the police once because she said she could hear someoen trying to break in when she was alone. Cops didn't find anything.

Sometime in November, her parents called me wondering where she was. I was fucking terrified. Eventually, creepy neighbor visited them and said he found her wandering around the school park and brought her home. She wouldn't even look at me any more, and she started ~~going~~ skipping school.

And finally on December 28th, she committed suicide. I was torn apart, and I kept telling her parents it was the new neighbor. That is when I started seeing this guy around. He'd drive behind me slowly after school, he'd always seem to know when I was weed-eating or mowing the yard, because he'd be parked just across the street on this dirt trail.

Unlike my friend, I never saw him again because I moved. I wonder what kind of sick things he had done to her when they were alone. I don't even know if the guy is alive or arrested or continuing his sick reign of fear."	t5_2t3t8	True
1354147888.0	13ypv1	Substitute Teacher		274	32	16	"Well, I was about ten years old and I was a fifth grader. I lived in the nice part of town so the elementary school was pretty nice even if it was just a public school. Nothing really happened that was ever out of the ordinary. 

There were a couple of days every now and then when my teacher would have to get a substitute for a day or two. One man was the most popular among students because he was nice and funny and he'd always let us talk while we worked, rather than write down all of the names of the kids that talked to give to our teacher when she came back.

At first, we all liked him. He'd try his best to help us with our book work despite the fact that he was just a substitute and may not have known ALL of the material. (Insert Are You Smarter Than A Fifth Grader joke here.) Whenever our teacher would have to be out for something, we'd hope and pray that she would have this guy substitute.

Around the second time that he was there, something weird happened. I had a question about something on one of our assignments, so I went up to him and asked for help. As I stood next to him, he turned his whole body so that it was facing the right side of my body and I was pointing at my paper. He placed one hand on my lower back and one hand on my stomach as he leaned over me to look at my sheet.

It made me feel odd, you know? I've read a lot of stories on here about how there's a feeling you get and it says something like, *This is wrong. This is not how this person should be behaving.* That's exactly how it happened to me. I froze up; I couldn't move.

I didn't mention it to any of my other classmates though because I felt like maybe it was normal, even though I've met this guy twice and my normal teacher who I was around for the last five months had never touched me like that.

A month or two later, my teacher told us again that she'd be out for the next class. She told us that he would the one substituting and I mentally groaned because he just freaked me out. I remember that most of the kids in my class had cheered, but about two other girls and I stayed stone-faced.

He came back and he touched me like that again. I paid more attention this time to how he interacted with the other kids. When a boy needed his help, his arms remained at his side. When a girl approached him with a question, his hands would touch their lower backs and sometimes their stomachs.

I had failed to mention it to anybody for the next few weeks. A neighborhood girl and I had the same class, and she had come over to my house to play basketball. Casually, I brought it up and asked if he had touched her too or if she had seen him touch anybody else, and she confirmed that both had happened to her too.

I brought it up to my dad later that night after she had gone home. Looking back, I can tell that he definitely got angry about it, but he tried to remain calm... probably for my benefit so that I wouldn't get even more scared or something. ""I'll take care of it,"" is all I can remember him saying about it.

The next time we had to have a substitute, a hopeful boy asked if the man would be subbing. My teacher said something like, ""No, I'm having somebody else come in."" I never saw him after that.

I just realized that two of my three LetsNotMeet stories have been taken care of by my dad. What a cool guy."	t5_2t3t8	True
1346626151.0	z91il	Wrong Apartment	sashathebrit	287	45	34	"This literally just happened to me.                                                     

I live in a one-bedroom in a fairly nice apartment complex.  It's just me, a 5'2, 120 lb female, and my cat (Miss Mewsy is her name and she's the best cat ever) and I rarely get visitors since all my friends live a 20 minutes bus ride away and I usually go to them.  Today was cleaning day, and I was busying myself around the apartment, vacuuming and dusting and being all womanly.  Even had cookies in the oven.  I had just taken out the trash and gotten back inside to sit down and have a cup of tea when I heard the door open.                                                                  
                                                                                              
My apartment is laid out so that the front door opens onto the kitchen, with the living room just beyond then a hallway going to the bedrooms.  I have no weaponry except my kitchen knives, and I knew that if I made a run for them, I'd probably get stopped by the intruder and it would just be a bad time over all.  So I picked up my cell phone, dialed 911 and had it ready to call.  I called ""Hello?"" from the living room.  A guy walked into my living room, calm as you please, looked around pleasantly, and said ""Oh, wrong apartment.""                         
I would've been OK if this had been the end of it, but the dude SITS DOWN on my futon and starts to make small talk with me.  ""My name's Greg, what's your name?  Have you lived here long?  What an adorable cat.  Is there anything to eat?""                                                    
I stood up very calmly and told him that he needed to get the fuck out of my apartment before I called the police.  He looked sort of hurt, and asked if he could at least use the bathroom first.  I knew something was up, since supposedly his apartment was in the same building, so I told him ""All right.""  I followed him to the bathroom to make sure that was where he was going, then dashed to the kitchen and got my butcher's cleaver.  He came out a few seconds later and was sketchily trying to make it to my bedroom when he saw me, my eyes as wide as they can go, wielding this big fucking knife.                                     
""YOU TRYING TO ROB ME, MOTHERFUCKER?!"" I yelled.  My walls are thin and there is a young family right next door and a proud NRA member downstairs (he showed me his card and everything.  Nice old chap).  He heard a door slam shut from downstairs and footsteps coming up and he immediately high-tailed it out of there, went out the back door of the building and sprinted across the green.  Downstairs Man calmed me down and I called the police and described the intruder to them.  Hopefully he gets caught."	t5_2t3t8	True
1345666503.0	ynmdq	One of the only people we ever kicked out of that house . . . 	Beginning_End	287	46	35	"Quite a few years ago we lived in a large 7 bedroom house. It was in the SDSU college area and was what people often call ""mini-dorms"" . . .I.E. a house that has been converted into essentially a student house.

That said, none of us were students, simply a bunch of 20 somethings that knew each other and needed a place to live while figuring we could save money by living together.

As you could imagine, a 7 bedroom house filled with people aged 19-25 ended up being a party house. To really top it off, one of the roommates was a drug dealer (ecstasy and acid mostly) so at any given moment there could be a party happening. We were all pretty libertine with our views and most of the people were pretty odd sorts, as well, so all kinds of bizarre, nutty, odd and quirky people were floating around that house. I mention this just to set the stage that we were pretty accepting people. Quite often we had people acting like fools, having a bad trip, being crazy sluts or just plain doing weird shit. You learn to deal with it.

One night we're having a legitimate party. Anywhere from 35-50 people in the house, tons of drugs and booze and hook-ups and stupidity are happening and people are generally having a good time. . . that is until one of the girls of the house approaches me about a guy nick-named Casper (I don't remember his real name any more) who's really creeping people out. I'm kind of hearing her out when another female friend of mine either overhears or simply approaches and confirms, ""Yeah, he's acting real fucking weird and creepy, he really needs to go, he's pretty much creeping out every girl here.""

Now keep in mind, we'd never actually kicked anyone out of the house. While it *was* a party house, most everyone that would show up to our get-togethers were either friends or friends of friends. . . but I personally didn't really know this guy . . . so I go up to the person who knows him the best and lives there and ask her what the deal is and she confirms as well that he's acting weird.

Strike three, there. With the friend that knows him, another large friend of mine, I approach Casper and we tell him that he simply needs to go home, he's not welcome here right now. Strangely enough he doesn't really fuss about it much and takes off. I probably wouldn't have even remembered the incident by this point were it not for the fact that two days later they found his girlfriend's hacked up corpse in a dumpster.

**EDIT: I asked a friend for his real name and luckily she remembered. I guess I had part of the story wrong and it's almost even more creepy. Apparently she wasn't even his girlfriend, just an acquaintance that shot down his advances. Considering his behavior at the party, I find our instincts in this situation even more fortuitous.**

**Update**

So I got more info from one of the other girls that was there. I feel a lot worse about my understanding of the situation but I'm going to post this even though it makes me look shitty, in my opinion, but in my own defense, I was that ""someone"".

(text conversation):

Everyone has a story of someone in their past whom they expect to see on the nightly news. That steroid fused father who got thrown out of his kid’s soccer game. The moronic prankster who sent out an anonymous bomb threat just to cut class. That ex who could never quite give up. For me, it’s exponential. Every time I hear a tragedy on the news, whether it be a shooting or a kidnapping or some other horror, a small voice in the back of my head creeps up, from a whisper to a crescendo… What if? What if that guy finally did what he said he would? And I never told anyone. I can’t live with that. So now, I’m telling you. 

There aren’t any ghouls, ghosts, or goblins in this story. No creatures hiding in your peripherals, or delusions of grandeur. This is the story of the truest horror I've experienced my entire life, one that I’ve kept to myself for far too long. This is the story of the psychopath who ruined my Sophomore year of college.
 
I went to a state school in the heart of New Jersey. My life wasn't all that different from your average college experience, I suppose. After a year of living in on campus, my friends and I decided to finally break the shackles of dorm life and rent a house off campus. 

The area, and the house itself, were sketchy at best. In the first month, we were forced to move out for a couple of days because of an electrical fire in the upstairs apartment. It was fairly common for someone to be mugged late at night, and if you went down a few blocks, shootings were not unheard of either.
 
I rented the house with five other guys, and a group of six girls lived next door. We had known them from Freshman year, and managed to rent two buildings right next door to one another. The first couple weeks were amazing... parties, drinking, debauchery. Sleep was for the day, and class was for the dumb. 
 
One girl in particular, Alyssa, had always been like a little sister to me. She had dated my friend for a few months, and we had become good friends in the process. Alyssa was the type of girl that had to try every obscure activity once. What better way to enjoy the “college experience”, than to try everything? Starcraft club? Check. Classics club dress up night? Check. Getting stoned and passing out on the roof? Check. It was her idea to move somewhere nearby, and I was naturally all for it.
 
One day, after a few weeks of living off campus, she came to me with a flier for an on campus event. *Learn to Give the Perfect Massage*, I believe it was called. To be honest, I wasn’t one to sacrifice my time for these events. They usually involved forced social interactions, that almost always led to nothing but twenty kids desperately eyeing the clock. However, I hadn't been out all that much, and I had been pigeonholing myself to my own group of friends for quite sometime. It was time to meet some new people, so I decided to give it a shot.

Alyssa and I got to the class fives minutes late, and the lecture had begun as we grabbed our seats. Most people in the class were typical guys, anxious for the excuse to obviously grope girls. A few were shy, awkward Freshmen who were just trying to meet new friends. One guy, however, stood out to me. He stood at the back of the room, away from all the mini groups and circles that had formed. He sat on the floor with his legs spread and pulled up to his chest, and he looked straight at the floor with a surly look painted on his stoic face.
 
For a reason that I can’t really explain, this guy struck me as… different. I don’t know why, to be honest. He wasn't any taller than average. No shorter, no thinner, no fatter. His hair wasn't too long, or too short. He wore a pair of blue jeans and a plain white shirt. But the way he avoided eye contact with anyone in the room, for the entirety of the lecture, still gives me chills to this day.
 
After a brief introduction and an hour or so of instruction and lecture, we were randomly paired to begin trying the exercises on one another. I was paired with a chatty girl with long black hair who seemed nice enough. Alyssa, on the other hand, was not so lucky.
 
Now, this part of the story I only know secondhand. I was on the other side of the room and, to be honest, far more interested in my partner than what was going on with Alyssa. When it was time to go, I walked over to Alyssa and her partner and said hello. She smiled nervously at me, pretending to be incredibly involved with putting things in her backpack, while her partner glared at me for about ten seconds. I opened my mouth to introduce myself, and he turned and walked away.

“What was that about?” I had asked her, thoroughly baffled.

“I have no idea,” she responded. “He didn’t say a word the entire time. I tried to talk to him, ask him about school… not a word. He just said his name was TJ. Can we just go?”

Thinking little of it, we grabbed and bags and headed home. Because it was a Friday night, Alyssa and her room mates came over to drink and hang out. To be candid, I don’t remember much of that night. So let’s move on to the next morning.

Alyssa woke up and had five emails. All from different addresses, but with a similar theme. She sent me them at one point, but I lost them, so I’ll have to paraphrase:

----

**Email 1**
Hello, this is TJ from class. It was really nice to meet you.

**Email 2**
Do you know of any parties tonight? I’d love to bring you to one, my number is (redacted).

**Email 3**
 Do you use this email often?

**Email 4**
Please write back with your number.

**Email 5**
I added you on Facebook. My name there is Joe Simpson.

---

First off, Alyssa never gave him her email. He probably found it on a school mailing list, or something along those lines. Regardless, Alyssa responded with a kind yet firm email. She lied and said her boyfriend (one of my room mates) was very protective, and didn’t want her giving her number out to guys. After that, he didn’t respond through email.

Second, his name wasn’t Joe Simpson. 

I have no idea why he liked alternate names, but it wasn’t the first he tried to add her with. Henry Ford. John Jones. There were at least twenty in the first week.

Then it started to get creepier. He would create names that meant something to her. Jim Carry, her favorite actor, was one. When that didn’t work, he tried her favorite author, musician, athlete. We never knew how he learned so much about her.

The messages started to get more… descriptive, as well. He would say things like “Your boyfriend is a fucking scumbag. He’s cheating on you,” and “If I can make him leave you, will you see me?” Ignoring him only made it worse. The messages turned into phone calls after he, somehow, got her phone number.

He would call in the middle of the night. 1 AM, 2, 3. It didn’t matter. Sometimes he wouldn’t say a thing at all; he’d just sit in silence as Alyssa yelled into the phone, begging for him to leave her alone.

Once he got Alyssa’s phone number, he got her boyfriend’s. He would call and send text messages, telling him he was worthless. That she didn’t care about him. That he had hooked up with her. 

When it got to the point that they were concerned for their safety, they contacted the school. Keep in mind, this was before the school shoots in the United States were a major problem. Back then, schools were not nearly as concerned about what they viewed as ‘an argument’ among college students. Since he had never physically threatened either Alyssa or her boyfriend, there was nothing they could do but bring him in for a talk.

That didn’t help.

Three days later, Alyssa got a text message from TJ. It was just a couple words, but it was enough.

It was her address.

Funny how two words on 4x4 screen can make you fear for your safety, and the safety of those around you. She didn’t respond. She packed up a bunch of her stuff, called her boyfriend, and asked if she could stay at our place for a little bit. She didn’t have any other guy friends in the area, and she didn’t have the money for a hotel. Naturally, we told her of course. What did one guy have against six overconfident 19 year olds?

I was out late that night. My room mates stayed at home, while I went out to a nearby bar and had a drink (or six) with some friends from class. I remember stumbling back down the empty college streets around two in the morning. It had just started to snow, and I was underdressed. A thin button down clung to my skin. I stripped it off as I rounded the corner to my house. 

I was drunkenly trying to shake the snow off of it when I looked up, and saw TJ standing on my front porch. He turned to face me, and I’ll never forget the look of determination painted on his face.

In one hand, he held a collapsible baton. In the other, the key to our apartment.

1362689875.0	19v8ra	Best friend's ex stepfather	Anxious_midwesterner	273	34	22	"When I was in seventh and eighth grade, I was best friends with a girl named Sunny. We were also close with a girl named Liz. The three of us were inseperable and spent most of our free time together. We lived within walking distance of each other and most often we'd all be found at Sunny's place. Her mom worked a lot and she had a step dad who would take us to Burger King, the mall, a local amusement park. Her stepdad's name was Rich. At the time I couldn't have explained it to you, but I never really felt safe around Rich. Something about him just did not seem... correct. He used to call Sunny in from school a lot so she could hang out at home. One time I called myself in from school to hang out with her. He knew about it, and didn't seem to care. He'd occasionally tell jokes that were not appropriate for 13-14 year old girls. He'd buy us cigarettes, too.

The summer before 9th grade, Sunny's mom and stepdad got divorced. In spite of this, he was still around a lot, especially when Sunny's mom was at work. He was always making an effort to hang around us girls, but stopped making any effort to be a father figure to Sunny's older brother.
Rich had moved in with his parents, and Liz, Sunny and I were invited to slumber parties at his parents' home. The parents travelled a lot, and were never there. Us three girls would all sleep on the floor in this big upstairs playroom. Presumably, Rich slept in his old bedroom. But one morning, very early in the morning, I woke up on that floor and felt as though someone was watching me. I lay very still for a moment, looked around, and saw Rich over by the wall, watching us.  Instinct told me to let him know I knew he was there. I said, 'Good morning.' And he slunk out of the room without a word. 

About a week later, the three of us stayed there overnight again. I don't recall any incident that night, but in the morning, Rich was gone to work. And Sunny was *furious* at him, although she did not say why. She said she never wanted to see him again, and asked us to help her pack up her things. We went through the house and gathered up her stuff. I remember grabbing her keys off of a dresser and slipping them in my pocket so we wouldn't forget them. We then walked the two miles to her mom's place. Halfway there, Sunny panicked, thinking she'd forgotten her keys. She was very upset and screamed at me when I gave them to her. I mention this because I think it illustrates how upset she was, especially at the thought of having to go back to that house. Sunny was kind of the 'pack leader' for our group of girls, and though Liz and I wondered what was up, we didn't push for details.

Sunny was true to her word and refused to see Rich again. He would call a lot, and I remember a few different times he would knock on her door when we were there alone. She'd never answer, and the older brother told him to fuck off a few times, and finally he stopped coming around. I think it helped that Sunny's mom got a new boyfriend and he moved in.

I found out months later that Rich had been molesting Sunny. He told her that he wanted to marry her now that he'd divorced her mom. She didn't tell her mom, not even after the fact, for a couple years. Eventually she did, and the mom went to the police. Sunny had to give a statement, I know that much. And I remember her telling me that he admitted to abusing her. I don't know what kind of sentence he got. Sunny went through some rough years, but she's got a good life now.

My parents never knew about any of this. It's amazing the things that happen, the kind of people you can be around, and your parents know nothing about them. So I guess my advice to parents would be to make an effort to meet the parents of your kid's friends. I'm lucky I just got creeped out instead of abused in some way. Also, let your kids know that adults that let you break rules (smoking cigarettes, skipping school) are not actually cool. They're doing it because they want something from you.

I remember when I was about 9 I thought my mum was a crazy person because I heard her walking around the kitchen at night saying ""you don't belong here, move on!"" and similar things. Over the years I heard little snippets of her talking about this to friends but she always shut up when she was aware I was listening. I honestly thought she thought we had a ghost, I heard her talking about footsteps and things being moved. It wasn't until 20 years later that she told me what actually happened. Not only were there footsteps and things being moved, but food was going missing too. One night, I was sent to my room abruptly (I should remember this, being that I was 9, but I don't). Apparently I thought I was in huge trouble but it was because mum didn't want me to see what was actually happening. The cops came to our house, went into our roof and PULLED DOWN A GUY THEY HAD HANDCUFFED!!! He had escaped from some prison and had spent a few weeks in our roof.

1376251676.0	1k5tbw	Rest stops are gross	RestStopTA	283	46	30	"Okay, this is one of my favorite subs and I've been thinking about posting this story for awhile. It's Sunday and I'm bored so I decided to finally put this on here for you guys to read. 
Back in 2005 when I was 18 I had just dropped out of highschool in mn. It was about halfway through the school year and I just didn't have the credits I needed to graduate. I had some health problems my junior year and was altogether frustrated with my life at this point in time. I was more concerned with drinking than I was school. So I dropped out and bought a plane ticket and went to live for awhile with my cousin and his girlfriend in Washington state. They lived in a town about an hour north of Seattle. I also had some friends that were a year older than me living down in Seattle. I would occasionally drive down to the city to spend a few days with them. Go to concerts and things like that. 

After a particular stint in Seattle I decided to head back north to my cousins place. Me being the financially impaired individual that I was at the time, I left Seattle without a dollar to my name. As I'm getting on the road I notice I am very low on gas. I figure I can make it though. But of course about twenty miles short of my exit the car that I am driving begins to putter and gasp for more fuel. Lucky for me (actually unlucky) I am coming up on a rest area. 
So I pull in and go to the pay phone to begin to call the very few contacts that I know in this state. I had no money so I had to call collect. So I get ahold of my cousin and he happens to be about three hours away in his hometown and drunk no less. No luck there so I call his girlfriend and she never answers. Everyone I know in Seattle doesn't own a car, so I'm kind of hosed. My cousin said he was coming home in the morning and could pick me up on his way through. So it looks like I'm spending the night at this rest stop. 

So I get settled with my seat reclined and using a hoodie as a blanket. I'm there for about twenty minutes when a van pulls into the rest area. It was a one of those chevy astro vans. The van parks and out gets your typical creeper. About five foot five. Pudgy. Balding. Thick glasses. Creeper begins walking around the parking area glancing into all of the parked cars. There were about three other cars at the time. He walks slowly right in front of my car and just stares me down for what seems like an hour. 

At this point I'm pretty sure my future involves me being referenced in a documentary about serial killers. 
So creeper guy gets back in his van and parks it so he is behind me on the other side of the parking lot. ( I am parked facing the bathroom area and he is parked behind me facing the wooded area) 

At this point I am no longer reclined and relaxed. I am now sitting quite awake and am not taking my eyes off this shit head. I can look in my side view mirror and see him in his side view mirror just staring at my car. This goes on for about two hours and he would occasionally get out of his van and go stand in the woods in the darkness. I could tell he was still watching me because I could see the cherry on his cigarette light up as he would inhale. 
At this point I'm pretty on edge and have to piss like crazy. There is no way in hell I am going to walk into that bathroom with this guy around. I decide to call state patrol and have them kick this guy out of here. So I ring the state patrol and tell them the situation. They say they will send a trooper through. 

So I hang up the phone and am kind of pacing around all while keeping my eye on this creep-o. After about thirty seconds the pay phone rings. I'm thinking its state patrol calling back for some reason. I answer

Me: ""hello?"" 

Caller: ""you want your dick sucked"" 

Me: -shocked silence- 

Caller: "" let me suck your dick"" 

Me: ""what the fuck? Fuck no"" 

I slam the receiver down. The damned creeper has the pay phone number and is calling me from the woods. I am slightly terrified at this point and am kinda frozen but ready to run a million miles an hour if necessary. I've got my eye on the woods. The phone rings again. Can't decide to answer or not. I don't want to miss state patrol if they are calling for some reason. So I answer silently 

Me:........

Creeper: ""come on, let me suck your dick. I don't wanna have to hurt you. I could even give you some money"" 

At this point this piece of turd has threatened me so I immediately go into rage mode. I start quickly for my car when I remember there is an axe handle in the back end for situations like this I suppose. As I'm walking towards the car the creeper starts out of the woods and is walking towards me! 

I get to my car, grab the axe handle and start towards this guy pointing it at him. 

"" motherfucker get back in your van and get the fuck out of here or I am going to bash your skull in."" 

He stops in his tracks. Stares at me kind of accessing me. He turns around gets in his van and slowly drives away staring at me. 

I am completely shaking due to the adrenaline when the trooper finally arrives. So I tell him the whole story and he takes my information and says he can drive me up the highway to the Denny's so I can stay the rest of the night safe there. He asks if we can first go to the other side of the highway to see if the guy has just switched rest areas. I agree. 
We pull in to the rest area and lo and behold there's the van. The trooper approaches the van and is talking to the guy for about five minutes and I can tell the trooper is giving him the third degree. Sticking his finger in his face and raising his voice. The trooper returns and tells me the situation. 

Apparently there was nothing he could do to charge the guy at this point in time (seemed odd to me, the guy had threatened me and was soliciting sex at a rest stop). The guy didn't have a license. He claimed a friend had dropped him off and he was waiting for him to return. The trooper told him if he was still there when he passed back through he would be arrested for trespassing and if he or any other troopers saw him driving he would be arrested for not having a license. The trooper also told me he had several pairs of binoculars and a large bag of candy in his front seat. (Shudder). 

So I get dropped at Denny's and my cousin eventually picks me up and I tell him the story. We have a good laugh being able to look back on it. We go back the next day with a can of gas to get my car. End of story, right? Nope 

We arrive at my car and there is a note under my wiper. From the damn creeper. It was written in the form of poem.  I can't remember it exactly but it went something like this 

You shoulda shut your mouth you stupid little bitch 

Somebody shoulda taught you to never go and snitch 

You should go and get back on mommas tit..... 


It went on for several pages but can't remember more. The guy had cut all the brake lines and everything he could underneath the car. We called the troopers again. They came and took the note and took some more information. 

It wasn't even my car. A friend of mine had been visiting from mn and wanted to buy a car and road trip back to mn. He decided against it and left the car and said I could use it and he would make plans to get it later. 

I didn't stay in Washington much longer after that. I spoke to an investigator one more time but nothing ever came of it and I don't know why. They knew who the guy was and everything. I was over it and just wanted to move on. 

For the short time I was in Washington after this me and my cousin would pull into every rest stop we passed hoping to find this guy. In retrospect its a good thing we never saw him again because we were dead set on seriously hurting him. 

TL/DR: got stalked and propositioned by a typical perv at a rest stop. 

Sorry if too long or poorly written. I don't do much writing. I haven't told this story in years but this seemed like the perfect place to tell it."	t5_2t3t8	True
1366472738.0	1cqu93	Heard someone outside of my window	BuuTH3aD	265	28	33	"During the summer when I was a kid, I used to stay with my grandma for several days at a time. One week when I was 12, it was just my grandma and I in her house for 5 days. She owns a small handgun and the whole family knows she wouldn't be afraid to use it when push comes to shove.

One night, we both went to bed earlier than usual at about 11 P.M. I woke up very early. Since there was no clock in the room, I pulled up the blinds and looked out the window, which was right next to me, to see what time of day it was. It was very dark (it was a rural town so there were no cars, neighbors, or streetlights), so I guessed that it was somewhere between 2 A.M. and 4 A.M. A few seconds after I closed the blinds, I heard a deep male voice whisper ""Pssst. Hey, you."" I knew that the voice came from outside the window. The room I slept in was on the opposite end of the house as my grandma's room, but since her house is pretty small, she could have heard me and woken up if I yelled. However, I was paralyzed with fear. I was eventually able to convince myself that it did not happen by telling myself ""oh, you were half asleep, it was probably your imagination"" and sat still in my bed for an hour staring at the door. 

I was eventually able to fall asleep, and had a nightmare of a man running into my room. I immediately woke up. It was then dawn, and I had gathered up enough courage to run to my grandma's room. We looked around the house for a short amount of time and we judged that the man was long gone. I went back to bed and woke up a few hours later. My mom was talking to my grandma in the living room ready to take me home because it was my last day. When I walked in the room, my grandma told me what she saw on the news before I woke up again. A convict was being transported to a new prison and had escaped from the transport less than a mile from the house. I never looked into it because I had no intentions of finding out what he was convicted of.

1340574806.0	vjh7z	Why You Don't Give Out Your Details Online	Crunch_Munch	276	36	56	"Just gonna preface this by saying this is my first ever Reddit post so I hope I don't break any unspoken rules, or utterly screw up my formatting. I've read every post on this Subreddit and I love it, so I thought I'd contribute with a story about things that've happened to me.

So, when I was younger, I was an absolute idiot when it comes to using the internet. I'd constantly go into chat rooms assuming everyone was my own age and harmless, and basically answer anything people asked me. For the most part, I got through this period of my life without running into any trouble. Eventually I did something really stupid though.

Like most teenage boys, I spent a lot of my time online searching for porn, and I guess I was pretty bad at it because the best source I had was downloading things over Kazaa(lol). At some point, someone messaged me. I didn't even know you COULD message people over Kazaa, so I was surprised and a bit freaked out. From what I can remember, they just wanted to know more about me and what kind of porn I liked. I should probably mention I'm gay, and I'd never spoken about it with anyone in my life (I was only like 13 at this point), so I actually replied and started a conversation with this person, who told me his name was Glen.

Eventually Glen convinced me to add him to MSN Messenger, and we spoke over there instead since it was easier. For the most part, we actually had normal conversations, but he was always kind of off. I can't remember any details since this was over a decade ago, but I remember that he was interested in furry porn (don't ask if you don't know what that is) and kept trying to get me into it, but it weirded me out.

At some point, presumably because I had no one else to talk to and felt like I could trust this guy, I gave him pretty much all of my details. Real name, phone number, address. Holy shit was that ever stupid of me. He lived in a different country than me, so we didn't talk over the phone often, and at first he would always tell me on MSN before he phoned so that my parents wouldn't answer first. 

Eventually, he started calling on his own, at awkward times of the day, very late at night. He wouldn't let me hang up, guilting me into talking to him longer, until I started getting really freaked out and realized I fucked up by giving some random person my phone number. I think I made up some kind of lie about being grounded from the phone, so he stopped calling for a while and we only spoke online.

At this point, I decided I was sufficiently creeped out and actively avoided talking to him, blocking him on MSN and only talking to him like once a week or less, knowing he'd phone me if I didn't. Eventually, he disappeared online and I was realized, thinking it was over.

Then the letters started.

He had never once asked if it was ok to send me anything, which it frankly wasn't. The letters he sent were obscene, saying how much he wanted us to meet up and do things, and had pictures of the most fucked up porn you can imagine folded into them. Keep in mind I was not even close to being 16, much less an adult, at this point so this was really not appropriate. My parents were curious about the letters, but I made up some kind of lie about having made a pen pal, and they believed it and never opened any of the letters. That is probably the biggest bullet I dodged, though it was honestly probably a mistake not telling them.

I never once replied to any of the letters, and actually asked him online not to send me things in the mail. I didn't want to make him angry, because this guy knew everything about me. I told him I was moving out to live with my dad and wouldn't give him my new phone number (I was currently living with my mom and step-dad), so he got angry and blocked me on MSN. I was worried that he would call the house and try to talk to my parents, tell them lies or personal things I had divulged. 

He never called again, but before he disappeared, he sent a package in the mail. It was a... large flat envelope, heavily stuffed and coloured really strangely. It was pink, purple and red and my parents were super confused when it arrived. I was afraid to open it, really not knowing what to expect. I don't even know how to properly describe what was inside. There was the usual variety of creepy furry porn, a small, folded flag of his country, and uh, apparently stuff he had drawn. Most of it was not obscene, but I seem to recall some of it being laughably bad drawn porn. Opening this package and inspecting the insides was the biggest WTF moment of my life.

He never sent anything again, never called again and we didn't speak on MSN anymore. He tried at least three times to talk to me through email, but I didn't respond. I threw out all his letters for fear of my parents finding them.

Sorry, this turned out way longer than I was expecting; I think I'm overly verbose today. I feel like this could have turned out way worse if this guy had actually lived in the same country as me, but I've been super careful ever since then. It was a huge relief when my mom finally moved out of the house, since I knew it was finally over.

**tl;dnr: stupid kid gives address online, crazy guy mails porn**

**edit:** removed a few lines about possibly keeping stuff, since i didn't. Also, totally just remembered something I can't believe I forgot... the reason the last envelope was so huge was that he had sent a CD with it. On the CD was more porn, including a strip tease he had done of himself. I actually skipped through it out of horrified curiosity, and it was like watching that scene in Silence of the Lambs when buffalo bill is wearing his skin suit in front of the mirror. I'm pretty sure I immediately destroyed the cd after."	t5_2t3t8	True
1339563315.0	uzbmv	Attack of the Creepy Hipster	myusernameisrelevant	298	58	56	"I work nights, so I usually stop at Mcdonald's and grab a coffee or at BP and get some Monsters. I live in a teeny tiny town right off a major high way, so I'm used to creepers piling in occasionally. I decided that I wanted some faygo (don't you judge me) so I pulled into the BP to hunt down some. As I'm glancing through the fridges I notice there this guy beside me. Someone obviously off the highway and from way the hell away from here. As a farming community, we don't have hipsters. This guy was a full-blown hipster. V-Neck down to his sternum, shorts made out of some material you've probably never heard of, and flip flops. Topped off with a mass of curly brown hair, a shitty gotee, and a fedora. He was also really tall and lanky, probably a good six five and 140lbs soaking wet. Because he dressed so weird compared to what I'm used to, I glanced over at him.

Apparently that was mistake number one. He turned his full attention to me with this massive grin. He had a HUGE mouth with perfectly set white teeth. ""Hey pretty girl, what's up?"" I didn't say anything at first because I started to panic. 

""Uh... Not... Much..."" I just kinda stammered out, grabbing a Monster and spinning around back towards the front of the store. He followed me, chit chatting about random shit. His name, his home town (Millville is what he said), blah blah bullshit. I just kind of ""mmhmm'd"" at him as I finally broke into the safety of the young cashier's vision. She was probably only a little under my age so I hoped she would understand how creepy this guy was being.

Apparently not, because she started flirting with him. This was good because it got him off my scent. I quickly paid for my shit and hightailed it out of there. I slid into my car and dropped my shit in the seat in less than ten seconds, it had to be... When I turned around to shut the door now that I had an open hand, he was there.

""Where are you going? I want your number."" 

OH GOD. I just sat there for a second, dazed. ""No, I'm not giving you my number. Go away."" I pulled on the door a bit, nudging him. He KICKED it back, fully open to where I couldn't reach around him. I grabbed my wallet (where I keep my cellphone) and threatened to call the cops if he didn't go away. He got this weird look on his face, like extremely pissed mixed with rejection. 

""Oh come on, I just want to go out with you. I want some fun before I head back home. You look like you could be TONS of FUN."" He licked his lips. I was horrified! This guy was the creepiest fuck I've ever been around. He leaned down and one of his long arms came into my car and grabbed my face. Before I knew it he was caressing me and leaning in for a kiss. I panicked and managed to swing my body around and kick him, full force, in the knee. He fell backwards on his ass onto the pavement and I quickly got my phone out and dialed the cops and my work to tell them what had happened and that I would be a bit late.

The cops came and arrested him. The chick in the BP had the nerve to tell them that **I** attacked **HIM**. But they were able to go back through the surveillance and you can clearly see me trying to shut my door and looking pretty damn horrified. I guess he never had any felonies or anything, so they gave him a warning and told him to stay at the hotel, go to his reunion (or whatever), and then go home and that the police would check on him occasionally. I just kind of hopes it was a family reunion because maybe his mom could have beat some sense into him.

Three weeks later I get a friend request on Facebook from his assfaggot. ""Hey girlie, I just wanted to say I was sorry for what happened. I really hope you can forgive me and that we can be friends. Add me back please! xoxox ;)""

I practically cried-laughed for a good ten minutes, deleted the request and blocked him. A day later I get three messages from apparently friends of his. Most of them were: ""You bitch you didn't have the block him there's no fucking reason."" or ""You shouldn't have fucking lead him on you dumb whore"" or my favorite ""I hope you die, cum dumpster."" All from women. I blocked them too. A week later (today) I get a message from ANOTHER account by this guy, ""You're a fucking bitch and I hope you die. You're a stupid whore and had no reason to do this shit to me. You ruined my life. Fuck you and fuck your family."" Needless to say I blocked him too.

What I want to know is how he got my name. The only thing I can think of is that, while I was paying, he managed to see my student ID or the name on my card and get it off that. But another weird thing is that my picture isn't me and I didn't put my real town down... So I wonder if he messaged a bunch of other people and hoped one was me.

Either way, it's still creepy (and slightly hilarious)."	t5_2t3t8	True
1373020160.0	1honnu	Why would you follow a creeper	1piperpiping	278	46	24	"This happened several summers ago when I was working at a summer day camp and living with my grandfather during the week (he was much closer to the camp then my parents).  Where he lived was a somewhat small neighborhood, and somewhat rural.  I'd describe it as also being middle to upper-middle class, and that most people there know each other by sight at least.  I have a beard, and I've been told I look intimidating sometimes.  The car I had at the time was oldish and maybe stood out a bit by being oldish in this neighborhood.

It was a day just like any other.  I drove back to my Grandpa's from work, I was gross and sweaty and wanted to take a shower and eat dinner.  I was wearing my camp shirt and a bandanna.  The route back was some counties roads and a highway.  Most of the way it was one lane but there were multiple lights where it'd be two lanes approaching the light and a little ways after and then back to one lane.  It was about a half hour (20ish mile) drive.

I get back to my Grandpa's development and I notice a car has pulled off behind me.  That's a little weird, but whatever.  It turns down his street behind me and is going really slowly.  This is weird because it's not the car of any of his neighbors that I recognize, and I get this weird feeling.  I can't see whose driving but it's a big SUV (my crappy old car was a sedan) and they're kissing my bumper.  I figure maybe I cut this person off and they're pissed.  I decide not to go right back to Grandpa's because I don't want some crazy person at his house.

So, not knowing where the police station is and not really feeling threatened, I  do a few laps around the neighborhood (driving in circles), to make it very obvious I know this person is following me.  Finally on a turn I'm able to see who it is following me.  It's some 40ish looking lady who doesn't appear to be very large.  I figure, WTF and I pull over into a cul de sac a block or two from my Grandpa's.  This lady starts pulling up, and I start to roll down the window to see wth she wants.

She starts yelling at me that she's calling the cops.  What?  Why?  Apparently, for most of the way back from camp I was behind her (these are pretty busy roads), and so I must have been following her.  I must be in a gang because I'm wearing a bandanna (funny thing is it was brownish/tannish, not red, blue or yellow). I passed her coming out of the last light before my Grandpa's house.  Now she's calling the cops with my plate number etc. and they're apparently going to take me to jail because I'm a scumbag.

I start laughing.  Probably not the correct response, but after a long day in the sun putting up with 12 year olds my brain was fried.  If I was following her, then why the hell would I pass her.  Then she demands to know where I'm going (all of this in between her talking to the cops on the phone).  I tell her hell no, that it's none of her business where I'm going. She starts freaking out, so I get back in the car, and she starts pounding on the windows.

For camp, we had to program the police non-emergency number into our phones, just in case (I don't know in case of what, but I was a good staff member and did). So I call the police, and I tell them what's going on.  Apparently the guy on the other end was sitting adjacent to whoever was talking to Crazy Lady, and said they'd sent a cruiser out already to see what was up (not much to do in this town) and it''d be there in a few minutes.  I explain to the guy what's going on and we have a good chuckle about it.  He says he'll tell the police who're on their way.

Police car shows up a few minutes later, and having already been informed of what was going on, they tell this lady to get away from me and let me go on my merry way.  She's freaking out that they're ""Letting me get away"" and that at this point they're physically restraining her.  I drive off, and don't think much of it.  I eat dinner, shower, etc.

If only this were the end.  A few days later I notice a familiar looking SUV out front of my Grandpa's before I leave for work.  As I come out the door it pulls away really quick, but it was obviously this lady.  Smart me, I took a picture before she pulled away, holding the day's paper in it to show that it was definitely taken after the initial incident.  I called the police, told them and they said they'd check up on it.

I got a call that afternoon saying that they'd had a talking-to with this lady and she thought she had a right to know where I lived. I was a bit worried about anyone hanging around my Grandpa's as he's old and would be easy to take advantage of or rob and just didn't want some crazy bitch hanging around.  The cops told me that they told her that if I ever saw her near there again that I'd have a case to get a restraining order and that they'd help me do that, and charge her with stalking and intimidation or something.  They actually sent a police car by a few times after this, but I never saw her again.

I still wonder why the fuck you would turn off once it became apparent that someone wasn't actually following you and follow them, that makes no sense."	t5_2t3t8	True
1362012801.0	19d53f	He was a nice guy	Dear0phelia	267	31	31	"I grew up in a town with just under nine hundred people. When I was 14 my entire class was forty two students.  It’s a farming community in Oregon, basically in the middle of nowhere, surrounded other small farming towns.   My best friend Sara and I went to the varsity baseball games; we had nothing better to do.  It was fun and Sara’s older brother Aaron was a pitcher.   Aaron’s best friend Sam was one year out of high school and assistant coach to the baseball team. 
 
Sara and Aaron’s parents often left us at their house alone with alcohol and no rules.  My parents didn't care what I was doing, and even though Sam still lived with his parents at 19 Sara and I had never met them.  I supposed they didn't care either.  The four of us hung out at the house at the same time.  Because we were only 14, Aaron and Sam kept a brotherly eye on us.  None of their senior friends would touch us, even if we threw ourselves at them in a drunken haze.  Basically it was Aaron and Sam’s fault we didn't have boyfriends freshman year.

It was one of the last games of the season, Aaron was pitching, and Sam was coaching.  After losing the game the team plus Sara and I went to throw a party as usual.  The parties always happened, win, lose or rain. We drank and hung out, listened to music and played drinking games.  We were all completely average teenagers, with average small town lives.  
After I had consumed far more vodka than orange juice I spilled a drink on the kitchen floor.  Sam helped me clean it up and we stood around talking a little bit before he insisted I go lay down before I fell on my face.  He helped me to Sara’s room gave me a little hug and put me on the bed.  Before he drove home he checked on me, gave me a little wave and said goodnight.  I passed out in fuzzy bliss.

No matter how many times I go over the next day in my head it never seems right.  It was surreal, something I have never understood.  The next thing I remember was screaming, Sara and I woke up to her mother freaking out.  In the living room both Sara’s parents, Aaron and the Douglas County Sheriff stood.  Everyone was way too upset for it to have something we did.  I felt sick and terrified, I couldn't comprehend what was happening.  The Sheriff asked me when the last time I saw Sam was.   I couldn't speak, couldn't figure out what any of them were saying any more.   I managed to say “I was drunk” the Sheriff asked Sara she said the same.  He simply wrote it down and turned away from us.  Very strange.

They had to find Sam, Sam was missing, Sam was running away.  Finally I started putting thoughts together.   Sam was running from the police, because he had killed his parents.  He killed them when he got home from the party, with an axe from the woodshed.  

He had attended the game and the party then went home.   Picked up an axe and struck his father in the head while he was watching TV.  His mother made it to the phone and dialed 911.  Sam killed her with blows from the axe while she spoke to the 911 operator.   Then he disappeared, for two days.  

Honestly, from the moment I learned what had happened, until Sam turned himself in, I was in a daze.  I kept expecting it to be a dream, or a sick joke.  The whole two days I can’t remember what I did, who I talked to.  It didn't help that Sara and I increased our alcohol and drug intake.  
He was such a normal guy, none of us saw what he was capable of.  We were all just typical kids.  This was twenty years ago, people still avoid talking about it.  I never tell the story either.

1361820059.0	197h8r	Handprints. 	alida-dear	270	33	40	"About 11 years ago, I was a new driver enjoying a summer off from high school.  My car wasn't anything special--it was a four door '96 white Ford Escort that I named Bessie. Bessie didn't have electric locks or windows, but she was a great car to learn on.  I had a CD player installed and couldn't be happier with my newly found freedom. 



It took a few months after getting my license, but my parents had finally given me permission to drive my friends around in my car.  I took full advantage and spent an entire day with three friends from high school. We went to the city pool for the morning and afternoon and then relaxed in the evening by watching movies, vegging, and generally pretending that we were cooler than we really were. I had picked up everyone that day and even dropped everyone off at home after a perfect day. 



The last friend that I dropped off lived out in the country and it was already after midnight by the time I started home.  The winding road had no street lamps and I passed farm after farm and even thick woods. I put 'The Eminem Show' in my CD player and turned up the volume because that shit was cool and made me feel like a badass.



 I was being cautious about animals in the road, but a long summer day spent mostly in the sun was making me tired.  As I approached the STOP sign, I was almost home. 



I stopped the car, looking out into the darkness and let the music play. I could feel the tiredness in my face and legs--that almost floating feeling you get only after a long summer day spent in the sun and water.  I slowly pushed the gas petal and started to turn left.



My car had only moved a couple of feet when I saw a figure with arms outstretched, grasping at the passenger side of my car.  I released a blood curdling scream.  I didn't even know that I was capable of making such a noise, but it belonged in the a B horror movie.  I could see what he was wearing, but I never saw his face. I only knew he was trying to get into my car and was grabbing at the door handle.  It wasn't until now that i realized that every single door in my car was unlocked.



 I floored the gas and the car wailed along with me as it went up the hill.  I was in a complete panic and turned on my blinker as I turned left onto my street like a complete idiot.   My house is the first house on the left and I barreled into the driveway .  I grabbed my stuff and pushed the locks down on all of the doors.  I ran out of my car, through the yard, and clawed at the front door as I tried to find the lock with my key. My mom opened the door and I pushed my way inside. 



My mother saw the horror on my face and I frantically explained to her what happened.  I described his clothes--an old, purple t-shirt with pinkish bleach stains and a light wash pair of jeans with frayed holes. The skin on his arm looked like that of an older man that has spent much time in the sun--it was slightly wrinkled with a leathery appearance and had freckles.  It was a blessing and a curse that I didn't see his face. 



My mother called the cops and asked if there had been any accidents in the area. If someone needed help, they would have likely shown themselves in my headlights and waved during those moments spent at the STOP sign. There were no accidents reported. My mom explained the situation and they said they would send a patrol car to check out the area.  My mom was skeptical of my story and checked my eyes and smelled my breath for booze. She of course found no hint of teen shenanigans and sent me to bed. I tried my best to sleep, but the incident was fresh on my mind. 



In the morning, my mom said that she had called the cops again to see if there were any accidents last night or any other reports of something similar as my story--nothing.  She made a comment about how I was probably just tired and hallucinated the ordeal.



She sent me out to go grab the Sunday paper. I walked down the driveway past my car and what I saw horrified me.  In the dust and dirt on my car, there were hand prints and hand streaks across my passenger side door and hood. 



Edit: TL;DR  A man ran out of the woods and tried to get into my unlocked car as I was driving. He left handprints and streaks in the dust.  "	t5_2t3t8	True
1361789369.0	196qbf	This could have ended badly. Stupid decisions on my part.	drayb3	269	35	26	"Reading all these stories made me remember this incident from when I was around 9-10 years old. This happened in northern NJ back in the mid '90s.

My parents had gone out for the evening, and I was alone at home with my younger brother and sister, who were about 6 and 1, respectively, at the time. This is one of the first times that I had even been left home alone with them, and I was excited about the responsibility of watching my younger siblings and taking care of the house.

I remember that my siblings were asleep in their rooms and that I was watching TV in the living room - this is around 10pm. All of the lights in the house were out, except for a small lamp in the front room of the living room where I was.

I got up to go to the bathroom, which is on the other side of the house, and when I walked by the dark dining room I noticed that there was a light on near the street. This is unusual, because there was only one street light on my block and it was at the opposite end of the street from my house. I peeked out the window in the dining room and saw a gold BMW parked in front of the house. The car stayed there for about 2 minutes before driving off. I went to the bathroom and went back to watching TV, shrugging the whole thing off.

I went back to watching TV, this time with all of the lights in the house off. About 10 minutes later, I noticed lights outside the house again. This time I started to get nervous, as my parents wouldn't be home until around midnight. I peeked out the window again, and it was the same BMW. Only this time, they switched the headlights off. I waited for a few minutes, just watching them, and I was able to see that there were 2 white guys in the car, looking at the house. I'm still sure to this day that they didn't see me.

I started getting really nervous and was not at all thinking clearly, as I should have definitely called the police. Instead, being a 10 year old kid who had watched Home Alone far too many times, I decided to grab my sling shot and run upstairs to my parents room, where I had a clear view to the street in front of the house - the street is about 30 feet away across the front yard.

I grabbed several rocks from my rock collection, cracked the window open, and fired 2 or 3 rocks at the parked BMW, hitting it each time. The car flipped its lights on and the guys in it peeled out. They didn't come back.

As soon as my parents got back I told them what happened and they called the police. I remember my parents telling me that the police confirmed that there had been a few break-ins in the area and that these guys may have been casing the house. 

Luckily, I've never experienced anything like that since then."	t5_2t3t8	True
1345409971.0	yhkz4	I Never Want to See Her Cry	LNMcrazymagnet	296	60	61	"I had started a new job at a nearby grocery store when I was sixteen. It was my first job, and unfortunately for me, in one of the worst neighborhoods. Growing up in a shitty city this didn't bother me as much. What a strange bunch of people I met because of that job. Being a girl, naturally they put me on the register. I hated people and much rather have stocked shelves, but I wasn't about to turn down an actual job. 

The customers were strange enough, although I will get into that another time. I naively thought the shady customers would be the worst of what I would have to deal with. I was very wrong. 

The other employees were average people just trying to make a living. Mostly girls my age, and a few older guys as baggers. We all got along decently enough and no one really stood out. 

One of the guys, Jason (I believe he was about twenty one at that time), and I really hit it off. We would joke around while doing our jobs. He was an assistant manager, but would also occasionally bag for my line. We talked about music and TV. He was a huge Family Guy fan, so we would quote it back and forth and be silly. 

Then I started to hear strange things about Jason. Nothing specific. Apparently a lot of the girls found him creepy. I didn't understand why. He was never lewd with me at all. I suppose it occasionally slipped into flirty, but never alarming. I brushed it off. I'm not one to judge people simply based on the opinions of others.
 
So this went on for about a month. One night my friends were going to the book store for one of the Harry Potter book releases. I was a fan, but had no money. I went along anyway cause I was 16 and cool and totally out at midnight. My friend drove; I didn't have a car. 
I get a call from Jason. 

“Hey, wanna meet up?”

“Err...well, I'm at the bookstore if you wanna come by here. I'm just with a couple friends.”

“All right!”

So Jason shows up...a bit later than anticipated. We kinda part ways with my friends and go grab a coffee nearby. (We walked there as it was next door.)
We sat chatting for a bit outside. I get a text from my friend. She seems worried about me because she didn't know Jason. I assured her he was fine and that I would give her a heads up if I planned on getting murdered. 

Jason starts getting pissy cause I'm on my phone texting. I apologize and tell him it was just my friend being stupid. Not a big deal. 

“Hey do wanna come to my apartment and watch some Family Guy?”

“Err...I don't know...”

He looked hurt by my hesitation. 

“I don't want to leave my friends. That'd be rude.” 

“I came all the way here...I didn't think we were just going to hang out here all night.” He's getting pushy. A side of him I hadn't seen before. I'm nervous, but I have my phone. I eventually give in, I think, what's the harm? I'm an indestructible teenager of course with a man who is five years older than me. Seems totally safe! (Sarcasm, my dear readers.)

I honestly can't say why the hell I agreed to go. Adventure? Spontaneity? Testing fate? I really don't know. But before I knew it we were in his truck. He handed over something to me when we first got in. It was a little shot glass with my name on it and some dolphins. 

“I got this for you when I was in Florida.”

“Oh...thanks.” I smiled, but it couldn't have been convincing. We were friends at work, but not at the gift giving point. I stare nervously out the window the entire way. His apartment was a good half hour away. (I had no idea it was so far or I might have said no.) 

About ten minutes from his place, we get stopped at a police check point. They were there just to make sure no one was drunk and were stopping all cars in a line on the road. 

I remember thinking, 'I should get out. I should get out of the truck. I should ask the policeman to take me home. I shouldn't be here. This is bad.'

The policeman shined his flashlight at our eyes and with a  wave of his hand we were off again. My stomach churning. 

The building was huge. I didn't think his apartment was going to be in a such a giant complex. We headed inside. In the elevator, I became extremely dizzy. I stared at my feet, whilst nearly swaying. 

“Are you okay?” He asked.

“Yeah...heh...just don't like elevators.”

His apartment was small. Well kept, I guess. Nothing spectacular. I take a seat on his couch, hoping to regain some of my stability. We make awkward small talk and he shows me some stuff around. As I'm sitting on the couch he comes out of his bedroom with two fucking katanas. NOPE! I IMMEDIATELY freak the fuck out.

“No. Put those away now. PUT them back.” I tell him, loudly and sternly.

He laughed, thinking my fear was a joke. “What? Aren't they cool?”

“Yes. Very nice. Now put them away or I will walk out right now. And don't bring out any more dangerous or weird shit.” I have no idea where my sudden braveness came from, but I liked it. 

He giggled and put away the katanas (thank fuck), and sat next to me on the couch. He puts on Family Guy and swings an arm around my shoulder. Fine. Whatever. As long as he doesn't kill me, I can deal with an arm on the shoulder. My whole body is completely stiffened up at this point and he puts his hand under my chin, turning my head and lips towards his lips. Fuck that. 

I stand up. 

“No. I can't do that. I want to leave. Bring me home.”

He looks like a combination of hurt and pissed off. Sullenly he gathers his things and without saying a word walks to the car. I am trotting behind, keeping a distance between us. 

Silently we ride the thirty minutes back to my house. When we pulled up, I turned to him and I fucking apologized. I'm so pissed that I apologized to that creep. I felt that it was MY fault. That maybe I had led him on somehow. 

He didn't respond. He looked nearly in tears. I got out, and got inside. Sent my friend a text letting her know I was okay. Locked up the doors and went to bed. It had been the strangest night of my short life. 

Unfortunately the strangeness didn't end there. I abruptly quit my job. I hated it anyway, and I couldn't bear to see him around. I deleted his number and stopped responding to his texts. And he disappeared. As far as I knew. A few friends told me he had asked about me and I told them not to say a goddamn word about me to him. 

Years pass...I believe I was about twenty. I just got a Facebook account and had a couple close friends on there. Out of nowhere, I get a strange friend request. I immediately dismiss it. 'Who the fuck is this guy?' I thought because the name didn't ring any bells. The next day, it hit me. It was him. Jason. I had heard his last name once or twice before, but it WAS him. The profile picture wasn't a picture of him. It was this face: http://i.imgur.com/gEHJe.jpg

His profile was mostly private, except for the status updates (I'll get to those in a minute). I wanted to see if it was him for sure. Figuring he MUST have other photos I accepted his friend request, with intentions to immediately delete him after. I just wanted full access to see what he had been up to if it was really him. 

He had no other photos. Just that face. He had NO other friends. A shiver went down my spine, and still to this day I get anxiety thinking about it. My head is spinning. I'm reading down his numerous statuses. Who the fuck was he writing these for?! He had NO FRIENDS on Facebook. It didn't take long for me to realize who they were for...

“I miss her. I need her. Her smile.”

“I want to hold her. I never want to see her cry. I will kill myself before ever hurting her.”

And a bunch of long winded bad poetry. I felt sick. My head felt clouded. My heart was racing. After nearly five years he still thinks about me. Obsessing over me. I blocked him. My mind was everywhere. He had dropped me off at my house before...he KNEW where I lived. Has he ever waited outside? Has he ever watched me? Is he still alive? His statuses got more and more suicidal. I was reading his reality slipping from his fingers. I felt guilty. I hated that I caused someone pain. I hated that I sent someone into such a spiral of depression and fixation. 

About six months later his statuses stopped. I unblocked him briefly because my guilt was gnawing at me. What if he killed himself? I should have helped. I needed to know he was okay. I'm weird. This guy that caused me so much anxiety, and fear and distrust...I worried for. I sent him a message. A simple, “Hey, what's up?”

To my surprise he responded. Good. He was alive. Maybe he just stopped obsessing and got over me and feels fine now. I tried to lie to myself. 

He spills. It's like he had bottled up so much in the past five years that it all came out at once. He apologized for how things happened. He apologized for jeopardizing our friendship. It was weird. More of that nonsense and then he asked if we could still be friends. 

I didn't know this man anymore. I was older and smarter at that point. I really wanted nothing to do with him, I just didn't want someones death on my hands. I figured honesty was the best policy. 

Paraphrasing, as I don't remember exactly what I said but it was to the effect of, “Listen, I'm going to be honest. I contacted you because after reading some of your alarming updates I wanted to know you were okay.”

To this day, I haven't gotten a response back. His profile disappeared. That was three years ago. I don't know what ever happened to him. I really hope he got the help he desperately needed. 


(I'm using a throwaway, because I have many creepy stories that I don't want to be tied to with my regular account. I'm still afraid of Jason, where ever he is.)

Sorry, it was so long. 

**TL;DR: Creepy stalker doesn't care for Harry Potter. Prefers Family Guy and katanas.**

1331181423.0	qmvwe	How I attacked my attacker.	Entraya	283	45	41	"It all started when I was about 9 years old. I had a friend in primary school that lived very close to me on my street and I would go to her house often. She had two older brothers, one was in his 20's and the other was 16. 

I used to train to be a gymnast, so I was very thin and my parents would often drop me at my friends house after gym. I would be still in my gym clothes, usually lycra shorts and a middrift tank top and one hot day I took my jacket off. Her 16 year old brother (lets say his name is John) walks in and sees me in my gym clothes. He just stops and stares at me and then asks if he can show me and my friend (lets say Jane) something. He takes us into his room and closes the door and starts showing us his pokemon cards. I like pokemon so we chilled there for about 15mins, but Jane is acting really nervous and keeps saying she wants to go and play on the trampoline. I give in and we go I say thanks for showing us the cards and we head outside. 

A few weeks later he asks if we want to watch some pokemon in his room and we go in. This time he locks the door, I didnt think anything of it but Jane starts to freak out. He tells her to shut up and undress. She undress straight away, like she has done this before. I am like WTF is going on and he tells me if I don't get my clothes off he will tell on me for being  slut. Now being only 9, this somehow seemed legit to me. I thought oh my god, my parents are going to think I was being bad and I'm going to get in so much trouble so I undress. I try to cover myself with the sheets on his bed, but he pulls them away and tells Jane and I to stand on his bed and dance. Jane refuses and he pulls out a length of rope with a bolt tied to the end. He swings it over his head and threatens to hit us and tell everyone we're skanks with it if we dont. She starts to cry and we get up and dance as best we could (having no idea how to sexy dance) he sits back and watches, doesnt do anything just watches. After a while a door closes somewhere in the house and he tells us to get dressed and then tells us to get out. 

The next time he told us to come to his room, I said no, but I was in front of his mum and when she asked why I couldn't say so I went with him. After we went in he told us to undress and then told Jane to put her clothes back on because she was fat and he liked me better (she was kinda chubby and I was so thin people thought I was sick) He told me to dance again and then we left.
This went on till I was about 10 maybe 11, all the while I believed I was in the wrong and if I told I would get in as much trouble as he would or he would really hurt Jane. Then the day came, where seeing me dance naked wasn't enough, he had just turned 18 and told me to sit on a chair by his bed. I got up and walked over to me with his dick out and almost picked me up. He put me on the bed and laid on top of me, I knew what was coming. I reached down the side of the bed to the metal baseball bat that I seen there many times before and shoved him as best I could. He sat up and said “I was hoping you would fight” and when he came back down I hit him in the head with the bat. He fell back and fell off the bed and leapt up. At this point I was seeing red and didn't care if I got in trouble and I brought the bat down hard on the arm he was shielding himself with and hear d a crack. I then started beating the ever living shit out of him. I told him if he ever touched me or Jane again I would tell everyone what he did and I left. It wasn't until after I got home and washed the blood off myself that I thought, shit how is going to explain being beaten to a pulp without me getting in trouble or telling people what he did. Turns out he thought about this to and living in a “Queenslander” house (on stilts) there was a very long metal staircase at the front of the house. He laid at the bottom and when his parents got home said the Fight Club classic “I fell down the stairs” I found out from Jane that he had fractured his right arm, two ribs and his nose was broken. They moved about 6 months later and I've never seen him or Jane again. I hope, for his sakes, we dont meet again."	t5_2t3t8	True
1374487873.0	1isy9i	Man on my lawn	throwawaycart	273	40	32	"This happened about 1 year ago. To be clear, I live with my mother, 2 brothers, and father. My Dad is a truck driver, so he is gone constantly. My other brother was visiting his girl friend in Peru when this all happened. It was just the 3 of us. 

Anyway, one particular night around 12, I was heading to bed. I decided to get a glass of water, so I headed back downstairs. While drinking the water, I decided to look out the tiny window my door has and I noticed a shadow in my front yard. 

At first, I thought I was seeing things, but I decided to keep looking. There definitely was a man out there. I wasn't sure what to do. Mainly because he was just out there. He wasn't doing anything like trying to break in. I stood there watching him for a good 20 minutes. In those 20 minutes, he didn't move a muscle.

Then I noticed another man, come out of fucking nowhere. From what I could see, it seemed like they were talking. Anyway, a minute or 2 goes by and both men are gone. 

They moved to the side of my house, and jumped my fence to get into my back yard. I freaked out, and woke up my mom and brother. I should have woken them up to begin with, but I didn't want to make a mountain out of a mole hill. We called the cops, but at this point in time, there were a couple of car accidents, so it would take them 20-30 minutes to get to my house.

We locked ourselves in my mom's room and waited; hoping they wouldn't come in.  While waiting we heard our garage door open. We started to hear things being thrown around in the garage. They were in there for a good 15 mins. The cops finally showed up at this point and arrested both the men. 

Turns out, they were both really strung out on drugs. I learned my lesson though; call the cops immediately if you see something suspicious. You never know what might happen. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1372355313.0	1h6wrx	My mom was an accidental creeper.	Greenbeancarrot	298	64	24	" Okay this isn't actually that creepy or scary, but I think that it was pretty hilarious and was probably scary to the other person in this story.

 In 1990 my mother was going home after getting some dental work one day. She was on scooter stopped at a stop street when this rather handsome man approached her, asking for directions. Nothing is weird about this as my mother's hometown (also mine) was pretty hard to navigate if you were an outsider. My mom smiled and turned her head and began to talk, being the friendly woman she is. 

 I mentioned at the beginning that she had some dental work done. Specifically a root canal. She looked pretty normal when her mouth was closed, but she was under heavy anesthesia. When she began to talk she started pouring saliva from her mouth and her words were all jumbled and jacked up. The guy was so surprised he tripped over his bike and fell over. Then he hopped on and hightailed it out of there.
My mom was very offended and told me she hope he got lost.

He probably did.

1373902185.0	1icedt	Ryan	VictimlessCrime	275	40	47	"Another story on this subreddit made me think of one from my past. I was a very naive 18-year-old girl, convinced I was in love. My boyfriend was a real winner. He was 22, with no job, and spent much of his time partying with friends. He had so many friends. I took his popularity as a sign that he was a nice, trustworthy guy. I was wrong.

My older brother knew my boyfriend (they were in the same class in high school). He told me to stay away from him because he was abusive. I took this as my brother just being overprotective. I ignored his warnings. After a few months of dating though, I learned his true colors. It started out with him hitting or breaking things when he got angry. One time, when I came out of work a few minutes late, he LOST IT. I'm not exaggerating when I say ""lost it,"" either. As soon as I got in the car he started screaming at me. During the argument, he even ripped the side mirror off of his car and threw it at me. It made no sense to damage his own property or why he was so mad. This just showed how irrational he was. He didn't actually lay his hands on me until a few weeks later.

I was at his apartment until about 1am. I told him I had to go home and he pinned me down on the ground. I was 18, and still living at home. My parents didn't allow me to stay overnight at his house (I know it was a stupid rule, but they still supported me financially, so I obeyed). He knew this. He held me there for almost 10 minutes. I begged him to get off of me because he was hurting my arms. He just went on and on about how he loved me but I didn't appreciate him.  After I finally agreed to stay, just to get him off of me, he let me go. I ran for the door but he caught me. He literally punched me in the face. I remember being terrified. I stayed. That was the first of many physical fights, or should I say beatings. Typing it out makes me feel embarrassed that I even put up with it. We were together for almost 2 years after this. Shortly after that night, I moved in with him.

After walking on egg shells throughout the rest of our relationship, scared to say or do the wrong thing around him, I had finally had enough. He had been out late with his friends, which is something that happened 3-4 nights a week. He came home , wasted, and wanting to have sex. I was asleep and remember being woken up by him on top of me. I pretty much just laid there and let him do what he needed to do. He was too drunk to finish though and took it out on me. He started screaming at me and choking me, to the point that I almost blacked out. I was struggling to get away from him and he broke my arm. After screaming in pain, he still didn't let up. Finally, he ended up passing out. I called my mom, who came and picked me up. She took me to the hospital, then home to her house. I had my boyfriend arrested and a restraining order placed (which did nothing).

He called and texted me so many times. The messages ranged from threatening to kill me to how much he loved me and promised he would change. After ignoring him for a few days, he came by my parent's house. My older brother and dad threatened to beat his ass if he ever came around again (come to find out, my brother did end up beating him up pretty good a few days later). He continued trying to contact me for months, even coming by my job. One day, when going on my lunch break, I was walking to my car. He was sitting IN my car. I don't know how he got in there. I ran back inside and called my brother. By the time my brother got there, he was long gone. He contacted me for months after that as well (even after I got a new phone number, which I have no idea how he got). Finally, the calls stopped and he moved on. It's been about 3 years since I heard from him.  I heard he married one of his exes shortly after. I pray that she's safe. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1370866735.0	1g1gtw	Mom brought home a possible creeper...	Lizz124	286	52	18	"This took place probably about ten years ago, I think I was like 13 or 14 around the time. The only other thing I remember about the time frame is that it was around Christmas, because I spent the night rocking a santa hat. 

Growing up I was primarily raised by my single mother. She was good about keeping her dating life and mother life separate, I met very very few potential suitors. 

On the night this story takes place my mother and one of her best friends went out to have a girls night at a bar. Upon their return I got to see my mom in a very rare state (for her). Drunk. My mother and her friend were like two drunk giggly girls (which I found incredibly entertaining). They had also decided to bring home a male friend (never learned his name so I'll call him Charlie). 

They had met Charlie while at the bar, and I assumed that my mom and him had taken an interest in each other (I was old enough to understand that).  The drunk group primarily kept to my mom's room (not for sex, but as a courtesy to me) laughing and having a fun drunk time.

About an hour into their return, I was on my way to take out the trash (a walk from the kitchen, through the backyard, and to the side of the house) and as I am on my way back, closing the gate to the backyard, Charlie randomly appears out of nowhere. I wasn't even aware anyone saw me take the trash out, much less that this guy who had never been in my house before, managed to follow me out to the backyard. I was thrown off but politely said ""hey"". He asked what I was doing. After telling him i took out the trash he continued to try and make small talk with me. 

This went on for probably about twenty minutes. I was already creep-ed out by Charlie randomly following me into the dark backyard, but the longer he kept trying to force conversation, the more creep-ed out I got. I was too young, naive, and polite to just walk back inside and get myself out of this growing-creepier-by-the-second conversation. Luckily my mom came wandering into the backyard (I'm assuming she was looking to find where her new gentlemen friend had wandered off to), and she saw Charlie talking to me.. off on the edge of the dark backyard. 

bewilderment ensued. 

She came up and asked what was going on, in a tone that only I noticed was slightly alerted compared to her conversational tone. I explained about taking out the trash, after which she told me to do something or other that involved going in my room. I happily obliged. 

Within five minutes Charlie was gone, and all the drunken merriment of the night was gone. 

I could be wrong, but I just had that feeling, I just somehow knew what had run through my mom's head when she walked out and saw that seemingly innocent scene in the backyard. I saw all the dots just connect in her head. I saw the realization hit her of the big picture of this whole scenario. That Charlie's interest in my mom had really escalated upon finding out that she had a 13/14 year old teenage daughter. Why he was so eager to come home with my mom and her friend. 

My mother and I never spoke of this incident again. 

While this is the first time I am telling this story ever, and even though it happened almost ten years ago, its as clear in my mind as if it happened yesterday. I realize (and I am extremely grateful) that no 'lines' were actually crossed. But I will never forget that type of creep-ed out feeling I got that night. Nor my mom's subtle-on-the-surface-but-ready-to-kill-if-needed reaction to it. I am also incredibly grateful to have a mom that is so tuned-in to that 'mom-sense'. (which i don't in anyway mean anything negative towards parents who have had children get mistreated without picking up on the signs. I just meant as more of a comparison to a parent who knows whats going on and ignores it, pretends like its not happening, or even worse, blames the child for the mistreatment.)"	t5_2t3t8	True

Ir's a cheap place to live, and I hadn't met any other teenagers, so I'd taken to going for walks by myself, or with a stray cat I'd befriended, Frankie. There are 200 buildings in the gated community, each with 9 floors with 10 homes each, but somehow the gate still made everyone believe it was safe. 

I went walking with Frankie maybe two weeks after moving in, going further than usual and eventually getting lost. It was the later half of sunset when Frankie smelled something and went between parked cars. I followed him when two men came up beside me, cornering me. 

They were late-20s, black and built, one much larger than the other. The leaner one spoke, asking me why I'd moved between cars, was I hiding from them? Was I scared? I told him no, I was just getting my cat. He asked my name and age so I told him nervously, adding on a year and claiming to be 18. He told me I looked scared, that my body language, crossed arms and a stiff back gave me away. It was dark out. He asked me if I would be his friend and when I told him no thank you, he grew angry, ""it's because I'm African, isn't it, girl? You think I'm going to take you home and hurt you!"" I told him ""No, of course not, I'm just...not looking for a friend"". I was terrified at that point and he could tell. He asked if his large friend was scaring me, saying he'd send him away so we could be alone. He turned to the other man and spoke quickly in French, not knowing I could understand. Having taken a class for a few years, I caught 'wait around the corner, I'll call you"". I told him multiple times I had to go home and it made him mad, saying I was a rude girl. When I was impolite, he would get angry and move closer. He finally told me ""My wife is very far away. You are a beautiful girl, and you are going to come with me"". I had no phone, so I thought quickly and decided I'd have to talk my way out of this. 

He was clearly unstable, the way he yelled at me for ""being rude"" when I said I didn't want to be his friend. I lied and told him I'd like to be his friend, but my father wouldn't approve and would be looking for me soon. He told me I had to come quickly. I told him I'd tell my father I'd be with a friend, and come be with him, ""tomorrow night I'll meet you here"". He agreed and asked my phone number, I told him I didn't have one, I'd call him. He asked if I had a pen and paper and when I said no, he was angry, ""You lied to me! You were not going to write down my number you liar!"" but I assured him ""of course not, I'd love to call you, I'm great at memorizing"". He recited his number and told me to repeat it, again and again, slamming his hand on a car when I got a number wrong, until I could recite it correctly. He moved back and let me walk away. 

I walked backwards away from him, fake smiling and turning into a nearby building and taking back doors out through buildings until I was home. I don't go out at night anymore. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1360089505.0	17y27y	What did my dog witness?	Bald_Sasquach	268	35	29	"This happened a few years ago, but I just discovered this subreddit so here goes:

My parents' house is on a pretty busy corner in an older neighborhood in Texas. They installed a fence years ago, but never got around to putting the mechanical gate across the driveway, so the back of the house is clearly visible from the side street and sidewalk. My senior year of college (out of state) my dad let his old college buddy move in after struggling to find work, and offered him a position at his office. Needless to say he got my room, so when I graduated and came back home I slept on the futon downstairs. I didn't mind since the downstairs was cooler in the summer and my dad refuses to use the A/C unit. 

One night after being home for a few months I wake up suddenly in the middle of the night. Our little shih tzu-maltese was awake on the foot of my bed, sniffing the air and wagging his tail excitedly as though someone were visiting our house. I glanced at the clock and did a double take when I saw it was exactly 3:33. I'm not the type that reads into paranormal stuff, but my girlfriend always weirdly makes a point of going to bed before 3:33 because it's ""the witching hour"" or something. Being woken up to such a situation was obviously a little discomforting, but my dog's next move freaked me right the hell out. 

Launching himself off the futon, my typically quiet and happy dog bursts out extremely deep barks and starts running laps of the room. I go ""Toby quiet!"" but he is in no condition to listen right now. He stands up to see out the open window across the room and goes absolutely apeshit howling and barking much more intensely than I've ever heard him. Torn between being creeped out and knowing that this fool's going to wake the whole neighborhood I sat there, heart racing in a cold sweat, unable to move for what seemed like half an hour.

Glancing back at the clock, I saw it had only been a minute or two and then I heard quiet footsteps outside the window. Completely mortified I listened and between the frantic barking I heard a tiny grunt, like someone being winded, but far away. More footsteps going away and then my mom came down the hall going ""Toby! Come on it's 3 in the morning!"" Toby came back to my side and licked my face worriedly for a few minutes until I turned on my phone's light and shined it out the window. I didn't see anything and I reeeallly didn't want to go out there so I went back to bed until the morning.

The next day I woke up to my dad outside the window saying to come check this out. 

For a little back story the house sits on two lots, essentially giving us a double back yard, about 80 feet from the road but still visible from the driveway. Against the back fence we have a rabbit hutch that at the time had one little rabbit in it. 

When I step outside there is a tail of blood and intestines across our back sidewalk to the driveway. There is white fur closer to the rabbit hutch, and the door is swinging open. Some goddamn lunatic grabbed my rabbit in the middle of the night and gutted her right next to my open window. As the dog watched. I heard her die."	t5_2t3t8	True
1344904613.0	y6bc3	Witness to an abduction.	beebsandbean	270	39	23	"The following is a friend's tale that I believe belongs here.

My friend Sam (female), lives a few blocks away from me. We don't live in a terrible neighborhood, although it used to be much nicer. Sam is out running after dark one night (not too late, I recall it being before 10 pm), when she sees a slow-moving car pull up to a woman who was walking on the other side of the street. Two men exited the car, and started attacking the woman! They dragged her, kicking and screaming, into the vehicle. My friend flipped out, as is to be expected, and called 911 on her cell. The police reacted pretty quickly and were able to locate the car using the description Sam gave them. They drove her by the stopped vehicle and had her identify the kidnappers, while she ducked down in back of the cop car. The officers said she probably saved the woman's life. We looked in the paper for a few days, but didn't see anything about the incident. Sam doesn't run alone at night any longer."	t5_2t3t8	True
1363154663.0	1a79l9	Chechnya's apparently really hardcore	G-zazz	264	34	30	"So about twenty minutes ago my mother came to my room to discuss my little sister's birthday party (she's turning eleven in two days!!) and she noticed that I was reading the Lets Not Meet subreddit. After informing her about the contents of the site, she decided to tell me a story of her own.

To start off, it would be wise to know that my mother was born and raised in a place in Russia near the Caucasus Mountains called Chechnya. This town was pretty crime-ridden and old fashioned, known for it's 'eye for an eye' policy (meaning that if you killed someone, you should expect your family members and/or yourself to be killed as payment). 

Another pretty important piece of information you should know is that my Russian side of the family was very involved in the mob. My great uncle was one of the leaders of a powerful mob back in the late sixties? I'll ask my mom for his last name, but i think it's pretty well known. I think it starts with a K..

My mom was about twenty when she decided that she'd spend her break from medical school near the Black Sea where she'll meet up with some of her friends. She decided she'd come a day early to have fun on the beach before meeting up with her friends. However, as she was sunbathing, she fell asleep and woke up with an awful heatstroke to the point that she was going to faint. 

She made it to the road and hailed for a cab for a few minutes until a vehicle that looked like one of those expensive private cars rolled up. I don't know if they're widely known, but they're basically taxis that look like regular cars...anyway, despite there already being a man in the car, my mother decided to try her luck, because it was either this or she would pass out on the street. 

They let her in, and it seemed as though everything was going fine until she realized they drove past the hotel she was staying at. Eventually, they got off the road and started driving into the woods, and that's when my mom kind of realized they probably weren't cab drivers. She had no weapons she could use, she was five feet tall and incredibly thin, all she was wearing was a bathing suit and a pullover dress, and she was still ill from the heatstroke. So she decided to use her words instead:

""I don't know if you know who I am, but I'm K------'s niece and my family's from Chechnya. You know that if you do anything to me, my family, especially my uncle will find you and kill you and your parents and any relatives you may have"" 

She just went on and on about her family and Chechnya's customs until the driver stopped the car and confirmed her statements, mentioning he knew some men in the army who knew her uncle and abided by the Chechen culture in that 'eye for an eye' sense. After coming to a silent, but mutual agreement, they drove her back to her hotel in complete silence and she never saw them again.

TL;DR: mom went into a strangers car and almost got killed but was saved because of her family and the fact that she's Chechen. 

[EDIT: so my mom told my grandma about this site yesterday, and she proceeded to tell me some stuff too, however, this story was a hell of a lot creepier in the sense that it involved me?? Heads up, I know that Nosleep has this sort of reputation of being 'not-so-true' every once in a while, but the story my grandma told me, and the followup afterwards is all 100% true. I'd put it on /r/LetsNotMeet  but there's not really anyone creepy.

1362006701.0	19cx53	gangs are afraid of houselights	Heywood_Floyd	272	42	38	"When I was a about 10 years old my family lived on this very shady/ghetto street in the middle of a small town. On this street, break-ins occurred frequently, drug deals took place constantly, and we had to replace our mailbox numerous times thanks to the brilliance of small-town homeboys who felt the need to smash Postal Service parcel containers in the middle of the night.

Anyway, one night I wake up to the sound of someone *pounding* on our front door. *Bang Bang Bang Bang!* My heart rate skyrockets. I glance at the clock, it's around 2 am. I peek out of my bedroom window and look down towards the driveway: three cars are idling, and there's a group of 5-6 people surrounding my door. I'm silently freaking out at this point. My father hears the bang on the door and runs to start flipping on lights in the house. I'm still at my window watching the group. I then hear a guy, outside, say ""Yo man, let's not do this."" in a very sorrowful voice, like they were about to do something utterly terrible. They slowly walked off our porch, got in their cars, and screeched out of our driveway and down the road.

I have no idea what they would have done, but since then numerous break-ins and subsequent murders have occurred on that street. We moved away soon after this happened."	t5_2t3t8	True
1355997080.0	155stz	my parents' best friend was murdered on their front lawn. [gory]	naivebear	289	59	46	"never thought to post this here because i've known about it as long as i can remember. it is 100% true and my mom carried a concealed handgun for over a year after this. she went to a ton of therapy and my brother has never been the same.

back in the mid-eighties, my parents lived in a new subdivision with only a few of the houses occupied on their street, including their friends nancy and milton. milton managed a retail store. recently, one of his younger female employees had had a bad break up with an abusive boyfriend. and one late night before closing, the boyfriend came into the store with a gun and threatened his ex-girlfriend and the other employee. he got away before the cops got to the store.

the next time that female employee was closing up, milton was working in the store as well. she asked him to follow her home to make sure the boyfriend wasn't waiting for her at her house. 

now this point and beyond is just speculation by the police.

the female employee was the last person to see milton alive. he left her house and proceeded to head home.

his car was found at the end of his and my parents' street... with bullet holes in it and the driver's side door open. 

his body was found lying over 100 yards away in front of my parents' house, stretched out between the street, the sidewalk, and the grass. 

he had been struck with an axe over 65 times, including a blow to the middle of his forehead which according to my dad, ""was split open like a watermelon"".

a neighbor passing by on an early morning jog found his body and called the cops. they knocked on my parents' door and asked if they knew anyone missing. my dad had to identify the body. and milton, who had blonde hair, now had a matted bloody mop on top of his head.

my dad said he couldn't tell that milton was blonde.

that day, the cops questioned the usual suspects but everyone had an alibi. the employee's boyfriend was nowhere to be found. he had left for a ski trip that morning.

the cops never found who did it.

and the worst is that my oldest brother, who was 10 at the time started having serious behavioral problems after that. his bedroom window was less than 15 feet away from where milton was murdered. when asked by a therapist if he saw anything that night, he couldn't remember. but for years after that, he and my other brother (who was 5 at the time) were afraid of passing by windows at night. my oldest brother's behavioral problems continued until early adulthood.

neither one of them ever said they saw anything, but the therapist always thought my oldest brother may have seen something but repressed it.



EDIT: found old police report, ctrl + f ""milton""; i'm guessing the ME determined the gunshot wound was a cause of death. although his other wounds were contemporaneous, so it's likely he was still alive.

1346309599.0	z2ei7	Two Pedos at the Mall	tinysaurus_rex	259	29	34	"This happened about 15 years ago, when I was 12 and my youngest brother was around 2. I was with my mom, my baby brother, my other brother (who was about 10 at the time), and a friend one weekend at the mall. It might have been around Halloween because I remember my baby brother was wearing some kind of cowboy thing with a hat. I should say that my brother was a REALLY cute baby so it wasn't unusual for random people to comment on it while we were out. 

We were in Burger King waiting on line when this guy walks in behind us, and almost immediately starts going on about how cute my brother is. My mom looked and said she also saw a woman with a baby standing near him, so she kind of just figured this guy was a dad and so she didn't think it was unusual. We eat, and forget about it, and go about shopping. We were in a CD store when we notice the guy again, but this time he was with another man around the same age.

They were both, it seemed, in their 40s or 50s. One was a little taller, but they were both chubby. The shorter guy wore glasses. There wasn't really anything distinct about them that would put them apart from anybody else, and I think that is the scariest part for me. They were talking to each other when they walked in behind us, and while we were shopping one of them stayed at the front of the store while the other one circled around us in the aisles towards the back. My mom says now that this was when she realized something was up, but she didn't want to say anything because she didn't want us to freak out.

So when we left the store, my mom took us towards the opposite end of the mall, keeping an eye out to see if the guys were still following us. And they were. We went into two or three more stores, and they were in each one, not even shopping for anything. Just looking at my brother, like pedo sharks. At this point, my mom pulled me aside and told me what was going on. I had also noticed them, but I was 12 and I wasn't really thinking it was anything weird, until my mom confirmed that something really sketchy was happening. We decide we're going to leave, since the parking lot was right outside and our car was close.

And sure enough the two guys start following us. My mom stopped, pretending to look in her purse for her keys, and they walked by us for a couple of minutes. Then one of them ""dropped"" something on the floor and stalled by pretending to look around for it. My mom looked at me and said, ""go find cops."" This mall is in an urban area right outside of the Bronx, and it's fairly small so it wasn't hard for me to find a couple of cops and tell them what was going on. I walked them back to where my family was, and I guess the two guys saw them because they jetted for the parking lot. The cops followed them, and my mom hauled ass back home. As far as I know, they got the plate number of the car the guys were in and it turned out to be registered to some 90 year old woman in Florida. That's all that really came of it though.

I don't know how scary this sounds to people who haven't experienced something like it. I know that it freaked me out that even a few years later I had nightmares about it, that the guys followed us home and murdered my family. My mom has said that was one of the scariest things that's ever happened to her. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1342595909.0	wqz8q	My teacher	officialgrejsimojs	258	32	57	"So when I was in my first year in high school, I had a teacher whose name was Dr. Johansson. Used to teach my class civics. He was a special fella, not like other teachers.
In the school I attended, teachers were often not close to students in a social way. They were simply there to teach and that only.

Dr. Johansson liked to keep contact with students and so he decided it would be a lot easier to do so if he had a Facebook account. He started adding people on Facebook from our school, and eventually started talking to them.
He often posted weird stuff on his wall, and commented weird things.

For example, one time he posted the song ""Straight Outta Compton"" by NWA, and wrote: ""All they say is nigger, nigger, nigger. I don't get it!""

Of course, some students commented and asked him why he had used the n-word so freely. He removed the post and apologized, blamed it on being drunk.
This was nothing.

He started talking to students, mostly boys, and he managed to find some students numbers and started sending them texts randomly. He would send stuff like: ""Do you need help with homework? You can come over to my place and I could help you out over a glass of wine"". And this he would say to teens that were **younger** than 18 years, so according to the law they are not allowed to drink. And he pretty much offered alcohol to minors. Remember, he's a civics teacher. He should know this stuff by heart. It's also morals, for God's sake!


Anyway, he never sent **me** a text, but he sent some weird texts to my friends. Later on, he decided to talk to me. This was a couple of weeks after he had started contacting students like this. He would speak to me on the Facebook chat. He would ask me things like: ""How do you get girls? Do you have a big dick? Do you often get to sleep with girls after your shows?"" (because I'm an artist), and I found these messages highly disturbing. They became worse: ""You must be such a stallion in bed! You are probably really good!"" and ""Enter the rabbit hole with me. Come on, I'll take care of you!"". I had no clue what the fuck that meant.

That was not everything! After a while, things started to get out of control. He started asking me out to go with him to the clubs (and I was not of age at this time), and he said he could get me into the clubs with no ID, and all would be well! Of course, I said no.

He then apparently got pissed at me and decided not to speak to me much after that I had turned him down a few times. He started talking to one of my near friends instead. It ended up with Dr. Johansson sending my friend a picture of his ass with the caption: ""Please, take me from behind, and take me hard"". Mind you, my friend was 17 at the time whilst Dr. Johansson was around his mid-thirties.

That was taken to court and Dr. Johansson got his little sentence. He was to do community service for a little while and then he was to pay my friend some fine. That was it. Dr. Johansson still works at a school today, and is totally accepted. I find that very wrong, people, very wrong. A man like that should not be able to get in that line of work again. Things could have gotten much worse than this!

By the way, I live in Sweden so the age of going to the club is 18, whilst the age of buying alcohol from a liquor store is 21. I know, weird laws.

That was my story. Sorry if it was a bit long. Tried to keep it as brief as I possibly could!"	t5_2t3t8	True
1370538821.0	1fsvdv	My Old Roommate was Unstable	Human_Gravy	267	35	22	"My roommate called himself Joseph even though his name was completely something different. He was an international student from China and his real name was too hard to pronounce for me. Right off that bat, I realized there were some funny ticks about Joseph that I chalked up to the cultural differences between us. His hygiene was questionable to say the least. I remember him showering once or twice a week. In the Florida heat, this isn’t going to work very well when your diet only consists of vegetables. Along with never bothering to clean the bathroom or his side of our shared living space, I can say that he wasn’t an ideal roommate. 

There are a few other eccentricities I could mention that are a little annoying but not very interesting. His main three faults were his constant religious preaching (I’m an atheist), his piano playing (Yes, he had a small piano put into our dorm room), and his addiction to World of Warcraft. He would spend entire nights on his computer until the early morning play the game. It got to be such a nuisance to hear the clicking of the mouse and the pounding on his keys. The light from the screen kept me up until I finally told him that it was bothering me. After that, he would play on his laptop in a study room and I was able to finally sleep again.

Despite all the annoyances, I thought Joseph was a pretty nice guy. He began to open up to me about his life. His family had lived in California and he decided he wanted to get away from them because they were overbearing and controlling. He had never had any friends before and had difficulties adjusting to social situations and the language barriers didn’t help him much with socializing and only made his schoolwork more difficult. Soon enough, we were having philosophical discussions about God, understanding women, and American society. 
I felt I learned a lot about him and I tried to help him by introducing him to my own friends and including him in my own activities but ultimately it proved to be too hard for him for adjust. I continued to be his friend and even printed sheet music from Final Fantasy 7 for him to play on the piano for me. He played magnificently and we actually began to enjoy living together. Everything went fine for a little while until one night I was awoken by a gentle shake.

*“I’m scared”*, Joseph whimpered into my ear waking me from a dead sleep. The alarm clock said it was 4:33 a.m. 

*“What’s the matter?”*

*“It’s complicate and you not understand*”, Joseph stammered in his broken English.

*“It’s really late, man, what’s your issue?”* 

It took a few moments for him to reply. I was used to the pauses for him to find the words he wanted to express himself with.

*“I lose Arena partner tonight”*

*“What does that mean?”*

*“God sad me”*

*“Huh?”*

*“You PVP with me”*

*“What the fuck are you talking about?”*

*“PVP, Warcraft”*

*“You want me to play World of Warcraft?”*

*“Yes”*

*“No, I don’t have time for that stuff”*

This is the point where everything went downhill. Looking back, it didn’t occur to me that he wasn’t accustomed to dealing with rejection because after that night, I barely saw him anymore. Whenever he came in, he wouldn’t say hello or talk to me. He’d pick up whatever he needed and he would immediately leave the room. I tried to confront him many times but he never responded. This continued for a little while longer until during the middle of the night he woke me up again.

*“Sorry I no talk long time”*

*“Um, okay. You could have waited until tomorrow morning, man”*

*“You know Virginia Tech?”*

The Virginia Tech Massacre is what he was referring to since it had happened recently. I don’t exactly remember the day he mentioned this to me but Virginia Tech had recently happened.

*“Yeah, what about it?”*

*""I know how he feel. No friends. English no good. Lonely. People make fun. I no do same is because God and Warcraft”*

This sent a chill up my spine. While I knew that he was completely harmless it sounded like a cry for help. With everything that I knew about him and how behavior had become somewhat erratic, I thought it was better safe than sorry.

*“Maybe you should talk to the school counselor. She should be able to help you out if you are having any issues”.*

*“I try soon. Play Warcraft. Night”*

He gathered his laptop, mouse, and headset and left the room. I stayed up a little longer not feeling so sleepy anymore. The next morning, he wasn’t in his bed. I called him on his cell phone and he didn’t answer. He actually didn’t return for a full week and never contacted me despite my daily calls and texts. To say I was afraid for him was an understatement. I didn’t know if he had committed suicide or had picked up and left. I went to the school counselor about Joseph’s behavior and his comments to me. She told me to report it to campus authorities and they said they would search for him. I also put in a room transfer request. This was becoming too much of a stress on my life. As much as I liked the guy, he had to sort out his problems.

A several days passed and Joseph hadn’t returned to the room. My room change request was denied and when I asked an RA about it they told me that it would be taken care of soon. Later that day, the RA and campus security entered my dorm room and began to gather Joseph’s belongings. When they opened one of his drawers, the security guard requested a local police officer come to the school over the radio. There was a handgun in the drawer. 

The police arrived and took the weapon from the drawer and drew up a report. They asked me if the weapon belonged to me, if I had known anything about it, and basically grilled me about why the weapon was in the room. I told them everything I have written here. The police took the weapon and security finished packing his belongings into the boxes. By the end of the day, Joseph’s side of the room was emptied and looked spotless like no one had ever lived there.

I attempted to contact him to tell him that I was worried about him and that people were looking for him. He never answered me back. The rest of the semester came and went but I never heard from him again. I tried to get information from the school counselor but she gave me the patient confidentiality explanation and was only able to tell me that Joseph had been found in a near-by park and he wouldn’t be returning to the school because of the policy of weapons on campus. 

I wish I knew how things turned out for Joseph but that’s where the trail of information ends for me. I’ve tried calling his last number but the phone number isn’t in service anymore and I lost it after my old crappy flip phone broke. 

As a side note, about two years later, I started playing World of Warcraft during the Wrath of the Lich King expansion and I found myself remembering Joseph and his addiction to the game. I created a character on every realm trying to find him or maybe a guild he belonged to. The only information I had about Joseph’s character was that he was a Paladin and he was with the Alliance. I spammed trade chat with the message:

*LF Pally Joseph from Room 2140 at UM. It’s your old roommate.""*

I was never able to find him or anyone who knew him.

1345561156.0	ykzaz	Samaritan task turned awkwardly creepy. Tale from a guy who wanted to help a woman on the side of the road.	verboseone	283	53	32	"I have a friend that I consider somewhat of a genius when it comes to anything science. He is one of the few in the field I know that searches for the answer when others can’t explain it. This friend looks a little bit like what Fox News would have you believe a terrorist looks like. His fascination with fire doesn’t help the terrorist image much. He is not always the brightest on picking up verbal or none verbal clues. He usually has no idea when he is being hit on by the opposite sex. Even if the girl where to say I really like you, something just wouldn’t click. More times than not this usually just ends on his friends and I badgering him for a few weeks. Occasionally it leads to a good story.    
    
He called me yesterday shortly after I got home and just had to come tell me a about this girl he met. Naturally I insisted he come on over and tell me about it…   
   
&gt;I was driving home and saw a woman in between two exits on the interstate. Thinking she probably needed a ride to the gas station and back to her car, which is out of sight; I pull over and ask if she would like a ride to the gas station.        
   
&gt;“Thank God!” she exclaims as she climbs in to the truck.      
   
&gt;I’m a little taken back by this, as I had only asked her if she needed a ride to the gas station. I never said climb on in or anything of the like.  Perhaps she is just socially awkward. I ask her “Which gas station would you like to go to?”   
   
&gt;“Atlanta.” She proclaims.       
   
&gt;Now that can’t be right.  We are in the city of Savannah. The city of Atlanta is a good five hours away.  Maybe she didn’t understand what I was asking. After all I sometimes stutter and don’t realize it. Again I ask, “What gas station would you like me to drive you to?”  I’m sure I didn’t stutter this time.      
   
&gt;“Atlanta.” She repeats.       
   
&gt;What the hell, this woman really wants me to take to Atlanta? I thought she needed gas.  “I’m not going that far, I can take you a few miles to my exit if you like.” I ask inquisitively.      
   
&gt;“You have pretty eyes, Daddy.”        
   
&gt;Things are starting to get weird even by my standards. This woman must be 20 years older than me.  I just wanted to be a samaritan and give her a ride to the gas station.  “I would appreciate it if you didn’t call me Daddy.” I respond.       
   
&gt;“What should I call you then Honey?”     
   
&gt;Did she really just use a term of endearment with a person she just met? “Call me Richard or Rick.”  This wasn’t my name, but it is obvious to me I shouldn’t give her my real name.        
   
&gt;“Sounds good Daddy.”            
   
&gt;Daddy?! Did I not just tell her to stop.  “Don’t call me Daddy. Where do you want me to take you?”     
   
&gt;“Atlanta.  Do you want me to blow you?” She said as if that would be enough to get me to drive a ten hour round trip.       
   
&gt;“No thanks.”     
   
&gt;“Do you have a girlfriend?”      
   
&gt;“Yes.”  I lied. I just had to find an excuse this loon might except for my not wanting to partake in his sleazy ways.    
   
&gt;“A wife?”         
   
&gt;“No, I just said I had a girl friend.” I guess I didn’t look like the faithful type.         
   
&gt;“Your girlfriend won’t know.”          
   
&gt;“I would know.”      
   
&gt;“I wouldn’t tell anyone.”          
   
&gt;“I would know.”  I bet I have more moral than any Christian.  We have been driving down the interstate for a little ways now. My exit is getting near. No way I’m dropping her off that close to my home.  “Are you in trouble? Would you like me to take you to the police department?”  Maybe if I mention police she’ll back off this BJ crap.          
   
&gt;“Savannah will be fine.”          
   
&gt;Wonderful! We just drove 10 miles out of Savannah.  I ask where in Savannah she would like to go.          
   
&gt;“Freds General Store.”          
   
&gt;Seriously? WTF? She wants to go to a dollar store? Whatever, I just want her out of my truck.  I pull up to the store front. She isn’t getting out.          
   
&gt;“Do you have $20?”          
   
&gt;“No. I never carry much cash.”          
   
&gt;“I need $20.”          
   
&gt;“That doesn’t change the fact I don’t have $20.          
   
&gt;“Just give me $20.” A moment of awkward silence falls in the truck. “I’m not asking for much. Just $20.”          
   
&gt;“Get out of my truck please.”          
   
&gt;“Give me $20 first.”          
   
&gt;“I don’t have it.”          
   
&gt;“Lets go the ATM then.” Seriously?! I was almost rid of her? “My daughter runs an escort service. You would like her.”          
   
&gt;“I’m not going to the ATM, I have a girl friend. Please get out.”  She starts to cry.  I have no idea why she is crying. “Are you in trouble with someone? I can take you to the Sheriff Station.” I just want to do the right thing.          
   
&gt;“I’ll call my daughter, we can get together and go to a hotel for $20.”          
   
&gt;A hotel for $20… I thought.  What kind of place is that going to be? Wait. No. “I have ten dollars. Will you get out of my truck if I give it to you?”          
   
&gt;“I need $20.”          
   
&gt;“I don’t have $20. I can give you $10 or take you to the police station if you want. Take it or leave it.”            
   
&gt;“Fine.” She grabs the money and gets out. As she is getting out she looks at me and says “You know I’m a hooker right?”.  I lock the door, and spin my wheels getting the fuck out of there as fast as possible.  It honestly never occurred to me she was a hooker.  I just wanted to give her a ride to a gas station.

Age: 19 at the time, 23 now

I've always had a fear of home invasions. I grew up in rough areas and it happened a couple of times when I was a child, and while it didn't mess me up it did leave a trickle of fear down my spine every time I thought about it. It's never been about being harmed, of being held at knife or gunpoint, if being attacked, but more a case of what would I do.

I found out when I was nineteen.

At the time I was at uni and living with my father who worked a night job as a security guard. We lived in a rough neighbourhood- the kind that appears on Top Ten Dangerous Suburb kind of lists. We'd been broken into a bunch of times, car windows smashed, and it didn't matter what kind of security we had, it never deterred people. But we left the doors locked, windows had dowling in place, and we did our best- we weren't wealthy.

The night this happened I was at home alone, as was usual, and had left the wooden back door open (fly screen locked) with the cat flap open waiting for the cat to come in. I was in my bedroom doing homework. The screen door made a very distinct sound when the cat flap swung and so when I heard the *cree-creak*, I lifted my head expecting to see Mr Sooky come wandering into my room but there wasn't any sign of him. No worries, he was probably eating dinner. I go back to my homework when I hear the *cree-creak* again. Okay, Mr Sooky might have the nickname Mr Insy-Outsy, but this is-

There's a man barely a foot behind me. 

I can remember my thought process very distinctly.

*Daddy didn't say the plumber was coming around.*

My desk was crammed into the corner of my room. To my left was a window and behind me a chest of drawers. The man was to my right, my only exit.

*The plumber doesn't come around at nine PM.*

I'm very small. 155cm on a good day and at the time no more than 60kgs soaking wet. This guy was easily hitting 180cm and probably tipping the scales at 100kgs.

*The plumber knocks.*

He was bleeding on my carpet. There was a slash on his face and another on his arm.

*This isn't the plumber.*

And that was when it hit me. This man had come into my house, probably breaking the lock on the back door (the screen had been cut open), and cornered me in my room.

I started to cry. Not just cry but sob. I didn't know what to do, my mind just went blank. I brought my feet to my chest and tried to curl into a ball and just immediately started to sob.

He told me, 'I knocked on the front door.' He said, 'I knocked on your window.'

My father had given me pepper spray- it was behind my laptop. I had sewing shears- they were beside me. I had a knife on a plate where I had fruit.

I thought to myself, *if I'm nice to him, I'll get out of this alive.*

So I offered him my fruit. I'd been slicing up apples, starfruit, I had some strawberries. I gave him the plate, still crying. I noticed he had a phone sticking out of his pocket. While he was distracted- what kind of victim offers the attacker fruit?!- I pointed to the phone.

'I'm going to call the police, okay?'

While he held the plate I very carefully took his phone from him. It was stupid, I know, and if I had been thinking clearly I wouldn't have done it. Fuck, if I was watching this as a film I would have been screaming at this stupid girl. But I wasn't thinking. I was stupid, I was shaking and crying and honestly he could have gutted me like a fish and fucked my intestines. Right then I was living my worst fear. 

Unsurprisingly he grabbed me then and pulled me from my desk chair. I had his phone, though.

'I'm going to call the police now,' I repeated and I did.

He was still bleeding, though, and holding the plate of fruit so I guess he was disorientated. I called the police and explained what had happened. While talking to them I picked up some scrap fabric and gave it to him. He grabbed me again and I burst back into tears. 

The man on the line kept trying to reassure me but also told me to go along with whatever the man was asking me to do. 

That was when he started kissing me.

About ten, fifteen minutes had gone by. It felt half that time and twice that time. I kept crying and the man kept telling me it would be okay and the emergency operator told me it would be okay and I think at some point I probably literally pissed myself. 

The police were suddenly at my door. They started hammering at it and I heard the back gate smash as they came into the back yard. The man yelled at me to not let them in, the emergency operator told me to, I went back and forth for ten seconds before I ran. I was a runner at that time- I had strong legs, and something, for two seconds in my head, snapped. I stomped on his instep, and it bought me enough time for him to let go of my wrist and me to sprint the three meters across the living room floor to pull the door open. I immediately sprang back and landed on my tailbone when four police offers- all over 200cms- came flying in through the front door and another three from the back.

I remember thinking it funny they had lasers on their tasers.

I curled back into a ball and sobbed as they struggled with him. He fought, but I was just sitting there, face to my knees and dry heaving. My phone in my bedroom was ringing; at some point I'd hung up the man's phone and had given my number to the operator. They dragged the man out and the head policeman spoke to me as they contacted my father.

There had been an altercation two blocks away. The man had gotten into a fight over something- drugs, I guess?- and had smashed a bloke's head into a car window in front of an unrelated house. When the home owner came out to ask what was going on, the man had thrown a baseball bat into his head. He ran and wound up in my backyard. He had a pocket knife and had cut through the screen door.

This wound up leading to me becoming a very anxious young woman for a while, but since then I've had another home invasion- this time I was very calm, but only because my father was in the house. I also had my home broken into and had belongings stolen while I slept. When I woke up I was very, 'oh, bother,' about it.

I was asked to attend a court hearing about all this four months later; the man never turned up. 

If anyone wants proof, I still have the court hearing documents but my statement has been lost through the years."	t5_2t3t8	True
1348111607.0	106ady	Christmas and a Corpse	sociallyawkwardpoet	254	26	25	"Sigh....Ok, so I've known for a while I wanted to submit this story but felt odd about it since I am still friends with some of this guys family and would feel like a total shitbag if it was seen. However....I've been home with the kids reading today and getting pissed that I had read all of your stories and was fresh out of creepy material. So, be a part of the solution I guess. Here we go. 

I am a member of the Slam Poetry scene. Basically it is an excuse to get people to listen to performance poetry by adding a competitive element to things. After running through the small scene in my city and wanting to branch out and push my career further I started visiting places within driving distance that I could spit. This lead me to Charlotte, NC. 

I started at their local ""team"" venue where you compete to be a part of squad that goes to a national competition every year.  I was doing well and was accepted into the local crew pretty readily. 

This lead to longer stays and features at some of the other venues in the city. I started going to one that was particularly popular and good for selling cds. That's where I met him. 

He worked as a bar back. Occasionally got on stage and shared, frankly shitty, poems. He was the brother of the host and everyone knew and liked him. 

He slowly started flirting with me more and more. Although in my loose days, searching for acceptance and love everywhere, something always kept me leery. I'd gladly accept the drinks he sent over, smoke his weed with the group in the stock room between sets and hang out at parties and events. 

I always had the tickle in my gut warning me not to get to close but over a year or two we continued to become friends. 

After a while, he started calling/texting more often. Poking me on fb daily, sending messages about wanting to be more than friends that he wanted to find a ""snow bunny""  (Yes I'm white, he is black) and settle down. Again, I never entertained it. There was something gnawing at me. The crazy in his eyes too hard to miss. 

I eventually moved to Denver to take a position teaching poetry and work at a friends law firm.... The second christmas I was there I got the call.

A friend from Charlotte relayed the following. 

He had found his white girl and gotten married. They seemed happy at first but slowly began fighting more and more. It spilled over into the venue and often they had to be separated by friends from physically attacking one another in public. One friend, later thinking back, remembers the last time she saw them together, him pushing his wife followed by her throwing a drink in his face and scratching his neck deep enough to draw blood. She said after the couple had been dragged away from each other she sat with him and smoked a cigarette. She says she laughed and said ""You guys are going to kill each other.""

 Around christmas last year. His wife just stopped coming to the bi-weekly events they both attended regularly. He explained it away that they were on a break. 

Time goes by. No one really questions that they hadn't seen or heard from her in a while. Thinking she was breaking from the whole scene in order to put distance between herself and her husband. Her parents, however, hadn't heard from their daughter since the Thanksgiving dinner. They would call him he would say everything was fine and blow them off. This continues until a week after Chirstmas, knowing their daughter would never miss a holiday without atleast a call. They call the police send them to the couples home for a 'well body' check.

The cops arrive. Knock on the door and are let in. They ask him where she is, he reply's she is in the bedroom. He shows them to the room and there she lay, dead for weeks rotting in their bed. Oh and he killed her little dog too.....

During this time he had been attending events hosting hip hop nights even publishing a blog on ""Making a marriage work"" on one of the local organizations site. Never once letting on that every night he was going home and sleeping with his murdered wife. 

The sickest part of it all; He has a child from another relationship. A daughter whom he gets to celebrate every other holiday with. That Christmas they opened gifts, had dinner, cuddled up on the couch and watched movies less than 100 ft from her decaying stepmother. 

I don't know what would have happened if I'd ever had taken him up on his offer to date, but I do know me and my gut are going to stay on speaking terms and I will Always, Always listen.

1364359505.0	1b3dkj	I was able to save myself, but other kids weren't so lucky.	JacobtheRed	271	45	25	"This is a comment I made on a askreddit post. Another user thought this sub might find it interesting. Slight edits of original comment for clarity and added some afterthoughts.

 When I was about 10 or 11 there was this neighbor boy who was 18 or so who lived with his mother down the street. She was frequently away at work and he was a burn out always hanging around outside trying to impress us much younger kids who thought he was super cool. He taught us dirty jokes, let us look at his nudie magazines, try his beer and cigarettes and all the kids pretty much fought eachother over who he liked best. 

Well, one day I was riding my bike past his house and he called me over. I was excited because for a little while it had seemed like I was making lots of headway at being cool among the other kids because he had been taking an interest in me. He told me he had some new toy or something I was very interested in at the time, can't remember what now. He had just gotten it from his mom the other day and it was in his room.

 I don't remember what exactly set it off, as I was very eager to see this thing and have a chance at being his buddy, but I all the sudden felt suspicious. I asked if I could get my little brother as he would be interested too, but he said no. I asked if he could bring it outside, but no. His responses kept getting more hostile and aggressive, and in my mind I was panicking because while I felt a sense of foreboding, I was sure I was blowing my chances at acceptance.

 So, I brushed the feeling aside and stepped into the doorway. Something about the way the room was lit, the stale air, and his face just told my mind to get the fuck out, NOW. So I made an excuse and turned on my heel for the door. He began to try to talk me out of leaving and came rushing for the door. I didn't want to look like an idiot running away like a crybaby so I swallowed my urge to run and continued towards the door at a brisk pace but distinctly remember scrunching up my shoulders in anticipation of being grabbed. As I hurried out the door and lept off the porch, I can only describe the feeling as one you get when you feel you are being chased, where the hair on your neck is on end and you swear at any moment you'll feel their claws upon you. To this day, I don't know if I was just too fast, or he was too scared to actually grab me. I rode my bike straight home and never spoke to him again or went anywhere near his house.

The incident was strange indeed, and at the time I never understood exactly why I felt afraid or what I was in fact afraid of. This kid had always been decent to me, although the things he talked about or showed us were often inappropriate. But, those were the things we also thought were fascinating and cool. While I felt uneasy for a time, I quickly forgot about it and didn't consider it something to tell my parents about. In fact, they'd of likely gotten mad at me for going into his house in the first place and turned it into somehow being my own fault. Anyway, after a couple years we moved and I forgot about him entirely.

Now, the reason I remember this so well is because years later as adults, my younger sister confessed to me that he had molested her, she had never told anyone. She also said several other kids she knew in the area had been abused by him as well. I had forgotten all about the memory until she brought it up, but it was still there, crystal clear. The most chilling part was when she told me how he had also lured her inside his house while his mom was at work, by claiming he had something she liked inside. Apparently, she had gone far enough inside to his actual room, whereas I had only come into the living room, so by the time she realized something was wrong it was too late to escape. At first I couldn't even understand how she came in contact with him, since she is 5 years younger and had her own separate group of friends she played with but apparently one lived across the street from him, and was also a victim.

I originally made this comment on a question about when your instincts have played a crucial role in your life. My instincts my have saved me but not my sister, or many other kids that probably suffered. When she told me her story I had never felt so much regret and guilt in my life, nor wept so bitterly. If I had only said something things may have been so different for her and perhaps others. Please, if you ever find yourself in a situation where you feel threatened, leave immediately and REPORT the person. You are likely not the first person they've creeped nor the last, report it.

1353438890.0	13ituq	Meeting with a serial killer?	CoreMcClair	259	33	30	"Age: I was 20

Gender: female

Setting: a motorway in the south west/ west midlands of England, 1990

So I was what was known at the time as a 'crustie' though I read that they're called gutter punks in the US. I had dreadlocks, listened to anarcho-punk, and dressed in rags. I was a softie from the countryside by birth but a couple of years in the violent Nottingham squatter scene had hardened me up no end. I had left the squats and joined the new age travellers, and we were as aggressive a bunch of heavy drinking thieves as you'd be likely to meet anywhere in the uk at that time.  For this reason I was fearless; but youth and a safe upbringing made me stupid when I thought I was streetwise.

As was my habit, I'd taken myself off on my own and gone back to my hometown, now I was hitch hiking the breadth of the country to get back to the site where my friends were. 

I remember waiting for my next lift at a service station when this battered old 3 wheeled van pulled up. It was filthy and didn't look very pleasant but it was going in my direction so I was pleased. The driver seemed ok, a bit serious and intense I suppose but he said he could take me to the other side of Birmingham which was very convenient for me.

He was distinctive looking. This was the start of the 90s but he looked like my dad did during the 70s, and my dad was old fashioned his whole life. The man had thick black hair in a bit if a quiff, and sideburns, he was also v tanned like he worked outdoors a lot. He was lean, with dark eyebrows. I remember him so well because he looked like my dad and also my uncle. Maybe this was why I didn't feel less at ease with him.

So we start along the motorway and it all seemed fine. I was probably chatting like an idiot as usual and I remember glancing in the back of the van and seeing a heap of junk in there, bulky and dirty and some of it covered with a black cloth. He saw me looking at it and said it was equipment for a puppet show, which I found bizarre and incongruous. He didn't look like a children's entertainer, he was more childcatcher than friendly clown.

Along the road a bit and he started asking me how often I hitch and I let him know it's routine for me. He says 'but don't you get scared' so I say 'no, not really' but the guy won't leave it. 

'you must get scared'

'no I really don't'

'why don't you get scared?' 

'I can handle myself'

And so he goes on, and on, and on.  He insists I must be scared and asks me if I am scared now and how I know I would be able to handle being attacked and I'm getting really irritated. A bit freaked because it seems like he wants me to be scared and I'm giving the wrong answer, but mostly annoyed because the conversation is going in circles.  Eventually, when he asks why I reply:

'I don't get scared because I carry a knife' (this was true, but only a little lockknife for day to day purposes)

Well that stopped the line of questions, in fact it stopped the whole lift. The guy swerved into the hard shoulder at the side of the road and said 'I'll have to drop you off here'. 

Oh! I was surprised and a bit pissed off to be left here but I got out and grumbled to myself as he drove off. Cars aren't allowed to stop on the hard shoulder and people certainly aren't allowed to walk along it but what could I do? I stuck my thumb out and started to walk. 

About 15 minutes later a police car pulled up and told me off for being there but kindly gave me a lift across to the far side of Birmingham to a safe and legal hitching spot where I was picked up by a minibus full of pagan students who took me right to the traveller site. 

Years went by, I left the sites and the squats, had a baby, got a job and the only time I thought about this guy was when exchanging hitching stories with people. (This was my second favourite story behind the one about the Christian who drove at 100mph on the wrong side of the road because 'god will save me' whilst I screamed 'I'm an atheist, he won't save me!'  After I would tell that story, I'd mention the 'mad puppeteer' and his annoying questions.)

It wasn't until a couple of years ago that I realised the possible danger I had been in. I was watching a show called crimewatch on the bbc where they appeal for information and they had a special on the serial killer Peter Tobin, trying to track his movements through the years.  I follow serial killer stories with interest so I'd heard of him and had seen his picture as an old man. Then they showed pictures of him through the years and - holy shit - there he was, the 'mad puppeteer'.  The picture matched, the time matched.  Just how he looked in the late 80s, early 90s. Just how he looked when he murdered hitchhiker dinah mcnicol on 1991. 

I work for the criminal justice system so I have level headed colleagues (mostly!) and told people at work. They agreed I should ring the crimewatch number. If it was nothing it could do no harm, if it was something, it might really help.

I rang the crime watch number and said 'it's probably nothing but...'

A few days later they rang back and arranged to take a statement. A police officer came to my house and wrote down everything.  A few days later a second officer came to my workplace to get more info and to photocopy a diary i kept back then (frustratingly i said nothing about this lift in the diary! That's how little i thought i was in danger).  The crimewatch website updated to mention the three wheeled van and now is reported in some biographies as fact.

People ask me now if I truly believe that was Peter Tobin who gave me that lift.  I can never be sure. But i think in my mind I'm 75% sure I survived a serial killer. At the very least, I now realise who stupid and naive I was feeling so tough and so fearless. Sometimes when I think of what could have happened I just feel cold and sick. Because of my job I realise how many rapists and psychopaths there are out there and I am just relieved it wasn't my parents searching for answers about one of his victims.

TL,DR: silly me aged 20 gets a weird lift hitching and discovers 20 years later that I might have had a very lucky escape from Peter Tobin. "	t5_2t3t8	True

Unable to have children me and my husband adopted a small Yorkie named Daisy. She was practically a child to us. We spent just as much money on her as we would have on a child. She always got new clothes, we took her on trips, that sort of thing. Anyone who knows me knows that Daisy is my world.

Now when we rented our house it didn't have a fenced in backyard so it was difficult having to leash her every time she needed to go out to potty. She has a tiny bladder and needs to go almost every house. Not wanting to do major work on a house we were just renting we put up a small fence around a small area that also allows her to go up on the deck. The fence is only about thigh high and it's just a mesh fence. 

One morning I had let Daisy out, I've never had to keep a super close eye on her, 9/10 she'd go to the bathroom and come straight back in. I left the door open and sat on the bed and started folding some laundry. After a minute or two I heard a yelp. I jumped up and ran outside. I saw a hooded person *running* off with my dog. They jumped in a car that was parked on the road and sped off. I immediately called 911. Surprisingly I didn't assume it was Courtney. My dog is a purebred Yorkie. She is spayed, micro-chipped, AKC registered, etc. She is a very expensive dog and lots of people knew I had her. The police took a report but again told me there wasn't much they could do since it was a dog. If you haven't noticed the police around here are shitheads and refuse to do anything that isn't black and white. They don't do grey areas. I spent the rest of day bawling my eyes out, I'd called my husband and he told me to calm down. Over the next week we plastered flyers everywhere. A week and half goes by and I am more than distraught when I receive a text from Courtney.

""I found your dog!""

I knew at this point she had to have been the one who kidnapped my dog. There was no way it was just a coincidence she found my dog. I texted her back, I had no choice. I wanted nothing than to just get my dog back, any issues with her were in the far corners of my mind.

""Where?! Can you bring her to me now?""

""Yes, where do you want to meet?""

Luckily at this point my common sense kicked in so I chose a very public place to meet. We meet and she actually has Daisy. She hands her over, I wasn't about to thank this chick for kidnapping my dog so she could look like a hero. I didn't have any proof but I am 99% sure she kidnapped Daisy. I went to leave. Courtney was obviously pissed.

""No thank you? I found your fucking dog and you can't even THANK ME?! I made you who you are and I rescued your ""child"" and you can't even thank me. You're a fucking bitch. I hope you rot in hell and I hope it's at my hands.""

""Look Courtney, you have mental problems. I think you need help. I'm leaving.""

I left. I never let Daisy outside again without keeping a very close eye on her. The stalking however continued. She would sit outside my house and just stare. I'd call the police but she'd been gone when they got there. They still told me they couldn't do anything. I told them she had threatened me recently but again I was told I had no proof since it was verbal. Over the next month she continued to follow me everywhere I went. She'd text from blocked numbers. The usual shit she'd been doing.

One day I'd be out since early morning running errands and came home and my power was off. I was terrified but the rational part of me said that it was just the breaker. It wasn't. I called the power company and they told me that I had requested the power shut off earlier that week and they had sent someone out that morning. I promptly told them that it was not me. Unfortunately it was late and they couldn't send anyone out to turn it back on. I called my husband who was away on a job and told him. There was no way I could sleep alone with the power out and that crazy bitch lurking somewhere. I booked a hotel for the night and took my dog. That night at the hotel was a changing point. Why the hell was I living my life like this? I was afraid to let my dog out by herself, I looked over my shoulder everywhere I went. I'd stopped going out with friends because I didn't want to drag them into this. The police were useless at this point. I just wanted everything to stop. I returned home the next morning after the power company told me the power was on. My heart sunk. She'd broken into my house. Several pictures were broken. My clothes were rifled through. There was food all around my kitchen. And my house was generally a mess. She'd taken my wedding photos I had on the wall. Again I called the police. I told them about my power being shut off, about all the other reports I'd made and they agreed it was likely her and they'd investigate. A few days later I got a call. Courtney had admitted to breaking into my house, but nothing else. She was charged and got 30 days in jail. They charged her with a misdemeanor instead of a felony because she was a first timer. I was pissed. 30 days for the torture she put me through? Even still I had hoped it was a wake up call for her and she'd stop. 30 peaceful days come and go. I had really hoped she'd stop. But that wasn't going to happen.

She came to my house the day she was released. She just drove by ever so slowly. At this point I knew it wasn't going to stop until I took a stand. My husband was off that entire week so we decided to go buy a gun. I've always been against having a gun or one in the house so for me to ask my husband to purchase one was very out of character for me but I was fed up. I was tired of feeling helpless and defenseless. It took me a month and half to get a concealed weapon permit and a gun. And during this time she'd still been stalking me relentlessly. The day I got my gun was the day I decided to take a stand. The next day she drove to her usual stalking spot and just stared. Today I was prepared. I unloaded my gun. I wasn't going to shoot this girl. That wasn't my plan I just wanted her to know I was fed up. I walked outside and stood directly in view of her with my gun at my side. I yelled at her that I wasn't going to take it anymore. And it was going to stop. She sped off. I stopped seeing her everywhere, the texts slowly stopped coming, she would still drive by my house but it was less often and every time she did I'd stand in my yard with my gun at my side. A month after the incident it completely stopped. It's been a year since then. I haven't seen or heard from her since then. My friends haven't seen her and rumor has it that she moved back to whatever state her parents lived in. I really hope so.

To this day I am wary around every new person I meet ""Is this going to be the new Courtney?"". I still look over my shoulder waiting on her to come back.

She threatened me only once but towards the end I definitely was scared of her. She'd escalated and I was sure she was going to escalate further. It was terrifying experience for me, my husband and everyone involved. I don't know what made her snap. What made her go from a best friend to a psychopath intent on destroying my life. I wish I knew.

What I did is controversial and not suitable for everyone. If anything getting a gun and doing what I did shouldn't be done. You should try every other method to ending the solution before it comes to that. I got a gun because I no longer knew what to do. The police wouldn't help and I felt more threatened every day. I know she is capable of further harm.

If anyone has any questions feel free to ask me. I'll answer everything I can. 

Thank you for taking the time to listen to my story. It's not one I have expressed to many people and putting it out there has been awesome for me. "	t5_2t3t8	True

It was pretty late ( I drive around when I can't sleep) so there wasn't really anyone else around. I was driving through the business district of town when I notice there is a car behind me. No big deal right? Wrong. I started to get really uncomfortable because every time I make a turn they make the same turn, I realize they are following me. I try to rationalize it, I try to tell myself it is someone I know who is messing with me. After about 15 minutes of this I decide I can't go home regardless of who it is. So I drive to a popular all night Mexican restaurant and just park in front. I don't get out. I make sure my doors are locked. I have my phone in hand. They have parked about 5 spaces away lights on and engine running. I sit there for about 5 minutes waiting for them to make a move and suddenly they just drive away. I didn't recognize the car but I can see there are two large males in it as they drive away. After that I wait for about a minute before I take the long way home. 	t5_2t3t8	True

We were to spend a day in Baton Rouge then go visit my aunt who was the director of nursing at a Leprosarium in Carville (It's a museum now). [link, if you're interested. I spent a summer there.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hansen's_Disease_Museum)

In Baton Rouge my grandmother wanted to take a paddle wheel boat ride (I wanted to feed bread to alligators). My grandmother got her way. Let me tell you, even at that age, I knew the river was disgusting. It smelled horrible and all we did was weave in and out between huge oil tankers. 

Then ""he"" showed up. It's easy for me to describe exactly what he looked like, Richard Klein from Three's Company, [hairy chest and all.](http://i.imgur.com/vve0mWR)

He'd made eye contact with me as my grandmother and I boarded. The boat was very confusing, all these stairs that seemed to end on different levels. My grandmother took off for the bathroom, and there he was. Just like the image of Richard Klein, his shirt was unbuttoned almost to his navel. He leaned against the railing, pulled the right side of his shirt open and played with is nipple then struck a few [80's porn poses. SFW?](http://i.imgur.com/IepLBLx)

He didn't follow behind me, instead he headed me off at every pass. I swear, he must have been jumping railings. I finally found my grandmother at the buffet. I thought I had found safety, but he cared less about my grandmother. What was she going to do? He cut into the buffet line, right behind me. He started to whisper to me, but I was so frightened, it sounded like he was talking to me in a tunnel. I didn't make out full sentences, I just heard Young, Sexy, Yummy, but I never turned around. 

I jumped out of line and took off. For some reason, I was GOING to find the captain. He was right behind me this time. I ran to the bow of the boat and there was all this seating that wrapped around and was built into the bow. There were also a few tables stacked with empty bottles of beer. And sitting on those benches was a group of rugby or soccer players. They were wearing gold and green. For some reason, I had no problem diving, I mean I dove, right between them and grabbed onto one of them. I sat there shaking. I looked up and my stalker had the balls to try and stare me down. The men were all talking some language I didn't understand. One of them put his arm around me and another patted my head. The one across from me leaned in close, saw that I was frighted and followed my gaze. So I pointed and broke down bawling. The freaks face grew gray and frightened. Three of the men stood up and started walking towards him. They followed him and I don't know where they went or what they did.

1374890587.0	1j4yo7	When an intruder is in your house and the police takes 40 minutes to com	Caravage	267	38	32	"When i was 17, during summer, i was waiting for a friend to come to my house while my family was out of the country.  We planned on playing videogames all night long. I live in a small city of 7K people in France near Paris and the houses are far away from each other. I also live in front of a small park that gets very dark and scary at night. Just to let you know that there is no one around if you are in trouble. 

Around 11PM, my friend called me on my phone and told me ""can you open your door now because someone is following me"". We don't usually have any problem of violence in our neighborhood but some young kids sometimes try to steal your shit when you're alone in the street. So i ran downstairs to open the door, and i look at outside to see my friend getting in my driveway and closing the gate behind him. I open the door, he goes in and tells me that someone was following him and telling him ""you're dead, i'm going to kill you son of a bitch"". I watched outside again for 10, 20, 30 seconds but nothing happened. Suddenly, when the motion light turned off, i saw that huge guy, the fat and tall kind of guy running in my driveway and closing the gate behind him too, like if he knew what he was doing. I looked at the house door just waiting for the guy to try to open it. 2 seconds later, the guy just hit the door with his body as hard as he could and started to yell ""you're dead fucker, i'm going to kill you"". 

He kept on slamming against the door again and again. We ran upstairs and locked 2 doors behind us before locking ourselves in my room where i called the cops. I tell the policeman what was happening. The cop could even hear the guy destroying my door on the phone so i told them to hurry the fuck up. My friend and I were totally scared because we didnt know the guy at all, still we managed to find metal sticks to defend ourselves. The thing is, if the guy was able to destroy my front door, the other doors in my house would take 1 blow each. For 5 minutes, the stranger kept on hitting my door and then total silence. I cannot see the front door from my room and i was even too scared to look outside. The only thing i could see were the motion lights turning off and on all around the house for another 10 minutes. After that, everything was silent and dark but i was sure the guy was still there cause there is only one way out of my property. I immediatly thought that he managed to get in the house by breaking a window at the back of my house. 

The police took around FORTY minutes to arrive at my house, forty minutes of total terror. We were so relieve when we saw the  blue lights stopping in front of my driveway. And yet the creepier thing was to come. There were 5 armed policemen with bulletproof vest and everything. I yelled from my window ""i dont know where the guy is anymore, he might be in the house please do something"". 3 of them went to check the backyard while the other two were investigating the front door. 5 minutes later, the three guys actually opened my front door from the inside and told us to stay locked cause there was a broken window and the guy was maybe in. It took them another 10 minutes to find the guy, who was hiding in the bathroom upstairs in the god damn closet like in the movies. They arrested him after a brief fight. The guy was actually drunk as hell and had no idea where he was or what he was doing here, and told them he was just hiding there because he was scared. 

I didn't sleep for a week.


TL:DR : A huge guy followed a friend to my house and started to hit the door. He broke a window and hid in a closet, where the cops found him, 40 minutes after i called them. 




EDIT : some of you suggested that they would have been to scared to make a move. I don't know how to explain what occured in my mind but when we were waiting for the cops, i got into a ""killer mode"", staring at the door and absolutely ready to jump on the guy if he came to us. I was overwhelmed by the adrenaline and actually scared to think how it would have ended for him if we decided to hit him as hard as we could with those thick metal sticks. But, not knowing that he was just a drunk guy but a potential murderer, i was ready to kill the guy with my hands to protect my life and my friend. That was a terrible but unique experience to live. Maybe i'm a Berserker ;) In short, when you are in danger, i think your body and instinct take control and turn into a killing machine. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1339166856.0	urmj7	"""If you died tonight, do you think you'd see God?"""	kyroko	267	42	30	"Long time reader, first time poster.

This happened to me several years back.  I was living with a friend at the time and was en route back to my apartment from a night with my family.  I was kind of in a foul mood and was out of cigarettes, so I stopped at a gas station on my way back home.

This gas station was dingy.  I mean, just absolutely run down.  The sad thing is that it was built that way -- it was built to be barely functional.  The lights outside didn't always work and the place always smelled of burnt rubber.  It was kinda sketchy during the day, but at 10:00 at night it took on a whole different air.  However, I was seriously in need of cigarettes, so I stopped.

I got out of my car, went inside, grabbed a bottle of Gatorade, and made my way to the counter, only to notice that there was no one standing there.  I'd stopped by this gas station before and had the same thing happen, figuring they were either in the bathroom or at their house (the employees were all part of a family who lived on the premises) so I hung around for a few minutes.  Soon enough, the door to the restroom flew open and out lumbered a rather angry looking female.  She rang me up for the Gatorade, gave me attitude when I said I wanted cigarettes (which I totally didn't understand, like, you never get business, sell when someone wants something!), and I was on my way.  Total time that had elapsed from when I got out of my car to walking out of the door was maybe five minutes.

I walk over to my car and notice the one overhanging light that had been on when I got out of my car was now off.  Not thinking much of it, I went to open my door and noticed that the car was unlocked, which I almost never leave it unlocked... but then again, I figured I was kind of in a hurry so it was possible.  I got in, started my car, lit a cigarette, and kind of blindly backed out while opening my gatorade.  I recapped the bottle, put it in the seat next to me, and was about to pull out onto the road when a hand reached out from the back seat.

Panicked, my immediate thought was to turn around, but as I started to, the man said, ""Don't fucking turn around if you know what's good for you.""  I sat facing forward and asked him what he wanted.  He said he wanted a ride somewhere.  My phone was in my booksack on the floor of my passenger seat, too far to grab discretely.  I asked him where he wanted to go.  He gave me directions to a well known crack alley about four miles from where we were.

I'd been to the area before.  I used to deliver pizza in that part of town before switching to a (relatively) safer delivery area, so finding it was no trouble.  As I drove, I kept trying to sneak glances at him in my rearview mirror, but it seemed like every time I did his face was encompassed by shadows.  We got to the place he wanted to go and he rolled the window down, yelling out some guy's name.  That guy came over to my car and sold this intruder some drugs through my back window, the whole time talking about ""that scared honky in the front seat.""  After about 15 minutes, they were done.

Once the dealer walked away, the man in the back seat told me to bring him back to the gas station where he had gotten into my car.  Now, the stretch of road to get back there is not well lit or well travelled after dark, but I went anyway.  I just wanted him to get out of my car.

As we drove back, he started trying to talk me up, which I thought was weird.  I gave reasonable answers without revealing anything personal about myself.  We were about halfway through our trip when he asked me to pull over on the side of the road.  This stretch of road went over one of those man-made concrete ditches, which meant that there was a significant paved shoulder over that ditch.  He had me pull over there and turn off the car.

""Do you believe in God?""

My heart started racing.  ""I'm not sure.""

""If you died tonight, do you think you'd see God?""

""I don't know.  I'd like to think so.""

""Close your eyes.  Put your hands on the steering wheel, push your head forward and let it rest on the steering wheel.""

Trembling, I did as he commanded.

""Now count.""

""What?""

""Are you fucking deaf?  I said count.""

So I did.  I started counting, slowly counting.  My pace matched the seconds ticking by.  I wondered how many more I'd have.

I could tell he was shifting in the back seat.  I figured this was it.

Then he simply got out of the car and ran off.

I kept counting.  I counted to at least a thousand before I felt it might be okay to look up.  I didn't want to look up to him standing in front of my car waiting for me to disobey.  When I did look up, though, he wasn't there.

I sped off toward my apartment, grabbed my phone, and called the cops.  Naturally, they said there was nothing they could do -- I didn't have a description of the guy, other than he was a male.  I thought he might be black, because I think that was the color of the skin I saw when I initially started to turn around, but it was so fleeting that I couldn't be certain.  He didn't take anything out of my car or leave anything.

I learned a few things that day.  One, I never, ever, EVER leave my car unlocked.  Two, I always check my car before I get into it.  Three, I'm never stopping at that gas station again (I no longer live there, so that helps).  Four, if someone still somehow manages to get into my car to try something like that again, I'm running full speed into the nearest light post.  I'll be wearing a seat belt, while there's virtually no chance they will be."	t5_2t3t8	True
1349618728.0	1135db	"The ""I have candy here in my car"" goes wrong"	Skangryph	261	37	28	"I was much younger when it happened, I was in primary school (I'm an Aussie, primary school is year 1-6 in case you don't know what I'm talking about) I was around 10 at the time and because my house has less than 2 blocks from the school I usually walked there and home.

Usually uneventful I came to the end of my street that afternoon after school, There was a house on the corner that had a rather large grass strip on the side that entered into my home street and there was a pickup truck parked on it, It was strange because I knew the old lady who owned the house (she was awesome, gave the kids icypoles and we used to catch lizards in her backyard), None of her relatives as far as I knew or family for that fact owned a pickup truck.

I was passing the truck when the door opened and a man in his 30's leaned out:

""Hey little girl, um, you parents told me one of them is in hospital and they wanted me to pick you up and take you there""

Me: It took me a minute to process this, as I was looking for lizards at the time, Also I can see my house from the end of the street, both cars are in the driveway at home meaning Mom and Dad are currently at home, If something happened my young mind said that one of the cars might be missing, Or my Mum might have picked me up from school.

Me: ""Uh, Sorry, I don't really know you...My home is just down the road, I'm gonna go home""

I tried to disengage and leave but he actually drove his car partially in front of me as I walked forward to leave, I briefly considered going into the old ladies house but I could see her car was gone and she was not home at all, Trying to go into Old lady Thompson's house has a huge bluff and it was possible he knew it.

I asked him why he was trying pick my up to see my parents as I could see the cars in the driveway, I was so scared at this point, then came the worst part, He gestured to his dashboard, In which was an obviously half melted and gross lollipop covered in whatever debris was on his dash in an attempt to get me into the car as a last ditch.

""Oh, your Mum and dad left the cars, they...gave me this lollipop ,  you want this lollipop?, Get in the car and I will give it too you and we can go see your parents""

I Pretty much panicked at that point and RAN all the way home, His car trailing me slowly till I went inside my house and told my Dad.

It may be a bit of a creepy ending but less than two weeks after that incident was riding my bike down the street when I saw the exact same pick-up cruising down the street and it stopped when it saw me.

I saw it and freaked, I rode down the hill to my friends house and even through they were not home I rode up their driveway and pretended to knock on their door, At which the car drove away.

SO creepy, I cannot imagine what would have happened if I had got into that car.

The terrible afterward is that my cousins children currently live in the same area and walk to and from school as well, A few weeks ago some man tried to pick up my cousins young daughter and son using the same

 ""Yours parents are hurt, They want me to take you to the hospital"" 

line, Thankfully My cousins daughter is smart and aware of stranger danger and ran quickly to a neighbours house where they called the police.

1371443479.0	1ghv1o	"""Saved your life"""	gnarlymarlee	269	46	25	"I wasn't quite sure if this fit in here, but the more stories I read the more I remembered about the situation, so uh, here goes? I was in the seventh grade at the time, so about 12 or 13? And my cousin would have been 14 or 15, both of us girls.

I was at my first ""real"" concert, it was Deep Purple (my aunt had gotten the tickets for free, I had no idea who they were, but it seemed fun). Old men had started to become interested in me the year before, and it really freaked me out. They would stare at me in the grocery store while I was with my mom and this was before I had gotten the balls to start death glaring adults. 

Anyway, my cousin and I were incredibly bored, since this really wasn't our type of music and none of the band members were wearing eyeliner, so we started to walk around. It was an outdoors venue, and we had lawn seats, so we walked around the hill, people watching and talking. We stopped just outside the crowd to sit on this railing that was maybe three feet high from the ground, but there was a rather large ditch behind it, putting us six or so feet up from that side. I was facing my cousin and all of a sudden somebody grabs me from behind, tips me over, and then pulls me back up, yelling, ""Saved your life!"" 

He was a typically creepy guy. I know a lot of creeps dress normally, but he was really creepy. He was in blue jean cut offs and a dirty shirt, middle aged, his hair was scraggly and curly, he was missing some teeth, and he reeked of alcohol, clearly incredibly drunk. I froze up, but my cousin, who had always been a bad ass, hopped off the railing and freaked out on him, yelling at him about touching any girl, let alone such a young one, and how he needed to walk the fuck away right then or she would beat the living shit out of him. 

The guy was so drunk that he started off laughing, telling her that it was just a joke and that no one was upset except her. He even asked me if I was scared. I had pissed myself and was like a deer in headlights, so I shook my head no, hoping I wouldn't upset him. My cousin could obviously tell I was terrified though, so she kept going, telling him to just leave. We tried walking away, but he followed us. 

Honestly, we should have just kept going and walked to the crowd, but he yelled something along the lines of, ""You're just jealous that your friend's cuter than you, that's why you cut yourself."" My cousin wasn't a cutter, but I was, and she knew that, and she freaked out. She was screaming about how I was only 12, that he shouldn't make fun of mentally ill people, and how pathetic he was. There was pretty much no way she was just going to walk away at that point. She was only 15 at the most, and she thought she was a lot tougher than she (to be specific, she was a juggalo), and was irrational. Both her and the guy just got more pissed.

I'm glad that they were so loud, because it attracted the attention of two guys who were smoking a little bit away, and they came over and started yelling at the guy, moving in between us and them. I remember one of the guys started pushing the creep, and the other turned around and told my cousin to go back to our friends, but she was so enraged I don't think she even noticed. My most vivid memory of the entire situation is this guy, mid-twenties, just trying to enjoy a concert, looking me straight in my terrified twelve-year-old eyes and saying in the nicest voice in the middle of all of this chaos, ""I know you're scared, but take your friend and go, there's no way we'll let this guy follow you. I'm sorry,"" and then standing next to his friend to form a barricade. 

I still wish I could thank those guys, because I have no idea what would have happened if they hadn't stepped in."	t5_2t3t8	True
1331118099.0	qllli	{MY} The quiet boy in my Senior English class had a lot different plans for his life than anyone expected.	klunkie	255	32	63	"I have been reading these for a few days and decided since I was awake in the middle of the night I will tell you guys about the boy in my English class. 

I went into class the first day of school and there was this new guy that I had never seen before, He looked like any normal guy, just seemed a little shy. I was just a regular student, not super smart, super athletic, or super popular. Just a regular student trying to finish school and go on with my life.


My teacher did a seating chart on the first day of class and I ended up sitting right next to this new kid. We didn't talk much other than ""hey, Whats up?"" I learned his name was John and after a few weeks we got to talking a little more. I never saw him outside of class and we never got very chummy but it was always civil. After a few months I got some pretty bad senioritis and just stopped caring, my teacher because the worst teacher I had ever had in all of my schooling, she would start belittling me in class and say terrible things. John ALWAYS stood up for me every time our teacher went on her tangents. I started skipping class and what not like normal high school kids do. Until one day I had a death in my family, I was out of school for about a week and a half. My mother had told our school administrator about the situation but I'm guessing the memo wasn't passed onto my English teacher. When I got back to school It was my first class of the day. My teacher TORE ME A NEW ONE, she was screaming at me and calling me lazy and how i would never amount to nothing. I ran out of the room crying and called her a bitch. While I was gone John tore into her  standing up for me again and he told her why I was gone. I don't know exactly what was said or done while I was gone because i refused to go back into class that day. The next day after everything cooled down I thanked John and I had a lot of respect for him. It meant a lot to me that someone would stand up for me. 

The rest of the year goes on like normal, we all graduate and I never see John again, but I had always remembered what he did for me in class that day. I go on with my life and start college, then one day I turn on the news and hear about how this guy was murdered in my area of town, a few days later the news is talking about another murder. They found the guy and when they showed his picture, I was in total disbelief, It was John. He went on a murderous rampage and killed 2 guys and shot and wounded another. 

Here is a link to one of the news articles about him. It is still crazy for me to think that this kid who stood up for me and defended me is now facing 2 life sentences in prison.

I knew exactly what this entailed. I was to walk the five blocks to his old residence; a mutual friend's house, where he lived in a loft in the garage, slip in unnoticed by the neighbors, search until I found it, leave the money, and be on my merry way. simple right?
Nope, wrong.
The walk started off sketchy enough, with the lone street light on the block going out as I left, plunging me into this unnatural pseudo-darkness. I walked along in silence, the only sound coming from the highway some distance away. I'd walked this walk before, even at this hour, but I couldn't shake this anticipation in my gut.
I reached the house, which I must say is absolutely terrifying at night. Something didn't seem right. My friend is very strict with his bedtimes. This meant that the house was dark at exactly 10 pm each night.
Tonight though, there was a glow coming from the first floor.
This could have been a number of things. Maybe he had other friends over? brought a girl home? getting a late night snack? I quickly reassured myself as I stepped through the door into the pitch black garage.
I closed the door behind me and got to searching. The garage is separated into an upstairs and a downstairs to save space. Upstairs, there is a washer and dryer, while downstairs was box storage that led under the stairs, forming a cave like lair. Not going to lie, It felt like a robbery simulator, rummaging through my friend's garage unannounced, looking for drugs. My heart began to race at the thought.
It really started racing though, when I heard the heavy footprints stomping their way toward the inside garage entrance. I had kicked a paint can on accident, so they probably heard it.
Now, my first instinct told me that I should make myself known. It was my friend's place after all? He probably even knew about the whole deal. We'd laugh, he'd point out where it was, and I'd be on my merry way.
That's when I realized something...
My friend is does not own a single pair of boots...
In a split instant, I had ducked down under the floorboards behind some boxes. The door outside was quite far away, the footstep quickly approaching, so escape was not an option. I had to hide it out...
I was so confused...
I felt like I was in a slasher movie, hand over my mouth to keep from hyperventilating and everything. I listened as the door slammed open, the footsteps creaking slowly along the floorboards just inches to my right. They paced around the garage for what seemed like ages, grunting and taking heavy, labored breaths. They stopped at the top of the stairs, never making their way down though. Soon enough, they made their way back into the house, slamming the door behind them.
As soon as the door clicked, I bolted, and I didn't stop running until I was back home, tucked away in my bed, every single light in the house on for the rest of the night.
I wasn't about to get the cops involved with the situation, less they go searching and get my friend in trouble, so I simply sent him a text message and went to sleep.
I awoke to two texts in the morning. The first was a message from my dealer friend asking me if I was alright. The second was a text from the friend who owned the house, telling me he got stuck at a friends house overnight.
I was so fucking confused...
Later that day, the friend with the house sent me a news link over facebook with no caption. It was a news report about a burglary/murder that took place on my friend's street. Two houses had already been confirmed as being broken into in the middle of the night. The first was the home of injured veteran. He was found in the bedroom, a 9mm slug lodged into his head, all the valuables in the house gone.
The second house was my friend's..."	t5_2t3t8	True
1375951096.0	1jy14q	Lost in Alexandria	shamr0ck_	270	48	28	"Hey Reddit,
I'm a male living in Johannesburg, South Africa. Also noted as one of the crime hot spots of the world. Getting robbed is just kind of something everyone is prepared for, emotionally at least. Guns aren't nearly as common as they are in America, and I often think they should be.

I've never had much of a hard time in South Africa, and while I know a lot of people who have been severely affected by Johannesburg crime, I've always just been pretty lucky; nothing's ever happened other than attempts or close calls. That is, of course, until one night where I happened to be lost.

South Africa is full of townships. They're basically settlements for anyone living at a level of poverty so appalling it makes the American ""sponsor an African"" videos look like ""sponsor a Kardashian"". I'm not even kidding. Here are some pictures for context.

[Alexandria, the place in question](http://www.friendsofalex.org.za/images/alex.jpg)

[This gives a good idea of townships in general](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2011/2/21/1298289285649/Khayelitsha-Township-in-C-007.jpg)

[And one last one](http://aestheticsofadailylife.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/townships-1.jpg)


One of these townships, Alexandria, happens to be quite near a nice neighborhood where rich people stay -- big plots, big houses, etc., and a good friend of mine lives there. When I was 18, just having gotten my license, I decided I'd pop through to his house after going to a party with a few others. I didn't really know the way all too well if I wasn't leaving from my house, but I knew the basic idea was that if I didn't go on the freeway I'd have to go through Alexandria. And being an idiot I figured that'd be just fine. I knew the area was dangerous as hell but getting lost didn't cross my mind.

And so I arrive. It's dark as hell. There aren't any street lights, just some fires that people have started on the side of the road, and I'm already feeling scared as shit. It's pretty damn quiet and it was late for me to be driving through -- about 11PM. I kept going straight on the main road, hoping it'd take me to where I was going, but as time wore on I noticed Linboro Park (the area I was talking about earlier) fading away, so I pulled a few funky turns. Taking a left, I catch something in my headlights that scares me shitless.

This dude who looks like a hobo -- beanie, rags -- is carrying a full on fucking deer across the street. It's dead and looks like it's rotting. Unsettling as fuck. I brake to let him cross and then slowly stroll past and keep an eye on him. As soon as he reaches the other side he pulls out a hatchet and starts hacking the deer up. Needless to say I'm terrified, but I don't read into it too much. Poor people will eat whatever they can and I was pretty sure he was just going to eat whatever meat he could get off the deer.

Keep driving and start heading down the way I came and I'm starting to regret coming here. Still no street lights, hardly any cars passing, just guys on the sides of the road with fires lit, and they all eyed me out. I probably should've mentioned this earlier for context:

White people do not go to Alexandria. That's not me being racist, it's merely fact. The white people who are in poverty in South Africa live like American trailer trash, whereas the truly poverished black South Africans settle in these townships, and it's just not normal to see a white person there. Furthermore, my car was a black BMW 325Ci, which is a pretty awesome car amongst the South African community and I'd had a lot of people warning me that I'd be specifically targeted for hijacking or whatever, but I always shrugged it off because I never had any reason to care. My car also had a tendency to overheat. 

Back to topic. I drive past a group of guys all sitting around a fire in a trash can and as I drive past they turn to look at me. I'm taking it pretty slow. Two blocks down I'm in a dead street and my car's heat gauge heads over into the red. The only word going through my head is ""fuck, fuck, fuck"" and I pull over and kill the engine and lights. It's pitch black but I can make out a few flickering lights, be it from fires or electricity in my rearview. It didn't look like anyone was around so I felt okay, but I knew I'd have to wait a good 20 minutes before starting my car up again.

I went outside and started checking the engine and fumbled my phone about to get some light. I started doing random shit to try and handle the heat problem like open the bleeder. My phone had about 30% battery still but it cut out for no damn reason while I was using the flashlight on it. So no phone. No car. In Alexandria. 

Then I hear something which makes me shit myself. Not like a sudden ""AH!"" fright, but my heart just sank and I felt like puking. I look down the road and can barely make him out, but there's a black dude walking towards me and he's dragging a pole along the street, so I hear that clanking sound while it rubs against the tar. Now that's a pretty obvious sign that he's not just gonna stop to say hello, and I'm shitting myself. On the bright side I have had a lot of weird/violent confrontations and ""almost getting mugged"" so I'd handled it before...it's just that this time I was in the middle of nowhere and I was basically a fucking pariah.

So I stand there. Stupidly. And then I figure my only option is to make a friend. So as he gets close, dragging his pole along, I decide to act my ass off. I quickly noticed that running would do me no good. I'd probably just get murdered somewhere if I did, and then I'd have no car. And if I stayed I risked both, but fuck it. I put on a big smile, put my hand out for a handshake and say ""Hey what's up buddy! How's it going? Don't worry about the car, just a little bit of a heat problem.""

He looks a little confused and kind of pissed off and I'm almost certain he's just gonna whack the shit out of me with the pole, but I seriously feel like there's nothing else I can do. If I leave my car I'll probably die in fucking Alexandria. I may as well stay put. So I pull out my cigarettes and offer him one, which was the first time I was really, really glad to be a smoker, and I ask him for his name. He kind of grunts ""Xlepo"" or one of those weird clicking names as he grabs a cigarette, and when I light it for him I see his eyes are bloodshot as hell and overall he just looks like a man in...not good health. 

I take a look at his pole and ask him about it. Y'know, like ""Why the fuck do you have a pole?"" only I word it better. He grumbles a little bit but I make out ""Ai, it's dangerous out here. The robbers and rapists and what what."" I figure I need a good deal of bullshit, because I just get a terrible fucking vibe from being here, and from this gentleman now leaning against my car. ""Oh well you can feel safe here,"" I say, and I try and put some...I don't really know how to say this...I try to make it sound scary. Which I can do pretty well, my voice is pretty commanding. But at this point I actually want to scare him enough that he'll back off. 

I think it worked, 'cause he looks at me and his eyes are kind of shifty and he says ""Why?""
And I smile and say ""I've got a gun on me"" and I lift my shirt up a bit at the back where he can't see it.
On the inside I have a mix of emotion. Half of me is high fiving the shit out of me because I think it's actually working, and then the other half is expecting him to call my bullshit, take it as a threat, or just get pissed off. But he looks at me and I can tell he's a little freaked out, and he starts making small talk while we finish our cigarettes. He asks what I'm doing in Alex. Fair question. I tell him I got lost and leave it at that. I feel a little bit calmer now. He kills his cigarette and I really want to check my car now, but I'm not stupid enough to turn my back and look at my engine while he stands there.

I shake his hand and say, ""Alright, thanks for the company, but it's not safe here. I think you should go."" It was such an act on my part that I can't believe I pulled it off. But he says okay and walks away, pole in hand, and when I see he's gone I turn back to my car and take the biggest fucking sigh of relief ever.

Now, fortunately, the heat was back to normal. Unfortunately, my story doesn't stop there, but I'm not writing a book and I'm over 1500 words in, so I'll leave it at that for now.

1367952191.0	1dvlsd	Keep quiet, the children are sleeping.	pyroannie	264	41	36	"Now, this is a strange encounter of mine that's always stuck with me, I'll try to recall it the best that I can.  

It was 12 years ago and my boyfriend at the time had just finished playing a show.  My girl friend and I were waiting outside in the parking lot for him so we could leave.  He came walking up to us with his friend and another dude that he had just met.  The new guy said he was throwing a party at his house and invited us to come, that he had a ton of booze and his parents were out of town so it was fairly easy to convince us.  We all jumped in the car and began following him.   

The drive out took a really long time, this was in rural Indiana and we were far out in the boonies.  Since I grew up in the region, I knew most of the back roads, it seemed like he was taking us in circles and making odd, frequent turns through neighborhoods.  It was obvious that he didn't want us to remember how to get there, fair enough.  But we were worried that we weren't going to remember our way home.

We ended up turning onto a long stretch of dirt road and eventually pull up to this huge mansion in the middle of nowhere.  It was pitch dark out and there were no lights lit on the property, but it was surrounded by fields with no neighbors to be seen.  We got out of our cars and asked him why nobody else was there, and he said that more people would be coming soon, but it was already the early morning so that didn't seem right.  He wanted to show us around the property a bit, he took us back to what looked like large barn that they have on fairgrounds.  He opened the side door and we walked in.  I remember there being a long row of empty stalls for horses and in the center there was what looked like an indoor horse arena.  It was pretty cool but there was barely any lighting so it was very spooky at the same time.  

He opens up the door to the house and lets us all in.  The house was massive inside with a beautiful double staircase, it was surreal, I had never seen a house that big in person.  It was dark inside as well, though he didn't want to turn the lights on for some reason.  So, aside from some dim light from a few night lamps, it was very hard to see.  He walked us through the house, but said that we had to keep it really quiet.  He pointed to a bedroom door and said he was watching his younger siblings while his parents were out of town and didn't want to wake them up.  He made us wait while he checked on them.  He went in the room, came out, and said that they were fine and still sleeping.  I remember thinking it was pretty shitty that he left them there alone, in the middle of nowhere, while he went to the show.

We then go down to the main level where there was a full stocked bar and get a small party going.  There was just about any type of liquor you could imagine and he said we could have as much as we wanted.  So, we were getting pretty wasted *fast.*  I recall the guy was very quiet and kept to himself the entire time.  He kept leaving often to go back upstairs to ""check on the kids,"" though said that we were more than welcome to ""use"" one of the downstairs basement rooms if we wanted to.  He went to check on the kids again and my girl friend and the other dude were busy getting to know one another, so me and my bf decided to explore the basement a bit.  

We found a room in the back that was empty except for a bed, so we closed and locked the door and started to get busy, too.  Not too long after, I heard something weird outside of the door and what sounded like heavy breathing, like somebody was listening to us.  We stopped and my bf called out, but nobody answered.  Then the doorknob started rattling like someone was trying to get in and they began pounding really hard on the door, almost like trying to break it down.  My bf yelled something and it stopped, but still, nobody answered.  He jumped up and opened the door, but nobody was there.  We quickly got ourselves together and went upstairs and to the room where our friends were.  I thought maybe they were just screwing with us, but they were still in the same exact spot doing their thing.  We asked them if they saw the dude and they said they hadn't.    

My bf and I walked upstairs to look for the guy and find out what was going on.  We saw that the door to the room where the ""kids were sleeping"" was open.  We looked in the room and it was completely empty.  No beds, no furniture, bare walls and no kids.  My stomach dropped, I was beyond freaked out at this point.  We ran downstairs and told our friends that we had to leave right away, that it was an emergency.  We got the hell out of there as fast as we could without looking back and fortunately didn't run into the guy on the way out. 

Still to this day, I have so many unanswered questions.  I think about it and wonder what that guy was planning.  If he was this Norman Bates type psycho or just a creep.  I'm just glad we didn't stick around long enough to find out.

1356774823.0	15mbh8	Hey kid, mind if I take a look?	Cupinacup	253	34	25	"As a 6'5"" 250 lb male, I don't really have any very interesting stories about being stalked as I'm not a very good target for such activities, but I do have one distinct memory of how something could have gone very wrong for me.

When I was younger I'd go to the supermarket with my parents but I'd just sit and read in the car with the window cracked open just a bit. I believe I was 12 at the time of this particular occurrence, but the memory of when is slightly hazy, I only have an extremely vivid recollection of the events that happened.

As I was reading, I was startled by a knock on the car window. I'm pretty jumpy so I must have looked scared to the middle-aged man standing outside the passenger side of the car. He didn't look like a creep but in retrospect that never stopped anybody from diddling little kids like me. So he says that he and his wife were thinking of getting the car that I'm sitting in (Honda Odyssey) and he asked if I could open the door so he could take a look around inside.

I'm not a very assertive person and I was even less so back then. I knew that you weren't supposed to talk to strangers or anything so the situation felt kind of weird but I couldn't help but feel like saying no was being rude. I mumbled and stalled and looked around and noticed a man sitting in his car about two spots down to the left of mine. He was sitting in his driver's seat and was watching the whole thing. We locked eyes (or I thought we did at least, he was wearing sunglasses so I couldn't see his eyes) and he slowly shook his head and clearly mouthed the word ""No"" to me.

I turned back to the guy at my window and said, ""sorry, no"" in the most apologetic voice I could. He smiled at me and said, ""that's alright, thanks anyway."" After he left I more or less blocked the instance from my memory except for occasionally when it resurfaces randomly. At the time I really just felt like I turned down an odd but not necessarily bad man, but looking back at it, nothing about that situation would have ended well if I had opened my door. Sometimes I wonder about what would have happened if that other person wasn't there.

tl;dr, guy bugs little 12 yo me to open the car door, other guy a few cars down signals me not to do it. I don't and my butt remains safe."	t5_2t3t8	True
1341948891.0	wcdhm	The follower in the state park.	Renegade2366	255	32	49	"There are actually a couple stories i'd like to share, but this is my first. 

When i was 18 i spent a lot of time in the Cohutta wilderness. My favorite spot was a set of waterfalls several miles from the nearest parking area. Most visitors just parked in the RV area and swam in the creek right along the gravel road, in the two years i hiked those trails i never saw anyone further in than a half mile into the trail.

Anyway, one saturday i took my girlfriend to see the waterfalls since she had never seen one in person before. We set off on the trail and not fifteen minutes into the walk she grabbed my arm and got quiet and said she felt like she was being watched and had the 'heebie jeebies'. 

I assured her everything was safe (the only thing id ever had to worry about in my part of the woods are the occasional bear or copperhead). We continued on but she could never shake the feeling of being watched, i just figured she wasnt used to wilderness and was having trouble adjusting.

A couple hours later we finally reach the end of the trail and had a picnic at the bottom of the falls.  After we finish eating she tried to check her cell phone for messages and started to panic when she realized we had no service. I explained to her that there was no cell reception anywhere around for miles, that we are finally alone and can enjoy the peace and solitude. Which of course made her panic.

We started heading back almost immediately because she was clearly scared and i couldn't help but smile thinking it was silly. On the way back i explained to her how many times id been out there all alone and never had any problems but she still couldnt shake the feeling of being watched. 

We were about a mile from the falls on the only trail around when we heard someone call from behind.  I jumped nearly out of my skin and turned to see a man walking toward us. He had a rifle slung over his shoulder and a heavy beard with his hat tipped low. She took a small step behind me.

""What can i do for ya?"" I asked, trying to sound friendly.
""You guys left your cell phone back by the falls."" He said, i saw a slight grin behind his beard as he looked at my girlfriend.
""Oh thanks for the assist."" I said extending my hand. He shook his head and told me he didn't bring it, and that it was still sitting up there, and maybe we should follow him back up there and get it ourselves.

We politely declined and made our way back down the trail as quickly as we could with him following us on the trail several feet behind. He followed us all the way back to our car and she showed me her cell phone when i opened her door.

I haven't been back to that particular trail since then.

TL;DR. We reached dead end of trail and made our way back, then creepy guy tried to lure us back deeper into the woods and followed us all the way back to the car.

1346961317.0	zgrqx	Pool boy stalker	polkadotpanties	296	72	18	"When I was 16-17 I worked as a life guard at a private pool in my neighborhood. You had to be a member and each member was assigned a member id. You could buy a friend or guest pass. During the summers on Friday night we had what was called ""Friday Night Cheers"" where we would have a band play, the adults would sit around the bar and drink, and all the kids would come and swim till about 10pm. One night I was working cheers I was at the diving well and there was a guy and his friend trying to splash me while going off the diving board. I didn't think anything of it because every kid tries to splash the lifeguard. 

As it was getting close to closing I started to go around and clean up all the tables. The diving board guy started to follow me around and make small talk. I'm a very friendly person so I started having a conversation with him. He tells me his name and that he is 19 and home from college. He then asks me for my number. I tell him no, I don't give out my number to strangers and that I have a boyfriend. (Not sure if I did at the time though). He won't stop asking, saying he just wants to be friends so I leave and go sit in the guard shack.

A couple days later I'm working and he's there again. We aren't suppose to talk to people while on duty but he won't go away so I start to ignore him. He stops talking but just kind of hangs out in the water right by me. A guy I work with comes to take my spot so I can go relieve another guard at another station. The guy follows but I ignore him. This continues everyday. 

One day I get a text from a number that I don't know. I ask who it is and its the guy from the pool. The only way I can think that he got my number is from our schedule that hangs in the guard shack right by the door which is always open. I tell him he needs to stop texting me and following me around. The texts stop but he continues to come to the pool everyday and follow me. I finally tell my manager and she says the next time he comes in they will make sure he really is a member; sometimes people will give their friends their member number if they know a picture isn't attached to it on the computer. So he comes in and they ask for an id. It doesn't match the information on the computer and his id says he is 27. I don't know why but they let him in anyway. He comes over to me and as soon as he gets five feet away my manager comes over and tells me to go take my break. I come back fifteen minutes later and she had kicked him out. Id never seen him since. I know its not as bad as other peoples experiences but it really pissed me off that he just would not leave me alone. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1376515880.0	1kdk3z	Hey get out of my pool!!!	TherealQBsacker5394	269	49	53	"  Sorry this is so long! Well I have plenty of stories from over the years and it takes a lot to scare me, but this one sufficiently freaked me out.  I am a big horror movie fan as well so I feel desensitized to freaky situations, except this one. 

  This happened about a year ago, I’m a male, big guy, ex-football player, I’m in my late 20’s, I live in a nice neighborhood in Arizona. Needless to say I don’t have much to fear at night.  I had 2 roommates living with me at the time so there always seemed to be someone home with me at night. I got home late from a business trip around midnight, came into the house, exhausted and dropped everything and went to bed. I am a heavy sleeper so it takes something loud to wake me. 

  Then around 3am I hear a loud “Ghetto Knocking” on my door, sounded like someone was kicking my door down. I had never heard anything like it before.  Though it was a Saturday so I figured my roommates had gone out to the bars and forgot their keys. Begrudgingly stumble out of bed, walking down the hallway in the dark and noticed all the bedroom doors are open and no roommates to be found. Ah, it must be them, they are messing with me. I arrive at my front door and look through the peep hole and see a young woman, homeless looking but actually kind of cute. She had a really baggy sweatshirt on with jeans and a beanie. 

  Might I remind you this is Arizona in the dead of summer, it’s had to be 95 degrees at this time, this was odd. She was frantic, almost like she was being chased, so I was just going to open the door and make sure she was ok but then she started laughing, like a scary laugh. Which this stopped me in my tracks then she proceeded to yell “I need to pee let me in!” Over and over for a good 5 minutes. I just stood behind the door in silence watching this through the peephole, I wasn’t scared at this moment, I was annoyed about to yell at her to get out of here, then all of a sudden she just turns and hopscotched down my driveway like a child. Just thought to myself this girl is wacked out on drugs or something.

  I go back to bed. 30 minutes later I’m just about to fall back asleep and that same “Ghetto Knock” happens again. I’m furious at this point, about to run out there open the door and give this women a piece of my mind. But I look through the peephole first and it’s a male. He is dressed in practically the same outfit as the women. He is a scrawny looking male, not a physical presences by any means but he looks just as wacked out as her.  I can see her behind the guy jumping up and down laughing, he is looking into the peephole yelling “YO my girl has to pee let us in.” Now I’m a little freaked out, not going to lie. I have seen a lot of situations like this in horror movies, so I just back away from the door, go to the kitchen grab a knife, go back to my room and sit in my closet. Lol, I figured if they were going to break in at least they wouldn’t see me at first in the closet and I could launch a counter attack.

  2 hours pass, no more noises, and I fall asleep in my closet with knife in hand. Then I hear tapping on my bedroom window, it startles me awake, my bedroom is on the first floor and is accessible from the back yard. The lights are off so I creep over to the window and push aside slowly one of the blinds. It’s the women peering into my bedroom but not looking directly at me just subtly tapping the window. And off in the distance was the guy butt ass naked doing cannonballs into my pool! I instinctively without thinking yell, “Hey get out of my pool!” (so dumb lol) Which brings her attention straight to me, we make eye contact, we are inches away from each other and eyes wide opened, had the scariest smile, and starts giggling. That freaked me the hell out. Instantly call the cops tell them some crazy drugged up wackos are in my backyard, I fear for my life please send someone. Went into my bathroom locked the door just waiting for the “Here’s Johnny!” moment to happen. Dispatcher informed me cops where their but no one was outside the house. They must have ran off into the alley when the cops showed up. 

  The next day I see neighborhood watch fliers all over informing us that over the past 3 nights 6 homes had been broken into, 4 dogs brutally tortured and killed and to keep an eye out for any strange people in the neighborhood. Hairs on my neck stood straight up. But I never heard from or seen those two wackos since. Installed an alarm system, got a handgun, I sleep great now. But that look on that women’s face still haunts my dreams. [put up some pictures to help depict the scene better](http://imgur.com/a/8hcBq#0)"	t5_2t3t8	True

Hi, friends! Alright, I won't keep you long, but I wanted to let all of you know what you've done for me.

In late march, I applied for emancipation with my mom, and moved out. I still haven't seen Brian, and I'm starting classes at UCF this fall.
I wouldn't have been able to push through the setbacks I've had without what you said, and the help some of you have individually gave me.

These six months of adult life have been splendorous, and you all gave me the confidence to pursue it before things got worse.
The individuals among you who added me on facebook and just entertain me are also wonderful.

About my sister, and Brian.. he and my mother are divorcing, and he's probably going to get custody of my sister, part time. My mom and I have a good relationship, and I hear Brian is working now to support Rachel and is EXTREMELY scared of me after what happened.

All I can say at this point is thank you. I hope each and every one of you feels kindness, inspiration and hope like you gave me.

also i'm healthy now

My siblings and I are pretty spaced out age-wise. My older sister was born 9 years ahead of me, 2nd oldest sister is 7 years older, and my younger brother is 2 years younger than me. I'm the lower-middle child, a girl, now 21, but at the time, I was 7-12/13.

When my sister was in high school, my parents were separated, so my mom took a job with a ton of hours to support us, since my dad was a deadbeat. That's another story entirely. My sister ended up pretty much raising myself and my brother. She also started dating a dude named Brad.

Brad seemed really nice at first. I was 7, and I thought he was the bees-knees. He was a little off, but it was the kind of ""off"" that makes you go ""awe you're so nerdy!"" when you're older and into boys like that.

They moved in together pretty quickly despite their age, and I would often go over so my sister could babysit me. Being 16 and on her own (taking care of my deadbeat dad, no less), she had a job and shit to take care of, even when I was there, so sometimes I would sit with Brad in his computer room. She would completely break down if she knew what happened when she left me alone with him.

It started out normal. We would play computer games and laugh at stuff online. Then, it started getting a little weird. I wanted to look up cats to arm myself with information so I could beg my mom to let me get one. He kept going to porn sites instead and saying it was an accident. He started staying on them longer and longer, until eventually he just went to them and said he'd rather watch that. I was 7-8, so I really didn't know what was going on.

He started getting really touchy, too. Putting his hand on my legs/inner thigh, hugging me from behind and letting his hand slip to not-so-appropriate areas and whatnot. Commenting on my body. Trying to undo my pants. I stopped going into his computer room. I refused to be alone with him. I didn't know what was going on, but I was scared of him.

When I was 11 or 12, I went to my sisters for dinner. I hadn't been there in a while, simply because I wanted to avoid her husband. Brad spent the entire time staring at my chest. I was really uncomfortable, but when I pointed it out to my sister later, she said it was ""because he hadn't seen me in so long and I looked so grown up"" and that he wasn't looking at my chest, just at me in general.

Finally, my sister divorced him when he asked for an ""open marriage."" While she was cleaning her stuff out of the house they were living in, she decided to check out his email and browsing history. She found pictures of me, and several emails to his friends saying how badly he wanted to have sex with me, and how he ""hoped I would resist"", as well as multiple rape and underage porn sites in his browsing history.

He's now under suspicion for the murder of his mom, and is currently undergoing trial for rape and molestation of minors. Yes, that is plural. I'm not testifying. It would kill my sister to know what he did.

It's not as bad as a lot of the stories on here, and I left out a lot of unsavory details, but I hate to think what would have happened if I'd stuck around."	t5_2t3t8	True
1370000312.0	1fecod	Machete Man	Kimberz00	257	41	33	"Sorry in advance for such a long post I just wanted to get as much detail as I could.  Also I should mention I am female, and at the time I was 21. 

About 2 years ago, My husband, 18 month old son and I were visiting my parents in Connecticut. My grandparents were also visiting, and we were all staying in one house. Around midnight everyone was asleep beside me and my grandmother. 

We decided to watch a movie in the living room, since we are both insomniacs. She went upstairs to get the movie, and I was sitting on a couch that is pushed up against the window. It's very dark, with only the tv being on. A Loud tap tap tap on the window behind me makes me jump. I see it is 2 police officers and get a little nervous.

 When I go to the door, they speak to me very quietly almost whispering for me to step outside. I do. ""Are you the girl that made the distress call?"" I tell them no, and they must have the wrong house. The first officer then says ""we received a call from someone saying that there is a naked man with a machete trying to break into this house"". 

I am in a complete shock at this point, and kind of laugh nervously which the second officer didn't like. He pretty much pushed pass me and went inside while saying he needs to look around inside. I didn't interfere. They look around downstairs and I run upstairs to tell my family what's going on. I look outside and see there are an additional 4 cop cars in the driveway now. 

As I'm heading back downstairs, the second officer is RUNNING upstairs with his gun drawn and burst through the second floor door to the garden. I see the naked man holding the machete just standing there! He started to run, but he gave in rather quickly and went down to his knees and put his hands on the back of his head. The policeman told me he saw the man from downstairs just staring through the door at me with the knife at his neck. 


The naked man went on to tell the cops he was cutting the grass to feed his goats... Showing he's psycho since it was January and there was snow on the ground. Anyway, someone from the McDonald's parking lot saw the guy and made the call. And I'm pretty damn sure saved our lives!  I still have nightmares of that creepy night. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1351785390.0	12gniw	"""Hey sweetheart, need a ride?"""	TheJulie	254	33	7	"When I was a kid, my parents were impossibly strict.  I was never given much opportunity to do things with friends, because my mother was confident that I'd end up doing drugs or having sex and whatever else her imagination could conjure up.  The exception were a few Asian friends - my mother, a Thai woman, was inherently trusting of girls who were fully Asian (not mixed like me) and was less strict about my spending time with them.  And so it happened that one day, Lynn, a Chinese girl with two Chinese parents, invited me to the mall and my mother actually said yes, and even gave me $20 bucks for the bus, lunch, and maybe even a little something nice.  

Unfortunately, when I got to Lynn's house (only a few streets away), she sadly announced that some family had shown up unexpectedly and she wouldn't be able to go. 

To describe my disappointment would be impossible - I was 14, and this was supposed to be the first real ""without my parents"" outing I had ever embarked on, and here was Lynn, telling me it wasn't going to happen.  As she went back inside, I walked away, trudging back towards my house.  But as I walked, the idea hit me: why not just go myself?  I had the money.  I could just get on the bus myself, and go to the mall.

It started off staggeringly successfully - I managed to catch the right bus, got to the mall and wandered around.  I had my first real burrito experience, played games in the arcade, and bought Leather Goddesses of Phobos.  I was having the time of my life.  It was getting dark (it was February, so dark came around 6pm) so I decided it was time to head back home.  I got on the bus, paid my fare and told the driver where I was headed.   The driver shook his head and informed me that he didn't go that far.  What's more, I had caught the last bus leaving the mall for the day, and that by the time he got me to the transfer station to catch the right bus, the buses would be done running.  I put on a brave face, and asked him how close he could get me.  He described a spot about 2 miles from my house, so I agreed that that was fine. 

He dropped me off where we had discussed, which happened to be outside a Dunkin' Donuts.  Being that it was February, and that I was woefully underdressed for any significant amount of time outside, I went inside and bought myself a hot cocoa.  Armed with my cocoa, I started the trek home.  

About 1/4 mile into the walk, I approached an area that had always given me a little pause.  It was just beyond the railroad tracks - in fact, it was the area my mind always conjured up when someone used the phrase ""the wrong side of the tracks"".  There was even a strip club on the corner and a few run-down houses.  I was determined to be brave, though, and continued on resolutely.  Just as I crossed the tracks, an oncoming red Econoline van (I will never forget this vehicle) slowed to a stop and the driver rolled down his window.  He gave me a friendly smile and say ""Hey sweetheart, need a ride?""

Now, I may have been a dumb 14 year old who hadn't had enough sense to realize that going to the mall alone in the first place (dressed in a short skirt and tight turtleneck, no less) was a bad idea, but I knew with every fiber of my being that taking a ride from strangers, and this particular stranger especially, was a very bad idea.  I tried to smile casually and waved vaguely ahead at a house nearby.  ""Nah,"" I said, ""I just live over there.""  He looked back at the direction I was indicating, looked at me and shrugged.  ""Alright,"" he said, ""but it's awfully cold out here.""  I just laughed and waved goodbye.  He pulled away and drove off.  Moments later though, he drove by again, having apparently pulled a U-turn somewhere behind me.  Just seeing his van again, made my heart skip a beat, but he drove past me without slowing or even looking at me.  He turned the corner ahead  and I breathed a sigh of relief.  As I rounded the corner, though, my heart dropped.  He was parked in the strip club's parking lot, with his van pulled in backwards so that it faced the street, his parking lights on.  I couldn't see in through the windshield, but I tried to act like I hadn't even noticed him, and tried to act casual. 

I've created this map to try to make it easier to follow the events.  [This is the actual scene of the situation](http://minus.com/lHJ7dVNQrIK3j) (though it looks a bit different here than it did 20something years ago).   The red circles are his positions and movements, and the blue are mine.

I was already rounding the corner, but once I saw him, I tried to inconspicuously change routes and tried to act like I was headed for the house across the street.  I calmly walked around the back of the house, as if I maybe lived in the back, and just stood there, trying to listen for signs of him driving away.  I was terrified, however, when I saw headlights lighting up the driveway that you see running alongside the house (leading to a business that was clearly not open) and sure enough, his van drove slowly into view.  I was frozen in fear.  He reached the end of the driveway, and turned around, slowly heading up.  I could see him looking in my direction, but couldn't tell if he had actually seen me.  As soon as he started up the driveway again, I forced my legs into motion, ran around the other side of the house, and fled onto the front porch and hid.  I hid for what seemed like hours, and I prayed someone would open the door and find me, but I was too afraid to actually knock on the door and ask for help.  Eventually, half frozen and scared and knowing that it was starting to get late and my mother was going to start wondering where I was, I peeked over the railing and scanned for any sign of him.  I didn't see any, so I started running home.  

I still had over 1.5 miles to go before I got home, and even at 14, I couldn't sustain a run very long, especially in my half-frozen condition.  The walk seemed to take forever, and at every sign of a vehicle larger than a car, I would duck behind a tree or hide behind a bush.  The entire time, I was mapping getaway routes.  ""If he catches up to me *here*, where would I go?""  I can honestly say I have never been so terrified in my life.

Less than a mile from home, I saw a large vehicle headed towards me, that seemed to have the same round headlights as an Econoline van.  My heart just plummeted, and I dove behind a bush.  That I didn't pee myself when the driver slowed down is a wonder.  I heard the window go down, and amazingly, blissfully, I heard my mother's voice say ""Julie?!""  I stood up, and there she was, in our Ford Bronco, peering at me in confusion.  I think I went from behind the bush to inside the car in a single bound.  

I can say that I caught some serious hell that night for lying, being stupid, etc.  But hell never felt so good, because the entire time, I could only think about what might have happened."	t5_2t3t8	True

I get off of work and find out the bus wont be there for about 40 minutes and decide to walk down to Santa Monica blvd and take that bus. I am sitting at the stop slightly annoyed and hungry when a dude asks if I need a ride. 

He seemed nice enough, and I am a 25 year old male capable of defending myself who has hitch hiked quite a few times in my life. Nice car, chubby guy, glasses, over all nice guy. 

I say sure why not and hop in, making sure to keep my finger on the lock on the door and watch his every move. We talk a bit, he's a little strange. I tell him I hate my job, he tells me to apply where he works. Over all, no biggie, he's just a weird guy. He drops me off near my place and we shake hands and I thank him. I actually said ""Thanks Dennis, you're a really good guy""

As I am getting out he says ""Hey, interested in making $20?"" 

""Hell nah man, what did you want?"" I asked laughing, disgusted but curious, I had to know.

He looks me up and down ""Just some pictures""

""OH HELL NAH!""


EDIT (the day after): So I just got home...........guess who I saw pulling into the Walgreens parking lot......He said ""Hey, how ya been?"" I shot him a look that said I would murder him, and said ""Fine.""

He didn't come into Walgreens, I waited inside for him to come in to confront him. I hope it's all a misunderstanding. *Hopefully* he was just too embarrassed to come inside, saw his car getting gas at the station across the street I think.


It was the same street, around the same time......I hope it is just a coincidence, otherwise, **SUPER COOL THIS IS A THING NOW**"	t5_2t3t8	True
1374634926.0	1ixjdm	The one day my parents trusted me to be alone	LZsteelerz	248	31	46	"Let me preface this by saying thank you to the people who developed that creepy smile guy video or else I would not have found this reddit to share my encounter.

Years ago when I was in second grade (22 now) my parents one monday morning finally felt confidant in allowing me to come home from school by myself and stay home without a baby sitter until they came home. That morning my father gave me the house key, showed me the emergency numbers in the yellow book and gave me instructions on what to do if stupid things happened like the house catching on fire...

After school that day I came home, put the key in the door and walked into my open house. I felt free and I felt privligedged that I was finally a ""big boy"" and that I could now be home on my own. Needless to say I kinda got caught up in the moment and ate tons of ice cream while watching Terminator on VHS since my parents would NEVER let me watch anything over PG13.

Around 5:00 that day I heard the doorbell ring. My dad told me never to answer the door by myself even if they were home. I walked to our family room where I could get a good view of who was there, maybe my dad was getting a package or something (he did always enjoy ordering things online). I saw a middle age man standing there in a dark black jacket that ive never seen before. He rang the doorbell again and I expected him to leave after no one answered. 

After a third ring I saw him walk down the steps and assumed he was leaving. I went back to watching terminator when I noticed something outside my kitchen window. The man was walking in our backyard for some odd reason. I felt scared for my life since some stranger was on my property. I ran under the kitchen table and grabbed the cordless phone from the counter and proceeded to call my dad's work number.

My dad answered and I exclaimed how some strange man was in the backyard and was now proceeding to try and open our sliding door. My dad told me to stay where I was and call the neighbors, he would call 911. I told my dad I loved him and he said he would call me immediately after he called 911.

Before I could call my neighbors the man was able to somehow open our family room window. I feared for my life and ran to the bathroom and locked the door and called our neighbors. After about 30 seconds I heard my neighbor running through our house shouting my name to see if I was ok. She said how she saw no one in the house and we stayed in the bathroom until the police arrived.

The police conducted their investigation and told us they found some fingerprints that matched a recently released convict who was previously put in jail for breaking into homes.

After that day my parents did not leave me without a babysitter until I went to high school...every week I wonder what happened; did he run when he saw someone was in the house, did my neighbor scare him away if he heard her yelling?

Needless to say after that day and even after I was allowed to stay home without a babysitter I never stayed home alone. I was either at a friend's house or an after school program until my parents came home. I still feel unsafe being home alone.

I hope you enjoyed my experience, im glad I found this subreddit to share it with you all."	t5_2t3t8	True
1339623129.0	v0ikv	Customer never got their tv...	omegam0	254	36	18	"This is my first post here, and I thought I would share. I used to work as a dish network installer, not the best job, but not the worst. We sometimes worked in pairs or by ourselves, and I have a ton of similar storys. One day I had to go to a job by myself to install a dish system. When I got there it was a woman in her late 40's, she seemed nice enough, even offered me water while I was outside. When I had to go and install the dish box inside both her living room and bedroom is when things got...wierd. I decided to hook up the living room first, I got in there and while I was hooking it up I noticed lots of unlabled vhs movies laying around, and some that had writte on them titles like ""hot summer"" ""naked beach"" and ""plummers choice"". I thought they seemed odd but didnt think too much about it while working. The entire time I was doing that she would talk to me asking me what I thought about the job, asked me my name, my age, and told me how she was a widow for a few years. After I got the first box done I told her that I would get the next box, she said she was going to go outside the back and have a ciggarette and showed me the room before I went back to the van to get the box. I got to the van, called my boss to check in and let him know my progress, got the box and went into the bedroom. Once I got in there I noticed the tv on the other side of the bed next to a window. As I got to the tv and started to make room for the box and make sure the cable I jacked into was near enough (didnt want to have to run a cable, and thankfully the ones she had were up to code enough not too), I heard the bedroom door close, when I turned around she is standing there in nothing but a see through gown. She told me to be her bad service boy or something and that she wanted to film me with her. I explained that its against policy and that I was married. She said she didnt care and wasnt going to tell anyone unless I didnt do it. I told her to please step outside the room and let me leave. She kept refusing and tried to walk closer, at this point I remembered the window, and noticed it was open, so I dove through (sadly the screen was there, but hey it came out with me). I ran to my van and immediatly called my boss. he told me to stay there and he was coming himself, when he got there he asked what was left inside, I told him. He said he would be right back and went to the door, he knocked and she came to the door still in the gown, he asked if she would kindly change clothes and come back and get him so he could get my stuff out of there. At this point she asked him if we could have a three way. His face turned so red I almost immediatly laughed. He than turned around walked back to me and said that he would re-issue me for anything left and that he was calling the office to let them know not to activate her dish, and to send a team of people to come get the boxes and tools. from what I heard from some other techs I worked with they ended up having to call the police because she wouldnt let them in and kept trying to tell them that we raped her. (whether it happened or not policy stated that it was immediate termination if a customer calls about something like this or files a police report on it). Thankfully I never had to deal with her again, and I found that even the phone company had the same problem with her. Sadly my boss quit two days later because he was tired of dealing with messed up customers all the time. Sorry for my bad story telling and thanks for reading."	t5_2t3t8	True
1372755355.0	1hhj50	Waiting in a parking lot	Tawtaml	242	25	26	"When I was a 14 year old (girl) I was waiting in a parking lot in my mother's truck. She was at her doctor's office and I had opted to stay behind to read in the backseat. Luckily for me I was slightly paranoid as a child and I locked all the doors. 

About ten minutes after my mother went upstairs a station wagon pulled into the lot and screeched to a stop right behind my truck. Literally parked across the rear of the truck blocking it in. Out of the station wagon came a grey haired old man. He quickly came to my door and grabbed the handle. He never made eye contact with me. 

I froze in place. I felt like I couldn't do anything. He started shaking the handle violently and pulling on the door. It was an old truck so the door moved quite a bit. I was scared thinking the lock would fail or something.

It was then I remembered my mother had left her dead cellphone in the front seat. I grabbed the phone and made a show of pretending to make a call and the man looked up at me then ran back to his car and took off.

When my mother returned she took me to the police station and I gave them a description of the man and the car. They promised to call if they heard anything. 

About a week later an officer called and informed us the man had been caught. Apparently he tried to get two seven year old twin boys into his car and their father had seen it happening. The father ran up and hit the guy with a baseball bat while screaming at him to stay away from his kids. After the initial hit he grabbed onto the guy and had a passerby call the police.

I'm still glad to this day I had locked the doors of that truck. I was scared of staying behind alone in cars for a long time after that. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1372043571.0	1gy2lk	Pest Control Weirdo [NSFW]	Starbuckface	276	59	29	"This story isn't quite as awful or terrifying as I'm sure most of you might hope it to be. To me, it's actually pretty amusing on my part, but it's also pretty creepy. Also, 25 male here. I was maybe 21 at the time.

If you've ever lived in an apartment, I'm sure you've ran into some instance where you needed to spray your house. Once, a few years ago, we had a pretty nasty ant invasion in our unit so of course, I called management and they sent a guy over really early one morning.

I was still asleep when he knocked on the door, so I threw on some pajama pants and let him in. He was an older Latin guy with a thick mustache, maybe 35-40, a little stocky. Now, I had to piss like a horse as usual in the morning so I went to do that while he did his spraying and such.

So I go about my business while he's there, checking emails and stuff, and after about 10 minutes he comes in to let me know he's finished. So I get up and we head to the door so I can let him out, and I notice he gets this weird, happy little grin on his face.

We stop in the kitchen so I can sign his work order, and as I do so he leans on the counter, staring at me with that same smile. I tried to avoid eye contact, because his eyes were also smiling and it was disconcerting. It was like a romantic expression, but with a look of desperation or expectancy-I couldn't tell, but felt uneasy so I signed the document quickly and let him out. 

As he said goodbye, he paused outside the door and turned to me as if he was going to say something, still with that creepy look on his face, like he wanted me to say something. He never said anything though, and after a very long 10-15 seconds I curtly said bye and shut the door.

As I head back to my computer, I'm creeped out but ready to start my day when I feel a cool breeze down below. I look, and realize that my dick is hanging out of the flap in my pajama pants. Yep!

I was so sleepy I guess that I never put it away after I took a piss, and this guy definitely noticed and most likely thought I was making some kind of offer and everything clicked.

The pest problem didn't go away, but I took care of it myself after that.

1371143318.0	1ga1i3	Third party stalking and me in the middle.	DasBarenJager	241	23	15	"I work at a restaurant and cover many roles, my favorite of which is delivering food since it allows me a chance to engage people and use my personality to make tips. Last summer we had a tough time finding full time delivery drivers who could pass a drug test so about 80% of my time was spent on the road and quite a few of my deliveries were to a local college campus. 

I took an order for a young man who wanted to buy a meal for his girlfriend, he gave me her name and what dorm she resides in and paid for the pizza with his credit card and the phone call was pretty much a standard delivery request. Things did get weird though when I showed up at the dorm and the girl was nowhere to be found, her RA's said she wasn't in her room and eventually one of the other girls in the building told me she was in class. I called the guys phone number to tell him and he just blew me off, no big deal though because he already paid for the food so really all I lost out on was a tip and some time out of my day.

A few days later this guy call's again and places an order, same deal so I ask him if he is sure his girlfriend is there and he replies that yes he is positive that she is in her dorm. So I make the food and drive over to the campus to make the delivery, the girl is not waiting in the lobby like she should be so I have an RA run up to her room to get her. The girl makes her way down eventually and tells me she did not order anything, I tell her its no problem because her boyfriend ordered for her and I read her his name off of the credit card receipt. The girl then loses her shit and starts having a panic attack.

Apparently she did not have a boyfriend and the guy in question had been stalking her since high school and had somehow followed her to another state where she wanted to attend college. She had no idea how he found her or figured out where she lived, and she was DEEPLY upset that he now knew exactly when she was in her building and when she wasn't. I tried to calm her down but an RA saw her freak out and called campus security, who I then had to deal with for the next hour. The guy who ordered the pizza would not answer any of my calls this time. 

A week guys by with no more word from the creep until we finally get a call from him wanting us to deliver more food and this time if one of us would pick up flowers for her as well, I put him on hold and grab our GM who then informs him we will no longer be accepting any orders that he places and that the police will be notified if he tries to harass anyone using our store again. 

This was about a year ago and he hasn't called to place an order since the GM scared him away however we would get orders placed through the internet for the girl with creepy messages for her on them for months. We deleted the orders every time but that bastard was very persistent.  

EDIT: So at work tonight my GM came in to help out during a late night rush and I asked him about it, he has no clue if the girl was ever able to press charges against him for anything but someone who used to work for him at another store know's the creeper and the guy ran out of money and had to move back out of state and into his parent's house a few months after the whole incident. I guess the reason we got the orders placed online instead of over the phone was because he was doing it from out of state and did not have a cell phone. Either way he was a long way from the girl and I assume she was able to finish college in relative peace. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1352153075.0	12ovzb	He flashed me, another creeper saved me.	Moralester	260	40	21	"I've been lurking LetsNotMeet the past few days, and decided I should post this, because it's pretty bad. I still have issues about what happened to this day.

So, a little background about this before I get into the actual story. I started working at this restaurant when I was about 15 and it was...interesting. The staff was mainly older female waitresses in the morning (when it was busier) and young high school or college aged girls working at night. The cooks, on the other hand, consisted mostly of 20-40 year old men, some of whom had been to jail or were into drugs. They weren't really dangerous, just druggies. 

Anyways, there was three cooks that I worked with pretty often. One, James, was a bit of a creeper, but he was doing it just to freak people out. Like, he would ask to smell your shoe. He just had a strange sense of humor. This other guy, Cliff, was who I thought was the creepiest. He was probably about 30, but he did acid and often came into work right after smoking weed. He was really friendly towards us girls, but he also had a temper and would yell at people if they messed up. I was really quiet though, and he never yelled at me. He would talk to me a lot and eventually started asking for hugs. It was a bit creepy, but I kind of got along with him, and didn't want him mad at me, so I complied. Don't get me wrong, it was never a sexual sort of hug. Looking back on it now, I think he just liked me because I always tried, unlike most of the wait staff who didn't give a fuck, so he thought we were kinda friends. It was just weird because I was 16, and he was like 30. The third cook was in his 40's, his name was Paul. Paul was a bit strange, but since he had kids, I assumed he was okay. He just made up lots of stories (you could tell he was lying just to get you to laugh or whatever), and was always fishing for compliments, but otherwise was okay.   

Anyways, onto the story. One day, it's Paul and Cliff in the kitchen, my manager Jake, the other waitress Silvia, and me up in the front taking orders. At night we didn't have a busser because we never got too busy, so we had to put dishes into bus bins, and take them to the back ourselves. One of the bus bins were full, so I took it back. There is only one camera in the kitchen area, and the sink where the dishes go is behind a corner, out of it's view. I got back there, and start putting the dishes in the sink, when Paul comes back there.
Paul: ""Hey.""
Me: ""Hey.""
Paul: ""Doin' dishes?""
Me: ""Yup.""
Paul: ""Hey, can I show you something?""
I turn around to look at him. **HIS FUCKING DICK IS OUT.**

I just sort of stood there, frozen. I was 16, and had never had a boyfriend, never seen a penis in real life before. He was kind of blocking my way, and took a step closer, when all of the sudden I hear **""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?""**
It's Cliff, and he comes back there and shoves Paul against a wall. I book it out of there as fast as I could, and went and told the manager. He goes in back to talk to Paul, and Cliff comes up and asks if I'm alright, and said that if Paul touched me, he would kick his ass. At this point I'm crying, but Cliff is kind of making me laugh, telling me how he was going to cut Paul's penis off and stuff. 

Anyways, I quit after that night, and never went back to that restaurant. I never got the police involved because I didn't really want anyone to know what happened. Plus, it was off camera, so there wasn't a lot of evidence. Paul was fired, and my boss asked if I would come back, but I declined. To this day, I really don't like being alone with older guys in a room. It freaks me out. I don't know what would have happened if Cliff hadn't showed up. I guess I kind of misjudged him. He was probably just a lonely, socially awkward, but decent guy. The thing that freaks me out is that Paul has a young daughter. Hopefully his ex wife found out and has full custody of the kids. This happened about two years ago, and I still haven't been back, so I never really found out what happened. 

TL;DR The cook I thought was the normal one flashed me, and the one I thought was creeping on me saved me.

1340223217.0	vcg22	Freaking out a peeping tom	taheca	250	31	38	"Not eerie like some of these posts, but rather funny. Consider this a palate cleanser from the creepiness.

So I am a total night owl, and frequently walk 3-5 miles late at night around my town. I love it because there is never ANYONE out (except occasionally random groups of kids), and my area has a lot of sidewalks and walking trails.

One trail is dark and goes right behind a long line of nice houses. they all have relatively big yards and since I walk the path frequently I know it very well.

One night a few weeks ago I was out at my usual time, right around 11.  I am always amazed on this path because people don't usually close their windows and blinds, and occasionally you look over at a house and see people. It always makes me laugh, but not being a peeping tom I just keep walking.

As I am walking down the path I look over and see a figure standing alone in a back yard and looking towards the house. I at first thought it was probably the homeowner but something seemed off. The guy had his hands in front of him and was just acting creepy.

I am a light walker and decide that perhaps I should investigate and walk over, as I get behind him I can see over his shoulder and have line of sight into a family room where a girl and boy are naked and pretty close to having sex. 

This guy had evidently hit the goldmine and was having his own personal peep show. It also seemed like he was making sure he enjoyed himself if you know what I mean.

I walked quietly up behind him until I was about two feet away, turned sideways (to make myself less of a target/and or run if attacked) and said very quietly and calmly.

""What are you doing?

I have never seen anyone jump as high as he did in my life. I had completely surprised him and he let out a yell and ran away at an angle around the front of the house and away from me.

The couple must have heard something because suddenly the drapes were closed to the room and I resumed my walk.  In hindsight, and after telling my wife, I probably should not have done what I did. He could have had a weapon, but I had followed my instinct and it all worked out.  I doubt I will ever see him again, I am pretty sure I scared the crap out of him.

While I was waiting a really disgusting shady old man approached me, but of course I was young and stupid and thought he was just being nice when he actually asked me ""Do you want some candy little girl?"" and handed me a tootsie roll. I put the tootsie roll in my mouth as my dad was walking around the back of our SUV and he saw me and the man and ran up as the old man ran way faster than I expected he'd be capable of. My dad smacked me in the back of my head to get me to spit out the candy and picked it up and in it was a little white pill. He called the cops and of course they said there wasn't anything they could really do. Not 100% on what the pill was but I was an idiot as a kid obviously."	t5_2t3t8	True
1358147194.0	16jgge	"""Artie"""	Booty-B	260	44	23	"Okay, so let me just say right now that I consider myself a tough girl. I don't let people intimidate me under any circumstances. Artie was different though. I think he is the only person I've ever truly been afraid of.

So let's start from the beginning. My girlfriend and I had just broken up, and I was feeling pretty shitty. All I wanted was someone's attention. I wanted someone to make me feel special. So when Artie texted me and asked me if I wanted to go on a date, I jumped on the offer. I was good friends with Artie's sister. I'm one of the few girls in my school that knows enough sign language where I can communicate with her. I figured he knew I was gay, and he was just being nice because I was always a good friend to his little sister. We made plans to dress up nice and go to a fancy dinner at the only classy restaurant
in our town. 

Everything went okay at first. He was polite, and interesting enough. I figured he and I could become really good friends. Then, when we got into his car to go home, shit got weird. He started by placing his hand on my leg, just above the knee. I felt a little uncomfortable by the contact, but not to the point where I wanted to make a scene. I thought maybe he was just one of those people who liked physical contact. No warning signs yet. 

He turned to me and smiled. ""Let's go to the movies, I really don't want to end this date just yet.""  I tried to politely tell him no. That I had to get home because my parents were expecting me home at a certain time (we had spent hours at the restaurant, just talking and enjoying each other's company) he insisted though. He made it clear that he wasn't going to take me home. So I agreed, figuring that he wouldn't try anything in a crowded theater. I sat through the entire movie, praying that he'd let me go home afterwards. Luckily, when the movie was over, he agreed to take me home. 

On the way back home in his car, he started touching my leg again. Just above the knee like before, but this time, he started to slide his hand up until rested on my inner thigh. I was in a dress that was long enough where I didn't need leggings, so his hands were on my bare skin. I looked over at him, he had the smile. All toothy, and whatnot. Creep. I pushed his hand away and he seemed to get the message, he didn't try touching me again.

When we got to my house I tried to gather all my things as fast as I could. I was so ready to go inside and forget that this whole date had ever happened. I was about to reach for the handle when he locked the doors. Oh. My. God. I felt like I was in a horror film. This isn't supposed to happen in real life. Creepy guys don't just lock you into their cars, so they can do god knows what to you. I looked over at him. He had that stupid fucking smile again. That stupid, toothy smile. I was at the end of my rope. I wanted out of his car, and I wanted him out of my life.

""Artie, if you don't let me go, I'm going to kick the shit out of you. I swear."" I tried my best to sound menacing, but I probably sounded like a scared little girl. That's how I felt inside anyway. He didn't say anything, he just climbed out of seat and got on top of me. Now let me tell you, this guy was heavy. He easily outweighed me by 100lbs, maybe more. The point is that I wasn't going anywhere. He pinned my arms down and started kissing my neck, down to my chest. I felt so helpless, I just started crying like a little pussy. I had no idea how I was going to get out of this. Why hadn't my mom come out to check on me? Artie and I weren't even 20 feet away from my house. 

Then he kissed me. Hard. He bit down on my lip hard enough to draw blood. That was my breaking point. I started screaming and kicking as much as I could. Making it as difficult for him to violate me as I could. I wasn't going to let this dude rape me. I bit down on his shoulder as hard as I could. He yelled and let me go. I turned and unlocked my door and fell out of the car. I ran into my house and locked the door and pulled all the curtains shut. My mom was waiting for me in the kitchen. I sat down at the table and started sobbing. I was on the verge of having a panic attack as I told my mother what had happened.

I ended up getting a restraining order on Artie, but sadly, this wasn't the last encounter I had with the psycho. I have a few more stories, but I don't want to make this wall of text any longer. Maybe I'll post more later.

1348527664.0	10f21r	Led the Creeper Straight Home	Vilda_Chaya	241	24	10	"When I was 14, my mother, sister and I had been dealing with mom's stalker ex-boyfriend for months. We were all feeling pretty worn out and traumatized. Mom took us to a family member's home in California for a few days break from the stress. We went there a lot, it used to be my favorite place in the world. We brought along my 16 year old cousin Rachael, who was my best friend at the time.

We were staying in a house on a bluff overlooking the beach. Our place was the third to last condo on the bluff. On the far right of the condos was a grassy/muddy slope that went down to the edge of the bluff, with heavy trees at the top of the hill. There was no lighting, it was as dark as it possibly could be. My cousin went over there to smoke. We stumbled down giggling and shushing each other and feeling extra grown up for needing a place to secretly smoke cigarettes. We weren't scared. We had grown up visiting there. We had a false sense of security because of the gates, never mind the fact that there was an unlocked staircase right off the beach into the complex.

Suddenly, we both stopped talking. We hadn't heard or seen anything, we both got that feeling of being watched. We turned in unison and stared up at the trees behind us. It was incredibly dark and we couldn't see anything, we just had a really awful feeling. The sound of the ocean made it hard to hear at first but as we fell silent, we could hear it clearly. It was breathing. 

""Hello?""

There was a shuffling noise, but no reply.

""We can hear you over there. Heyyyy, do you need a light?"" My cousin giggled but then her smile slowly vanished. There was no answer. 

Rachael threw her cigarette down and we turned and started to walk back up to the house at a double pace. As we crested the hill we heard footsteps stumbling down behind us, from the trees, and we broke into a run, with the footsteps picking up behind. Someone was chasing us and we couldn't see a single thing. We could hear breathing but whoever was chasing us wasn't saying a WORD. Not stop, or hey, or anything. We ran as fast we could. We stumbled up to the house and slammed the gate behind us, slammed the door and locked it.

 Peeking out afterward, we couldn't see anyone or anything. We thought about telling my mom but then she would've asked what we had been up to. We decided to keep it to ourselves. We didn't think very much of it because we were dumb, invincible teenagers. We told ourselves it was probably a kid trying to scare us. 

My cousin went to bed. My sister and I fell asleep watching TV on the living room floor. The main wall of the living room was glass, a huge sliding door facing out onto a low porch and the bluff underneath. The sliding mechanism was broken and required a stick jammed in the door to lock it. Sometimes we remembered and sometimes we didn't...that night, we remembered.

At about 3 AM, I woke up to the sound of someone pounding with all their might on the front door. It was actually shaking the house. I thought it was the police.

""THIS IS SECURITY. OPEN THE DOOR. OPEN THE DOOR. YOU'RE IN DANGER."" A man's voice was shouting. He was shining a flashlight into the little frosted glass windows beside the door. My mother whispered for us to lie as still as we possibly could. She crept about halfway up the steps and said something to the effect of ""What's the problem"" and he yelled that a man had been seen breaking in to our home and we needed to open the door NOW. The voice got angrier and more frantic. 

""SECURITY, OPEN UP NOW!"" He demanded. A second later, more frantic pounding.  My mother yelled that he needed to leave and have the security people call us.  

""SECURITY OPEN THE DOOR OPEN THE DOOR OPEN THE DOOR"" 

My mother screamed some male name, like she was calling her husband. She shouted that she and her husband were both armed and that she had already called the police. The pounding abruptly stopped.  
 
Obviously, he was not a security guard. They never found the person  who had been banging on the door. They found a rock that was dragged down the bluff path and pushed up against the bottom of the porch as a stepping stone. There was a small pile of Camel butts by the sliding glass door. 

My mother smoked Marlboros. I have no idea how long he was sitting outside on the porch in the dark, smoking cigarettes and watching me and my 4 year old sister sleep.

There were more butts up in the trees. I'm absolutely sure that he dropped back and watched us run up to the house, then went to the trees to wait until it got later. A lot of the magic of that place was gone after that. The actual police were called, but nothing came of it. FWIW, it wasn't the stalker ex...he didn't have a car. Whoever it was was never caught. Nothing else ever happened, but I never really felt safe there again. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1371627830.0	1gn5ig	Home Invasions	xaane	247	32	12	"Hey guys. I'm new to Reddit (always thought it was the place people go to share cat pictures) but someone pointed out to some subreddits, this being one of them, I got hooked and now I'm here.

To give you some background: I'm generally not easily scared. I like to stretch my mind and see how far I can go. Zombie nightmares? No problem. Scary movies? I've watched them all. I did notice, however, that there's one thing that keeps repeating in my dreams: I'm terrified of home invasions. If I ever dream about someone, uninvited, in my house - I freeze, can't move, can't scream, can't run. So I've been doing some thinking as to why that may be and I figured out why.

As a child I lived in a fairly well-off town in Israel (right on the edge of it) that was separated from a not-so-well-off city by a large field.

When I was about 5 or 6, I would sleep in my room with the door open so that I could see into my parents' room across the hall since it made me feel safer. There would be this thing, though... I would wake up in the middle of the night for no particular reason, and just stare at the doorway. Then after a few seconds I would see a silhouette of a person passing by, sometimes pausing at the doorway for a brief second before continuing. It scared the shit out of me and I would force myself to cry so that my parents would come and check on me. They never found anything and attributed it to bad dreams. This probably happened 4-5 times.

About a year later, my parents woke up one day to find the drawers in my dad's desk completely out and empty. My dad asked my mom whether she messed around with them. Clearly, she didn't. We installed an alarm system.

Honestly, with the alarm system it was worse. One night I woke up - again for no apparent reason - and second later this piercing ""aaaannnggghhhh"" rang through the house and wouldn't stop. I freak out, jump out of my bed , and look towards my parents' room. Just then I see a silhouette of a person sprinting across my doorway, down the hallway. By the time my parents got out of their bed and person was already out of the house, leaving the large door to the house wide open.

This happened three fucking times.

We started getting preemptive. We got one of these motion sensors that play a recorded message when activated. My mom recorded a ""GET OUT OF HERE YOU FUCKING THIEF!"" type message, and put it next to the main door of the house. One night I wake up - again, for no apparent reason (although I think I know why by now) - and two seconds later I hear my mom's recorded message cursing at the thief. A few seconds later I hear footsteps of someone running away. At least it worked!

That was the last time *that* happened. 

When I was 13 we moved to another country, but would always go back in the summer to visit our extended family, and typically stayed at my grandma's. One of my favorite things to do is to stay up late at my grandma's house in Tel Aviv, in the living room and watch national geographic after everyone went to sleep. Dunno why, I find it very relaxing.

I was about 14, watching national geographic at 2AM, and I get the *fucking* feeling - the one that made me wake up when I was little ""for no apparent reason"" - except I was awake. I concluded that it's probably nothing, but just in case I put both of my hands up and middle-fingered the whole room slowly. I figured if anyone *was* watching me they would have gone away after seeing that. Heh...

So at around 3AM I decide to go up to my bed on the second floor, but on my way there I notice my mom's bag is on the table. I consider moving it somewhere further away from the window in case someone wanted to grab it with a broomstick or something. I decide not to, because it's probably not gonna happen and ""what if she woke up, won't find it, freak out and call the police?""... 

So I'm in bed, reading a book about ghosts. I was pretty spiritual at 14 and really wanted to believe. 

I say in my mind ""Okay, if you guys are real, give me a sign"".
The light flickers a little.
""Hmm. That could be anything. I'm going to need a bigger sign.""

At that moment I hear a huge *BOOM* from downstairs. I come out of my room at the same time my mom comes out of her room and my grandma comes out of hers. They ask me why I'm making so much noise. I tell them that I'm not and that I think there's somebody downstairs. My mom tells me ""nonsense, it must just be...""

*BOOM*

My mom freaks the fuck out and starts screaming things like ""GET OUT OF HERE YOU THIEF!"" (de ja vu?) and just in general screaming in the direction of the first floor. After a few minutes she goes down and, granted, the window is broken and the bag is gone from the table. Someone took it. With a broomstick.

1357327001.0	15yq8l	Why I don't like being called 'baby'	silly_kendra	259	42	18	"When I was 19, I was living in Indiana with my mom. Our cousin and his wife lived only a few miles from us, and for some reason his wife, Cathy, was hell-bent on 'hooking me up' with someone despite my young age and already hefty baggage of a divorce and a child (different story for a different day).

She found what she believed to be a suitable hookup in the form of her 'friend' Paul, who had done some work around my cousin's house a few times. He was tall, hefty, and he looked like a simple country boy. Since I am not overly concerned with looks and he seemed nice enough, I agreed to hang out with him a few times. For a while Paul seemed alright. We had texted each other a little but I had made it very clear that I was not interested in a relationship, being newly single with a baby, but that we could be friends. He still let me know that he had a definite romantic interest in me, but he claimed he was fine with keeping it friendly and not taking things too far.

One night, only about two weeks after Cathy introduced me to Paul, she invited us over to her and my cousin's house for a barbecue and movie night. After arranging to have my mother watch my daughter, I agreed and Cathy came to pick me up. The barbecue went well, and Paul seemed alright. However, Cathy decided that after eating, she and my cousin were too tired to watch movies or drive me home, so she told me that Paul and I were to spend the night here. As she had no spare bedrooms, we were to sleep on the couches in her living room- one each. As a 19-year-old girl with plenty of energy still burning, I decided I could watch a movie or two before heading to bed, so Paul put something in. Naturally, about halfway through, I began to drift off to sleep, apparently being a bit more burnt out than I had previously thought. Still semi-conscious, I felt a hand on my thigh. Not wanting to spook Paul and perhaps escalate the situation too far, I pretended to be asleep to see where he would take it- perhaps it was fairly innocent, him being a country boy who had not had much experience with women. But before long, he began to slide his hand up toward my crotch, and he was murmuring things like, ""You asleep, baby? Can you feel that?"" He must have suddenly realized that humans are equipped with two hands, and that he should utilize his free hand to grope my breasts. At this point, thoroughly creeped out and a bit peeved, I began to stir. He immediately removed his hands from me and pretended to be watching the movie, confirming my fears that he had waited for me to fall asleep before touching me inappropriately.

I did not sleep the rest of that night, and after that, Paul and I did not speak any more."	t5_2t3t8	True
1357804895.0	16az5q	You never know what you'll see in a neighbor's window. 	Insufficient__Funds	268	56	64	"Hello. I'm relatively new to Reddit, and this is my first time posting in Let's Not Meet. My story is not particularly dramatic, but it is true. 

I live on the third floor of a large house that has been renovated into apartment buildings. The area is urban and relatively affluent, with spacious houses that are very close to one another. Our living room window faces the window of our next door neighbor. I always assumed it was the attic-there seems to be some junk stacked about, and prior to this incident I had never seen movement or light over there. I know it would suit the story to say it was rundown or otherwise creepy, but the house is actually quite nice, if somewhat nondescript. 

I have a newborn daughter, and she's prone to waking at regular intervals in the night to nurse. Being considerate, I take her out of our bedroom to avoid waking my husband and nurse her on the futon, where I have a ""lactation station"" set up (books, a Boppy, ottoman, etc). 

It was the middle of the night, and we were nursing as usual, when to my surprise a light came on in the neighbor's window. Moments later, a man walked past the window, happened to glance up, and paused. So we're staring at one another in these opposing windows, and I'm feeling a bit sheepish so I smile awkwardly. The guy just keeps staring at me with a blank expression on his face. And then, suddenly, he takes off his shirt. Wait, is he....no. Nothing untoward is happening, his hands are in sight. Being very exhausted, I'm not sure how to handle this surreal-but-not-quite-terrifying situation. The guy doesn't look dangerous or even interesting (white, thin, middle-aged, bespectacled, and wearing pajama pants). A minute or so passes, and I finally just give him a little wave. He abruptly turns and walks out of sight, followed by the light going off. 

The following night, my daughter wakes up at roughly the same time. We settle into the Lactation Station, she's nursing contentedly. I haven't given him much thought, so my heart sinks when I look up and notice our neighbor in the window again, shirtless, staring at me with the same blank expression. Now I'm a bit pissed, but I don't want to disturb the baby, so I throw him this aggravated ""what the fuck"" shrug. 

Here's the creepy part, and it's difficult to write without my hair standing on end. This guy slowly leans forward, placing his hands on the glass, and smiles the most leering, menacing, toothy smile I've ever seen. His eyes were wide and straining, and it seemed his cheeks would crack with exertion. And then, just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, he starts LAUGHING AT ME. I mean really laughing, cackling hysterically, with his hands still against the glass and that deranged look on his face. I jumped up and ran into the bedroom, where I nursed the baby in bed with my husband and tried to figure out what the hell just happened. 

It sounds simple, but it's one of the scariest things that's ever happened to me. Especially considering he knows where I live. 

EDIT: Due to mounting interest, I put up my blinds long enough to snap a photo. This is my view from the Lactation Station:  http://imgur.com/mEXEN"	t5_2t3t8	True

When the show ended we decided to share true scary stories we had. This story that my friend shared still creeps me out.

When my friend's dad was younger, his family was really poor and a lot of times he would have to go dumpster diving to try and find food to eat. Well one time, he was in a pretty affluent neighborhood and he opened a trash can to find a bunch of mutilated dogs and cats inside. This really freaked him out (he was really young, plus I think it would freak anybody out) so naturally he ran away.

Well, a couple of weeks later he went back to that neighborhood and was walking around when he saw a man standing outside his garage. The man saw him and pushed his automatic garage door opener while telling him that he ""had a shiny, new bike in the garage just for him"" (side note: this was back when automatic garage door openers were just starting to catch on and were a fairly new thing). My friend's dad started walking towards the door, but then remembered the mutilated animals he had seen weeks earlier, got scared, and ended up running away.

After my friend told me this story, she said that the guy turned out to be this huge serial killer, but she couldn't remember his name. So, she called her dad.

1342891478.0	wxhd5	The AOL Incident	nomnomkittens	290	81	66	"I have a lot of memories of AOL dial-up throughout my childhood and early teenage years. ""A/S/L"" or ""cyber?"" by some random creep popping up in your chat was common and something you just routinely ignored. But after the ""AOL Incident"", my attitude about the internet was forever changed.  
I was staying with my cousin Jessie for a few weeks in summer in Calumet City, a suburb of Chicago. It was 1998 or '99. Me, 13 or 14, my cousin a year or so younger. Her bedroom was in their remodeled attic. We were sprawled out on the floor at her laptop past midnight, giggling and chatting away with her friends on AOL. Then, an unknown user with some ridiculous combination of demonic words plus a string of 6s IM'd her. It just said, ""666."" How original.  
She supposed it was one of her friends messing with her. She replied with something like, haha very funny, who is this? Justin?  
They didn't waste much time playing around. ""We know where you live, and we're coming for you.""  
We laughed it off, but also made sure her address wasn't posted in her profile. It wasn't. I assured her it was probably someone just having fun scaring some kids. A new IM popped up.  
""We're at Holy Cross Cemetery, about 5 minutes away now.""  
We squealed. Holy Cross *was* 5 minutes away from the house. We flew downstairs and made sure all of the doors were locked. We decided not to wake my aunt and uncle yet, because if it was a friend of hers playing a joke on us, they wouldn't be too happy about being woke up in the middle of the night. We made it back upstairs, locked her door, clicked off her light, and stationed ourselves in her window seat among a mountain of stuffed animals. We waited, peering out of the little triangle window to the street below. Not two minutes go by, and we see headlights parked up the road, but we can't see a vehicle. Then, the headlights moved forward, and a large black van came into view and parked two doors down from the house. Part of it felt like our imaginations were running wild, the other part like our worst nightmare was about to come true. The door slid open and two large bald-headed men in black clothing jumped out.   
""What are they doing?"" I asked frantically. Jessie was frozen, her eyes full to the brim with tears. ""Jessie, why are they looking at the trashcans? ...JESSIE!"" I shook her arm and she snapped out of it. ""...because the addresses are on them."" Just as she says this, we realize one of the men is on the sidewalk in front of us, holding her trashcan, looking at the house.  
We snapped into action. ""Send them an IM, tell them the police are almost here."" I ran through the upstairs, flicking on lights, hoping they would believe the whole house was awake. I started down the stairs toward the living room. I remembered there was a lightswitch panel for the living and dining rooms at the bottom of the stairs and was relieved because I was terrified to step foot down there. I flicked them and light flooded through the rooms downstairs. I heard voices from outside, muffled. Shouting. I ran back upstairs to Jessie's room and found her sitting in the window seat, sobbing.  
""He was walking toward the house when the downstairs lights went on. He yelled and another man ran from around the side of the house. They're gone.""  
We hugged and cried and didn't sleep that night. In the morning, my aunt wondered why the trashcan was on the sidewalk. We never told them, until last year, 13 years later. I guess we thought we wouldn't be able to use the internet anymore, and we were probably right. I still get chills up my spine when I hear those three traumatic words, ""you've got mail."""	t5_2t3t8	True
1375728976.0	1jr9pp	When I was little a crazed man wanted to come into my house	blackholebirthday	248	37	15	"So this is my first Reddit post ever because I felt encouraged to share this story with all of you and thought that you might appreciate it.

I grew up in a very small town in Massachusetts. My family's first home was a tiny two bedroom house but it was idyllic and really nice; it was on a corner lot next to a busy street but there was a huge yard and a big natural pond in the back yard that my mom admiringly recalls in stories she used to tell us about families of deer walking across it frozen over in the winter time to feed on tree boughs hanging over the water. Next to the pond was a totally expansive wooded area.

I still remember what happened because especially for my small mind to process at the time this was really terrifying to me then and according to my mother I had recurring nightmares about this, but even today it's still kind of disturbing. My father would leave for work every day early in the morning and a lot of times I would wake up with him, and subsequently my mother who would stay at home to take care of me would follow suit, so our days usually started very early. On one of these mornings my mom decided to take a shower before she did her other things typical of any day of the week. While she did that I played in the kitchen by myself on the floor. Our old kitchen was like a galley style and sort of narrow and at the end of the room directly ahead of me was our back door and a porch that my dad had built (which in retrospect was pretty high off of the ground because our house was built on a hill).

On this day I was playing and all of a sudden a man ran - ran as in dashed - onto the back porch and started banging at the door to be let in. We hadn't invited anyone over, not especially some man, and guests were pretty infrequent anyway but this was no ordinary man. He was literally pounding on the door, and through the window in the door I could see him staring at me on the floor and then he started begging me to let him in.

I just sat on the floor probably in mild shock and stared back at him. This man didn't even look away once to see if he could flag down help elsewhere like passing motorists on the busy street around the corner if he so desperately needed it. He was raising his voice and he was asking me to come to the door and let him inside. Asking a child, a very young child, to let a stranger inside. That's rule no. 1 that you don't break and every child in America is told to obey and luckily I had enough sense apparently to know this.

He might have realized this because I wasn't moving and then all of a sudden he started demanding that I open the door. He was yelling things like ""c'mon kid just let me in"", and at this point in my memory I believe I noticed he was wearing like a wig, a white electric looking wig because his hair was wild. And now he was absolutely pounding the door even harder and yelling and I distinctly remember him say something like ""don't get mommy"" or something like that because I had gotten off the floor and now I was banging on the bathroom door to get my mother. I told her that there was someone outside, and only dressed in just a towel she came out to see, and this is what gets me.

He jumps off of the back porch, like maybe a descent of like five feet because again my house sat on a hill and the porch was elevated off of that slope, and he runs - according to my mother - into the woods behind our house. Gone. My mother called the police I think but I do not remember if they ever found him; I guess that because I don't know that's probably indicative that they didn't because we never heard about it.

I wonder sometimes what would have happened if I had let him inside the house if he sincerely needed help. Like maybe he was being chased and he wasn't actually the threat; crime never happens in our town, ever, so it's hard to believe that that's the case. We were not friendly with our neighbors in any way and never knew if this man had also approached them asking for the same, but I will never forget this.

1370298552.0	1fm195	Serial killer in the making...	chizzle91	255	44	22	"I used to work in a sex shop. I know how that sounds. And while, yes, we sold porn and novelty toys and whatnot, we primarily sold lingerie and the store was obviously geared towards women.

It is important to note, that at this particular location, only one person was working at any given time. As in, on a dead night I was the only living soul in the building. I know now how stupid and dangerous it was to accept a job where there isn't even a coworker let alone a manager with you at all times, given we were all young females and closed at midnight. Even though we weren't supposed to carry any type of weapons, I always had a pocket knife. Brilliant right? I was too young to carry a gun, but there was a guy that worked next door that was super nice and always came to help if we needed him. Customers getting rowdy? Call him and boom he'd come running. He lived about a block from the store so I always felt better about that.

That being said, we would have ""creepers"" come in all the time, I kind of expected that when I got the job. Nobody really seemed dangerous however, just people constantly asking awkward questions. Again, I kind of expect that. However, about a month after I started working there, we started getting these weird phone calls every couple of weeks. A guy would call, say he had lost some sort of a bet, and had to do something ""humiliating."" Sometimes he had to mow his lawn in a pink bikini and high heels, sometimes he had to let a coworker tie him up on his desk and leave him there, etc etc. We assumed it was a prank caller and let it go at that. However after a certain amount of time, we began to notice he was only calling on my shift, and if anyone else answered, he would say he had the wrong number and hang up. (We knew it was him, he had a pretty distinct voice.) 
The calls gradually became more and more frequent, and he would ask more and more unusual things. He would ask me to describe certain lingerie down to what kind of stitching it had and everything. I started getting frustrated obviously and would start snapping at him, telling him it's the third time he's called that week, go somewhere else, whatever I felt like saying at the time.

Where I worked, even if we know it's a prank call, we're supposed to try to be the wonderful happy retail customer service providers that would make our bosses proud. So, I would start off the calls trying to be hopeful knowing damn good and well where it would end up. 

Anyway, one night he asked if we had a particular type of corset, which we did, and he said he would be by that night to look at it. I got creeped out and asked the guy that worked next door to come sit with me until closing, which he did. 

When I brought this up to my manager, she brushed it off. I asked if I could start working with a coworker but no, ""it wasn't in the budget."" Yeah, okay.

Moving on. The calls stopped. For about a week if I'm lucky. He began calling again saying he was going to come by sometime that night yadda yadda yadda. I started brushing them off as more of his prank calls. Until one night, we were dead, I was in the store by myself, and a guy walked in and said he had a strange question. My heart sank as soon as I heard him start talking. I immediately sat down behind the counter and refused to stand up and come out onto the floor. He said he had lost a bet, and had to ""parade around downtown dressed as a woman. Do we sell fake breasts?""

Great. I told him no, if it were closer to Halloween he could go to a costume store and could likely find foam breasts there, but the closest thing we could suggest would be to buy a bra and stuff it. Then he asked, as serious as can be, if I knew where he could buy breast tissue. In my head I'm thinking ""Umm...a fucking morgue?"" But told him that's more than I can help him with. He looked around the store for a minute and left. Once again, I called the guy from next door and he came and sat with me. 

The next time I worked, I sat by the panic button any time I wasn't helping a customer. Why I didn't walk out and say they don't pay me enough for this once he started going all Ed Gein on me I'll never know. Sure enough, he came back in once I was by myself. I hear the front door open, he comes running up to the counter, and asked if we sold ""honeymoon kits."" I pointed to the corner of the store where they would be and sat right back down. He slowly circled the room, pretending to look at the merchandise. I was watching him on the security cameras, and noticed every time he would walk past one of our storage doors, he would lean in and listen. Holy shit he's making sure I really am alone in here. When he got back around to the counter, he reached in his pocket, pulled out his cell phone, and pretended to start talking to somebody and ran back out the door. Now, he was close enough to the counter that I could hear everything. That phone never rang, and it didn't vibrate. Once I knew he was out of the store, I went to the front window to try and get a license plate number, because now I know this guy is whacked. He was already gone. It's hard to explain the layout of the store, but lets just say that for him to be gone by the time I got to the window, he had to have had his car running and waiting for him to come back out. However, I was able to see that it was a white SUV with round taillights. That's it.

Figuring this has gone beyond asking a friend for help, I called the local police department who said they would send an officer out to stay in the parking lot while I closed. As it turns out, the officer came out early to ask about the situation and he would come back at midnight. Between the phone call with the station and the time the officer came to the store, I noticed a white SUV crawl through the parking lot right up against the building. 

Officer comes and goes, and by the time he came back that night, the same SUV came through the parking lot FOUR MORE TIMES. However, since I couldn't see the guys face for sure, I didn't call the police. At the time I thought that was a huge no no, making calls when you're not sure, although later they assured me given the situation I should have called. Sounds stupid now.

Anyway, after that night, I turned in my two weeks notice and got a job elsewhere. Everything was fine for several weeks, actually a few months. Until one night I was in the car getting ready to go to dinner with my husband, when I get a phone call on my cell. I didn't recognize the number but I had recently gotten a new phone and wasn't sure if it was a deleted contact. So I answered and sure enough...it was him. 

Side note: I'm part of a website that offers ""spiritual counseling"" and whatnot. Don't ask just go with it....

He said he got my phone number from the website and wanted to know if I gave gender role counseling. I said I hadn't before but I'd give it a try and gave him the work email associated with that site, hoping he'd email me and I'd have more evidence to turn in to police. First of all, the site never had my phone number. Second of all, since I don't know where he got my number, I don't know if he knew my address, where I went to school, etc. Third of all, I'm now convinced this guy wanted to go all ""Buffalo Bill"" and wear my damn skin.

So, FINALLY I go to the police department, file a report, and give them the number. No clue what they did with it, but the calls stopped and I never saw the guy again. It's been a little over a year now and I don't even live in the same state anymore. Thankfully.

tl;dr - I was stalked by a wanna be Buffalo Bill."	t5_2t3t8	True
1349253746.0	10v7fw	It started off as a compliment..	waterlanding	249	37	62	"Okay, this is my first post on Reddit, so please bear with me. Sorry about formatting errors, or anything else.  My friend convinced me to post this on here, so here is my stalker story. 

I used to work at a local ice-cream/burger place in my small town. Everything was great, friendly people on lunch breaks, families, etc. Customers (usually older people,) would often talk to me, ask me things like my name, age, and whatever else. After a while, two men started coming in, one in his forties the other in his mid-twenties. They were always really nice and would leave me generous tips, they would call me the usual hun, sweetheart, beautiful, or any other compliment. It seemed harmless, and hey, they tipped well, so I was polite back. The only thing that struck me as odd was that the older man would always come in first and then as I walked up to him, he would get out his phone immediately and text someone.. then the younger man would walk in shortly. 
It got to the point where they would come in every time I was working, and my manager would joke about how they only came in to see me. I asked her more about it and apparently they never came on the days I didn't work. I got a little weirded out, I drive two different cars depending on what has more gas or what my mom hadn't taken. So, I stopped going upfront when I saw their car pull in, I'd stay in the back to make their food instead. 

One day, a newer girl was upfront and didn't know how to work the cash register, so I went up to help. They were there. I took their order and before I could run it back, the new girl ran back the order the other person that was working. I was left upfront and the younger man started talking to me. Asking my name, age, where I was going to school. I answered them all, not really seeing the harm, I mean my town is so small I didn't even think twice (I know, stupid.) After this, he asked me what types of sports I played in high school, I told him tennis. And he seemed overly interested. He then went on to tell me how he played tennis and would love to play against me sometime. I denied. He offered tickets to a tennis match, he'd pick me up. I denied, saying my boyfriend would be offended but thank you. He got really upset, like angry. He told me that I didn't have to lie and how he put himself out there just for me to stomp on his heart. He stormed out without his food, with his older friend behind him. 

They didn't come in for a couple of days, I was relieved. Later that week, I was at work and the new girl asked for help. I went up front and there they were. I rang them up and the new girl took back the order. I started making the younger one's ice cream cone. He tells me that he is sorry for blowing up on me and then goes on to tell me he has a racket signed by a famous tennis player. That I can have it if I want because it's a female racket (I didn't even know they made those,) and I can come over to his house and get it. Or maybe he could come pick me up, or wait for me after work and take me over. I decline, politely. Once again, he gets angry and leaves without his food or ice-cream. I wrote it off. 

The next day, I was closing with a boy a little younger than me. An hour before closing, a car pulls up. It just sits there, never turns off, no one comes in. Whoever it is, just sits in their car, pointed at the drive-through. I was slightly unnerved but didn't really take it too seriously. Anyhow, me and the kid close up and we're getting ready to leave. And he starts walking a different direction. As I pass the car, I look into the window and there sits the younger man.. Which is weird because it was a yellow car, rather than his beat up red one he usually drives. I hear it move, the head lights turn on me. At this point, the kid I closed with, runs back to me and walks to my car. I give him a ride home. The car follows me. It waits at the parking lot of the trailer park, I leave the park, it follows. It followed me until a cop drives by and then it immediately turns a different direction.
I quit my job there, for multiple reasons, and I didn't see him for a month. Some weeks ago, I was walking at my college (a little community one,) and I see him. Standing there, staring, smiling that creepy smile. He waves, and I look away. The next week after my night class that ends at ten, he is waiting in the lobby. He says hi, and asks if I remember him. I told him to not talk to me, and quickly start walking away. He gets up to follow. A guy from my class saw this and caught up to me and walked me to my car. Then last week, I got followed home from college. I didn't notice it until whoever got in the lane to pass me, as I turned off to my exit, they switched lanes and followed. They followed me at an unusual distance. I shrugged it off. 

I got back into town where I basically ran a red light because I didn't want them to be close to me. They turned down an alley before the light. I get to my house, park my car, get out, and what do I see? The same car, a beat up red car, slowed almost to a stop. I see the silhouette of the man in the car look in his rear-view mirror. A car comes up behind him and he turns into down an alley two house down. I get in my house and lock the doors. I then look outside my kitchen window (I live on an alley) to see the same car, with the younger man in it, driving down my alley.


I'm so scared, I don't know what to do. I have no proof, besides me getting random phone calls recently that for some reason, I cannot call back. I just don't know what to do. If I see him again, I think I'll call the cops. Or would that be overreacting? Could it be that he happens to go to my college too? Or did he go there because I told him that's where I was attending this fall. I am so paranoid because of all this, I never thought this would happen in a small town. 






UPDATE: As of 10/09 I thought I saw him outside my college last night but it was too dark to tell. Also last night I heard someone banging on my back door around one or two in the morning, my mom wasn't home and it really freaked me out. When I told her about it, she just shrugged it off, she really doesn't take this whole thing seriously. I think I've been seeing him around town but I could just be going crazy from the paranoia. Thanks for all your advice and what not."	t5_2t3t8	True
1348468650.0	10drsp	Morgan	this_isnt_happening	240	27	91	"This is a collection of stories about my older brother, Morgan. Morgan is a psychopath. I don't know why it hadn't occurred to me to tell these stories here earlier- I suppose I thought it wouldn't quite fit as a ""creepy stranger"" story since I know him, but I suppose the term ""let's not meet"" will be used by you guys against him once you've heard this. 

First off, he molested my little brother and I. I debated whether to even mention this since it might overshadow the other things he did, but it would be too weird not to mention it. In any case, I can't remember how old I was when he started- basically these episodes intertwine with some of my first memories. It went on about once a week until I was about 11 or 12, around the same time I hit puberty. He apparently doesn't care for girls who have ""developed"". Ew. 

As for my little brother, it is also a mystery when that started, but it stopped a few years before Morgan stopped with me. They shared a room, though, so I can only imagine how often it happened with him. 

For a time, Morgan would make my little brother and I do things together. After Morgan quit with both of us, he would occasionally proposition us or go on and on about videos he wanted to make with us and a couple of his friends, but by then we were better able to put our foot down.

My dad didn't know until we were all well in to adulthood. My mom caught Morgan and I once and punished him, but after that she thought it was over with. Unbeknownst to her it started up a week later when he explained that mom had encouraged him to keep it up (she had not, of course). 

He was extremely manipulative, but also physically imposing. He was always quite tall, and thin but sinewy. We had a real fear of him, because he didn't seem to care whether he hurt anyone else.

For instance, he and I were waiting in the car at the grocery store and he was directly in front of me in the passenger seat. He suddenly ""adjusted"" his seat by sliding it all the way back and pinning my legs. I shook his seat and pushed at him, telling him to move it back, at which point he grabbed my hand hard- and broke it. I needed a cast going up to my elbow to keep my hand in place. I was 14, he was 17. Around that same time there were a number of violent incidents. Mostly throwing things at me, like logs from the fireplace or furniture. One time, he grabbed a machete from the fireplace (dad used it to chop wood) and chased me around the house. I used a stepladder to defend myself, which he hacked away at over and over. When I was able to get inside my room and lock the door, he hacked away at that, too, before losing interest. 

He wet the bed, at least in to his teens. That may not seem relevant, but many sources say it's one of the early indicators of a future serial killer.

Another indicator is animal torture, and he's done plenty of that. One time, when one of our dogs had puppies, he took those puppies and dropped them off the second level of the barn. He did this in front of my little brother and I, and we were luckily able to catch them. The reason he was doing it was to upset us- I don't remember why, but I know it worked, because we were both screaming and crying and begging him to stop. 

Another time, he and a friend collected field mice in a large, empty aquarium. There were maybe a hundred of them, all squirming around in a thick layer on the bottom of the tank, about half of them babies.

He just kept them. Tossed a few to the dogs, but mostly just kept them and watched what they would do when they got hungry. The babies went first, of course.

He managed to hit more than your average number of dogs once he could drive. One was a puppy who survived, but with a strange, prancing gait. Morgan and his friends later fed this dog copious quantities of alcohol, after which she developed alcohol poisoning and was gravely ill for about a week. I took care of her, though my dad kept telling me I should just put her out of her misery. When it was over, she survived, but severely brain damaged. 

When he was 17 or 18, he ""ran away"". Unfortunately, he hadn't *really* run away, and was hiding in a nearby field and raiding our house for supplies during the day. My dad decided to barricade the house, but that would require one of us to stay home so we could put the boards in place.

I went first, so it was a day off and I was holed up in the house with 2x4s wedged in under all the doorknobs. Morgan showed up around noon. He banged on all the doors and screamed to be let inside. He spotted me through the windows in the living room and focused his attention there, screaming and jumping up to bang on them (they were about 6 feet up from ground level). Then he disappeared for a few tense moments and then returned. He had a dead bird in his hand. I had buried the poor thing a few days earlier when it crashed during a storm and broke its neck. I guess he saw the freshly turned dirt and made a lucky guess. he proceeded to throw the bird at the window over and over again until it disintegrated. 

I've thought of all these things off the top of my head, and of course in no particular order. I've been meaning to type it up for a few days now and decided to bite the bullet, but now it's getting late and I would rather not think about him *right* before I go to bed- he's popped up in a lot of nightmares over the years. Sorry about the messy narrative, I hope it's still readable, and let me know if you want to know more- this is far from all the stories, of course. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1344620665.0	y092m	Why I'll Never Hitch Again	FreakyDarling85	244	30	18	"So, some necessary background. I live in a very tight knit rural community. Everybody knows everybody for the most part. But my family isn't originally from here, we moved to the area when I was ten to care for my ailing great-grandfather. My parents were originally from larger cities and also had a good deal of world experience from their service in the Marine Corps. I feel this explains why they raised me with the knowledge that it's not the world's responsibility to make sure nothing bad happens to me. This has led to a mild paranoia when I encounter people I don't know. But when I was a teenager, something happened that justified it for me.

About ten years ago, I was taking my now husband home to his father's house. Important facts: his father's house was a good thirty minute drive from my own home, and a fifteen minute stretch of it is on an unlit country road surrounded by nothing but cornfields. So I drop off my now husband and start my drive home at around eleven at night. Well as luck would have it, my piece of shit car broke down almost directly in the middle of this unlit stretch of cornfield. And at this point in my life, cell phones were still very pricey and my parents had deemed one unnecessary.

So there I was next to a cornfield, with absolutely no light, about a five to eight mile walk from the nearest establishment, a bar on the corner where the country road meets the main one. So rather than risking a run in with coyotes, I was ready to sleep in my car until either daylight or my parents came looking. But then a car pulled up.

It was a rusted out, old Chevy Caprice, driven by a bearded, overweight man I had never seen before who was wearing overalls but no shirt. Which struck me as kind of creepy but not out of the ordinary for the area. He asked me if I needed a ride and against my better judgement I agreed and told him I only needed to go to the bar. 

Things really took a turn for the creepy when he started driving. He told me he could take me home because he knew where I lived. I just want to reiterate that I had never even seen, let alone met this man before. He then goes on to tell me stuff about myself, like I have three dogs and what time I hung out laundry on the clothesline two days earlier. How could this man know these things? I had very few neighbors and I knew them all as well as their families!

I politely told him the bar would be fine, completely convinced I was going to become a cautionary tale at this point. But he kept telling me things about me and things I did whenever I was in my yard. 

Finally, we reached the stop sign in front of the bar. The car was still moving when I jumped from the car, yelling a thanks over my shoulder as I ran into the bar. Luckily the bartender was an acquaintance of my parents, so she set me up with a soda while she called my mother. I never saw the man or the rusted out Caprice again.

But I finally convinced my mom that a cell phone was a necessity, even if it was just a crappy prepaid one. Because under no circumstances would I ever hitch a ride again."	t5_2t3t8	True
1374088448.0	1ii7di	Every breath you take...	thenightbattles	253	44	29	"This happened to me during my first year of university, in October. I was living in the dorms and I need to give you a brief run-down of the dorms- you need a keycard to gain access to your specific floor, so even though someone on the 3rd floor and 4th floor live in the same building, they can't access each other's floors.

I had injured myself playing sports, so I was under orders to 'rest', which meant no Hallowe'en parties for me. Pretty sad for a horror fiend like myself, but to try and make the time a happy one, I busied myself helping to make costumes for people and doing their makeup. Once I was finally finished, I packed up my makeup and decided to watch some movies in my room. A guy popped up and introduced himself, we chatted a bit and exchanged email addresses and I walked back to my room and said goodnight. The first warning sign was that he walked into my room behind me, despite me saying I was going to walk into my room. I felt really awkward and tried to say, in a roundabout way that he needed to leave. But he wasn't getting the hint. I finally had to say ""you need to leave my room now"". I chalked this up to him maybe being drunk or something, but I did wonder how he got onto my floor if he wasn't with anyone partying. Before I went to bed that night, I checked my email and there were 5 from Creep. The first being ""hey I'm so glad we're friends"" and the rest asking why I wasn't online.

A few days later, I got a knock on my door when I was studying and it was him. I explained that I was studying and needed privacy. He tried to walk into my room again, but I braced my arm on the frame and said firmly that I needed to study. The next day, he was at my door again and the next. I began pretending that I was not home. Another day there was a knock at the door and when I checked the peephole, there was no one there and I assumed the postman had come. I opened the door and lo and behold, it was the creepy guy. He has begun hiding from the peephole so I would be more likely to answer the door. I told my roommate never to open the door if he was there and I told the people living on my floor that this guy was beginning to creep me out, so if he wanted to get on the floor, whatever sob story he gave them, don't let him on.

A few days after that, I was on the bus coming home and I got a text from someone who lived on my floor telling me not to come home because Creep was on my floor and was sitting in front of my door, just waiting. I went to a friend's house and spent the night and when I got home, I was told he waited for FOUR HOURS before leaving. At this point, I was getting freaked out. A few days after that, he began waiting outside the building and if I left, he would follow me wherever I went. I was too spineless to tell him to go away and I tried to be more passive about it. I never spoke, and never gave any indication I was paying attention but he followed me to class, the cafeteria and always tried to follow me home and get access to the floor.

I went to the Resident Advisor (an older student that sort of 'watches over' the floor) and told her what happened. She spoke to the RA for his floor and was told that Creep had been telling his own RA that we were best friends and dating. My RA tried to explain that I was uncomfortable, but the other RA believed him and that was that. Thankfully, one thing did deter him, he would never approach me if I was with a group of people, so my floor-mates banded together. If I went to dinner, I went with my floor and if I wanted a drink, or seconds, someone had to come with me. Walking to class and even waiting for the bus was done in a group. He got onto my floor once when someone else was coming home and he forced his foot in the door to let himself in. I was 'hidden' in another room and when he left my door to go and sit in the television lounge to wait for me- I went downstairs and ran around to the other side of the building and got into my room before he noticed.

Then the phone calls began. I never gave him my number, but he somehow obtained my mobile and room phone and at first it would be 1-2 phone calls a day until I told him I wanted him to leave me alone. Then the calls began coming in every hour with him begging and pleading for me to talk to him. Without caller ID, I needed to answer the phone because of school and my part time job.

At this point it was November and I was a wreck. I was tired of having to plan out doing simple things like going for food or walking to a bus stop. Stress wasn't helping me recover from my injury and I was losing weight and I just looked... sickly. I went back to the RA and begged her to help me. She went to the head of the dorms and explained everything that happened. I explained how far this had gone and my roommate told them that he had followed her a few times, demanding that she tell him where I was. I felt awful. She never told me this because she was afraid of upsetting me further and I felt like I was an asshole for putting her through this garbage. 

I don't know what went on behind closed doors, from what I guess, he was told to leave me alone and any further contact would result in him being kicked out of the dorms. There was one email where he went insane on me, telling me how awful I was, how could I do this to him? We were so happy together! Surely I was cheating on him with other men. After that, nothing.

At first, when I'd see him around campus, I would run to the women's toilets to hide. I'd see him around town or on campus and he'd always just stare at me. Never tried to approach me, never tried to get my attention. Just staring. I used to walk by and try to pretend I didn't notice him staring and I'd try and act like my heart wasn't pounding."	t5_2t3t8	True
1356323073.0	15cwth	Walk-in Closet		259	50	41	"Just found this subreddit... and holy shit do I have the perfect story.

This happened a few years ago when I graduated college and took my first real job in the city. I had moved back in with my parents after college and the daily commute into the city was really wearing on me. I was finally getting paid enough to live by myself, and wanted a place that was close to the 'hip' neighborhoods but still within my price range and not hood. Safe. Adjacent. Cheap. After searching for a while I felt like it was a game of ""pick two"", but then I happened upon a small community managed by a pretty reputable company.

It was gated and nestled between two residential neighborhoods, surrounded by trees (seemed *very* safe by Atlanta standards) and seemed to meet all of my criteria. The rent wasn't quite where I wanted, but I figured I could live with it because I was exhausted. As the leasing agent showed me around, I understood why they were charging less for this place. The buildings definitely had some age on them. It looked like they were built in the 60's. I remember being shown the unit and thinking it was kind of drab.

The thing that really stuck out the first time I saw my soon to be bedroom was the large square ""door"" on the side of the room facing the outside. The leasing agent described it as a ""walk-in closet"" which I found to be a little too kind a description. The opening was small because it had to accomodate a sloped ceiling ([example](http://i-cdn.apartmenttherapy.com/uimages/ny/12-19-sloped-ceiling-1.jpg) to give you an idea of how much horizontal wall space there was.) You definitely had to crouch a lot (or crawl) to get in there, but once inside it opened up a bit. I made a dumb joke about Being John Malkovich that the agent didn't understand. Honestly though, I was a single guy and didn't have much stuff so I didn't care. I signed a lease (the longest term they offered, because fuck moving) and moved in.

As I suspected it would, the closet remained empty after the move. I was able to fit my clothing in a dresser. I'm a programmer and my job lets me wear whatever I want, so I don't exactly keep suits on hand or anything like that. The first time I opened the thing up was after I moved in because the internet guy was looking around for jacks. When I opened it up though, I smelled something faint. I thought it smelled like weed, but I couldn't quite place it. I chalked it up to musk and/or insulation.

As the weeks rolled on my curiosity about the closet piqued a little bit. Every person that I brought over found it to be a really interesting feature of the apartment. One day when I woke up after a late night drinking, I saw the door to the closet was slightly ajar. The handle was pretty old and I figured it must have come loose. When you live in an old building you get used to that kind of thing. Some creaks and groans along with the normal noise from the neighbors. Sometimes though when I was in bed or around the apartment, I would hear stuff that I thought sounded a little odd. Footsteps that sounded oddly placed based on my knowledge of the building layout. Nothing too weird though.

When I was out on my patio one day (my apartment faced the woods surrounding the complex) I noticed that the gate that I thought surrounded the entire property stopped when the woods got too dense, about 40 feet from my apartment. It didn't look like anybody could possibly get through unscathed, but it still set me on edge. It was if my subconscious was piecing things together that didn't seem quite right and tugging at the edges of my conscious mind. I used to lock my bedroom door when I went to sleep at night, as a precaution in case of home invasion. I started to leave it open. I kind of chalked it up as something silly, like running up the stairs after turning the lights out in a basement. Still though, before I went to sleep every night I would think about the little square door a few feet from my bed that had all that space... no amount of logical reasoning would set me at ease. The idea of opening the closet filled me with a sense of dread, that I refused to acknowledge because it seemed so childish.

Eventually enough was enough. I decided the door was going off it's hinges and I was installing a night light. I waited until broad daylight to muster up the courage to open the closet. Even then, I took a knife from the kitchen and held it to my side just in case. When I opened the closet, it was completely empty. My eye caught something in the corner, almost pushed into the carpet was a red mini Bic Lighter.

I. flipped. the. fuck. out.

There was no way that was there before. I broke my lease the same day and went to stay at a hotel. I tried filing a police report but they said there wasn't enough evidence and the management wouldn't let me out of my lease without paying all the fines. I didn't care. There was no way I was spending another second in that apartment. I even hired movers to come and haul my shit. To this day it still freaks me out a little bit, because there was no big reveal that justified my freak out. When I think about somebody crawling in and out of that closet while I'm asleep it sets the hairs of my neck on end."	t5_2t3t8	True
1343645703.0	xdwdy	Burning Recliner and Dead Cow	ornery4days	244	35	26	"Hey guys; new here so be gentle. I actually have several stories to share if you're interested, all true and all creepy. I'll start with this particular story because it haunts me to this day, over 20 years after it happened. 

I was about 21 or 22 when this happened. I was in the military at Ft. Sill and didn't know it, but Desert Storm was right around the corner. At the time, I lived in south central Oklahoma on the outskirts of a small town called Duncan. I was helping a friend round up some cattle that got out because someone had run across a T-section and went through their fence. It tore two posts down and left a 30 foot section open for the cattle to get out. 

We'd already found most of the cattle and were missing another 3 or 4 so we were out at 1am on dirt bikes trying to find them before someone hit one of them and sued his father. My friend and I went east and the other guys went north and south. 

One thing you need to understand about Oklahoma is that most of it farmed; either cattle or crops. It is also divided into one mile sections for the most part. In other words, the roads all run north and south or east and west and intersect at one mile intervals. If you ask directions for something out in the country, you are more likely than not to get instructions that include ""go three mile sections north and then two mile sections west."" The area at this time was sparse and there weren't many homes. 

We didn't know how long the hole had been in the fence. My friends' father only checked the fence because he was missing livestock. They owned the entire mile section and a good portion of the adjoining mile section. The hole in the fence was on the east side of their land, at the furthest distance from their house. They check the fence for such holes on a weekly basis, so the hole could not have been more than two days old. 

James and I were riding on these old dusty, dirt roads with battery powered spot lights to both show the way and to search for cattle. We'd stop at any of the million small wooden bridges and look to see if there were any cows down by the water. Our plan was to go out ten miles and then go over a mile section and drive back ten miles until we'd gone a total of ten miles out and ten miles over. Then we were to do it all again but on the North/South roads instead of the East/West roads. If you were to plot it a map, it would be a ten by ten grid. 

We had been at it since before 9pm, just as it was getting dark and we'd already gone ten miles out and about three miles over. I need to mention at this point there there are some mile sections that are not divided by roads and you have to turn one way or another at a T-intersection. If that happens, we always took the road that went in our general direction of travel. If we were traveling East and came to a T, and we'd already checked the road North of us, then we'd head to the South a mile and then head East again. 

Occasionally, an old farmer would pass away and leave his land to relatives who had no interest in farming and the land would be put up for sale or just left alone for years. When this happens and the roads aren't used as much, nature reclaims them and you're usually left with a dirt road with weeds and grass growing on it or you're left with little more than an improved trail; usually two ruts with overgrown weeds and johnson grass and occasionally a tree. 

We were on one of the rutted roads, headed south to the next intersection where we'd turn east again. The land here was too hilly for cultivation and had been left alone for at east the last thirty years. We were both familiar with it and we hunted and fished there. This mile section and the next two were basically wild. At the end of the dirt trail would be a T intersection, but the west side was fenced and the only option was to turn east again. At the end of this mile section, the road was a dead end, but we had to check it and the double back. 

We'd just made the turn back to the east when we saw something burning over the next rise. Grass fires are extremely dangerous and can get out of control in minutes. As we topped the rise, we saw the the fire was actually in the middle of the dirt road. When we got to it, we found that it was a recliner that was burning. A blue lazyboy recliner. We stopped and threw some dirt on it and finally got it extinguished. James and I was wondering what kind of an idiot would do this and how strange it was to be in the middle of the road just burning. 

Satisfied that the fire was out, we got back on our bikes and idled past the recliner toward the end of the mile section, still a quarter  of a mile in the distance. We found one of their cows at the bottom of the rise, about 100 feet down the road. It was laying in half in and half out of the road. It's throat had been cut and it was laying there with its eyes opened and tongue hanging out. There was blood everywhere. As we were looking at it and trying to figure out what happened, James said ""Hey, look at this!"" and showed me where the blood had dripped from the cow to about ten feet away from it. There were shoe prints of blood in the road. It was just part of a shoe print, but you could tell that was a shoe print. We found two more when we looked more diligently. 

At this point, the hairs on the back of my neck were standing up and it was suddenly a very cool evening. I looked at James and his eyes were as big as saucers. He thought something spooky was happening too. 

We talked about going back, but we knew that we'd be shamed if we didn't see if there was anything else. We finally decided to walk the bikes the rest of the way to the dead end just in case there was someone there. We didn't want them to hear the engines. 

We began walking the last quarter mile or so to the dead end. It was at the base of the last hill and we'd just starting heading up it on the other side. My heart was going about 200 miles an hour and I had cotton mouth so bad that it was almost impossible to swallow. Then I noticed that someone had stuck paper plates to the barbs of the wire of the fence. We looked and there were plates stuck to the top strand of wire on both sides of the rode. It started about 50 feet behind us and continued up and over the hill. They were evenly spaced about 5 feet apart. As our gaze followed the row of paper plates up the the top of the hill, James suddenly said ""there's another fire"" and it was at that moment that I could smell it. But what I smelled wasn't that normal smoky smell, it was as though someone had added incense to it. I asked James if he could smell that and he could. 

I told him that I didn't like this at all. I was OK with losing face in front of our friends and his dad and brothers. I was ready to go. He agreed with me but said that we had to see what was burning. We were both whispering and we were both shaking so much that our voices quavered. 

We started up the hill again and I was thinking with every step that we were going to be seriously killed or worse. As we got to the top of the hill, one of the paper plates blew off the fence and skittered behind us, making both of jump and it was all I could do not to scream. After we saw what it was, I started to laugh it off, but James shushed me and told me to listen. We could hear voices. 

As we topped the hill and were able to see the bottom where the road stopped, we saw a group of about ten people all standing around another recliner that was burning. They had their backs to us and they were passing a big pitcher around. From our vantage point, we couldn't actually see what was in the pitcher, but the slit throat of the cow haunted my thoughts. They would each take a mouthful and spit it into the fire. This went on until the pitcher was empty. The entire time, they were all saying something in unison. We could only understand an occasional word. They changed their tones in a rhythmic manner with an emphasis on the last word. I can remember hearing ""here and there"" and ""beseech"" and ""Father.""

James and I stood there on top of that hill like a couple of idiots. Our mouths hanging wide open and actually scared stiff. After a minute or two, they would repeat whatever it was, all the while passing that pitcher and spitting into the fire. There was a small camp table set up on the side and little behind them. After the last of the liquid was gone, a man turned and sat the pitcher on the table and picked up what looked like a large loaf of bread. Just as he was turning back to the fire, he evidently saw us. I am sure that we made a nice silhouette sitting there at the top of the hill. He screamed ""hey"" and dropped the loaf of bread and started running in our direction. The others turned and immediately followed him. 

That was all the encouragement that we needed. It was time to go. We turned our bikes around. James got his started on the first kick, but I somehow managed to get myself off balance and when I kicked, the bike fell on its side with me. By this time I was near panic and was breathing in raspy short breaths. I picked the bike up again and tried to start it, but it didn't start. I thought about running, but we were out in the middle of nowhere. I finally started pushing the motorcycle down the other side of the hill and jumped on it. It seemed like it took forever to get enough speed but I popped the clutch and it started. James was waiting at the corner of the intersection to make sure that I was coming and we headed for his house, going way too fast for safety, especially in the dark. 

When we finally got back to his house, we told his dad what we'd seen. His dad called a couple friends and they all loaded up in their trucks with enough weapons to start a small war. James and I sat with his dad and told him were to turn. His dad kept asking us questions on the way. What were they doing. Why was there a chair on fire? They cut the cow's throat? How many were there? What did they look like? What were they driving? 

That last question stumped us. We hadn't seen any cars or trucks. The road was the only way in or out and there was a creek that ran on the back side of the end of that particular road so they couldn't have gone that direction. How had they gotten there with two recliners? 

When we got to that last stretch of road, the headlights found the spot where the recliner had been sitting. It was gone. We could all see where the road and surrounding grass was burned, but the recliner was not there. As we got closer, James noticed that the cow was gone too. I hate to admit, but I was getting scared all over again. I was afraid that his dad would tell us that it was our imagination and not believe us. 

When we got closer to the burnt spot in the road, Buster (James' dad) noticed the chair off in the ditch on the left side of the road. Then I noticed the cow on the other side; it was also in the ditch. The paper plates were all gone. Buster got out to look at the cow with the other men. They stood there talking and shaking their heads for what seemed like ten minutes before getting back into the trucks. 

We continued toward the hill. The ruts made by spinning motorcycle tires were easily seen but there was no fire on the other side of the hill. We all went down to where the other recliner had been burning, but it and the camp table were gone. You could see where someone had walked around the charred area and covered it with dirt. After we left, James saw a paper plate about 50 feet on the other side of the fence. 

Buster called the county sheriff when we got home and by that time it was daylight and we went out again with the sheriff and a deputy. When we got back to the road, the first recliner and the cow were gone, but you could still see where something had been on fire and there was still blood on the road and in the grass. James showed them the shoe prints we'd seen. 

At the bottom of the hill, you could still see the charred area where the second recliner had been burning and the deputy found little scuff marks where the table had been sitting. At the end of the road, you could see where the top strand of the fence had been tugged down and wrapped around the lower strand so someone could crawl over it. You could also see where the grass and weeds had been trampled, providing a fairly easy trail to follow. We found a woman's tennis shoe on the other side of the creek. You could see where someone had climbed up the bank on the far side of the creek. We followed the trail all the way across the field up to the next dirt road. Again, the top wire was wrapped around the next lower wire and there was a piece of red bandanna looking material caught in it. There were marks on the road where two or three different cars had spun their tires when they left. Buster also found a large piece of glass that had blood on it. 

Buster filed a report for the missing cow. They'd found four more cows in the opposite direction from where me and James had gone. They never found the recliners or the missing cow. The sheriff called a few days later and told Buster that the blood on the glass was human and not bovine. It was his guess that the pitcher broke and someone cut their hand while carrying it back to their vehicles. Two weeks after that, there was a huge scare in our community about some cult that had promised the area at large that they were going to sacrifice a blonde haired virgin girl and boy. Buster always said that it was just someone running their mouth after hearing about our incident. It was all anyone talked about that summer. Buster also said that he sure like to know what happened to that cow. 

Sorry it was so long. I got chill bumps while remember all of this. This happened in 1988-89 and I still think about it.  Tell me if you want to read some of the other creepers I have... "	t5_2t3t8	True
1364947120.0	1bjw2b	The Broken Doorknob	datalexnew	249	39	21	"Hey all, thought I'd share a creepy tale that still sort of bugs me to this day.

A few years back, my family and my neighbors' family went on a vacation to Nags Head, North Carolina. We had a rental house and it was up on stilts to deter flood water, so you had to walk up this long set of stairs to get to the door.

Anyway, on the first floor of the house was a long hallway. At one end were my neighbors and their young children. At the other end was me and my sister's room, next to the door to the outside.

One important part of this story is the doorknob to my and my sister's room was broken. You had to turn it all the way and then employ a little bit of extra force and it would ""pop"" and twist a bit more, opening the door. So to the uninitiated, it seemed like the door may have been locked when it was actually unlocked.

So one night, it's about 11:30pm and everyone's asleep except me and my sister. I'm probably 11 at the time and she's about 12. So we're up just hanging out, playing Gameboy and whatnot.

All of the sudden, the doorknob starts wildly shaking. Someone was trying to open the door, but really frantically. The sound made us jump, so we asked who it was. Nobody answered and the doorknob kept jiggling. We called again, this time we were both a little worried. No answer. The doorknob is being shaken like crazy. Someone was really trying to get in.

We were really freaked out, so we started screaming. Asking who it was with no answer, just the door trying to the opened. Now, everyone in the house was aware of our doorknob being like this. They would've had no trouble getting in. And if they heard us screaming, they would've said who it was right away.

My sister and I kept yelling for what seemed like a long time, but was probably only a minute or so. The doorknob stopped shaking after about 15 seconds of this and maybe thirty seconds later, we heard a voice from outside of the door. It was our neighbor asking what was wrong. We opened the door and, in frightened tears, told them what happened. 

We checked to see if it was our neighbor's kids, but they were fast asleep. Our parents came downstairs to see what the yelling was about, too. So it hadn't been them.

The door in the hallway next to our room that connected to the outside was unlocked.

I'm convinced someone was in our house that night. They came up that long staircase and into the house. Who it was, I'll never know. But they tried, frantically, to get into a room with screaming kids in it. Thank god for that broken knob."	t5_2t3t8	True

We have gone there several times in the past since it was usually low priced and a nice way to get away from our cold Canadian winters.We were staying at an all inclusive resort near the ocean. This resort had a lot of things to do during the night like shows and what not

3 days into our trip my family went to go see a show. We were all having a fun time until I started to get a really bad headache and my parents noticed this telling me that i should lie down in our room. I agreed and they handed me a keycard, as i was walking into the elevator a tall Hispanic man walked in with me. He was wearing what seemed to be a dirty jacked and ripped jeans he also had a big black beard that was uncombed and just really frizzy. I pushed my button to the 7th floor and he just stood still leading me to think his room was there too. He then started asking me questions like how old are you? and how long i was staying there. I answered normally but then he asked wheres the rest of your family? (my answer was one of the worst things i have ever done in my life)I responded with ""watching the show downstairs"". As i got off he started following me down the hallway which i started sweating and freaking out. As i was approaching my room i kind of squeaked and asked ""where are you going?"" and he said back ""to my room"". Now shaking as i put the key card in the door lock. He seemed to be turned around facing the other room across from me. As soon as the door opened he turned and charged at me and because i was looking back i saw him and ran in the room, i tried shutting the door but he got to it first. now it was me and him alone in the hotel room, He had what looked to be a knife or shank he was slowly walking towards me and said ""be quiet or ill kill you"". As i was at the back of the room and he was getting closer i threw the lamp at him and rushed to get around him and out of the room. he cut my arm pretty deep but i was sprinting out of the room to the stairwell. As i got to the lobby I ran to my family crying  and screaming help. 

After that i got stitches on my arm and i my mom still doesn't forgive herself for not coming with me to the room. The hotel offered us an upgrade to the a nice suite  and we took it but were very paranoid for the rest of the trip. We later found out it was a homeless man that just came through the doors of the hotel. He stole my laptop and my backpack which were in the open and then fled to the lobby out the doors."	t5_2t3t8	True

I don't know whether to laugh or cry at this but I was walking home alone from a party, it was maybe about 2 AM already and the streets were deserted but well lit, thank god. About maybe two streets to my house I hear a shuffling sound from behind me and before I could react and turn around this random woman comes at me and whispers 'im so wet right now' right on my ear.

What the fuck, lady? I was so taken aback but all I could say was 'good for yah.' and tried to continue on my jolly way, but then she followed me and said '10 bucks i'll make you feel good' i looked at her straight in the eye, which was so fucking red btw, and said 'i don't have a penis' and then ran the fuck away from her.

I got home unscathed, and decided to just sleep it off. Fuck showering. I was lying pretty comfortably on my bed when I hear this 'pssst' sound from out my window. Heads up, my house is a bungalow and I live here alone, my bed is right beside my window. Naturally, I got scared and got the fuck out my bed whilst trying to dial 911. And then I heard 'hey.hey.can i come inside and pee please.' 

That fucking lady followed me home. I shouted 'what?!' realizing I've had enough of this I phoned 911 and said that there's a crazy hooker right outside my window and that they need to contain her ASAP.
They came and contained her and she was reasoning out that all she wanted was to pee. 

I got up close to her and tried to talk her out of her chosen profession but she was evidently high on some drug and I figured not to bother anymore. And the cops took her.

Needless to say, I slept pretty uncomfortably that night.

1340263996.0	vdf9t	I actually feel really guilty (sad story)	SennaWales	235	28	15	"I'm going to start off with some back story, but it is really important. My friend John's parents were the type of parents that every kid loves. Sherry was 8 when she met Dan, and he was 10. They were never apart after that. They had the kind of marriage other people dream of, and they were so nice too! Dan worked hard and Sherry was a devoted Christian wife who loved everyone. I cannot tell you how welcome they made me feel. Both of them were very old south, beans and taters for dinner, milk to drink, and great stories to go with it. They would give you anything you asked for and never think twice about it. 

They had four children, David, Jan, Wayne, and my friend John. John was the surprise child because the others were at least 20 years older than him. John is one of the best people I have ever met in my life, I cannot stress enough just how ALMOST perfect their lives were.

I hate to say that I was ""lucky."" I feel like it makes me a terrible person.

John's older brother Wayne had schizophrenia. When he was on his medication he was fine. When he wasn't he was standing in the yard naked, screaming angrily. 

Needless to say, I was terrified of Wayne.

I moved away, and so did John, for college. Two years ago we both happened to be in town at the same time and decided to spend time together, after hanging out we decided that John would come back to my town with me (where more of our friends were) and hang out for the weekend. While he was in my car he asked if I wanted to go by his house and stay with his parents. Now, I'm not going to say that I got some weird feeling telling me not to, or that the cosmos opened and gave me a warning. I simply said ""actually I'm really tired and it's a two hour drive, I think I'd rather just get on the road."" It WAS in fact a weird thing to say, since I've time to think about it. I love John parents! There was absolutely no reason NOT to stop, their house was even on the way out of town. But I felt tired and just didn't want to.

The next morning John came out of my bedroom (I slept on the couch, trying to be a good host) and told me he needed to go home. Not thinking anything of it, I rolled over and went back to sleep. 

Two hours later John texts me and tells me something that both scared me and crushed me.

John's brother Wayne had come into his parent's house that morning and had beaten his mother to death with a baseball bat, in John's bedroom.

 She had tried to call John's father and brother.. but they were too late, and once they arrived Wayne tried to kill them too. 

Sometimes I feel guilty that we didn't at least stop in and say hello, and sometimes I feel guilty thinking that maybe with three of us there we could have saved her life.But I'm not sure my 90lbs body could've stopped a crazy man with a baseball bat, bent on murder.

Especially when he had intended to kill the entire family, but only his mother was home. "	t5_2t3t8	True

I work events (you know posh do's where you see staff walking around with trays of champagne; well I'm the girl with the tray). Usually it's an easy fun way to make money. My job most of the time is to make sure no-ones glass is empty so naturally in that role you become pretty popular.

Another thing to mention is that I tend to be the only girl on shift when it gets late, I'm talking 00:00 to 04:00. This is because of the equal opportunities act legally having to at least on girl working. Seeing as most of the girls I work with are incapable of lifting anything without bitching about a broken nail I am the one that's kept on till the end.

So it's a normal night at work for me an awards evening or something like that for all the rich successful suits and ties to bask in their own glory. 

So I'm going round topping up drinks smiling away. Partaking in the usual small talk about the wine or how nice the venue is. But there are these two guys standing alone that wave me over. One guy asked something like 'What's a girl like you working a job like this?' I joking say 'Well someone has to do it' he persists on and asks 'But why?'. I explain like a lot of my co workers I'm a student and living off a student loan in London is near impossible. He tries to push the conversation further but I explain I can't talk as I'm no longer filling his glass and my manager is giving me stink eye... 

So he and friend down their drinks. Not unusual but way this guy and his friend where looking at me just gave me hibbie gibbies. His friend, Guy 2 asks what and where I study. I tell him I study fine art. He then tells me 'Well you must be a loose kinda girl' while eyeing my up and down. Now I've been told off for flipping at guests before so I bite my tongue and say 'Well I work very hard for my degree'. Fortunately my bottle is now empty so I say I have to leave to get more. Guy 1 says 'We'll be waiting'

 So creeped out to fuck I shrug it off and carry on just making a point avoid those two and let one of the lads top up their drinks. Until Guy 1 taps me on the shoulder and asks if I am ignoring them. At this point I give a coworker a look showing how uncomfortable I am around these men. Guy2 looks me in the eye and says 'pour slowly'. I nearly threw up a little at that. Guy1 asks me how I'm getting home I say the night bus, he tells me that it's unsafe and offers me a ride in their taxi; I tell him thanks but no thanks. He tells me to not be 'a silly girl' and hitch a ride with them. I just smile and bite my tongue. As I finish one guy’s drink the other has downed his or thrown in into a potted plant. Guy2 asks 'how would I like to earn some extra money' I tell him I'm happy with my current job knowing full well what he was asking. Guy1 asks ‘But how much would it take to make you happier?’. 

At this point I feel like spitting in their faces but fortunately my manager has been informed I’m being bothered by these men and has come to rescue me. Guy2 says ‘aw don’t take her away I need another drink’ my manager tells him that someone else will fill their glass and that I am needed at the back of house.  I explain all of what they have said he gets as pissed as I was about it and refused to let me get the night bus but to get a lift home in the van. He told me it’s not the first time this has happened and wanted me to be safe I thought he was over reacting but wasn’t going to deny a free lift home. 

Fast-forward to my next shift and one of the lads told me those men had waited outside the venue for me and tried to get my number off them. Seems that rich men really feel like girls who are beneath them (at least economically) can be bought like that. It makes me sick to my stomach to think of what they wanted of me and to that they thought they could buy it.

1369013742.0	1eo0yr	Verbally Assaulted by a Lunatic on the City Bus, Who I Had Only Said Five Words To.	denihilistic	236	31	51	"About two weeks ago I was on the city bus on my way to the mall where I work. This is a trip I make like seven or eight times a week on average, and it's a fairly long ride. So there I was, sitting in my usual seat, minding my own business, headphones in, derping around on my phone, keeping to myself, when a man who had gotten on at the same stop as me shifted into the seat next to me. This guy was bigger than me, in a ratty t-shirt and shorts. He looked pretty dirty (like the way you get after being outside for a while on a hot day), and his eyes were open really wide and were a little scary. 

He tried to get my attention, so I took one headphone out and gave it to him. When I did, he started mumbling, “I know I’m not a very attractive male, but I find you very attractive and-” I cut him off, knowing where this was going, and said, “I have a boyfriend.” He got a little more gruff at this and insisted, “Will you take my phone number?” To which I quickly replied, “No.” And put my headphone back in, turning back to the window, just wanting this to be over. He moved back to his seat and for a few minutes I stared out the window and listened to my music.

I felt kind of bad and thought about apologizing for being so blunt about it, it’s just that if I dance around a rejection like that in an attempt to spare feelings, often times the guy just doesn’t get it and or keeps pushing until I’m really uncomfortable. I felt guilty until I listened past my music and heard loud conversation going on near me. 

Taking my headphone out, I could hear the same guy yelling out an insane and angry rant that was directed at me. The point I tuned in at, he was saying something about slitting wrists. He was calling me “a tease” and saying that I “lead him on”. That I didn’t give him any good reason and why wouldn’t I just take his number? I had said exactly five words to the guy, and four of them were ""I have a boyfriend"". Pretty valid reason. Besides, I don't owe him a reason for not being interested. Then he got in a rage about how, apparently, sunlight was reflecting off my phone and into his eyes and I was sending him mixed signals.

At this point I got out and readied my pepper spray, just in case. I am a very small woman, about 5'2"" and 118 lbs, and he was much bigger. He got up, apparently too pissed off to even sit near me, and stormed to the front of the bus. As he passed me he looked me right in the eye and said, “be glad I don’t have a gun”, put two fingers to his head, and pulled the trigger. His ranting just got louder and worse when he sat down towards the front of the bus. It would vary between angry growling that I could barely hear, to shouting directly at me. 
He called me a cunt, said something referring to “between my legs”, made a comment about how someday someone would “take it from me”. He said a whole slew of things, a lot of which sounded crazy and incoherently threatening.

I was scared. 
I was terrified. 

Not a single person on the bus seemed to notice this man harassing me, these horrible things he was saying. I sat there, stiff as a board, clutching my pepper spray, scared to ignore him completely in case he got up again and came after me. It was at this point that the driver, a young woman, pulled the bus over and told him he needed to leave. He argued with and yelled at her, eventually saying he would just shut up, that he needed to be on this bus. She shrugged and picked up the radio, presumably to call the police. At this point he gave in and got off the bus.

When I got to my stop at the end of the route I waited to be the last person and thanked the driver, who immediately asked me if I was okay and told me that a man getting off had alerted her to what was going on and she was amazed that no one else was doing anything about it. She told me, her words, that if he hadn't gotten off when he did she was about to fuck him up. 

I thanked her again and got to work, where it took me several hours to even stop shaking. I spent the whole shift scared that he caught the next bus and was headed for the mall, and that would see me and find out where I work. I spent the next week terrified that he would find me at the bus stop we both got on at, or on the bus, and this time he would have a gun. Like I said, I have to take that bus upwards of seven times a week. 

I've had some pretty scary encounters in the past, I'll probably share them here sometime, but I had never before been made to feel that unsafe."	t5_2t3t8	True
1331285122.0	qopj8	The little green arrow in the window....	blank_face	260	51	41	"I am back on my throw-away account. Posting another story, but this one is from my teen years. I am now living with my mother at this time in my life, and she is not like my Dad. I won't go into it....but my father taught us through strict discipline and my mother taught us what happens without said discipline.

Its 4:30 in the morning, and I am up taking a shower at the butt crack of dawn because I have to be up early to take Citifare to school. And we had 2 cars.....

So I am busy enjoying the long hot shower that takes forever because teenagers don't pay the damn water and heat bills. We have a window in the shower that is frosted for 'privacy', and I always crack it a little so the bathroom won't steam up when I put on my little bit of makeup. 

I am whistling along and soaping up...when I notice a tiny little green arrow in my window. I am like....*what the fudge is a little green arrow doing in my window?*  I stare more intently. I see some numbers, and a few green dots.....and then it moves slightly. **its a wrist watch** 

*Someone was inches away in the pitch black staring at me taking my shower*

I don't scream like a typical girl and act like a blithering fool, I straight up smashed my face spitting mad into the screen of the window about to bite his fucking nose off. I hear the voyeur choke and gasp as he falls from his perch and hit the ground badly. I then hear his frantic escape down the alley. 

I rinse quick, throw on my bathrobe, grab my practice wooden Kitana, and hunt barefoot with just a robe on down the alley. Stupid of me, but adrenaline always did that to me. 

Fast forward a few days later, I had a *feeling* that he was going to be back. I turn on my shower, crack the window, and wait outside in allll black with my favorite steel bat. Guess who showed up? My freaking neighbor, a married man with kids. 

I jump out of the bushes shrieking and probably slobbering and he trips and flees around the bend of the alley. 2 days later , I am in the passenger seat with my mother just barely managing to take me to school. I see him loading his family in their car. I stare deep black rage directly at him and actually knock my window in a mock punch and did the whole 'I'm watching you' bit. He looks genuinely frightened and hurries his family in the car and jackrabbits out and down the street. Mom confronting his wife about being a pedophile voyeur was probably the source of his panic. I don't see them the next month in the apartment across the way.

I still don't know how I survived my mothers half awake/half intoxicated attempts to drive me to school. Everything else was easy compared to that....."	t5_2t3t8	True
1376218624.0	1k50fa	She was really lucky	laceitupbro	238	35	11	"This happened to my half-sister in the 90's. Let me start off by saying, we live in a safe area, and we have a very low crime rate. At this point in time, my sister was 10-years old. Now, my parents have always been worry warts. Even though we live in a safe area, someone always walked my sister to the bus stop and picked her up.

One day, my sister walked to the bus stop, as usual with my mom. Once she got on the bus and off to school, my mom went home. After school, my mom was running late to pick her up, because she had to use the bathroom. 

My sister got off the bus, and noticed my mom wasn't there, so she began to walk home. While doing so, she noticed a man pull up in a car beside a younger girl that was 8 and started talking to her. My sister knew immediately something was off because the young girl never had anyone pick her up or drop her off. My sister freaked out and ran towards the girl. She grabbed her hand and started running home with her. He started chasing them in his car, but luckily my mom was just up the road running to get her. When he saw my mom, he took off. 

They never saw the man again after that, but my mom started to pick the girl up from home every morning and dropped her off at home after school. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1373860061.0	1ibfzx	My Biggest Bully	Theliterside	237	29	93	"I’m not certain that this story belongs on this sub but as it involves a story that does involve a level of stalking I figure I would post it here.  To gain a proper context of this story I should explain some things about the town I grew up in.

I lived (in still live) in one of the wealthier counties in the United States.  You have towns that fall in the low-middle class bracket with the majority being middle-middle to upper-middle class.  I lived in one of those towns.  At the time of this story (95-96’) the majority of this town was Caucasian with a few Hispanic and Asian families.  Seeing as I am a minority I was used to being teased and/or bullied due to the color of my skin.  As it was a suburban neighborhood it never went beyond racial slurs/light bullying though.  On to the story.

The town has five schools (not including the Catholic school).  There are two that cater to the Pre-K to fifth grade crowd while two others that go from Pre-K to eighth grade (one of each type on the north and south side of town) with a high school that takes in children from the north and south sides respectively.  I was attending the Pre-K to 5th on the north side at the time.  I had never heard much about a particular teacher until it was getting close to when I was entering the fifth grade but apparently everyone wanted to be in his class.  His name was John.  He had been teaching at the school for a number of years, his family participated in many town events, and he was the coach for the high school baseball and softball teams for a number of years after this incident occurred.  Parents loved him so much that they would push for their child to attend his class (it did not work that way; you were assigned to a teacher by alphabetical order, not by preference).  

For the first month or so I could see why everyone loved him.  He taught in a way that was quirky but practical.  He liked the children to engage in their studies rather than feel the need to cram it in before dismissing it.  He had a passion for every lesson he taught (keep in mind that for primary school the teacher would cover all topics from mathematics to history to English).  He loved to joke around and get his students laughing whenever possible.  That’s what lead to the beginning of when things began to go sour.  

One day he had told a particularly funny anecdote.  Everyone in the class began laughing.  One by one the kids began to quiet down until one student, A.J. was the only one left laughing.  To this day I do not know the motivation behind it but when A.J. could not calm himself down John walked behind him and, in a swift movement, grabbed the back of his head, slammed it twice against his desk before pulling it back up.  A.J. sort of toppled over and fell to the ground.  Everyone in the classroom was silent.  John then began to semi-kick/sweep A.J. out of the classroom (his desk was the second one from the door) until he was in the hallway.  And then, as though nothing had happened, he continued going on with his lesson.

The next day A.J. was absent, we had a substitute teacher, and all of the students were being called down to the principals office.  When I was called the principal was there along with a police officer (who I recognized from the D.A.R.E) program, and a man and  a woman in suits (I later concluded that it was CPS).  They wanted to know what had happened yesterday in class.  I told them what I had seen and I was sent back up to class.  Two days later A.J. was still absent but John was back to teaching.

I need to really stress that John and his family were very connected and well liked throughout the town.  I say this because though this happened almost twenty years ago I cannot understand how:
1.	He was allowed to keep his job.
2.	He knew that I had told the truth.

From then on out the abuse began lightly.  The first thing John would do is begin volunteering me to answer any and all questions he had while teaching.  It made no difference if other children raised their hands when he asked a question; he would always call on me.  I was always shy and never liked to stand out in a crowd and the more he did this the more I became nervous as, whenever I didn’t know the answer, he would chuckle and say things like “Of course you don’t.” or “I don’t expect much from you.”  
 
After a few weeks I began receiving detention for others misbehaving.  If kids were caught talking or passing notes it was my fault even if I was sitting across the room.  The first thing he did since “I was obviously such a trouble maker” was pick up my desk (it was a desk with the chair attached to it) along with me in it and move me to the back of the room near the closets.  As I was adopted (it was well known in my town as I had made a speech in fourth grade about how I was adopted but proud to be an American) the next step was having me face the wall as “Only true Americans should be allowed to learn.”  

One particular incident that I will never forget is when a classmate had made a paper plane and thrown it across the room.  When John saw that I had detention for the afternoon (I had detention almost every afternoon for the rest of the year).  When everyone else had left his assignment for me was to write a five-hundred word essay on the history of aviation.  Keep in mind I had no books, we were not learning this in social studies, and I was ten years old.  I was sitting in the classroom until ~4:30 when I finally stood up.

“Where do you think you’re going?” He asked, standing up to match my movements.
“I’m leaving.  I can’t do this and my mom is waiting for me outside.” (I lived six blocks from home but I was hoping he would think that I had a concerned parent outside he would let me leave)

When I saw that he didn’t believe that I dashed for the door without my books or backpack and bolted down the stairs until I hit the first floor.  I breathed a sigh of relief but it was cut short as I heard the second floor stairway door slam open and his footsteps rushing down the stairs.  I bolted out of the back doors and did not stop running until I was down the block from my house.  

At the time both of my parents were working.  My mom would normally get home at 3-4 whereas my dad was working until 6-9 at night.  My mom initially thought that I was saying these things about my teacher because I wanted attention but when it started to become common for me to come home and crawl into a fetal position as I cried for a couple of hours she began doing some investigating.  Before I knew it my mom was at the school after hours almost every day fighting for justice or to have me placed in another classroom.  Much later in my life I heard that my mom had a meeting with the principal and John.  She explained what I had told her had been happening.  John’s response to her was “I don’t really see what I’m doing wrong here.” with a smug grin on his face.  

The principal believed me and my mom and was willing to fight for me.  This is why I say that I wanted to stress that him and his family had leverage in town.  The day the principal promised us that he would begin investigating into the matter the board of education made him an offer.  In exchange for dropping any investigation they would promote him to superintendant.  Immediately he was gone and we had a substitute principal (who I also had later as a substitute teacher in the seventh grade).  I would think that he was told that he was there until a replacement principal could be found.  No investigations were ever launched and any further complaints to the temporary principal were met with “My hands are tied and there’s nothing we can do.”  

This story can continue for a while but I’ll focus on what happened as a form of retaliation for getting my mother involved.  One day right before recess John told my classmates (while I was in the room) that I was not a true American and people like me needed to learn my place.  He “suggested” that they do what they felt they should do to make me feel “welcome” on the playground and to spread the word to the kids in the other class.  The first day I went outside to play for lunch I had two kids double team me.  If I even tried to take a swing another kid who was standing around would push me so that I would lose my balance.  Since John had taken the volunteer role of watching over the kids during recess and lunch time no one came to my aid.  For the rest of the school year I was eating my lunch and spending my recess/lunch periods inside in the stairway with my niece and a few of the special education kids to keep me company.  

By the end of the school year I had gotten used to sitting outside of the classroom for portions of the class (my trouble-making was bad enough where sitting in the back turned away from everyone else wasn’t effective anymore), detentions were common, and my mother was in the office almost every day.  What I was afraid of most was that everyone from my class would be transferred over to the northern Pre-K to 8th grade school and since most of them had taken to beating me up on and off of the playground I feared that this would continue.  I do not know what had to be done but I was ordered to seek child psychology and there was an exception granted so that I could go to the counterpart school on the southern side of town.  

I have relayed this story and I know that it sounds far-fetched or completely made up.  After all, how could someone get away with all of this without any repercussions?  To be honest I do not have all of the answers.  I discovered later on that besides A.J. (who’s parents began at-home teaching from then on out) I was the only one who had told the truth about what had happened.  Later on kids admitted that their parents had told them to lie if they were asked about what took place.  When you have a teacher with tenure and a solid track record who is a pillar in the local community and donates money and resources to the town versus the word of two ten year olds I guess it was not enough to hold it against him.  I spoke to the old principal when I hit adulthood about the entire ordeal and he admitted that John had connections with the police and CPS (it was how he found out I had said something) and, though he hated to admit it, the principal had been bribed to keep his mouth shut and move on.  I told him that I held nothing against him and still speak to him on a rare occasion.  

I can say that John was a defining person in my life.  He changed how I saw the world, people, and the issues caused from that ordeal left me with issues that I still deal with today.  Even when I was 17 I would still have people who would throw food, drinks, (once a rock) at me because it was what they had been told to do by a teacher seven years earlier.  All I could do was make sure that my nieces and nephew never had to deal with him and try to move on as best as I could.  The last I heard he still coaches baseball and softball and still teaches.  He still lives in the same house he lived in when I had him as a teacher.  Though I have seen him around town I have never once spoken to him since fifth grade and the one time where we were close enough to each other that he could recognize me I do not believe he knew who I was.  That’s my story of the worst bully I’ve ever had.  Not from the hands of a student but from a teacher.  I apologize if it does not belong in this sub.  If it should be posted somewhere else please be kind and point me towards where it should be posted.  If you have any questions feel free to ask.  I will try to answer what I can.  If I am unclear about anything in particular I am very sorry.  I am writing this while I am very tired and I am recalling an event that took place almost twenty years ago. 

Edit:  Thank you to all of those who have expressed kind words or warm wishes.  When I posted this I did not expect this story to get the amount of attention that it did and it means a lot that so many of you agree that what took place was wrong.  I especially did not expect for people to become so angry at John that they have been requested his information.  If you read my responses below you will see why I am hesitant in releasing said information.  

To those who feel as though I should take vigilante action against him please understand that what you are advising or suggesting is illegal.  As I have no intention or desire to go to jail or commit a greater act of violence I will not entertain any suggestion of doing so.  So please guys, can we keep the ""You need to kill him"" comments to a minimum?

I went to Europe last summer with my three best friends.  We were all 19 at the time.  A week and a half into the trip we were in Barcelona, staying right on La Rambla.  One of us was sick, so the remaining three of us went for a walk along the harbour.  At the end of our walk, we found a large grassy knoll with a walking path and young people sitting around.  It was located right on the harbour, and was bordered by a busy street.  We decided to sit down on the grass off the path and just enjoy the night sky and this beautiful city.

It wasn't long before a man, probably in his late 20's, walks up the hill directly at us, completely ignoring the path and just taking the shortest route right to us.  At the very last second before walking pretty much through us, he swerves tightly around us, continues his walk trying to look casual, and returns to a bench situated at the bottom of the hill.  We were confused, but just figured maybe he thought he knew us and wanted to check it out before realizing his mistake.

A few minutes later, a second man in his mid-20's approaches us in the same manner.  Walks directly up to us, regardless of the path, on his cell phone.  When he gets close enough, he puts the cell phone down, receiver towards us, and - as we all noted - never hung up.  He then starts talking to us, asking us questions about whether we were going to party that night, where we were going, etc.  I think he said (in a very questionable accent) that he was from Portugal and on vacation looking for some fun.  We tried to be polite, but firm in saying we weren't going out that night.  He started asking where we were staying, to which we lied outrageously, saying we were with parents and a large group.  He was very persistent.

After we'd spent what felt like five minutes shutting most of his questions down, he said good night and began to walk away.  Right as he passed by us, he put his cell phone back up to his ear without dialing or answering a call.  He was continuing the call from before he'd came up.  The person on the other end had been listening to our conversation the entire time.  Every answer we'd given about going out or where we were staying had an audience in the person on the other end of the phone line.

To top it all off, he walked back down the hill and sat on a bench with the first man who walked up to us and started talking to him.  At this point, we were pretty convinced that the first man came up to scout if we were foreign, and the second was there to find out where we were staying for whoever was on the other end of the line.  So, logically, we booked it out of there, doing our best not to be seen by them.  We truly realized that day how important it is to be careful while travelling, and I hope all of you guys have safe trips when you travel too!"	t5_2t3t8	True
1366389742.0	1combz	Encounter with man-boobs	sk169	245	41	31	"Ok, so I am from India studying here in the USA in Texas. I stay in a 2 bedroom apartment with 3 other guys so its 2 guys in one room. My now ex-girlfriend lived in the Middle East (so night here is day for them), so to have phone conversations with her late in the night I have to often go outside the apartment and talk because I don't want my roommate hearing my cutesy late night 230 AM conversations. 

So, there was this one time when I was talking on the phone at 230 AM outside in the parking lot of the apartment block. The street across the parking lot is a fairly main street so there's cars going occasionally even at that time. This one car stops on the street and honks. I was on the phone so I pretty much ignore the honk. He honked again. I look up while I continue talking. The guy in the car saw me looking up and called me over. I was fairly new in the US at that time and so I did not know what to expect but I went anyway. As I approached the car, I saw only one guy sitting in the car. He was a fairly fat Mexican guy. The guy rolls down his window, takes his t-shirt off and starts licking his man boobs. I just stood there surprised and shocked. I believe he took my standing there motionlessly as an acceptance because he unlocked the side door and made a hand motion as if to come on in. I said no thank you and ran back inside. He then drove off away.

Now, whenever I have to talk on the phone late night, I go to the parking lot but sit in between two cars so I am not very visible.

1366048510.0	1cehfp	Found him in the closet, on a hunch.	So_Skandalouz	245	38	10	"At high school age, I went to a party a friend threw at their parent's house.  It was a fairly small group, and being new to alcohol and immune to hangovers we were getting fairly plastered.  

A female friend of mine, Kelly, invited me into a dark room, where we laid together, talked and started making out. She was pretty, with soft features and attractive lips.  It was the first time I'd ever made a move on her. In the room, the door was slightly cracked so that a small sliver of light was peering in. It caught my eye, and I noticed a crouched silhouette outside the door.  

I sat up, told Kelly to wait, and approached the door. I opened it to see a guy crouching there, caught flat-footed and unable to escape.  This was a friend of our group, Will, who was a bit older, in his early 20's at the time.  I could see fear and shame behind his glasses.  He was skeletally thin, and had a sort of nerdy appearance.  

""What the fuck..."" I said, and lifted him to his feet by his shirt. Kelly had noticed now too. ""Will!"" She said, sounding outraged and disappointed. I told her to wait for me, and that I was going to have a talk with him.

I took him into an empty laundry room, and he started crying and apologizing. He said he had a crush on the girl for years now, and couldn't stand the thought of me sleeping with her.  I heard him out and tried to be nice and not overly righteous about finding him like that.  I told him not to worry about it, that we weren't gonna have sex, et cetera.  

The party continued, I told one of my friends about it and we sort of laughed about it over a cigarette.  Maybe a half hour after the incident I went back into the room with the girl.  I had the feeling of being watched again, and it was sort of unpleasant.  So I got up, and acted like I was going to look around the room as a ""joke"", though I actually wanted to.  

I looked under the bed, nothing. outside the door, no one. Then I opened up the closet, and there were those glasses shining back at me. ""Jesus, Will..."" I said.  Kelly sat up immediately. 

For some reason I had the idea to be like ""just kidding, he's not actually here."" to give him a chance to escape or something.  But she got up and saw him in there. He looked so pathetic...it was horrible.

Anyway, I lost my chance at any action right there. Kelly's brother slept with his back against the door in that room since she was so freaked out.  The brother spotted him in the wee hours of the morning looking into the window, and this occured in intervals until the morning we all left.

Needless to say it estranged him from that particular group of friends. I feel bad about it, but it was very creepy to have experienced.  I guess love makes us so do some crazy things...

tl;dr Guy watched me make out with a girl from the doorway, was caught by me, hides in the closet to watch again, is found again, then peeks into window regularly throughout night."	t5_2t3t8	True

I stood there in utter disbelief, staring at TJ for what must have been a full minute. He didn't say a word. There was a glassy look in his eyes, one of cold indifference. He looked down at me from the porch like I was a mouse caught in his trap.

Finally, I stepped forward. Cautiously, I watched his hand for any sudden movements. As I extended my arm, he spoke.

""Hi. My name is Henry Ford. Do you know where 48 High Street is?""

He never blinked. Never shifted uncomfortably, scratched his head, fidgeted... When the snow is coming down that hard, you rarely see people stand still. They are constantly brushing the frozen flakes from their face, adjusting their sleeves, fixing their gloves, adapting their hair, etcetera. His gaze was stoic. In control. Ready. 

I shook my head in disbelief. ""TJ, I know who you are. You need to leave, now.""

""I'm looking for 48 High Street. There's a party there."" He responded.

His serious demeanor, the one I had never seen him turn off, slowly melted from his face. He turned up the corners of his lips to reveal a sickly, painted smile.

""Dude, you need to..."" In one fluid motion, he reached back with the baton and cracked it across my ribs.

The sharp ache was incredible. For anyone who says a baton isn't a serious weapon, you've obviously never been hit with one. At the moment, it felt as though he had shattered my entire ribcage. It was one of the few moments in my life where I've seen stars and nearly blacked out due to the pain. 

Luckily, I have a feeling the whiskey dulled it enough. I reached back, and responded with a right hook to that sick son of a bitch's face. 

He screamed one of the most unholy noises I've ever heard. I can't even think of the proper comarison to that fucking noise. You're going to laugh, but it sounded like the noise a howler monkey makes when it finds an enemy in it's territory. Immediately, barely losing a step, he hopped to his feet and ran off down the street.

At this point, my room mates had begun to pour out of my house. They were half asleep, but knew something was wrong. I was kneeling in the street, cursing up a storm as I watched him sprint around the corner.

-------------

A week later, TJ was kicked out of school.

My ribs weren't shattered, only deeply bruised. I was very lucky. I had to wear a thick layer of bandages for a couple of weeks to ensure that nothing *did* break accidentally. 

That night, we had phoned the police. My testimony about the fight outside our house did very little, to be honest. No one had seen it. My room mates had come outside just after TJ had ran off, and were left with me shirtless in the street, clutching my purple ribcage. Police officers immediately pointed out the fact that I was intoxicated. How would I know who the hell hit me in my condition?

The end result? TJ never got any criminal charges. 

Luckily, there were other things we could do. Alyssa filed a restraining order, and was allowed to return to her house. Two armed police officers patrolled our block every night for a week, at our request. 

For a while, none of us heard from TJ. Alyssa resumed sleeping at our house once the police patrol was finished, but things slowly began to return to normal. She soon began to become the normal, carefree girl I had known Freshman year once again. Though she still refused to sleep or walk alone, She no longer nervously checked her email or Facebook every ten minutes, and she even began to go out to the bars some nights. Eventually, even I stopped carrying around the small knife in my boot when I went out at night. 

We thought he had finally given up.

Around two months later, I was up late one night watching old episodes of Six Feet Under on my laptop. You know the routine, don't you? It's always 'Just one more episode!' This excuse is the reason for my being up at three in the morning. Anyway, I was lamenting on the fact that the main actor looked far too much like Joel McHale when my laptop buzzed a happy alert. New message! I opened it up, and this is what I read.
(*Btw, I don't know how these messages aren't still in my inbox. I wanted to post some screen shots, but it doesn't look like they're there anymore. Could this be because he deleted the account?*)

---
FROM Frank Ford IX:

Hello, you don't know me. I'm a friend or Alyssa's from Bio. I think she got a new number, and I need to reach her about a study group.

---
*This troubled me. First of all, how the hell would this guy know I was Alyssa's friend? Fearing the worst, I responded.*

---
FROM Matthew:

Sorry man, can't give out her number. Just get it next time you see her.

---
FROM Frank Ford IX:

Stupid FUCKING prick. How about I come over there and make you fucking tell me? You know I'll find it.

---
I nearly threw my computer out of the window. Three in the fucking morning, I did not need to deal with this shit. I didn't grace him with a response, I simply deactivated my Facebook account.

I spoke to Alyssa the next day, and the look on her face told me everything I needed to know. The messages themselves weren't overly threatening at first. Usually, he would just ask how her day had been going. How was that new club she was in? What did she think of the current political climate. What was her Biology professor like? Alyssa ignored him entirely.

Eventually, he got her new phone number. I have no idea how. At first, he would call her every night. She would never answer, of course, so he would leave a ranting voicemail. The topic of these messages usually varied. Sometimes it would be a ranting political anecdote. Sometimes he'd talk about biology, or a recent Jim Carry movie that came out. 

Other times he'd scream at the top of his lungs for her to pick up the goddamn phone.

---

Over time, the voicemails and messages began to decrease. She would get one a week, then one every two, then one a month. As time moved by, Alyssa's attitude towards the situation changed. It became apparent that TJ was no longer something she could eradicate, moreso something she would have to live to live with. 

Junior and Senior year went bye relatively normally. He would still call her here and there, but the nature of the messages was nowhere near as threatening. Sometimes he would say he had the wrong number, and sometimes he would just talk. 

It was weird. He just sort of... faded out. By the time we graduated college, none of us had heard from TJ in six months. Most of us had changed our numbers a few times and used fake names on our Facebooks, but that had never worked in the past. We thought he was finally seeking help.

And maybe he was. Honestly, I don't know. What I do know, is the reason that I am bringing this all up now. The reason why I am telling you, why I desparately need to get this off my chest for the sake of my own goddamn sanity.

Last Tuesday night, I got a Facebook message from Henry Ford. The first in years.

----
Did you miss me? Help me find her, or I'l find you.


I wish I could give you a concrete ending. Good guy catches bad guy and throws him in jail for the rest of his life. Bad guy finds the help he needs and mends fences with those he terrified for the better part of a school year. All's well that ends well, right?

The truth is, I don't know where TJ is. I don't know if he's still watching my old apartment, or if he knows exactly where I am. He could know where I work, where I sleep, who I'm dating, what I'm writing.. Hell. He could be reading this right now, for all I know. 

So I will leave you with the same response I sent to Henry Ford on Tuesday night.

I'll be waiting."	t5_2t3t8	True
1372153749.0	1h126g	How would that even feel good?	1piperpiping	239	32	28	"I worked at a state park one summer doing maintenance - mainly cleaning bathrooms, mowing grass, maintaining campsites, etc.  We usually worked 8-4:30 but once in awhile there were programs at the park, and we had to stay late either to set up for the net day or because the program was in the evening.  There was also a historic village in the park, and people would sometimes rent the chapel on weekends for weddings - this was one of the things we sometimes had to stay late to set up.

One of the first things I was told on the job was to not be surprised if we saw people doing the deed out in the woods. Apparently the park was a popular hookup spot for people.  If we saw them, we woulld tell them to stop, and sometimes call the park rangers if people didn't stop or were rude or threatening.  Most people just looked sheepish, stopped and moved along.  Mainly we didn't want little kids to be exposed to that.  The park rangers patrolled at night too, and said they would catch people in the park then too, mainly teenagers, cheaters and gay men (my boss actually showed us all website of how our park had made some sort of top ten list for local hookup spots on some sort of forum for cheaters and another one for gay men, the park was apparently just a good hookup spot). The park rangers would usually just write down plate numbers and tell people not to come back, and then write a ticket if they did.

So one night we have to stay late, and it's around sunset, we're getting ready to go home.  As we drive through the historic village, we see this naked guy just furiously rubbing his balls on the outside of one of the brick buildings.  I mean this guy is just slamming his balls on the wall (yes, balls to the wall) and rubbing them up and down.  I didn't bother paying attention, but the coworker I was with said the guys sack was starting to bleed.

So we start yelling at him to get out of there, and call the park ranger on the radio.  The guy just sprints off into the middle of the woods.  One ranger comes to talk to us, the other one cruises around, and gets the other maintenance truck to do the same, looking for cars in the lots.  We check them all and there's no cars that don't belong to staff.  Whatever, freaks gonna freak, we figured maybe this guy had been meeting someone there and got carried away or was on drugs or something.

Anyway, a few days later, one of the park rangers who wasn't there that night asks me and my coworker to come see him and go over the story.  We tell him what happened, this guy just rubbing his balls all over this historic building and all and then disappearing.  BTW, he had no clothes with him, so he must have stashed them somewhere.  Anyways, the park ranger tells us that he had caught some teenagers a few weeks before making out in the park who had told them about what sounded like the same guy.  He thought they were bullshitting to try to get out of trouble or something, now thinks maybe they weren't.  Same building, and right around sunset (which is strange, why not wait until dark?).

After that the rangers kept an eye out for the guy, and my coworker would check for blood marks on the building every morning.  A couple times he insisted he found them.  Someone else reported seeing the naked guy later in the summer doing the same thing, but no one else did after that.  MY biggest question to this day though is who, literally, gets off by rubbing their sack violently against historic buildings?"	t5_2t3t8	True
1351838621.0	12i5mi	"""I made you. You belong to me."""	AMQR	259	52	36	"Four years ago I met a woman named Courtney. Over the course of a year she stalked, tormented and threatened me and several of my friends.

 I had moved from Kansas to Pennsylvania after my husband got a job working in the Oilfield. I severed ties with all the friends I had back in Kansas and decided I was going to start fresh. We settled into our gorgeous new home and got back to our normal routine. I am a young stay at home wife. I am unable to bear children and me and my husband decided we didn't want to do any medical treatments and we'd accepted a child free life. Soon I realized that I was painfully lonely. I hadn't made any friends and my husband was often gone, sometimes for days on end. I eventually found a group on Facebook for Oilfield Wives. And eventually I met a woman named Courtney. She was very much like me, we lived fairly close, had the same sense of humor, was young and even was unable to have children. I immediately clicked with this girl and eventually we met for coffee. 

She was spunky, funny and a social butterfly. Honestly I was slightly envious of her. We both were woman of larger size and she still seemed to have the confidence of a size 0 super model. She could talk to anyone. I, on the other hand, was fairly shy, reserved and mostly awkward. I obsessed about my weight and really didn't have much confidence. Courtney changed that. She'd take me shopping and show me what looked good on me. She pressured me to talk to people, coached me on how to make friends. She was like an Angel to me.

 After a few months of very close friendship I was practically a new person. I loved myself. But I started to realized I was becoming a lot like her. I've always been an individual, a unique person so it didn't sit well with me that I was practically becoming her mini me. I took a lot of advice she'd given me but put my own personal twist. I dyed my hair a funky color and changed my fashion style to something more *me*. 

I had more friends and probably the best social life I had ever had. Due to having more friends I had stopped spending nearly as much time as I had with Courtney. I could hear the devastation in her voice when I would tell her I had other plans that night. I felt incredibly bad when I had to turn her down but I still maintained a good relationship with her. I still considered her my *best friend*. 

But that was all about to rapidly change.

It was a Saturday, I had just kissed my husband goodbye as he was headed off to a 3 day job and was getting ready for dinner with some girlfriends. My phone rang, it was Courtney. I told her that I had plans but I would check with the girls who'd invited me if she could come. I didn't want to just bring her along. I called Stephanie, someone who'd become another extremely good friend, close to being consider my best friend. Stephanie told me that apparently one of the girls that was going to be out dinner had some sort of drama with Courtney and that Stephanie had only made reservations for four, not five people. I called Courtney and told her the bad news. She sounded upset but brushed it off and said it was no big deal and that she'd find something to do. I finish getting ready and headed out to dinner. While at dinner Stephanie started receiving messages from a blocked number saying ""Cunt"" ""Whore"" ""Bitch"" amongst other texts. I had a sinking feeling it was Courtney but honestly didn't want to believe it. This was the beginning on the long crazy train Courtney took me on.

Stephanie continued getting nasty texts and it brought us closer. I had confided in her that I thought it may be Courtney and that I would talk to Courtney about it. I confronted Courtney who vehemently denied it. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and brushed it off. After confronting her Courtney had began to be very stand offish to me. I figured she was pissed because I had blamed her. Soon everyone I would hang out with started getting texts from a blocked number saying the same things. Then I started seeing Courtney every time I went out with my girlfriends. At first she'd come up to me and exclaim just how crazy it was we ended up at the same bar/club/restaurant. Eventually she just stopped saying anything. She'd just stare. She'd sit somewhere near by and stare. At this point I had talked to her less and less because her craziness was just escalating and I honestly couldn't stand being around her.

Eventually after seeing her for the billionth time at the same place I confronted her. I was angry. It was obvious she was following me just to give off bad vibes. And she was the one behind the texts.

I strolled up to her and said ""What the fuck is your problem?""

""Nothing.""

At this point I felt a little bad for being so harsh so I calmed down, I said ""Look I know your sending the texts and the first two times we ended up at the same place was coincidence now it's obvious you're following me. I don't appreciate it. My friends don't appreciate it. I'm sorry that I've been more distant but your behavior is freaking me out""

What she said next chilled me to the bone.

**""I made you. You belong to me.**

I didn't even know how to respond. How the hell could this crazy woman think she *owned* me?! I told her that it needed to stop and I didn't want a thing to do with her any longer. I stormed off and went about my night.

Two months go by and I hear nothing from Courtney. I figured it was over, she'd find someone else to ""own"". I woke up one morning to a billion texts. ""Check your Facebook now"" ""Are you awake? Get on Facebook ASAP"" ""I can't get you, I think you're asleep. I tried hacking your facebook but I can't figure out your password, I really hope you wake up soon. It's bad"" 

and finally one last text from a number I didn't recognize

""Check your Facebook. I hope you like my handy work ;) -C ""

I yanked open my laptop and logged onto Facebook. Plastered all over my wall were pictures of me. Nude pictures. I quickly took a screen shot of what I could and then deactivated my Facebook. I went through the nudes, I never took nudes, not even for my husband for this exact reason. Upon closer inspection I saw a tiny tattoo on ""my"" left hip. A tattoo I knew Courtney had. She had taken nudes of herself and Photoshopped my face onto her body. I called the police, they informed there was nothing I could do. I couldn't prove it was her.

Over the course of the next few months, she began stalking me. I'd see her when I went to buy groceries, when I took the dog for a walk. At the laundromat. My tires were slashed and my windows were busted out. The police refused to do anything. I could never prove it was her. She'd leave threatening voice mails. My friends had several similar things happen to them. She'd leave dead flowers on my porch. She'd text my husband making it seem that it was a mistress he had. Amongst a billion other things.

Then the crazy hit the fan.

She kidnapped my fucking dog.



There is much more to this story but I've already made a huge wall of text. If anyone is interested I will certainly post the rest of my story.

1351195929.0	12319x	The Difference Between Being Nice &amp; Being Ignorant AKA Why I Never Pick Up Strangers Anymore	Savioritis	235	29	40	"It's 3 AM on a weeknight and I'm driving home from a 15 hour shift. My mind is pretty much asleep from exhaustion, and my critical thinking skills have all but abandoned me for the night. Luckily, I only lived about 10 minutes from work at the time.

Quick history: About 3 months before this, I had a suspended license due to a legal dispute I was fighting. Being a 19 year old faux-rebel, I continued driving anyways. Of course, the law caught up with me. I had driven home without my headlights on one night and was cited and etc.

Pan back to 3 AM, and I'm crossing an overpass towards my apartment. My car windows are down since I'm smoking a cig and the only sounds are the rare passing cars. Suddenly, I hear a voice shout out ""Hey! Lights!"". I look out the window as I pass by a woman carrying some bags, waving her arm at me and yelling out. I finally notice that it has seemed a bit dark on the road... My lights had been off. I flip them on and curse at myself for being such a fool. Though in reality, this was only the beginning of my foolishness that night.

I think to myself, ""Wow, this woman just saved me from a ticket!"" A red light sits at the end of the overpass, and I see that she is walking in the direction I am headed. Why not return the favor? She saved me around a hundred dollars, I can save her time off her journey! 

Now, I lived in an iffy neighborhood. Even though it was right down the street from the college campus, it still wasn't the kind of area to be making friends with random people at 3 AM. I looked at the woman from my car and made a quick assessment: Her clothes seemed clean, she seemed near my age, and the bags were Kroger brand. Any other time I would have still just gone home, but my mind was set on helping this person who just helped me. Even if she was homeless, which I doubted from my assessment, I had experience with such hitchhikers. I kept a serrated blade in my car in case anyone I helped became unruly (which has happened twice before, always ending with a hinted flash of steel and the asshole quickly retreating from my car). My hazy mind had made itself up as I pulled a U-turn and headed back over the overpass.

The woman stopped walking and looked at me as I pulled up. She was extremely cautious as I stopped, which made me feel better since I figured a prostitute or thief would be much more relaxed. The streets are pretty much empty besides me and this woman.

""Thank you,"" I smiled at her. ""You saved me from a ticket. I've already got enough money problems as it is! I was just on my way home from work, I could give you a ride if you're headed somewhere in the area.""

She walked up to the car with bags in hand. As she got closer, I can tell she's a bit older than I thought: Late 20's, maybe early 30's. Her bags are indeed filled with groceries. It still hasn't clicked that no sane woman would be walking with groceries at 3 AM... She smiled with lips closed and looked through the open passenger window at me.

""You sure? I live right round this corner, but I wanted to make a stop somewhere first..."" At those words, my brain would normally be screaming 'HELL NO', but instead I tell her it's no problem after how she helped me, and she tosses her bags in the back before getting in. Her voice has a bit of southern influence, and her hair is a little dirty, but only as if she hadn't showered in a few days, no worse. She begins to tell me how she lives in an apartment that I knew of not far from where I stopped. She then tells me that she wanted to make a stop though, as one of her friends had gotten something for her and she was afraid her friend's boyfriend would steal it if she didn't get it tonight. More signs of 'this shit is fucked up', but my brain was already half asleep. She says she needs some money, so we stop at a nearby gas station.

""Shoot, I thought I had more money than this."" She eyes my wallet with a quick glance as I pay the cashier for a drink. I don't have much thankfully, otherwise this story could have ended much worse. ""Do you think you could spare like ten bucks?"" Ten bucks is a lot less than a hundred, so I hand her some cash and we get back out onto the road. Most of our talking is limited to directions, but she asks if I go to the college or work. Small talk, nothing personal or deep. That's when I start to notice where she's leading me... The BAD part of the neighborhood. Trash is littered everywhere, shady characters are shuffling around, and it's only getting worse the more I drive. We reach her destination, where two very intimidating black men are standing outside a liquor store. She gets out and asks me to turn around in an alleyway, and she would be back. 

'Shit... I fucked up.' My exhausted mind had finally realized this wasn't a smart idea, but instead of just bailing, I decided not to abandon her. I wouldn't have found this a good reason to risk my life if I had been of sound mind. I pull into the narrow alleyway and turn around in a small spot. I drive just enough to the edge so that I'm visible from the main street. The two men standing at the door glance at me, and I reach beside my seat to find my knife, gripping it tightly as though it was some sort of reassurance that I was gonna be fine. If I had been attacked, that knife was not saving me. The biggest of the two comes up to my window and peers around my car. I keep my coolest composure possible. He tilts his head up and I do the same. He asks if I'm there with the woman, and I nod once before he simply backs away. At that moment, the woman runs out and hops back into the car. She's smiling and says everything is good. I could not be happier to get the hell outta there.

She ruffles through her purse and asks excitedly if she can smoke in my car. I ask if she means cigarettes, and she smirks at me, saying she has something better. My mind jumps to weed, and without asking if it was, I tell her sure. This is where, exhausted or not, my mind finally notices that 'I done fucked up'. The woman pulls a small bag from her purse and a clear pipe. The contents of the bag are not green. In fact, they look completely unfamiliar to me until she pulls something out.

Crack

Fuck. I picked up a fucking crack head. I am so fucking dead. She is going to kill me, steal my car/money/identity, and then sell my organs for drugs. My mind is racing so fast that I don't even notice that she has been holding the pipe near my face for a moment or so now.

""Hey baby, you gonna hit this or what?"" I snap my focus to her and my stomach turns a little. I see her teeth for the first time: Yellow as the sun and brown as dirt. I try to think quickly, but my brain hasn't been functioning enough to stop all this from happening, let alone get me out of it. I've done crazy shit before, but this was too much. 

'If I deny her, will she get upset and attack me? I don't want to smoke crack!' My hand finds its way to my knife handle... 'Am I going to have to murder her? What do I do!?'

I look at her for a minute, then shake my head, keeping as cool and calm as I'd been all night, even though I was literally freaking out on the inside. ""No thanks, drinking and smoking cigs are enough vices for me.""

...

She laughed. It takes me by surprise as she shrugs her shoulders. ""We all got vices,"" she says before taking another hit, ""I know how it is, baby."" I exhale a huge breath of relief. 'This may turn out okay', I think to myself. As we drive, keeping a hand on my knife and the woman firmly focused on her drugs, the road is empty. We get out of the BAD area without problems, and I feel like I'm home free.

""Oooooo..."" 

A moan comes from my passenger, one that would have made my hormones jump if it were from anyone else, but instead sends a sharp pang of terror through me. I look out of my peripheral vision to see the woman with her head tilted back, blowing another hit, and moaning as she exhales. ""Shit..."" She smirks, eyes closed and feet stretched out as far as possible. ""He gave me them wicked rocks.""

""What?"" I ask, letting my fear come through more than I would have liked. Wicked? Were they laced? Was she going to OD in my car!?

""Oh right, you don't go for rocks."" She opens her eyes coyly at me. ""Its that good-good."" She says matter of factually, like I'm supposed to get it from that. She moans a little again. ""Them horny rocks..."" Her free hand slides down her jeans as she hits her pipe again with the other, moving in an obvious way.

""Oh yeah?"" I reply. Really I'm thinking, 'OH HELL NO! This is not happening!'

""Hey, since you don't go for this... How bout we go pick up some 40's...""

No.

""...maybe an ounce...""

No!

""...go back to your place...""

NO!

""...have a little fun, hmm?""

OH FUCK NO!

""Uhh, actually, I'm a bit broke. I didn't get paid when I should have, ya know."" Maybe she would be disinterested if I don't have money. But instead, she just frowns, her hand still at it.

""Oh, that's okay baby. You done a lot for me. I just wanna pay you back...""

""It's okay, I told you, this was for helping me out. 'Sides, I just got off work, I'm ready to crash."" I may have been a hormonal 19 year old, but I was not THAT hormonal! Luckily, I saw her complex come into view, and so did she. She pouted and stopped her little playtime as I pulled up and stopped at the entrance. She packed her items away in her purse and got out. Grabbing her bags from the back, she looked back through the passenger window.

""You sure though? I could just come back to your place and... rape you a bit..."" 

I sped off without a second thought, leaving her there in the lot. Through the streets and up the hill, screeching into my parking lot, and making a mad dash for the complex. I slammed and locked the door, turning with my back to it, letting out a breath I had been holding since first escaping what may have been the most ignorant and creepiest night of my life. I was so exhausted, I slide down to the ground and fell asleep right there at the door..."	t5_2t3t8	True
1375413282.0	1jjia0	q-tips and hotel shampoo	buffyb	230	25	17	"Several years ago I was living in an apartment alone.  I was living paycheck to paycheck so the apartment wasn't in the classiest area of town.  Since it was the seedy area of town there were quite a few homeless people in the area.  There was one particular guy who was always hanging around the apartment building.

My apartment was an addition to an older building, so I had a separate outside entrance that opened directly into my apartment rather than going through the main entryway of the building.  There was a hedge near the front of the building with a space/path in it and this is the shortcut I would take to get to the front of the building to get my mail.  If the creeper wasn't outside of my door he was generally near this hedge.

I got off from work at midnight.  I got home one night and was about to unlock my door when I heard a shout of ""Hey, little sister!""  This was what our resident homeless guy has decided to call me.  He asked me for something, a cigarette I think, and I declined.  I was glad that I hadn't unlocked and opened my door yet, because he asked if he could use my bathroom and looked like he'd have pushed his way in if possible.  I told him no, and said that I had forgotten to stop at the store on my way home so I had to leave.  I went to a 24 hour diner, had a couple of cups of coffee and went home.  When I got home I didn't see the guy anywhere, so I rushed inside and locked my door.  The next day, when I went to get the mail I walked through the hedge.  I happened to glance down and there were several empty bottles of shampoo that were the size you get at a hotel.  There were also many, many q-tips.  I thought it was a little odd, but didn't give it too much thought.

The next night I was lying in bed, just getting ready to sleep when someone started pounding on my door.  Then I heard the shouts of ""Little sister!  Little sister!  I need to use your bathroom!""  All of the lights in the apartment were off, so I just chose to ignore him.

I woke up at about 3 in the morning.  I went out into the kitchen to get a drink and noticed that my cat was out of food.  I turned on the light so that I could find the food in the cabinet.  I finished filling the cat's bowl and was walking across the kitchen to put the food away when the lights went out.  

I walked out of my door to see if it was a neighborhood wide power outage (not the best plan, I know).  At 3 am, ALL of the lights are out, so there was no way for me to really tell.  I was too tired to deal with it, so I went back inside and went to bed.  

When I woke up the next morning, the lights were still out.  I called the electric company and they said that there were no outages in my area.  I went downstairs to the ""utility room"", which was not at all secured.  Every breaker for my apartment had been flipped to the off position.  I wondered why it would have happened but didn't give it a lot of thought, until I got back upstairs.

When I got into my apartment I went to the bathroom and turned on the light.  The toilet seat was up.  Remember, I'm a female and was living alone.  On the countertop of my sink there were 2 empty hotel sized shampoo bottles and several used q-tips.  I called the cops

They figure that the creepy guy had tripped all of my breakers.  When I went outside and looked around, he went inside.  They asked me if anything was missing.  It wasn't.  They dusted for prints on the door to the breaker box and took the shampoo bottles and q-tips.  Nothing ever came of that, but I never saw my ""big brother"" again."	t5_2t3t8	True
1373861126.0	1ibh7j	Caught an intruder thanks to my video game addiction	Pillage_the_Comics	252	48	88	"I'm a female, in my early twenties, and I generally live alone. Occasionally I'll bring home a girl from the bar but I'm not in a relationship so it's never the same gal and it's never on a regular basis.

Anyway, my apartment is pretty decent sized. The front door of the apartment opens up to a parlour with a doorway to my kitchen and a doorway to a hallway. At one end of the hallway, connected to the parlour is my bedroom and at the other end is a small laundry room then off the laundry room is the living room. The only windows are in my bedroom, the laundry room and the living room. Typically I keep all my lights turned off except for the room I am currently in. 

This happened yesterday. My brother had phoned me in the morning telling me L.A. Noire was on sale on Steam but it was a daily summer deal. I hadn't been at my desktop all day so all day I had been putting off buying but it was a game I had really wanted.

So when it was just about time for the sale to end when I realized that I hadn't bought it yet. My apartment complex is really old and has wood floors. There's a spacing between each floor so when I walk it kind of echoes through the house. 

I was in the living area on the couch on my laptop like usual when I thought I heard the door open. I just figured it was one of my six cats and continued on my laptop. So I didn't think anything of it then I looked at the time and remembered I had forgotten to buy the game. I bolted from the couch and ran through the laundry room (sounding like a herd of elephants I'm sure due to the age of the apartment complex), through the hall and as I passed the door opening to the parlour I heard a huge crash against the floor. It creeped me out so I continued to my room to grab my cell phone and a pocket knife. I called out ""get out of my house, fucker"" but there was no response. At all. However, as I began walking out of my room to the door leading to the parlour I heard someone like scratching against the floor. I walked quickly into the parlour and turned on the light to see a very large man (very tall, very bulky muscles) scrambling from the floor and out my door. A neighbour who had heard the crash was out in the hallway and we called the police. We're awaiting response to see if they caught him or not. 

It was scary. Definitely makes me want to lock the door all the time. Normally I don't because I know all my neighbours and I'm at the end of the hall so I never considered someone coming through the complex and robbing the farthest apartment from the lift/staircase.

TL;DR Guy broke in, fell to the floor when I ran past him trying to buy a video game before it went off sale, eventually escaped the apartment."	t5_2t3t8	True
1372137189.0	1h0r0c	"""Honey...I'm home!"""	UltimateSpinach	235	31	17	"I had, shall we say, a very *interesting* childhood growing up. My parents emigrated from Europe to a large metropolitan city in North America when I was five. [I am now an 18 year old female] For the first few years we bounced from apartment to apartment in various working-class immigrant neighbourhoods. 

When I was seven, we moved into a rather large apartment complex [15+ floors] and my family occupied the apartment on the very first floor. Our living room window faced the “backyard” which included a decent playground complete with a swing set and slide. Now, this is where the story gets strange…**the land lord.** He was your fairly typical middle aged dude. At the time, my mom was 27 and very beautiful [google Shalom Harlow – they could’ve passed for twins]
 
When we first moved in, he was friendly enough but within months he became quite obsessive. At first it was randomly popping up in places he knew my mom would be – like collecting the mail or while we were out playing in the park at the back of the apartment building. He eventually began harassing her – asking her out on dates etc. Knowing full well my mother was married with a kid. Not surprisingly my mother turned him down every time.

This is where shit gets real. One day after school a family friend dropped me off at home – my parents would be at work until 8. So just like any other day, I sat in front of the TV watching my cartoons and twirling around pretending to be Sailor moon. Fuck yeah. A few hours must have gone by when suddenly I hear a knock at the door. I was a very paranoid kid and I knew for certain that it couldn’t be my parents [they had a key and it was too early for them to be coming home] the knocking continued for what seemed like forever…until I hear someone stick a key inside. 

Now, my mom would have announced herself. I knew right then and there that it wasn’t her. The adrenaline kicked in and I ran into my bedroom as fast I could – where I hid under the bed, being careful not to make any noise for fear I’d be discovered.
I hear heavy footsteps walking around the apartment until **bam** – he’s inside the room. Now, I didn’t see his face, only his shoes, but I recognized him instantly. He stood for a few seconds at the door of the room before turning around and going into the other rooms. He must have been in the apartment for close to 15 minutes before leaving. 

I was young at the time so my memory of the details are hazy but when my parents returned my mom checked her things – and sure enough it had looked as though someone rummaged through them, and then attempted to put everything back in order.

My mother was horrified and angry…but my parents were young and in a new country and didn’t really know how to handle the situation. We lived there for another 6 months before moving. I don’t know what possessed this dude to enter our apartment unannounced without a 24 hour warning prior [which landlords are required to do] I guess it just shows what an unstable twat this dude was. We saw less of him after that incident, though. I don’t know if he ever came into the apartment again because I spent my days after school at a family friends from that point on until we moved. In retrospect, we really should have alerted the police because what he did was highly illegal, and not to mention disturbing as fuck.

1361564444.0	191gk6	"Coworker Literally Held Me Hostage to Perform ""Satanic"" Ritual and Debate Stendahl"	stellalugosi	243	40	32	"When I was around 24 yrs old, I moved to LA and took a job as an ESL teacher at a private school for international students. I had very little experience teaching, so one of the other instructors, Heather, took me under her wing. I thought Heather was pretty cool, she was in her early 30s, had traveled the world, had been a professional ski instructor in Colorado, and seemed like a fairly put-together individual. We went to book fairs, shopping, had lunch on a regular basis, and nothing ever seemed off or unusual about her.

One night around 10pm, I got a frantic call from Heather. She seemed genuinely panicked and told me someone was trying to hurt her. She was crying so hard I couldn't make out most of what she was saying. She said she was driving to my house, and she was going to stay on her portable phone until it lost signal (this was before cell phones were common). About 20 minutes later, she shows up at my door, drunk off her ass, still clutching her phone. She tells me her mother is a Satanic witch and is trying to cast a spell on her to kill her, that she needs to be somewhere safe. After spending an hour trying to calm her down, she asks if she can use my phone. I say, ""Sure"", and she proceeds to call her ex-boyfriend long distance from my house TWELVE TIMES to leave creepy Linda Blair growlings and unintelligible animal noises on his answering machine. By now, I am desperate to get rid of her and more than a little afraid. I didn't own a car, so I offered to drive her home in her car and she said she would give me cash to take a cab home. 

She lived about 7 miles away, so it didn't take long to get her there. She begged me to come up to her apartment to ""make sure it was safe"". I get her into her apartment and things get really ugly quickly. I tell her, ""Well, looks safe to me, I'd best be on my way."" and she suddenly turns around with the most evil and predatory look on her face, points a can of what looks to be fucking BEAR MACE at me, and says, ""You aren't going ANYWHERE."" This was some seriously creepy serial killer behavior. I cooperated with her as best I could, participating in a weird ritual she concocted to protect her from her mother's ""spell"", watching her roll her eyes, contort her body, and make gurgling noises, speaking in tongues, and every once in a while she would lunge at me and hiss like a lizard. The entire time she had the can of mace in one hand and was waving around a butcher knife in the other. She kept stabbing at imaginary ""demons"" with the knife and making hissing noises. It was unreal. 

When she seemed to calm down a bit, she made me sit on her couch and debate the difference between Stendahl's view of the French aristocracy vs de Sade's. I shit you not. She was mostly incoherent, and I haven't read Stendahl, so the conversation was sort of like the scene in ""The Vampire's Kiss"" where Nicholas Cage is talking to his imaginary girlfriend on the street at the end. I tried to act normal, like we were just having a typical conversation and I didn't have a ginormous can of mace pointed at me. Every once in a while I would casually mention that I should probably head out, and she would begin to get agitated again, even once barking at me like a dog until I sat back down. By this point I was more tired and angry than afraid, but her behavior was so unpredictable I couldn't be sure what she was capable of. She mentioned having a gun and asked me if I wanted to see it, and I thankfully managed to distract her by offering to make her another drink. This lasted several hours, she always had either the mace or the knife in her hand, usually both, and at one point she even had me get out her family photo albums for us to look at. She continued to drink more, and each time she had to pee she left the door to the bathroom open so she could see me, Since the bathroom was across from the front door, I didn't want to risk it. FINALLY, she became so drunk that she forgot to leave the door open and I made my escape. I ran down the steps of her apartment building and out into the streets of Hollywood at 3:30am. I had only been living there a few months, I had no idea where I was, I had no money, didn't know where an ATM was, and didn't have anyone I could call for help. I started walking, and a cab pulled over and asked me if I needed a ride. I explained the situation to the driver and he took pity on my and drove me home for free.

The following Monday at work she acted like nothing had happened. She didn't even seem to remember calling me that night. I said nothing, avoided her like the plague, and eventually left that job about 2 weeks later for a better paying one."	t5_2t3t8	True
1370294365.0	1flvkp	Just discovered this subreddit! Thought I would share my experience with a total creep from my early teenage years	schmoo757	233	32	40	"Ok so starting off, when I was 13 we moved into what was originally my stepdad's parents' house. My room faced our back driveway (we had a front and a back driveway) that was connected to the garage. In the driveway was our basketball goal. 

I've always been a bit of a night owl and the summer after we moved into this house I was already back into the swing of falling asleep at 4 or 5am and walking up at 1 or 2pm. Since it was summer, I would open up my windows to let some fresh air in because we all know how rank a 13 year old boy is. 

One night in particular, I looked outside my window and saw a guy walking up and down my driveway. The driveway didn't have any security lights or anything like that so I couldn't really make out what he looked like but I could tell he was wearing a hat and what seemed like a pretty heavy coat. I watched him for a minute to kinda figure out what he was doing, then I walked to my parents' room, woke up my stepdad and told him about the dude outside. My stepdad walks out the back door, me behind him, and there was nobody out there. He looks at me pissed and tells me to go to sleep because it was late and to not wake him up unless there's actually something going on.

Fast forward a few nights later and I see the same guy pacing up and down my driveway. This time I just sit there and watch and after 5 minutes he leaves. 

Another few nights later I se him again only this time he's just standing in front of the basketball goal, staring at it. I consider going to my parents room again but then he started doing something that completely caught me off-guard. He grabbed the post and started hitting his head against it over and over. I just sat there looking at him from my room mouthing inaudibly ""What.. the fuck.."" 

He does this for a good couple of minutes then leaves. 

The next night he's back and does it again. By this time I'm starting to get wigged out by this and I tell my stepdad and mom the following evening about what's been going on. They think I'm completely full of shit.

That night, he was back, beating his head against the pole. This time, mustering up all my teenage courage, I yell out to him, ""Hey! You better leave or I'm calling the police!"" He abruptly stops. Looks at my window and runs. I think to myself, hey alright I got him to leave. He shouldn't be coming back. 

I was wrong.

The next night, as per usual my windows are open. I glance outside and there he is. Only this time, he is standing on the edge of the driveway facing my window. Just staring. I jump up, yell I am going to call the police again but this time he just stares. I am thoroughly freaked out so I slam my windows shut, close the blinds, and run to my parents room. Wake up my stepdad. Tell him what happened. He tells me to get my ass in bed and not bother him again.

I did not sleep a wink that morning. 

The following night, because I couldn't sleep at all the night before, I fell asleep at around 9pm. My windows were closed. I woke up around 2am randomly to something tapping on my window. I slowly get out of bed absolutely terrified. I crawl over to my window and lift up one of the blinds at the bottom and sure enough, there he was. He leans over to get on eye level with me, smiles, waves, then walks away. At this point I decide it's time to call the cops. I call them. They come. They find nobody. My parents are PISSED. I get grounded. I PLEAD with them telling them that there was a guy outside my window. They were having none of it.

A few days later I had been cleaning so my windows were open. I forgot to shut them but I had the blinds down. I hear a scraping noise on one of the screens. I run to the window, lift the blind, and the guy was there cutting into the screen. Now all the windows and doors in the house have decorative iron bars on them that are locked. He was cutting into the window that had the key hanging on the window frame. I scream, slam the window shut, run to my parents room freaking out begging them to do something. They look at my window and conclude that I cut the screen myself and they extend my grounding sentence. It's really at this point when my mother says she wishes she had listened to me back then.

I stopped keeping my windows open. I started sleeping in one of the living rooms. I was terrified. After about a week of sleeping in the living room we started getting phone calls. It started as someone calling the house then hanging up immediately. Then he started talking. If I answered the phone, a man would say, ""You can't hide in there forever, kid."" or ""I hope you know these cute little bars won't keep you safe."" 

Then my parents started getting calls at their work. Apparently he would call them saying things like, ""Did you check in with your boy today?"" 

Finally we got the police involved and everyone FINALLY took me seriously. We decided I would go stay with my grandparents for awhile and we had a police patrol come check on our house every now and then. When things settled down and school was about to pick back up I went back to my parents' house. We got rid of our landlines and I got my first cell phone. I haven't had anything happen since then, but the fact that they never found anybody still freaks me out and I still refuse to sleep with windows open.

1349702239.0	114wk1	The Man in the Ice Cream Stand	Hghwytohell	231	29	37	"I grew up in a suburb of Philadelphia, in a very nice town with a lot of great people in it. However, it's in a bit of a bubble, meaning that the towns and areas surrounding it are not the nicest places (crime, drugs, homeless people, etc.) My town never had much of a problem with these things, but once and awhile, someone would come over and cause some trouble. This is a story of one of those times. 

I was 10 at the time, and my father and I had a habit of going for ice cream after my karate lessons. The ice cream shop we went to was a small outdoor stand right next to the gym (yeah, great placement I know). It was a quiet, local place that was usually pretty busy, but since my karate lessons didn't end until 9pm, the time the shop closed, we were usually the only ones there at that point. It was owned and run by an Irish man named Mr. Murphy, who knew us by name and was always very outgoing and friendly. I should also mention that the gym and this ice cream stand were located in a large strip mall with quite a large parking lot, which was notoriously frustrating to get out of as it had 2 one way entrances but only 1 exit.

One day, I had stayed at karate for an extra hour because my father had to work late and couldn't get me until 10. Luckily, the gym was open late, and my karate instructor stayed with me until my father arrived. The rest of the parking lot was fairly empty, as most of the stores were closed. When my father finally came, we walked over to the ice cream stand, thinking that it was probably closed, but to our surprise the metal screen was only halfway closed, and there was a light on inside. We figured Mr. Murphy was still there, and since he knew us, he might be willing to serve us late. My dad knocked on the counter and asked if anyone was there. No one answered, but we heard some rustling around, like someone had suddenly moved and knocked something over. My dad knocked again, this time silence. We were about to turn and leave when suddenly, the metal screen opened up.

Inside the stand was not the friendly ice cream man I had known, but a tall, skinny, heavily bearded man wearing a windbreaker that was at least 3 sizes too small. I couldn't see what he had on below his waist, but he wasn't wearing a shirt and he smelled like my dog after rolling around in the mud all day. He had a very creepy grin on his face, showing a crooked row of yellow, nicotine stained teeth. His hair looked like it was falling out. His eyes were squinting, as if he couldn't see us clearly. He stared at us for awhile, then cocked his head and started to speak. 

""You buy ice cream?""

That voice. I can still remember that voice perfectly. I'm not going to say it sounded inhuman, or devilish, or unnatural, because that's simply not the best way to describe it. It was disturbed. It was delirious. It was a bit insane. And his smile after he said it. He tilted his head down a bit, so I could see the top of his balding hair, as his grin grew wide from cheek to cheek. My dad instantly grabbed me and turned me away. He shouted at the man.

""Who are you? Where is the owner?""

""You buy ice cream?""

""How did you get into the stand?""

""You buy ice cream?""

""I'm calling the police.""

It was at this point that the man placed something on the counter. He held it in his fist, so I couldn't see it at first, until he opened his palm and held it out to us. It was a small knife, probably one used to cut fishing wire and such. Small, but sharp. My dad had enough at this point. He picked me up and threw me in the car. He came inside and locked the doors as he took out his cell phone to call the police. Meanwhile, though I was as scared as I had ever been in my life, I turned back to look at the stand. The man was not in the window anymore, but *outside of the stand, walking slowly towards our car.* Not only that, but he had the small knife clenched in his fist. I was choked with fear, and couldn't speak, but I did reach over and shake my dad's leg. My dad looked out the window, saw the man approaching, and immediately turned on the car and sped off. 

I mentioned how there is only 1 exit to the parking lot. One of the reasons it's so annoying is that it exits onto a busy street with a light, and even at 10pm it can be difficult to get out immediately. We went through the exit lane, but had to stop at the end since there was a light and cars were speeding across from us. Even though we were stuck for a minute, my dad looked behind us and told me he didn't see the man anymore. I was starting to feel a little better until we felt something thud against our trunk. We turned around and there he was,screaming something indecipherable, banging on our trunk. His grin had turned into an angry snarl, and his eyes were open wider. I screamed as my dad decided to floor it into the oncoming traffic. Luckily we didn't cause an accident, but my dad raced home at about twice the speed limit. 

Over the next few days it was all pieced together. This man had apparently broken into the ice cream stand after the owner had left and was sleeping in there. The door was locked, but he was able to pick it. They got some fingerprints off the door and inside the stand and were able to ID him. He had a pretty long police record but no other documents of residence, ID, even birth. There was a current warrant out on him for aggravated assault and attempted rape. My dad went and gave an official statement of the incident to the police, but after that everything just pretty much went back to normal, as they usually do in these stories. I don't know if they ever actually caught the guy, and as far as I know no one else in our town ran into him. The man became almost a figment of my imagination, and if it weren't for my father re-telling the story to everyone he knew, I may have even forgot about it entirely. 

The only mystery left in the story was the ice cream stand. It never re-opened after that night, and I never saw Mr. Murphy again (that's not saying much, since I ever only saw him at the stand). I never asked my dad about it, since I find it awkward to talk about the incident with him, seeing as he sees it as a heroic escape story and I see it as a memory to forget. Still, I find it odd that such a successful, ambitious man like Mr. Murphy would close down his shop for good overnight. I guess that's the disappointing part about stories like these; there's always that one unsolved detail that will bring you back to the memory you want to forget.

Thanks for reading, I know it was long but I hope it was worth it. This was my first post to /r/letsnotmeet, but I have a couple other stories that i'd love to share with you guys, some that happened to me and others that happened to people I know. If you enjoyed this one, i'll definitely post more.

EDIT: Spelling and Grammar

UPDATE: So I talked to my Dad today and remembered to bring it up. He was surprised that I didn't know or that he never told me, but apparently Mr. Murphy closed down the shop after the incident because the man did some damage to the inside of the stand that would be expensive to fix. The cooling system for the ice cream was nearly totaled, and since business wasn't good and he was nearing retirement anyway, he decided to close down the stand rather than fix to have it repaired. I never saw him again only because I had never seen him outside of the stand. My dad said he moved out of town a while ago, he doesn't know where. So I guess that solves that mystery. I feel sorry for the guy, he was nice. I guess it isn't as exciting an ending as it could've been, but i'm just happy that nothing bad ended up happening to him. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1344290142.0	xsefc	Footprints In The Tub	charliethebird	240	39	94	"I originally submitted this in nosleep but it should be here.

This story is as accurate as it was on the police report.

March 14th, 2008. I was 17 years old, a junior in high school. I lived in a square mile suburban town in Nassau county, one of the richest counties in America. Life there was very quiet. The population is white and Catholic. Not much goes on.

I had been struggling with depression and couldn't focus on my school work. I had a paper and a whole bunch of homework I hadn't done the night before, so I woke up at 7 am and made my way downstairs to my mom's room to ask if I could sleep in, catch up on some school work and go to school late. She agreed.

I woke up around 10 am, later than I had anticipated. I walked downstairs, poured myself a bowl of cereal and said good morning to my poodle. That's when I heard knocking on the door. At first it was regular, calm knocking. I didn't think much of it but didn't want to answer the door in my pajamas. I picked up the house phone and dialed my mom's phone number. She was at work (as a church secretary).

""Hey, mom? Are you expecting anybody at the house? Someone is knocking on the door. No? Could it be the cable guy? No? OK, I won't answer it.""

After I hung up the phone, the knocking continued. It increased and started becoming more rapid and frantic. I peaked through the curtain and saw a bluish pickup truck outside my property and a man standing at the door. He had a red hat on, denim jacket, jeans and sneakers. No logos, no uniform. I didn't get a good read on his face. He kept knocking! At this point it was riling up my dog, and he was barking on top of the knocking. I swear, the knocking seemed to go on forever.

I checked the locks on the doors to make sure they were secure.

Then suddenly it stopped. Quiet.

Creak. The sound of the side gate to my house.

My pulse raced. Maybe it's the meter reader? I stood in panic in the living room.

The next thing I heard was shuffling coming from the bathroom. Could it be my cat playing with the shower curtain? I had to check. I walked down the hall and peered around the corner to see inside my bathroom. I'll never forget what I saw.

The window in the shower was pried open. In the middle of my bright and sterile bathroom was a dark mass pouring in through the window. One leg at a time.

Oh, fuck! Do I run outside the front door? What if there's more men outside to chase me down? Side door? Too close to the bathroom.

So I bolted up the stairs as carefully and silently as I could. I heard my dog barking incessantly. Not in a panic, but excitement. Happiness.

I closed my bedroom door behind me as quietly as possible. I didn't shut it all the way as to not make any noise. Cellphone. I picked it up and wondered who would come quicker... 911 or my mom who was at work less than a mile away. I dialed her number.

In a whisper: ""Mom... mom... there's someone in the house... mom, there's a man in the house...""

The creak of his footsteps on the stairs. Fuck! Think fast! I ducked underneath my desk. I could hear one step at a time as he slowly ascended the stairs. It was like a movie. I quickly dialed 911...

That's when my bedroom door slowly opened. His head peered around it to scan the room. That was it, he saw me. I dropped the phone before I could hit call and instinctively put my hands over my head as he rushed at me with a crowbar flying through the morning air.

“Please don’t hurt me! Please don’t hurt me!”

“Don’t scream! Don’t say anything!”

With a gloved hand, he struck me in the face, sending my glasses flying. Blind. I fell to the ground and squatted with my hands over my head. He took my cellphone. I was shaking and my mind was racing. I’m going to die. He dangled the crowbar over my neck. I could feel the iron tip graze the skin. He was standing over me. How much will this hurt? How long will it take? What will it feel like having a crowbar in my skull? Fuck! My mom is on her way home... Not her too! This is it. I’m fucked. He rummaged through my things on my desk. Then there was silence. Is he still in the room? How many people are inside my house? Is there anyone in here with me? I didn’t want to know.

I heard my house getting trashed downstairs. I could hear my dog jumping and barking at the invader(s?) and I could hear them hushing him in a baby voice.

“Shhh, doggy... shhh, doggy...”

Quiet again. For what felt like hours.

I heard my name. I was stunned and confused. I heard it again. My mom. I ran down the stairs. The front door was wide open. There she was in my living room. I burst into tears and told her everything. I was still in a panic. Was he still in the house? Was he hiding?

We called 911. They came and investigated. A pillow case (to stuff the items in), my iPod speakers, a brand new camcorder, laptop, and leather jacket (for disguise) were the items missing. I spoke with a forensic artist. The cops drove me around the neighborhood to take a look at suspects they stopped on the street. He was never caught.

After everything was settled, I needed a shower. I sobbed when I had to scrub the tub of muddy footprints.

My post traumatic stress terrorized my life. I had to sleep in my mom’s room. I kept a knife under my pillow. Everywhere I went, I thought I saw the man who robbed me not only of my personal belongings, but my overall sense of safety. It didn’t help when at school the principal made an announcement about the break-in on the loudspeaker. He told the entire building that I let my attacker in and referred to him as a “gentleman.” This twisted the story completely. So much so that a rumor went around school that my attacker raped me and that I liked it. A whole lot has happened since then. And now I’m much happier. But, I still feel the effects of PTSD today.

The scary thing here is that he was a landscaper. My family never had enough money for landscaping but both our neighbors did. Landscapers are given access to people’s yards (sometimes when they’re not home) and have plenty of time to scope out unlocked windows, access points etc. He probably didn’t expect anyone to be home because I didn’t answer the door. The moral of the story is to always answer the door. Or if you don’t feel safe answering the door, make a noise to signify that you’re home. And of course, call 911 first!

My mother comes from a rich family. Her father won the lottery and bought a jet company. This attracted the attention of a man named Brian.

Brian came from a small town in Nebraska. His whole family were chiropractors, and he went to school to be one,too. He grew up a normal life, with brothers. He was a kickboxer, and won many contests. He was a GOOD kickboxer.

He went to school to be a chiropractor, got a luxurious job and met my mother. My mother had a pair of male toddler twins, with another man, unmarried. In Brian's eyes, they were disgusting mistakes. My mother lost custody of them after their father walked in on Brian beating them or screaming at them. Her whole family turned against her, thinking she let Brian hurt them.

They were married shortly after. There is no evidence. No certificate, no pictures, no witnesses.
He came to my mother at her condo and told her that God told him that they could have sex now, and that nothing would come from it. My mom reluctantly agreed. That was the day I was conceived. He wasn't around for much of the pregnancy, but when I was born they moved into a condo. From there, things got creepy.

On my third birthday, something changed in Brian. He saw ""The lion king,"" and then told my mother it was time for him to ""Follow God's journey for him."" He left his job, and took my mother and I to live in an creepy man's 1 bedroom house. The man's name was Jack, he was a patient of Brian's. 
As I grew up, my father never left the house, and I was constantly monitored. I wasn't allowed to speak to other people, except for other neighbor children. I slept on the floor in the bedroom, and my mother slept in the bed; my father slept on a few blankets beside me, watching me. In addition, I was forced to be home schooled. 

Moving on a few years; We moved to a slightly larger house because ""God told him his enemies were close."" Jack came along. The house was under his name, and it had 3 bedrooms so I finally got my own. I was about 7 now. 

Brian had many...odd things he did. He'd sleep through most of the day, but when he did, he would have his hands raised and talk ""In the spirit."" every time somebody came in. He would sleep on the couch, in the living room, or kick me out of my bedroom and sleep there. If you would wake him up during one of his naps he would scream, ""I was so under the holy spirit! It was like I was beneath a pool, it was beautiful and you took me from it! God was talking to me! GOD HAS TOLD ME TO PUNISH YOU!"" and would ravenously slap and kick me. If he was in a better mood, he would be ""Deaf in the spirit,"" and only able to communicate through a weird ""sign language"" and glare at you, only hearing every other word you say. He would ""Be in the spirit"" on the trampoline in the backyard, in the car, leaning on the back of the car. Frequently, he would have his genitals exposed while sitting. As a 7 year old, I wasn't sure what that was.

At least once a month he would walk into Jack's room, dragging me by the arm, sit me down and scream at Jack for ""Spiritually molesting his daughter."" If I began to cry or get scared, he would begin to slap and scream at Jack louder and harder. 

My mother has been broken the entire time I've known her. Once they were married, he threatened each of her family members and friends, so she had nobody left to speak to, not one friend. She turned to alcoholism. She was a shell of a person, it was impossible to go to her for help. All she could do was lash out and wait for her turn to be beaten.

Eventually, I made friends with the neighbor girls. I was awkward; I'd never had friends before and I rarely saw other children. Every time we'd have a small petty fight, over things like what game to play- ""I don't want to be your friend anymore!"" fights- Brian became involved. He would interrogate each of them asking what I had done wrong, and then approach me and lock me into our laundry room or a closet for ""Being disgusting.""

I lost those friends quickly. I turned to having pets. Brian allowed me to raise rabbits, because as a jobless man living on his mothers' checks and Jack's retirement money, he could make me raise and sell the baby rabbits. They were pure white Lionheads, so they were worth a lot.

One day I decided I wanted to keep one of the kits as my own pet. I named it Turkey, and I loved him so much. Brian did not want me to keep it, as it would cost more to feed, and my mother agreed I should keep it. This made him very angry.

Here's where the stuff gets dark.

Brian was mowing the lawn before I was supposed to take the 4 baby bunnies outside to play. I took them outside afterwards to the bunny patch I created and fenced off (Using sticks,so he wouldn't mow) after 20 minutes of them grazing, I took them back inside. A few minutes pass, and one of them starts to utter this screaming noise, and I begin to panic. Its nose starts to bleed, and it starts to spasm. I start crying and screaming for help, but my mother wasn't home (She would walk to the park and drink at the picnic area) and Brian had mysteriously left. 
The bunny begins to become paralyzed, still bleeding and uttering screams,scaring the other 3 babies. A few minutes pass, and he dies, his face frozen in a scream. 

I knew what death was, but I was so scared. I held the other bunnies and sobbed and wailed. 

Until another baby began to scream. I've never shouted louder than I did at that moment, holding him and praying to God to not kill the baby. The same thing happened, with me bursting into hysterics...and each of the babies began to scream and twitch and bleed, even Turkey.

Just as Brian walked into the door, the last one had died, with me holding four dead baby rabbits, screaming in terror. He immediately called me a monster and told me to ""Get off his property before I kill you you fucking murderer!"" I took off outside to the bunny patch and sat there sobbing and wondering why they died and why God would do that to me. I turned, and saw a few feet away from the bunny patch... Insecticides. Poison for ants and roaches, that kind of stuff. I picked up some grass from the bunny patch and realized it had been sprayed, and that was what had poisoned them. I immediately began blaming myself for not knowing. Brian came out later and threw the dead babies at me in a plastic Publix bag, and told me to bury them.

A few months pass. I discover the internet, I'm 8 now. I have 3 large, Bagel-sized turtles, and one baby, quarter-sized turtle in a giant tank outside. I love them all so much. I spend most of my time in the AOL Children's chatrooms. One day, I'm invited to a sleepover by a neighbor girl. Brian says I can go, and I ask him to feed Meepy (baby turtle) and the rest of my turtles. I spend 2 full days at her house having so much fun, and come home to the turtle tank to check on my Meepy.

I don't find Meepy. What I do find is a tiny, quarter-sized half of a shell. The inside looks like the top of a brain, and there's no blood in the water... just the top of his shell. I begin to scream and my mind tries to tell myself that he simply crawled out and found a new shell. Brian hears my screaming, and comes outside and says, and I quote, ""This is why you can't have pets! You can't take care of anything! Are you going to kill your children too and forget to feed them? They ate him because you starved them!""

A few more months pass. Abuse is plentiful, every time I get banned from the AOL chatroom it would end in him beating me mercilessly for being a moron, or him forcing me to take off my clothing (down to my undergarments) and sit outside in the cold at night for a few hours until I ""Learn to be a person.""

One day, I find a baby squirrel in the backyard, squeaking for help. I take care of him for a few weeks, and keep him in the garage outside. I feed him cheerios and nuts and he never tries to run away. Every time I go into the garage he runs up my leg, and onto my shoulder to give squirrel-kissies. He was the sweetest thing. He grew to be about a teenager squirrel; 
Until one day Brian saw I had gotten kicked off the AOL chatroom. I'm in the garage with Hammy, and he screams, ""If you don't get inside in the next 10 seconds I'm going to fucking beat you!"" I rush inside and slam the door behind me... but Hammy was following me inside. His back legs are caught in the door, and he becomes paralyzed. I begin to panic, and Brian comes outside as I haven't met my time limit- and sees me holding Hammy's now half-paralyzed body. Of course, this is my fault. He gives me the usual lecture about how I must have autism and will be a murderer one day.

Hammy is alive and okay, and now drags his body around by his front paws. He's as happy as ever. Until I got grounded from seeing him for the weekend, and my mom is to take care of him while I'm in my room for the few days.

Finally,the third day comes. I rush to see him...and when I open the door, he doesn't come running to me. That's weird. I look around, and eventually I see a large tank of water, with something dark floating in it. I peer inside, and it's hammy. He had drowned in it, and you could see his claw marks where he tried to climb out. Who knows how long he had been floating. Logically, Brian told me this was my fault and I wasn't allowed to have pets after that. But I began to make friends at the church he took our family to. 

A few years pass, I'm 13 now. I've learned that normal fathers don't expose themselves and normal families have jobs. As I begin to go through puberty, Brian begins to get more graphic and quicker to punish. If I ate leftovers of something he wanted, drank his soda, left a towel on the floor... He would do things such as ripping open the shower curtain and punching my naked body until I was curled into a ball on the bottom of the tub, or forcing me outside in my underwear when it was raining and under 60 degrees.

But it gets worse than just animals.

1357559649.0	1646un	Creepy classmate I tried to avoid for years.	thebluesharpie	247	45	36	"I was going to a smaller college at the time and there was this overly forward guy who asked wtfpersonal questions. I didn't know his name at the time (Emmanuel), but he would always approach me if he saw me and talk to me. I never told him my name but he would say ""Hey thebluesharpie, are you heading to biochem?"" What the hell? How do you know my class schedule?

I knew this was a person I wanted to avoid, so I successfully did for about 2 years, other than random walkby encounters.

Then, at the start of a new semester, there he was, sitting in my freaking classroom. Great. I attempted evasive maneuvers in the beginning, lagging behind until he left, or gtfoing as soon as I could. 

Eventually though, he got keen to it and would either wait for me or catch up. One day, he followed me all the way to my car and asked for my phone number ""In case I miss and need notes"". Damnit. I am not prepared to be overly rude to someone's face without actual creeper confirmation. I hesitated and finally obliged, figuring I could just ignore all calls and texts. However, I knew I made a mistake immediately because he then said, ""Answer when I call.""

...

That is not a question or suggestion, he was making a statement to me. Great, good job me. On my drive home immediately after, he had called me 3 times in 10 minutes. This was MINUTES after we had just talked. I texted him and said that I was on the phone, what did he need. He replied that he wanted to hang out. I told him that I work nights (true and I thought it was the perfect excuse) and that I couldn't hang out during the day because school and work were my priorities and I didn't have free time. He responded, ""Great! I work nights too, lets hang out Monday.""

....

I again told him no, I don't have free time and that I will see him in class. He said okay and the conversation was over. Later that night while I am at work, he texts me and asks me if I'm working. Wth. I didn't answer.

The next day he texts me and says ""Want to hang out Monday?"" This is the same freaking Monday he has already asked about and I said no to. I replied the same way. I do not have time to hang out, I'm sorry but the only time I can see you is in class. He said okay again and the conversation was over. All this time he is continuing to follow me to my car, usually by waiting for me if I didn't get out fast enough, so I even changed my parking area so I could walk out with a male friend from class to the same parking lot he was in.

Texted me a few days later asking me to come over. I asked why, he said because he needed help studying. I told him ( a few times because he persisted) that I was not a tutor and could not help him with studying. He then said he was just testing me. (what?) Then he asked me why I was so mean (like 4 times). I finally said as diplomatically as I could ""I'm sorry, you may not have meant it, but I am feeling really uncomfortable and I would like you to delete my number and stop contacting me."" He asked what he did, I repeated myself, he said okay.

Things were good. About a week or so went by with no issues or contact. Then, I'm walking (finally carefree) to my car after the class we shared and I unlock the door and get in. To my fucking HORROR, he opens my passenger door (didn't know he was following) and GOT IN MY CAR. 

In no pleasant or diplomatic manner I told him, quote ""Get the fuck out of my car."" My face was locked forward, I was not looking at him and my door was open. I was frozen. It was flight or fight at its best and I was frozen with the hint of fight slowly creeping on. I repeated my quote with no changes over and over again, louder each time. He kept saying he needed a ride home, why couldn't I give him a ride home? Eventually, when it was clear he wasn't moving (he is laughing this whole time like a freaking maniac), I jumped out of my car and yelled (in a public college parking lot) ""SOMEONE GET THIS GUY OUT OF MY FUCKING CAR."" I was very quickly not alone and the guy scrammed. I then texted him and said if he ever contacted me again I was calling the police and filing stalking and harassment charges.

Thankfully, I never heard from him again.

I have now learned my lesson. I don't care if you don't seem like a creeper, even one bit of uncertainty and our conversation is over and you are getting no more information.

TLDR: Got stalky text messages and was followed to my car after class until I told him to stop. He then one day gets IN my car while I was in it. I freaked out and threatened him with everything I had and haven't heard from him since.

1357226734.0	15w307	Do you know where Newtown is?	Bunnykitty	244	41	29	"A few weeks ago, right after the day of the tragic massacre in Newtown, Ct, my boyfriend and I went to see a late showing of The Hobbit in a city nearby.I should clarify that we live in lower New York, on the border of Connecticut, extremely nearby Newtown.

The show started around midnight, and the movie is about three hours or so long. The ride home from the theater is about an hour drive on the highway. Needless to say, we were in for a long night.

We left the theater around 3. I barely made it through the movie without falling asleep, so I took the opportunity to curl up in the passenger seat of the car on the ride home and catch a nap. After about a half hour's drive I'm aware of the car pulling over and stopping, and look for a second just to see that my boyfriend had stopped for gas at a rest stop. We're the only people at this rest area, so I feel okay closing my eyes and continuing to nap. I listen to my boyfriend pump gas, then drift off for a minute or two while he goes inside. 

When I hear the bell of the gas station door open, I figure my boyfriend had paid for the gas and was coming back to the car. I opened my eyes to see an older man in a beat up, workman-style jumpsuit and jacket smiling like a lunatic and crossing the parking lot, snapping his fingers, walking directly toward the car. I panic for a second before I see my boyfriend leaving the gas station building and heading toward the car (and at this point, the man.)

The man smiles at me when he sees me laying in the passenger's seat and I bolt upright, but I'm lucky that my boyfriend intercepted him on his way to the vehicle. My boyfriend is a very no-nonsense, capable guy, and he just glares coldly at the man and pushes his way past him to the driver's side door.  

""Hey! HEY!"" The creeper is still smiling like he just won the lottery. ""Do you know where Newtown is?!"" He's shouting at this point. I'm really unnerved because that day our community lost a lot of people, children and neighbors. No one had been smiling all day after the news of the 27 murders, and especially not when talking about them. This guy is showing every last one of his teeth and looks about to burst with happiness. I have no idea what a man wants with this information or why he'd be looking for Newtown at 3:30 am the day after the massacre. We have Connecticut plates on our car, but being as how we live on the border of the state, it's not too uncommon. My boyfriend continues to stare coldly at the man and just asserts ""No,"" as he gets in the car and closes the door. The man is standing so close to the vehicle that my boyfriend bumps him with the door when he opens it. 

My boyfriend locks the doors and doesn't make eye contact with the man at all as he starts the car, even when the man starts knocking on the window and smiling a toothy ear to ear smile. 

""You look like you know! You know where Newtown is!"" He's screaming at the window, still smiling. ""You fuckin' know where it is!"" Pounding on the window while my boyfriend drives away, the man still standing so close to the window that I'm worried we'll run his feet over as we leave.

While we pull out onto the highway I look into the rearview mirror and see the man still standing in the parking lot under the gas station lights, facing our car and watching us, waving and smiling ear to ear. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1327971542.0	p3tnl	[MY] Experience at the gas station	amyalc	228	27	45	"About 10 years ago, I worked for a short time at a small gas station close by to my house. Both of my kids had started school, and we always needed extra money. I was about 26 or 27 and had not ever really worked anywhere before, but it was fun. We stayed a little busy throughout the day, as there were three factories very close by, and would get a lot of our traffic from  the employees there, especially at shift change times. 

One weekday, mid-morning, I was working by my self, which was unusual, but my manager, who usually worked days with me, was out sick. No big deal, was no more than I could handle. There were people in and out all morning, and nothing out of the ordinary was happening. Until a transfer truck pulls in, and parks to the side of the building. We didn't carry diesel fuel, but it wasn't unusual to have big trucks pull in for drinks, bathroom, whatever. 

The driver walks in. Tall guy, not unattractive, but a little creepy looking. He had a huge refillable coffee mug, and asked me if there was fresh coffee, and could he refill his mug. I told him no problem. He fills his mug, and comes up to pay, and starts chit chatting. He told me that he had a delivery for one of the factories up the street, and asked what would be the best way to get in there, so I told him. No big deal, happens all the time.

He then started telling me he was from Arkansas, and that after he dropped his load, he was headed back home for a few days. I was just politely nodding my head. Then he asks me if there was a restroom. I told him yes, and pointed to where it was, but did not come out from behind the counter. He starts trying to chat with me again, without going to the restroom. He asked me if I was working alone, and that's when all kinds of signals start going off in my head. I told him my coworker had to run an errand and would be right back. 

He winds up staying in there for about 20 minutes, trying to small talk, and asked me at least 6 or 7 times where the restroom is. During this time, customers were coming in and out, and when someone would come in, he would walk around the store, kind of behind the shelves. At this point, I am trying to stay calm, and figure out what I need to do to get him the hell out of there!

I looked out at the gas pumps, and I saw a man from one of the factories up the street on a forklift, filling it with gas. When he comes in, I was trying to start a conversation, and ask him stupid questions to get him to look at my face, so I could gesture where creepy-guy was standing, behind the potato chips. He didn't catch the hint until he walked out of the door, and turned back to look at me, and I mouthed to him, ""Help Me!""

He turns around and comes back in, and by this time creepy-guy had come out from behind the potato chips. Forklift-guy asks me if I am OK, and I tell him no. He asks if I need help, and I say yes. All of this being said very low, where creepy-guy cannot hear. All of a sudden forklift-guy runs around the chips, and slams creepy-guy into the Coke cooler, telling him that the lady wants him to leave, GTFO!! 

Creepy-guy, runs out, jumps into truck, and hightails it out of there, while forklift-guy stays with me until I call police, and they get there. I make a report, gave best description I could, called a coworker to come and stay with me, and the police and forklift-guy leave. 

About an hour later, one of the cops come back in to tell me that they caught the guy speeding on the highway leading out of town. He not only had an empty trailer on back of his truck (he had not been to drop his load, he didn't leave in that direction, and no way did he have time to get to the factory, unload, and get back out to where he was pulled over in that amount of time), but he also had pistol that had been reported stolen in Alabama, AND had just been released from prison, where he had served 2 years for rape, and was wanted in Missouri for not reporting into his probation officer after being released!! I have no clue why he was in a transfer truck, or what the hell he was doing in small town Georgia, but he clearly was making his rounds through the Southeast!

I quit that job within a week! Never worked in a gas station ever again!

1373640496.0	1i5lky	Sister was almost taken years ago at Christmastime	BeachGirl87	228	33	17	"Not very long, but it still creeps me out what could have happened. 

When I was 12 and my sister was 9, we were at a fairly large mall the weekend before Christmas with my mom and grandma. It was insanely crowded, to the point where you almost had to hold hands and make a chain to stay with your group.  My mom would let me go to the mall with my friends alone by this time, so didnt think much about letting us go off on our own and let them finish their shopping. ( this was a long time ago, looking back even my mom can't believe she let us go on our own) 

My sister and I were holding hands, me in front of her and I can just remember her hand slowly slipping, but I just held onto the tip of her finger thinking she was being a brat, and pulled her along. After maybe a good 45 second of this struggle I finally turned around to tell her to smarten up and saw this terrified look on her face. There was an Asian woman, I remember she had very short hair and just no emotion on her face. She was grabbing onto my sisters arm trying to drag her in the opposite direction, but in crowd it was almost impossible to tell what was going on. I grabbed my sisters arm like hell and just pushed through the crowd. The people around us probably thought we were being bad kids in me mall. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1355261007.0	14oowu	Beach Pedo	downforstuff	230	28	34	"Alright guys I just found this reddit and thought I would share my story. It all happend about 10-12 years ago, I don't remember how old I was but probably somewhere between 5 or 6 years old. We used to live in a city right next to the ocean, all this is happening in Germany. So obviously during the summer my family would go to the beach and enjoy ourselves. Me and my best friend Jonas were just exploring the area around the beach and were just being little kids. There was this huge bush that you could go into, it might sound weird but try to imagine a bush about 20-30 feet high, thick sides and hollow on the inside so kids would always go in there and play. Me and my friend went in there and were just joking around fighting with branches and stuff like that. That's when I noticed a shadow outside the bush heading towards the ""entrance"" of the bush. Me and my friend don't think anything about it and just keep playing. The shadow kept walking and eventually raeached the opening. It was a old man maybe 60 years old. He starts smiling and tries to talk to us, we're basically trapped in the bush and start to freak out since we weren't supposed to talk to strangers and here is this old guy trying to talk to us. He asks us stuff like where we are from and where our parents where, that's when my friend lost it and booked it through the bush side, the guys smile changes to an angry scary face and charges me. I follow my friends example and we run to out parents. We told them what happend and they stopped allowing us to go back there. We keep going to the beach for a couple weeks and I could always see the guy in the distance looking at me and my buddy. So fast forward a couple of weeks, there was a huge life-guard building with toilets. My friend goes to pee and I go with him because I want to buy some Ice-Cream. My friend goes to the restrooms which are about 20 feet down the hall from the snack bar. I buy my Ice cream and wait for him, that's when I heard the scream. I run to the bathroom and rip open the door, there is just one stall the door open, the same old guy that has been stalking us is standing in the stalls door. I can see my friend in the stall standing in the corner screaming and crying. That door behind me has shut, the guy sees me and starts yelling and looks like he is about to murder someone. I hurry to open the door and storm out to get help I scream as loud as I can and a couple of lifeguards run over I pointed at the door and they went in. They got the guy and the police was called. Me and my friend had to make statements and my friend was in therapy for a couple of months but is now fine. Turns out the guy was known to be a child molester but the police had no evidence to lock him up till then. Sorry for the rant 
  Edit 1: I have a couple more stories so if you guys would like to hear those too let me know.

1373125318.0	1hr2qj	Talking BDSM to an underage mall employee.	alexandriapro	237	40	47	"I was 16 or 17, working my first job at a store in the mall known for its ""alternative"" music and clothing.  Our job -- besides selling merchandise -- was to be ridiculously friendly, so parents wouldn't be afraid to let their kids shop in the ""scary"" store.  

One day an older man, perhaps in his 60s, came into the store by himself. He wasn't exactly our typical customer, but I don't judge.  He must have looked around, because he started talking to me about how great the store was.  He started talking about specific items from the women's side, asking if I liked them or wore them.  The ones he pointed out were corset-type tops, or had straps all over them (the ""bondage"" style was big at the time).  i kept the conversation going, saying things like ""no that's not exactly my style"" or whatever, just doing my best to stay friendly but not too personal.  I suppose the clothing conversation was his attempt to segue into a conversation about his mistress and BDSM.  He told me specific things that she did to him, such as putting her stiletto heel down his throat.  Again, I was trying not to judge, so I listened... it wasn't until he finally left (to go find his wife!) that I realized how creepy and inappropriate the whole conversation was.

He came in another time i was working and, again, i was friendly and nice and just listened.  He said he was part of this BDSM group, and women were entirely superior to the men in the group.  he said even in terms of a water bottle... a woman could drink from a man's water bottle, but not the other way around.  He said his wife didn't know he did this, but it's OK because she wouldn't do it for him, so of course he'd have to go somewhere else to get it.  At one point he brought his hand up -- I think we were going to shake hands -- and he was visibly shaking, like he was afraid to touch me.  (He ultimately did not touch me, to shake hands or anything else.)  At that point I realized I needed to stay away from him, so I told him I had to get back to work.  He wandered around the store for a little bit, telling my co-workers to tell me things... ""Uh, alexandriapro, that guy said to tell you that Bettie Page became a nun.""  He finally left, and my coworkers and I decided it would be best if I didn't talk to him anymore.

So, the next time he came in I didn't actually see him - a coworker told me he was in the store, and I literally just hid in the backroom until he left.  One of my coworkers told me he asked for me, and said he had a gift for me.  He wouldn't give it to the coworker, he wanted to give it to me directly.  That definitely freaked me out.  Thankfully after that it seems that he never came in again, as I never saw him again and no one ever said that he did.  Of course, at the time I was curious about what ""gift"" he got me, though obviously I'm glad he didn't come back to try to give it to me and I wouldn't have accepted it.  At the time I kind of thought that it might have been something related to his group or the stories he told... maybe a water bottle??  10 years later that seems silly, but that's what I thought at the time.

1371481887.0	1gioyq	Never get into a stranger's SUV in Delhi	acsonbrontion	233	35	59	"This happened a year and a half ago, when I (French male in his early 20's, please excuse my eventual English mistakes) was an exchange student for a year in a university in Delhi. As much as I love India and Delhi, I really did not enjoy Delhi's nightlife, as most of the clubs I had set foot into were filled with sleazy rich men acting really inappropriately with girls, whether Indian or foreign. So after a few tries I decided to stay out of these places and to party with my friends instead, inside our university campus. But that night, me and a dozen of friends from that university went to this nightclub, about 10 minutes from our university, for the birthdays of two of our friends who were into clubbing. The party went well, we danced and drank, and as we were a big group, we managed to keep the wealthy money burning creeps away from our girl friends. 

Fast forward to the end of the night, around 4-5 in the morning. Most of my friends had left before, and I was still there with this girl I used to more or less date at the time, Priya, her friend Mallika, and this other frenchie she was flirting with, Jean. Priya and I were fine and could handle the liquor we had ingested til then, but Mallika was blacked out drunk, she had puked several times and could barely stand on her feet. Jean was drunk as well, and as sweet of a guy he is, he gets cocky and dumb as a brick whenever he has had to much liquor. Me and Priya wanted to head back to the campus by taking a rickshaw, and Priya wanted to go back with Mallika as well, as they were living in the same hostel, and put her to bed. But Jean, who was stupid drunk, came back after helping Mallika find a seat, and said ""There's this guy I met a few weeks back, he has a car and he wants to take us for an afterparty in his farm house in Gurgaon [in the outskirts of Delhi, and farmhouses are usually big villas]"". I said I wanted to go back to the campus, as I was tired, but as Mallika did not object to Jean's offer, so Priya decided to stick with Mallika. I also did not want to leave her alone, as Delhi already had this reputation of not being safe for women at the time, and there were already some stories of women getting raped into moving cars. 

So here we are, heading towards the parking lot, and getting into this big white Japanese SUV, with blaring music and tinted windows. The four of us got into the car, on the back seat, with Mallika near one of the doors in order for her to be able to puke if she needed to. She had  passed out already. The guy in the driver seat starts talking to us, acting extra-friendly. Now, most Indians I had encountered were really friendly, but this was one of those times were you can feel it's forced, and it gets really creepy. He was passing us bottles of Jack D and rum, and I just had bad vibes about him. We were waiting for his friend to arrive. He also said ""if you friend gets sick, open the door and we'll stop, I don't want vomit on my leather seats"". So we wait for a couple of minutes, with Jean chugging on the rum, and the rest of us either passed out or getting a bit paranoid.
 
Then comes the guy's friend; the car starts, and the friend pulls out something shiny out of his belt and put it on the dashboard. I try to get a glimpse of it, and I see it's a gun. Which means the guy was strapped inside the club, and influent enough to elude the compulsory frisking at the entrance. I get more and more worried, and start telling Jean, in french, as calmly as I can ""This guy has a gun""; from where he is, he can't see it, and he does not believe me. Priya can see I'm startled. I ask Jean ""Do you know even these guys' names? Do you have any precise idea where we're heading?"", to which he babbles that he indeed does not know. So I tell the guy in the driver's seat ""Okay please drop us here, we're tired, we'll get a rickshaw back, don't bother"", trying to sound as polite and not stressed as I can. The guy insists on taking us to his place, then Priya tells him ""Why do you have a gun in your car? It is worrying us a bit"", and the second guy takes back the gun and starts waving it saying ""It's for our personal safety, and your safety too"". But this was not really reassuring, as we could see those guys were getting upset with us asking questions, and the guy kept the gun on his lap. The two guys start mumbling to each other in Hindi, and I could only get some of the curse words, but from what Priya told me later they were saying in slang ""Screw it, let's take these fuckers to our place anyway, the chicks are hot, just get them more drunk"". 

Thankfully, we were on this big road which passes in front of our university's gate, which had security guards and usually one policeman posted there to avoid strangers coming onto the campus. As we get closer to the gate, Priya tells the guys in front ""Oh no, Mallika is going to puke, stop, stop!"", even though she was just passed out on the window and had no idea what was happening. These guys, whatever their intentions were, did not want stains on their leather seats, so they stopped 20 meters away from the gate. Jean and I carried Mallika out of the car, while Priya sneaked out and ran towards the guards' posts, told them the guys in the SUV were bothering us, and that they had a gun. So three guards and a cop came out, and started arguing with the guys, who were insulting us. We got in the guards' post and then drove by them to our hostels, while the SUV guys were desperately trying to bribe the cop, but ended up getting detained. Maybe the cop did not want to take the bribe because of so many witness, but we were very thankful to him for standing up for two drunk girls and their foreign friends, instead of two visibly influential men, which is quite unusual in India. This was also the last time I went clubbing in Delhi.

tl;dr : After a night of clubbing in Delhi, we (two guys and two girls) were stupid enough to get lured into a SUV by two rich creeps with a gun. Undirectly saved by them fearing the idea of our friend puking on their leather seat, and a honest policeman. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1368381742.0	1e6z86	"""I'm not sure If I wanna follow her or follow you"""	rositaborracha18	227	30	34	"One afternoon, I was at the park with my friends, and had to leave to go to work. I was 4 blocks away, and only had to walk straight down one street. (I am a 19yo F, 5'4)

As I was walking, a 30 year old ish Arabic looking man who was walking about 2 meters in front turns around and notices me. He stops, waves, and waits for me to catch up on the sidewalk. Now I was aware that he was probably going to hit on me, but the first thing he says is,

""You see that girl in front?"" (About 30 ft in front of us was a young blonde girl walking)
""I'm following her.""

Now I thought he either knew her, or that she had forgotten something at a restaurant, whatever, so I ask him what he's doing, he should go catch up!

""Yeah...but now I'm thinking I wanna follow you instead. I'm not sure anymore if I wanna follow her or follow you""

I wasn't quite sure how to react to this, as no creeper has ever told me he was following me, and no guy has ever hit on me by telling me he would. The only thing I could think of to say is ""you should follow her, I have a boyfriend, bye"". The guys turns right at an intersection, and I keep walking straight.

Next corner, I see the guy coming up on my right again. He did two full turns around the block and came back to me!  He comes up and starts saying ""you know what, we all have boyfriends and girlfriends, its ok"".  I tell him that no, i'm not interested in anyone else, and would like to walk alone. He just trails back and follows me...

Next corner, I turn around and tell him to piss off, and quit trailing. He scampers off to the right, and I think that's that. EXCEPT that he does the run around the block thing again, this time at the intersection where my job is. He follows me again while I walk, and I'm not sure If i should let him see where I work or not. I turn around a final time, and tell him to go away or I'll call the cops. He just asks me for my name. I only reply that I don't give it to strangers, and he suddenly gets very mad, and shocked. He starts yelling out that I'm a racist (called him a stranger), and a whore, etc., before storming off. I had a chance to get into my job without him seeing and before he came back, and I haven't seen him again yet. I hope I don't!

EDIT: After seeing all the comments, I'd just like to specify that it was only around 4 pm, and still very light out and crowded. There was many people and stores along my walk. He couldn't have done any aggressive movement if he wanted to, without attracting attention or have me peace out in a store. I also made sure he wasn't around before I went in my work. It was just still very creepy what he said/him following me and I was afraid that this wouldn't be the only time I'd start seeing him"	t5_2t3t8	True

1369177741.0	1esp16	Waking up	ladylazarus03	227	27	22	"Nearly ten years ago I lived on the upper floor of a town house with my then-boyfriend. There were two apartments upstairs (one being ours) and two downstairs. 

We got a new neighbor across the hall named Jacob. It was clear from the start that he had some mental issues, and according to his family members, he would refuse to take his meds. 

It started tamely enough, with him blasting his music at random hours to drown out the voices he was hearing. Eventually, though, he would accost my bf and I in the hallway and make it hard to pass. He would cut the cable wires in the building because he thought we were spying on him through there, and randomly freak out on us.

Then he started confusing me with an ex-girlfriend of his. Every time I would come home he would stand at the top of the dark stairs saying ""Brenda? Brenda?"" and I would be so scared to go up into my apartment. 

But the worst was one morning I was home alone. I had slept in, soothed by the sound of the rain. I woke up, and directly across from my bed, perched on the roof outside my bedroom window, crouched Jacob, staring in my window in the rain. He was staring so intently right against the glass. I was terrified. 

I called my boyfriend, who called the cops, and it took them nearly two hours to get him to come down from the roof in the rain. We moved soon after that, but I will never forget how terrified I was to wake up to the sight of a crazed man outside the window across from my bed. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1358792000.0	1700ye	creeper cop	NNMR4eva	235	40	51	"Whenever I browse here I am always astounded that so many people have these experiences- and then I remembered my own, and realized pretty much everyone runs into a creeper at some point.
 I was 21 and had just moved from Oregon back to Georgia via a cross-country drive, and being a silly 21 yr old, let my tags expire before switching the registration. Long story short, I get pulled over on my way to work one morning and my car gets impounded. This means I get to wait at the police station while my roommate comes to pick me up and rush me to work (I was managing a salon at the time). 
So, here's a 21 yr old blond chick all dressed up to go to work in a nice salon, standing at the counter in a suburban police station, thinking it's all hilarious. The other officers are all standing around joking with me and giving me advice on how not to be a ditz, and one officer in particular is laying it on pretty thick. This guy is maybe mid-to-late 20's, and really unfortunate looking. We're talking gray (literally GRAY) skin, tragic balding pattern, and eyes and lips that were so fish-like I couldn't look at him without feeling like I was in The Shadow Over Innsmouth. That didn't stop me from being nice to him. I'm a gregarious person even at the worst of times and besides, who the heck is going to antagonize a cop? Anyway, my friend gets me, I go to work, and get my car that evening. Done and done. Right? Wrong!!
 2 days later, I get a phone call from a blocked number. It's the cop from the station, inviting me to a seafood dinner (I shit you not, those were his words). Best part? His name is Lester. Oh, Lester. I tried to let him down easy and made up a boyfriend, to which he replied ""of course you have a boyfriend but I bet he doesn't deserve you. Let me show you how it's done."" Yikes. I gracefully declined again and got off the phone. That's when it dawned on me that this police officer had gone into the computer system and gotten my personal information so he could ask me on a date. I didn't know how to proceed. That's when it got really scary (to me, anyway). 
He started calling my cell phone daily, at least 4 times a day, to ask me out, and then started calling the salon where I worked and hanging up, over and over and over. That's not even the bad part. When I stopped answering his calls and stopped being nice, he started buzzing our house in his cop car. My roommate at the time was not the most law abiding citizen (she sold weed, basically), and this made me even more nervous. All he had to do was get pissed at my rejection and bust us both. Also, this is the state of Georgia, where the cops are particularly sexist and kind of twisted. This guy typified that by acting like every time he called me was the first time. Every message he left was a ""Hey, this is Lester, from the police station?..."" Like he hadn't been harassing me for 2 months. I realize that i probably should have reported this guy, but what are the odds of action being taken against him by the very agency he's a member of? 
 Anyway, eventually, at my parent's request, I ended up moving back in with them for a couple months until darling Lester lost interest and stopped calling and doing the drive-by thing. He did, however, keep calling the salon I was managing for a few months, and would even leave breathing messages on the voicemail when the salon was closed. It would have been comical if I hadn't known he was a cop. I have never trusted the police anyway, but that absolutely ruined it for me. And that's my story of being stalked by an  officer of the law! "	t5_2t3t8	True
1344967141.0	y7pf5	Highway assistance from a serial killer	ravencrowe	239	40	32	"UPDATE: The arrest occurred on July 30, 2012 on a highway in Sturbridge, MA. I've checked the Sturbridge police log but the monthly report for July hasn't been posted yet (it only goes up to May right now) I'll keep checking on that but in the meantime I will keep looking for other articles about it. I mean seriously, with 15 murders there's got to be something written about this guy. My parents are currently contacting their friend to find out the name of the killer.

-----------------------------------

My mom told me this story yesterday. The relationship to the person it happened to is a bit convoluted (the guy was my mom's friend's son's friend, if you can follow that), but the point is that it happened close to someone we know, which makes it seem that much freakier.

I don't know what the boy's name was, but for the sake of the story we'll call him John. John was driving through Sturbridge, MA when he got a flat tire. He pulled over and put his hazard lights on to change the tire. He got it fixed, but by the time he was done his hazard lights had drained the battery, so he was stuck. A car pulled over behind him and a man got out and offered to help. Neither of them had jumper cables, so there was nothing the man could do, yet he didn't leave. He stuck around and started talking to John, asking him some weird questions. The one John most distinctly remembered was him asking what John's religion was. John started to get some creepy vibes off the guy, and he tried to put his car between them. At that point two police cars pulled over behind them. One officer went up to John and forcefully grabbed his arm. He told him to get back in his car, roll up the windows, and lock the doors. It turned out they had run both license plates, and the other man was driving a stolen car. The police grabbed the man and slammed him against his car, then put him in handcuffs- there was an APB out for his arrest. They went around to the back of his car and opened his trunk.

I excitedly said to my mom, ""Was there a body in the trunk?!""
""No, but close,"" she told me. 

When they opened the trunk, they found a tarp. Under the tarp were a bunch of sharp tools, including several pickaxes. My mom described them as dismemberment tools.

""I don't know, with pickaxes it sounds like he could have been trying to break into places,"" I said.
""Right, but it turned out he had killed 15 people.""
""Holy shit.""

TLDR: friend of a friend encounters a serial killer on the highway, probably would have been victim number 16 if the police hadn't shown up.

1343524895.0	xbmq1	"""Gay"" guy on the subway"	tooright	239	42	48	"This just happened to me, and I'm still shaken from it.

I was on a subway platform so that I could transfer to a new line when all of a sudden someone comes up next to me. I was reading so I didn't look up until they got pretty close and I suddenly hear someone speaking.

""I really like your shoes.""

I look up to see a man standing next to me. He'd probably be about 5'5"", and was probably pushing 220 pounds or so. He was a wide guy, to say the least. He was smiling at me and it was pretty unnerving, especially since his teeth were incredibly crooked, but I rolled with it as best as I could, trying to be polite.

""Oh. Thank you.""

He leaned in closer. ""Where did you get them?""

Now, I have black converse. They're *incredibly* common. Just the fact that he approached me on my choice of shoes made me skeptical, but now that he asked me where I bought them, I was immediately on alert. I could tell this guy was up to something. Anyway, I told him where I got them, and he proceeded to talk to me about the book I was reading and about how it was one of his favorites. I was going to say something like ""Oh yeah? Tell me. What's it about?"" But, like I said, I wanted to be polite. But in order to make him get the hint that I didn't want him there, I stuck with one-word answers, thinking that he would maybe get bored with me and back off.

""You're a really nice girl. See, I'm gay, but I *love* girls.""

Now I was on FULL alert. I could tell in no time that he was just saying that to get closer to me (he was assuming 'oh, girls love gay guys, so I'll just say that I'm gay!') so I just nodded and smiled.

""I could be your best gay friend! Ohmygod that would be so cool! Do you like gum? I have some gum, we could blow bubbles together and sit next to each other on the train! Do you have a phone number? I could hit you up sometime and we could have lunch."" He was inching closer and closer to me while he spoke, getting right up in my face, smiling that smile, and I was trying to nonchalantly scoot away.

I was getting more creeped out my the second, so I just said ""I don't give out my phone number."" He started to say that he understood and all (""You can't be too careful, girl, there are a lot of weirdos out there on the streets!"") and suddenly leaned forward and hugged me. This was going TOO FAR, of course, since he was invading my personal space. But I was so taken aback that I stood there for a second, frozen in place. And before I could respond and tell him to get the fuck off, he started to hump my leg.

Yes. He was humping my leg.

I immediately pushed him away and backed up, saying that I didn't want him hugging me and to not come near me.

""Oh, girl, it's ok! I just really like you. I mean, I'm gay, but I just LOVE girls!""

I was so fucking thankful that the train came at that moment, and I started walking for the door. He was calling after me that there wasn't enough room in that train car for us to sit next to each other, but I just kept on walking. I finally just heard him call ""Ok, I'll see you around honey!"" while I boarded the train, and I could see a huge, slimy grin on his face out of the corner of my eye.

I made sure to always check over my shoulder to see if he was following me for the rest of the day, and even cut my trip downtown short so I could get home and shower, because I felt absolutely disgusting.

1371082240.0	1g8fdh	Never shop alone at night	codysgrl10	232	38	34	"I'm kind of new here, but I've been addicted to these stories and thought I would share one that happened to me.

I'm a female and live in a fairly small town. Most of the time I feel pretty safe doing things on my own. I have a house full of kids, so grocery shopping on my own is a rare occurrence for me. One night in particular I was out by myself and headed home semi-late (for me anyway). I was alone, so I called my husband to let him know I was going to run into the store for a couple of things.

 
I get there and because of the time it was pretty empty. Just a few stragglers here and there for a late night snack. I had a recipe in mind for the next day and only needed a few scattered items. As I went down the aisle for the first thing on my list, I passed a man (probably in his 50s) who was shopping alone. I stepped out of his way and smiled, just being polite. Like I said, small town, didn't think much about it, as I do it all the time. My next item was several aisles away, so I got what I needed and carried on. I get to my next item and as I look up, I see the same man again. Not looking at the shelves, but directly at ME. Still wasn't OVERLY concerned, but I thought it was odd. I make my way clear across the store to the dairy section. I had a couple things on my list from this part of the store, so I was there for a few minutes. I look up and there he is again. Looking directly at me. At this point, I'm feeling nervous, so I decide to trust my instincts.

 I went to the main aisle leading to the front and walk straight ahead as if I'm leaving the store. I glance back about halfway to the front and sure enough, there he is. So I keep going, picking up my pace. I get all the way to the front and then decide to grab one last thing, thinking that surely he'll just carry on now, as it would be too obvious to turn around and follow me. I get what I need and look around. Nowhere in sight. I head to the register and breathe a sigh of relief...until I get there.


This store has several ""self checkout"" lanes. I go to one, look up and he's standing at the front of the store. Hasn't checked out yet. He looks as though he's waiting for someone else, which is what I'm hoping. I start to scan my items and then it gets REALLY creepy. He pulls his cart around and goes to the station directly behind me. I have about ten items and he had maybe five. Only the top part of his cart even had anything in it. I'm moving slower now, trying not to panic and hoping he'll just finish and get out!! Then I realize something and I feel relief...all I have is my checkbook. Which means a manager has to check me out because the self checkouts only take cash and cards. I call one over and get her help. Now she has to suspend my entire order and move it to her register and I have to fill out a check. MORE than enough time for this guy to finish what he's doing and be gone. But he manages to slow down and wait until I'm completely done. By this time, I'm visibly shaken and trying to stall until he leaves. He sees  this and leaves by the opposite door, meanwhile watching me the whole way.

 I stayed right where I was and waited for two other families to finish checking out. I put my keys in my hand and all my bags on my arm. As soon as they walk out, I walk right beside them, unlock my car and get in with all my bags. (NO way I was stopping to put the bags in the back!) I immediately lock the doors, look up and see him just getting into his truck the next aisle over, directly in front of me. I start the car and am on the other side of the parking lot before he can even start his truck. I took a long way home in case he saw where I went, but I never saw him after that. I'm just thankful I noticed him when I did and didn't take my sweet time, especially in the parking lot. And also...I don't shop alone at night anymore."	t5_2t3t8	True
1352402765.0	12vdow	"""It's a nice day, isn't it?"""	4myself	224	29	29	" A little background info: I am a 23 year old woman and I don't have my driver’s license so I walk about 2 hours every Wednesday to pick my son up from school, an hour down and an hour back.

This happened a couple weeks ago on the way back from picking him up from school. He just turned 4 and his little legs don't walk very fast, so we were taking our time and learning about the leaves falling from the trees and the correct way to cross the street.  We come up to a corner and I ask him what we do first and he says that we need to look for cars. I praise him and ask if any cars are coming. Without even turning his head he say's nope, no cars and starts to walk out into the street. Grabbing him I pull him back because I see a green Toyota on the corner wanting to turn.  I wave for the car to go on and the guy in the car does the same. Taking my son's hand I walk him across the street. Once across the street I try to explain to him that looking for cars means turning his head in both directions and actually using his eyes to see if cars are coming at him. When I look up, the same green Toyota is still coming in our direction. Now, if there were yellow lines splitting up the road into lanes he would have been in oncoming traffic. He pulls up next to us, as we are still walking and says ""It's a nice day, isn't it?"" I thought it was weird that he didn't turn like he seemed to want to do but answered ""Yes it is"" holding  my sons hand protectively we walked a little faster. The guy pulled off and continued slowly up the street like he was watching us out of one his mirrors till he finally turned. 

After the guy turned I blew it off and continued our walk home. Relaxing and going back to talking with my son about school and what he had learned that day. When we get about five minutes from home the car silently came up from behind us and commented on how long of a walk it is for us and that ""the little boy must be very tired."" I was scared now, almost terrified, that he was going to try and do something to us. He hinted at giving us a ride, to which I said that we didn't live far and that we took this walk often. I took my sons arm and continued walking quickly without looking at the guy, just wanting to get home. I saw the Toyota take off and turn down our street. Then as we were approaching the apartments that we live in, I saw the car driving in and out of the parking lots like he was looking for us and where we might live.   

Somehow, I managed to get me and my son into our apartment building without him seeing. When my husband got home that night we called the police but they didn't seem to take it very seriously although they did send a guy out for a statement.  When the police officer got here I was explaining what the guy looked like and when I said he looked like Costanza from Seinfeld he said he knew exactly who I was talking about. Turns out this guy is mentally disabled and likes to hang out at the Kroger down the street  creeping out the lady cashiers but he's *harmless* they say.  Needless to say I went out that night and got some pepper spray."	t5_2t3t8	True
1376052258.0	1k0t5d	The reason I NEVER forget my gun anymore..	Graboid101	226	33	24	"Before I type out my encounter, I'm going to describe myself so that you can kind of put yourself in my shoes and imagine how helpless I would have been in this situation.
I'm a 22 year old female weighing in at 110 pound, standing 5 foot 3 inches tall. I am fairly petite. My father is a retired police officer so I grew up around guns. I've loved them since the first time I fired one and as soon as I was of age, I went out to get my CHL and a little Taurus Slim. I ALWAYS carry it with me, but on this particular day I'd forgotten it on my dresser.

It was around 11am on a Wednesday morning when I decided to head off to Walmart to pick up a few things for dinner that night. I knew I wouldn't be there long, as I only wanted to purchase a few things.

At first, nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary, but I very suddenly had an urge to speed up my shopping trip and get home. It was a strange, unfamiliar feeling of dread and nervousness, mixed with that uncomfortable feeling you get when someone is staring at you. 
Although the feeling of being watched wasn't something new (I often have to deal with the gawking of creeps), this time was different.
I felt threatened. All of my senses went into overdrive as I scanned my surroundings for danger and I found myself wishing I hadn't left my gun at home. 
After looking around, nothing seemed suspicious. I continued browsing through the aisles trying to remember what I was looking for.  
I'm not too sure how much time had passed because that's what happens at Walmart, but at some point everything felt fine again again.
I was beginning to pick up a box of yogurt when I heard a man's voice from behind me say, ""ma'am?"". I felt my face get hot and my heart jumped. I turned and found myself looking at a police officer and a Walmart employee. Confused, thinking I was about to get accused of shoplifting, I simply replied with a soft, ""yes?"". I was asked to follow them.
I'm not sure every Walmart has this, but at the entrance/exit of this store there is a room with windows and a glass door that are all covered by blinds. On the door is a big sticker of our city's police badge. 
This is the room they lead me to. 
Still confused. I walked in and sat on the chair the officer pointed at. 
There were two other officers inside, as well as another Walmart employee (a manager). 
I literally could not even process what these men eventually told me. I can't remember what was said word-for-word, but I'll summarize. 

Basically, as I was shopping, one of the guys working noticed that there was a really sketchy guy following me. At first he thought maybe the guy was with me, but as he continued watching he noticed the guy would kind of draw back or quickly look at random products on the shelves every time I turned my head in his direction. He definitely knew this guy was a weirdo when he pulled out his phone and started to aim it at me as if to take pictures. The employee finally decided to alert a manager, told him to see for himself and they decided to tell the police working there. 

They asked the guy to go with them and I don't know how they ended up getting this out of him because they didn't go into too much detail about that, but they ended up looking through the picture on his phone, texts and call log. 
He had been sending pictures of me and texts describing me to another person. The texts said things like, ""5'2-5'5, 100+lbs, long black hair, fair skin"" also my estimated bra size, etc. 
Not only that, but he'd apparently had his eye on me from the moment I got there because he had also sent texts describing my truck and where I'd parked. The man he was sending these things to responded by saying, ""looks good"" ""waiting by the truck."" ""Give me heads up""
They asked me if I wanted to see the pictures and texts, but I declined, already feeling sick to my stomach and fucking ANGRY. 
I was taken to the police station where they informed me that the men worked for people in Mexico who ran a human trafficking operation. These guys (and others who worked with them) would hang out at random places looking to fill ""orders"". Once they found a person who fit the description of an ""order"", they'd wait by that person's car, abduct them and eventually get them to Mexico. 

My husband and my dad were filled in and the cops offered to have a couple of cops watch over my house for the night, but since they'd told me the men had most likely not been stalking me for longer than the time I was at the store, I told them I would be okay without. I really just wanted to get the hell home. 

I can't even imagine what my life would be right now if it hadn't been for that walmart employee.

1374554770.0	1iv5rl	Lock your doors	Coyote_Cat	227	34	47	"This happened to me last night. I live in a sketchy neighborhood in an old house with two other roommates. One of my roommates was at work that night and the other was with her boyfriend so I was home alone. Normally I stay up til about 2 or 3 AM, but because I hadn't slept well the night before I crashed at 12 AM. Since our house is old it has a few defects. One of them is the front door which jams when it's locked and it takes forever to unjam it when being unlocked. To avoid this we don't lock the door. This is clearly a stupid practice but my roommate who has lived in this house for five years claims to have never had a problem with anyone breaking in. The other defect is that my house lacks air conditioning so to avoid death by heat stroke I sleep in my underwear.

 At about 2 AM I woke up and noticed a silhouette standing about two feet away from my bed. It appeared to be a man, about six feet tall wearing a hoodie and he was holding a cellphone towards me with the flashlight on. My sleep fogged brain tried to rationalize what was going on. At first I thought maybe my roommate and her boyfriend had come home and needed something from me so I just said ""Hello?"" then I remembered that my roommate's boyfriend was shorter and more slender.

It finally dawned on me that this person obviously wasn't supposed to be in my house and I starting asking, ""Who are you?"" The man remained where he was, still watching me and taking pictures or recording me or whatever the hell he was doing with his phone. I asked him again and starting getting up. The man turned around and briskly walked out of my room and I heard the front door close behind him as I tried to follow him.

By now I was fully awake and freaking out. I frantically called my best friend and told him what happened and he had the friend he was with call the cops while I was on the phone with him. The cops came and took some fingerprints but couldn't really go looking for the the guy since I didn't have a very good description of him They told me to call them if anything else happened and then left.

I didn't sleep until it was light out. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1370817558.0	1g09ux	It started out as a normal crush...	currencyresurrected	241	46	62	"Hey guys, just some information before the story begins. This is a throwaway account, because She who Shall Not Be Named knows my real account. At the time, I was in senior year in high school. I am also male. Let the tales begin!

So I was a normal kid in high school, not extremely popular, not extremely nerdy. I did like to talk to the so-called ""Weird"" kids because I had once been outcast like them and knew how it felt. There was this one girl, we're going to call her Agnes. She was a girl who was classified as ""Weird"". I would always see Agnes walking to classes, eating lunch, that sort of thing all by herself, so I decided that I would walk with her to class one day, thinking, ""What could possibly go wrong!"" Lots of stuff could go wrong. Lots. 

She seemed okay at first, we just talked about how much we hated the teacher in that class (He was a total douche). Then the texts started coming. For about one month, I would get 2 texts every day. One at around 3:30pm, and one at about 7pm.  They would never tell me who they were, they just called themselves ""The masked watcher"" Freaky, right? They knew everything about me. My schedule, my address, when and where all of my classes were, etc. I later found out from her only friend that Agnes was The masked watcher, because her friend had seen the texts she sent. So later that day, I told Agnes that I knew it was her, and if she had really wanted to talk to me she could have just told me it was her and I would be happy to talk. She happily agreed like nothing had ever happened. 

It was about a week later when she started sending texts again. She would say something like hey, or whats up. If i did not reply within a minute she would usually just send a ? or a u ther? she would do this like 10 times over the span of like 2 minutes then just send a text saying, ""FINE JUST IGNORE ME THEN!"". Of course, she would text back about 30 minutes later, rinse later repeat. 

I told her that she was kind of getting on my nerves, and to please stop texting me. Finals were coming up, and I needed to study. She obliged. Instead, she would call me. Every 10 minutes. She would just leave voicemails that ranged from her crying, to screaming, to taking deep breaths, to confessing her love to me. I also got a few death threats from her. 

By this time she was already stalking my twitter, facebook, reddit, basically any thing that I had an account on she was there. She would even send me messages over XBox Live. By this time, I was doing anything I could to get her to stop,  but it just seemed to be getting worse. Sometimes at night I would catch glimpses of her staring into my window, then she would bolt off. And we lived like 30 minutes away. (I know this because in one of her crazed voicemails she gave me her address and told me that she was ""Ready for me"") I started to find letters in the mail that were splattered with blood saying ""I cut for you"", which was also written in blood. (Sadly I would throw them out immediately so I do not have any pictures)

Unfortunately, this does not have a very climactic ending. I went off to university, leaving her behind. (Thank god I am much smarter than her or we could have ended up in the same school.) She even told me that she had applied to the universities that I had. I have blocked her on every social media site that I can, although I still get messages from random reddit accounts that I am sure are her, saying things like, ""Im waiting for you"" or ""You havent escaped me""

Thanks for listening to my story, I hope you enjoyed it. And Agnes, if you are reading this,

**FUCK YOU**
           Sincerely, You know who.

1370449106.0	1fq8q6	After reading through this subreddit, this story definitely belongs here...	gibsonton	228	37	30	"I commented this story in an AskReddit post and was asked to post it here.

Didn't happen to me, but someone I know. 

Friend in her second year of college away from home living in a 1 bedroom apartment by herself. Living alone she was always super conscious of locking her doors and everything. Comes back from class one day and notices that her stuff was not how it was when she left, clothes on the floor, papers rustled, etc and there was a picture on her floor of a little black boy (whom she had never seen before). Enough was out of place that she was way weirded out and she called the police. 

Police come to investigate cant find any evidence of breaking and entering and they ask if they can take her computer. They take it, she's freaked but she tries not to worry about it. 

Next day police show up, bring her the computer and tell her that they found something on it. They open her Microsoft Word and find 100's of letters to her. Weird ass love letters talking about her. Every single one ended the same way, ""If you don't believe me just look under your bed..."" 

No joke, they look under her bed, lift up her mattress to find 100's of used condoms...

Needless to say she noped right outta there and moved back home the next day.

Never found out who it was. Assumed it was someone working maintenance considering doors were always locked and she came home to them locked when the incident occurred. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1342732455.0	wu6le	A neighbor with a grudge	Flying_Clutz	223	27	26	"I posted this in response to another string recently but I thought I'd fix it up and put it here. 

I lived in a 3rd floor flat (apartment takes up the entire floor) of a smallish 4-story building. 1st floor was a Laundromat, 2nd was a socially awkward dude that always reeked of alcohol, upstairs was a pair of sweet little college girls that were pretty quiet. We were all cordial to each other but generally kept to ourselves.  


I'd lived there for a little over a year when the screaming started. It's hard to describe, but at it's worst, the only thing I could imagine was that the guy on the second floor was somehow restrained while somebody was peeling his flesh off. I'm talking high-pitched shrieking, repetitively, for what seemed like hours. Completely unnerving. This was peppered among various roars, screeches, and generalized smashing on the floor/walls/furniture.


There was this lady that would come around to see him from time to time that had multiple scabbed over sores on her face . Sometimes I could hear her voice cooing to him along with the screaming.


I would hear this noise at all hours of the day and night intermittently for about a month. It was completely creepy to come up the stairs and walk down the hallway outside his apartment to the next flight. Sometimes a whole day would go by and it would be quiet. I figured scabby-face was probably a prostitute and/or some sort of drug addict and they were getting high on something ridiculous and/or doing some crazy bondage stuff. 

The smashing on the walls was the way that I got the landlord to care about what was going on. 

The noise was terrifying at times but most frequently just plain annoying. Soon enough, the guy was forcibly evicted. I was out of town when it happened and came home after couple days to find the scabbyfaced chick on the sidewalk by my doorstep asking to borrow my phone. I shot her down and slammed the (automatic locking) exterior building door in her face.

I went out of town again a couple days later, and returned around 8 pm on a Wednesday night. When I opened my building door, there was an odd, sorta medicinal smell in the hallway which got my hackles up. On the 1st landing there was one of those kidney shaped hospital buckets with some linens wadded up in it, a pack of marlboros, and some paperwork.


When I got to my landing, he was standing there waiting for me. He was not happy to see me.

At this point I should explain that I was a 29 year old, 120 lb girl. I'm 5'4"". He was in his earlyish 40s, probably about 5'8"" or so and 180-190 lbs.

""What are YOUUUU Dooing HEEERRRE!?!?"" he screamed at me.
""Going home."" I replied with a calm I was rather proud of. 

Then I continued to head toward my door with my keys out. Not sure why I didn't just turn around, I was kinda operating on autopilot. I reached out with my right arm to put the key in the lock. This is when he exclaimed something like ""Those are MY KEYS,"" and grabbed me.

He wrenched my right arm and threw me into the wall to my right. I slid down a little bit, kicked the wall, dug my left elbow into his sternum and launched off the wall with all my might while roaring at him with a fury I was not aware I had ownership of. I let out a flurry of girly slappy-punchiness into his chest/face/neck area and he staggered backward with what I have to say was a comically stunned look on his face.


Then I made a run for it down the stairs. He stayed at the top. What I didn't know then was my upstairs neighbors heard me screaming and had come down to talk to him and see what the noise was about. What I also didn't know at the time is he had been outside my apartment for over an hour beforehand. He was screaming things like, ""I can hear you in there!"" and pounding on the door for me to come out.  

As I ran, I managed to reach into my purse, grab my phone and dial 911. I yelled my address into the phone and said there was a man in my building and he attacked me. The 911 chick asked me to repeat myself. I had paused partway down the last flight of stairs. This is when I heard him chasing me.


I ran out into the street and remembered that by some awesome bit of luck, my 200lb 6' tall friend was in the process of moving in down the street so I kept running toward his apartment screaming his name. He was moving a couch with another friend. I'll never forget the relief I felt watching his head snap around to look at me as he dropped the couch in the middle of the street.   They both immediately started running toward me. My attacker was still chasing me in the street, saw those two guys, turned tail and ran back into the building and stood on the inside of the building door, yelling nonsense through the window.  

My friends stuck around to keep him trapped there until the cops came. 

Soon enough the police arrived. I had also called my landlord, he and his daughter showed up too. The crazy neighbor dude was completely incoherent. I assume on some sort of psychotic break. He kept saying that we were in a relationship that we lived together and had just had a spat. He kept calling me by some other name that was not mine. My landlord corroborated the story that he'd been evicted and that he and I were not in a relationship. The cops took him away and locked him up. 

My right arm was raw and abraded where he had wrenched it, my elbows and arms were bruised, my back was wrenched and there were bruises down my right shoulder and my back. I didn't feel a thing until almost an hour later. When he threw me into the wall, it honestly felt like floating into pillows.


It turns out the maintenance guy that threw him out replaced his apartment lock, but not the front door of the building. He still had the key the exterior door of my building. Many prompted me to sue, but I’m just not a litigious person.


The next day the cops came back to investigate the crazy dude's police brutality claim. He was trying to say that the injuries he sustained from my flailing fists were from the cops. Apparently I bruised the crap out of his chest.


I was given a 4-year restraining order against him. He spent 3 months locked in the jail's insane asylum and they let him out. I assume he went off his meds, went nuts and they let him out once he stabilized. I've moved out of that neighborhood but did see him a couple times on the street. We just avoided each other and it's been years since the last time I saw him.

This all happened just a few months before my 30th birthday, which was the happiest birthday of my life. To this day I always say to people that are moaning about getting older that you just need a crazy person to wait for you in a stairwell and attack you.

After that you'll celebrate every stinking birthday you get. At least I still do, now 6 years later.

**edit** grammar.

1342423974.0	wmu5o	Runescape and Fat Guy	The9thAccount	228	33	68	"It all started out in the early years of the MMORPG Runescape. Now if you don't know what Runescape is, I suggest you search it up now. Once the most popular MMO to hit the interwebs until WoW took over.

Now before 2005, my family had used the old dial-up method of internet use and weren't expecting to change anytime soon. This annoyed me a lot. Being a 11 year old kid and having beyond turtle slow internet was killing me. I would need to wait 1 or 2 hours for a 5 minute youtube clip to buffer and I could download a 1GB movie in about 4 days. Yep, life sucked for me. 

Fortunately, I lived very close to a big shopping complex and in the shopping complex was a gaming cafe. The first time I saw the gaming cafe, my brain immediately told me to visit there some time in the future. And that's what I did. It was a school break and my parents were still working during weekdays so I would ask my older sister for a bit of spare cash and head down to the cafe, which was probably only a 10 minute walk from my front door. 

I remember my jaw dropping as I stepped into the cafe. It was dark, had cool blue neons lighting up the corners of the big room and rows and rows of widescreen computers set neatly. I initially stayed only for 30 minutes each couple of days, browsing youtube clips and playing the simplest of flash games. Until I found out a game called Runescape, which a couple of guys were playing in the corner. I quickly learnt about the game and finally decided to try it myself. Oh what bliss. The internet was fast, the screen was wide and the room was dark. What more could an obnoxious 11 year old kid want? 

I was fascinated about the lore and the mechanics of the game. How could I have not heard it before? How amazing it was to be a virtual man in a virtual world! I realised that time was coming by faster and faster and I was asking for more and more spare change from my sister. It's funny how she never found it odd... 

One particular day, I was at the cafe and I waltz over to my usual spot (far corner, I thought it had the fastest computer haha) and there's this obese guy sitting next to my favourite spot. At least he didn't take my computer. But then I realised that he was playing Runescape and was actually quite pro at it. I sit next to him and I boot up the computer and go straight to Runescape like usual. I'm determined to show off my character and my wealth in this game and he seems to notice. I admit, I was decent at that time (average player) and this seemed to piss him off. This obese guy in his 20's seems to be pissed off that I have such a ""newb"" account on Runescape and is determined to show off his account, which I admit at the time was admirable. Everytime I looked at his screen, he'd mutter under his breath things like ""mind your own"" and ""do you mind?"". I didn't seem to be concerned at his weird behavior but I guess I was 11 years old at that time so I'm excused. 

As time goes on (as in weeks and months), I was probably at the same level as this guy. This set him off pretty hard. He would always ask the guy at the counter if I could be banned from coming to this cafe. Obviously, the guy asked for a reason and this fatso didn't come up with anything viable. So I'm pretty upset so I try and move and just as I'm standing up, the guy screams something like ""This f***ing kid is trying to steal my skittles!"". What an asshole I thought. The guy at the desk comes to the scuffle and he tells me to move somewhere else. I agree and this obese guy is still giving me dirties. 

Skip ahead, 2 weeks later, I'm back again and the fat guy is sitting in his spot as usual. I try to avoid eye contact but I can feel his eyes glazed on me everywhere I go. So I sit at my new favourite spot and I log into Runescape. Well this was the age in Runescape where you could add anyone onto your friends list without the other players consent. I knew this because the mean fat guy from across the room is sending me IM's in Runescape telling me to change servers (I always played in the same server since my friends all did too, it was like an unofficial school friends server) and I don't reply because I don't have his name on my friends list. This goes on for ages, and I never stopped to think how awkward it was for him to be cussing me out in a game, from across the room. 
I would have reported him if he used bad language but he never did, and I think he knew his limits, at least in the pixel world. 

Suddenly one day out of nowhere, this fat idiot asks me to go into the Wilderness (kinda like a pvp part of the world) to help him kill something in-game. I'm not a dumbass, atleast not in RS. Now for you guys/girls who don't know about PvP in Runescape, if you die to someone else, you lose all your stuff in your bag. So basically, this idiot thinks he can trick me into going into the Wilderness with him and then lure me far enough to kill me and claim his title and pride. Well all I can remember was that our in-game level differences were very little and I spent my time in-game doing quests/grinding while the fat man sat in-game doing irrelevant things, which explains why I had caught up within a few months of starting.
Back to the cafe, I agree and I can feel the tension between us. This idiot also tells me to wear my best armour and weapons (""incase we die to zombies""). Prior to this, I tell one of my friends Chris to follow us at a distance so I can get my revenge my jumping the fatso with the help of Chris and ultimately get his stuff. The fat guy notices that a random guy (Chris) is following us and potentially ruining his scheme (""he tells Chris to get lost in-game"") and tries to make me change servers so we can shake my friend off. Then I make up a brilliant plan. I tell the fat idiot to lure my friend Chris deep into the Wildy so we can jump him instead (opposite). Just to tell you folks, we are all private IMing in-game so neither can see what we type to either people.
On with the plan, the fat guy agrees (but Chris and I know he'll end up killing me after anyways). By the way, the fatso doesn't know I have a connection with Chris so the idiot thinks that Chris is just a tag along random. 
We go finally reach the wilderness and we go heaps far into the wilderness and I remember we were lost in and I tell Chris to ask the mean guy if ""they"" wanna jump me instead. Chris asks. Immediately, the fat guy agrees and I can hear him laughing in the cafe. The idiot strikes me first (which means he will lose ALL items since he is the one starting the duel). I snicker and I tell Chris to jump him. We end up killing the guy and I'm picking up his stuff when the fat idiot is getting out of his seat to come and eat me. I quickly log off, run under the tables and out of the cafe (prepaid cafe btw) and I sprinted for my life. 

Skip ahead to 1 year later, our house finally has broadband hooked up and my sister bought a nice laptop which she shared with me. I had not touched Runescape in for exactly 1 year and I logged on to see what it was like (I had lost interest in Runescape) and I'm just trying out some new features when I get a private IM from Fatty in the cafe.

""You are lucky you didn't come back"". I remember this vividly. I didn't reply and I tried to ignore him.
""I wish I could kill you in real life"", was the next thing he said, after I didn't reply.
I immediately filed a report on him to Jagex and he was banned a week later, information came through my email. 

I can't imagine what would happen if I went back to the cafe. Or if he saw me eating with my parents at the food court.

MY NOTE:

To all people who are offended by the term fat, no offence. Seriously.

This guy's name needed to be called Fat. He was obese but had issues.

I was in a car packed with people, and we were following another couple of cars from one house to another (we were going from house party to house party or something, this was in high school.)

We are following our friend down the highway who was leading the way,  quite a few cars were around us. We get off at an exit and drive through the neighbourhood we are going to. We follow our friend's car, and they started turning at every possible sidestreet, increasing their speed and flying around corners faster and faster as we continue. At this point, we're wondering if our friend knows where the hell they're going, or if they're trying to be an asshole and lose us.

After a few minutes (that must have been pretty harrowing for the other driver) we realized we had been following a car SIMILAR to our friend's, but it wasn't our actual friend's car. We had just managed to chase down another car, and made them think we were creepily following them through this neighbourhood (it was pitch black out at this point, too).

For many years, I spent my summers working in a major southern US city with a moderately high crime rate and some serious racial conflict. Now, I grew up in NYC and live there to this day, and I'm not overly afraid of walking around in some of my city's more infamous areas at night, but I think it's important to respect the city you're in, and I knew that this southern city was quite a bit more dangerous for me to walk around alone in, especially as a young petite woman (5'0"", 105lbs; I'm pretty strong, a lot stronger than people think by looking at me, but I know better than to think I would do too well in a one-on-one fight). To be honest, in my summer city, I wouldn't usually even walk home alone after work, since I worked until 10pm or later - even though it was only a 10 minute walk. It seemed silly to ask someone for a ride when it was a lovely and short walk through a gorgeous city - but I also just knew that I didn't feel SAFE; it wasn't even the caution I have sometimes felt in a crummy neighborhood back home but just a totally different feeling: a complete inability to be confidently safe. I loved my summers there, but I avoided being alone after dark at all costs.

But as often happens, we make little compromises. It was midnight and the only other person in the office was staying for another couple hours while one of the events we were managing wound down. He asked if I wanted him to drive me home, but I knew that this would mean locking the entire building up, driving like two minutes, then two minutes back, and then disarming the security system again, etc, and I just felt...silly. Like a scared little girl. So I said, ""Nah, I'll be okay, I only live a few blocks away."" And I went on my merry way.

I walked with my head up, my strides sure, my ears open, just like I do back home. I got one block, and then another. It was a gorgeous night and I let myself enjoy it and relax a little bit, as I hoped in vain for a gentle breeze to cool me off a little, and enjoyed the symphony of the various insects that came out at night. It was ungodly humid and I didn't see a single other person - definitely a different type of city than NYC - but I could hear the gentle hum of nightlife from the main drag one avenue over. I got a third block. And then I saw another person.

A man. 

""Of course,"" I thought to myself as my anxiety ratcheted up, and I instantly admonished myself for my bias. I was out walking alone at night, after all; why didn't a man have the same right? But - and this has never happened to me before or since - something about the sight of that man, THAT specific man, terrified me.

I couldn't tell you why. He was in his mid-20s, and had long shaggy hair; as the moonlight reflected off of him I could see it was blond. Everything about him struck me as just sort of an anomaly. I don't mean to made such judgments, but at that time of night, most of the white people are in bed, or in groups heading to or from the bar together (of course, then again, I'm white too, so...). He looked like a surfer, not a stalker. He actually looked pretty cute - and yet I could hardly bear to look at him, because looking at him filled me with fear and apprehension. I know that you can never tell, but it really just struck me - how much this guy DID NOT look like the sort of guy who would terrify me, and yet how absolutely terrified he made me feel, for reasons I couldn't articulate. There was nothing objectively scary about him and yet I just felt this sickening dread as we slowly, slowly approached each other. It wasn't just that I was alone at night. I didn't know what it was. But I knew he scared me.

He was walking towards me, and I had to walk towards him to get home. We got closer; he got bigger and bigger as he approached, and I felt smaller and smaller as I approached him. Maybe a minute passed. Soon we were on the same block. I willed myself to just get past him and get it over with, and yet when I was about 20' away from him, I stopped. I don't know why. I just really, really didn't want to walk past him. It almost felt like I couldn't make myself go any closer.

""This is ridiculous,"" I thought to myself, and I even began to blush in the dark summer night, embarrassed by my behavior. But, just to ease my mind, I crossed the street, feeling foolish. 

And then, he crossed the street.

""Don't come any closer to me,"" I said loudly, without even meaning to. It just came out of me. It surprised me - how complete it was, how it was exactly what I felt and exactly what I wanted most in the world at that moment, translated into words: DON'T COME ANY CLOSER TO ME. How it was a command, not a request. DON'T. I had never heard myself sound so sure of anything before in my life, honestly. My voice was the first real sound I'd heard in several minutes and I was surprised at how loud it felt, breaking the tension and finally starting ""this"" - whatever ""this"" was. He looked like it startled him, too.

""Don't be scared,"" he said after a moment, though he did stop walking towards me.

""I'm not scared,"" I said, ""I just don't want you near me."" We stood there for a moment at an impasse, looking at each other.

""Please,"" he said. ""I got mugged; someone stole my wallet and my phone. I don't have any money and I need to call someone to come get me.""

""There's a gas station one block over, on that avenue right there,"" I pointed to the right of us. ""They have a phone.""

""I'm not from here and I had too much to drink and I don't want to get lost,"" he said. I surprised myself with all the red flags I noticed as soon as they went up: his clear and sober-sounding speech; his local-sounding accent; the fact that I was the first to speak, the one to initiate the dialogue, when if he was the one who needed help you'd think he would have said something first; the weirdness of someone going out alone and getting drunk on their own in a strange city, instead of hanging out with friends or drinking moderately or anything like that. I know it's not impossible - I've traveled alone myself and enjoyed my own company in plenty of bars - but it all just seemed like a bunch of relatively less-than-common stuff, and all taken together, it made me wary. He continued, ""Will you walk to the gas station with me? Or can I borrow your phone?""

""No,"" I said. ""You should turn right, and walk until you come to the next intersection, and you'll be at a very busy road with a gas station on your lefthand side."" 

""Please, help me,"" he said. ""I'm not going to hurt you. I just need help."" He started walking again. Towards me. Slow, like how you approach a cat. ""Seriously, what's wrong with you? I just need HELP.""

I thought of my Leatherman and my flick knife, both of which I use regularly for work; both of which were buried somewhere in the bottom of my hellishly messy purse. My fingers twitched with longing but I didn't want to be distracted, so I didn't start fumbling around for them.

""I told you,"" I said, raising my voice, ""don't come closer to me."" I stepped backwards and hated myself for doing it; it felt like a sort of mini-surrender. He took another step forwards.

""I won't hurt you,"" he said. 

I began crossing the empty street again, walking backwards at first just to keep my eyes on him, and I said, ""I'll scream. There is a cop who is stationed on a bike four blocks away. He's there every night, and he will hear me scream. He will be here in seconds. You really should turn right at this corner; it will take you directly to the gas station.""

""If you say so,"" he said, and I felt the distinct and chilling question within myself, of whether, in his ambiguity, he was referring to the location of the gas station or location of the police officer. He didn't start walking. I stood there, on the other side of the street, wary of taking my eyes off him. But he didn't start walking.

So I did. I walked until we were directly across the street from each other and then I walked further. I glanced at him over my shoulder after a few steps and he was still there, watching me. Going nowhere. Just watching me.

I walked a few more steps and glanced over my shoulder at him again. He was still standing there. I picked up the pace and went a ways further. Looked back. He was gone. Completely gone. He had to have moved quickly, a lot quicker than he'd been moving before when he was walking towards me, to reach that intersection and turn right towards the gas station in just those few steps. I couldn't stop wondering: where else could he have gone, moving that quickly, without me watching? I didn't think he could have crossed the whole street AND managed to hide somewhere, at least not without me hearing. I glanced at the sidewalk across from me. It was lined with trees and bushes; there were massive gardens all along it, all kinds of yards and stuff like that; there were almost no streetlights, and so many shadows. He could be anywhere. 

I thought about turning down a side street and heading towards the main drag where all the bars and restaurants were. I glanced down one as I passed. No streetlights at all, just sleepy silent buildings all empty for the night, and the bright lights of the next avenue seemed impossibly far away. I kept going straight. And I tried to tell myself to calm the fuck down. He was just someone out walking alone, just like I was - nothing more. I even managed to work up some guilt over not doing more to help him. I like to think of myself as a good person and it bothered me that I had been so rude to someone who really might have needed help. But at the same time, I just couldn't quite make myself relax about it. 

I wanted to run, but I desperately didn't want to run. Maybe it's just a leftover superstition from childhood, but somehow I felt that a chase never truly begins until you start running. So I walked. Quickly. I looked back. I saw shadows. So many shadows. I walked quicker. I looked back again. Nothing but shadows. I willed myself to calm down but I couldn't make it happen.

Finally, I approached the block where the cop on the bicycle was always waiting behind a few trees. With that grove in sight, I broke into a run. The chase was finally on, if it ever would be. I sprinted, and then as my panic grew I pushed even faster down that last block. 

The cop heard me running his way before he really saw me. ""Are you okay, miss?"" he asked as I approached him, still largely shrouded by the shadows of the trees around him, straddling his bike, peering out at me.

""Yes,"" I replied, feeling silly immediately. ""I'm fine, sorry. I just got scared."" I smiled an apology and began to make fun of myself, the way we so often do when we feel stupid, but the cop was already looking behind me, over my shoulder.

""Sir?"" he called, loudly, finally coming out of the shadows so he could be fully seen. ""Can I help you with anything?""

""No thanks,"" I heard a voice say. I turned around and there was the man, maybe 30' behind me. Just staring, looking.

I can only think that he followed me after all, slinking along in the shadows; that he walked when I walked, and eventually he ran when I ran, to keep up, even though full-on running meant abandoning his ""cover."" 

""Do you know him?"" the cop asked.

""No,"" I said quietly. ""He told me he got mugged and he wanted me to help him, but I was scared so I didn't. I didn't help him."" Even in that moment, I felt a twinge of guilt.

I waited for the man to come closer, to tell the cop that he had been mugged, that he needed a phone; to prove that I was the horrible person in this situation, not him. He said nothing. He waved, then turned around and started walking the other way. He didn't look back. I waited with the police officer and we watched him walk for several minutes, and then I asked the cop to escort me to my home a block away. When we got to my front door, the cop asked me if I was okay, or if I wanted to make a formal statement. I couldn't really think of what I would even say - I was out walking alone and I saw another person out walking alone and I yelled at him when he asked me for help? and then he followed me? and all I really know is he was blond? - and I was a bit shocked and stunned, so I said no, and thanked him for helping me get home safely. I went inside and used my flashlight to get to bed, too scared to turn on the lights for fear that they would render me visible from the street. 

It wasn't until I was already laying down, sweltering in my un-air-conditioned bedroom because I couldn't bear to open the windows, that I found myself wondering: if I hadn't run, if HE hadn't been forced to run and thus abandon the silent but uneven cover of the shadows and trees, would the police officer have seen him at all? Or would he have remained hidden, watching me, following me right up to my very doorstep, lurking in my own bushes as I climbed the stairs to the porch and fought to get the key in the lock? Would I have waved to the cop bravely, speed-walking my way home, willing myself not to run, with that man slithering behind me the whole time, unseen by either of us?

And if so, what then? "	t5_2t3t8	True
1370661339.0	1fwo1v	This happened to a lady friend of mine. Weird as hell.	illmindedjunkie	231	38	65	"Glad to have found this subreddit. Figured that this story would be perfect here.

Not sure if this consists as stalking, but I certainly did find it a very creepy approach to picking someone up.

One of my friends met up with a group of us at a bowling alley for a friend's birthday. She had to drive from her parents' house, who live about 30 miles or so from the bowling alley (yep... she's hella cool for driving so far!). The store where she ordered the cake was down the street from her parents, so once she got underway towards the party, she stopped by the store to pick it up.

There were a lot of people at the store, so she had to wait patiently in line to get the cake, and once she paid for it, she went on her way. She arrived at the bowling alley about 45 minutes later, and good times were had by all. 

After several hours of hanging out, bowling and drinking beer and sobering up eating pizza and birthday cake, the bowling alley closed and we all had to bounce. We all collected our shoes and went outside to plan where to go next.

Once we were outside, we all walked to our cars (our cars were parked close together) and decided hat we'd all go barhopping. That's when we noticed that there was a piece of paper on the windshield of her car. We all thought it was a ticket.

But it wasn't.

Turns out, it was a receipt from the store where she had picked up the cake earlier, 30-odd miles away. On the back of the receipt was a note written by a man, which simply stated (and I remember reading it over and over, I was so creeped out by the whole thing): 

""Saw you in line. You are so fucking gorgeous. Didn't have an opportunity to talk to you so I followed you. You drive fast! I'd like to buy you a drink. Email me (email address). Hope you have a beautiful night! XOXO Ps. You have perfect feet."""	t5_2t3t8	True
1365415717.0	1bwqte	So now I try not to scream.	Sproose_Moose	239	46	18	"When I was 13, my sister and I were home alone while my mum was at work. The sun was just about set, so it was pretty dark when we were in our backyard taking clothes off the line. While doing so, a toad jumped on my foot and I gave out a huge scream because I am petrified of those things. My sister scolded me for making so much noise, we finished up then went inside. A few minutes later we could hear someone calling us from out the front. We lived in a block of 3 units, with a carport out the front of our house, and a large green mesh screen separating us from the other houses. 

There was a man standing behind the mesh and he was asking if everything was alright. I went out the front and he asks again if everything was ok because he heard screams. I tell him what happened and he says he laughs and then starts asking me questions about whether there were any adults home. I tell him that my mum was at work, and he gets a weird look on his face. He then starts asking me questions about my family, and whether I've ever tried to kill them. He looks at my shirt, I'm wearing a casper the ghost shirt, and he says that casper had shot his family. I'm obviously feeling really uneasy at this point, and he tells me that I should put poison in my family's salad. I look over at my sister, she is standing at the kitchen window out of his line of sight and is holding a knife. That's when I start to feel sick, knowing if my older sister was that worried then something was really wrong. I then look at his hands and through the mesh I can see he is holding something shiny, and he has a demented grin on his face. I tell him that I have to go inside, and he doesn't say anything. I go in, we call the police and my mum and within a few minutes they arrive, and the man is gone. A few days later we saw the same man wandering a few streets over, carrying a sack and a little bag. Thankfully we didn't see him again after that."	t5_2t3t8	True
1342626942.0	wrirs	Bad vibe from teacher	ThedarkRose20	232	38	34	"I read a story today about someone's creepy teacher and his lewd actions towards them. This reminded me of my teacher from ninth grade. Mr Gorry was an English teacher at Davies Technical Highschool, who set off quickly at the begining of the year. He gave us tons of work to do to keep us occupied, mostly note copying. From about the first month into school, I knew something was off about him. He once referred to a scenario (after reading out loud a story by edgar allen poe) where he was a serial killer and he picked girls out of the class who had natural blond highlights in their hair to demonstrate how a murdered chooses his victims. I was one of the few girls he chose, which I found odd because I had dark brown hair.
I always got creepy feelings around him. Because of these feelings, and a few other reasons, I transfered to my local high school halfway through the year. It turns out I made the right move. Last year one of my friends came up to me and told me that Gorry was arrested for possession of child porn on his computer and having relations with a 16 year old student. I found the article here http://www.wpri.com/dpp/news/local_news/west_bay/coventry-teacher-arrested-on-child-porn-charges

1374922998.0	1j5lrz	"""We're so perfect when we dont fight"""	confused_14	231	42	17	"So I've had my fair share of creepy encounters throughout my 18 years of living, this is one of the more recent ones that occurred a few months ago.
I was on the bus on my way back from school, going to my dentist appointment. It was in the middle of a snowstorm so the buses were a little more crowded than usual. I was sitting near the back, dozing off a bit, and out of the corner of my eye I noticed a middle aged woman standing up and moving out of her seat to sit next to me. Nothing too weird. About 2 seconds later, a man (who somewhat resembled Russell Crowe when he played John Nash in a Beautiful Mind) followed quickly after her and sat in front of her. He kept talking to the woman but I assumed they were friends. About two seconds later she stood up and yelled ""I DON'T KNOW YOU. LEAVE ME ALONE."" and moved back to her original spot. I wasn't sure what was going on, but the man stared at me and I got chills down my spine, I shrugged it off as paranoia. I pulled out my phone so I'd look busy and unapproachable, and he got up and followed the woman. I was kind of relieved he didn't talk to me, but still felt nervous for the woman. When it was my stop, I noticed the woman had already gotten off, but the man was still onboard. I stepped off the bus, and the man looked over, and quickly ran off right after me. 
This really freaked me out because it was a snowstorm, so not many people were outside and the roads were pretty empty too. However, I just had to cross the street, and I'd be at my dentist's office so I wasn't too worried. I was waiting for the light to turn green so I could cross, when out of the corner of my eye, I see him smiling at me. And this is when I nearly cried.
""Hey."" he says, ""Um hi."" I respond, eyes still fixated ahead of me. 
""Don't you think it would be so much better if we just got along instead of all this...fighting?"" he said, his face almost up against mine now. I almost shat myself, but I  just said ""sorry, what?"" and he responds, ""We should really just stop fighting and get along. We're so perfect when we don't fight. I don't know why you don't see that."" I was frozen, and the damn signal light wouldn't change so I couldn't move. I just started inching away. ""Why don't we go somewhere and talk it out, you know? We should just get along instead of all this..fighting."" he repeated.
Needless to say, the second the signal turned green I just RAN. I didn't respond, I didn't look back, nor did I want to. About 30 seconds of running, I looked back reluctantly and saw him still standing at the street light, but he wasn't looking at me.
I know he most likely had a mental problem of some sort because he was saying the same thing to the lady on the bus, but his face and creepy voice are still burnt into my mind, he had a bag with him too and I'm so glad he never reached in or tried to grab me.
I told a bunch of my friends and my sister later, but they all kind of laughed it off. I never saw him on the bus again and I hope I never do."	t5_2t3t8	True
1364595090.0	1b9omb	Cousin Jimmy	dangnematodes	219	24	28	"The first friend I ever made was this girl named Jade. We met the day before Kindergarten and had the good fortune of getting the same teacher. We were more or less attached at the hip until the end of the 3rd grade. My great grandmother had passed that January, and my mother wanted to buy and restore her gorgeous 1850's farmhouse. So she did, and we moved in that August.


Being a kid with two working parents, like hers, we didn't get to see much of each other after that, only the occasional birthday party. After 2 years, we sort of stopped talking altogether out of mutual busyness. 
Another 2 years after that, the day after my 13th birthday, Jade, her older brother(who had just gotten his license and a car), and her brother's lady friend showed up at my house to surprise me. They took me out for pizza, we went to the mall, I was overjoyed when my mom gave me permission to stay the night at her house. 


So we're on our way home, catching up and talking about 13 year old girl stuff, when Jade's mom calls her brother. They talk briefly, he hangs up and tells Jade that she must've forgotten that it was their weekend to have cousin Jimmy over. The look of horror on Jade's face is not something I'll ever forget. She looks at me, and she looks like she's going to cry.


""Oh gosh, dangnematodes, I am so sorry...""


I didn't understand. I'd met Jimmy when we were much younger. I told him he was going to marry a boy once, and he sat right on my head and farted. He was always a little... weird. I'm positive it's a mental thing, but he wasn't murderous or anything like that. I said it was no big deal, it wouldn't spoil our time or anything, she tells me I really don't get it. On the way to pick him up, she filled me in what he was like then. 


Apparently, Jimmy had grown into somewhat of a weirdo, putting it politely. He'd taken an interest in dead things, and unfortunately, girls. She'd started by telling me that she'd found quite a few pairs of her panties in his room at her grandmother's(where Jimmy lived), as well as some dead rats and birds. That he'd walk in on her when she was in the shower and play it off as an accident, shit like that. Then she told me that it'd gotten worse recently, that he'd assaulted her once before and her brother had to pull him off of her. She said he didn't get any further than groping, which was good, but another one of her friends hadn't been so lucky. 


As it was told to me, her friend Renee was staying over and Jade was in the shower when Jimmy went into Jade's room to lock himself and Renee in. Upon hearing screaming from her room, her brother had to take down the door to get in there to get him off of her. Jade told me it took 4 months to get Renee to tell her what had happened, he had ripped her underwear off was trying to, well, get it in when her brother had busted down the door.


Needless to say, I was scared shitless. I wasn't about to let her know that, though. She asked if I wanted them to take me home, but I put on my brave face and told her that I'd be fine. 


We get to the house to pick up Jimmy, and of course, he insists on sitting next to me in the car. He starts complimenting me on my studded bracelets and makeup(7th grade goth phase, y'know), nothing *too* creepy, but enough to make me extremely uncomfortable. So we roll up to her house, her mother greets us, asks how things have been, yadda yadda. We decided to sit outside, away from Jimmy, and talk for a bit. Half an hour or so passes, out comes Jimmy, again, insisting to sit next to me. He'd scoot closer, and I'd move my chair further, and that continued until Jade noticed it and decided to go inside. By the time we got in, her mother told us it was late and that Jimmy needed to go to bed, but Jade and I could stay up and watch movies in her room as long as we kept quiet and didn't wake her dad up. Her brother had left to take his girlfriend home and decided to stay there for the night. 


We ended up watching Harry Potter, she told me about her enormous fandom of Daniel Radcliffe, we talked about boys we liked, the norm. When it came time to lie down, I asked her if we could lock her door, and she tells me the locks broken from the incident with Renee. So I died a little inside and attempted to swallow my fear, and lied down. I didn't sleep. About 3am, I hear a door open down the hall. A few seconds later, Jimmy slowly and quietly opens the door. He stood there for close to a fucking half hour. Then, he started moving in. I sprung to my feet and very loudly asked him what he thought he was doing. Jade sat up and told him to get out of her room, that she was going to get her mom, things along those lines, and he turned and left without saying a word. 


Fast forward a few sleepless hours, her mother is up and getting ready for church, and tells us we don't have to go. That unfortunately went for Jimmy as well, which we didn't realize until after we'd told her we'd just stay there. So her mother leaves, and Jade asks if I want to get a shower. After she'd told me of her experience with Jimmy 'accidentally' walking in on her, I politely decline, and she says I can do whatever while she gets one. So, I shut myself in her room, and start doing my hair/make-up. A few minutes later, Jimmy opens the door and stands in the doorway. 


He starts telling me how pretty he thinks I am, how the whole 'dark' look on girls is irresistible to him, that no girls at his school dress like me and that he thinks I'm the perfect female specimen. Not knowing what to do, I just kept at my makeup and try to acknowledge him as little as possible. 


At this point, I realize he's completely blocking the doorway. Standing with his arms out. He's not a little guy. So I stand up and ask him to move. He holds steady. Then he tried to grab me by the arm. It was about a minute and a half of dancing around the room, me trying to dodge him and him coming at me, I jumped up on the bed and jumped off the other side and darted to her parents bathroom and locked myself in. He didn't follow me in there. 


After 15 minutes, Jade got out of the shower and started yelling for me, and I yelled for her to come and get me and told her what happened. She cried. I'd never seen her so upset. She apologized profusely, but I assured her it wasn't a big deal and not to be so upset about it, though it was one of the scariest things that has ever happened to me and I think of it often. 


It was a long time before I went back to see her, and I haven't seen cousin Jimmy since then. Though I did find some graffiti at this abandoned high school in the town they live in, proclaiming him a 'fucking freak'. I'll drink to that. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1355942747.0	154d4d	Nearly kidnapped at a funeral; thank god for the angry mob of relatives	pohutukawa	236	47	36	"This is my first time posting on anything ever, so please forgive me for any mistakes made. I actually didn't think of this until today despite having lurked around LetsNotMeet for days... I only think of it once in a while, usually when I meet these 2 cousins at gatherings. So here goes: 

I am female, grew up in Singapore. This happened years ago when I was 8 (I think). I was attending my oldest paternal uncle's funeral. Just a little background info for those unfamiliar, Chinese Buddhist funerals are typically held at the [void deck](http://www.stproperty.sg/articles-property/upload/article/47440__1328668777.jpg) of the deceased's flat and there is usually at least one [playground](http://memory.singaporeshots.com/albums/userpics/10003/normal_Neighbourhood-Children-Playground.jpg) in among all these flats. (See that flat behind the playground?) Funerals are, obviously, a couple days long. This isn't incredibly creepy, but it was really close. 

Being the closest of age, 8 year old me, my 7 year old cousin, and her 6 year old brother hung out together during the course of the wake. Being stupid, insensitive little snot rags, we would play noisily during the funeral and generally be stupid, insensitive little snot rags. We eventually got bored. Seeing as how there was a playground right next to the funeral, we cleverly decided to head there. At night. 

So we were playing, having fun and shit, and this guy approaches us. I remember him being quite young, maybe in his 20s. He had bowl-cut hair and was kind of dumpy. Not very fat, just a little chubby. I think he chatted with us and played with us a little. My memory is hazy, so I don't remember what happened exactly before he said he had somewhere fun to take us. He scooped my 6 year old cousin up and started walking away. Fast. My 7 year old cousin and I didn't get suspicious. Instead, we followed him, thinking he was really going somewhere fun. In hindsight, what we didn't realise was that he was only interested in my male cousin when we were talking and his speed - he was trying to shake us girls off. 

This weirdo stopped a distance away, at another nearby playground and started 'playing' with my male cousin. Alarm bells started ringing in our heads, so the both of us bolted back to the funeral and alerted our parents. Mayhem ensued: the adults pretty much mobbed to the playground and thank God the guy was still there. I remember this next scene very clearly, because I was pretty shocked by one of my older cousins' reaction. 

Someone snatched my cousin from the guy's hands. Somehow they dragged this guy from the playground to the nearest void deck. One of the older cousins, I'm thinking about 20 back then, whose dad was the one whose funeral we were attending, went berserk. Overcome by the loss of his dad and the fact that someone just tried to snatch another family member, he grabbed the guy and pummelled all his rage and anguish into that guy. My dad and some uncles pulled my cousin back, but not before he got some punches in. 

I don't know if my cousin is traumatized by it. He's pretty sullen and quiet during gatherings, but he's 17 now and he was still pretty chirpy until he reached teenagehood, so I'm assuming it's just a teenage thing. I don't know what happened to that guy, I think they just let him go so that there would be no drama caused. Back then, I had no idea what it all meant exactly. I knew about kidnap, but now, I realise how close my cousin was to being kidnapped by a homosexual pedo. None of us ever spoke about that ever. Honestly though, I doubt any of them even remember. 

TL;DR: Guy tried to snatch my 6 y/o cousin at a funeral, got beaten up by dead uncle's grieving son.

Edit: I asked my dad about it earlier and apparently he remembers. He said he thought the guy was kind of touched in the head. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1375782251.0	1jswbr	"A good ""friend"""	Kinginuit	240	49	30	"Backstory first: im a male and this was back in my late teen years,17-18. Now,we were all a tight knit group of friends,6 of us that were really close in particular,with the same views and tastes for the most part.


This was also a time of heavy drug abuse,weed(in absurd quantities..we rolled joints with brooms)/hash/speed and extasy,lots of it. 


Through mutual friends we meet Fred.5'7,shaved head,glasses and a very chubby/baby-looking face,not really a hit with the ladies. His friend tells us he's been a loner pretty much throughout high school and has a bit of trouble making friends,so we take him under our wing and start hanging out on a daily basis with him,all while getting to know of his..quirky personality. Nothing really strange,just some awkward stuff he does/says,but we brush it off as being a result of his loneliness through school. 


Not long after we learn that he basically hates his father and lives with his mother,who has terminal phase cancer,and has about 4-6 months to live. We dont talk much about it,because it really makes him uneasy when we do,and again its totally understandable. So instead,we did what we did best at that time,and that was to smoke weed.he already smoked prior to meeting us,mind you.


As time goes on he starts smoking more and more and begin acting much weirder,always trying to find the best buzz possible,combining drugs/alcohol,fasting,hyperventilating,etc. He once spiced a blunt with morphine(he stole from his mom's cabinet) and had us smoke it without telling us. His mother passed away shortly after,and we were asked by him to go with him to his mom's funerals. He kept giggling and making jokes during service,which we found a bit weird..but to each his way to cope,right ?After his mother passed he fell down even harder in drugs,too much even for us. we wanted to see him less and less because he would weird us out and even more our outer circle friends,wanted to be ad high as possible all the time,always being the last guy to leave the party,often asking to sleepover. Looking back,i realize he simply didn't want to go home to his father whom he hated..for reasons unknown to us,his dad was a laid back hippy looking guy.


We begin hanging out less often with him and i kinda take pity on him. I hang out with him one on one,playing xbox and talking about the most random shit, and realize he's much more enjoyable one on one then in a group setting. One day,out of the blue,he tells me he found one his mother was a closet lesbian when he went through her stuff after she passed,shows me a ring she left him and tells me to try it. As im putting the ring on i take notice of this huge knife on the counter.knowing his background,i ask him why's the knife out and he makes his way down the hall,to the living room and moves a sofa - He wanted to get smokes but his father had locked his room because he was tired of having his smokes stolen from his son.next logical step?well *cut a fucking 3x3 hole in the wall,of course!* i told him it was the most dumb thing he could have done,how would his father not notice? He got the most serious face and just told me he would put a painting over it. This unnerved me a bit and i left soon after.


A couple of weeks pass and we simply stop answering his phone calls altogether,he's full on creeping us out now.We didn't hear of him for 2 days until we see him pass by the window(at 2 am),grab something on the porch and walk away. We go outside and the only thing missing is an empty Monster can we were using as an ashtray.. Seconds later my bud receives a text from him that said : that can's mine. I bought it. We all look at each other a bit scared.. He lives 15ish miles away and doesn't have a car,only rollerblades. From there,we saw him pop his head in windows a couple of times. Became a running gag amongst us,dont say his name three times or he'll appear! And that kind of shit. 


Until i get a voicemail from him. Where he's crying,saying how much he needs me and loves me,while he's clearly masturbating at the same time he's telling me all of this.*holy fuck.* I was pretty scared by that point. 


He then started sending me emails..really,really long emails that would make no sense at all,how cells didnt mate from a sexual point of view,that he was gay because the ghost of her mother told her to be one just like her,that the ring had to be on seven fingers and that he was totally ok with the fact that i didnt came out of the closet yet,he knew deep down i loved him back.(im straight as can be,also had a girlfriend throughout all of this) The next set of emails would be sent to my friends also,saying how much girls were after him and that he was the total playboy and that we were total faggot assholes for installing cameras in his shower. He also wanted 5 of my friends to try on the ring so it'd make seven,his mother would be so proud! 


After a couple of those nonsense emails me and my friends met up and did the smartest thing we should of done much earlier: get him help. So we printed out an email and went to see his father,who had no idea of the whole thing(except for the hole in the wall). Apparently he acted pretty normal when he was at home.


So he gets sent to a psychiatric ward and two months later he gets out,lithium pills in hand,schizophrenia diagnosed. Happy for him,we meet with him and catch up. He tells us the pills make him ""neutral"": never really sad,but never really happy either. He also tells us he tried smoking weed with the pills,but it makes him freak out way too much,so he decides to lay off the drugs for good. We congratulate him and let him know we're very proud of him for his recovery and that if he needs anything to give us a call. we dont hear from him for a couple of days,until we learn that he stopped taking his meds altogether so he could continue his drug use.. We said fuck it,if you dont want to help yourself in the first place we wont lose our time trying to help you..


All 6 of us stopped taking drugs after that ordeal,except for the occasional blunt around a campfire.

1358212245.0	16l601	"""Seriously Artie, Stop"""	Booty-B	233	41	21	"Okay, so for those of you who have just stumbled upon my story, [here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/16jgge/artie/)
the first part of my story. (Oh lord I hope the link shows up, I'm new to this!)

So in my previous post, I told everyone about the terrible first date I had with Artie. Even though I did end up getting a restraining order on the guy, it wasn't the first action I took against him...because I'm stupid, and for some reason my mom let me talk her out of getting a restraining order against him first thing. As stupid as it sounds, I really didn't want to lose the friendship I had built up with his sister. So all I wanted to do was forget about my bad experience. 

Everything was normal for the next couple months. I never saw Artie around town and he never texted me or tried to contact me. I was starting to feel safe again. Ivonne (his sister) and I were still really close, but I never went to her house anymore. I was scared of seeing Artie. As summer drew closer I decided to move to my grandmother's house, because she lives right in the middle of town, so I wouldn't have to do a lot of driving whenever I wanted to go somewhere.

I was busy making summer plans and doing other teenage girl stuff, when one day I got a text. It was from Artie. I had made sure to keep his number so I wouldn't accidently answer his calls or text him back if he ever tried to contact me. He wanted to come over. My heart was racing. Hell no, dude. There was no way I was even going to text him back. I deleted his text and promptly went back to enjoying my summer.

Weeks later, my mom calls me up. She's pissed. She yells at me for talking to Artie, for having any kind of contact with him. I was so confused, I hadn't even talked to Artie since our date. Not one phone call. Not one text. Nothing. A calmly asked my mom to explain why she thought I was talking to Artie. What she told me still sends shivers down my spine just thinking about it.

Apparently, Artie decided to drive over to my parent's house earlier that day. Now, my mom and stepdad are very welcoming people, they hardly ever turn guest away, and when they do, it always for a good reason. Artie didn't even give them a chance to send him away though. He just walked into their house and sat himself down on their couch. Weird, right? My mom tried to tell him that I wasn't home. He told her he knew, that he had called me earlier that morning, and I said that I was coming over in a little bit. He told them that we wanted to have a ""family dinner"" with them, but he wanted to talk to my stepdad first. 

He asks my stepdad for his permission to date me, that we had been waiting to ask for a long time, but hadn't worked up the courage. My stepdad just glared at Artie and told him hell no, he didn't approve at all. Artie choked at first (lol thanks, Kramanos!) but then he laughed and told Dave that he was hilarious, like what my stepdad said was a joke. My parents couldn't get Artie to leave, so they all just sat around for about two hours, waiting for me to show up. When it became apparent that I wasn't showing up, my parents finally threatened to call the cops. Artie got the message and left. Later my mom called me to ask me what was going on. When I explained to her that I hadn't talked to him in months, and the last text he sent me was weeks ago, she was just as freaked out as I was.

As I said earlier, I got a restraining order, but not soon enough. I have more stories. Will post more later!

1353472882.0	13jttk	My boyfriend tried to kill me under the influence of drugs when I was 16. 	houseofLEAVEPLEASE	255	63	57	"I'm not sure how relevant this story is to the thread, but I've been drinking and it feels relevant, so, here goes:

When I was 16 I made the monumentally bad decision to run away from home and live with my boyfriend at the time (""Brad,"" 19), one of my best friends who was my age (we'll call her Bethany) , and her boyfriend (Ivan, 23). I can't even being to enumerate all of the ways in which this was a horrible idea and a bad situation, but I was a very stupid teenager and it seemed adventurous and fun and I was exhilarated by the lifestyle these men were living. 

My absolute best friend at the time (also my age, we'll call her Christy) was dating a 20 year old (Alex) that was selling psychedelic mushrooms. He always let all of us have first taste so that he could get a general idea of how strong they were and how to charge for them. For some reason that I can't even begin to recall right now, Ivan and Bethany were out of town, and Christy and Alex were staying in the master bedroom for the weekend. There were several ""white caps"" in Alex's most recent batch and those were the ones that we were eating. 

Over the course of a couple of hours my boyfriend and I were growing restless with how long it was taking for the drugs to kick in and, stupidly, ended up eating 7 grams between us. It didn't take long after the last dose for me to start tripping... and it was a very hard, very uncomfortable, very intense trip. I remember that it took the drugs longer to hit my boyfriend, so he had to watch over me for about an hour while I had a temporary psychological breakdown. I won't go into what I experienced during the trip because that really isn't the point of the post but, against advice, I ended up forcing myself to throw up everything that I could to end the trip as quickly as possible. Alex and Christy were already in bed. 

After I'd thrown up and was, for the most part, coming down,  I went to lie down with my boyfriend in the dark, and that was when he started tripping. He was thinking very cyclically and repeating the words to Tool songs as if they were Bible passages. None of this struck me as particularly odd, for some reason, even though I'd never seen cyclical thinking to this degree during a trip and the unfamiliarity should've set off alarm bells in my head. Then the scary part started.

One minute I was doing my level best to calm him down and reassure him, and the next minute he was on top of me with my head between his hands, trying to break my neck. He didn't try for very long, but I didn't try to run immediately after he'd stopped because I was between him and a wall, and he was much, much larger than me and I was sure I wouldn't make it. Seeing no other option, I soothed him while I tried to construct an escape. 

He tried to break my neck twice more before an out presented itself. I have no idea how I survived this because he was absolutely physically capable of doing it. 

A short time after his third attempt to kill me, he somehow decided that we needed to get married. He picked me up and started to carry me (completely naked) into the bedroom that Alex and Christy were sharing, somehow convinced that one of them could perform legal marriage rites. 

This was the best opportunity I'd seen to escape, so I did. Before we could get to the bedroom, I fought him like a wild animal, clawing and writhing and screaming like a banshee. Finally, he lost his grip on me and I fell, then scrambled into the bathroom and locked the door. I vaguely remember knocking over a chair as I ran to slow him down. As soon as I'd locked the door I started to hear commotion on the other side. There was yelling and scuffling and unintelligible babbling, and then someone knocked on the door. 

I was absolutely terrified of losing my life so I ignored the knocking and started trying to figure out how to open the sealed bathroom window. After about a minute of this desperate knocking, I realized that the knocking was coming from Christy. She'd been yelling the whole time to open the door and let her in. 

The moment I realized that it was her, I unlocked the door without thinking. As soon as I swung the door open, I saw my boyfriend break out of Alex's arms about five feet away from the bathroom door. He knocked my friend out of the way as he ran to get to me. Alex had thought that he'd completely immobilized him, but he was wrong. My boyfriend  tackled me to the bathroom floor and redoubled his efforts to break my neck. I remember my head being twisted so far around that I could clearly see the tiny pits in the bathroom tile behind me. 

I'm incredibly lucky that Alex was there because I probably would've died if he hadn't been. He yanked my boyfriend off of me long enough for Christy to crash into the bathroom with me and lock the door behind her. I was sobbing uncontrollably, naked and bruised and more terrified than I'd ever been in my life, but she was clear-headed enough to impress upon me the importance of getting the fuck out of the house. The only clothes that I could find were a wadded up black sweater with a cat decal on the front, and a pair of men's boxers. Both were crusted with dried vomit.

My friend finally managed to pry the window open and we crawled outside. Covered in vomit, tear-streaked and bruised, I followed her to a nearby friends' (Melissa and Walter)  house for asylum. I was utterly hysterical by the time we got there, but I managed to give my friends a basic outline of what happened. Walter left the apartment, exclaiming that he had to find my boyfriend, and I absolutely understand that. I even somehow managed to understand it at the time. I knew that this behavior was the drugs talking, not my boyfriend, and that his safety was important. I won't say that I thought that he had as much of a claim to safety at that moment as I did because I was running on adrenaline and determined to survive and not at all concerned with justice or rational fairness, but he definitely didn't deserve to be forgotten just because some drugs had affected him adversely. 

Finally, I managed to calm down on my friend's couch and stop hyperventilating. It was at this point that Walter arrived back home, and who does he have in tow? My psychotic boyfriend, wrapped in a black curtain with pupils the size of saucers. My friends sat back as he settled onto the couch next to me and started apologizing profusely for what he'd done. I listened for a couple of minutes, my body as tense and rigid as it had ever been, when he started to slip back into cyclical thinking. I learned then, through his rambling, that he'd tried to kill me because he thought that God had told him that he had to kill me so that we could be together in heaven. 

After I lost the ability to deal with the trauma and the stress, disheartened by my friends' inability to see that his proximity was putting me in danger, I jumped up from the couch and ran out of the apartment complex. I couldn't face another murder attempt, with or without my friends present. 

I ran all the way to another nearby friend's apartment and ended up staying there for the night, still covered in vomit and tears. I try not to think about how it's affected my life, but I'm sure it's had a very negative impact and I'll never, ever forget it.

1333091837.0	rkmgh	[My] Room Service	Rec7ify	229	38	23	"The following story took place in 2004. The dialogue is paraphrased but accurately conveys what happened.


Every year during March Break my family would drive roughly 2 hours into the city from our rural town to enjoy a college basketball tournament. We routinely stayed at a large, reputable hotel minutes from the downtown core, and were no strangers to the city. However, this year was different; there had been a rash of violent muggings and swarmings in the downtown core of the city, which had left many severely injured. I remember reading about these attacks in the newspaper (I've always enjoyed reading the news, even as a young child) and feeling scared. Those reports rattled me in a way typical news stories didn't, possibly because I wasn't used to the threat of violence so close to home.


It was Saturday night around 11 PM and my family (mom, dad, and my little sister) were winding down and preparing for bed. It's worth mentioning at this point that my mother is naturally paranoid, much more so than other moms. While it can be annoying by times, it often leaves us prepared for bad situations. Tonight would be one of those times.


I was sitting on the second of two beds, furthest from the entrance to the room, when there was a knock at the door.


""Room service,"" a voice called out. My parents glanced at each other and my mom motioned for my dad to look through the peephole in the door. 


""We didn't order anything"" said my dad as he sized up the short, stocky, white male standing outside our door. He had with him a trolley with what appeared to be a meal on it and was wearing a green hotel uniform.


""Are you sure?"" he responded. ""I've got an order here for room 4109.""


The guy at the door didn't sound pushy or out of place at all; in fact, if it wasn't for the recent violence in the city, we probably wouldn't have had our guard up in the first place. However, that night my parents were certainly cautious, and my father firmly told the man at the door that we didn't order any food. He left politely, without incident.


We had little reason to be suspicious and my dad wanted to chalk it up to a mistake on the hotel's behalf and get to bed. However, my mother eventually persuaded him to call the front desk to check if everything was on the up and up. 15 minutes or so after the man had left our door, my dad got off the phone with the front desk.


""They have no record of us ordering food and their room service staff wear white, not green"" he said grimly. I noticed my mother's face whiten and my sister looked scared. The hotel immediately sent security up to our floor to see if the intruder was still around. They checked on us then went about searching the floor. Security came back to our room a few minutes later, telling us they had found an empty trolley in the stairwell, but that there was no one to be found. With that they departed and we triple checked the locks on the door before hitting the hay.


The next morning I was the first one awake. I didn't want to turn on the TV and wake my family and there was no newspaper in the room, so I booted up my dad's laptop and checked the local newspaper's website. The first headline read ""Man stabbed outside city hotel.""


Apparently, at roughly 11:30 the previous night, right after we had turned away the fake hotel employee at our door, a pedestrian had been attacked outside our hotel in the middle of the sidewalk. He had been stabbed twice and then badly beaten in plain sight, yet his wallet wasn't stolen. The article went on to say that there was no apparent motive for the mugging; it was pure violence for violence's sake. It also mused as to why the pedestrian had been stabbed to the point where he couldn't fight back, but then beaten by hand. I woke my parents up right away and showed them the article. My mother became very nervous and checked about the room (even though it was now morning) while my dad looked very angry and reached for the phone. Naturally we contacted the police and told them our story about the previous night. We provided as much information about the man at our door as possible, thinking he may have been responsible for the assault, but no one was ever caught.


Thankfully we had several inches of locked door between us and the fake employee; it may have just saved our lives."	t5_2t3t8	True
1332903441.0	rgxzb	How [My] Elementary school friend saved my life.	hydjw	222	28	28	"Back in elementary school I always walked home from school. It was a ten minute walk to my house and I didn't have to spend thirty minutes on a bus. I was a shy kid and had some friends I always played with. We played with pogs and fought over who was the green ranger. 

Well there was this one kid in third grade, I can't remember but I think he was new just transferred. He didn't talk or have any friends.. Dressed in a jean jacket everyday and was tough looking for a third grader. I had never talked to this kid ever and one day he walks up to me on the playground alone and says ""I'm going to kill you today."" I laughed and was like ok. 


Well my friend had heard it and she said ""Aren't you going to tell the teacher? "" I said ""No he's not going to do anything he's just being mean."" 
Well I left from school that day went home and went to bed. Next day I'm called into the principle's office and my mom and dad are there. The principle explained to my parents what the kid had said and said they where expelling him and thanks to my friend they stopped a bully. 

Well I went on with life and never ever saw him again and went into high school.I went through some depression and my mother told me to value my life because I'm lucky to be alive.. I asked why? 

She then explained how my friend had told the teacher right before school let out. They caught the kid as soon as he was about to leave. They searched his backpack and found a combat knife, And they called my parents and told them everything. While agreeing to not fill me in on everything so they wouldn't scare me.
So back in third grade I almost died from a crazy kid... I was shocked and ever since then I still don't know what happened to that kid.

1373538733.0	1i2mbp	Good blinds are important.	woeepu	224	32	20	"Note: Posted on /r/nosleep, was told to come here.

I'm female, and was about 20 at the time. I lived in a basement apartment with a room-mate. One night I couldn't sleep. It was about 4 in the morning, I usually got up at 5am to get ready for work, so I called in sick (I worked for my dad and could get away with that), and just sat in my room on the internet in the dark. I then got a big whiff of cigarette smoke. My room-mate at the time and I did not smoke, but every once in a while in the mornings while getting ready I would smell cigarette smoke faintly. I was often in a hurry and shrugged it off to just being lingering smells on my clothes from visiting smoking friends. At this time it was very strong smelling, I decided to investigate. The smell clearly was coming from my room. I decided to get a second opinion from my room-mate who stays up until morning gaming. He smelled it too and thought it originated from my slightly ajar window. He pulled back the blinds to go in for a better sniff. A silhouette outside, lit from behind by a street light, shifted away quickly. My room-mate grabbed a bat and headed outside. He found nothing. I had crappy plastic broken blinds with horizontal slits, so we placed a towel over them and covered every other window in the apartment.


This same event played out a couple more mornings at about weekly intervals while getting ready for work at about 5am. After returning from my shower to my room, I would smell smoke, lose my cool, look out the window, and get my room-mate who would go outside too late to see anyone. We devised a plan to next time not check the window. I was to go to my room-mate calmly and he would sneak out with his bat to catch the silhouette.


Another morning arrived carrying the scent of smoke. The plan worked. He caught a man with a big hood that shielded his face from view. The man made a feeble excuse about a cat, and ran off. When It got lighter out I went outside to look at my window. The grass was all worn like someone had been sitting there quite often for quite some time, there were also cigarette butts everywhere. The cops were notified and kept an eye on the area, but the silhouette never returned.. that I knew of at least.


The moral is always bring your clothes to the bathroom with you when you shower. It pains me to think of all the times he must have seen me drop my towel."	t5_2t3t8	True

Okay, here it is. The final part of the story. I’ve already pointed out how weird it is that all of a sudden the entire universe seemingly wanted to shit on me so I won’t elaborate on that any further.

 

Just to put one thing in perspective though, because after reading comments I think the story might be a bit misleading…I’m not a particularly bad ass person. Stubborn is probably the right word, but I didn’t handle any of this shit with that sort of suave James Bond-esque demeanor that some of you might be expecting, it was more sloppily pasted together with duct tape, and me crossing my fingers hoping it’d stay put. That said, I have been told I am debonair in the way I dress and speak, so if you want to picture me as James Bond, go for it I guess. I guess this paragraph wasn’t all that necessary.  

 

I’m at Gordon’s house now, drinking a beer, and I tell him about my night, albeit forgetting several details. We laugh it off and he tells me that he has an old school friend staying over, Jason. I know Jason pretty well. We used to play computer games together, and he was always an odd guy, and that only got worse as he got older. He just gave off really weird vibes when he spoke and he was socially awkward as hell. I’m socially awkward but he made me look pretty normal.

 

I ask about him and Gordon tells me he’s been really strange. He’s sleeping upstairs now though so I don’t have to worry. We keep shooting the shit and I’m a few beers down when Jason comes downstairs, looking all tired/dazed. I say hi, we speak a little bit, nothing unusual.

 

It’s about 5:30AM when I decide I should get some sleep. Also beer makes me tired as fuck, so I tell Gordon and he takes me up to the spare bedroom. Jason has a room right next to mine and he goes into it. I say goodnight and lie down in the bed, but before even a few seconds have passed Jason comes in. I realize that he’s drunk as fuck, and even though he’d slept a bit, he still smelt like alcohol and was all woozy, so I wasn’t taking him too seriously. He sits on the side of the bed and starts telling me about how shitty his life has been and I’m just kind of like “Yeah, that’s cool…”

 

He’d recently been through a break up and he tells me that when he was having sex with his girlfriend she would just sort of lie there, limp fish, and when he was done, she’d never want to cuddle. I find this fucking hilarious. He said it with so much…passion. Like he really, really wanted his ex-girlfriend to cuddle with him post-coitus. Not that there’s anything wrong with that, it’s just not something guys blurt out on a usual basis. So I burst out laughing and he says “Don’t you fucking laugh.”

 

I keep laughing because I genuinely think he’s still rolling with the joke. And he turns to me and says “Stop fucking laughing, it isn’t fucking funny.” I take the hint and stop laughing. Then I say “Sorry dude but I’ve had a bit of a fucked up night, I really just wanna sleep.” Aaaaand he says, “So sleep then.” Still just chilling on the side of the bed.

 

“I’m not gonna sleep with you here; get out,” I say, in a pretty friendly way.

 

I don’t know what happened next – I don’t know if it was just him being drunk and passing out or him doing it intentionally, but he collapses on top of me. I throw him off and he lands off the side of the bed and just straight up jumps on top of me. Me and Gordon went to school with this guy and we used to do a lot of playfighting or whatever. You know, wrestling type shit, and I assume he’s doing that. Despite me telling him that all I wanna do is fucking sleep he keeps jumping on me or trying to wrestle my head or some shit. So eventually, I (gasp) get really pissed off and decide to really hurt him.

 

He’s basically lying right on top of me, not doing much of anything. So I grab him by the shirt and lift him just push him into the wall. His head hits pretty hard and he yells “Ow fuck!”

 

I’m not that angry but I just say “Dude get the fuck out, I really wanna sleep.”

 

He walks towards the door, opens it, and then says, I shit you not, “I’m gonna slit your throat in your sleep.”

 

FUCK. THIS. SHIT. I facepalm and he walks out. I get up and figure there’s no fucking way I’m sleeping here. Not on a night like this. I’m gonna go home, something I should’ve done hours ago.

 

I go to Gordon’s room and wake him up. I tell him what happened and say I’m just over the entire night and wanna go home. He tells me it’ll be better if I just stick it out, it’s still dark, and some sleep will do me good. He has another bed in his room and he can just lock the door, so I agree, he locks up, and we go to sleep.

 

Cue 7AM, someone’s knocking on the door. Gordon doesn’t wake up but I do and I just kind of waltz over in my zombie-like-still-sleeping daze and open up. There’s Jason. Standing. Just standing there, head down. I have a few questions about this.

 

·         Why is he standing there?

·         Did he sleep at all?

·         He probably tried to check my room to see if he could kill me

 

He doesn’t say or do anything. And I’m still stuck in that overwhelm – like I’ve spent too much time being scared to feel scared so much as just wanting to puke and then sleep because I really think that’s what I need more than anything right now. So I give it a few seconds. And I shut the door and lock it. He does the worst thing he could possibly do: nothing. If he knocked again I’d get it, but this seemed like some Paranormal Activity type shit. I’m lying in bed and I realize sleep isn’t gonna happen, so I’m basically staring at the ceiling. It’s also starting to get fucking cold and it’s really foggy outside.

 

Gordon’s room has a balcony with a glass window that looks out onto their garden which is massive, so I’m kind of checking it out, ‘cause looking out and breathing was the only thing that made me feel normal for a few moments. I slip my shoes on and grab a jacket out of Gordon’s cupboard and step outside. It had that crisp, cold morning air to it, and to be honest, for those few moments I really felt okay. Even a little bit peaceful. I have a cigarette and watch the fog drifting around.

 

I head back inside after a few minutes and lie down under the blanket, cold as fuck, waiting for it to warm up, when I look over to the window and god-damn-fucking-Jason is just standing there. Just creepin’. I ask what the fuck he’s doing and he says “Let me in,” so I do. He steps in and sits down and I just can’t resist asking what is wrong with him. He tells me about how upset he is about his girlfriend and I listen and tell him I totally get what he’s going through but he’s turning into a creep. He agreed and we actually had a nice talk. I ended up taking him out a few weeks later to talk to random people and get out of his shell a little bit. It didn’t work but it was funny as hell to watch, and it makes me feel really bad to say this but it was just really, really good cringe humor.

 

ANYWAYS. Jason isn’t really a concern anymore. It’s also early in the morning, sun is up and I’m clearly not allowed to sleep, so I head downstairs and raid Gordon’s fridge for more beer. Whenever we visit each other the fridge and pantry are free game so I’m making myself some breakfast and talking to Jason trying to cheer him up and Gordon’s parents wake up and come downstairs. I say hi, they leave pretty soon after and I ask Jason to grab the remote and let me out.

 

Things finally seem pretty calm, and it’s about 8:30AM now. I drive out and head home, skipping Alexandria by taking the highway and my house is only 10 minutes away or so. There are two routes I can take home and I usually switch it up based on whichever one ends up happening randomly, and on this particular day, I drive down this long road that winds down a mountain pass, so a long, windy, narrow road that goes steeply downhill. Right before that though I drive past a small sky blue Diahatsu stopped, not exactly in the middle of the road, but enough to block the one lane so people driving past are slowing down and hooting because it’s just annoying. I join the angry mob and give the guy a little bit of horn action as I drive past, but I notice he’s sleeping – looks full on passed out, and this is a pretty busy street.

 

I’m worried he’s diabetic and randomly fainted or something, so I pull over in a little parking spot and walk over to him. I also notice that there was another Red Bull lying in my car, so score. I walk up to him and he’s got his window open, chair all the way back, just sleeping.

 

I get closer. The car smells like shit. This smell hits my face and I genuinely think this fucker shat himself and was sitting in it. There are crumbs all over his jacket and empty plastic bags scattered across the car. I snoop for at least a minute before noticing that he’s been staring at me the whole fucking time. Pretty average looking dude, late 20s, early 30s. I thought he was sleeping. So after silently screaming like a little girl I say, “Oh shit, I thought you were asleep, sorry.”

 

He smiles. And I will never forget how creepy his smile was. Imagine a dude who smelt like shit in a tiny little blue DIahatsu smiling at you like he was The Mona Lisa. I can’t describe it. And he says “No, I’m not sleeping.”

 

A little lost for words I point out that he’s kind of in the middle of the road and ask if he’s feeling alright. He keeps that smile up and says “Don’t worry about it. You have a good day now.” His voice was soft and empathetic. Pedo fashion. It was just really creepy. I decide to let it go and walk away, but I just get this feeling he’s going to follow me.

 

I remember that I’m in South Africa, and in South Africa it’s kind of a hijacking routine for someone to lie out on the middle of the street playing dead so that when you go and help them someone just jumps in your car and buzzes out, and there are some pretty elaborate schemes to steal your shit, so I think maybe I’ve just fallen for one. I’m walking to my car and when I look back he’s walking behind me. I get to my car and turn around to watch him. He stops right in front of me, not saying a word. That smell follows him. I’m pretty sure he was on drugs, but seriously, what drug does that? He wasn’t cocaine-active, he seemed maybe a little doped out, but there had to be something more. Maybe opiates and alcohol, I don’t fucking know, and I’m still sticking to my story when I say he’d shat himself ‘cause that smell followed him.

 

He doesn’t say anything. So I do. “What?”

 

The smile came back. “Nothing.”

 

I heave a sigh and get in my car. As I drive off he puts a hand through my open window and tries to hold on but it’s so half assed that he doesn’t even step to keep up with me, and I just drive on. I don’t know what he was doing. I don’t know what he wanted. And honestly, I don’t care. For all I know the armed guard could’ve been behind me at that point and I wouldn’t have cared.

 

Home was just a few blocks away. I made it. I finally had fucking made it. I opened my garage and parked my car. I closed the garage and no one had crept in. I took a deep breath and I had trouble believing I was actually home. It was fucking beautiful. I’ve never appreciated having a home before. A place that’s just safe. So I did the only logical thing I could do: I went to the kitchen, and I had a double whisky, I had a beer, and I had a glass of red wine. Then I passed the fuck out.

 

I slept until about 10PM, and then I lazily drifted in bed and watched movies and shit. It was beautiful, and there were no creeps. I charged my phone. I told my mom I loved her. And I never, ever told anyone what happened. I told them a few parts. But seriously, who the fuck would believe that all this happened in the space of less than 12 hours? I didn’t go out for a long time after that. It seemed like everything would just go wrong. I was terrified, and I still think I was justified in not really trusting the world for a while after.

 

However, I did notice one thing: I prompted a lot of what happened. The way I was raised, my brother and I were expected to be staunch and masculine. “Never back down” type of thing. We went to boarding schools – along with Gordon, which explains why he was so happy to just fight the 4 guys -- that made for some amazing stories on their own, but the whole mentality we were groomed into was that if you ever got angry with someone and didn’t do anything about it, you’re a pussy. That attitude has its place, but if I hadn’t been so damned stubborn about giving Jason shit, giving Group 2 shit, giving the Afrikaaners at the gas station shit, and finding out why Diahatsu man was sleeping, the night wouldn’t have been so fucking eerie. That attitude has its place, but I had to tone it down a lot.

 

In a way it’s a little sad, because honestly if I see someone in trouble I’d love to go up and help them; but most the time I can’t find it in me anymore, because they could just be full of shit.

 

All in all, and even though it’s weird to say, that night really changed my life. I just chilled out after that. Not out of fear. Well, at first out of fear, but later it was because it felt easier and more natural. So I’ve made a full recovery (I think) and the story is pretty damn cool. Also I think I got all my creep experiences over and done with that night because it hasn't happened since. Let me know if you guys have any questions, and once again, thank you all for taking so much interest in it!

1374787992.0	1j2000	White Hair	Alan-Rickman	230	43	29	"I am a college student, and I ride the city bus every day to get to campus. The people who ride the city bus are a mixture of university students and employees (we get to ride the bus for free with our university IDs), as well as locals who usually can't afford cars. I don't mind the riff-raff from the locals; I just put in my headphones and zone out.
On this particular day, about a year ago, I was running late and forgot my head phones. ""Fuck it"", I thought. The bus ride was only about 15 minutes.
I wait for the bus with about 5 other people. One of whom was an elderly man. We file on, I find a seat, and the elderly man sits across the aisle from me. He begins to quietly mutter something unintelligible. I think nothing of it, and begin flipping through my phone to pass the time.
We get to the next stop, more people file on. I can hear what the man is saying now; he is weirdly describing all the women who are getting onto the bus. An Asian woman gets on: ""Yellow nigger. Black hair. White shirt. Blue pants."" An African American woman: ""Black nigger. Black hair. Pink shirt. Yellow skirt.""
I wasn't sure what he was doing at first, but I kept checking every description he muttered and was able to match it with a woman entering the bus or sitting near me.
He does this for all the women who get on for the next few stops. His voice is barely above a whisper, and everyone else around me is wearing headphones, so only I can hear him.
He keeps repeating a description of someone I can't figure out on the bus. ""White nigger. White hair. White shirt. Black skirt...White nigger. White hair. White shirt. Black shirt."" No one on the bus has white hair, except for him. Now I'm not so sure if he is actually talking about people on the bus, or just mumbling nonsense. ""Poor guy"" I thought, ""He needs some help.""
Then, it dawns on me. The description of the person he keeps repeating is of me. I have extremely blonde hair, which could be considered white almost, and I was wearing a black skirt and a white shirt. My blood runs cold. I frantically look around at the other people on the bus. No one is paying any attention to him.
""White nigger. White hair. White shirt. Black skirt..""
The other chilling thing is that he wasn't looking at me at all. He was staring straight ahead the entire time. Then he starts saying something else...Something that sounds like ""wuzza shifuck..."" I strain me ears.
My stomach flips painfully in my gut. He is now saying ""Wonder if she'll fuck me...I wonder if she'll FUCK me."" He looks like he is enjoying saying the word ""fuck"". He lets it sit in his mouth for an uncomfortably long time. ""I wanna FUCK her...Fuck her.."", he mutters.
He continues to describe me to himself, as I sit on the bus, terrified, until it lurches to a halt at my stop. I jolt up. I want to leave. Right as I get up, the man turns his head to look at me with crazy, piercing blue eyes. His unruly eyebrows quiver, as his face transforms into a half grimace, half smile.
I run off the bus. To my horror, he is right behind me. His walk is something I will never forget: he walked as though one side of his body was out of sync with the other. As if, half of him was stepping into a deep hole while the other was on even ground. The result was a horrifying lurch as he quickly wobbled towards me.
I couldn't take it. I ran as fast I could. Every time I looked back, he was there. ""How is he keeping up with me?"" I thought. I was truly horrified about what he might want to do to me once he got close enough. I made a sharp turn and peeled into a University building with tinted windows. I was drenched in sweat and hyperventilating. I saw him as he jerked by the building, looking confused and crazy as ever, still muttering to himself.
I tried to remember what I had come to campus for... Lunch with my sister. I frantically called her and told her to meet me where I was. I was shaking dialing her number. She asked what was wrong, I just told her to come get me. When she finally arrived, I had never been more happy to see her."	t5_2t3t8	True
1373595874.0	1i4kox	Get her in the car.	itstoofuckingcold	216	27	15	"One late night, my boyfriend and I were at the park hanging out, talking and just goofing around. Around 12am, we decide that we should both head home so we say our goodbyes and start walking in opposite directions. I put my headphones in and start to listen to music. About a minute later, I felt something was a bit off so I turned around to see a white SUV pull up beside me. I took off my headphones and the car came to a complete stop. Two of the windows roll down and I'm confused at this point.

Four guys in hoodies sat in the car smoking blunts and they turned down the music. I'm standing there frozen and the closest one next to me smiles. 

""Hey honey, would you like to come to a party with us?""

I say no and state that my boyfriend is right around the corner getting something from his house. They ignore me and continue,  ""Nah, c'mon. It'll be so much fun. You can trust us. Come party with us."" I say no again and try to walk away. Yet *again* they persist, and said,  ""Come party with us cutie. What's your name anyway?? You'll have a lot of fun, just trust us. You'll like it.""

At that moment, one of the guys speaks up. I can't see his face but all I hear from his direction is, ""Hey... I know her. Get her in the car man. Now."" I'm frozen and one of the guys starts to unlock his door. I'm beginning to panic but at that moment a **ray of light shone down on me** as my boyfriend is just in view down the street. I manage to say to the guys, ""Oh there's my boyfriend.."" they look back, see him and roll up the windows and drive off. Turns out my boyfriend had accidentally taken my pipe and turned around to give it to me. He saw the car and asked what had happened and after I told him, he walked me home every night since."	t5_2t3t8	True
1371151854.0	1gadj5	"""John"""	seannachai	222	31	34	"This is quite long, but worth the read imo.
I've followed this subreddit for a while now, but this is my first time posting. I've had my fair share of weird/creepy encounters in my life, but this story is one of two that have ever truly left me frightened for any extended period of time. This is the story of John, my childhood stalker. (I'm 20/f for context's sake, btw). 

When I was a kid my mom and step-dad owned their own maintenance company. We lived out in the middle of nowhere in the south. All the neighboring towns were very small, and everyone knew everyone. Because of this there has always been a heightened sense of trust amongst the community. Every so often my mom and step-dad would get a job that was just too much for them to accomplish on their own; when that happened they would hire local boys, usually from the high school and community college, to help out. 

Again, we lived in a very small town that still very much believed in southern hospitality, so it wasn't all that unusual for these boys to be invited over for dinner with my family. 

Enter John. John was in his mid-twenties and had only recently moved to our town from NYC. John was a bit awkward, but he was a very hard worker and, at first, came across as very kind hearted. I was eleven when John started working for my family. He would come and join us for meals after working for my family all day. My big sister, who was just a few years younger than John, had recently moved out west and I missed her a lot, so when John began to show interest in me I was very excited. Look at that, now I have a big brother figure who thinks my middle school drama is interesting to listen to over dinner!

My family liked John and hired him on for the next few jobs they got. John continued to be very friendly toward me, but I and my family always interpreted it as someone who wanted to be nice to me. 

September rolls around. John has worked for my family for a couple of months by now. My birthday is coming up and my family promises to take me bowling (an hour's drive away, so it was a big deal for me). They tell me this when John is around, and somehow John ends up inviting himself. I remember thinking it was kind of weird, but John had always been nice and I didn't want to be rude and say that I didn't want him around. 

My family was also heavily involved in the local fire dept. Every year we would volunteer to do this haunted hay ride event, where basically people would dress up like monsters and go out into the woods and scare the guests that came through, with all the money going to the fire department. The event was scheduled to start two weeks after my birthday. My mom mentions it to John and he says that he's really interested in it, and could he help out? My mom, bless her heart, is the sweetest little southern lady and says of course he can, she'll put him in contact with the man who runs it. 

Well, John ends up doing it and, plot twist, ends up being put in the same area as my family and I because he apparently didn't want to work with strangers. Um. Okay. This is when things started getting weird. Mind you, this event required us working long, late nights out in the woods. In the beginning of the season there would sometimes be long gaps between groups. The first weekend we had a gap like that. A boy I was friends with was working the next station over, and I  told my mom I was going to go say hi to him. I took the path through the woods so in case a group came through they wouldn't see a small preteen girl covered in fake blood skipping through the woods, because that's hardly scary. As I'm walking I hear something and turn around. There's John. I ask him what he's doing and he said he saw me leave and didn't want me to get hurt. I tell him I'm fine and that my mom knows where I'm going, and that these woods are very safe (the most dangerous animals around were deer). He says he doesn't feel comfortable with me walking by myself, and grabs my arm. This freaked me out and I pulled it away, and said I was just going to go back to our station. The rest of the run John always managed to show up whenever I was alone to talk to me. I never mentioned this to my mom because I still felt like my dislike for John was rude; my family liked him, so surely I should, too. 

Fast forward to February. John hasn't been around much because most of the work hasn't required him. Then, on Valentines Day, I get home and see a vase of red roses in the kitchen. I ask my mom if my step-dad gave them to her. She says no. She hands me the card. It says something along the lines of: ""[my name here], you're the most beautiful girl I have ever see. I love you."" My mom asks me if there were any boys at school who would send me something like that. I tell her no; we exchanged carnations at school, and I had never had a boy interested in me. 

The next week John swings by (not all that unusual). While he's there he asks me if I liked my flowers. I played dumb and asked him what flowers, which upset him. I told my mom and she was pissed, and asked him what he was playing at. He insisted it was just a friendly gesture and he hadn't meant anything by it; he just thought a ""pretty girl deserved roses on Valentines Day."" My mom told him to never pull shit like that again.

Cue April. Mysterious bouquets of flowers start getting delivered weekly, then almost daily. My mom knows it must be John. She calls him and tells him to cut it out and that he's not welcome anymore. My family had a desktop in a room that had several windows. One evening I was downstairs dinking around on the computer when I hear a tap on the window and look out and there's John standing on our porch, smiling this really creepy smile. I get up and poke my head out the door and tell him that my mom doesn't want him coming around. He says he just wants to talk to me. Being a dumb twelve-year-old I step out on the porch. He then proceeds to tell me that he wants to wait for me, that I'm the most beautiful ""woman"" he knows and that he loves me, but that he knows I'm young so he's willing ""to wait a few years."" I make up some excuse to go back in the house and get my mom. I'm crying at this point. Well my mom and step-dad go downstairs and tell him that they will shoot his ass if they don't get off our property right now. He gets pissed and says they're trying to deny us our love (what. the. fuck.). My step-dad says he's serious about getting the gun so John eventually leaves, but says that ""they can't keep him away from me.""

We go to the cops. We get a restraining order. Remember the whole small town part? Well, turns out small towns don't take well to grown ass men who harass little girls. John essentially gets driven out of the town and goes back to NYC. I think that's the end of it.

Then the phone calls start. He would call from prepaid phones and pay phones so the numbers were never consistent. My mom forbid me from answering the phone unless I knew who it was (before I would always answer unknown numbers if I was home alone, because our home phone was also the work phone so it was usually clients). My mom didn't tell me until much later that the calls were getting continuously more violent and sexual in nature. We would always call the cops but very little was done.

Then things stopped. It seemed like everything was over. I started high school and soon forgot all about creepy John. Boys my own age began to like me and everything seemed to be normal. Until the end of my senior year of high school. A letter came addressed to me, and inside was a horribly graphic letter talking about how I was old enough for him to come back (I was sixteen, by the way), and that I had better dump my loser boyfriend because it was time for him to come back in my life; that he knew I wanted him and he would do whatever it took to make sure we were reunited. 

The cops were called again and my school was informed. I only had a month left of term and spent that last month with my teachers watching me like a hawk. My mom insisted on coming to pick me up every day (I didn't have my own car) and I wasn't allowed to leave with anyone else. We get a call from the cops a few weeks later telling us that John has been arrested for unrelated charges, but that they can't disclose more than that. 

I thought that would be the end of it. Since I graduated so young I didn't leave for university until the next year (17, about to turn 18). I moved a few hours away and landed a pretty sweet acting gig the fall I moved. Then in October, two scary things happened in one week. Another letter arrived at my mom's house, just as scary and threatening as the first. Then at my job, which largely involved a lot of audience interaction, a lady handed me a note at the end of the run. I was confused but kept it, only to open it in the dressing room. It was addressed to me (using my full name) inviting me to ""meet up with her and her friend."" We didn't have programs that listed names and I had never seen her before. I have no clue if that was related at all to John, but given that he had just made contact AGAIN I was incredibly shaken by it.

I haven't heard from him since. I've moved again since that last letter. I don't know if he's still in jail (I certainly hope so). I just hope that, as traumatic as all of that was for me, he never pursued or (heaven forbid) attacked any other young girls.

1365219448.0	1bs1jb	So let me tell you about the time I met a serial killer... (X-Post from TIL)	HaploXar42	252	61	78	"[X-Post from TIL:](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1br6ue/til_there_may_be_as_many_as_3550_active_serial/c999cvb)  
  
My ex girlfriend and I once met a serial killer. We were lucky to escape with our lives. Scary to know they're out there. Even scarier to have a brush with one and know you were almost a victim.

EDIT: Looks like there's some interest in the full story so here goes:  
  
So one night my girlfriend (at the time) and I decided to take some acid and trip for the night. Anyone that's actually done acid know that you don't see things that aren't really there. It's more a shifting of perception. It's important to know that.  
  
Also important to note is that we lived in a very small beach community and there was a hurricane right off the coast. Everyone was supposed to evacuate the next day, so the town is very quiet and mostly empty, at this point.
  
We lived within walking distance of the beach, and the beach is amazing on acid (sober too!), so we went for a walk to the beach.  
  
We played at the beach for a while, then decided to walk home, because I had a bad feeling. The beach just felt wrong. I always trust my instincts (especially on acid) so we start walking home.  
  
On the way, I decided to stop behind a mini-mall because they had a lot of trees, and trees are neat when you're tripping. You become more sensitive to patterns and trees are full of interesting patterns. So the two of us are sitting on a curb, in an almost deserted beach town, looking at the trees across the side street we're on.  
  
I'm not paying much attention but noticed the compact car as it drives past us. I'm still looking at the trees when I hear my girlfriend say, ""That guy can't drive.""  
  
I look at the car now, and see it make a 12-point turn, trying to turn around. There's plenty of room for a 3-pointer or even a 2, if you're a decent driver. The car, a red sub-compact, finally finishes turning around. It drives up in front of us and stops, engine still running.  
  
I'm wondering what's going on when the passenger window rolls down (the drivers side is opposite of us). There's a weird looking guy in the drivers seat and no one else. I notice he's missing teeth and has strange eyes. He says something but I can't really hear what it was, as it seemed like he slightly revved the engine when he said it. So I ask, ""I'm sorry, what was that? I couldn't hear you.""  
  
He asks something again, but I still can't hear him. It's like the engine revs every time he talks. So I stand up and walk over to the passenger side window so I can hear him better. My ex follows me.  
  
I get to the window. The weird looking guy asks, ""Do you know where Main Street is?""
  
Hmm. Main street. Where is there a Main Street in my town? I can't think of one. I ask him if he means one of the main roads, which has a name similar to Main Street.  
  
He thinks for a moment, repeating the name of the road I mentioned in a questioning manner. Like he's confused by this.  
  
""No, no, Main Street,"" he says.  
  
Still unable to think of where this might be. My town is a barrier island. I know it like the back of my hand. I've lived there for years. I mention another main road. Again I get the same response.  
  
At this point, my ex starts giving him direction finding advice, like maybe try a gas station or something? That's when I look away from the car window for the first time since we started the conversation.  
  
BAM! It hits me like a ton of bricks. I mean, it was like a physical hit. I'm looking at the trees again and it's like the acid turned back on. As if someone hit a switch that I hadn't even realized was turned off. Patterns flowing through the trees, ect.  
  
I look back in the car. The switch turns off. Suddenly I'm sober again. And now I'm noticing it. I look back up. Slammed with the acid feeling. Back in the car. Sober, normal mode.  
  
Now I'm starting to finally pay attention. Why is everything sober-normal when I look at this guy, but not when I'm looking away?  My mind is trying to tell me something, but what? I realize something is very wrong.  
  
The whole time I was processing this, the guy was watching me, while talking to my ex.  
  
I look back in the car, and notice for the first time, shiny black material covering every inch of the inside of the car. The seats, the dashboard, the floors. Everything.  
  
""What the hell is that?"" I'm wondering. I look closer. It's black plastic. Then I see the knife. A wicked, long hunting knife, sitting on the center console.  
  
Oh, fuck me. I finally look back at the guy. He's been watching me realize what's really going on. And he has this **look**. Like, ""I know, that you know, something is very wrong here"".  
  
And for the first time, I really **see** what I'm looking at. His eyes are completely dead. they look like a fishes eyes after you've cleaned and gutted it. Only I can literally **feel** that it's us he wants to gut. It's like black tendrils of pure evil are radiating off him, caressing me.  
  
I shiver and that's when he says it.  
  
Interrupting my ex, he says, ""Wanna go for a ride?""  
  
The menace and death in his voice is palpable. I grab my ex and start backing away.  
  
""No thanks, man. We have to go,"" I say.  
  
""You sure? Go drink a few beers? Come on, let's go for a ride,"" The smile he has when saying this is indescribable, in it's malevolence.  
  
I say, still backing my ex and I away, ""No, please. We have to go home."" I'm terrified at this point. I'm practically praying that he doesn't get out of the car, with the knife, since I'm unarmed.  
  
He gives me one last look, the scariest, dead eyed look yet, and says, ""Well, you be careful now.""  
  
He drives away. My first thought was, ""Death just passed us by.""  
  
What was a guy, with black plastic covering every inch of his car, doing asking some kids (we were like 18 at the time) directions at like 3 in the morning? For a street that doesn't exist (there is no main street in my town, I later checked). Why did he have a huge knife? Why did he try to get us to go for a ride? What would have happened if we did?  
  
To this day, I'm convinced that he would have killed us both, and probably worse. 
  
It should also be noted that the next day I told a friend a little about the incident. Not much, just that we met this serial killer and he was in a red subcompact car and tried to get us to go for a ride, in the middle of the night.  
  
That night, well after the evacuation order was in effect, my friend was walking to someone's house for a hurricane party. He was nervous because of what happened to my ex and I, so brought a big knife himself. He was also a teenager. It was around the same time at night when the same guy, in the same car, stopped him, still asking directions to ""Main Street"".  
  
My friend, who was completely sober, saw the plastic (I hadn't mentioned this part to him) and the knife and freaked. He pulled his own knife and told the guy that he knew the kids the guy had talked to last night, and to fuck off.  
  
My friend said he got the same scary ass vibe from the dude. Same dead, fish eyes.  
  
The guy tried to play it off, like he didn't know what my friend was talking about. He even tried to calm my friend down with the offer of drinking some beer. My friend kicked the car and waved his knife, and the guy drove off. I'm really glad I warned my friend a bit, because who knows what would have happened if I hadn't? People are too trusting in a small town like that.  
  
What's this crazy fucker doing in an evacuated or near evacuated town, asking kids about streets that don't exist, and trying to get them to get in the car and drink beers, while his car is covered in plastic and he has a giant knife? Being a serial killer, that's what. 
  
**TL;DR is at the top.**

1344481586.0	xx47p	Cable Man that knew too much	jaleigh	232	42	30	"This story happened to my family, specifically to my mother. 


My family had been having some issues with our new television. It was over heating, and the picture had been coming in and out with lines. My step father (not knowing too much about television sets) called Comcast to come check out the issue for us, yet he didn't specifically describe what had been going on at all.


The next day my mom had been home by herself, my baby sister who was 2 at the time, and the dogs. We live on a farm kind of in the middle of no where. The cable man arrives and is driving an unmarked white pickup truck, and wearing an uniform with no logos. As soon has he pulled up our 2 dogs started going ballistic, &amp; the dogs never bark at anyone &amp; are extremely friendly most of the time. 

The man got out of his truck as my mom and sister greeted him outside, instantly my mom said that she had a horrible feeling. He started to describe to her the exact problem our television had been having, without being told. Instead of going inside the house to take a look he stayed outside and used a simple ladder to a power box and my mom couldn't tell, but he didn't seem to be doing much. 

Later the man leaves without saying goodbye, asking for payment, etc. 

That evening my mother is telling us about the strange experience she had, and how strange the man was when the phone rings. 
It was comcast saying that they were so very sorry for the deley, and that they would be sending someone out to look at our television. My step father told them that someone had already been out today, and they were surprised, as they had no record of anyone having been out. 

The tv worked fine for another week and started the issues again and when a repair man arrived, his truck, uniform, and everything was marked. He asked to come inside, checked everything out, and fixed it. Had us sign papers, and everything was fine. 


Were not sure who the man was that visited our home, or how he knew so much. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1342118903.0	wgex2	With a name like Norman, what can't go wrong?	The_Schield	225	38	33	"This subreddit far surpasses nosleep in my opinion. So I figured, why not post my own little experience?

A decade ago, both of my parents worked for this moving company. The warehouse is in an awful part of the city, where there are often gunshots heard, hard drugs sold, and people hurt. So naturally, as an eight-year old boy, I had to go with them frequently to the office, including on weekends because they often have to assist customers.

Next to the warehouse, lived a man named Norman. He seemed like a normal man, a little shorter, chubbier, glasses, white hair. He looked like he was big into cars and automechanics. He also was a very avid drinker, and had recently lost his wife a few months prior.

My Dad was driving a truck, with a cramped backseat, where my friend and I were sitting. I was behind my Dad who sat in the driver's seat. 

We were heading down the alley that separated Norman's house from the warehouse. As we turned the corner, Norman was standing ominously on the curb, wiping his hands with an oil rag, with a toothpick hanging loosely between his lips. He gave an apathetic wave to my Dad, who pulled over next to the curb, and the two began talking. 

As a parent, my Dad found it necessary to talk about me in the latest play at school. I was Napoleon Bonaparte. As he says that, I remember Norman laughing, and saying, ""Is that so?"" He then reaches back behind my Dad's seat and wraps his calloused and thick hand around my throat, while maintaining his sick laugh. He squeezes sharply.

All the while, I have no idea what to do--I would feel **rude** if I freaked out on it, and my friend who is sitting accross from me, is just staring. I figured he thought that the grip wasn't very strong, and it looked like a simple caress, but the squeeze tightened. I felt a warm, sharp feeling ascend in my throat. I couldn't breathe. My Dad must've figured he was rustling my hair like with a 'proud' intention. His hand around my throat must have lasted  around 10 seconds before tears started exploding out of my eyes and I began frantically smacking his hand off. I was wailing and put my head in my hands. 

My Dad: Oh, he must just be shy.

Norman said, ""Oh, I understand,"" with a sarcastic chuckle. They said their farewells, and my Dad began driving off. I lift my head and look out the back window. Norman is staring at me with a look of extreme anger. His teeth are gritting and his eyes are flaring. He then lifts his hand to a simple little wave, and smiles. I break down again and start sobbing.

I told my Dad later about how he was choking me, and he said I was just exaggerating. Ever since, I avoid going down the alley near Norman's house. Sorry for it beign somehwhat short; there isn't much else to say about him. No one knows anything.


EDIT: You bet your ass my father is a poor one. He has problems of his own. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1337580880.0	tx5nv	Picked out of traffic by a lunatic off his meds	SamuelLBronkowicz	217	28	20	"I was visiting family in Erie, PA, USA over Labor Day Weekend 2005 (the weekend preceding the first Monday in September, for the non-Americans).  I had some time to kill, so I had lunch at a locally famous hot dog shop and then went for a leisurely drive around Presque Isle State Park.  I had the cruise control set at just under 30 mph and the radio tuned to the local classic rock station...basically just lost in my head having a completely happy and mellow drive.

A little past the midway point, I watched a big pickup truck (like an F-250 or something) suddenly pull out of traffic and into a big, empty dirt and gravel parking area, gunning his engine and spinning up all kinds of dust.  No big deal, I thought...just some redneck showing off.  It happens all the time.  He did a big loop and then made a straight line back towards the road, right into my path.  I had my foot over the break ready to stop, but he slammed on his brakes in time and stopped a few feet from my car.  It was a dick move, but it happened so fast and I'd been in a really good mood, so I didn't even think to flip him off.

He pulled back onto the road and immediately started tailgating me.  At first I figured he was pissed I didn't hit the brakes and let him cut me off and wanted to show it...and then he rammed the back of my car, hard enough that I knew there was damage.  I briefly considered pulling over, but I could see a massive dog (I'm guessing a mastiff) in the passenger seat in my rearview mirror and I decided that confronting an angry redneck and his bigass dog by myself was not a good idea (in retrospect, a solid decision).

I grabbed my cellphone and dialed 911.  While I was talking to the dispatcher, he rammed me again *hard*...hard enough that I was slammed back into the seat and saw stars.  I realized then that he wasn't going away.  For the next few minutes, I kept one hand on the wheel and had my phone in the other, calling out landmarks to the dispatcher so the park cops would know where we were while he repeatedly rammed me (10 - 15 times in total).  Traffic coming the other direction was steady (it was Labor Day Weekend), so I didn't have an option to try to flee.

At one point, he smashed into me and kept on the gas, trying to plow my car into the Jetta in front of me while I stood on the brakes.  The asshole driving the Jetta just pulled over and let us pass, and then got right back on the road without ever calling anyone (fuck that guy).  At another point, I looked in the rearview mirror and noticed something weird:  I figured the guy was pissed at me and expected him to be road raging and animated...like hands waving or pounding on the steering wheel or something.  He was calm as could be, like he was driving to Grandma's house or something, but I saw that two fingers of his right had were pointed sideways at an odd angle.  He came at me again and I put it out of my head and worried about driving.

When the traffic coming the opposite way finally cleared enough, I hit the gas and passed the two cars in front of me.  After that he backed off and slowed way down.  The dispatcher directed me to the park office, and I pulled in there, had a serious case of the shakes, and then went inside to give my statement.  I heard a bit of the rest of it on the radio.

He raced past the first two cops who tried to stop him and crashed into the third and was taken into custody.  I steadied my hands as much as I could and wrote my statement, and then the arresting officer came up to talk to me.  I briefly told him what happened, and then he said, ""It could have been worse"" and reached behind his back and pulled a huge revolver from his waistband.  They found it on the seat when they hauled him out of his truck.  About an hour later I realized that's what I had seen when I thought I saw his fingers pointed at an odd angle...he had the gun in his hand against the steering wheel the whole time!  The officer called him ""mental"", and said he told them he was on a mission from god to kill all the ""baby-fuckers"" (we took that to mean pedophiles).

I finished writing my statement and drove back to my mother's house, stopping at the dive bar down the street for a double shot of Cuervo.  

When I called the park police for a follow-up the next day, the officer told me that he was [bipolar, schizophrenic, etc...I can't remember exactly which] and had gone off his meds.  He was committed and wouldn't be charged unless he left whatever program he was put into.  I never heard anything further, so I'm guessing he did what he was supposed to.  Two or three times in the past few years I've tried a couple of internet searches on his name out of curiosity but came up empty.

His insurance quickly paid to fix my car (they even sent an adjuster to meet me at work, complete with a $500 'please-don't-sue-us' check).  I got a crazy story out of it and an irrational fear/hatred of tailgaters (seriously, fuck all of them) and that was the end of it.

Sometimes I wonder about what happened to the guy or fantasize about beating the everloving shit out of him, but mostly I try not to think about it.

1372880448.0	1hl592	The creeper at the kindergarten	Sebzor15	216	31	11	"So this story takes place in 2001-2002 or so, back when I was 7-8 years old. I was walking home with my best friend after playing some basketball at my school when we met an odd man, who I believe was in his late 40s or so at the time. Neither of us thought much of it as we were walking past him.

But out the blue, he called for us to come help him with something. We had already passed him, and were maybe 10-15 meters away from him. For some reason, the old ""don't talk to strangers"" rule didn't pop up in my head, and I slowly started walking towards him and asking him what's the matter.

He had apparently been walking around in the forest on the left side of the footpath (the kindergarten is on the right), and had been stung by lots of thorn bushes and every small evil he could come up with, and that he thought we would believe. As mentioned above, he asked us to help him with something...

He wanted us to pluck the thorns off of his body, more specifically in his private area. As I was approaching him, he started grabbing around in his left pocket, and there it was; his genitals on display (though not nakedly, with his inside pocket covering it). He was holding out a banknote, trying to lure us in...

Luckily, I realized what was happening, and fortunately I wasn't all that close to him, and I started backing up the hill again and told my friend to run.

Some years later, there was this case on the TV; ""The Pocket Man"" (dubbed from Norwegian ""Lommemannen""). He had apparently been sexually assaulting children since the mid 70s. He looked so familiar, and even to this day I feel pretty sure that it was the same guy that my friend and I met 5 years previous."	t5_2t3t8	True
1369954216.0	1fd970	Creeped Right of the Town We Lived In	UCMCoyote	223	34	40	"So this happened to me when I was a senior in high school.  I'm a California native and my parents loved to move.  Mom was always searching for bigger and better houses and Dad supported her.  So when I was a teenager we moved from the Bay Area to the Central Valley.

Now for those of you who don't know anything about California geography, imagine that huge expanse of space between San Jose and...LA.  It's framland, its country, its not the image a lot of people have when they imagine the California life.

Anyway, we moved first to Los Banos and then to an even TINIER little town called Chowchilla.  We moved there because a golf course had just opened up with cheap, huge homes on the 'course.  This was my Mom's dream come true.  Problem was this place was in the middle of nowhere.  I'm talking an hour at LEAST to anything resembling a city.  It was a teenage social death sentence but I got over it.  

Anyway, we move in and for awhile everything is great.  Then the construction company finishes the house across the street and our new neighbors move in.  They seem like generally nice people and give off a mid western vibe and in their late 50's.  My parents, eager to make new friends, embrace them but the neighbors begin to act strange, talking about how its okay to cheat on your spouse, give your young kid alcohol, do drugs, etc.  It creeped my parents out and as such they started to pull away.

As time went on our neighbors tried to keep things friendly but kept acting weird.  They kept saying things like ""Saw ya mowing.  Your grass holding up?"" when there was clearly no one outside.  They would comment about me raising my new puppy or the fact I was inside the house and working on homework assignments at the table ""Saw  your boy at the dining room table.  He in trouble?""  It was all kind of strange but we played it off.  

Then one day I'm home alone sick and I come downstairs and walk to the front door for a moment.  Our neighbor has his front windows blinds up and I see....a telescope of some kind.  It's pointed right at our front window!

I spy through the window as he's washing his window and then watch as he lowers the blinds.  he adjusts the slats so there seems to be just enough room to peer through.  In the time we'd known him we never saw the blinds up.  Creepy. 

I tell my parents who brush it off.  This is a tiny town, who would do that?  Then one night I'm in the front room reading because it had really soft pillows and our window blinds are open.  I see a flash of light and quickly look up to see the silhouette of a man.  A light had clicked on in m neighbors front room and he had been standing there.  When the light triggered he quickly moved to the side like he had been caught.  I play it off like I had seen nothing and go back to reading and the light clicks off.  Ten minutes go by and I turn off the light and step away from the window and peer out of a second window by our front door.  I see the blinds move where that telescope thing should have been!

Again I tell my parents but they tell me to just ignore it and don't talk to the neighbor.  For awhile nothing really happens, but the rest of the neighborhood begins to hang around with this creeper family and we slowly start to lose friends.  We find out he's been spreading rumors about my family. ""You know their daughter doesn't go to school?""  ""The mother works out of the home, she must be a whore,"" etc.  We ignore it as best we can.  

Then one night, the Saturday right before school was starting up, they throw a party in their front driveway.  My room, and my sisters room, faces the street and we could hear people and music and we ignore it...until 3 AM.  

By now I'm trying to sleep, I have to be in Fresno in the morning, and I get up and see my little sister is awake, annoyed, and can't sleep.  I decide that....I'd had enough.  Without waking my parents up I called the police.  I reported a noise disturbance and asked if someone could come by.  I was a stupid kid and maybe I didn't do the right thing but I had enough and my parents weren't doing anything.  

The police come and talk, then drive off.  The moment the cops are gone we hear shouting ""F*ck YOUR NEIGHBORS"" and other things, mostly a play on my family's last name.  

By now the noise is loud enough my parents get up and the neighbor is shouting at my sister (who he can see in her now open window) to take her top off (she was 12). 

My mom grabs the camcorder and records and It takes everything I have to stop my Dad from running outside to knock this guy's lights out.  

Things get weird from here on out.  We file for a restraining order and then we start seeing our neighbor everywhere.  He's at my Dad's work, at my school (randomly) they're following us into places we go out to eat, etc.  My Mom caught our neighbor holding our mail once.  he said he found it on the ground.  

Some days he would just be standing at his window, blinds up, hands in his pockets now looking at the house. Other times he would be in his driveway polishing his gun, and it really creeped my parents out.  He always leered at my sister and she claimed he pointed the gun at her window when she was peeking out.  

When we found the lock to our backyard broken we decided to move.  This man had been in our business, making our lives weird as hell.  It's not a huge creepy story but...yeah, I have no fond memories of Chowchilla California.  "	t5_2t3t8	True
1367966315.0	1dw5dh	Let's park around the corner.	cateatinghands	226	35	23	"My neigborhood when I was a teenager was nothing if not creepy as fuck. There were break ins and rapes and the occasional gang shooting but I usually felt relatively safe being that my house was in anyone near the police stations direct line of vision.

 But at night that didn't usually matter. On this specific evening I got the usual creepy cat calls and propositions from the lovely gentlemen mistaking my 15 year old non-provacatively dressed self for a Hooker. But then there was creepy macgee. Don't know this middle aged Hispanic mans name so that's my best guess.

 What I do know is that he followed me home from a bus stop in his car at 9 pm ever so slowly, doing one of two things, one being that he was preparing to help me out should harm befall me in this dreadful neighborhood, and two being the he was preparing to ever so creepily demand I get in his car so he can park around the corner to sexually assault a minor. Well it was definitely the latter.

I told him very politely to leave me alone. Over and over. So when he didn't, I did what my teenage brain demanded and that was to run home and get my dad to kick this guy in the mouth. He followed close behind telling me to get in, that I should accept his advances and put my head in his lap. I got to my door and slammed it. Locked it. And found out my dad was no where to be found. Meanwhile this guy is parked outside my window staring at me.

 So I did what any reasonable human being would have done. I grabbed a huge ass butcher knife and just when this guy was getting out of his car I ran after him phone in one hand dialing 911 and knife slashing the air in front of me with the other. Screaming like a banshee, I ran fast as I could at his car. 

He got in his car and drove away faster than anyone I've ever seen. May not have been the smartest thing to do but I never saw that creep again.."	t5_2t3t8	True
1349746649.0	11679z	Beachcomber pedophile don't know shit about shells.	mannfan9292	236	43	22	"Finally, a subreddit where I can tell this story!

I was six when my family went on vacation in Fort Myers, Florida. We were at the beach. At the time I was hooked on National Geographic specials about the ocean so I was like a kid in a candy store. All the sealife fascinated me and I was having a fantastic time looking at shells and running around in the surf. My parents were/are chill about letting my sister and I run wild, we needed to tucker ourselves out anyway. 

30 yards away from my parents, I found a conch egg sac in the surf. I'd never seen one before! They're [cool-looking things](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stilljojo/2359693720/), so I must have been poking at it for a few minutes before I noticed the man behind me. He had dark hair and a tan, must've been in his 30s; I didn't really look at him because I sucked at eye contact. He bent down to my level and started feeling the conch sac with me.

""Como te llamas?"" he asked. I couldn't understand him because he was mumbling. I asked him to repeat himself.

""Como te llamas? Your name. What is your name?"" I gladly told him and asked for his name. He said something that sounded like ""Enrico"". I was excited to be making friends on vacation. 

""____. That is a pretty name."" He kept feeling the conch sac with one hand. With his free hand he stroked the top of my hand with his thumb. ""Do you like the shells?""

""Yes, seashells are cool,"" oblivious me replied, ""But this is an egg sac."" What a dummy.

""There are shells farther up on the beach. Let me show you."" He motioned for me to go near his towel and cooler, up on the drier part of the sand. This guy wasn't very smart. Only the lame broken shells are on that part of a beach. Even though Enrico was dumb, he was nice, so I decided to go tell my parents that I made a new friend.

""Come meet my family!"" I told him. He looked panicky. I ran to where my parents were sunbathing.

""Mommy, Daddy, I made a friend! He wants to show me some seashells!"" I turned around but Enrico wasn't at the surf. He was hurrying in the direction of the parking lot. How rude. Enrico was a bad friend.

Amazingly, I didn't get a sick feeling in my tummy at all during the encounter. I was terrible at picking up social cues; even something as inappropriate as the hand stroking wouldn't register with me. When I finally remembered the incident in my teens, HOHBOY. My dorkiness sure saved my hide that day."	t5_2t3t8	True
1374650348.0	1ixymv	The creepiest guy I have ever met.	DanniGat	225	34	52	"Reading through these for the past few weeks has made me decide to share some of my experiences with creepy people. Now let's start with the fact that I'm a big guy, and am generally fearless (or stupid if you ask my family). 6'3, and broad in the shoulders, and my only real defect is that my knees bend the wrong way due to a sports injury, yes that hurts as much as you think it does, so running is something I'm not very good at, and something I only do if I have too. It takes a lot to put me on edge, but when it does, its generally not something to laugh about.

The person that will forever haunt my slumbering moments I met when I was just out of high school. I didn't have a car and the concept of 'public transportation' is about as foreign here as the concept of letting strangers off the street into your house and offering them food is most other places in the country. So I walked anywhere and every where that was within 15 miles. I was working at a fast food restaurant that was about a 45 minute walk from my house, and was usually working a 5pm-1am shift. I personally loved that shift, it was usually quiet when I got out of work, and I could just walk and think and listen to the sounds of the night. That all changed after I met this person. I was walking home like normal, uniform shirt thrown over my shoulder, enjoying the feel of the breeze. I saw someone cross the street about 300 yds (~100m) in front of me, but all I could see was the silhouette against the front porch light of a house down the road, we have a grand total of about 6 street lights on the back roads in the county, so its usually very dark and very hard to see at distances. 

Something about him just seemed off, I thought I saw him holding a knife, but then I thought, its dark and my mind is just trying to scare me so I cautiously took a step forward, reaching into my pocket and gripping my pocket knife. As I get closer to him I can sort of see his slightly darker shape against the black pine trees behind him. I know I can see a knife at this point, and my mind clicks, that he isn't walking like a normal person. It's almost like he's walking crouched down. I'm not sure what to do, he's between me and home. The back roads don't connect to each other and I know the homeless people live in the woods around here, some of them are ok, others... aren't all there. It was a grab bag of which you got and I don't like the odds. 

My brain is screaming at me to do something, but I'm not sure what I should do, so I stand and watch as he gets closer. He gets to within probably 100 ft(~30m) of me before I hear him saying something, I can't make it out but I can hear him making some noise. I can also see he is swinging something around in his other hand, but again, it's dark, its hard to see. I back off the road a little and put the drainage ditch between us, but never take my eyes off the guy.

He gets closer and I see that he does indeed have a rather large knife, and the object he is swinging around in the other hand is a dead cat. The warning lights are going off all over the place in my head, but I still don't know what to do, I'm just hoping that a car will drive by, I'd even have taken a sheriff's deputy at that point. He gets across the street from me and stops. I can hear him really well now, it almost sounded like he was chanting, or reciting a verse over and over again. He turned his full body to face me and just roared at me at the top of his lungs. I booked it towards home. 

Looking over my shoulder every turn, and he was always there behind me. I ran faster than I think I ever have before, and he was with me pace for pace, swinging his knife and dead cat at me every step of the way. I'm not about to lead him to my house though, my mom and sister are home alone, my dad being out of town for work. I run as fast as I can passing the road I live on, and as long as I can but I can feel the burn and the pain, and the wobble that forecasts my knee giving out. I turn look over my shoulder and he's still there, a little further away, but still there. I try to make it to a friend's house that I know is home and most likely still awake, but about fifty feet from his fence I feel the pop, the grind, and the intense pain as my knee goes. I fall forward, grabbing my knees and trying to curl into a ball the pain is so intense. I hit the ground with my shoulder and roll, I remember why I was running and look behind me. He was no where to be seen.

I started crawling towards his fence, getting back on my feet and running as fast as I could hobble, and jumped over the fence before collapsing on the other side again as I landed on my leg. Shouting and crawling across his yard I start beating on the door and side of the house until my friend comes to the door and bolt inside and slam it behind me just as his very irritated father comes down the stairs. They both stop short when they notice how freaked out I am, his father always commented on how stoic I am. I explain what happened to them, and they both look at me like I'm speaking in tongues. I go through it all twice for them before my friend agrees to drive me home. I was watching the entire way, I never saw him. I figured he had ran into the woods or something. We got home and he waited till I was inside and locked the door before he left. 

I changed clothes, got in the shower and stayed there until the water went cold trying to wrap my head around everything. I eventually calmed down and finally laid down to go to sleep around 5 am. Something knocked on my window, at first I thought it was just my imagination. Then it happened again so I went to look out. He was in my window smiling. I shouted and woke everyone else up and called the cops, but they didn't show up for at least half an hour by which time he was long gone. I couldn't sleep for a month, I stopped walking home from work, and I started carrying more than just a pocket knife if I had to walk alone outside after dark. I still have trouble sleeping at night. I haven't ever seen him again. But I swear sometimes I can feel him watching when I'm outside at night. 

TL;DR Creepy guy chased me for several miles, swinging a dead cat and a knife. Got a ride home from a friend after fucking up my knee, and the guy knocks on my window with a 'Here's Johnny!"" smile."	t5_2t3t8	True
1373319971.0	1hw4hp	Met the creepiest guy on my way home from work	arvizpew	231	45	37	"This will be pretty long, so excuse me. :D
**INTRODUCTION**
So I used to work at a McDonald's in one of Berlin's worst areas (For those who want to know - it's called Hermannplatz) which is known to have a severe problem with drugs - I had to regularly wipe blood off the toilets and bathroom sinks (also: syringes every other day)

This one night (November 1st 2010) i had a shift from 2pm to 10pm and, as I happened to get along quite good with my co-workers and supervisors, I stayed a little longer to just pass the time.

So at 12am I finally decided to leave when I noticed that my public transit ticket had run out and I didn't have any money or credit cards with me for obvious reasons. A co-worker offered to give me some money for a ticket just so I'd get home safely. I just shrugged it off and set out to what seemed like an odyssey.

**THE ACTUAL STORY**

I left the district without any weird incidents, but after about an hour of walking I took the wrong intersection and found myself in a street without any apartments - just some storage buildings and repair shops.  I was listening to music, when this guy walked past me into the other direction. I didn’t mind him until he suddenly walked besides me and said something. I took my headphones off and asked what he said &amp; he was like “Give me your phone.” For about a minute or two I stayed pretty calm telling him, that no way in hell I’d give him my phone, luckily he stayed rather peaceful as well.

When the headlights of a car turned up like 100m away I did what I thought was the cleverest decision at that point – I ran onto the street and hoped it would stop for me. It didn’t, instead it manoeuvred around me, can’t blame the driver.

That’s when I knew that shit had hit the fan and I just started running mindlessly while occasionally turning my head to see whether the guy was trailing me – he was and he also was closing in on me. So I just stopped and shouted at him that he’s free to take my phone, as long as he leaves me be.

What followed now was some of the weirdest shit I ever experienced. He took my phone saying that I will have to stay with him because he needs someone to talk to. So we started walking the street up and down. He talked about how both of his parents died, later he retconned this by telling me that his father was the head of a local Hell’s Angels club. Also he told me that he and his girlfriend lost their child due to complications during the pregnancy and because of this he started robbing people (What kind of reason is this?!) &amp; I should feel happy because the last person he robbed didn’t have any clothes left. That’s when I knew that he was just trashtalking to intimidate me so I would not go to the police afterwards. 

He was pretty gentle with me, never touching me or whatever, but it was enough for me that he was about 20cm taller than me (I’m 1.70 so that’s not that hard) he mostly talked about his fucked-up life (which most likely was all lies), never letting me speak apart from when he asked me how old I was (I lied to invoke some pity in him) and what my name was (lied as well, you wouldn’t want a person that might be dangerous in a very creepy way to know your real name). For a moment, when he wanted to see my wallet and found my ID I thought it’d get pretty ugly. But after shouting at me for about 5 minutes who I thought I was to lie at him, he calmed himself down again.

At this point we had been walking the freaking street up and down for about 2 ½ hours, while I had to listen to the same shit over and over. When he finally told me that he would leave now, but I had to wait for his bus with him (how mean is that?!). As we stood there at the bus stop he again tried to intimidate me by recounting again on his undead Hell’s Angels father, but also by saying that he was the member of some gang that apparently is not unknown to Berlin police.

When, finally, the bus arrived – he did the weirdest thing by asking me whether I had a contract or a prepaid phone. When I told him that it was contracted, he took out the sim-card &amp; gave it to me, saying that if we ever were to meet again, he’d give me some of the money he earned with the phone (which had a cracked display btw).

End of the story was that he left, I left and when I got up the next day to tell my parents about it, I burst out in tears and we went to the police – he was never arrested.

**TL;DR – Due to a chain of unfortunate circumstances I was basically held hostage for about 3h just so the guy could take my phone and talk to me about his fucked up tell-tale life.**

1367431697.0	1dhu9x	"""That isn't part of the deal"""	sqwjsh	241	54	21	"I'm a 20 year old girl in college somewhere in the wild concretes of Pennsylvania. Around November of 2012, myself and friends were looking for a new domicile to move into in June of 2013. 5 of us decided to all look together, even though city zoning doesn't allow more than 4 unrelated people to live at the same address (archaic prostitution laws?). We all went however, just to look and shop around. 
We went into the housing situation late as shit. Usually, we start around August, but for some reason had put it off this time. In any case, one of us had contacted a landlord to set up a look-and-see. We met him outside the property at the designated time. He had a pony tail and was past the point of thinking it might be cool. Dude was at least 60, and awkward. But landlords, since the middle ages, have always been somewhat slimy. We began to look at the house.

The house was gorg. Not far from campus, right near some sweet pizza joints; location was sublime. The house itself was maintained very well. As we entered, we were floored by the large kitchen, living room, and basement areas. There were some of the current residents in the home while we looked around. They said utilities were alright, neighbors were chill, all around decent. The landlord said simple greetings to each girl, and we moved upstairs to see the bedrooms. 

All of us went in sort of separate directions. There were three bedrooms, the largest one with a girl sitting in a computer chair talking to us about the random bullshit one does when poking through a stranger's room. Myself and one roommate (K) walked into the hallway connecting the rooms. K saw a tapestry and thought, ""what a nice tapestry"". She then went to lift it while examining it, and behold, found what appeared to be the door to the attic. Just as we turned around, this landlord was standing there. K asked, ""is this the door to the attic?"" To which this bespectacled, pony-tailed ghoul said in a sinister fashion, ""That isn't part of the deal."" (Yes, it was like a movie.) 

One girl, J, had stayed behind talking to the girl in the big room. The landlord started to usher us down the steps, strangely, and called for J to come with him to look at the parking situation. 
Our troop is almost fully outside, when the landlord calls for J again, insistently. J rushes down the steps, and I immediately felt like the atmosphere had been altered. J seemed unnerved and anxious as this landlord man was talking about all the parking possibilities. We thanked the man for his time, each of us introspectively thinking ""Why would he still have a pony tail, it's 2012"", and made our way down the alley toward the house I'm currently in.
J was walking very quickly and looking back several times. Once we had walked for maybe 3 minutes, quite far from the house, J told us what the girl had said-

(From what I best remember of her paraphrase):
""Don't live here. Please don't let your friends say they'll move in or even keep talking to this guy. He lives in the attic. He won't tell you. He didn't tell us. I can't even believe he left you alone in here with me (probably thrown off that 5 people were there instead of the regular 4), but please. We have no idea what he's seen or heard or what weird shit he has around the house.""

Reeling, the 4 remaining of us were equal parts horrified, grossed out, and angry. Like, what the fuck dude? I don't know what the girls living there were doing about it, but it didn't seem like much. We were significantly creeped out and didn't respond to any calls from him, except his first, saying we weren't interested, yo.

1363822204.0	1ap3ss	The girl at the end of the driveway	jenn_jf	229	39	46	"I am 22 years old, and I live in Toronto, Canada, In a nice suburban area. When I was about 18 years old I had a house party at the same house that I am living in now. My parents went to our cottage to spend the weekend. It was a beautiful summer evening and there was about 25 (maybe more) people here. We were all drinking and being obnoxious teenagers as expected. Around 12am the police showed up. I'm sure it had a lot to do with the fact that me and my ex were in my driveway having a screaming war. The officers didn't ask about alcohol or anything like that. Just told everyone who was not spending the night to leave, and if they had to come back there would be a problem.

 After the cops and majority of the guests finally left I told everyone to keep the party inside because I didn't want it to loud outside. I decided I needed some fresh air and some time to myself after the events of night. I went out into my backyard and sat on a patio chair. Leaning my head against the wooden fence behind me I began to doze off. 

My friends Kristyna and Rami thought it would be a good idea to sneak up on me and scare the crap out of me. I let out a huge scream. I'm still not sure how long I had been sleeping for. It couldn't of been that long. About 20 seconds after my scream we heard aanother scream come from somewhere else. It was almost like a delayed echo. It was the scream of a female for sure, and it sounded like it was coming from down the street. 

We started walking towards the part of my backyard that had a chain link fence so that we could see the road and down my street. It was very dark probably around 1:30am and the street was very dimly lit with street lights. I was just about to say it must have just been someone walking by and they wanted to be funny or something, when Rami pointed out a girl standing about 20 feet away, at the end of someones driveway just staring at us. She was wearing a short black dress, had long dark hair, and her skin was so pale it almost seemed to glow in the dark. 

I suggested that it looked a lot like our friend Laura, who the last I saw was extremely intoxicated. I thought maybe she got out of the house and was trying to mess around with us. Kristyna volunteered to go inside and look for Laura, while me and Rami stayed in the back yard trying to figure out who this girl was. I screamed again, to see if I would get the same response, and I did. She screamed back almost immediately.

 I then called out ""Laura?"" and she responded with ""Yes!"" Rami and I decided we needed to approach her and try and get her back into the house safely before the cops came back and we all got into serious shit. We got about half way to this girl and she still stood there like a stone. She did not move, she did not make any noise, just stood there starring at us. I began to think to myself, this can't be Laura, because if it was she wouldn't just be standing there like she was. We still couldn't make out the face. 

Next thing I know I hear Kristyna calling out for us. ""Laura is inside passed out!"" Those words hit me like a ton of bricks and I froze. All of a sudden this mystery girl begins cackling so loud that Rami and I both jumped. I mean, she was laughing so loud it was unbelievable. She then turned around and ran up the driveway towards the back of the house, continuing with this crazy, scary laughing. When she was finally out of site, I could still hear this laughing like she was still 10 feet away from us. We turned around and started power walking back to the house, when we were startled with loud banging that sounded almost like metal garbage cans smashing together. This girl really creeped me out so I went inside, locked all the windows and doors, and hid under my covers. 

To this day I have no idea who she was. What young girl in their right mind would just stand there by herself when 2 strangers are approaching her. One of the strangers being 6'2 and 210lbs. She was either really brave and just wanted to have some fun with us, she was drunk or on some serious drugs, Or she was something else that just creeps me right out to think about. The weirdest event about this story, is that the next day I saw the man who lives at the house where the girl was standing and I asked him if he heard or saw anything out of the ordinary between 1 and 2am. He said he heard nothing. It seems almost impossible that she was so close to his house and was so loud and he didn't hear.

1348953906.0	10olyp	Old Man Harasses an Underaged Me and a School Officer has a Moment of Awesome.		236	46	29	"Some backstory, I recently moved with my mother to a very low class apartment complex. The sort that is government subsidized and you hear fights, bass, and yelling all night. I was 16 at the time and we had one small dog (Jack Ass Daniels, our Jack Russel Terrier) with us and for the first few months it was very nice. My mom was scared of our downstairs neighbor, a tattood man who looked straight out of jail and lived with his mum but he actually was incredibly sweet. He helped us move in furnature and gave us cookies for the holidays.

The apartments are set up with 8 apartments in a building, four on the bottom floor and four on top. I was on the second story, front apartment. Behind our apartment (still on the second story, we shared a wall) was a man who lived alone. I never saw him at first, he drove a bright yellow Prius, but the first time I met him was terrible.

It was about 05:45 and I was taking my dog out to go to the bathroom before I left for school. I transferred to a school far away as my old one had to much crime and I nearly got knifed so we had a rather long drive. I was about 10 feet from the bottom of the stairs and all of a sudden the old man comes out of his apartment and stops about half way down his stairs. I look up long enough to say a polite hello and then look away as my dog sniffed around.

He returned the hello with a ""How are you?"" and I respond in kind, nothing really felt odd and I guess I didn't suspect anything to bad from him because he was really old and slowly the questions became more personal. He asked me my name and he told me how he used to date a woman in New York with that same name. He said I was much prettier than she was, and 16 year old girls with insecurity issues dig that so I didn't object.

He had started to inch down the stairs towards me, my dog pretty much ignored as he finally found a spot and went about his work. Eventually he invited me in his house for some breakfast. This is where I started to get scared, I never thought someone would make advances like this to me since it was winter and I was bundled up in a thick coat and didn't look that attractive at the moment. I said no, taking a step back as he took one forwards. I eyed the bottom of my stairwell but I felt like I was assuming to much. I had real problems in asserting myself at this time. His offer escalated into inviting me in for champagne, I told him I was underaged. He aksed again, I repeated three times that I was underaged but thank for the generous offer (I should have just said I wasn't interested).

He told me it's okay because it's pink champagne. This is when I put my foot down, and sadly it was mainly because he assumed that I would like pink things because I am female. I said no and I ran with my dog back to my apartment and instantly relayed the story to my mother. She didn't believe me, she didn't think anyone actually lived in the apartment since we never see or really hear anyone. ""The only people I have seen are employees babe. Now stop this nonesense and let's take you to school.""

I went to school and I was angry. Angry at my mother who thought I was lying. But I had someone on my side. If any of you are familiar with the D.A.R.E program it's when a cop comes to elementary schools and teaches you about drugs and alcohol. He actually ended up working at the middle school my mother worked at and when I was there bringing my mom something (don't remember what it was) I told him about it.

I ended up bringing him a picture of his license plate and he took me to the station to file a full report. The man was 76 and had been doing the same thing to all the little girls in this development. The officer who took me to file the report went to talk to him and he gave a bunch of excuses ""I just had heart surgery!"", ""My eyes are bad!"", ""I didn't know she was 16!"" (I only said it three times, very clearly).

He never spoke to me again but whenever I was outside he would watch me through his blinds. It was so uncomfortable I ended up promising my mom if she took the dog out I would not only do the dishes but clean the entire apartment. She agreed and all and eventually apologized for not listening but from now on when I have problems I go to my dad first. He actually believes me."	t5_2t3t8	True
1374674499.0	1iyf94	The unknown man	BluePlease	241	55	44	"So i live in a kinda rural suburb area where there are a lot of houses, but there is like 2 acres of land between each house. It is basically the country. Anyway, i was about 14 at the time this happened (im 17 now) but I would play ManHunt with my friends around my neighborhood, which was pretty big.

 So we started playing manhunt, which is just like hide and go seek but more intense cause you run around a lot more and shit, and my friend was it. So there is about 15 of us playing and 1 person it, keep in mind that it is like 12 at night, we start to run and break off into groups. Everyone leaves to go to hide in different places and Me, my brother, and my cousin are together going to a area of trees that is a really good hiding place.

 So we get there and hide for about 5 mins. We get restless and start to be loud. which is the opposite of what youre supposed to do. We hear a noise from beside us in the forest and we all shut up and think it is our friend Dan who is it. It is pitch black so we cant really see, but we keep looking. around 5 mins pass and nothing happened, so we assume that Dan had moved on because he thought no one was here. We were all like ""Ya we rock"" and thought we were gonna win.

 My Brother said, ""its been a while, wanna go out to the street and make things more fun?"" me and my cousin said no cause we dont want to run. So we wait a bit and my cousin says he has to pee. so he goes to the back of the area and starts peeing on the tree. me and my brother are just looking around when my cousin screams bloody murder and shouts ""WHAT THE FUCK"" me and my brother turn around and see this man just standing there with the creepiest fucking smile on his face. we all scream and get the fuck out of there and start running down the street as fast as we can. About half way down the street to my house we look back while running and we see the same guy running after us. Not like running normally. I mean like pheobe running. with his arms flailing and taking huge ass leaps while running after us.

 We scream again and start running faster then I ever had in my life. This guy starts to pick up speed and we keep running, but then i look back and he is gone. so i say to my brother and cousin, that he is gone and they say lets get our dad. so we run home and we calm down after 5 mins or so, and tell our parents what happened. My cousin says he was peeing and the guy fucking grabbed his dick while he was peeing. What the actual fuck. at this point we realize that our friends are still out there playing manhunt in the dark with this creep. so we call everyone who was playing manhunt and tell them to come back to the house, cause shit was going down. 
SO after 10 mins everyone is back and we ask them if they saw him and they say no, then we ask if that was one of them playing a joke on us and they say no. so we calm down and start to clear our heads. I should mention that I live in the country and there is only a street light at every turn, so its dark everywhere. but i live on the turn in the road so i can see the road infront of my house, but only like a little bit. So all the kids are at my house and we are about to go downstairs to play some xbox or whatever, when my brother screams at the top of his lungs. We all run to him and he is standing in the front lobby staring out the window. He was frozen solid and starting point out the window. We all look and its the same guy standing under the light looking at us. We all scream and my dad, who before probably didnt believe us, started running out the door and grabbed a shovel that was leaning on the garage door in front of the house. He ran towards the guy like a bat out of hell and im guessing the guy realized he was about to get murdered by my father because he booked it back into the forest fast. My dad came back and called the police and they asked us a bunch of question about what he looked like and stuff and then they went around searching for him but couldnt find anything. 
Thats it basically, nothing really happened after that, we all fell asleep later and my dad stayed up walking around the house all night to keep us safe he said. We then stopped playing manhunt at night.

1349579588.0	112mnv	"Sure, you're a ""Meat"" Salesman, all right."	gingergypsy	217	32	35	"Unfortunately, I have had several run-ins with creepers, not exactly something to brag about, but it has made me hyper aware of who around me is a threat to my safety.

My first experience was when I was 11 years old.  My parents worked together in their own business, and were in the process of turning the garage into an in home office, but still had an office about 20 minutes from home.  Dad had to go out of town a lot but Mom was always home when I got back from school. 

One day I ended up getting sick, just a bad cold, when Dad was out of town.  Now, mom couldn't just not go to the office, she had to answer phones and such, seeing as she was the only one there.  She figured I was big enough to be on my own for a few hours, just from about 8-12.  That would be enough time to get some work done, and handle any important business.

Now, I was an only child, and really attached to my mom.  I was the kind of kid that would wait in the car while she went into the back and sit there in my seat, stick straight, fearful of everyone that walked by, sure that mom had been attacked and would never come back to the car.  Of course, that never happened, but when you are a kid, rational thinking is not your strong point.

So, mom assured me she would be back before noon, and reminded me to keep the doors locked, and to ""NOT ANSWER THE DOOR FOR ANYONE.""

So, she left, and I settled down in front of the TV watching Nickelodeon, snuggled in a blanket.

Maybe an hour later, the doorbell rings.  I am frozen on the couch, and I wait for the person to leave.  They ring the doorbell again.  

Just breathe, I tell myself, they are probably just salesmen, and will leave soon. A few minutes pass, long enough that the average person would figure, *hey, no ones home, guess I'll be on my way.*

The doorbell rings again.  This time I get up, and slink my way along the wall, to look through the cut glass panel in the center of the door.  Sick day and all, I am only wearing a tank top and panties, so I am not about to rush over to the door.

In order to see the door, I have to lean my head past the wall. As I lean out, I see a man looking through the glass.  I jerk back, and press myself against the wall, praying he did not see me, still hoping he will leave. Up till now, there is pretty much no rational reason I am freaking out, it's just someone at the door, not Jason or Freddy.

Up till now.  He sees me and begins knocking on the door and ringing the bell in earnest.  By now 5 minutes have passed.

""Open the door, honey."" He calls. ""Come on, now, open the door.""

I don't move.

""Open the door, now.""  He begins to knock louder.

I look to the door, and he is peering in at me.

BANG BANG BANG. I wince at each fist fall.

Now as a child, you are instinctually driven to obey your elders.  *He is getting really mad*, and I begin to falter, thinking perhaps I will get in trouble if I don't open the door. *Maybe he will tell my mom I was bad.*

I walk to the door with my hand outstretched, ready to open the door.  He continues telling me to open the door, sometimes firmly, sometimes in a sweet singsong manner.

At the last possible second, my instinct kicks in and I jerk my hand from the lock.

""OPEN THE DOOR. NOW!"" he yells.  ""OPEN THE F-CKING DOOR, RIGHT NOW! G-D DAMMIT, OPEN THE DOOR RIGHT NOW!""

I run back to the living room and do a little freakout dance as i try to figure out what to do.  He continues to pound mercilessly at the door, screaming obscenities, and telling me how much trouble I will be in if I don't open it.  He has now been at the door for ten minutes.

I hesitate calling my mom, I don't want to get in trouble, and I know that she is at least a 20 minute drive, and can't really help me anyways.  I remember that our neighbor two houses down is retired and she is usually home.  She doesn't really like kids, but at this point I feel like she is my only hope.  She has hawk eyes, and a pension for being in everyones business, so I am sure that she has probably already seen the truck parked out front.

In my panicked state, I can't remember her number.  *877-9887?  877-8978?*  He is now throwing his weight into the door.

*877-9878!* I grab the telephone and scramble to dial the number.

After 3 agonizing rings she answers.

""Hello, Maureen? It's Nikki.  There is a man at the door and he won't go away, he's been here a long time. He wants me to open the door.""

She tells me not to open the door, and she will be there right away.  Thinking back, I am sure she could hear him through the receiver.

I hang up and within a minute, the pounding stops, and I can hear him talking to some one.  

Maureen comes rushing into our yard, asking him, who he was, and telling him to get the hell out of here. At this point I open the door.

He is slinking towards his white pickup with a topper on the back, his hands up defensively. 

""Hey, relax lady, I am just trying to sell some meat.  I sell meat. See look at my truck.""  He keeps his hands up while moving to the truck. ""Do you wanna buy some steaks?""

""You've been selling meat to an 11 year old, for the last 10 minutes? Get the hell out of here before I call the cops!"" I had always seen her as kinda scary, but she was my savior that day.  

She ushered me back inside, and called my mother, who rushed home.  He never came back.  I am not sure if they ever called the police. I still get leery when those guys come around selling meat.



It is amazing, how manipulative these predators can be.  They know their victims, and pray on your weaknesses, waiting for you to make the one mistake that will give them access to you.  I have read many stories on here today, and the common thread I see is, *""He seemed so nice at first""*, or *""he was really charming"", ""I thought he was just overly friendly.""* They know how to talk to you to get what they want.  

Think of it like a hunter.  Hunters disguise themselves to blend in with the prey's natural surroundings, they hide their scent, and even make sounds, or use bait to attract their kill.  Remember, YOU are the prey.  Learn to listen to your instincts, and never be afraid to ""hurt someones feelings"" in order to stay safe.  Don't become an ""If only.""  *If only I had asked someone to walk me to my car.  If only I had not gotten on the elevator with him.  If only I had told my manager about his behavior.  If only I had called out for help instead of feeling embarrassed.*

Your safety is worth far more than the opinion of a stranger.  Sure, you may be wrong, perhaps they really did just need a ride home.  But what if your instincts were right?  What if I had opened that door?  Would I be telling you my story today?

1343569898.0	xcaqe	The eyes staring back at me	whengaysattack	229	41	41	"Before I tell you guys this, just know that I have this insane, irrational fear of looking out the window (at night, no less) and seeing someone else staring back at me. It usually prevents me from looking out of windows when it's dark.

Anyway, on with the story. This happened about three years ago. I was 15 at the time. It was late, around 12AM. My mom worked third shift as a nurse, and she was a single parent (and I am an only child), so I was always home alone late at night. No matter, I enjoyed the peace.

My mother had recently lost her key to the front door, so I would have to wake up early in the mornings and let her in. To stop myself from having to wake up (and lose my oh-so precious sleep), I would just leave the door unlocked. I lived in a small town, a nice neighborhood, and crime was never a discussion.

But that night changed everything. I remember going into the kitchen, making a bowl of cereal, and playing with my cats. I'm standing in the living at this point, when I hear a scratching sound at the door. The wind was blowing that night, making all sorts of sounds outside, so I didn't really pay it any attention. For some reason, though, I decided to eat my cereal over the sink--in the kitchen--only a few feet away from the front door. This was something I never did.

My cats, upon hearing the scratching sound, run to the door. I roll my eyes, thinking they are no fun to play with. The scratching sound continues, then my stomach just drops. I can't even explain the feeling to you guys. It was like my intestines just fell down lower into my stomach. I realized that it wasn't the wind making that sound.

I walk to the door and decide to peek through the blinds, just in case there were to be someone out there. (We had a french door with a glass window in the middle, with blinds covering the hole). 

I peek through the blinds, and to my horror, I see the gleaming whites of two eyes staring back at me. I see the rugged exterior of a man's face, the striking outline of his nose, the coy grin on his lips. But the eyes. I will never forget those fucking eyes. 

I dropped my bowl (which shattered on the floor) and quickly turned the deadbolt, just as there was a sudden crash on the other side. The guy was trying to break in! I rammed my feet against the wall, practically laid down on top of the door, and was able to shut and lock the deadbolt.

I locked myself in a closet, called the police, then my mom. The police showed up, didn't find anything, they left. I had a panic attack and my mom called my stepdad. He drove around and said he saw a guy walking the streets, but that was it. No one knows who it was.

The most terrifying thing is that I usually listened to my iPod on max volume, so this guy could have easily just walked into my house, harmed me in some way, and I would have never known he was inside. My bedroom was also at the back of the house, far away from the front door. I usually can't even hear the doorbell when it rings, so I would have been fucked if I hadn't decided to take my cereal over the sink that night. The thought makes me sick to this day.

To this day, I can't look outside a window at night, for fear of seeing those eyes staring back in at me."	t5_2t3t8	True
1345299864.0	yffma	The man at the window	Yuzen	226	38	63	"Hello there! This will be my second story that I've posted on this subreddit, which is quickly becoming one of my favourites. This happened to me in the summer two years ago. I was living with my mother at the time, and she'd taken herself off on vacation with a friend, so I had the house entirely to myself. This tends to be a fairly happy occurrence for me since I'm comfortable alone and could actually get to watch the TV for once (My mother is a notorious television hog) and generally could do whatever I wanted without motherly intrusion.

It was a fairly typical night for me. I'd been chilling out in my computer room (Context: I have a bedroom upstairs in the house and a room to myself downstairs that contains my computer) just playing about, chatting to some people, snacking on junk food, the usual home alone kid stuff. I think I was playing World of Warcraft back then. Hey, it was two years ago, give me a break. Now, I'm pretty bad when it comes to sleeping whenever I have nothing to get up for. My sleeping cycle goes completely out of whack and I wind up waking up at strange times and staying up til the early hours of the morning. In this case it must have been going well on 4am when this incident occurred.

I think I was grinding at the time. I usually listened to music back then when I was grinding, but I think it was between songs when I heard what sounded like a cat letting out a high pitched wail. We don't own a cat, but this in itself isn't too uncommon. There have always been a few neighbourhood cats. Sometimes they fight with each other, sometimes there's other reasons for them crying out, but I've certainly heard things like that in the past. What alarmed me about this particular sound, though, was that it was coming directly from my back garden. I was worried that two cats were going at it and were trying to fight to the death in my back yard.

Being a big animal lover (We used to own cats when we lived out in the country, and they're by far my favourite animal) I decided to go out to the back garden to try and startle the cats and make them disperse so that nothing wound up getting too hurt. I opened the door and saw a pair of reflective feline eyes look up and then bolt over the fence and off into another housing estate. But I was confused. There was only one cat. What, then, had provoked it to cry out in such a manner, as if it were hurt or scared? It was at that point that I heard the sounds of stones rattling together. Our back garden has quite a bit of gravel in it, it's a decorative sort of thing, a bit hard to describe without a picture, but you probably get the idea.

I instinctively cast my eyes in the direction that I thought the rustling had come from. Now, I'd just come out of a brightly lit house, and it was a very, very dark 4am outside. There's no real lighting near my back garden, especially not near the fence where I'd heard the sound. My eyes hadn't quite adjusted to the night, but there's no mistaking what I saw: a very human shaped shadow looming up from behind a small bush that we had growing near the fence. I had a bit of a NOPE moment and rather swiftly slammed the door shut and locked it. 

But it was 4am. I've always had a bit of an active imagination where horror is concerned. I'm the guy who sits around and reads creepypasta home alone with the lights turned out and then has rather vivid (and terrifying) dreams. I figured it was probably my imagination. It wouldn't be the first time I'd thought I'd seen something and it turned out to be nothing. At the time, the blinds on my rooms window had been taken off because they were soon to be replaced with curtains. This meant that the entire back garden was pretty much open to me if I looked out. I actually found this very disturbing and avoided looking in that direction. I've never been a fan of staring out into an unfathomable blackness at night. When I went back into my room, I took a glance out and couldn't see the shadow that I thought I'd saw when I'd been out at the back door, so I shrugged and figured it had just been a trick of the light. Back to grinding on WoW.

About twenty minutes passed before I slid back from my desk and stood up to go and fetch a drink. Just as I was heading to the door to head out towards the kitchen, something catches the corner of my eye near the window. It's meant to be unfathomable blackness, but its not. Not quite. There's a patch of something in the corner, something that my brain instantly recognises as not belonging. I paused and turned to see something that, to this day, keeps my curtains the fuck closed whenever I'm in my room at night.

There's a face pressing against the window. It's not a human face, either. Whoever it was? They had a god damn mask on. We're not talking about a goofy Halloween mask here, either. I took the liberty of searching around for a picture to reference this mask, and [here we go](http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/robot%20mask%20lg.jpg)

So, here I am, stopped dead at the door, holding my empty glass that I had been planning on filling with OJ, when I'm looking eye to eye with someone pushing their masked face up against my window, standing in my dark assed garden, at 4:20am. My heart skipped a beat. The first thing I did was break eye contact (Or what I imagined was eye contact. I couldn't really see their eyes from a distance because of the lack of light near the window) and head on through the door and into the kitchen. I placed the glass down on the table. As I did this I heard rustling. Something moving on the gravel again. This time it was loud, pronounced, heavy footsteps upon the stone. I turn to the kitchen window, and the face is there again. They've followed me. This time they slam their hands on the window along with pushing their face against it. I think I hear them say something, but I can't make it out. I notice they have gloves on, and think this couldn't be a good sign. Yeah, because a masked creeper is a good omen by itself..

I'm caught between two minds. They're around the back and it'd take them a few seconds to get around to the front of the house if I choose to bolt from the kitchen and sprint out into the cul-de-sac and reach a neighbours place. That'd be fast, but it'd be risky. I'm not all that physically fit. Not particularly fat, but I don't do a lot of physical exercise so I wasn't terribly confident in my cardio to hold up over the distance, short as it might be. What if they were just plain faster than me? What if they went inside the house after I left and stole something then vanished before the cops could show up? It wasn't like I'd have time to open the door, lock it again, then bolt! 

My other option was to phone the police then hope the nutjob doesn't start trying to smash in the window and climb through it. The window in the kitchen would have been a tough sell, but the one in my room wouldn't have been hard at all. The figure in my window was tall, and the window sill itself was low to the ground. If they wanted in, what was to stop them? Grabbing the phone, I decided I'd take my chances. I had been standing in the hallway at this point having backed the fuck away from the kitchen. I'd heard more banging on the window there and didn't want anything to do with it. At least in the hallway I couldn't see him, and he couldn't see me. I knew I could have phoned the cops then and there, but I went back into my room. Surprise surprise, there he was. I made a very obvious show of raising the phone and dialling the number, practically shouting down the phone, telling them exactly what was going on. They kept me on the line, I'm sure that is standard policy for them.

Even though this guy knows the cops are coming (I told him, very loudly) he stays there. In fact, I swear I hear laughing. Then he smashes his head against the window. I literally hear the mask cracking against the glass. It even slips just a bit and I see a receding hairline peeking into view. I figured he was a nutjob and was going to try and force his way in. I live in a fairly small town and the police aren't known for their rapid reaction times.. or maybe he just didn't care? I was desperate, and that's when I saw it: a stupid pellet gun that I'd had since I was a kid. I say stupid because the damn thing was broken and didn't even work anymore. But it looked real. Very, very real. It was a M1911 replica, I believe, and completely looked the part. It was totally hidden from the masked man's view, since it was tucked off behind my computer collecting dust.

When I suddenly grabbed it and stormed towards the window, throwing the phone to one side and holding it like Jack fucking Bauer (I was a huge 24 fan back then) and shouting like an attack dog for him to back the hell off before I blow his brains all over the floor, he seems startled, he backs off, he jumps even, and then just like that, he's gone. I was terrified, scared nearly out of my mind, but the adrenaline took hold, and I managed to make myself look big enough to freak the guy out. I guess in that moment he thought the gun was real and I actually knew how to use it. I'd taken that stance that you see people use in pretty much every serious cop/military drama. Looking back, if the guy had been smart, he never saw me load a magazine or anything.. would I really keep a loaded gun around the house? I mean, I live in Northern Ireland, not the US where that's fairly common!

The police arrived 10 minutes later (It's a good job I went for the gun ploy..) and checked the house, the garden, surrounding neighbours gardens, and the entire estate for any sign of the man at the window, but he was gone. They said he was in all likelihood some drunk teenager who'd found a leftover mask from Halloween and decided to have a laugh. I believed them at the time, it helped me feel better... but I remember that shot of the persons hairline, and I remember their build.. they were an older person. 30s or 40s. Drunk or on drugs, quite possibly, but who knows what they really wanted. I never saw a weapon on them, but they could have very easily had one. There was never any further sightings of the masked tormentor, but I can tell you this: I've never felt truly comfortable in that room when I'm in the house alone ever since, at least not in the middle of the night or the early hours of the morning. When it's pitch black out, who knows what could be creeping around outside? "	t5_2t3t8	True
1339439623.0	uwiod	"""I GOT YOU CARNE ASADA"""	walnutwhale	216	31	24	"In college I lived in a small town in Idaho. I was always a bit quirky for the area - it was very conservative and religious, I dressed strangely and was covered in tattoos. I lived in the basement unit of a duplex, and the couple who lived above me were quintessential white trash. They were constantly fighting at all hours of the night, stumbling around our shared yard wasted at 3am, and there was a steady stream of seedy characters coming and going. I complained many times to my landlord, but he was a softie and kept telling me the guy was trying to get his life together and I just needed to avoid them. 

So, I did. I didn't interact with them for months of living there. We shared a laundry room, so I would do my laundry at odd hours of the night. One night I was doing laundry and I heard the door at the top of the stairs open - from their apartment. I decided to play it cool and I continued to fold my laundy as my obviously intoxicated neighbor stumbled down the stairs and slurred a greeting to me. I politely introduced myself, and he grabbed my arm and started poking at my tattoos, rambling about all the ink he had gotten in prison. I gently pried my arm away and nodded agreement until I backed into my apartment and locked the door.

After that, I was cordial whenever I saw him. He didn't scare me, he just seemed sad, lonely, and like his life was kind of shit. Finally, after one night of non stop screaming between him and his girlfriend, his very pregnant lady moved out and left him all alone. 

Hours after this incident he knocked on my door. I opened it a little bit and he tried to push his way in. He reeked of booze. He was holding a styrofoam take out container.

**""I BROUGHT YOU CARNE ASADA""** he slurred, trying to lean into my apartment. 

**""I'm sorry... I'm a vegetarian.""** I replied, sticking my foot against the door.

He paused for a moment, looked at me, then threw the food container onto the ground. Meat chunks went flying all over my foyer. **""FUCKING FINE, BITCH. I WAS JUST TRYING TO BE NICE.""**

I awkwardly thanked him for thinking of me and told him to go drink some water. I shut the door in his face.

I didn't hear from him for a couple of days, until I was chilling on my couch playing Final Fantasy. It was a balmy summer night, so I had my windows open. Out of nowhere, I heard a phantom voice: **""I love you.""**

I paused, my nerves on edge. I wasn't sure if it was someone outside my apartment talking to someone else. Sure enough, I looked up at one of my windows and my neighbor had his face shoved against the screen, staring at me. **""Girl, I fucking love you. Let me in and let me show you how much I love you.""**

I very firmly told him to leave me alone. He argued a bit and then consented.

Again, days went by with no incident. I locked all my windows and doors and barricaded the door to our shared laundry room. Finally, I came down with a terrible case of bronchitis. I had cysts in my lungs and I was prescribed really intense steroid cough medicine. I left the house to take my dog for a walk one day and left the windows open as I was just going around the block. My cough medicine was on the kitchen counter.

When I returned, everything was as I had left it except my cough medicine was gone.

The fucker had popped my screen out and taken my cough medicine, because he needed some sort of drug fix so bad. I couldn't get a refill and I was sick weeks longer because of him. He was finally arrested two days later for trying to forge RX notes for pain killers. I ended up moving into his old apartment and I found all sorts of insane rambling letters about me in a notebook. He talked about watching me sleep through my window. 

He was just a sad man fucked up on lots of drugs, but I was really lucky he didn't try to rape me or something. I was a dumb 19 year old and found myself indestructible - if it would have happened to me today I would have called the cops in an instant."	t5_2t3t8	True
1364006593.0	1au7ji	woke up to find some guy I didn't know asleep on the floor next to me	chesterfeildsofa	217	33	34	"Based on the title, you might think I was drinking and brought home a one night stand, only to forget the next day. But no, what happened is a little bit creepier than that.
I am a female, and at the time I was 20 living at my mom's house. The house didn't have air conditioning, so I slept in the living room on the couch downstairs instead of my room on the second floor. The front door was also located in the living room, and I had a ferret that I let run around freely instead of putting in a cage. To keep him in the living room, I put a board up about waist high in the doorway leading to the kitchen so he couldn't escape. My mom also had 2 dogs that were pretty big. They looked intimidating but were big babies. Even being a huge dog, one of them didn't realize he had the power to jump over the board, so whenever someone came in the house from the front door he would just stay at the boarded off doorway and bark. 

I had been in Kentucky visiting family the week before and had just gotten home. I have a bad habit of staying up pretty late. I didn't lay down until around 3am and by that time I was exhausted and fell asleep pretty quickly.

I also forgot to lock the door.

I vaguely remember my step dad yelling at me, me sitting up and saying ""what? yeah okay"" and going back to sleep. From where my step dad had been standing, he could see the door, but not me on the couch. This was because it being so hot, I would only sleep in my underwear and didn't want someone to see me if I kicked the blanket off in my sleep.

So anyway, around 10am I wake up. I would have just gone back to sleep, but I think I was thirsty and was going to get up to get a drink when I saw him. There was a guy asleep on the floor right next to the couch. I froze, scared, trying to think of a rational excuse for this guy I didn't know being asleep next to me on the floor. After a few minutes I came to the conclusion he must have been one of my parents friends who had drank too much and stayed the night. They had friends that would do that every once in a while, but usually they would stay in another room. 

It took me about 10 minutes to work up the courage to get off the couch. Still in my underwear, I held the blanket around me as I ran as fast as I could into the other part of the house and to my mom's office where she was on the computer. I looked at her and said 
""Mom...who is that guy?""
she looked at me with a confused look and said ""what guy?""
""the guy asleep in the living room""
her eyes got wide and she said ""you don't know him?""
I said ""uh...no""
She jumped up and ran into the bedroom where my step dad was and shouted ""SAMANTHA DOES NOT KNOW THAT GUY!!!""
He jumped up, grabbed his hand gun and stormed into the living room. My stepdad is about 6'5'' and 300 pounds, so even without the gun he is pretty intimidating. He goes in the living room and I hear ""HEY, DUDE, WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?!?""

My mom called the police while my step dad made sure the guy didn't try to leave. Before the cops got there, though, he convinced my step dad that he had to use the bathroom. At first he said no, but then the guy said he was going to piss himself. The guy didn't really have to go to the bathroom as it turned out, he had meth on him and tried to flush it down the toilet.

So here's what happened while I was asleep. Around 5am, my mom's dog started going nuts in the kitchen. My step dad got up to see why he was barking and see's this guy standing in the living room. My step dad asks him who he is and the guy tells him he's friends with me. Thats when he yelled at me and I sat up and said ""yeah sure, okay"". The guy told the police when they got there that he had just gone into the wrong house while he was drunk. Another lie. All up and down our street (including my mom's car) he had stolen things from any car that was unlocked. One thing he took was some ladies bible and the collection money from kids at a vacation bible school (why someone would have this in their car, i don't know). He left the doors to all the cars wide open so it was pretty obvious someone had went through them. The police showed up and arrested him. We gave our statements and that was the end. And yes, now I make sure the door is locked before I go to bed.

About 4 months later, we see the guys face on the news. A manager from a dollar store was making a nightly deposit at the bank when the guy robbed him. He was arrested and went to jail for a while. No idea what happened to him after that.

EDIT: here is the link to the news story about him robbing the manager

1363107258.0	1a5lvn	He was a friend... (NSFW)	jordan89115	263	78	48	"I had met my ""then"" friend around October 2007. I was 13 then, and in that awkward middle school stage. His name was Trevor. He was bullying on for being fat, gross and black. I sympathized with him because I was being bullying for being fat then, so I befriended him. Everyday we talked about random things, like school, teachers, kids at school, etc. Things went well for a while. 
One day, I invited him over to my house. He introduced me to Runescape, (and honestly, who didn't play it then), and everything went well for a while. This was the first time I invited someone over, as many of my friends lived south of me and didn't know (and still don't) know where I live or how to get there. Since it was the first time, and it went well, I invited him over again. But I shouldn't have. 
It was January 12th, 2008. A Saturday. (I'm crazy good with dates by the way). We went to my basement, and he was in awe about how big my basement was. He wanted to play GTA San Andreas, since he didn't have a Playstation 2. Eventually, he got bored and wanted to do something else. He wanted to play hide and seek in the big basement. However, the strange terms were (if he finds me in 20 or so seconds) either to give him GTA SA cheats, or to give him a blowjob. 
I thought it was joke. Surely, he talks about girls all the time, so why would he want me? (I'm a guy by the way, in case you haven't noticed) Thinking he was joking, I agreed. In did find me within 20 seconds. Shit. He wanted me. I pleaded with him not to want me. I gave him the cheat code book and we got back to playing San Andreas. Hopefully, I thought, this would be the last time I would have to deal with this. But it wasn't.
Later in the night,  I created an account, and we played RS. Nothing wrong with that. He was on my desktop, and I was on my laptop. I had to leave the room to get something. When I came back, there he is, masturbating. Full out. Disgusting. I tell him to put it way. He doesn't, and I pull the computer plug from the socket. I ask him why, and he doesn't give me a response. About thirty minutes later, he goes to my bathroom. 
He comes out, with it out again, and says, ""Please suck it."" 
I was revolted. I told him no the first time. 
I was so angry with him I made him leave at 11 at night. I didn't care about him hating me. The whole school hated him. Not because he was fat or black, because he was an asshole. Just an asshole. I was friends with him. He only wanted to become friends with me just for sex. 
EDIT: I was 13. I thought he was joking, the first time. Now I shiver every time thinking about it."	t5_2t3t8	True
1355717660.0	14z65c	Catching the morning bus	amberrgerr	230	44	27	"Sorry about the length, I tried to include all of the details that I can recall.

Context: I'm a girl. At the time I was 18, going to school in northern CA. I didn't have a car, so I had to catch two buses to get the 20 miles to my school. I took an 8am class, so I had to catch a 7am bus transfer to get there on time.

So there I am waiting at the BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) train station waiting for the bus I'm transferring onto to arrive. I'm just sitting on this concrete bench with my headphones on by myself on a cold winter morning. This guy walks by and starts pacing in front of my smoking a cigarette, but I just ignore him, figuring he's waiting for the same bus. He eventually sits next to me on the other end of the bench which I still just brush off as him waiting for the bus. He smells kinda bad, but he's a smoker and it's public transit.

Then this guy starts talking to me. Now, mind you, I'm still pretending to not be able to hear him until he taps my shoulder, scaring the living shit out of me. So I pause my music and take out a headphone to see what he wants, and oh man does shit get weird.

(Now, some of the specific details of the conversation I've forgotten since it's been 2 years, so bear with me here) He asks me what my name is. Lying, I tell him its something generic like Debbie. He starts talking about how he just got out of jail after being in for 3 months (he didn't say why) and told me that he saw my face in a Maxim magazine while he was in. Well fuck. All aboard the crazy train, because obviously there's no way in hell. He starts rambling about girls secretly wanting to be with bad guys and said that secretly deep down I wanted to be with him. ugh.

So a guy comes along who sees me clearly creeped the fuck out by this homeless looking guy, and engages him in a conversation to get his focus off me (holy mother of god I wanted to hug this stranger, I feel like he saved me from something unfortunate). So the bus finally shows up and I get my stuff together to board it and the creepy dude tells me I should catch the next one and stay to talk with him some more. LOLFUCKTHAT. ""Sorry, I have a class to get to"". So I sit across from the guy that saved me and thanked him profusely, at which he just said if he saw his girlfriend sitting there being creeped out like that he'd want someone to save her, too. THANK YOU KIND STRANGER &lt;3

1340844576.0	vprcy	The Old Man Upstairs	DazeLost	210	25	27	"I got a lot of good responses to that Liverpool story, so I figured I would add another.  Having had a lot of experiences and lived all over the world, I could probably fill this subreddit it up, but we'll just take it one at a time.

About three years ago, my parents purchased a bank-foreclosed property.  It was a 10,000 square foot mansion which they planned to renovate and either turn it in to an event hall or flip the house.  While construction was going on, though, we needed someone to stay at the house and watch over everything, so my girlfriend and I moved in.

While this was going on, I liked to tell her stories about how the mansion was actually a murder house - which was true, but only in the sense that the previous owner killed his wife somewhere else and then just bolted.  It sure creeped her out at night, though, and that made me laugh at the time.  Boyfriend of the year, ladies.

We did quickly discover that, while the house was foreclosed and abandoned, homeless people liked to use the pool in the back, sneak in through the window to use the built-in microwave, turn on the AC, or use the toilets.  For the most part, when we told them people owned this property, they agreed to stop coming.  Except one old man.

The first time we met him, he knocked on the pool-side door and a construction worker answered, who then (for some reason) pointed him to us.  The homeless man, who we'll call Dan, explained that he lived at the house and needed us all to get out.  I explained that he didn't and that I understood that homeless people came here while it was abandoned, we weren't going to allow that anymore.  

""No, no,"" he kept repeating.  ""It's mine, you have to get out now.""  I told him he had to leave, he responded by defecating in his pants.  Time to call the police, I thought.

The cops knew him by name, took him out, and I was left to clean up a streak of feces out the door and up the driveway.  I had hoped that was the end of it.

Two weeks later, we return from a daytrip to Six Flags, and Dan is pounding at the door.  He was screaming that his medicine was inside.  My girlfriend and I stayed in the car while she called the police again.  We were so focused on the call that neither of us noticed the wrench in his hand, which one of the construction workers must have left lying around.  He starts to come up to the car, I see the wrench, and I gun the ignition and go back up the circular parking lot with him chasing behind us.

God help me, part of me wanted him to follow us on to the road and get hit by a car.

When we returned with the police, Dan was gone, but the glass part of the rather expensive new door we ordered was smashed.  I sighed and dealt with it, as I would rather the door be smashed than my head.  The police said they would send a patrol car up every so often since the house was so close to the station, but there's not much else they can do besides check his usual haunts.  Fair enough, I guess, and the officers leave.

We go inside, do our usual business, and are laying in bed talking before going to sleep.  Talking soon turns to other things and pretty soon we're kissing to take our minds off things.  

The bedroom is set up so that there's a sitting area apart from the main bedroom area and it's separated by french doors made of glass.  So we didn't notice when the door to the sitting area from the hallway slowly opened.  We especially did not notice the person holding a small garden spade.  If not for me needing to hit the light to get something from inside the nightstand, we might never have heard someone drop the metal spade on the floor and go running out the door. 

We both slipped on clothes and ran outside outside the bedroom door to see someone basically rip the lock out of the front door and kick it open to get outside.  They took off like an animal, not even making a sound when running.

We called the police (who at this point seemed slightly tired of coming to this house) and checked around with an aluminum baseball bat in hand.  Our guess was that he simply ripped out one of the weaker door frames in a room with ongoing construction, we simply didn't notice it, and he hid in the attic until it got quiet.

They never did find him and we moved out shortly after.  We think he still shows up there occasionally, as speakers have been removed from walls, AC units have been stolen, and massive holes just show up in the walls sometimes.  I'm just glad I no longer live there."	t5_2t3t8	True
1340275533.0	vdk50	Had a stalker when I was in high school...	DarkPizza	202	19	40	"So, when I was a senior in high school (this would have been ~2007) I was out-of-the-blue contacted one day by this random guy on MySpace. I vaguely recognized him, but didn't know him. He told me that he knew me from school and that I had tutored him in math a couple of times. This should have been my first red flag that something was off: I hate math, and I've never tutored *anyone* in it. I told him he was mistaken, but I tried to be nice to him and we struck up a friendly conversation. 

Soon, the guy (Brian) started talking to me at school. It started off pretty innocently. He was giving me more attention than I wanted from him, but I was flattered and didn't think anything of it at the time. He was a couple of years younger than me and I figured he had developed a crush on me primarily because we were both kind of odd compared to the other kids in our high school. It was a very small school (my graduating class was about 40 people) and he and I were two of a very small number of ""alternative"" kids there. He was pretty emo, while I tended a bit more towards punk. Both of us loved My Chemical Romance. I figured he was just into me because there weren't many other girls with similar interests.

Before long, he started waiting for me at my locker. Every day, between every class. He started following me around before school and during lunch. He started coming to my performances (I was in drama and choir). I tried to be polite, but started avoiding him. I would go to the local grocery store to eat lunch, even though it was more expensive, because underclassmen weren't allowed to leave campus.

The situation continued to escalate to the point where he was sexually harassing me every chance I failed to avoid him. If he was waiting for me at my locker he would say sexually explicit things to me, tell me what he wanted to do to me, and tell me that when he was having sex with his girlfriend he wished she was me. At homecoming, he left his girlfriend waiting awkwardly while he came to tell me that he really wanted us all to have a threesome. Luckily my girlfriends were with me and came over as soon as they noticed him talking to me, which made him scurry away.

As quickly as it started, it was over. One day he stopped showing up at school. I was relieved, but curious. After about a month of him being gone, my friend mentioned him in front of my dad (who was also the principal of my high school). My dad questioned me about what happened and I ended up telling him the whole story. He seemed really troubled. I asked him what was wrong, and he told me why Brian had been absent from school recently.

Apparently not long after homecoming, Brian had strapped some fireworks to a cat and set them off. The cat exploded, and Brian laughed. He got caught and sent to kiddie jail, and was committed to a psychiatric facility by his parents after he was released. I don't know what happened to him after that. 

I'm thinking I dodged a bullet thought, because he turned out to be even crazier than I thought he was."	t5_2t3t8	True
1364733450.0	1bcstn	Tapping at the window...		240	55	32	"Back when I was 9 or 10 my family was extremely poor so naturally we lived in what would be considered a ""bad neighborhood."" It didn't help much that my bedroom was on the first floor and had a large window that was accessible to nearly anyone who could walk to the side of my house.

And of course there's always a damn tree at the window that would make scratching sounds and generally freak me out. I eventually got used to it until I watched the movie Signs. I was terrified of the scene where the little boy and his dad go upstairs and look out the window, to see one of the aliens just standing there, staring into his bedroom from the roof of the other building.

I was so paranoid of something like that happening. 

And one day, my fears came true. I was up late one night watching TV in my room. I was supposed to be in bed by 9pm, but ever since my parents allowed me to have a TV, I'd stay up late on school nights watching Adult Swim. Just after cutting to commercial break, I hear a tapping at the window. I was immediately terrified. It didn't sound like the normal sound of a tree branch against the glass, so I turned the TV volume down to see if I could hear it again.

The tapping sound again. Oh god. What to do. Tapping again, but a little louder. This time is sounded like knocking. Yes, there was definitely someone at the window. I didn't want to believe it was something scary... I thought for a second- maybe it was my neighbor? Maybe it was a friend who snuck out and wanted to visit? Maybe someone genuinely needed help?? I just wanted to find out as quickly as possible so the ""not knowing"" part wouldn't be so terrifying.

So I did pretty much the stupidest thing imaginable. Looking back on it now, I seriously cannot fathom what possesed me to do it. *I pulled back the curtain.*

WTF..... Dad?!? Yeah. My dad was standing there outside my window. Now with an angry look on his face. He makes an ""open the window"" motion with his arms. I crack open the window so I can hear him talk.

""Why did you open the curtain???"" He scolds. 

Me: ""Uh....""

Him: ""If someone knocks on your window, the first thing you do is go get me or your mother! It could be a bad person!!""

Me: ""Uh... okay. Sorry.""

Him: ""DO NOT do that again! I mean it!!"" 

Then he left, walked around the house and came back inside. I got another scolding later. But since I was stupid enough as a kid to actually open the curtain to someone who's knocking, I figure his method was pretty clever, and I consider it a lesson well learned.

**TL;DR- my father scares the shit out of 9-year-old me to teach me a lesson about answering knocks at my window.**

1347493367.0	zskti	"""She gave me a key."""	inblackheels	224	39	91	"This all began about a two -- nearly three years ago. I am a 23 year old female, and I spend too much time on the internet (mostly) playing video games - I learned this the hard way.


I was living with a friend of mine, and finally getting away from my dysfunctional family for the first time in my life - I finally wrapped cosmetology school and was working for a makeup company as a freelance artist, and the only thing I brought with me from home was my dog Capone. To help pass the time in between weddings or proms, I started playing an online game. I always loved games, normally playstation games... but the social experience to MMOs was something new, and before long I started making friends and adding them to my facebook page. Talking to people online was nice; it was somewhat unbinding from the constraints of social pretense, and I felt like I could just speak my mind and be honest and open with people; in turn they were the same toward me. I liked it.


I've always been really trusting or maybe just borderline naive. I found myself becoming ever-increasingly addicted to the lifestyle. My closest guild-mates would always comment how ""it was so weird to have a hot gamer girl on the internet"" and how ""down to earth"" I was stuff like that, which I just brushed off as compliments, but it would soon become clear that one of the flatterers was becoming increasingly obsessed with me. 


We were a relatively small and close-knit guild of about 30 people. I had become a mini-officer so I helped run events in the game and recruit people. I had a ""clique"" of about 4 people I played with consistently without fail when I had the time. I found myself spending the longest duration with Eric, someone who hailed from NYC. We'd always hang out, and eventually when the hours got too late for some people he'd always be around. He claimed to be working for Fed Ex, but somehow he'd always manage to be around whenever my hours were available. 


On Facebook, he'd write me asking where I was when I was absent for a few days but I figured it was just a friend's curiosity more than anything else. As time began to pass onward, in one of our guild meetings I let my guild leader know I'd be gone for about two weeks as I was moving from CA to the midwest on a whim.


On youtube, I had made a video that I posted on facebook (I figured it was more personable than posting a giant message) letting my friends know where I was headed, and stupidly I dropped the city name. It was a small town and I'd never heard of it before, I literally had picked the state out of a hat and found the cheapest location I could; I wanted a fresh start. Everyone wished me luck and I packed up my things and road tripped to my new and far away location.


After being there for about almost two weeks; unpacking my belongings and getting settled in, taking a step down from the gaming world at least for a while until I got a steady income flowing again. I didn't have internet yet, money was tight and I was out everyday applying at different cosmetic companies. I had recently had a slew of interviews  the past couple of days, and I was super drained. I got maybe three hours of sleep and had another interview in the early morning.


It was about 5:00AM when I heard an odd scratching sound emanating from the living room of my house, followed by the low growl of my dog, Capone. I got up out of bed and inched toward the noise, and that's when I heard it. I'll never forget the sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach when I realized that sound was coming from a human being... There was a man outside of my apartment, and he began barking at my dog. 


I immediately grabbed my cell phone and called 911. They placed me on HOLD, in a small town. I was flipping out. I looked out the sliding glass door and the man was still there, trying to force open the door, by the look of it he had unscrewed and fiddled with the lock somehow and if I hadn't of had a bar in the damn thing he would of gotten in. He had a few of his fingers inside of my house, and I ran over and slammed the door onto his hand as hard as I could. He laughed at me; I couldn't see his face; he had on a black turtleneck that was pulled over his mouth, but I saw light strawberry blonde hair that was buzzed sticking out and his eyes - one blue and one brown. That's when it clicked in my head.


Eric had heterochromia; a trait I thought was unique, and he also had strawberry blonde hair. I knew it was him.


I didn't have a gun or anything, but I grabbed the biggest knife I could find and held onto Capone. Like straight out of a movie; FINALLY the police actually come to the phone, and ask me my emergency. I tell them someone tried to break in, and to come immediately. They asked me to stay on the line, but I remember being distraught and setting the phone down. I looked through the parking lot outside and saw Eric sitting in a rental car, casually in the parking lot.


It took about 10 minutes for the police to get there. When they arrived, I was more composed and tried explaining the situation. I told them that I had seen him still sitting in the parking lot and I didn't know if he was still there. They ended up looking and found him parked there sleeping. I waited inside my apartment with one of the officers while they talked to him in the hallway of the building. I overheard some of the conversation.


Officer: This young woman says you tried to break into her apartment.

Eric: She's my girlfriend, she's making a mistake.

Officer: How exactly do you know her?

Eric: I had planned to come see her for over three weeks, she knew about it, she gave me a key. I tried breaking in when she didn't answer, I thought she was hurt.


I got so mad that I drowned out the rest of the conversation; but when the Officer from the hall came in he actually had bought the creeps story! I blatantly pointed at the sliding door and shown where he had tampered with it, the Officer was questioning me and gave me a body check, looking at me like I was some sort of a whore for wearing what I was in my own freakin' place.. It was awful.


The cops ended up ordering him to stay away from me, but they rolled their eyes and made me feel like I did something wrong. Not to mention they questioned me LONGER than they did him because I had an out of state ID. They made him leave the premises in the end, and left. I felt unsafe, awful, scared... I didn't go back to sleep and I ended up missing my interview. The next day later on I was getting the mail and ended up telling what happened to a neighbor of mine who happened to be an ex-marine, that made me feel a little safer. Needless to say, I never went back with my guild and I deleted everyone from it off of my facebook.


I wish I could say it ended there... but it didn't. 


Fast forward 3 months. I am getting ready to leave for work and backing out when someone comes and stands behind my car. It was Eric. I didn't know what to do, I screamed. He hit the trunk of my car with his fists. I am a small girl, 125 pounds and 5 foot 8, but he was shorter than me and I was NOT going to be bullied. I got out of the car and screamed ""GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME!"" 


I ran inside the apartment building and he was right behind me, I was holding the door to the building with my hands and he was able to pull it open and run toward me, he grabbed my hair arm and pulled on me but I stepped on his foot as hard as I could with my heels and he grunted in pain and released his grip on me long enough for me to get into my apartment. I locked and chained the door and called the cops, this time they came fast.


When they got there, he was gone. 


A few months after that, I saw him in Nordstrom while I was at work, he just locked eyes with me and smiled at me. I had to tell my boss what happened. 


I WISH this was the end of it, but it wasn't.  In March this year , guess what? The lunatic psycho was IN MY PARKING LOT SLEEPING IN A RENTAL CAR!  AGAIN! and he stayed for three weeks this time. One day he even had texted me there was a ""present on my porch"" and it was him standing there as well, before returning to his car.


I had to call the cops and report it again. I filled out a restraining order. I have no idea where he is now or what he's doing but I don't think that he's done with me, I have this horrible feeling. I'm scared everyday.  I finally have a gun license. The thing that bothers me the most is that he lives in New York, and actually flies out here half way across the states just to do this to me. I really hope that it's over, but based on how obsessed he's been I think it's far from it.

1341442760.0	w1vmt	Later he shot his grandmother in the head.	pv22	214	31	38	"First time ever posting on reddit, bear with me. (Long time lurker blah blah)
I grew up in Michigan, typical childhood stuff, getting into trouble with my brother and our friends. My brother and I shared a mutual friend when we were in grade school named Brandon. He seemed like a normal boy when we first met, though his grandmother and mother were fairly abusive towards him openly.. Calling him a fuck-up and a retard in front of friends.
As we aged Brandon and my brother fell into drug use as most typical hooligan kids do (nothing tooo special to note, pot, pills, the norm) and of course the abuse towards Brandon had gotten worse and he often talked of how much he hated his parents/grandmother as they were always calling the police on him for being high/drunk and generally being a hooligan as a kid. As we entered high school I personally had lost touch with Brandon although my brother hung out with him fairly regularly and as time passed Brandon would comment more and more about how his Grandma was a bitch and the like. One time while talking to him and my brother, Brandon said ""I wish my grandma would just disappear, the giant cunt would stop being so mean to me then"".
Further on down our high school years, my brother had mostly lost contact with him and I had been completely out of the friendship for a couple of years having no contact whatsoever with him. My brother comes home from hanging out with Brandon one random night and says something to the effect of ""wow that kid really hates his grandma""
About a month later, as my brother and I are hanging out we hear from a friend that Brandon had walked into his house, shot his grandmother in the head and then waited for his mother to come home and shot her multiple times as well. He then called a couple of friends and said that he'd finally killed the bitch, and when she was dead threw the phone at her screaming ""call the police now bitch!"" The people he'd called to brag, called the local police and the police went and arrested him.

1338319398.0	uarui	Good Thing I Don't Like Sausage with My Pizza	lazyslug	227	41	28	"I attend a college that is located in one of the poorest cities in Northern California. The campus is relatively safe since the school employs its own department of public safety, but after the sun sets its usually a good call to remain indoors because that's when the townies come out and they tend to wander onto campus.

About 2 years ago, I was living in an apartment complex on the main part of campus and I still didn't have a car yet. It was the end of the Fall semester and I was the last person in my apartment of 3 girls to finish taking finals so I was home alone since my roommates had already gone home for winter break. I got back from taking my last exam and followed my usual routine of dejectedly collapsing into bed to cry/sleep off the effects of pulling an all-nighter. When I finally woke up, it was already past 10PM and I was starving. Unfortunately, the student grocery store and cafeteria were closed for day and I had nothing in the apartment to eat and no car to get food elsewhere. I was woefully poking around the fridge in the hopes that I would find something substantial to tide me over until morning when I noticed a Domino's coupon that someone had stuck to the freezer. My stomach's pathetic cries for sustenance had been answered! I quickly decided that there was no shame in ordering a whole pizza (+ cinna stix) for myself because 1) I was ravenous, 2) the completion of finals demanded some sort of celebration, and 3) if anyone happened to ask I was going to lie and say I was sharing with a friend or something along those lines. Anyway, I eagerly order up my feast for 1 and provide the cashier with my address, apartment, and cell number. I typically never give out my number to anyone, but I had ordered delivery from Domino's in the past, and I knew that they needed my number to call me once they were outside because the drivers always got lost navigating through campus.

About 20 minutes later, I got the call--my food was here! For reference, it was now close to midnight and the campus was pretty much dead since most students had gone home. The driver told me he was parked in front of a dorm building that was right across the street from my apartment. I hustled out of my apartment and was going down the stairs when I spotted the delivery guy waiting outside of his car with my pizza. At this point, my sense of caution kicked in and I slowed my pace as my brain took in the fact that there were no other students out, the lighting was bad, and I was essentially walking up to a stranger and his car that still had its engine running. As I neared the bottom of the steps, I silently hoped that he would cross the street and approach me so that I wouldn't have to get near the car. Of course, that didn't happen.

I made my way across the street and was finally able to get a good look at him. He was a relatively short hispanic guy, maybe 5'7""-5'9"", in his early twenties, and my nerves were getting bombarded by the creeper vibes he was giving off. (I can only compare it to the vibe that you get when you're out clubbing and you suddenly spot the guy lurking in the crowd sporting the slicked-back ponytail, sunglasses, over-sized shirt, and sagged pants combo who just so happens to be headed in your direction.) I did my best to appear calm and keep the mood light and friendly. He made some comments about how late it was and how no one was around but I just signed the receipt as quickly as possible, gave him my thanks and an awkward smile, and hightailed it out of there as soon as he handed me my food. I could feel him watching me as I climbed the stairs back to my place.

Once I got back into my apartment, I locked and chained up the door, and sat down on the living room couch to calm myself. After a few moments, I shrugged off the situation and reasoned that it was just my paranoia and overactive imagination acting up again. I had just turned on the T.V. and was about to take my first bite of pizza when I got a text from an unknown number. It read:

""Ur hella sexy [pHiLdO]""

I connected the dots and matched the text number to the call that I had received earlier from the pizza delivery guy. My initial reaction of course was shock since nothing like this had ever happened to me before, but that eventually melted away into laughter and disbelief when I considered my appearance at the time. Like I had mentioned earlier, I had JUST woken up from my nap after taking the last of my finals. I was wearing a pair of raggedy sweatpants and a loose sweatshirt, my hair was nappy and tied up in a messy ponytail, my face was probably greasier than the pizza I was eating, and to top it off I had my glasses on-- definitely not a pretty picture, much less anything that could even come close to resembling ""hella sexy"".

The next morning I got a call from my boyfriend, John, and I casually told him about Phildo and the events that had transpired the previous evening. After sheepishly trying to defend my actions on the basis of poor judgement caused by extreme hunger and promising never to do that type of thing again, John convinced me that I should report it to the campus police as a precautionary measure. I gave them a call and an officer stopped by my apartment a few hours later. I relayed my story, he took some pictures of the text message, and he wrote down Phildo's phone number. The officer then told me that he could contact the Domino's if I wanted him to, but that it would most likely result in Phildo's termination. I was still relatively unphased by the whole situation and I told the officer that I just wanted to make sure that this creep never did this to any other girls on campus, but at the same time I didn't want him to lose his job. The officer then started asking me questions about how I felt after my encounter. Questions along the lines of -- Do you feel threatened by Phildo? Do you feel safe in your apartment with the knowledge that Phildo has both your phone number and your exact address? If I wasn't scared before, I definitely was now and during the course of my ""questioning,"" I had broken out in a cold sweat and my traitorous imagination began conjuring up all sorts of dastardly situations that ended in my untimely demise. Obviously, I ended up giving the officer the go-ahead to pursue my case and contact the Domino's.

About a month later, while I was at home celebrating the holidays, I got a call from my boyfriend. I had left him the keys to my apartment so that he could store his bike there and crash in my room while I was away. He told me that he had stopped by my place, but that he couldn't get in because the keys weren't working. He also said that it looked like someone had broken in because there was some glass on the floor and a wooden board across my living room window. I was pretty upset because this was my first time hearing about it, so I called the school the next day to figure out what the hell had happened. Housing transferred my call to the public safety department and the officer I spoke with was only able to tell me that, according to their records, a maintenance worker had called them two days after I had headed home to report my broken window. Public safety had responded by boarding up the window and changing the lock when they noticed it had been tampered with. I convinced the officer to let my boyfriend into my apartment so he could check if anything was stolen, and thankfully, nothing was.

My gut tells me that it was Phildo who did it. It was Phildo who tried to pick my lock and then broke my window. It scares me even more now when I consider the fact that nothing had been stolen. My flat screen TV was right by the window that had been broken and my boyfriend's fancy road bike was sitting right there in the living room. Why didn't he steal anything? Does that mean his intentions were to break in and get his revenge on me, the girl that had cost him his job? Would this still have happened if I had not given the officer permission to pursue the case? I try not to spend too much time speculating about what Phildo's true intentions were, but when I do, it still makes my heart race when I think about what could have happened if I had still been in my apartment at the time. 

EDIT: Just to clarify, I don't know for sure who broke into my apartment that day. I've just always had this feeling that it was the delivery man aka ""Phildo"" based on the circumstances at the time. Also, thank you everyone for reading my first-ever reddit post! "	t5_2t3t8	True
1362692156.0	19vbxb	Pedophile coach and a very smart younger me	Vargetta	215	35	20	"Back in middle school I used to play basketball in the city league like a lot of young kids do and I had a lot of fun over the years getting to play on the same teams with my friends. I had this one main coach who I played under for a few years on different teams and he in turn had an assistant coach named Cam that would help out at practices and games. 

Cam was a nice guy who was was a lot of fun to goof around with at practice because he had a kid-like personality (always making jokes, teasing people, etc.). However, there was always something a little bit off about him and the smart middle school-aged me recognized this. For one thing, he was a guy who was probably in his mid-30s coaching 11, 12, and 13 year olds but who didn't have any kids of his own on the team. He was also overweight and would always wear white t shirts with really bad yellow pit stains to practices and games. I don't know why, but this really creeped me out. However, both of these things weren't completely out of the ordinary and he was good friends with the main coach and other players' parents, so they didn't bother me for too long at the time.

During one particular season (I believe I was in 6th grade), I was on a team with my best friend who was more aggressive than I was on the court and who would always score more points than me. Before one of our last games, Cam told me that if I scored the most points in the game, he would give me 10,000 sports cards (mainly baseball, but they also included basketball and football). At the time, I was really into collecting cards so I jumped at the offer and during the next game I scored the most points with the help of my teammates. True to his word, at our next practice Cam had 10,000 sports cards in two large white boxes that he gave me. I realize that this sounds kind of far-fetched, as 10,000 is a lot of cards (I actually didn't believe he would really give them to me), but he did actually end up giving them to me and I still have them.

Anyway, that season ended and I went on a hiatus from basketball for a while to focus on soccer and baseball (at least that's what I told my parents. It was really because I couldn't shake the feeling that Cam was a creepy guy and I wanted to get away from him). Eventually I forgot all about him though and went back to basketball 2 seasons later. A few years later, my parents sat me down in our kitchen and had a newspaper article on the table which they told me to read. It turns out that Cam was a major pedophile and was convicted and sentenced to 45 years to life for molesting 3 boys and for possession of large amounts of child pornography. Apparently he would lure the boys to his house by buying/giving them things and befriending their families. Thankfully he never did anything to me, but looking back at the 10,000 cards he gave me and the fact that the timeline of when he did these things lined up with when I was on his team, it seems that he was possibly ""grooming"" me as a potential victim. That article scared the shit out of me the more I thought about what could have happened, and I am so glad that younger me was smart enough to get away from him before anything did. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1343873166.0	xjh79	The Saw	pharma15	226	43	45	"Like most other first-time contributors I found this subreddit a few days ago and have been peeled to it. Some **amazing** stories and talented storytellers in here! I have only one relevant experience from my life that I consider a decent fit for this subforum.. and whilst it's not on the same level as some of the great posts in here I feel the need to contribute it anyway. The memory of this experience had completely slipped from my mind - for years I hadn't thought about it until one of the other stories triggered the memory and sent shivers down my spine. I don't recall the details as vividly as I used to but I will do my best.

I tried to keep this story short but it turned out longer than I expected. People complain no matter what, so if you don't like long stories I'm going to advise you to just stop reading now. No hard feelings, it just irks me when people complain in the comments or down vote because a voluntary reading was too long for their liking. :-)

I grew up in an affluent suburb on the East Coast of the USA for most of my childhood years. It is a beautiful town with fields, mansions, celebrities, and more snotty rich kids than you would care to ever meet. It was pretty safe, most of the crime was people from other cities burglarizing the town because it was wealthy (poorer areas were only a short drive away). Our house wound up getting robbed a few years later by 4 people while I was the only one home, which is a different story for a another day. Anyways back to it - I lived in an older, more modest part of town, still very nice but not as extravagant as most of the other developing communities. Most of the houses in my community were upwards of 50 years old and therefore *just starting* to dance around the criteria needed to consider them creepy old houses.

This takes place in the 90s - I was 11 years old at the time. I'm a male. Next to my house lived an awesome retired couple who liked to travel a lot. While they were gone I would go over their house once a day to check the house and take care of their fairly antisocial cat. I would always try to give him attention since I love animals and I knew he was alone but most days he would run away from me. Sometimes I would catch him in a good mood and he would want to run around, play with some toys, or hang out on the couch and let me pet him.

On the particular day in question the cat (his name escapes me) was feeling social. We played around for a few minutes and eventually it led to me chasing him around the house. The cat ran down to the finished basement, where his litter box and toys were, but when I got down there I didn't see him in any of his usual spots. This was weird to me because he had his litter box and ""cat tree"" in the corner of the room and usually he would go right to them. The basement was pretty empty and therefore lacking good hiding places. I glanced around quick - under the couch, behind the TV - until the open workshop door caught my eye. Ah hah! Got him.

The workshop was situated so the door wasn't readily visible from the main area of the basement. I had been in there before so I hurried in and flipped the light switch on. As soon as light flooded the room, my eyes found the cat and he was already on the move, darting past me and flying up the stairs. Sigh. The game starts to lose its appeal when your opponent is small, quiet, and fast.

I remember this part of the story like it was yesterday. The moment I turned the light switch on, my eyes found the cat, who was already running and passing me on my left. My eyes followed the cat as he ran and therefore my body made a counterclockwise turn to face the main basement and watched him run up the stairs. I stood there for a moment in silence, just barely inside the workshop doorway, straining to hear him to try to figure out which direction he was running on the floor above me. Then I heard it.

An electric saw turned on behind me.

Out of nowhere. In this empty house occupied by only me and the cat.

I BOLTED. Out of the workshop, up the stairs, and directly up to the second floor. I ran into a bedroom and locked the door behind me. My 11 year old heart must have been going 200 mph. I was freaking out. I had no idea what to do. There was no phone in the room and this was before cell phones. I laid on the ground trying to listen for any movement on the floor beneath me and heard nothing. I didn't hear the saw anymore. Just a still, eerie silence.

Some time passed, probably a few minutes, and I decided I couldn't stay in that room forever. I quietly opened the door and looked around. Confident that the coast looked pretty clear, I walked over to the master bedroom intent on calling my Dad to come get me. My Father (rest his soul) was an extremely intimidating man. Growing up with no parents in a bad area molded him into somewhat of a roughneck so just the thought of him entering the house alleviated all my concerns and suddenly I wasn't freaked out anymore. My Dad would come get me. If there was anyone in the house, my Dad would deal with them. I had nothing to be afraid of.

I sat at the head of the bed where the phone was. This part of the memory is foggy, but for some reason another object on the nightstand really caught my interest before I could make the phone call - an erotic novel. Lol. I didn't know about the concept of erotic novels at the time, but it had sex in the title and when you're 11 that's MORE than enough to pique your interest. I grab the book and start browsing through it but eventually got bored when I realized there were no pictures.

I put the book back. It took a moment for the ""I might see boobs"" preoccupation to wear off my brain, and when it did, I remembered why I was in this room in the first place. My alert level heightened a bit but I was starting to feel silly. Maybe I was overreacting and there was a good reason why the saw came on. Maybe I was losing my mind at a young age and there had been no saw in the first place. I hadn't even closed the master bedroom door while I was sitting on the bed looking at a stupid erotic novel. Regardless I resigned to call my Dad anyway. When I picked up the phone my stomach dropped - the line was dead.

My alert level went back to freak-out mode and I decided to just leave. I started walking towards the open bedroom door and froze when I saw something. For visual purposes let me explain the setup. Their second floor stairway was open. It had two sets of stairs - a small set of 4 or 5 steps, then a landing where you turned and walked up the rest of the steps. Pretty standard. There was a banister overlooking the foyer and stairs. I really think I saw a head of black hair at the ground level of the second floor, right under the banister. As if someone was standing still on the landing of the stairs. At the time I swore up and down that I saw this hair. However, looking back I now admit that could have been my mind playing tricks on me. That's besides the point though.

Ok so freak-out mode is back in gear. I slammed the door, locked it, and started yelling at whatever I saw in the house to get out and go away. Probably not the best move in that situation but give me a break, I was 11. Then I saw it. One side of the master bedroom had a window facing my house. I opened the window and started yelling towards my house for attention. We had trees in between our houses but it didn't take long for my Mom to come running through the tree line asking me what was wrong. I didn't explain everything I just told her to go get my Father because I thought someone was in the house. She ran back and within a minute my Dad walked through the trees. I *finally* got to breathe a sigh of relief. I told him the code for the garage and he came in, got me from upstairs, and then we checked the whole house together.

We found no one. All of the doors were locked and there were no signs of forced entry anywhere. The cat was in his cat tree/cat house in the basement. The workshop light was still on and there was both a mitre box and circular saw sitting on a workbench plugged in. Both could have made the sound but they were both turned off. Weird.

The line was dead because the phone in the kitchen was off the hook. It was a corded phone with a receiver hung on the wall and the actual phone sitting on the kitchen table. This freaked me out. However, since there was no explanation for it, my Dad just calmed me down and told me I probably did it and forgot, tying it into some joke about me always being on the phone (I had just gotten my own line). Their kitchen had an inset ""dining area"" for the kitchen table, so three sides of the table are surrounded by wall and one side faces the kitchen. If you were facing the table, the cat's bowls were on the left side and the phone was on the right side.

I was still freaked out but I just laughed it off and quickly finished my cat chores. I went downstairs and cleaned out the litter box, filled the cats water, topped off his food, and cleaned up food that had spilled around the kitchen table. Imagination or not, I was done with that house for the day so we walked back home.

Now if that was all there was to my story, I would not be posting it. I would have chalked it up to my imagination and being 11 years old. However it wasn't until an hour or two after I got home that my confused mind was replaying the whole event in my head and I came to my ""NOPE"" moment.

Earlier when I was chasing the cat, before he went down the basement I had chased him around the kitchen table. I kicked his food bowl by accident which is why there was spilled food on the kitchen floor that I had to clean up. If that kitchen phone had been off the receiver and sitting on the kitchen table like we found it, I wouldn't have been able to chase the cat around the table. I would have run into the cord and had to put it back on the receiver. If I had knocked it over while I was running, I would have heard it. Even if I didn't hear it, it would have landed on the ground, not neatly on the table.

Someone else was in the house that day and they took the phone off the hook.

I never found out who it was, never told my neighbors the story, and never again watched their house when they went on vacation."	t5_2t3t8	True
1341799232.0	w8yjf	They followed me...straight to the police station	lnh92	213	29	29	"I was once driving home from a friends house. It was about midnight, maybe 12:30. I noticed this car following me, and I didn't really freak out about it when I went to cut through a neighborhood, like I usually do, and they did the same thing. Now, I cut through this neighborhood because I like the long winding road, and because someone once got attacked on the road that is the shorter way. 

So when this car follows me, I think they must live in this neighborhood, but they cut through it like I do. So now I'm starting to freak out, but trying to rationalize it, maybe they live in one of the neighborhoods I'm going to drive by. But no such luck. I drive the rest of the way to my neighborhood with them following me past like 4 or 5 other neighborhoods, and through about 7 intersections. 

So I decide that I'm sure as hell not going to go to my house, so I drive past my neighborhood. They keep following me. So I'm thinking ""Shit! What am I gonna do?"" Then I remember my local police station. So I drive there, with this car still following me. I turn onto the little road leading to the police station, and the car is still following me. I parked directly in front of the doors and locked eyes with the guy on duty through the doors. He starts walking out. I wasn't paying attention to the other car anymore, but the officer said it left. 

I told the guy what happened. He got one officer on duty to try to find the car. Nothing came of it. He got another officer to follow me home. 

Scared the shit outta me. But now I know to always go straight to the police station."	t5_2t3t8	True

So my first post on this subreddit is a bit of a twist on the usual stories I see here. I was looking around Barnes and Noble for a study guide to begin preparing for my GRE's. I was looking around where they typically would be, but the format of the store changes from time to time. I ended up in the sexuality section where I see this girl. Cute, but couldn't have been older than 15 years old reading the Kama Sutra. She notices me staring at her out of curiosity, then goes back to her book. I was about to leave when I noticed a book on tantric sex right next to her. Now, I have heard about it, but I figured I'd take a look. blah blah blah, spice up the bedroom, blah blah blah, things you don't need to hear about. I move in to close proximity of this girl to grab my book, start flipping through, then feel that she is staring at me. I look over and smile, so she promptly puts her book away and leaves in a hurry. I start flipping through and decide... I'm gonna buy this. I take it, then find my GRE book. I'm heading towards the cashier when I notice her again, sitting on a couch out side of the built in starbucks reading something new. I stop to take a look at what book she has now, thinking it was another sketchy book not appropriate for her age. Now... My glasses are kind of outdated, so I realize (now) that I was leering at her. She looks up to see me. I smile, still squinting to see what was on the cover in her lap. She sees the book on tantric sex in my arm, then shifts around in her chair in discomfort. The line starts to move, so I pay for my shit and then leave. On my way out, I see her once again outside, possibly waiting for her ride to come get her. My windows were down, and I was at a stop sign. She was literally 10 feet away from my window, and I stare at her. I suddenly burst out in a laugh realizing how uncomfortable the situation was, gave one last friendly smile, then drove off to get home to... study.

So I slept on this issue for a day before realizing how creeptastic I was. Welp... thought I'd share with everyone on this sub before I forget.

P.S. The twist is that I'd rather not meet this girl again out of embarrassment and awkwardness.

Back in the 1990s, when I was in high school, I convinced my parents to get AOL (America Online). I remember my mother being worried that all I would be exposed to was ""that thing called porn."" She didn't really understand what the internet was, and it wasn't until I told her I needed it for school that she relented. 

I took the internet right away. I was really into a certain video game character at the time, so I would spend hours looking stuff up about the game, and after days of browsing, was surprised to discover that there was no site specifically designated to them. I decided to learn some html and in a couple of days, had coded a crude ""Shrine to _____."" Even though it was mostly a stack of &lt;img&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;img&lt;hr&gt;&lt;img&gt; tags, I'm proud to say it was one of the first of its kind. 

Through my site, I met a lot of people who also had the same interests from around the world, a girl from California, a dude from Texas, and Guy, an 18yr old from Europe. Some set up their own websites, and before long we had a little webring going on. We would chat pretty much everyday, and Guy even mailed me an awesome book that was only available in Europe at the time. I still have it. At one point, Guy bought a microphone and we sort of audio-chatted, him talking, while I IMed him back in text. 

A year or so later, Guy's brother died in a tragic accident, and soon after his girlfriend broke up with him. He was pretty distraught. One day, I logged onto AOL to find an email from Guy waiting in my inbox. In it, he declared that he was in love with me. 

Needless to say, I was pretty taken aback. Guy had never seen a picture of me, or even heard my voice. We had never met, or even talked about anything remotely romantic. How could he be in love with me? Being the shy teenager that I was, I immediately cut off all contact with him.

He didn't really take too kindly to that. He started IMing me any time I was online, asking me where I had been, what I did that day, and why wasn't I answering him? Back then, IM was a pretty new thing, so the privacy options weren't what they are today. The only thing I could do at that point was minimize his IM window. If I blocked his name, he would just make a new one.  Anytime I checked his IM box, he would just be there, chatting to himself, about how much he loved me, how he was going to find out where I lived, how he was going to fly to my city and find me, how happy we were going to be together.

The thing is, I was terrified that he actually WOULD come to my house. I had stupidly given him my home address years before so he could mail me something. What if he showed up at my door? I didn't have the gall to tell my mother, who barely understood the internet, that I had inadvertently become the target of a stalker who lived in Europe. Would she even believe me? What could she do with that information anyway? Go to the police? What could they do? The internet was still so new, and laws against cyber stalking weren’t even a blip on the legal horizon.

My fears were (somewhat) relieved when one day, in his rants, Guy tried to bait me into telling him what my mailing address was again. He said he had ""lost it"" and had something new that he wanted to send me. He said that he was sure I would like it. I, of course, didn't respond. It was very fortunate that he lost my address, because for my family’s financial reasons, moving was out of the question.

He found out my sister's screenname too. My sister, who was only 10 at the time, would get IMs from him, trying to get her to give out information about me and our family, asking what I was up to, and where I was that day. That really pissed me off, being that she was just a little kid, but again, I had no idea what I could actually DO about it, besides tell him off.

I graduated from high school, and moved into a dorm at college. My boyfriend at the time set up a personal website about himself, I think as a class project. There was a picture of me on that site; a picture taken on my birthday. Soon after that site went live, Guy's starting IMing about how he saw my boyfriend's website, and how he finally saw what I looked like, and now that he knows what college I went to, he could find me. The picture went down immediately. I know, looking back, it seems like such a duh thing, putting your picture up on the internet when you know you have a stalker, but back then the thought of him being able to find me like that just never occurred to any of us. My name is pretty common, so it's not like he could have just searched for it. I still don’t know how he tracked down that site.

By now, it had been years of this, and Guy's messages had become more violent. He would write about how he was saving up money to come to the US and kill me. Find my family, find my boyfriend. I’m not sure if he wrote what he did to try to shock a reaction from me, but they were unnerving. My boyfriend begged me to change my screenname, but to me, that just seemed like giving in. I was really attached to my screenname; I was one of the lucky few who had one that didn't require numbers at the end. I didn't want to start my cyber life over on account of one jerk who lived overseas. He had been threatening for years to come and find me, and never did. At this point, he was a small annoyance in my life. I figured he was just all talk. 

I eventually did change my screenname, in junior year of college, but it wasn't on account of Guy. I did it because I thought up a new screenname that I thought suited me better, and I also had felt like I had outgrown the previous one. After I changed my screenname, the IMs from Guy stopped. 

Years later, while trying to recall an old friend's screenname, I signed onto my old account. Lo and behold, guess who I get an IM from. Guy. He apologized for his past behavior, saying that he had been in a ""dark place"" in his life, and for some reason fixated on me to deal with it. He told me he had a live-in girlfriend now, and even though I was happy that he was in a better place, I made sure to keep the conversation polite but brief, being careful not to reveal too much personal information. That was the last I heard from him. 

Today, I make sure that any company I work for doesn't list my full name or picture on their website. Any online presence I have is set to private. My usernames are never the same. My chat privacy is set so that I have to add your name before I show up on your buddy list. Growing up with someone like Guy tracing you online made me very aware of how much of a cyber footprint I have. You can never be too careful.

Tl;DR - knew a guy only online who suddenly says he's in love with me. cyber stalks me throughout high school and college. years later, apologizes.

1370640325.0	1fw0mg	Why I have a rational fear of all utility workers now.		222	37	39	"I'll have to preface this whole encounter with some information. At the time this story took place, I lived in the suburbs right outside a big city. To go downtown, it took upwards of 30 minutes from my house and even though I was an adult at this point (19, to be exact), my parents were never crazy about me going downtown. They always told me horror stories about *""creeps and weirdos""*, but I always thought they were tall tales to keep me in line. 



Until I met one. 



On the night this happened, I'd asked my parents to let me go downtown with my best friend and watch some friends skate. They said no. I begged and of course my best friend chimed in about how we'd *""be together and would watch out for one another""*, so finally they reluctantly agreed. The BFF went to go pick up her boyfriend first (I didn't have enough gas), so we ended up meeting one another there. 




I honestly don't know when he began watching us, but I strongly suspect it began downtown. I think he watched me and my friend while we was sat in our skimpy little tank tops and shorts and probably got a big kick out of us being flirty and raunchy with our guy friends. Anyway, at around 10, I told my BFF I needed to jet. While she didn't have a curfew (like most kids my age), my parents still ruled me with an iron fist. I had one of those as-long-as-you-live-in-my-house kind of Dads. 



So me and my BFF get to our cars and head back to my house since she was going to spend the night. We also knew my mom and dad were going out so we could probably sneak some of my mother's vodka and replace the stolen hooch with water (a move we thought was sheer genius back then). When we got on the interstate, I noticed a guy in a white utility truck behind me (my BFF was in front because she knew the way better). I wasn't suspicious or anything at that point. It was just a simple observation. 



I started to become suspicious when he'd been behind us for about 20 minutes. Why was he heading out of the city? He was in a work truck and I never saw those trucks where I lived in the suburbs. My BFF always took the back roads to my place and ultimately, that probably saved us because it really alerted me that something was wrong. 



She turned down the first back road and he turned, too. She turned down the second back road and he turned, too. We finally turn onto my street and he turns, too. At this point, I'm starting to flip out because I have a horrible feeling in my gut. Everything inside my head is screaming *""JUST RUN! RUN INSIDE!""* This was before the days of cell phones, too. I couldn't call 911 or even warn my friend. I couldn't do anything except flash my brights at my best friend and hope she got the hint. 



But she didn't. 



She thought I was joking and started dramatically swerving in her car in response. I started honking while I flashed my lights and tried to mouth *""KEEP DRIVING!""* to her as she looked back. Nothing. She just swerved and honked back while she made crazy gestures at me in her rear view mirror. The problem is, I'd just started driving and my parents never talked about the possibility of anything like this happening and I didn't know what to do. I didn't want to keep going in my car and run the risk of her stopping (thinking I was going to the store) and having the guy get out and hurt her. If I were in front I would have let him follow us to the police station, but I wasn't. So when she pulled up to the curb at my house, I already had my seat belt off. I jumped out and screamed, 



*""RUN! SOMEONE HAS BEEN FOLLOWING US SINCE DOWNTOWN. I'M SERIOUS, RUN! NOW!""*



At first she looked confused because he'd dropped back a bit, but sure enough, he drove up. The cab of his truck was dark, but you could tell he was wearing a cap. All we could see was this tan arm hanging out of his window give us a casual wave as if to say, *""I'll be raping and murdering you both tonight,""* and I imagined that behind the shadow where his face should be was a big ole smile.




WE TOOK OFF. 



As soon as the door closed I made sure every deadbolt was engaged and every chain was on. Feet moving as fast as my heart was beating, I began checking the house for any points of entry I was overlooking. My BFF started crying. 




She says, *""Should we call 911? Let's call 911.""* 



*""You know if I call the police and tell them this guy followed us from downtown my parents won't ever let me do anything with you again.""*



After about an hour of constant patrols around the house and peeking outside the front window, our hearts weren't beating in our throats anymore. We decided to go look outside. Shaken up from the night's events, we'd made ourselves stout screwdrivers and were starting to relax a little from the warmth of the liquor in our bellies. We went out on my driveway and I smoked a cigarette. With the realization we were finally alone again, we actually started to laugh a little bit at ourselves. I go to put my smoke out in the ashtray on our porch when I stop dead in my tracks. 



Three houses down, sitting in a neighbor's driveway, is the utility truck. 



My BFF wonders out loud if maybe he lived there the whole time. I tell her no. I know who lives there. That anxiety sitting on my chest returns, heart beating full force again. I knew at that moment he was somewhere in my yard and he was watching us the entire time. I judge the distance to the door as about five feet and without saying a word grab my BFF's wrist and dart for it. 





We make it inside and at this point, my fear is turning to rage. I decide to do something I'd never done before: I go into my dad's closet and pull down his shotgun. My BFF says, 



*""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING, MAN? ARE YOU CRAZY? RUBY. STOP. JUST CALL THE POLICE!""*



I'm not entirely sure what happened to me, what clicked, or why all that fear turned to white-hot rage, but it did. I grabbed the cordless phone in my other hand and went straight to the door. Once I got to the perfect center of my driveway, I held up the cordless phone in the air and screamed, 



*""I'M CALLING THE FUCKING POLICE, ASSHOLE. COME AT US BEFORE THEY GET HERE AND I'LL USE THIS.""* 



(Insert bad ass cocking of shotgun here)



As soon as I got on the phone with the police, he pulled up in the middle of the street again, except this time he actually stopped and got out. That's when we saw his face for the first time. The reality was, he didn't even look scary or threatening. He was just a plain-looking Hispanic guy in work clothes. That's it. No warts or rotting teeth or any of the other things one's imagination might manufacture for a crazy night stalker. 



This time, me and the BFF huddled together crying in the bathroom as we waited for the cops. All that bad ass rage melted away and I turned into a little school girl. I felt foolish carrying around a shotgun I wasn't prepared to use (or even sure how to). We both screamed and jumped a few inches when my doorbell sounded. God, we had an awful doorbell. It wasn't a ding, it was more like an angry buzz and it never failed to stop making me jump the twenty years we lived there. 




We got up and ran to the door and could tell by the spot light looking at our address outside that it was indeed the cavalry. Sweet relief washed over us both and we went outside to tell the cops what happened. Right as they are kind of half laughing at us in disbelief, the creep pulls up again slowly. They get in their squad car and he bolts. Blue lights come on, and they're off, too. 




The cops returned about 15 minutes later to tell us how it went down. He cooperated fully with them and said he was just checking a transformer in the area (BS). Since it was his job to be around neighborhoods late at night, there wasn't really anything they could do so they let him go. They did, however, warn him that they'd be watching the house to make sure we were alright. Sure enough, that did the trick and we didn't see him again. 




My parents got home about an hour later, but we didn't tell them what happened. I guess we were scared we'd get in trouble, but we also started doing that thing a lot of people do after something surreal like this happens and we questioned whether or not it was actually in our heads. Did we blow this all out of proportion? Was he just a utility worker, after all?




About six months later, the incident was long forgotten and I was home sick from work laying in bed watching TV. The local news comes on and the top story is the suspension of a local utility worker. 



(But it doesn't hit me yet.)




 The news starts and I hear, 




""A local utility worker was suspended without pay today after he was arrested for charges of indecent exposure and stalking of minors....""




**That's when it hit me.**






They flash his mug shot on the news and indeed.... it was *him*."	t5_2t3t8	True
1359061999.0	177nsi	Brian; Murderer, Rapist, Jesus P3	chelseateach	231	48	68	"**EDIT: Trigger warning. There's a graphic...fight.**

I wanted to put a quick disclaimer before I finished this: I know thousands of millions of people have it worse than I do, and I know this isn't stalking like this subreddit prefers, but I've been seeking somewhere to post what's happened to me for so long. 

See, Brian gets in your head. He tells you everything you don't want to hear. He beats you for such outlandish things, you find yourself doubting if it actually happened. He also had a tenancy of telling you that you do,what he does. For example, he always called me a pathological liar, when in reality all he could do was lie, or calling me autistic and stupid, when he showed obvious signs of mental illness. Regardless, I've been told I'm the bad guy for so long, I have believed I'm the antagonist through this whole thing. 

Thank you for reading this. You have no idea how much it means to me.

Now, it's time for the finale. 

I have made a few friends by the time I'm 16. Most of them know how scary Brian is. In fact, at my mom's birthday party, in front of over 10 people, he thought he saw me knock a knockoff Ipad onto the floor. He ran at me, and held me 2 feet off the ground, by my throat, in front of all of them. I made eye contact with 3 of my friends, and my friend Jon looked like he was about to beat the hell out of him. Jon said, ""Brian."" In an angry voice and he dropped me, and then whispered, ""I'm going to fucking get you later.""

(I should mention, Brian assaulted him once too, before Jon knew he was crazy. He pinned Jon against the wall and shouted, GOD HATES YOU! REPENT! HIT ME! HIT ME! SHOW YOUR TRUE COLORS! WHY DO YOU HATE GOD? Because Jon had work the next morning and didn't want to listen to worship music with him, but wanted to go home. Jon eventually pushed past, and that was the last time he came over.)


Brian decides I need an exorcism. He's done this to me two or three times. I'm 16 years old now and I've been through utter shit, and I know everything he's done is wrong. But I still feel like the bad guy, because he always shouts at me ""You're a rebellious teenager, that's all this is."" So I'm convinced that I just hate him because I'm a teenager. But deep down, I know something has to be done.

So he comes into my room, and says he just saw me use a curse word on Facebook. I tell him I haven't, and he says some girl named Mia is posting all over my wall, and everyone will judge him for it, and she's saying all these slurs. I rush to the computer and see it's on my newsfeed- M.I.A. the singer has posted some raunchy statuses. I try to explain it to him, and he slaps me and calls me an idiot- that my friends are disgusting druggies and he's sick of it, and that he won't be allowed to lead his small group if I ""Keep being trashy.""

I start standing up for myself, and he starts ""speaking in tongues"" and following me back to my room. He's shouting gibberish and flailing his arms, and I don't have time for it. I close my door and lock it, and Brian begins to kick it. Kicking my door in. I shout at him to stop, and he walks away. I think it's over, this is a daily thing for me. Until I hear the sound of a knife clicking. See, he had unlocked my door so many times with knives, if you pop anything metal and thin in it, the lock bursts open. And that's what he was doing. 

He bursts through my door with the knife and begins screaming in tongues, still holding the knife, waving it at me. I panic, and scoot backwards onto my bed, putting my knees up and beginning to cry. He pulls be down by my hair, and I'm flailing and screaming, and he's still holding the knife. He punches me in the stomach, knocking the wind out of me, and while I'm gasping he drops the knife a foot away from my head. He climbs onto the bed and sits on my stomache, over me, and begins to scream in my face, pinning my arms back behind me with both arms, screaming and screaming inches from my face. 

I begin to twitch and scream and sob- I still have a phobia of being held down- and he sits there, over me, his face twisted in anger screaming all the gibberish he can muster up, repeatedly smacking me in the face and shouting ""Demon, OUT!"" while I hear Jack, a mere thin wall away, watching the Golden Girls, having a great time by himself. Every time I close my eyes, Brian slaps. This goes on for an hour and a half, until my mother comes home from the park. He casually calls me trash, gets off of me, and walks out of my room, slamming my door.

That day I had enough. I went online, and began searching him, finding records of his chiropractic license being banned 13 years ago due to ""yelling at a court."" and refusing to stop praying over patients of other religions. That's why he did this. 

I finally contact my moms' family. My twin brothers, my grandfather, my mom's sisters and uncles, that month as I found them. Most of them couldn't offer help or didn't want to get involved. Brian's brother was appalled when he heard my story. He promised to help me, but he's a dirty excuse for a person. I'll get to that later.

It's just me and Brian at home one night. I biked 3 miles home at 11pm, with a flat tire, in the rain with a migraine, calling the home multiple times to come get me.
He's watching crappy television shows. I walk past, and he asks me if I've eaten this week, because ""I don't want MY daughter ending up like the dead girl."" Of course, this sets me off. I run to my room, and he laughs. 

I come back out with a 5 pound weight. He stares at me and laughs, and comments on how I need to work out. I hit myself extremely hard in the gut with the weight, bruising myself. He stops laughing and says, ""What the fuck are you doing?"" and I do it again. He starts to stand up and says ""Don't hurt my daughter!"" 

I start to laugh, this demonic, deep laugh. I know what I'm going to do. I take the weight, and slam it into my ribs, nearly knocking the wind out of myself. He starts to run at me, screaming, ""DON'T FUCKING TOUCH MY DAUGHTER,DEMON!"" and slams me into the wall behind me, bruising my back. I hold my balance and shove his ugly, meaty figure away, merely staggering him. I manage to avoid most of his punches and get a few shoves in. He grabs my hair and holds me up by it, strands of it snapping and putting me into pure agony. I try to scratch his face, which makes him retaliate by more gut punches, but I'm still holding that damn evil smile. I manage to get out of his grasp.

I look at him and say, ""Shut up, you autistic child."" His eyes flare. Nobody's ever said something like that to him. He chases me to my room, and I lock the door just in time to grab the home phone and throw it into my closet where he can't reach it. For some reason I decided this was a good time to change my soaking clothing, but the moment I have my pants off, he kicks the door in, charges at me and THROWS me with all his might into my wooden cabinet behind me. My back cracks, and I hit the back of my neck, instantly giving me a  pounding headache, so badly that my vision begins to blur. I bit my tongue somewhere in the process, so my mouth is bleeding.

I fall down in a heap, and he begins to kick me, screaming about how I'm Satan and I'm Suzy (My mother's sister?) and I'm a whore. I feel bruises all over my body, and I'm aching. My mom immediately comes home, and screams at him to stop, charging at him, and he's distracted for a mere moment.

I pull myself up and follow them out there, feeling like a corpse. She's shoving at him and he's grabbing at her, and she's screaming ""WHAT DID YOU DO? WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER?"" crying and enraged at the same time. At this point he's realized that he can't leave marks or he'll be caught, and is playing defensive, standing up for himself.

I join her for a moment, screaming ""You've messed up, Brian! They're going to catch you!"" pointing at the blood going down my chin. 
I'm proud to say, for one moment, he was scared. He looked like a trapped rat. I spit directly in his face at that moment. Pure blood, right into his face. He retaliated by punching me in the throat, but that one moment was worth it. He looked me directly into the eye and said, ""I'm going to kill you."" and I replied, ""You're going to prison.""

I turned around right then, and dragged myself into my room, locking my door, and pulling myself into a ball, dialing 9-1-1. I began to sob on the phone, and the police were there. They walked inside to find Brian calmly sitting on the couch , acting confused as to why they were there, despite blood still being on his face. The moment the officers saw me, they knew exactly what had happened.

Many photographs,police reports and court dates later, Brian spent some time in jail. I applied to have a restraining order, but guess who showed up to that trial to say that I was the bad guy, and not Brian? His brother, who I begged for help, and my youth pastor. They spoke about how Brian was a great man and didn't deserve to lose his family. Unfortunately, the fact Brian's testimony didn't add up to the one he wrote down that night didn't put him into a good light.

Luckily, before the trial, I found the name of his attorney and sent him a very..very long email. He had to find a new attorney.

His mother still sends me letters, telling me how much ""your dad loves you and misses you"" with money. I have two jobs, I throw the money away.
I wasn't granted the restraining order, but I live with my mom now. She's... Healing. I can talk to her now. She worked on her alcoholism, and her family is helping us move.

I should mention Jack only moved out a few months ago. I went to him for left after Brian left, and asked him why he would let Brian molest me. He was horrified, but told me I had no reason to resent him for not helping, that ""I had no way of knowing and that's your business, not mine.""

I contacted his family, who was horrified to find out their father had been living with a family like a leech, let alone BRIAN. Jack had been lying to them and saying that he had his own home and was still working. They arrived shortly after and confronted him, and I saw at court he had a leg amputated. Not sure why, but hey, fuck him.

Unfortunately, I did not get the restraining order on Brian. But, child services told him he's forbidden to speak to me again, and he still has ""Assault and battery"" on his mugshot available to anyone who googles him.
I hear he's been going to a new church now, running a small group there, flirting with women.

If a middle-aged man named Brian with short, brown hair, scary pale skin, no job and tacky hawaiian shirts wants to hang out with you, run. Just run. 

But this isn't the last time I saw Brian.

1350678136.0	11rkt9	"""You have the most beautiful kids"""		217	35	17	"So this took place quite a few years ago, back when I was in 1st grade. We (my mother and my siblings) lived in a pretty sheltered suburban town with a decent school system. My elementary school had a playground that was open to all students after school until around 7 when the janitors left. We would often go up there and play tag and whatnot. My little siblings were a handful, so as the oldest I was placed in charge while my mother was busy.

One day, we drove up to the playground to chill out, per usual. About thirty minutes after we got there, a green truck parks itself in the school's lot. An elderly man steps out, sees us playing, and calmly strides over to my mother, who was sitting at once of the picnic benches. 

Being that this is the South, my mother engages in a friendly conversation with him. He sits down across from her and they chat away for some time. I'm not paying too much attention to the guy while playing, but being an nonathletic klutz I fall off the monkey bars and badly scrape my legs. As any child would do, I run to my mother and ask her for a band-aid. She's still talking to this guy, so I decide to listen in (my parents tell me I was incredibly nosy as a child)

The man keeps directing the conversation back towards us kids, and when he sees me approach he makes a comment about how wonderful I look. Then he asks if he can help bandage my legs.
Immediately my mom's maternal defenses go up and she starts trying to steer the conversation away from us. He keeps going in circles, though, talking about how he loves to talk to kids and play with them..

I distinctly remember him saying ""You have the most beautiful kids."" Which wasn't too far off--we all had bleach blond hair and stark blue eyes--but the way he said it while eyeballing me told my mother it was time to get out of there.
She sends me back to go collect my siblings while still talking to this guy. I guess he picked up on her change in mood and abruptly says ""Thanks for the conversation,"" and walks away. He gets in this big green truck and drives off.

Not five minutes later, a police car pulls into the lot and a cop gets out. He asks my mother if she's seen a man (description matches the guy at the playground) in a large green truck (which also matched). They told her he had been attempting to pick up kids in his truck over in an adjacent school campus about a week ago. We reported our encounter and then didn't come back to that playground for the rest of the summer.

Not as heart-pounding as some of this stuff on here, but I thought it was worth a post. It's my first, so let me know what you think!

1328241198.0	p8rvr	[FR] Beware of the insane baby snatcher/killer.	candybuttons	211	26	27	"Jenn and Greg lived in a gated comminity in Fla. He worked nights and she stayed home with their 1 year old twins. Every day they went as a family to the neighborhood park where she watched the twins while he ran 3 miles, then he watched them while she ran. Each night he would go to work at 7 and come back for "" lunch"" at around 11 after Jenn and the kids were asleep. Jenn locked the door before she went to bed but Greg always left the door unlocked when he went back to work around midnight. 

One evening while Jenn was getting the kids ready for bed she heard the door open and thought it was her husband. She began to talk to him from the other room until she met the person (not her husband) at the stairs. It turned out to be an older woman. Jenn asked who she was and what she was doing in the house. The woman's response was ""My boyfriend told me there was a party here and he was invited. He can't make it so he sent me to let you know and to bring a dish"". 

Jenn said ""There obviously isn't a party here"" and told the woman she needed to leave. The woman said, ""Okay well there seems to be a mix up, let me call my boyfriend"". She then pulled a news paper clipping of a well known whack-job prophet out of her bra and said ""See, you know him!"" She told Jenn about the church her and her boyfriend were planning on starting where you could drop kids off after you kidnap them. She said without something like this church, ""kidnappers are just killing the kids when they have nothing more to do with them after the fact"". She then pretended to call her boyfriend, when in reality she had a conversation with herself by putting her hand to her forehead when she spoke and taking it off her forehead when he ""answered her"".

Jenn, at this point, was freaking out  trying to get this woman out of her house and away from her twins. So she asked the woman again to leave so she could put her kids to bed. The woman offered to help her put the kids to bed and asked if she could hold one. Jenn said no and tried to move the woman closer to the door. The woman said, ""I can help you put them to bed, I've watched you do it a bunch of times"". Jenn was horrified and yelled at the woman to get out of her house. The woman got mad and said ""You stupid bitch! I want your kids. I should have taken them when I had the chance. I was standing over you guys while you slept, I just wasnt ready to take them yet!"" After the woman said this, Jenn forcefully made the woman leave her house and called 911 and her husband.

The woman stayed in the driveway and the police questioned her and searched her car where they found two car seats and a big box of diapers. It turns out she had been watching them for weeks and planning to take their kids that night.

Later they found out the woman was linked to the kidnapping and death of a baby girl a few towns away."	t5_2t3t8	True
1370473184.0	1fr507	Not me, but my mom was almost Ted Bundy's final victim	arabbel	234	53	28	"My mom has told me this story for years, and I always thought it was cool/sooo creepy. 
This happened two days before Ted Bundy was finally caught.

For background on Ted Bundy, if you need it, he was a serial killer who brutally murdered many, many female victims, always young and pretty, which is exactly what my mother was. Just under two months before this story takes place, he went into a Sorority House at Florida State University and murdered two girls in there, and brutally beat two others. Then he went to a nearby house, and brutally beat up and injured one more, all in the span of about 15 minutes. At the time of this story, that was the most recent of his known murders, but it was later found he actually killed a poor little 12 year old girl between being caught and the college girls' murder. He was handsome and young, and his MO was to be very friendly and charming, and his clean-cut appearance made women trust him.

Now to my (well, my mom's) story. My mother and father had moved to Tallahassee two months prior, and were living in a so-so area of apartment complexes. My dad was in school at FSU, and had a Monday science lab that would let out at unpredictable times, dependent entirely on how long that day's experiment lasted.

My mom had not yet found a job, and was pretty bored most of the day. She'd go walk to campus on Mondays to try and meet my dad if the timing happened to be right, but this particular day his lab had let out before she got there and she didn't see him, so she walked back to their apartment.

As she was walking, she turned the corner onto the street where the apartments were on the other side of the road. Just as she did this, a guy in an orange Volkswagen Beetle (a pretty rare car, at least the color) was coming down the street toward her, and leaned over and waved at her in a really friendly, excited manner. My mother was rather confused - she and my dad didn't really know anyone down there, but she gave a small wave back. They had met another young couple a week before, and for a second she thought it might be the husband, but then thought it would be weird for him to wave so excitedly at someone he only knew a little bit. 

She suddenly felt really uncomfortable about it, and wanted to check to see if he was still around without really obviously turning and looking.  She realized if she crossed the street toward her apartment she could get a good look to her right more naturally. 

As she did so, she saw the car had stopped just across the intersection she had turned the corner around initially.  She could see by the lights that the guy was sitting with his foot on the breaks, and worse, that he had his head tilted up and was blatantly watching her in his rear view mirror.  She also knew the particular duplex he was stopped in front of was vacant, so there was no way he was waiting for someone or anything like that.

My mom was thoroughly freaked out and trying to figure out what to do at this point, as there were no cell phones back then and thus no one she could call, but there was a nice thick tree up ahead a little, and she realized that if she walked behind it, she could then walk away at such an angle that the tree would block his line of vision of her for quite a while, and he wouldn't know exactly where she was.

She did this, and after getting a decent bit further, she peeped around the blocked line of vision, and his car was gone. She figures he realized she was onto him and didn't want to deal with a woman putting up a fight.

As I said at the beginning of the post, Ted Bundy was caught two days later. In an orange Beetle. That was stolen two blocks from my parents' apartment. Bundy would apparently often return cars he'd stolen after using them to murder people, and my mom thinks that's what he was planning on doing, but changed his mind, and that's why he was back in the area.

So yeah. Thankfully my mother was smart and not killed by Ted Bundy, and thus, I exist. Hooray!

Edit: Bundy somewhat famously owned a beige Beetle, but he stole and was caught in an orange one."	t5_2t3t8	True
1368783925.0	1eic6b	I don't think they wanted to teach me Hungarian	courters	209	30	24	"I have wanted to share this here for a while, but was unsure how to begin this. All I can say is relax and tuck in because this is long. Long and horrifying. And changed my perception of whether I was invincible.

I was 22 when I first moved to Europe. A stint in Paris led to a transfer to Budapest. I was pretty excited for this and threw myself into the move. Once there, I didn't have an awful lot of support from my company and had to look for a flat myself. Not knowing the local language nor areas, I was directed to a few websites for searching for flats and being 22 and wanting to have fabulous clothing, I wanted something frugal, but nice. 

I found a flat in the VIII district. No one told me that this was perhaps not the best area for people, let alone foreigners. I went out there in day time and while it was a good 2km or so from the metro station to the apartment building, the road was quiet, leafy, and residential. I didn't think it was a bad part of town at all. For those who have been to Budapest, I was in the back-end of the eighth, near Stadionok, which is now Ferenc Puskas Stadion. This is remarkably close to Keleti Railway.

On my bike, it was only 20 or so minutes to work everyday -- with a bike path! -- so it seemed a real dream. Sure, it was a tiny studio, but it was at a steal of a price with utilities built in. I was jazzed. I took it without looking anywhere else.

Nothing really happened the first few weeks. I moved in towards the end of August when nights were still relatively long and being new to the city I was always home before dark. It was after living there I realised that the street I walked down - Szazados Ut - didn't have many, if any lights on it. Especially when you got further down toward my neck of the streets. The street had quite a bit of construction and new buildings on it, so this has probably since been rectified, but at the time it was just being gentrified. Anyway, as I adjusted to Budapest I made friends and started going out, but I was pretty much always on my bike to and from the city.

Then I got asked out on a date. This was mid October and not wanting to ruin my hair and wear a small skirt I opted to take the metro into town. The date went okay and I was on my way back around 10pm. October in BP can be chilly, so I was wearing a really nice, thick over-coat that came to my mid-thigh and black, warm tights. I also had a scarf on. All in all, when dressed up I looked a little bulked up because the coat was made of really good wool, but I was clearly a girl. I stepped out of the metro, crossed the road, and headed down my familiar walk home.

It was pitch black. New Moon maybe, but whatever. No big deal. Budapest is a super safe city. I got my phone out and had my keys threaded through my hand, so everything was a-okay, I felt. No one else was on the street, a car whizzed by me. 

Now, here we need some back story. There are two roads before you can turn on one road to my building. The building I lived on was accessible from either Ciprus Utca or a small little alley that cut in between it and Tisztes. The alley was really well lit from the building and the construction. The blocks in Hungary are quite long. Right up from Tisztes was a little street to the other direction (across the road) that had an alley before opening up to a Penny Market. From the Penny Market it opened into a parking lot and then a good bit of way to a Petrol Station and a super busy, big street called Hungaria Korut. Distance from the Penny Market to the Petrol Station is a good mile and the alley itself is very dark and tree-leafed.

Anyway, I am so close to home when another car comes by. I'm a little more than halfway to my home, just pass the Penny Market alley, and another two or three minutes and I'd be inside and warm. The car, however, stopped. He was stopped a little bit between the alley to my house and the other turn off. Lights stayed on. Car rumbling. But parked.

I cannot describe the dread I felt. My heart seized up. I immediately stopped walking. It was like my body knew something was wrong, my legs wouldn't work, and I felt my mouth go dry. Here was this weird impasse: this non-de-script car stopped in the middle of the one-way street and me, stopped between it and another road. I could see behind me the lights of the metro station, but it was far away and no way I could run there before the car could catch up to me, even going in reverse. The Penny Market was closed. It seriously felt like minutes while we both stopped. Maybe it was. I just knew walking forward was not an option.

I then thought, okay, it is a dark road, maybe they are having trouble seeing the street sign? Regardless, I knew it was *wrong*, so I made a resolve to cross the road, go to the alley, and as soon as I broke through there, I'd be at a 24 hr petrol stop. No problem. I walked backwards, keeping an eye on the car with purpose in my stride, as if to say I wasn't scared. Spoiler alert: I don't think running a marathon in high heat could produce such a high heart rate as I said. Two steps into it, the car started to slowly back up and I knew this was *not good*, so I panicked-hobble across the street. That's when the passenger door opened and a man who looked like Shrek and the Hulk's love child stepped out. We're talking: bulked out. He was big, beefy, and had a heard better shaped to look like a brick.

My Hungarian at this point could best be described as ""how to order a glass of wine and say thank you"". But I did know how to say ""I don't speak Hungarian"". It's a pretty useful phrase anywhere you go where you don't speak the language, but especially there. Hungary tends to be more mono-lingual than most of Europe, so I liked to be upfront that we might have some communication problems. Regardless, he started to speak me. I didn't know what he was saying, so I sort of just word vomited out in the squeakiest voice ever that I didn't speak Hungarian in Magyar. At this point, I was across the street, but stopped, and trying not to break into a run into the Alley way yet because my heart rate was up and it had quite a bit of debris in it (lots of people threw trash and such there since it was near a dumpster). I kept one eye on him and one eye on my route through the market alley, which was completely silent, pitch black, and would need a solid 1mi run to get to the gas station. 

He looked at me and said, in stunted English, ""get in the fucking car.""

Yeah. Nope. That is not happening. I shook my head a little bit and then, almost like a cartoon he moved and I moved at the same time. We're talking I was off like a bullet. I ran with the wind, bullseye. I'm lazy at the best of times, but somehow I channelled Usain Bolt. I was not hanging around. I cleared one obstacle, jumping over it, but hit a pothole hard on my ankle. As I was running, I had my best friend in Budapest's name highlighted on my phone. I pressed send. When Dave answered I was crouched behind some trash cans and hysterical, telling him someone was trying to get me. He didn't really understand, but told me to STOP TALKING. As he would admit later, he thought I was exaggerating or letting my mind play tricks on me. I could hear the guy looking for me, shouting at his friend, and then cursing in Hungarian before kicking something. Dave was whispering into the phone to go back to the metro, to get to the gas station, to call a cab. There was NO WAY I was going to get off the phone with him. He was methodical and calm, which helped me calm down as I waited there, hidden.

And then. Silence.

No one was there. His footsteps receded. They gave up. I'm shaking like a leaf at this point, especially since the fear has started to recede since I think they are gone, and Dave is pleading with me to hang up, call a cab, and wait for it at the petrol station. But, hey, I'm 22. They must have given up on me, right? And I wanted my home. I had to work the next morning. I couldn't wear what I had on to work. I was stupid. I felt calmer with him on the phone, so I stood up and ask him to just stay on the line with me while I walked home. He really disagreed with it, but I told him I'd be fine, as most 22 year old young adults think. 

I walk out. And there's the car. It's moved down the road and the passenger door is open. I realise they think I ran down the alley to pop out somewhere else. Oh, no, *fuck that*. This time, Dave is right - I need to get the fuck out of there - and I start hustling backwards hoping they don't see me, another car comes behind them and honks impatiently at the guy to move. Reluctantly, I see Wayne Rooney, *sorry*, the other guy get back into the car and the two cars roll off at a snails pass, like they're keeping an eye out. Still, it is a success. I let out a huge sigh. They were gone. Even if they went around to come pass the street again, I would be home, nice and cozy with a cup of tea before they'd find me.

I decide the best course of action is now to just go home. Quickly. Dave still thinks I should really head to the station and get a cab and come to him. But I felt like I'd beaten it and was sort of buzzing on adrenaline, so I just begged him to talk to me until I got home.

As mentioned, there are two entrances to my building. I turned off the alley that led to the first entrance, rather than walking to go down the main road, which was off of Ciprus. On Ciprus, as well, versus this road, cars can turn and drive down it. Ciprus went to a dead-end. I was obviously still really creeped out, but beginning to wonder if maybe I played it up too much, and am just being dramatic. To sort of get over how scared I was, I cracked a few jokes with Dave to slow my heartbeat down, all while nearly running home. I cut through the construction and decided to opt for using the actual key, rather than my code, to open the door, so I had my shoulder holding the phone up, while I got my key ready. I figured I'd do this because though we had a code to unlock the door, you could manually lock the front door, requiring someone to not just have a code, but also have a key to the door. I did not want to be fumbling around that night.

I swear to God that decision saved my life. I had only found out a few days earlier, when I had got back around 3am, that you could do that. I had no idea what the key was until I called Dave in panic on that Saturday about how I was locked out and even though it was taking my code, I couldn't get in. He told me to try the keys on my ring and sure enough: that worked. Funny how that happens, right? That something a few days earlier, by accident, would come to play such an important role. I used my key to unlock my door and as I step inside - chatting amiably with Dave, and probably loudly, which was ridiculous -, I turned to lock the door behind me just as a hand slams against the glass, trying to catch it before it shut.

It was him.

I screamed so loud that Dave promptly also startled and starting shouting at what was wrong, but in the flurry of horror, I dropped my phone. I panicked. I was sort of running in a circle because *what do you even do*? I jammed my key into the door, frantically locking it and praying I wouldn't open it by accident, but wanting another level of security between us. I think I kicked my phone down the corridor, running for the stairs. I just know, I snatched my phone up while the guy pounded on the glass halfway down the hall and nearly fell over from sliding in my heels. I didn't know anyone in the building and I knew the building was probably half empty at the time due to it being new and an investment property for a lot of people (looking to rent - and, now, understanding why people didn't want to rent there). I had no idea who was home or not home. But I knew I heard the shattering of glass as I dashed the flights. Thankfully, I was only a few floors up and I didn't hear anything behind me. I opened my door just enough for me to slip in, so no light would be seen in the window, and pretty much crawled in. I didn't turn a light on, I just locked the door, sat with my back to it, and started to cry.

I didn't leave that position until my friend got there. Sure enough, the glass to the door was shattered, but being that it was a key lock, there wasn't anything to turn so the door wasn't unlocked. Having to go down and unlock the front door for him was the most terrifying walk of my life. I was so scared the guy was waiting in the building for me to emerge. Down there, seeing the glass, it really shook me up. I let him in and I don't think either of us spoke much as we waited for morning.

The next day I broke my lease (I tried to explain but the landlord didn't speak English) and stayed with a friend until the weekend, when I promptly moved myself and sucked it up and paid the higher rent for a place in the city centre.

tl;dr I don't think they wanted to teach me Hungarian."	t5_2t3t8	True
1368161768.0	1e1vwr	The Sewer with a Secret	AAtheist	214	35	44	"I'm a 32 year old male, so there won't be any ambiguously creepy middle-aged men asking me for directions to a gas station or something.  This story isn't much of a page-turner, I apologize in advance, because there's really not a whole lot to it.  But the funny thing is that NO ONE really believes me when I tell them – even my girlfriend of eight years and my own family.  However, in their defense, I do like to be funny quite a bit, I enjoy making people laugh, so maybe it's hard to take me seriously because of this abnormal discovery combined with my personality – that's the best arm-chair psychology I can muster.


Anyway, I don't remember my exact age at the time I found it, maybe around seven or eight years old – I know I was young.  But before I drop the bomb, a quick back story: my siblings and I didn't have the most parental supervision growing up, but we certainly didn't have the least, so that allowed me to explore and roam free through the surrounding neighborhoods and parks more than some, of which I took full advantage.  My parents divorced when I was no more than four years old – mainly because my dad was a severe alcoholic who couldn't get out of bed without having drink, which is in no way relevant to this story.  My mother was left to raise us three kids on a legal secretary's salary while my dad went to rehab, so my parents were going through their own struggles – I'm not knocking them at all, they did a fine job with what they had to work with as parents.  But with my mom trying to juggle so many responsibilities at once, it understandably left the door open for me to “explore.”


With that said, I grew up near Minneapolis, Minnesota (I no longer live there).  During one rare snowless day, I was aimlessly exploring, which brought me to a park about a mile from my home, which is like a light-year to a seven or eight year old.  I think I was with someone else, some other kid drifter, but can't recall for sure.  I remember this park had a distinctly large hill (great for sledding, I once plowed into a tree there).  It also had a little shallow creek, which flowed into a sewer – a sewer with a secret.  The sewer's opening was like a small tunnel, just big enough for a young boy to walk into, which extended underground beneath the park in a straight line.  The light carried a little ways into the sewer's opening, but it got dark quick – really dark, like murder dark.  


It wasn't uncommon to test my bravery by seeing how far into the dark sewer I could walk without shitting my pants in fear.  I should mention that this was around the time after Jacob Wetterling disappeared, and his disappearance was the first time I ever heard of child abductions.  He was around my age, too, so this especially added to the creepy vibe.  I remember being freaked out and consciously worried about being kidnapped all the time – especially with all the media attention it received.  Even though he lived no where near me in a rural area about 80 miles from the city, my young mind had no awareness of distance; it happened down the street for all I knew.
  

During this particular game of bravery, I was slowly shuffling into the sewer, about ten feet in, where the light was still illuminating the way.  That's when I discovered there was another mini-sewer tunnel to my left, on the wall, but much too small to travel through.   That's when I saw something - I noticed an object just laying there in the entrance of the mini-sewer, like it was put there.  As I approached, I remember thinking it was a fish or something, but oh how wrong I was.  As I got closer, I kept keenly inspecting it, and noticed it was fleshy with veins sticking out of one end.  Fear slowly consumed me as the reality of what it was hit me.  I was staring at a severed human penis.  I saw the mushroom part, the lifeless, flacid shaft, and the brutally frayed entrails that used to be attached to a body.  


I wish I could tell you that I ran to the police, or that I ran home to tell my mom and she called the police.  But I honestly don't remember.  I do know that I never went back to “check on it.”  But I didn't tell anyone for years, and it wasn't intentional; it was just so surreal, I guess, that I must have just chalked it up to part of our game of bravery we played – like it was make believe, or the wild imagination of a child, although I know it wasn't my imagination.  To me, that severed penis is still a secret of that sewer... and will haunt it until that sewer is no more.


But I know what I saw.  That day, I know I saw a weiner in that sewer.  I know this story isn't as creepy per se as many of the others I've read on here, I don't even know if it really belongs here.  But I do know one thing: whoever put that weiner there, in that spooky sewer, whether you or anyone else believes me or not, I would prefer not to meet."	t5_2t3t8	True
1352671577.0	1311o2	I don't go to family reunions anymore... 		228	46	24	"Forgive me if this is a bit scattered, this is a memory I had tried to block out for a long time. 
I wasn't for than 9 years old when my grandmother died. My family is, to sum it up, Irish pot smoking hippies, so it wasn't much of a surprise when there was a keg a few feet down from her jar of ashes at the memorial service. 

I was basically attached to my 19 year old cousin's hip. He was always very kind and didn't mind bringing me around with him. I remember that he went and rented fishing gear to keep me entertained. After a while he had to leave so I was back at the deck area with all the adults, most of whom were a little intoxicated at this time. My mom's been sober for a while now but she did struggle with alcohol abuse, so it wasn't a big shocker for me when she was sloppy drunk at a table. I told her I was going to go play with another male cousin of mine. This is where my memory is a little more shaky, I tried to block this out from the day after it happened.

 He was about 16 or 17 at the time. I remember we walked around and looked at taxidermy at the weird little nature ""museum"" that was there. He stared at me a lot. I remember when we were walking towards the woods, there was a biking/hiking path, he told me I needed to stay with him. He told me I was ""exactly the kind of girl some guy would want to fuck because I had more cushion for the pushin'"". I was young but I knew what he was saying wasn't right. There was something about him and the way he tried to hold me close to him that scared me. We were probably 30 yards into the trail when I realized I needed to get away from him. I  pretended to be looking at something on the ground and let him get a few feet away from me, then I took off. I ran as fast as I could even though I could hear him yelling at me and chasing me. When I got back my mom was close to passing out but I stayed by her and my aunts. He made some lame lie up to them because they'd asked why I came running. He told them I'd seen a snake and it scared me.

I'm 16 now and I had thought that I was passed all of this. Last month I kept having reoccurring nightmares about his face and him chasing me. I told my mom about it for the first and she held me while I had a panic attack. I don't know what would have happened but no matter what anyone says, I know it wouldn't have been good.

I had been sleeping in my bed when I heard the doorbell. Who in the world could that be? It was almost 1 a.m., and I lived in a mostly quiet neighborhood. I looked out my window to see a Pizza car in the cul-de-sac. I couldn't see what company, but the lights were on. All of a sudden I hear a loud BANG on our front door. WE DIDN'T ORDER A PIZZA! Now I was scared. Pizza people are probably not supposed to be rude like that. 

I waited for maybe 3 seconds, when he pounded on the door even more. My mom woke up too, and she called the cops. When they came, the car sped off. I don't know why, but the police didn't even try and get them. The officer asked my mom what happened and she said someone was trying to get inside the house. He told us to lock our doors and left. 

On the local news the next morning, we saw a story on a man who had been shot after letting a pizza man come inside. We ran to our door and saw that where he had pounded was an indentation of a hand. We were scared shitless. I don't know of he was caught, but he  didn't come back. Scariest thing I've ever encountered."	t5_2t3t8	True
1348619512.0	10hb36	Be careful who you try to help	ELTepes	212	36	24	"My first post to Lets Not Meet.

I live in a small town of, not quite, thirty thousand people. For about two years, I worked as a gas station attendant on the graveyard shift. Most nights I would have little but steady traffic through the station. We had several pumps that were for large trucks only, so I would normally get lots of regulars from nearby trucking companies. The only exception to this was on holidays, when those companies were closed.

Holidays were slow and boring but, it gave me time to catch up on my reading so I wasn't all that bothered by it. One such night, (can't recall which holiday it was) I walked out of the backroom and happened to see a truck speed into the parking lot and go through a part of the parking lot that isn't visible from the store windows.

I thought they might have been pulling though, so I thought nothing of it until a woman walked in about five minutes later. I couldn't see a vehicle so I assumed that the truck had been hers. The station had several cameras but, all of them tended to be pointed at the pumps or at the registers so there were several blind spots. A lot of people did this however so it didn't raise any major flags.

This woman was very...dirty. She looked to need a bath and, her clothes had seen better days. Again, this is nothing new to this area as there was a neighborhood full of meth dealers and addicts about half a mile away and we were one of the only gas stations open past 11 p.m..

She started in with a story about how she was from out of town and her car had broke down on the interstate (this makes me think that it might have been around Thanksgiving or Christmas because we got a lot of these stories). She didn't ask for money but, wanted me to come outside and look at some cameras she owned to sell them to me to get money for gas.

Her story was immediately full of holes. She had said that it broke down on the interstate. Besides the fact that gas wouldn't fix a broken car, the interstate was four miles on the opposite side of town and there was another station open right next to it(same owner and franchise as mine). There was also the fact that she kept calling them ""really nice cameras"", but in my head I thought ""they can't be that nice from the look of you"". It might have been a mean thought but, oh well.

I asked her how she'd gotten here without gas and she told me that a friend dropped her off. I told her that I wasn't carrying any cash on me, which was the truth, but I wouldn't have done it anyway. She then asked me again to come outside and look at them and trade them for cash in the drawer.

That's when the reality of it kicked in. She didn't want me to buy anything. She wanted me to come outside, off camera and away from anything I could use to defend myself.

At that point I picked up the phone and told her I'd call the non-emergency line for 911 and see if they could help her. She couldn't make excuses fast enough to get out of the store. Not twenty seconds later I see the truck pulling out from the blindspot and hauling ass. This time I could see that there were two people in the truck.

I called the other open stores (there were four stores, one at each end of town) and warned them not to go outside with her if she came by. I called the police after that. When they showed up they told me that I was smart not to go outside. They told me at best one was waiting for me to leave the store so he could jump me and then rob the store. Worst case, I might have gotten stabbed, which happened a lot in that nearby neighborhood.

The story doesn't end there. She came back around 6:30 bugging people in the parking lot for money but luckily it was full by that point so no one was in that much danger. I called my assistant manager, who had just arrived and she recognized the woman. She was a prostitute that they had to chase off every once in a while when she harassed the truckers. She wasn't from out of town but, that neighborhood just down the road. We called the cops but she was gone again before they arrived.

Because of the report I had to stay longer than normal. I was finishing up by taking out the trash and I decided to throw the bags in the back of my truck and take them all at once than a few at a time.

As I finished throwing away the trash. The same truck came speeding in and blocked in my truck. I figured they came for some payback. The parking lot had thinned so I figured there would be trouble. Instead she starts giving me a different sob story and asking for money. I pulled a baseball bat from my truck and just started screaming obscenities at her and telling her never to come back. She jumped in the truck and they took off. Never saw her again.

TL;DR creepy prostitute tries to lure me outside, possibly to rob/murder me.

----
It was so late, technically morning. I was drowned in textbooks and papers at our campus library, nodding off while trying to study. Screw this. I gathered everything, shoved all my stuff into my backpack and started to head home.

As I darted out the library doors and dragged myself to the street, something felt strange. There were still a few people out-- after all night life never slept in a city like this. But I realized as I kept walking to my apartment, somebody was going in my direction.

My peripheral vision saw a man, likely middle aged. I quickly turned random corners, hoping he was not following me. But every corner I turned, he turned too. Ahh I'm going crazy. I thought to myself. But to be safe I quickly walked to a nearby convenient store. I waited in there, watching him. He seemed preoccupied and I realized he probably wasn't following me at all. He walked past, as if nothing was strange. I felt a wave of relief.

""Late night studying? What exam?""

I turn to see one of my friends. She seems tired too, clinging onto her heavy backpack. She walked in to grab a snack, so we decide to quickly heat up some cheap ramen and eat before heading back.

As we finished our food we started walking back together. Why is it that at night everything seems farther away? We agree we'll meet up tomorrow. As we approach the street where we part our ways, I waved goodnight to her.

There he was. I freeze. He was walking in her direction. I don't know what to think, and suddenly I'm clouded with fear and doubt. He didn't seem like he was following her, and her apartment complex was quite huge. I decided I was overreacting and walked home.

My friend and I meet up later; I go to her apartment to chat about school. As she prepares a quick snack, I turn on the news.

Yoo Young-Chul. 5 am. Captured. 21 victims. Serial killer.

As my friend walks in with some food, she freezes. She watches the screen as all that's heard from the t.v. is shouting, people causing chaos.

""Hey! What's going on with that man?"" She asks, pointing to the alleged serial killer.

""I saw him last night. On the elevator after I separated from you.""
I freeze. I don't know what to say to her. She doesn't realize why he's in handcuffs; I don't want to tell her. I ask her to explain what happened.

She was walking back to her apartment, and stepped into the elevator. A middle aged man stepped in with her; nothing unusual. The elevator doors began to slide until only a sliver of the outside was left. Suddenly, a hand shoots through and the doors burst open. A familiar looking older man stumbles in. Ah, she recognizes him. Her neighbor who lived alone. He was quite old, and they weren't very close. But that night he smelt of soju. He smacked his arm around her and giggled.

""Studying at this lively hour? You're mother must be so proud!""

Oh god. She politely escorts him out the elevator and walks him to his place. He pats her on the head and tells her to keep up her studies. They exchange good byes and she walks back.

""I remember the other man's face. I kept staring at him and whispering apologies, feeling embarrassed by my tipsy neighbor. He looked back at me, but he seemed quite emotionless like he wasn't bothered at all. His face..... that's him. I swear.""

Suddenly she goes pale when she hears the words I heard earlier.

5 am. Captured. 21 victims. Serial killer.

She wants to talk to her neighbor. She quickly runs next door and knocks loudly. The neighbor opens the door and greets her.

""Last night, um, I walked you back. You seemed tipsy. I was just wondering if you were alright.""

He smiles. ""This is going to sound strange, but I was walking back, and I noticed you and a man walk into the elevator. Something seemed off, I couldn't explain. I don't know why, but I had to ride that elevator and take you back. I think it might have been the alcohol that made me do it.""

Even to this day, I wonder what to really think. If not for her tipsy neighbor, would she be alive? Would Yoo Young-chul have been captured? How many more deaths would occur?

Sometimes, it's the strangest and smallest things that make one lucky."	t5_2t3t8	True
1365709914.0	1c5mnf	My Uncle - Finally Getting This Off My Chest	Arat90	222	42	49	"**WARNING: This is going to be a wall of text**

I can’t help the way I write, I like to include as many details as I can and it usually ends up creating huge walls of text.  I’m not going to provide a TL;DR, so sorry in advance if that’s what you’re looking for, you should probably hit the back button now.  Thanks to whoever decides to read this, (:



As a long time lurker, I’ve finally mustered up the guts to share some incidents that occurred in my life that not many people know about.  Thank you LetsNotMeet for all of your stories and giving me the courage to finally talk about this in detail.  I know what happened to me is pretty minor compared to most of the stories I’ve heard here, but it still traumatized me.  My memory of everything feels like swiss cheese, but I’ll try my best to remember everything.




I think the first time I met my uncle was when my family moved to Michigan.  I had to have been around 6 or 7 at the time.  Just to clarify, he was a first cousin of my mom’s side of the family.
My mom’s side of the family is enormous, and back in those days we used to gather every weekend for the adults to eat and drink, and for the kids to play and hang out.  It was during one of these gatherings when I met him.  I remember he smelled like smoke and his fingers were cold when they pinched my cheeks.  I greeted him just like I was supposed to and ran off to play with my brothers and cousins.  He was really funny and nice, just like the rest of my aunts and uncles.



Some things  I think you should know before I continue on with this story is that my family, and culture in general, is a lot more touchy feely than your average family, and there was a more traditional way of raising kids.  It’s not uncommon at all for adults, and kids alike, to be patting butts, kissing and pinching cheeks, and hugging.  It’s just one of the main ways we show our affection for each other.  When someone older than you is speaking to you, you have to address them in a specific way.  You always show your elders respect, and you always listen to them.  If they are older, you are at their mercy.



So anyway, back to the story.
I would soon find out that my uncle was not like the rest of my family.

There was the first instance I can remember that occurred shortly after we had moved.  I was playing outside in the front lawn with my brothers.  They had moved on to playing tag or something like that, and I was a couple feet away just derping around.  My uncle pulled up to the curb and got out of his car.  He had this thing where every time I saw him, he would kneel down and ask me to kiss his cheek.  This was normal, at least the first few times it was.
I think my mom was looking for an apartment for us to move into because we were living with a couple aunts and uncles and their kids in a smaller condo at the time.  My uncle asked me if I could go with him and show him where the apartment was.  At the time I didn’t think it was strange for him to ask me that, I guess because I always wanted to make people happy as a kid.  Looking back, it makes no sense.  How the fuck would a 6-7 year old know directions to an apartment building multiple cities away?
I ended up saying no, sorry, and was about to go back to my brothers when he grabbed my arm and said I should go with him anyway to keep him company.  I thought I should go with him because he’s my uncle, he’s an adult and like I said, you always listen to your elders.  By the way, nowadays I fucking hate my family.  My extended family, that is.
So we’re driving and I’m in the front passenger seat.  I don’t remember anything we talked about or how long the ride was, I don’t even remember where he actually took me or where he dropped me off.  I just remember him reaching over and rubbing my legs, which was normal…I think.  But then he put his hand down my pants, which was not normal.  I laughed thinking he was just kidding with me and tried moving his hand, but he just shoved harder until he was right there, between my legs.  I don’t remember what happened after that, I just remember thinking, “I don’t think this is right….I don’t think uncles do this”.



I didn’t tell anyone about what happened because I thought it was a onetime thing, my stupid child brain saw it as him having an “off day”.  The following visits would consist of his ritual of making me kiss him on the cheek, except he started to grab my head and kiss me on the lips.  This was not normal.  It was way too sloppy and wet, and forceful.  No one ever forced me to kiss them.  He would grab my butt whenever he saw me, harder and rougher than anyone normally would.  It seemed like whenever I got within arm’s length he would reach out and grab me to run his hands all over me.  When other people were around he would hug me or put me on his lap but leave one of his hands between my legs.  It was highly unsettling and made me feel horrible.  I didn’t know whether to run and cry, start punching him, or tell someone.  A big part of me knew what he was doing was bad, the other part of me thought I was the bad one for not “listening” to him.  Sometimes the way you’re brought up can really mess with you.



Fast forward a couple years later when I’m in 5th grade or middle school.  I don’t think I had seen him in a while at this point.  I was home with one of my brothers, eating dinner in the kitchen.  My brother was playing games on the computer in his room.  Someone knocked at the front door so I went to move the curtain to see who it was.  My uncle stood alone, smiling at me.  I was overcome with a hodgepodge of panic, fear and disgust.  I reluctantly let him in.  
He made me kiss him and grabbed my butt while I tried to pull my face away.  I waited for him to sit down, then took the seat farthest from him.  I think he asked me random questions about school and where everyone was.  I kept my answers short, even had a light spritz of hatred with them.  I wanted to scream “GET OUT OF HERE, WHY ARE YOU HERE?!?!”.  He asked me to make him some food…..which consisted of a microwaved hotdog.  I wanted to leave the kitchen and go in my brothers room but he kept talking to me.  I was scared the entire time trying to figure out what might happen.  To my surprise, after I don’t know how much time had passed, he got up and announced he was leaving.  I felt the relief wash over me as I watched him put on his shoes.   He put his hand on the doorknob and I walked closer, getting ready to close and lock the door once he left.  As I walked toward him, he turned around quickly and grabbed me with both hands.  He half bear hugged me, grabbing my butt and holding me against him as he stuck his tongue in my mouth and positioned me against the door.  I had no idea what had happened, all I could do was register the fact that I was in a very bad spot and my mouth smelled/tasted like smoke.  I tried escaping his hold but he only pushed against me and squeezed harder.  I felt his hand go underneath my underwear and his fingers started to move.  I couldn’t believe what was happening to me, I wanted to scream for my brother but his mouth was covering mine.  After what seemed like forever, he stopped and let go of me.  I backed several feet away from him.  He brought his fingers up to his nose and closed his eyes.  Then the sick bastard smiled, said goodbye and left.



Several more years passed.  I was in high school and I remember there were many occasions where my mom told me he wanted offered to pick me up from school or take me to run errands to “help out”.  I would instantly become furious and demand that I be left out of the equation.  These were the rare times I would raise my voice and scream at my mom.  She would freak out on me and wouldn’t understand why I was acting the way I was, but I could never bring myself to tell her why.  I just felt like there was a huge boulder on top of me, preventing me from screaming from the top of my lungs that he had violated me and that I wanted to gouge his fucking eyes out.  I later found out that he had done similar things to several of my cousins and some of their friends, and even to my brothers.  We never talked about it in detail together, it was just an unspoken known thing that he was touching us inappropriately.  There was a time where one of my cousins and I finally told an aunt.  She told our moms.  They didn’t believe us.  My aunt told us never to be alone with him again.  The older I got, the angrier I became.  I hated him so hard.  Every time I saw him I would walk in the opposite direction to avoid him.



I’m 23 now and sometimes he’ll show up at other people’s houses.  I still get panicky and frightened when I see him.
I think it’s time I end this story.



As I’ve mentioned in the beginning, a few people in my life know about what happened, but not the full details.  Spelling out the details for the first time has been pretty emotionally and mentally laborious.  Thank you so much for allowing me to get this off my chest, and I hope this can help someone in some small way.

1346454200.0	z5s77	I was nearly kidnapped.	darthpickles	214	38	35	"My apologies in advance if I do anything incorrectly, I've been lurking for quite awhile, and decided to finally tell my story. Just for clarification, I'm female. 

When I was 7, I was camping with my parents and baby sister in Virginia. We were staying in a campground specifically for RV's, but there were also some cabins available to rent. On the first day there, after being constantly pestered to ""take me to the park"" my dad complained to my mom that I was old enough to walk the short distance to the park and play without supervision. My mom has always been very overprotective and a worrier, and even more so after this camping trip. My mom finally gave in and allowed me to go alone to the campground park. 

While at the playground, I met a little girl around my own age, and we played together for awhile. She was also by herself. I invited her to come back to my RV to play with Barbies with me and we headed in that direction. On the way, we crossed paths with my parents, who were going to another family's RV to visit and socialize. We let them know we were going to play Barbies in my family's RV. After we played for a little while, she suggested we pack up the Barbies and go to the cabin she and her grandparents were staying in to play with her Barbies too, which we did. It never even occurred to me that my parents didn't know this girl or her family or where I would have gone. They had assumed we were going to stay in my RV and play. 

We played at her cabin for a long time, and while we played, her grandparents were packing up their things and preparing to leave the campground. When they were all packed up to go, they said they would drop me back off at my RV on their way so I wouldn't have to walk. Obviously, my parents had always told me to never get in a car with a stranger, and I knew this... but it just never occurred to me that this was exactly what they meant. I genuinely never felt remotely afraid or concerned about the situation. The little girl's grandparents packed up their car, and we all climbed in. We stopped at the campground's general store, and her grandpa bought us both ice cream cones. All I could think was how nice and generous her family was! 

We got back in the car, and I assumed they would next be dropping me off at my RV. I sat in the car eating my ice cream and talking with my friend, completely oblivious to the outside of the car. Suddenly, my door flew open and my dad, with tears pouring down his cheeks, yanked me out of the car and hugged me harder than he ever had in my life. I was so confused... and then the car I was in sped away, very quickly. It was then that I realized that we were at the exit of the campground. 

Apparently, upon returning to our RV, and finding my new friend and me gone without a trace, my parents had contacted the ranger station and a lot of people were out looking for me, in the woods and going door to door to the other RV's. My dad just happened to be walking by as he saw me in the people's car, just about to leave the campground. I don't know who those people were but they definitely had no intention of bringing me back to my parents. I think the ice cream was  bought to distract me from noticing we weren't heading in the direction of my own campsite. Over the years, I've often thought of that day and how different my life could be if my dad hadn't seen me just in the nick of time."	t5_2t3t8	True
1360196090.0	1816oj	The Walk In The Rain	potatosmiles	212	33	53	"Hey guys, after a a day or two of reading these stories, it sparked something that happened to me quite a few years ago. I haven't told anyone the complete context of this story, only a summarized version to a few people, but it haunted me as a kid. If you're in for a good ""holy fuck that's fucked"" read, you're in for it. What you're about to read is 100% true. I'll begin.

It was back when I was about 10 years old (17 now), and I was walking to my friend's house. It was on a Saturday around noon time, and my friend lived about a 5 minute, if not less, walk from my house. About halfway through the walk, a rain storm came out of no where. Being 10 years old and just wanting to get to my friend's house, I decided against running back for a jacket. When I reached the street off of my friend's street, an inconspicuous white van pulled up beside me. The sliding door swung open, and a lady in her early 30's asked me if I wanted a ride, as it was raining out and I had no jacket. Being a very safe kid, I told her I was going to a friend's house just up the street and that I was fine; to which she insinuated that I had to get in with them, and that they'd drive me there.

A little backstory on the van: In my southern Ontario city, at this time, there was constant news reports of, and I kid you not, a white van abducting numerous children; and actually I believe one of the children believed to be abducted by this van was actually killed. The van was described as a white Dodge Caravan, and I always remembered this because it was the same type of van my Mother drove, but she drove a blue one.

Anyways, back to the story. So as I told the van I was fine, the remembrance of the story of the white van sparked into my mind. The van was known by the locals as ""Old Grump"", as an elderly man with a forwards ballcap was always seen driving it; and I was absolutely mortified when I looked towards the drivers seat to see an old man with a ballcap at the wheel. I'm even getting chills thinking about this, let alone being alone on a street with these creeps in front of me.

When I noticed the old man, I remembered more details of the van, the obstructed or non-existent plates. Considering I was about two feet from the back of the van, I glanced to look at the license plates, which were obscured by a garbage bag. The total time elapsed between the van pulling up, me saying no, the lady trying to get me inside and the realization of the situation was probably about 45 seconds.

When I realized what could possibly happen, I told her I really had to go, I fucking darted out of there. I have never moved so fast in my entire life. As I began to run, I heard the lady curse ""fuck"" and the door come whirring shut. the van began to accelerate again, but luckily for me, after cutting across a few lawns, I was maybe 20 meters from my friend's house.

As I reached my friend's house, I recall jumping over the water run off between his and his neighbour's house and coming to their porch stair case. Now most houses in my area have maybe 2-4 steps and then their front door, but my friend, living in a condo
had about 15 steps, with their door being about 2 meters off of the ground. I sped up the steps as fast as I could, pounded on his door, and looked through the glass and saw him slowly walking towards the door. At this point I was screaming ""Cody, for God's sake, open the door!"", and then turned around to see the van just arriving across the street, maybe two doors down (in a suburban neighbourhood, so maybe 50 feet away). My friend perked up and bolted towards the door, quickly unlocked it and I rushed inside.

To save some time, I summarized the story to him. We were both 10 years old and just intended on an afternoon of playing some Tom &amp; Jerry's style street fighter on PS2, when this whole ordeal happened. We panicked, and didn't know what to do; his parents weren't home, nor were mine, and wouldn't dare go outside to fetch help from the neighbours. We were on the border of calling the police.

This is where it gets real fucked up.

We picked up the phone, but the line was dead. No calling the police. It sounds extremely bullshit, but the area was only a few months old, so the phone and internet was extremely unpredictable; and with the now harsh weather, it was no surprise that the line went dead.

We layed down on his living room floor (it hid us from plain sight and allowed us to look out the front window) and began peering outside with a pair of mini binoculars he had in his room. Sounds extremely BS, but we always used to play army outside and shit, so even though the life-threatening circumstances, we wanted and excuse to use the binoculars.

My friend handed them to me, and I brought them to my eyes. I looked outside, and to my surprise: no one was in the van anymore. Completely empty. I handed them to my friend, and he stopped his breathing. I remember whispering ""What is it, dude? What? Dude?"" and then before he answered, banging began on his garage door. Dead. Fucking. Serious.

We almost fucking pissed ourselves, I was on the verge of crying, my buddy Cody was frozen solid and we didn't know what to do. Considering it was a condo, the garage was in close proximity to where we were (the living room, 15 feet from the front door), we could hear everything. We heard the handle on the garage being fumbled with, so we grabbed kitchen knives, and proceeded down the stairs, silently. When we got to the bottom of the first flight of stairs, Cody remembered in a moment of panic that his Dad's, I believe, Uncle lived in the bottom flat to the condo, and was possibly home. We pushed open his door, and began calling out his name, Brian. He wasn't there.

We were petrified, but felt a sense of security because we had two big fucking kitchen knives; as well as Cody was a black belt in karate and could kick the shit out of kids twice his size. With our knives, we proceeded into the garage. Scared my heart was racing so fast that these creeps might hear it, we silently listened to the noises outside from the garage, communicating in gestures. The attempts to gain access to the house were sporadic, and occurred over a time frame of about 15 to 20 minutes. Eventually, everything ceased. I held my breath and my heart stopped beating. After about 20 seconds of staring at the garage handle, we heard a single word: ""Fuck."". It was the voice of a man, and that single ""fuck"" rung through my ears like a bullet and caused me to not sleep for nights on end. After standing there in shock and fear, afraid to move, we gathered the courage to make our way back upstairs. A few minutes later, there was a ring at the door. My heart dropped, and I'm almost certain my nuts did, too. We proceeded cautiously with our knives in hand, when we peered through the peep-hole, we saw a Rogers (telephone company here in Canada) worker at the door with a clip board. We opened up the door and bombarded this guy with questions, eventually amounting to asking if he was the one trying to enter the house.

He wasn't.

The van started up and left.

Edit: You might be asking why no neighbours began to take action; my friend lived on the very corner of his dead end (at the time) street, in an area that was still developing. There were actually only about 7 other houses on his street that were occupied, and he only had one neighbour, who was never home. The chances are slim that anyone would have seen this whole thing go down.

Edit 2: You may be angry about the cliche opening of the door, but read this: We opened the door because the dude was in uniform, and we had knives in our hands, pointed directly at his throat. I realize it sounds dumb, but this worker was always ringing my friends door bell to come in to check the meters etc., as it was a developing area; so he recognized him as a familiar person.
We were also in an extreme moment of panic, and you have to understand that we were also 10, so the added urgency of the situation resulted in some poorly thought out judgements.

1355385680.0	14ryi9	The Long-Term, Multi-Generational Stalker	shakha	209	31	37	"This story is very unusual. It didn't necessarily happen to me, as it happened to all of my family. As a result, I have asked a few questions to place everything together.

A bit of background is necessary. I have been in Canada for the majority of my life, but I was born in Iran, where I spent the first eight years of my life. Also, it may be important to note that my dad had already gone to Canada to get things set up (get a house, job, etc.), so we could go join him. In the mean time, it was just my mom, my two older, but still teenage, sisters and me, the token man in the house. I do not recall this original incident, but since I figure the story will make the most sense chronologically, this is where we must begin. My mom got a phone call one day. A woman told her that a document had arrived for her and that she should wait for it to be delivered. My mom obviously got excited. This was the time where we were working on immigrating to Canada. So, she waited...and waited...and waited. No documents, maybe a wrong number, maybe someone fucking with her, whatever. A few weeks later, in the middle of the night, my mom gets another phone call. It's that woman again. She asks my mom if she was still waiting for the documents. My mom is still convinced that there was just a miscommunication, until the woman tells her ""wait, I'm gonna come over tonight"" and hangs up. I remember this night, because my mom freaked out and called some good family friends who came over and spent the night. No one showed up. My mom says that the woman called occasionally, once every couple of months or so, and whenever my mom asked her name, she would hang up.

Fast forward, we have been in Canada for close to a decade. We are two continents and an ocean away. This incident is pretty much forgotten. One day, the phone rings. My mom picks it up and starts talking to a Persian woman. This woman seems to know everyone fairly well, asking how they are and all that. My mom starts to wonder who she's talking to, but every time she asks, this woman changes the subject. They have a long conversation and hang up, feeling better about it. Such a pleasant phone call. She calls again tomorrow. My mom again has a long conversation with her, but she's slightly more annoyed now. She keeps pushing her for an identification, until the woman finally says ""do you remember that time when I told you that I had some documents for you?"" My mom suddenly realizes who she's talking to and this only encourages her. By the end of the month, we were receiving dozens of phone calls at all hours of the day and the night. Our house always had that ringing tune playing. We would have to resort to unplugging the phone and when we plugged it back in, as if on cue, it would ring. At first, if someone other than my mom answered, she would ask for her. After a while, after a few abusive comments from me and my sisters, she wouldn't talk at all if anyone other than my mom picked up.

Eventually, she got bored. Unfortunately, it wasn't the type of bored we wished for. She started finding other numbers. She would call my aunts and uncles, who were spread across three continents, as well as my dad's cell, my sister's work and my brand new cellphone, whose number I had not given anyone, let alone this psycho bitch. Not only was she getting all these numbers, but she also had a lot of information.

My mom may have encouraged things a bit, because she actually used this woman for news and gossip about the family. This woman knew more about my mom and dad's families than my mom and dad. She also found a preferred target: my mom's mother. She would call her and have chats with her. One time, she pulled a similar prank on her. She told her that she wanted to go for a ride. When my grandmother looked out of her window, she claims that there was a car there. I don't know if I believe this, but this is a woman who has access to people in four or five different countries. No one really knows where she is.

This story isn't really very chronological now that I think about it, so here are some more odd events.

My parents took a trip to Iran once to visit family. They wanted it to be a surprise, so they didn't tell anyone ahead of time. They were going to get a hotel room and then drop in on some family. Except, when they got to the airport, my uncle was there to pick them up. When they asked how my uncle knew, he said that he had received a phone call saying that they were coming. Every house they visited on that trip got a phone call, while they were there.

More recently, my uncle (different uncle) died. It was sudden and my mom and her siblings decided that it would be better if they didn't tell my grandmother, who was living with us at this point. The news was not wide-spread at this point. My uncle's roommate had called my aunt, whose husband drove over and told my dad who told my mom. Well, we get that trusty phone call, except she doesn't want to talk to my mom, but rather my mom's mom. When my mom pushes her to tell us why, she says that she wants to tell her about her dead son.

There was also a period of time where we would get a series of calls that were just white noise with some music in the background or people talking, as if someone dialed and put the phone on a table. This woman claims that that's not her, so either we had two people constantly calling us or someone's lying.

Well, this story is slowly going nowhere fast, so I'll try to provide something of a conclusion. Everyone got sick and tired of this one day and decided that something must be done. So, they went to the police. This woman always called from blocked numbers and the one time when her number wasn't blocked, it was a calling card. Anyways, the police looked into it a bit and said that it was impossible to tell where she was calling from and that we would need to hire a private detective, which we weren't going to do. Since then, the calls have been fewer. I make a point of screening ALL calls now and we often get callers that don't leave a message, but it's difficult to tell if they're her or just people who don't want to leave a message. I guess we'll find out how good she is by whether or not the calls increase after I post this. After all, if she could find my new cell phone number, finding a reddit account would be a cakewalk.

WOW, seriously, sorry about the length. I can only hope that it's an entertaining read, despite of it."	t5_2t3t8	True
1354014488.0	13vaaz	"""Why aren't you running?"""	sophomoresam	220	42	25	"Hi, Reddit. This just happened to me about 20 minutes ago. I'm sitting in my dorm room, safe and sound. But my heart is still racing, and I keep looking out my window every five minutes.

Anyway, it's currently 5 AM. I just got back from the library. I'm a sophomore in college, and it's getting close to final exam time. During finals season, our library stays open 24 hours so students have a place to study, etc. 

Tonight, I decided to utilize the 24 hour plan to finish a biology paper. It took me longer than I thought, but I got out of there around 4:45. My dorm is about a 5-8 minute walk from the library, but at 4 in the morning, everything is a hell of a lot more eerie. 

So, I start walking, and there's this huge spotlight that's shining down on a construction site. It's super creepy at night, but I've learned to get over it. Anyway, I'm walking back, freezing my ass off, when I hear the sound of shuffling feet. I turn around, and I see a dark figure (this person was out of the light being cast by the spotlight, so I couldn't see them). This freaked me the fuck out immediately, but I just kept on going. I could see my dorm in the distance. 

As I'm rounding a corner, I hear the footsteps behind me pick up. I don't turn around, because there is someone approaching me. I'm the only one in the spotlight at this point, and the person coming at me is cast in shadow. But I hear a deep, booming voice shout, ""Why aren't you running?""

This both confused and startled me, and I sped up, going out of my way to maneuver away from the person coming at me. The person behind me stepped into the light, but a black hood covered their face. I began SPRINTING to get to my dorm, and I could hear their feet pounding along on the pavement behind me.

""Run! Run!"" they both whooped and shouted, laughing maniacally. I ran to my dorm, pulled open the door, and turned around to see the Hooded Guy standing right outside. I grabbed the door's handle and pulled it while he also pulled. We were playing tug-of-war with the door.

My dorm has a small area where we swipe our ID badges so we can be let into the residence hall. This area is right inside the door. So it's like a very small, enclosed area. So, while I struggled to keep the door shut with my left hand, I swiped my ID with my right (thankfully my ID was on a lanyard that I kept), so it was easy to get to. The main door swung open, and I jumped inside, slamming it behind me. The security locks went into effect, and the Hooded Guy was locked out.

He was staring at me, even though I couldn't see his eyes. I could feel them on me. We awkwardly stared at each other for about 30 seconds, before I jumped on the elevator and got the fuck out of there. 

But here I am, about 20 minutes later, still creeped out. I'm hoping it was just frat guys playing around, but I'm assuming it's homeless people. Around this time of year, the homeless really seem to loiter around campus more. I don't know why.

Also, to anyone that will soon be attending college: lanyards are not as bad as some will say; they certainly helped me a lot tonight! Thanks for reading!

**EDIT**: I was informed this morning (via email) from our resident coordinator (aka the ""chief"" of my dorm) that the guys were eventually picked up, and they were, in fact, homeless. Both intoxicated. This is both a relief and startling. There's no telling what they wanted from me or planned on doing, but as a frail hipster chick, my mind wanders... Eek. Thanks for your advice, guys! You're all wonderful! Mwah! :-)"	t5_2t3t8	True
1371766027.0	1gr8iq	Followed by a tailgater...to the middle of nowhere.	redletteryear	193	15	29	"Yesterday I had a moment that scared me pretty bad. 

I live in a town of about 11,000 in rural Wisconsin (not by preference, but for a job, we are moving when I get a better one). I was on my way to my employer's house (he runs the company out of his basement until we get new office space). I was being tailgated BAD by a ratty blue car and a white bald guy.

I drive a Kia Soul, which has a flat back end. So if I can't see your headlights, you are a mere few inches off my butt. And you will get me tapping my breaks. This guy did.

He honked at me. Whatever. I flipped him off and slowed down to five miles under the speed limit. There wasn't anyone behind him so I wasn't ruining anyone else's day. He had chances to pass me on the county road but didn't. After a few minutes with NO other cars around and him still kissing my bumper at 50 mph, I grabbed my cell phone and pretended to turn around quickly and take a picture of him. Then I pretended to call 911. I was in the country with no other cars around and this guy was getting creepy.

I came to my turn but decided to see if this guy would follow me. I turned left and he followed. Then I came to a roundabout and thought I would lose him. I traveled the entire thing around twice...he followed me. At this point I knew he was messing with me, trying to scare me. Well, I decided to let myself be late for my meeting. I began to drive to the police station. He followed me the whole way there.

I pulled up and parked, ready to run inside. I thought he would leave. Nope. He parked right next to me and just stared at me. And he pulled up on my side of the car, close enough that I would have had a hard time opening the door all the way.

He was in his 40's I'm guessing, wearing sunglasses, and a creepy smile. He was wearing fairly neat clothes, nothing scary there. The interior of the car was pristine (I was looking for a gun). I should mention here that I'm training to be a behavior analyst and while I work with kids right now, my hobby is criminal behavior and profiling. I was seriously trying to read this guy.

A few seconds went by and I grabbed my phone again. This time intent on calling 911 from the police station parking lot. As I dialed, he rolled his passenger window down, said nothing, rolled it back up, and took off. I went inside and told an officer what happened. Sadly I was too focused on not crashing to get a plate. Apparently there have been a lot of complaints about tail gaters recently, multiple with a blue car.

I filled out a report with the officer and they gave me a card for victim services and a local women's shelter (just in case he followed me home one night and I didn't feel safe, but I live in a secure building with my fiance). I went out to my car and there was a note on the windshield. All it had on it was a smiley face.

Serious horror-movie stuff. 

I took it back inside. The officer said he'd call me a few times during the night and I should avoid going anywhere alone for a while. He did call twice, and said he was patroling my parking lot during his night shift. This is a small town and the attitude around here is very communal, so I feel safe in that someone will back me up.

If I ever see this guy again, no question, I will call 911 and lead him straight to the police station again. I also told my fiance that I will post my work schedule or even when I have to leave for another reason and that if I don't text him within ten minutes of my estimated arrival time to call 911. Sheesh."	t5_2t3t8	True
1370447118.0	1fq67p	Weirdo client at my salon	read_vonnegut	202	27	40	"Once I was doing a haircut on a client who creeped me out so much I was tempted to just walk away halfway through. Looking back I should have told him he was making me uncomfortable but instead I just got quiet and kind of zoned out. 

So after he checked in &amp; we had a little chat about what he wanted I asked him to follow me to the shampoo area...he stood up and took off his shirt. I told him to put his shirt back on and tried not to laugh at him, during the shampoo he kept squirming around and putting his hands in his pockets so I cut it a little short.

Ok, so I am feeling sort of strange about him but was like ""whatever, do your job"". Then he starts checking out all of my coworkers, one walks past with crazy socks on and he was like ""I LIKE YOUR SOCKS A LOT"", she acted like she couldn't hear him and kept walking. I laughed a little and said ""looks like she got away"", he sighed and replied ""....guess so..."". THEN he starts telling me about all this money he has, he has 3 ex wives and 4 Lamborghinis, a mansion in the mountains and a house on the beach and a yacht he lives on sometimes. Just real bullshit but I acted like I was impressed. Then he told me he used to work at the pentagon, I was only half listening so I don't remember what lead up to this but all of a sudden I hear him talking about wombs. Talking about cutting open and seeing the inside of womens wombs and how they're the most beautiful shades of pink you'll ever see and they're so soft. .....What. I had no words, and he kept going on about it, I rushed through his haircut and told him he was done. I brought him up to the front desk where he started aggressively flirting with the receptionist for so long she finally she told him he had to leave because she had work to do. This was only like an hour before closing, usually we all leave when we're done but that day we all stuck around to walk down to our cars as a group (underground parking garage) which was a good thing because we saw him sitting in his car in the parking lot.

1366584829.0	1cts1t	Our handyman turned out to not be as friendly as we thought		211	37	24	"So ten years ago, our family moved into a three story house in the suburbs on Ontario, Canada. It was a beautiful structure with a hideous interior, and for that reason there were *a lot* of home improvement projects. My dad is a huge fan of these sorts of things, so he didn't mind and him and my mom hired a handyman, Angus Snow, to help with finishing our final project: The basement. It was a horrendously ugly little basement, but with the hard work my parents and Angus (and sometimes his lovely wife, Shirley) we got the job done.

About two, maybe three month after Angus helped us finish our basement, my dad was driving me home from a party held by our Girl Scout troop. During the ride, he had the radio turned on to the news. Me being ten, I wasn't paying much attention to what was being said until I felt the car jerk and swerve and my dad shout. He then pulled out his cell phone (some beautiful Nokia, I'm sure) and called my mom and told her to turn on the radio. 

I remember being very confused, but after he hung up he explained to me what he had just heard: Apparently, Angus beat Shirley to death earlier that day and was found on the vere of a near fatal drug overdose. I don't remember many details, but the rumor was that Angus was unstable, probably from drugs, and had cracked when Shirley got a new haircut. *I think* Angus did this in public parking lot of a mall, he beat her and then ran her over with his car. 

So, that's my story of the creepy encounter I had as a child with a murderer. 

TL;DR: Handyman beat his wife to death and ran her over with a car months after finishing our basement.

1358571382.0	16v12k	My Neighbor's Father	mylittlelamb	200	28	30	"When I was between the ages of 13 and 16 I lived across the street from a family that was very well known in our town. The family consisted of a very sweet mother, three bratty teenaged boys, and, most well known of all, their father. Their father was well known for being the kind of dad who buys their under-aged sons alcohol and makes sex jokes with their young, female friends, insisting they call him by his first name. He spoke in a smooth, almost high-pitched slow, southern voice. He was the older guy that you think is really laid back when you’re a kid, but when you grow up you realize he was just really creepy and inappropriate. I was closest in age to his youngest son, he being about a year and a half younger than me, and we became close friends. Everyone in town was a close friend, at some point, to at least one of those boys.

I’ve been openly bisexual since I was 13 years old, and their father had made it VERY clear that he was super “cool” with it, and would always give me little looks when I would be hanging out with a cute girl. He would say things like, “I know what you’re going to be doing tonight” with a little grin on his face. Sometimes, the comments would be a little overboard and uncomfortable (very vulgar things), but if you brought that kind of thing up with any of the sons, you were in trouble. They loved their dad, and they were the kind of guys who would fight you if you were a boy and ruin your social life if you were a girl just for speaking ill of their father.
When I was 15, I met a lesbian girl through mutual friends on myspace. She was 16, really cute and nice, and we got flirty but not intimately. She seemed like a really nice girl. After talking to her for about a week, we found out that she often hangs around in the neighborhood that was right next to mine. It was only about a 15 or 20 minute walk from my house, if I took a short cut through to woods, so we decided one day we would just meet up there. When that day came, I put on some make up and started my walk. As I was passing my neighborhood pool I heard a voice from behind me yelling “hey hoe!”. I turn around, and, of course, it’s the boys’ father in the pool parking lot, flagging me down. He called out, “hold on one minute,” got in his car and drove to me. He asked me where I was going, and I told him. He asked if I wanted a ride, and I turned him down. But he said it was no problem for him and he was headed to that neighborhood anyway to pick up one of his sons. So, reluctantly, I got into his car.

He asked me why I was going to this neighborhood, and I told him, shyly, about the girl I had met online. I could tell he was happy to hear that, in his sick, perverse way. He said to me, “I had a dream about you the other night.” I tried to be nonchalant, I asked him what it was about, knowing I didn’t want to hear it. He told me the premise of his dream in detail, though I can’t remember much of it, partly because that was 4 years ago and partly because I don’t really want to remember. But I do know he started with “The wife and the boys were out of the house, and you came over with a cute friend of yours…” it lead into this disgusting fantasy about us taking our clothes off and simultaneously giving him oral sex. In the midst of him telling me about this dream, he drove right past the entrance of the neighborhood. My stomach dropped. I was terrified, I thought for sure he was going to take me into some weird back woods and molest me. I spoke up through the frog in my throat and told that he had missed his turn. Luckily, he made a U-Turn and went back.

Once we got into the neighborhood he began questioning me about this girl, driving real slow around every turn. Asking me if I was going to have sex with her that night. Saying that if I did, I should tell him all the details. All I could do was nervously laugh, and say that I didn’t really know her at all. Every young girl we passed, he asked me about. First he asked if that was the girl I was meeting, then he’d ask if I would sleep with her regardless. One of the girls we passed looked to be about 12 years old. He said something objectifying and disturbing about her, once again asking my opinion. I told him she was too young for me, and definitely too young for him. I’ll never forget the way he looked at me when he said, “Age ain’t nothin’ but a number.” With such perverted lust.

Finally, he dropped me off at the playground where I met up with the girl I had intended on meeting up with, and I got into her car. We started making small talk as we were driving around. Things like, “do you know this or that person?”, “what do you do for fun?”, and the like. But the experience I had just had with my neighbor’s dad was really weighing heavy in my mind. Not to mention he was still texting me, asking if I liked her and if I was going to be with her physically. I had to tell her what had just happened. I told her everything he had said to me as she listened silently in disgust. Then, I looked in the rearview mirror and noticed that he had been following us from a distance. Not taking all the same roads (cause I had been nervously checking to make sure he had left), but he had found us again. When I told her, I could tell her was freaked out, and I was too. We drove to the gas station, trying to get away from him, but he followed us there too. We parked far away from each other, but he looked right into our car as he got out of his. The second he was inside the gas station, I asked her to take me home, and she gladly did. She told me to text her and let her know I was safe. Needless to say, after that day I never saw her again, and I don’t think we really talked much after that either.
The whole rest of the night, I received dirty, disgusting text messages from this man. And many phone calls that I ignored. He told me to call him and put him on speakerphone so he could hear us having sex. He said that he wouldn’t make a sound and that she’d never know he was listening. He said gut-wrenchingly vulgar things to me for hours. I sat there and cried even though he had never even touched me. I cried because of how overwhelming violated I felt, and also because I knew, in my naïve 15 year old brain, that I could not turn him into the cops. I couldn’t call the police because I was so close with his youngest son. I couldn’t send his father, whom he loved so dearly, to prison. That’s not what a “good friend” would do. So, I only ever told a handful of my friends. Almost all of the girls I told said, “he says dirty things to me too, and texts me all the time, but his son is one of my best friends, so I can’t really do anything about it.” I wish I could go back and shake my friends and myself and tell us that this man deserves to go to jail and we were the only ones that could make it happen, with the evidence we had, before he really hurt someone.

A few months ago, he sent me a message on facebook. This was first time we had really had a conversation since that day in his car (although I had seen him around since then). We talked for about 30 minutes on facebook chat, because I had told my roommates at the time the story of what had happened to me, and I wanted them to see this man in action. So, they read over my shoulder, saying that they themselves some how felt violated as well. Sure enough, he told me that he still thinks about me having sex with other girls. He went into detail. And I know when he thinks about it, in his mind, I’m still 15.

1356664151.0	15jxgx	My scariest night	Hwy280	218	40	22	"Sorry for the uncreative title but here's my story:

My husband and I lived in a tiny 1950's bungalow in a cute little town-the type of place where Main Street is gentrified with trendy restaurants and art galleries but surrounded by lower/working class homes. The area was pretty shady but we bought it in 2005 for what we thought was an absolute steal in the hopes the area would turn itself around (with the economic downturn, you can imagine how that worked out). We knew and liked all our immediate neighbors but just a street over in any direction were pretty rough areas. 

Anyway, we had lived there for nearly 5 years and felt pretty safe, even with a few iffy incidents. One night around 9 my husband headed to the gym with one of his friends and I went to the kitchen to make some popcorn before I settled in to watch TV. Through the curtain of the kitchen window (which was on the side of the house), I saw a car's headlights slow to a stop. I didn't think too much of it, as our street was pretty heavily trafficked. A few moments later I heard my dogs start barking and a loud knocking at the door. Thinking it was a neighbor, I went to the door and pulled back the blinds (the top half of the door was a window) and saw a man with a bandana covering his face, pointing a gun at me and screaming. I'm not sure if it was another language or if I was just too stunned to understand what he was saying, but I turned and ran with my dogs toward the back of the house as three gunshots fired behind me. My dogs and I ran into the backyard and I plastered myself against the house. On the other side of the fence, I see the car from before still sitting there. I jumped as two more gunshots fired into the backyard, then I heard a car door slam and watched the car peel off. 

My neighbors were all too scared to come out at first, but after I called out to them for a while they came and helped me over the fence (I did not want to go back in), called the cops, and got in touch with my husband at the gym. The police came and collected evidence and said there were footprints on my door, as if after he shot the assailant tried to kick in the door. They asked me flat out who would want to kill me and the answer is no one. My husband and I have never had enemies of any sort and the only thing they could figure was it was either some sort of gang initiation or case of the wrong location. Why they would shoot at a girl in her pajamas, I have no idea. One of the bullets lodged in the doorjamb of my living room right at my head level, if it had been a few inches to the right it would have hit me. Another bullet ricocheted into the dining room, which was the next room I ran through. 

We packed up that night and went to my parents house and I never spent another night there again. We found another place to live about 6 months later but we are stuck with this house that's now worth about half what we paid for it and the area is still pretty shitty. Nothing ever came of my investigation, it's a big county with a lot of crime and they have bigger fish to fry, but there was a large drug bust a couple of blocks away shortly thereafter and 13 people were arrested; I can only speculate that it could be related. I dealt with some pretty rough PTSD for about a year after but I live in a much safer place now and I'm just happy to be alive."	t5_2t3t8	True
1343671018.0	xeh0n	Prowler at the Window	Injunwerks	233	58	31	"Hey Guys! Been a lurker for the past few days and finally decided to share a story or two of my own. I have several, but I'll only post this one for now unless asked for more sooner. The community I mention in this story is responsible for maybe a dozen or so creepy/strange/weird stories; and we only lived there for about ten years...

In the mid 70s, my family lived near the Trinity River Plaza in the little community of Kenefick, Texas about 40 miles North East of Houston. We moved there because my parents were able to buy 5 acres of land at a really low price. My parents also bought a new single wide trailer house and moved it there in 1974 or 75. I was 6 or 7 at the time. 

I remember that house. It was my parents first home that they didn't rent. It only had one bathroom, but it had three bedrooms! After living in a two room apartment in Baytown, it was like moving into a majestic castle. It came fully furnished; beds, dressers, appliances, a living room set and a new color television. I can remember my mother doing a little dance in the kitchen because she had a ""real"" refrigerator and a dishwasher. It was set up on rail road ties and the wheels were removed and my dad put a lattice work curtain thingy all along the bottom to keep the animals from getting underneath. The week before this particular incident happened I cut a gash out of my side just above the hip from running around the front of the house and not remembering that the tongue of the trailer frame was sticking out about 5 feet. The little latch that secures the ball hitch into the receiver is what got me. We'd lived there about a year when this story takes place. 

We bought a section of land that was at the entrance of the road that went to the plaza. It was a dirt road and it followed our property line to a corner where the road made a 90 degree turn and followed our property line up to the state highway. About half a mile past the entrance to the plaza, the state highway came to a dead end. It was an isolated community. There was very little traffic there that wasn't a resident. 

You should know a little about the plaza or ""the bottom"" as it was called. The road into the bottom was the same dirt road that passed our house. That dirt road was one of my mom's biggest gripes; everyone drove too damn fast and the damn dusty, dirty air covered every damn thing in the damn house. This was our first house with an air conditioner and I guess she was afraid she'd wear it out because she usually left it off and opened the windows unless it was too hot. 

All of the houses in the bottom were built on stilts because the river flooded every year. The water from the river sometimes got as far as our yard, but it was rare. When the bottom flooded, the only way in or out was by boat. For about three weeks every summer, there'd be twenty or so cars parked on both sides of the road in front of our house and everybody would come and go in the boats. The cars were left unlocked and some had the keys in the ignition. I was warned by by my father on the threat of death and dismemberment to stay away from those cars. 

Another thing you should know about the bottom is that most of the people who lived there were unemployed or underemployed and mostly uneducated. Everyone down there hunted and fished. There was also a still or two and pot plants actually grew wild in places as well as in five gallon buckets on the occasional deck or elevated porch. The best way to politely describe the general population of the bottom is ""hillbilly."" Oh, and lots of guns lived there too. 

It was one of those communities where everyone knew everyone else and a newcomer was treated with suspicion for the first fifteen years they lived there. It was a community where if you got caught doing something wrong, it was as normal as not to get the snot slapped out of you and by the time you got home, they'd already called your parents and told why you'd been slapped. For me and my brother, that meant a whoopin' on top of the slap or chastising or whatever we got in the first place. All of us kids knew each other because we all rode the same bus to the same school. And since the bus couldn't navigate the rutted roads of the bottom on a good day, all of the kids waited for it in our front yard. My father eventually built a bench with a roof on it for everyone. 

On the night of this incident, my brother, me and my mother were all home alone. I was maybe 6 and my brother would have been 4. We were in the middle of a big south Texas thunder-boomer storm. Lightning was flashing everywhere. The accompanying thunder would literally rattle the entire house. The rain hitting the metal roof of the trailer made a steady dull roar inside the house. You had to talk louder than normal just to be heard. My mother was busy getting candles and matches ready because such a storm normally knocked out the power for at least two hours and usually four or five. My father worked shift-work at a steel mill about 35 miles away and wasn't due home for another hour or so. 

This was in a time before Atari and Nintendo and CDs and DVDs and VCRs. We had an aerial antenna that pulled in a grand total of three channels that were clear on only the best of days. My brother and I were standing at one of the lower windows watching the lightning strike. 

I was watching a car come up the road from the bottom. The dirt road was loose gravel over compacted clay and it got slick in places when it rained. About once every three months, someone would come home drunk or high and try to take that 90 degree turn too fast and would wind up in the ditch. In the first year that we lived there, I must have seen the bottoms of five or six cars and trucks. They would get sideways in the turn and hit the ditch and roll over. It was always good fun to watch the tow truck roll them back over and haul them off. Sometimes I could sneak up to the fence on our property and watch everything from a front row seat through the barbed wire. Then; after the car or truck had been hauled off, I'd go and look for change that had fallen out of the car. I even found a box of bullets once. I got a spankin' for bringing it home. 

Anyways, I'm watching this car come up the road from the bottom, but I can tell he's being safe and not driving too fast. Just as I made this realization, my brother screamed bloody murder in my ear. He was screaming so hard that his body locked up and he lost his voice and just made a rasping noise. When he screamed, it scared me and I screamed. My mother came running from the kitchen, her bathrobe spreading open like Batman's cape. She grabbed my brother who was still trying to scream and asked him was happened. At the same time she was scooping him up with one arm, she was pushing me away from the window with the other. When she pushed me, she accidentally hit my bandages from my encounter with the tongue of the trailer. It hurt and I started crying too. So now we're all three on the couch. Mom is doing her best to comfort the both of us. I am OK after a few minutes, but my brother is still hysterical. He had the hiccups and was trying to tell her what he'd seen. He could only say ""boodah"" which was his word for monster or booger. As it turns out, someones cows had gotten out and there was a big bull in our yard. 

As my mother held my brother and was at the window showing him that it was only a big cow, she suddenly stiffened and backed away from the window. She put my brother down and went to the phone. She picked up the phone and started to dial. We were on a party line with two other families; an elderly couple who were seldom on the phone and a family with a teenage girl who was seldom off the phone. I could hear my mother whispering into the phone, I guess she was trying not to scare us, but she was so scared herself that I could hear I could hear it all. 

""Debra, get off the phone, I need to call the police."" 

""Yes, the police. Will you please hang up so I can call.""

""I have an emergency, that's why.""

""Debra, will you please just hang.....""

Finally my mother was able to call the police. She told them that she was looking out the window to show my brother that it was only a cow in the yard when the lightning struck and she could see a man in the tree in our yard. 

""Yes!!! He's in the tree, watching the house. Please hurry""

""No, the doors are all locked and I have several pistols.""

""Turn out the lights? Are you crazy?""

""Oh.... OK, that makes sense.""

She gave them directions to our house and hung up. Before she turned around, the phone rang it's little three ring jingle that was assigned to us. It was Debra's father calling to see if everything was OK. My mother told him everything as she was running around carrying my brother and trying to turn off all the lights. She snapped her fingers at me and gestured at me to turn off the television. 

Mister Trachalek said he'd come over and stay until dad got home. He said that he would be there in about five minutes. Mom hung up the phone and told me to get come into the den with her. There weren't any windows in the den. 

We went into the den and could hear the rain coming down harder than ever when we got still. She put my brother onto the sofa beside me and went to the bedroom to get one of my dads pistols. The ammunition was kept in the cabinet above the kitchen sink, probably to keep me and my brother from getting into it. The problem was that she'd turned off all of the lights and my father had eight or ten different pistols and she couldn't find the ammunition for the pistol she had. 

In frustration, she pulled the cord of the light that was mounted under the cabinet to turn it on and was trying to read the boxes. Her hands were shaking so badly that she had to set the box on the counter and bend over to read the type of ammunition she had. She would get a box and set in on the counter top holding it with both hands and then get another. She was on the fourth or fifth box when she looked out the window above the sink and promptly lost her cool. 

The man was outside the kitchen window looking in at her. His face was less than two feet from hers. I remember her stumbling back into the table where she'd left the pistol. She grabbed it and pointed it at the window and just started pulling the trigger. Luckily it was empty because it was at this time that Mr. Trachalek started banging on the door. My mother spun towards the door and pulled the trigger some more. Then she heard Mr. Trachalek calling her name and unlocked the door for him. He stepped in out of the rain with a shotgun as big as him (he was a little dark skinned man) and asked what was going on. She was hysterical. She tried to talk calmly but ended up screaming anyways. 

""He's in the back yard! He was looking through the window at me!""

As she said this, she was pointing with the pistol at the window over the sink. Mr. Trachalek didn't say anything, he just turned around and ran back out into the rain. After a few seconds, we heard him shouting and then 'boom.' Silence and then 'boom.' and then silence again. 

By this time, my mother was holding me and my brother at her side like an old mother hen but she was shaking so hard that we had to sit on the sofa. After what seemed like hours, someone knocked on the door again and called my mother's name. It was Mr. Trachalek. He was completely soaked and the first thing he did was apologize for getting the floors wet. 

""Son of gun shot at me!"" He said it like he was surprised and had his feelings hurt. The held up a hand with two fingers spread apart like a peace symbol and said ""Twicet"" with a ""t"" on the end of it. ""I can't believe he shot at me!""

My mother got him a towel and he told her how the man had pulled out a pistol and shot at him as he came around the corner of the house. He told my mother that the man shot once and then ran and jumped over the chain link fence and then shot again before running down toward the bottom. Then he said that the man was the tallest man he'd ever seen in his life. ""Flat footed jumped that dern fence, didn't even break stride."" 

He said that he'd wait with us until dad got home. My mom was making coffee when the sheriff stopped outside with his lights on. He'd just trotted up to the door when my father pulled into the yard. They all started talking and were still talking when I got sleepy and fell asleep on the sofa. 

The next day, the sheriff came back to see if he could find anything. He was hoping to find a bullet lodged in a tree or something, but he couldn't find anything. 

The one thing that I do remember that gives me chills to this day was the sheriff standing outside our trailer house under the window that was over the kitchen sink; the window where my mom encountered the prowler. The sheriff was talking to Mr Trachalek and had asked him to go over everything step by step for the third or fourth time. The sheriff wanted to confirm that the prowler was standing under this particular window; pointing up to the kitchen window; a good foot and a half above his head. 

""What was he standing on?"" The sheriff was looking around for a stack of bricks or something. Mr Trachalek said that he wasn't standing on anything. ""He was just standing there with his hands behind his back looking into that window when I came around the corner. He just turned and looked at me and pulled out a little pistol and shot at me, then he ran over to the fence and jumped over it like it was only a foot tall and then started running to the bottom. As he was running, he pointed the pistol behind him without looking and shot at me again."" (he said this like it still hurt his feelings)

The sheriff was stuck on thinking about the window and asked again if this was the correct window. When they measured the window, the bottom edge of the frame was over 8 feet from the ground. That meant that for him to be looking inside at my mother, he would have had to have been at least 8'6"". 

We lived there for several years after that and even though that was only one creepy night of several, we never saw him again nor did anyone from the bottom. I still get goosebumps whenever I stop and think about that night. Remind me to tell you about the bloodied lady who barged into our house one night... Strange but True!"	t5_2t3t8	True

Anyways, I live in Nebraska and I currently do a job called detasseling. But detasseling is too long to go into and explain what it is so I'm just going to cut straight to the story. Anyways, I have to get up at 4 A.M. every day for about 3-4 weeks. I have to drive to a parking lot at a high school where a bus picks us up at about 5:15 and takes us out to the fields which are usually about an hour away.

One thing that I thought was just a little bit weird is that when I got in my car and drove out of my garage, there was a jeep parked outside of my neighbors house that I've never seen before with somebody sitting in the driver seat. I didn't think anything of it like every other person who gets attacked on LetsNotMeet and just passed it off as somebody falling asleep in his car. However, when I started to drive off, I saw this cars headlights turn on. When I got onto the interstate and started driving to the high school, I saw the person following behind me.

I still decided not to do anything about it and when I got into the parking lot, the person drove around me and parked about 20 meters away. It's my eight year detasseling and I'm friends with a group of about 3 or 4 other experienced people that used to play football and baseball for high school so they're pretty buff and don't take a lot of shit. There were about 12 more people that were only 2nd and 3rd years and noticed that most of them were all under 5""11. 

It was about 5:00 and the lights still haven't turned on in the parking lot and that's when things started to turn shitty. The guy who followed me from my house got out of his car and started his way in our direction wearing a black jacket that covered his face . We were all in one big group and I noticed immediately when he got out of his car. This is when I started to feel my adrenaline pumped through my entire body. The man in the jacket starting running towards us and grabbed the smallest kid in our group. When he started running off with him. Me and two of my football defensive lineman friends bolted off of our coolers and HAULED ASS towards him. We all tackled him at the same time and threw his ass to the ground with a force of up to about 600 pounds. We held him down and called the police and later found out that he was on the loose for 3 weeks. Damn did I feel like a hero after that

TL;DR - Me and my friends tackled a child molester and I felt like a badass.

EDIT: The leader of the detasseling group is giving me and my friends a 500 dollar bonus at the end of the season."	t5_2t3t8	True
1342612316.0	wr6yz	I manged to lose the men who trailed my car from the airport	galletto3	194	23	32	"My story starts of pretty mundanely. I owed my good friend a favor back in high school, so he asked me to pick up him and his mother and little brother from the airport and drive them to their new house one weekend. They had been out of the country for several months and were in the process of moving again, so they rented this POS house in the middle of a really bad neighborhood, which i suppose was just served as a place to store their crap.

Well I wait at the airport for them as their flight gets delayed...for over 3 hours. Around the time they land and we pack up their bags, its almost 4 am. Im exhausted, but I have to drive them to their house 45 min away, then travel another hour back home. I mentally braced myself for a long trip and drink a Red bull to give me a jolt of energy.

As Im pulling out of the airport parking lot, a small dark blue car pulls behind us. No big deal, I barely noticed it, and it stayed a ways behind. However i notice after ive made several wrong turns (none of us had GPS and they were giving me directions from memory) and corrected my course, that this car is still cruising, slowly but surely, behind us.

I think to myself its a weird coincidence but took a mental note of it. Eventually we get closer to their neighborhood, and thus closer to a really bad part of town. We pull up to a red light and I check my rear view mirror. 

Two men. One had a bigger silhouette and the other kept shaking his head like he was trying to get a crick out of his neck. Now they have my full attention; why the hell are they still behind me? For some strange reason im hoping that this is just a stupid coincidence and my sleep deprived brain is causing me to become paranoid. 

Until they follow us into the neighborhood. ""NO FUCKING WAY"" I say loudly enough to wake my sleeping passengers. I fill them in and they shrug it off, but Im not taking any chances. ""Hold on to your butts"" I tell them.

We pull up to a stop sign and I suddenly gun my SUV. I begin whipping around turns, and sure enough they are trying to keep up. I quickly and repeatedly change streets trying to evade them. Another oncoming car causes them to slam their brakes behind me, allowing me to pull ahead and lose sight of them. Once that happens I take a few more turns to lose them (it was a big neighborhood) and pull into a random driveway and kill the engine. 

A minute later the car comes roaring down the street. The whole family is on edge now telling me to just head home. I tell them to give me it second. The car come roaring back down the street, faster than before. I waited until i couldnt see their lights or hear their engine before i turned mine back on and continued to our destination. Many pats on my back from the family.

We eventually got to their house and brought all their bags in with no hassle. They were dead tired, but i decided to stay up and watch the house until it was light to make sure that those guys hadnt somehow found my car again (or something). 

I left around 8, ready to be back in my bed to sleep. I dont owe my friend anymore favors.

1333095596.0	rknye	[My] messed up Valentine's Day	1nf1del	198	22	30	"When I was in high school I lived in a really small town in Texas. It was the kind of place where everyone was either related to each other or hated each other. I had no family there, so yeah. But I did have a pretty, blonde girlfriend and was pretty hated for that too. Nothing major, just petty harassment, occasional fights, but it had been escalating. 

So, that's why, on Valentine's Day, my girlfriend and I decided to skip the school dance and just stay in and watch a movie at her house while her parents went out. Just better to avoid trouble. We borrowed her dad's car, a little Honda hatchback, and went into town. We stopped at the video store for a movie and went to the Dairy Queen for some ice cream and then headed home. Now, she lives in the complete boonies - out in the middle of the woods along a lonely road with no streetlights.  We're chatting, eating our Blizzards when all of a sudden a car comes up behind us. No big deal.

What was a **very** big deal was that when the headlights flooded the interior of our car I saw two hands on the backseat and a head coming from the hatchback part of the car.  As soon as the lights hit, the head and hands retreated back down. A solid chill ran through the entire length of my body. I slowly reached down and pulled out my pocket knife (only thing I had). She saw me and asked what was wrong. Loudly I said, ""Nothing, I just have to stop at my friend's house real quick."" She knew that was bullshit, I didn't have any friends!

I pulled over at the next house that came up and jumped out of the car yelling at her to jump out too. She jumped out in total confusion, I flipped the driver's seat forward and lunged into the backseat in full maniac mode.

He popped up like a jack-in-the-box with empty hands waving, ""HEY HEY HEY! Hey, uh. What y'all up to tonight??"" 

It was some weird kid from our high school who we had never in our entire lives spoken to before. Ever.  I said, ""What the holy fuck are you doing in our car?!!"" His reply was, ""I thought you guys were goin' to the dance and I was just hitching a ride."" 

We sat there staring at him with our mouths open wondering what to do. He tried to act real cool and obviously we were in the middle of nowhere in some random person's driveway, so whatever he was planning was forgotten. We actually ended up driving him to the dance and dropping him off. The whole time he's telling us to come inside with him. Yeah, no. We dropped his ass off and noped out of there as soon as we could. As soon as he got out of the car my girlfriend started crying and shaking, she was so freaked out. 

I have no idea what he was trying to do when the lights caught him crawling out of the hatchback. 

I fucking hated that high school...

1365919235.0	1cbaxs	Scariest moment in my life...	RodBlake	204	27	12	"  This is something that happened to me about two years ago, but thinking about it still gives me chills...

  I used to live in a small town in rural Missouri with my Mother and Step Father. Our house was a few miles outside of town and along an old state highway. We were pretty isolated out there, other than the occasional passing car or farm equipment. One day i came home from a morning shift at work. I was pretty tired, so I immediately came in the front door and sprawled out on the couch. My Mother and Step Father were preparing to go into town to visit a family friend, So I just started a movie and quickly drifted off to sleep. I remember waking up to the sound of my parents leaving. After that, I slept rather soundly. 
  I must have been asleep for a couple of hours before I was woken up to the sound of the front door opening and closing. I laid silently, hoping to fall back asleep. I assumed it was just my parents returning from their visit. After a moment of silence, I heard an unfamiliar voice say, ""Where is everybody?"". My eyes shot open and i looked up to see a man standing over me. I had never seen this man before. He was tall and muscular. He was wearing a white t-shirt with cut off sleeves. He was also covered head to toe in blood. I jumped to my feet instantly. I had never been so scared in my life. Trying to rationalize, I asked, ""Are you looking for my parents?"". He stared at me for a moment and asked who I was. I replied by asking ""Who are YOU, and what the fuck are you doing in my house?"". He stared at me blankly. I thought I was going to be murdered. He kept talking incoherently and asking where everyone was. at this point, I had no idea who he was referring to.
  After about five minutes of nearly crippling fear, i realized that the blood that was all over his clothes and face was his own. I glanced out the living room window toward the highway. And then I started to understand. In the drainage ditch in front of my house was a red pickup truck. I told the man to come with me and we went outside. soon after we got near the truck another vehicle pulled up. Apparently the man had been drunk driving and had driven his truck into the ditch. He was drunk and had a concussion from the wreck. He was so messed up that he had thought other people were in the truck with him before the wreck when in fact, he had been alone. He had stumbled into the nearest house looking for help. The driver that had just pulled up, drove the man to the hospital and as far as i know he was okay. 
  Though i understand the situation now, i will never forget this. It was fucking terrifying.

1358831811.0	171f9t	Let off with a warning...?	LunarTears	203	29	36	"Awhile back, when I lived in a small town with long, winding stretches of road between my house and my workplace, I had a rather unsettling run in with a police officer.

I worked the night shift, so it was about 11 p.m. (and a Saturday, as evidenced by all the motorists weaving about) when I set out towards the hotel I worked at. I have a GPS system that logs a nigh-uncomfortable amount of information, so I know that I wasn't speeding. After driving for about a mile, I notice a car starts following me very closely. After a couple of miles of this, I've decided I've had enough so I switch lanes in front of a few other cars and keep driving. Predictably, this person (it was too dark to see anything but their headlights, as there were few streetlights in this remote area) weaves in and out of cars to get back behind me. 

Finally, after being tailgated for about 13 miles, I get to a lone stretch of road and the speed limit increases to 55 mph. I gladly take the opportunity to go faster once I pass the sign, and admittedly I did get up to 57 mph as this person continued to tail me. 

And he turns his lights on. I'm already nervous, as the road is dark and it's late but there are just enough cars going by for me to reason with myself to pull over. And then the cop turns his lights off, which I'm quite certain they're not supposed to do. 

He approaches my window and chides me for speeding, saying he saw me going 70 mph in a 30 mph zone on the street he initially started following me on.I tell him my GPS log can say otherwise, and I bluffed a bit (stupid, I know) saying that I had a device from my insurance company that also tracks my driving. He claims he saw me weaving 'all over the road', and assumed I was drunk and I question why, if I was speeding so seriously and driving so poorly, he followed me for 13 miles--passing said obvious drunk drivers and people speeding past us to do so--instead of pulling me over immediately.

Ignoring my question, the cop glances down and says my car is going to cause the grass I'm parked on to catch fire (???) and asks me to pull into an empty lot on top of a nearby hill--a lot that was completely impossible to see from the road. Nervous, I act as if I am going to and 'accidentally' pass it only to pull into a residential parking lot with all the lights on.

The cop gets out, obviously angry and demands to see my license and registration. I turned it in, and he gets in his car  for just a few moments, during which I quite obviously get my phone out and tell my coworkers what's going on.  He then gets out of the car, returns my information claiming he let me off with a warning, and drives off quickly. 

He returned my registration, but kept my license, and the slip had a bunch of scribbles on it in place of any real words. The next day, I called the station looking for my license and of course he hadn't turned it in. I told them what had happened and gave them some information that they asked for (including some numbers on the ticket) and they said they'd look into it.

The next few days I did see a cop car on the roads near my house, but I wrote it off as noticing something normal out of paranoia. My father thought I was being ridiculous, which upset me quite a bit as I still had (and have) that 'fake' ticket. Luckily, I'd been planning a move and moved out of state just a week or so later, but I hope that my complaint was looked into and that man didn't do anything wrong to anyone. "	t5_2t3t8	True

When my friend was really little -- about 3 or 4 -- he inexplicably woke up in the middle of the night (he doesn't remember how or why). My friend's parents are divorced, so at the time the house was only himself and his mother living there.

The house was relatively small, and in his downstairs there was a sliding glass door that opened into his backyard. Upon being awake, my friend wandered downstairs where he, to his chilling surprise, saw a man standing on the other side of the glass.

The two of them locked eyes, and the man silently attempted to coax my friend into unlocking the door. 

Being the young age he was, my friend wandered up to the door and, not knowing any better, placed his hand onto the lock about to open the door up.

Before turning the latch, something immediately clicked and he suddenly realized how terrible the situation was. A moment of shock and a chill down his spine he took off in the other direction, ran back upstairs, and I believe hid frightened in his bed. 

He says that the memory still always haunts him. "	t5_2t3t8	True

We had sued a major corporation because one of their waste treatment facilities was leaking untreated waste into a stream. That stream went throughout the entire neighborhood, but our house was the first downstream. We had a lot of threats over the few years we were involved. People would call us and make threats. Sometimes there would be menacing notes written on our windows in soap.
We always thought it was aimed at my parents. Like, maybe someone was trying to scare them so they would drop the case. I never thought it would involve me. 

But, my photos were in the paper a few times.
We had a few weird events where we thought someone was standing by the living room window, watching us (saw the shadow). We called the police but they never found anything. Our backyard met the creek, and then the other bank of the creek was a steep hill.
I remember seeing a weird red light glowing in the woods one night. I walked out there with my friends one night, and found a duck blind. One of those things hunters use, you know? Made of sticks and tied with panty hose. Several beer caps, cigarette butts, and some empty film packaging. The spot was right across from our house.
One day, we came home from dinner and our front door was open. My parents told me to wait on the porch, but I could hear music playing. Nothing was missing, but someone had been inside and had started playing an album. There was a voicemail on the machine.
My parents never let me hear it, but apparently it was for me. The album that we walked in on was playing in the background.

Setting-Montmartre, France

So I will preface this by saying that I've been to France twice and both times I was hit on relentlessly by middle eastern men who live there. They are usually very forward but never make any attempt to harm you and will go away when they notice you aren't alone or that you are firm in telling them to buzz off. 

Anyways, when I was a junior in high school I went on a school funded trip to Paris. One of the days we were there we visited Montmartre, the art district of Paris. Truly a wonder and a great thing to see, definitely. However, it is very close to the red light district and so it's best to go there during the day. A Parisian man told me himself he'd never go there at night. So my tour group goes there in the afternoon to visit. There are a lot of stairs to get up to the area and a lift if you don't want to walk. My friend Ashley had sprained her ankle before the trip and so she wanted a ticket to the lift. We tried to buy them but the middle eastern man at the booth adamantly refused to sell me a ticket until I gave him ""a french kiss."" I refused and kept trying to buy a ticket but he was stern on not giving me one. We decided to just walk up the stairs because I was tired of the looks he kept shooting towards my chest. 

So we visit Montmarte and it's lovely just as we expected. The group all gathers and we leave to go to the next place we were scheduled to be at for dinner. The group is walking quite a ways ahead of us but they're all clearly visible and it's not yet nighttime. Ashley and another friend of ours and I are all walking, taking our time. Suddenly, an old crusty middle eastern man pops up out of nowhere in front of us, blocking the way. He tells Ashley that she's very beautiful and that he wants her. We say nothing and keep walking but he follows, he keeps showing up in front of us, like he can fucking teleport or something. At this point we're panicking, though technically we aren't in too much danger. We're just far from our group and afraid we won't catch up to them and be lost. He is absolutely relentless in following us, with this disgusting yellow-toothed grin plastered to his face. Finally he reaches out and grabs Ashley's hair, tugging her towards him. She screams and all three of us break out in a dead run. 

At this point one of the chaperones see's what's happening. She also freaks out and starts yelling ""STAY AWAY FROM MY GIRLS!"" Getting all crazy mama bear on him. He doesn't care and continues to chase us, also running now. We all eventually run into the main street and he disappears as if he were never there.

Oddly enough we were punished for ""making a scene."" "	t5_2t3t8	True
1344869336.0	y59rs	Someone knew our number.	NavywifeJP	215	37	33	"Hi! This is my first post on any Reddit, and I thought I'd give my two cents. Please be gentle! :)

These (maybe connected) stories happened when I was 13-17.

The first was a four year experience of ""Unknown Number"" caller(s) who would call my sister's cell phone I shared with her and then hang up. Often, it would be silence, or very low breathing. It would happen all the time during the day but never at night, which made my mother think it was a prank from one of my school mates. But what changed was when I was 16-ish. I was with my friend ""Terry"" when we got one of those calls. It had to be around 7 or 8 at night and I was sick of the crap.

I picked up the phone and put this person on a group call. My sister, ""Lexi"", Terry and I all screamed obscene words at this unknown person and told him to stop calling. Immediately after we hung up, he called back. We put him to voicemail. He called again. He called 5 more times before we decided to do something. Terry called the police using her phone as I checked the voicemails. They were all some unrecognizable guy and girl, laughing and saying our names. They sounded like adults, but were completely incoherent and hysterical. One minute, they were angry, the next laughing. It creeped us the hell out. The police said they couldn't trace the call, and when we asked Verizon to, they said it wasn't possible (this was mid-2000s). 

Eventually, they stopped calling. But as soon as they stopped, another form of harassment started. Lexi and I were walking home from high school, like any normal day, when we walked up to three police cars, lights flashing, parked in our driveway. We caught two men with guns out sneak through our first floor garage. Not knowing what else to do, we followed them, opening the door inside the garage to see them walk up our stairs. My mom's boyfriend ""Ray"" had left it open to mow the lawn in the backyard, which he was doing at the time. He didn't hear or see the police roll up.

""What the &amp;*^% are you doing?"" Lexi asked. One of the police officers turned to us with the gun pointing downwards. She looked angry from what I remembered, and called to the others in the house. She lead us outside and asked if one of us was ""Lexi"". My sister nodded, freaked out and shaking. The police officer asked if she made the call to 911. We pointed out that we'd just come home from school. The other police officer confirmed that with my mother, who was standing like a stone in the kitchen.

Apparently, someone had made a call, saying they were my sister, that there was someone in the house with a gun trying to kill her. I was suspicious of my sister at first, since we did have a cell phone and it sounded like something her stupid friends would have done as a prank. But the police officer confirmed that the call was made from inside the house, using our home phone. 

This happened once more later that year, around the same time. That time nobody was home, and they waited until Lexi and I arrived back to confirm what happened. The second time, the police were much more understanding and were actually worried for our safety. Nothing came out of it, and my mother still lives at home safe and sound. Though to this day, we still have no idea what went on or why someone would do that or even how. Anyway, thanks for reading!

The second half of this story just gets fucked weird. And the third part is even worse. It was one of those nights that made me question whether paranormal was possible; because for this much to go wrong in the space of ~9 hours makes no fucking sense to me. But you asked for it. Here it is, unadulterated.

In Alexandria it made sense that shit went wrong; I just so did not fit in there, especially at night. But I guess I'm gonna keep going, and I'll fill you guys in on what was unquestionably the scariest/weirdest/at times interesting night of my life. The worst part is it didn't stop until I got home, and getting home took me a long ass time.

So I start my car up, and by this point I'm so freaked out that my leg is shaking on the clutch when I pull off. I also expect my car is going to overheat pretty soon unless I manage to find a petrol station and get some water put into my tank, so at no point do I get to calm down in any of this. On the bright side I was pretty sure I was headed in the right direction. I could see the highway coming into view. Now, y'know how when horses are close to home they start going really fast? I did that. I actually had a pretty good reasoning at the time; my car cools down when I drive it faster. So I sped up. And I hit a massive ditch in the road. Car made it out, thank god, but on top of heating problems I really didn't want to have to go and look, and the road ahead of me was still dark as fuck. But I heard the front of my car hitting the road and I'm worried about damage so with a ""fuck my life"" I step out the car to check it out.

The bumper was a little messed up, but nothing too bad. I realize I keep going back and adding context, but this is also important to note: up until I turned 20, I had the worst luck with cars. Breaking down was part of a Saturday night for me, so I wasn't entirely useless at evaluating/fixing things that went wrong, and so far, from what I could tell, there wasn't anything notably wrong with my car other than some exterior damage. I scout the area a bit and it all looks safe, so I head back to my car and open the door. Then I get one of them ""AAAAH"" type of frights when I hear screaming off in the distance. It felt like Sin City only in a more rural, scary ass area. If God exists, I swear he was toying with me because like a god damned horror movie, I hear the screams of a woman, followed by a dog barking, then a baby crying, and an angry man.

But I hop back in and I drive on. Because of the left turn I took earlier I knew I was supposed to pull a little left-right to get back onto the main road that got me into all this, and then I could just play it safe, get to a gas station, and back on the highway. But going straight, parallel to the main road, took me to a dead end. So imagine that between all the shitty houses and the barely tarred roads, this white cement barrier blocking the road off, and about 6 or 7 dudes with a fire sitting on top of it, chilling, drinking beers, and eating...fucking deer. I don't know if it was the same guy from earlier. Might have been. Might not have been. Overall, a lot of the incidents of this evening I try to put down to stupid ass coincidence.

Anyways, I catch them in my headlights and keep calm, 'cause all I have to do is turn around and get back onto the main road. They're eyeing me out, I wouldn't even say in a bad way, they're just looking at me, and having been given enough reason to shit myself that night, this only made it worse, 'cause at the time I was pretty sure they wanted to rape me. I pull the turn around motion and speed off. And I really hated my life at that moment because there went the heat gauge. I was used to that; usually if my car derped out, I'd have to go for a few minutes, stop for a few minutes to get it anywhere, that wasn't abnormal. But on this particular day I just wanted to fucking get home and my car was not having it. I run it through red line for a little bit just to try and distance myself from...people.

 Anyways, so I figure, I'm in the clear. I just let my car overheat for a while and hope I don't get murdered. Open the trunk, open the bleeder (it's a little screw by the water tanks of BMWs that lets the pressure out) and step back in while I wait. In my rearview I see the dudes all walking towards me. I don't immediately assume the worst. I obviously grant credit to the possibility that they are sinister, but it seems about as likely that they just want to help. I don't fucking know. But they come up to me.

 

You'll have to understand that by this point I've had the worst night ever and I just feel utterly apathetic. Like I'm done trying. If you're scared for long enough you tend to just embrace it, like a steaming pile of shit that's been in your living room for years and it's so stuck to the carpet that you just learn to get along with watching TV, nostrils full of shit and all.

 

So they come up and I give a half hearted ""Hi."" They're pretty cool. ""Howzit, what's up with your car?"" I give them the story and they tell me Alexandria is pretty dangerous and that they'll stick with me until I'm ready to go. They offer for me to go to the fire with them but I decline because holy shit no. I can't say I got a bad vibe from them though. All in all they seemed pretty nice and they wanted to make sure I was safe, so we did some talking, smoked some cigarettes (most of them were just getting blazed Snoop Lion style).

 

From the other end of the road, the way I came down that led me to the dead end, another group of dudes are walking up. It must be 12, 12:30AM by this point and I can't fathom why anyone would be walking around so late, but whatever. I'm gonna call them group 2 for reference and the first group group 1. I'm not very creative. Anyways. I understand the language somewhat (not well enough to speak much, but I can understand it enough to make out what happened). Here's how the conversation runs after pleasantries:

 

Group 2:  What's up with the whitey? (Turns and says hi to me in English)

 

Group 1: Car broke down, something something white people and car problems

 

Group 2: Something something car something can take it

 

Group 1: Nah he's a brother (something along these lines, my translation wasn't spot on)

 

Group 2:That boy? There's no way he's a brother

 

Group 1: (skipping some in between talk here) What do you want to do?

 

Group 2: Freak him out and take his car, something something gun

 

I've kind of had enough of this. Group 1 was nice enough to stand up for me, but I'm not really the kind of guy who lets things go by, and sometimes I really wish I was, because it might keep me out of trouble, but in this case I think I did the right thing.

 

So I tap one of the guys next to me, a guy from 'my' group and say 'Did he say he wants to see my gun?'

 

He looks at me and says 'You have a gun?'

 

I motion for him to keep it down and I tell him I've got it in the car if we need to use it. He taps his buddy on the shoulder and whispers something. He tells Group 2 that I've got a gun (I don't), and that they should lay off, it's not going to go well. Group 2 kind of grunts and keeps walking, a few of them trying to shake my hand as they do, but fuck that. I was a little too cocky in eying them down though; to me it made sense. They were just conspiring to rob me, then smile and wave as they walk past.

 

But the last guy stops and says ""What, you don't want to shake my hand?""

 

So I look around a bit and figure out what I'm gonna say. ""I speak Zulu.""

 

They all bust out laughing and group 2 asks what I heard. I tell them, succinctly, and they laugh a little more. The dude who was just fronting on me laughs, pats me on the back and says ""Ah, alright brother"" and they head off.

 

One of the guys from Group 1 was nice enough to get me some water for the car, and they helped me fill up and gave me some directions to where I'm going. Fuck yeah. I say my thanks and goodbyes and drive off after a little while of making sure everything was sorted. I'm pretty confident now. My car won't overheat if I've done the water properly, so I should be fine, and I finally know where I'm going and it's super fucking simple.

 

I make it out of Alexandria, and the story continues after that, but I guess you guys wanted the full story, so here's what I saw on the way out.  Two things of note. And I still have a hard time believing that I could have so much fucked up shit happen in one night, but then again, I'm not really a patron of Alexandria, and my friends have told me some fucked up stories about life in the townships, particularly late at night.

 

First thing is easier to talk about. I come up to a T-Junction, just like my friendly protectors said I would, but while my lights are shining down, I see something kind of weird. Something moving. Not exactly in line with my lights, but between two houses just off to the side, and there's a pretty small crack between them. So I squint and look really close and--no--what the--yep. That's a man sucking another man's dick. So that's something I never wanted to see in person. Or on video. But fine. The image lingered around for a bit but it wasn't frightening or anything.

 

But the next thing was pretty fucking terrifying. There was a little clearing, which is weird, because Alexandria is like Tokyo-building density, but there was this random spot of soil where a full on bon fire was going. Describing this is kind of tricky, because I'd never seen it before, I haven't seen it since and I know fuck all about it, and I'm sure it's not just a ""normal"" part of South African culture, but there were people singing and dancing while they made their way around the fire, and a few of them screaming. But there was a dude on the floor (might have been a woman, couldn't really see), screaming his ass off, legs spread open, facing out, up, with a white tribal mask on. Screaming. And screaming. Right in front of the fire, while everyone dancer around him.

 

Fuck. Me. About 6 blocks and I was out of Alexandria. I looped straight onto the road to Linboro Park and came to a stop at the intersection. Now I was really freaked out while I was there because the guy I was going to visit got jacked at the same spot not too long ago. Light turns green and I'm in the clear. Then I remember something. I don't have a fucking phone.

 

I make it to my friend's house and I'm outside. The house itself isn't that big, but the plot is pretty massive -- I'd say a kilometer (half a mile or so) around, and the house is right at the fucking back, and the only way is either to call him on his phone or call loud enough that someone in the house wakes up.

 

So I'm standing out calling to him and not a fucking peep. It's dead quiet, I'm worried about waking the neighbors, his parents, or anyone, and I'm just in a fucking terrible mood by this point. In retrospect, I don't really know why I didn't just go home right then, but I think it had something to do with just feeling like I'd been through so much. Little did I know I was in for even more. Writing this now I realize I've never told anyone this full story. Just bits. But holy shit did this night get creepy.

 

I drove to a nearby gas station -- I say nearby, it was out of the neighborhood, over a bridge and into the city that you'd expect half way between Alexandria and rich white folk with their Equestrian Estates and shit. It was a Friday night and I wasn't done just yet. I told the guy at the gas station about the heating trouble and said I just wanna leave it for a while and check on it later. I head inside, buy some more cigarettes and some Red Bull and just kind of hang out eerily. I'm thinking I need to make a phone call somehow, but asking around feels wrong, plus the gas station is 100% dead. No watch but I think this was near 2AM. After about 20 minutes I figure it's safe to check, so I slowly undo the lid on the tank and while I'm derping around with the radiator cables a bakkie rolls up. I don't know the American word from it. I guess truck? Y'know, those little cars with the open backs that you can load shit onto?

 

Context. In South Africa the Afrikaans people tend to drive bakkies 'cause for the most part they do a lot of labor or farming work. That's a stereotype, but in this case, it was accurate. They're blasting some Dubstep type of music. They hoddle out, probably drunk, laughing loudly, and go into the store. When they come out I'm still knee deep in my car, putting coolant in with the petrol attendant, and they come up to me.

 

They're wearing wife beaters and Monster Energy caps, jeans and flip flops, both matching, and the way they approached me was just creepy. They kind of boxed me in from both sides and asked what trouble I was having. I tell them briefly, not paying much attention to them. And then the one guy says, ""You know how dangerous it is out here? Some dude will come and stab you and take your wallet. We live close, why don't you come stay with us?""

 

So my fucking, ""creeps lay off please"" mood is setting in and I just flat out say no, and I'm pretty aggressive about it.

 

And they go quiet and I look up from my car and see them both smiling to each other. And the other guy goes, ""I don't think you understand,"" and walks a little closer. ""I think you'll be much safer if you come with us.""

 

I'm pretty much done by this point. I'm done trying to be nice or tactful to get through the night. I turn around, lean against the front of my car and tap my finger against my nose. ""I think you should fuck off,"" I say. They take it pretty well and back off without a word. I close my car up and start talking to the gas attendant about it. He agrees that it was pretty strange. I ask him if I can use his phone and he says sure, so to random petrol attendant guy, thank you so much. I call my friend and he wakes up and I tell him as briefly as I can what happened, just, minor details. He laughs and says he'll wait outside for me in 15 minutes when I come over. He has a laugh over my weird ass night but mid phone call I hear a scream:

""YOU FUCKING KAFFIR!""

 

Kaffir is a really bad word in South Africa. Imagine ""nigger"" on steroids. Seriously. Afrikaans farmers used to say it to black slaves, and remember that this is a lot closer to home than American slavery considering Apartheid only really ended in '94, and the treatment was brutal as hell. Long story short, this word is fucking serious, and it's not something you hear actors blurt out ""by mistake"". It's just so taboo that hearing it makes me feel dirty.

 

I tell my buddy I have to go but I'll meet up with him soon, and the two Afrikaans guys are roughing up the petrol attendant who was nice enough to keep me company and let him make a phone call. It's not terrible, but they're yelling right in his face and pushing him, and he's pretty visibly scared.

 

I snap. I used to do a fair amount of fighting, and then one day I realized I didn't want to be a dick so I gave it up and I hadn't thrown a punch since I was 16 by that time (which was a pretty big deal for me considering I used to compete and when I wasn't competing I was being a dick). But I snapped. I ran over with a scream that would've put King Leonidas to shame. They get a huge fright because I overpowered their racist yelling. I punch the first one with running force. The guy didn't even try and defend it, so I could tell they didn't really know what they were doing. I grab the other one and pull a headbutt, because, hey, it's fucking late. They're both on the floor, not unconscious, but I'm so not interested in them that I turn away. I take the petrol attendant and make sure he's okay. He's just thanking me.

 

Then I get hit by what feels like a fucking hammer in the back of my head. I drop down and quickly turn around and sure enough the two of them are back on their feet. I put my legs up and kind of guard from a few half-assed kicks and think it over. I really didn't feel like fighting. The main reason I stopped is that my adrenaline rushes would make me feel like puking and crying for no damn reason, and I'm kind of feeling a combination of that and rage by now. Finally I say: ""Listen. I'm going to jump onto my feet now. If you still wanna be here when that happens, I'm not going to let you get back up.""

 

They back off. The one guy's face is bloody from the headbutt already. They get in their car and say ""We're coming back for you and that fucking kaffir!""

 

I'm not too worried because I'm gonna leave soon, and it's not like they're gonna follow me, right? I tell the petrol attendant to tell the cops and wait until they show up. They agree to keep an eye on things but tell me that I shouldn't go off on my own. I insist I'll be fine.

 

I pull out and head back the way I came. I cross back over the highway, but just before I do I notice a car behind me doing a U-Turn so that it's right behind me. I'm a little nervous,  but again I pass it off as coincidence. I was actually feeling pretty calm by this point. I think I got a lot of my anger out with the racist guys from earlier. My head is pounding a bit from the blow but it's not too bad.

 

I turn my indicator on and he mimics me. I take a closer look at the car and sure enough it's a bakkie, but I can't make out the faces of the drivers, but there are definitely at least two guys sitting on the back. So now I'm on this tiny, one lane road that leads around to Linboro Park because the main road is closed off. Linboro Park is also as quiet as a quiet neighborhood gets, so I'm not going to run into anyone who's gonna help me and I'm pretty obviously being tailed by now.  

 

I rev my car as fast as I can. I'm not a great driver, but my car was obviously way faster than whatever they were rolling with. I take the corner while shitting myself that I'm going to spin out or flip over, and I'm setting a decent amount of distance, but they're definitely trying to speed up and follow me. I go down the first actual Linboro Park road, kill my lights and make a right turn, which happens to be the road to my buddy's house. I kill the engine and park under a tree because that shit always works in Need for Speed. Meanwhile they roll past slowly and...see my car so they make the turn. I call myself a retard and quickly start up and drive off again.

 

My buddy Gordon isn't outside like he said he'd be, so I literally have nothing to do other than circle around a bit. They start yelling and waving cricket bats around and I'm kind of in fight-or-flight mode so not much analyzing is going on in my head. After about three trips around the block and a bunch of screaming later, Gordon is finally outside. I quickly loop my car into their driveway, jump out and close the gate. The red necks stop their car and get out and start banging on the gate.

 

Gordon is massive. He's got that archetypical rugby player build. 6.5"" at least, 130kgs, most of it muscle. He asks me what the fuck is going on and I tell him that ""some assholes were roughing up a gas attendant and now they're pissed off with me 'cause Princess over there bleeds too easily.""

 

South African gates are pretty secure, because, fuck me, crime, and Gordon's family has had a lot of break ins, so they made the place Fort Knox with a crazy electric fence. So they can't get past but they can yell and be obnoxious. Gordon sizes them up and tells me that there's only four of them and we could probably take them. I tell him it's so not fucking worth it and we could just call the cops. He laughs and tells me to wait there. I'm not happy with it, but he drives my car up the long ass driveway while I sit there and listen to four dudes being pissed off. It was actually kind of funny, in retrospect, because all they wanted to do was beat me to a pulp but the gate was too much of an issue.

 

It takes forever but Gordon finally gets back. He steps out the car and with a big grin starts firing his paintball gun. It wasn't just one of those normal, shitty ones. He spent about $500 on a ridiculous handheld gun that looked like something out of Halo. He also had it loaded with one pepper bullet and one rubber pullet for the whole 30-clip magazine. It also had a daddy gas canister on it. Gordon pelts them a few times and the pepper spray bullets really get them coughing. They get into the car, pull their wife beaters over their mouths, whatever, and drive off. The funny thing is the pepper spray worked so well they couldn't even yell anything as they drove off, just flipped us the bird and ""aghbr, aghuii"".

 

Gordon was laughing his ass off and I can't blame him, but I was honestly so full of terror, anger, confusion and all-round ""fuck this world"" to really find humor in it. I told him some of what happened. What I remembered. Truthfully though, he missed out on a lot of the details. A lot. So Reddit is the first to ever hear the full story of the most consistently fucked up night.

 

I got inside and it was 4AM, and I had the most deserved beer of my entire fucking life. Now. Have you ever watched one of those horror movies where everything seems to be sorted out and they drag the story line out for no fucking reason, and you're just like 'PLEASE CAN THIS SHITTY MOVIE END??' Yeah. That's about to happen.

This story takes place when I am 15, I was small for my age and did not properly hit puberty until 16 and had almost no experience with boys other than a few smooches with my new 'boyfriend' (it lasted  4 weeks!) Like many girls my age I earnt some money babysitting for friends and family. 

I had babysat for one family 4-5 times, the husband was a friend of my Dads from the pub and a generally well known face in the community and his wife was always lovely. It was a 10 min walk to my house so my parents would usually collect me as it would be late when I finished, however this time a friend had agreed to pick me up. I called him around 12.30am when the parents came home and he apologised and said he couldn't pick me up anymore as he was over the limit... SHIT, my parents were in bed thinking I had plans! The father kindly offered to walk me home... ok I can trust this man, after all he is my Dads friend. As soon as we left I realised he was drunk, really drunk. a few metres from his house he bumps in to me *twice* and giggles 'oops' brushing up against me. Weird but accidents happen... as we are walking I notice his eyes flicker to my teeny new breasts, ok really weird! He asked me about school, friends etc I answer truthfully, I was a pretty innocent well behaved teen! Then boyfriends... I shyly told him I had my first boyfriend and he made a comment like 'Naughty girl, I should tell your Dad!' well my Dad knew so I laughed. Told him this and said 'I wouldn't hide it from Dad, I am a good girl' 
Him: Are you always a good girl?
Me: Umm yeah ofcourse
Him: But are you *always* good?
Me: Ummm yeah...
Him: Are you ever *naughty?*
CREEP ALERT! 
I start to stutter and mumble incoherently, no idea how to respond when he grabs my hand... a few seconds later placing it on his crotch! SHIT I'M GOING TO BE RAPED AND KILLED! I ripped my hand away and began shaking and crying, to scared to run in case he chases me. Seeing my distress he apologises and promises not to touch me again but continues to walk me home. Out side my front door a look of horror spreads across his face and he pleads with me to not tell my parents. I run in lock the door and tell my Mum who looked outside to see him sat on the curb crying... We didn't go to the police as I was too ashamed (believing I had led him on) but Dad confronted him and he has been shunned in the community ever since. 

TL;DR:15 year old me touched up by Dads drunk friend after babysitting for him and his wife. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1356803673.0	15mr0z	My brush with death	PumpkinDevourer	204	33	39	"So, a couple years ago I was in a godawful relationship with a girl whom I know now has borderline personality disorder and is a complete amoral bitch. Every morning I would run a mile from my house to hers and prop my body in the window to her room, then leave when she let me. On one of these return trips, I was running back home on a freezing winter night, on the phone with her.

Recently, my family had been showing some serious concern for me, telling me how dangerous the streets were and how many people died. I ignored them of course, because this girl had me wrapped around her finger.

So, I'm running, it's dark and freezing, and in my ear is a usual blend of insults, arguing, etc., when I here somebody yell ""Hey yo, who's that?!""

I stopped and turned and saw somebody walking from their driveway, eyeballing me suspiciously. I held my palms in the air as the universal sign for ""I'm harmless"" and said ""Nobody"" before resuming my jog home. As I cleared a street, I heard the same man, this time more hostile. ""Come here"". I ignored him, figuring he was just going to mug me, wasting both of our time as I was broke. He kept calling me, pursuing me through several streets, until he changed up his yell.

""Hey yo!""

Again, I ignored him, but I stopped because I was out of breath from running in the cold. Then I heard two loud bangs from behind me.

I never believed anybody when they said that the world slows down if you're frightened or worked up enough, but I found it to be true immediately. My brain jumped to attention as I put together what just happened, felt a dull stinging on my hip, and smelled something I only remember smelling from sparklers or near fireworks. I screamed ""HOLY SHIT"" at the top of my lungs before desperately sprinting faster than I've ever moved in my entire life for cover. I tripped over some construction debris, but somehow managed to roll or scramble somehow straight into another sprint as I heard bang after bang erupt behind me. My phone flew out of my hands and down the street at some point. I saw a police car and desperately waved my hands and screeched (yes, as a man I'm willing to admit I screeched like a little girl at this point) ""HELP ME"" as loud as my lungs allowed, only to watch them take off after a van that fled the gunshots when I did.

I got home and saw a line scooped out of my hip and realized that I'd have died had I moved an inch differently. I never found out why somebody felt the need to empty their gun in an attempt to kill some poor bastard in a fucked up relationship, but I learned a thing or two that night."	t5_2t3t8	True
1341554571.0	w48ti	Attempted kidnap.	Jampur	206	32	15	"Hey Reddit, was only recently made aware of this from my parents as I have no recollection of it whatsoever. I grew up in the North-East of Scotland which is pretty rural, the year was 1992 and I was 5 years old.

From what they've told me, it was a warm summers day and I was playing down the road with one of the neighbours kids, happily splashing in a paddling pool but seemingly unsupervised (which is dangerous in itself in my opinion, although my parents assured me they thought I was being properly looked after). It had been roughly two hours, when they got a knock on the front door asking if me and the other kid were at our house, or if we'd been seen.

My parents immediately started to panic as they hadn't seen or heard either of us, and they were bloody angry at the morons who'd been left in charge of us. A search of the neighbourhood ensued and after 5 hours we still weren't found. The police were called and they came out to take statements from people in the street and help with the search. 

We were found about 1 and a half hours walk away from our home, being led hand-in-hand by a 17 year old boy, in to a large forest area. We were literally spotted just in time, a minute later and we would have been inside the forest and at the mercy of this creep.

It turns out the lad was one of the neighbours kids, and he had a history of violence and schizophrenia, and he'd seen me and the other little lad splashing in the pool and decided he'd come and talk to us. From the statement he gave the police, he said that he'd promised to take us to our parents and then just continued to walk. He claims to have not remembered leading us to the forest, and also said that he didn't know what his reasons were for taking us there.

Pretty freaky shit to be told, but glad I couldn't remember any of it! Especially after hearing stories such as the Jamie Bulger one (we also share the same first name), parents can never be too careful with young children."	t5_2t3t8	True
1334992229.0	sl0qf	My date with a junkie in college	Rhynovirus	219	47	52	"This story takes place when I was 19 or 20 in college on the east coast of the USA. In a particular class we were given a team assignment and asked to turn to our neighbor next to us to cover the material. This is how I met Jackie. Jackie was 5'5-ish and of what I presumed to be slender build. I couldn't really tell because she was clad head to toe in a black goth-punk inspired dress. She looked vaguely Asian and wore thick white eye makeup which set off the highlights of her dye-damaged, slightly ratty blonde hair. Still, there was something interesting about her, even if she struck me as odd. To this day I remember my most potent impression of her was that she seemed ""dirty"". In the unwashed sense.

For context, at this point in my life I was a very slim guy of average style who was largely into geeky things like Starcraft and paintball and only realizing now, after the fact, how popular I had actually been in high school among the underclass girls I knew through various clubs and sports. I was on the nerdy edge of normal for a college guy. Nothing about me would have made you think that a girl like Jackie would be at all interested in me. 

But I digress. We set about our work and completed our in class assignment. It turned out to be the start of a research project which we were to finish together and so we made arrangements to meet that weekend.  Everything went great and we completed our work quickly. While we were working we started talking about some common interests, namely language and politics and music. You see, I have always been a big Bad Religion fan. This, I suppose, piqued her interest because she asked me if I'd like to go with her to a ""Gothic Industrial show.""  

I had no idea what that even was but I wanted to find out, so I accepted.  How bad could it be? I had no other plans and I could manage to ignore the musty smell and the fact that she was wearing the same dress she had on three days ago in class. 

Besides, I was just discovering that girls could actually like me and I wanted to experiment with my new powers. 

10pm that night I walk down to her place to meet her. She's repaired her eyeshadow though the hair is still as unkempt as ever, the eyes are a bit wide and the dress is unchanged.  We walk over to the club and I'm starting to feel uneasy.  Maybe it has to do with the fact that I'm wearing Levis, doc martens and a band t-shirt and everyone else looks like they stepped out of a Marilyn Manson video? Who can really say? Nonetheless I decide I am going to be open minded so we stroll inside to the humming single frequency bass beats of what I presume was a great example of gothic industrial.

No one is dancing.  People are standing there like the Zombies in I Am Legend just kind of rocking back and forth to undefined gothnoise droning like mind control waves through the air, floor, and walls. Reflexively I looked for Jackie who had closed her eyes and joined in the strange ritual. Surreal. After the song she tells me she ""needs to piss bad"" and asks me to get beers for us.  Mind you, I don't even have ID at this point, but fuck it I stroll over like a boss and demand beers. No questions asked the bartender hands them over. 

When I return to Jackie she has obtained some clove cigarettes which she shares with me. Sign clearly said no smoking but 0 fucks were given.  We ""dance"" to another few songs long enough to drain our beers when Jackie declares the show ""lame"" and asks me to take her back to her place. 

I oblige and as we walk back the subject turns to drugs. ""So what kind of shit have your tried?"" she asks me. Sheepishly I tell her I haven't done much.  She replies with her own list of experiences which could probably fill a drawer at the DEA.  Meth, Coke, Heroin, Ketamine, Pot to take the edge off and LSD.  If drugs were Pokemon she'd be Gary Oak.

At this point I'm starting to feel like I'm in over my head.

We get back to her place and it's a fucking mess. Cigarette butts all over the floor, filth on every flat surface, old fast food bags, black thong underwear strewn about, half empty liquor bottles and Jackie's characteristic smell. 

Now I was feeling really conflicted. Something, maybe the genetic imprint of the bro code*, was telling me to run but more primal forces were urging me to stay. I stayed. I had to see the trainwreck.

We sit down on her sticky green shag carpet and start talking again about politics. Jackie was well read to be as messy as she was and we had a pretty good talk.  She disappears into her bedroom to shed her blouse, returning in a black tank top with her stereotypical skirt.  And she held a mirror. 

What could this be for? 

Right in front of me Jackie pours out 3 lines of coke and snorts 2 of them like they're Afrin. She offers me the straw. I decline... and so she snorts the other one with the opposite nostril. I would have been astonished except that she continued our conversation like nothing at all had happened. She was completely lucid.

We smoked cigarettes and continued our chat which eventually turned again to drugs and our drug experiences.  At some point I made up a lie about having tried acid, simply to have a little cred and to keep Jackie going with her storytelling.  She asked me what else I'd like to try.  By now we were sharing her bong and had been sipping the alcohol she had around. Jackie was completely smoking me out with some of the best weed I've ever had. 

Eventually she realizes my relative inexperience and joyfully offers to let me try anything I want from her stash.  From a ziploc bag in a purple Crown Royal pouch she produces:

* stamp like things I presume were LSD
* several white rocks
* three small yellow rocks
* diabetes syringes
* a vial (which I later learned was ketamine)
* pot
* a rainbow's worth of pills
* various and sundry pipes

I did not know what to do. And with THC skewing my reason I was having a hard time figuring it out.  Jackie, ever unflappable, suggested that we start with Ketamine.  ""But while you think about it""

...she begins to tie a shoelace around her arm 

...and starts cooking heroin in a spoon above the scented candle we'd been chatting around. 

...and after offering me first go (which I decline) injects herself

At this point all my DARE training from elementary school is kicking in and I know I have to leave or probably die.  I start to work out my exit strategy, not wanting to hurt Jackie's feelings, when I notice her relax against the couch. 

""Oh yeah that is real good.  So anyway, President Bush is not afraid of...""

It was unbelievable! By now I had a story worked out, I just needed the testicular fortitude to get my legs moving. The weed was outstanding and combined with the alcohol my body was fighting me to stay put.  I forced myself to quickly relay my excuse for leaving.  Something or other about it already being 2am and having to do a project in the morning...

Jackie broke a pink pill in half and swallowed it.  She offered me the rest. Feeling rude I accepted but cheeked it (and spit it behind the couch when she closed her eyes again).

She considered what I'd said for a second and replied ""Oh that's cool. You wanna make out? You can just crash here.""

She moved closer and put her arm around mine, caressing my hand.  Fortunately clarity began to return. My mind pointed out to me that anyone this functional after this many drugs does them regularly, that IV drugs are bad and that I should GTFO ASAP. 

I tell her I really need to go, and ask if she has water.  She points to the kitchen and tells me to help myself. 

And then she uttered these words I still vividly remember and possibly still fap to:

""I'm probably gonna pass out from the heroin soon so if you wanna fuck me after that's cool. I'm on the pill.""

I got my water but could still barely stand after all the weed. I tell her I'll crash the next time and after a kiss goodnight, and her collapse onto her couch, I leave to stumble the 5 blocks back to my dorm.

I never saw Jackie in class again. "	t5_2t3t8	True

I'm pretty sure this experience occurred when I was seeing Dolly Parton, which makes it all the more terrifying. 
I was wandering around with my mom when a man on stilts walked (stilted?) in front of us. This was sort of alarming in and of itself since I was so little, and I remember him looking at us with a sort of menacing gaze. 
""The man on stilts thinks you're very pretty,"" he said to me. At which point my mother grabbed my hand and pulled me away to another part of the field. A little later I was waiting in line for the bathroom (just a porta-potty) and I saw him again, but he was bothering someone else. 
When it was finally my turn, I sat down and then noticed that it suddenly got pretty dark in there. Something was blocking the light coming in from the semi-translucent ceiling. And then: 

""The man on stilts can see you.""  

I ran out as fast as I could, and I've never been able to go into a porta-potty without thinking about that guy since."	t5_2t3t8	True

He says extremely inappropriate things about women to them and asks children very personal information (I've heard him ask for addresses!) even when their guardian tells their child to not talk to him and they move seats away form him a such. He's made me cry before because of how much of a piece of meat he makes me feel like. Not even a human, just a pair of tits and legs. I work at restaurant/lounge and my uniform is a black skirt and black top. You're pretty much suppose to look nice, well put together and attractive. I wear my uniform on the bus ride there because I don't like changing at work. About a week ago I got on the bus to go to work and he was their harassing a new mother and her baby. I could tell this women was just trying to be polite/trying to ignore him. He was asking her if she has a boyfriend or a husband, she just ignores him hoping he'll go away or stop. He then sees me a leans over to me and looks me up and down and says "" nice legs and skirt"". I say ""thank you"" not looking up from my phone. He then starts asking me about where I'm going. Something clicked inside of me and I couldn't deal with this guy any more. I told him "" I'd really appreciate it if you didn't talk to me. You make me very uncomfortable with what you say about me and how you act"".  He starts saying "" Im just trying to be nice"". I tell him again he make me uncomfortable and I don't want to talk to him. He left me alone. 

This post is less about my story and more about people being very passive and being polite! I am addicted to LetsNotMeet and read a lot of stories on here about people not letting a creeper know when they've crossed a line. I recently read a story about a girl being on a bus a guy putting his hand on her thigh and she didn't do ANYTHING about it! Or another one where sexual things get brought up in a conversation with a strange man on public transit and they laugh it off and don't tell what they are doing is inappropriate. TELL THAT PERSON WHEN THEY'RE MAKING YOU UNCOMFORTABLE! Creeps stalk the weak and the people who will put up with their shit trying to be ""polite"". You have a voice, use it!"	t5_2t3t8	True
1370069800.0	1fgcyb	Heads-up Toronto gals: NOT the Cash Cab.	astrochica	203	31	17	"(This happened to a friend of mine a few days ago and I thought it was important to share so that others in the area can be aware)

My friend, a 28yo F, was walking on Bay St. at night when she heard men's voices coming from a cab passing her on the street. She said she heard something about 'cash cab' before she lost sight of them behind a bus stop as they slowed, then stopped for a red light.

As she passed the bus stop, she saw them asking another young woman a question. The woman shrugged and walked away. My friend then walked a bit further which brought her directly into the field of view of the two, 30-something men in its backseat. 

They then called out to her, ""Hey, what's the deepest ocean trench?"" She didn't see any camera crew or the host of Cash Cab, so she was confused. Still she knew the answer so she replied, ""the Marianas."" One guy said, ""See we would have gotten it right! Hey you're really smart, come be on the cash cab with us!"" They then opened the door, the second guy shoved over and the first moved to the middle seat, gesturing for her to get in. 

Again, not having seen any indication that this was truly THE Cash Cab, she said she ""was totally and utterly weirded out at this point"" so she declined. As she described it, she shook her head awkwardly and walked away.

It wasn't until later that she realized just how truly creepy this was because - although she couldn't put her finger on it at first - the two men seemed completely sober (so obviously they weren't some drunken idiots having a laugh). She wonders if this wasn't a set up for a kidnapping/rape and so reported it to the police. She regrets she didn't get the plate number and isn't even certain if the car was a real cab (although it looked like it).

Hopefully no one will fall for this trick but thought it would be a good idea to share the story anyway just in case. Please share this w/ any friends/family (especially women) you know in Toronto! Thanks! "	t5_2t3t8	True
1369430365.0	1eztxd	Don't Forget the 3 S's!!	HSMems	194	19	15	"Here's an interesting encounter, it took approximately 19 years to realize just how dangerous this situation could have become had we taken this creep up on his offer.

When I was growing up my aunt used to babysit me at her house about half of the weekdays. She had three kids, my cousins: Mikey, who is 2 years younger than me and was (still is) one of my closest friends, Robert, who is 5 years older, and Jane, who is about 7 years older.    

One afternoon we were all playing in the front yard without my aunt, as Jane was old enough to keep an eye on us. At some point this random guy in his late 20's, wearing a polo tucked into khaki shorts that were way above the knee, with greasy hair and a porn stache walks over to us with a huge smile on his face and tries to start talking to us.

At first we were wary, but he was very friendly, and he wasn't in a car. There were four of us and one of him so we were relatively safe. He said his name was Jeffrey Boop and that he had just moved in down the road, and he was looking to make some new friends. (with little kids?) He said he had a swimming pool, and we were all invited as long as we ""brought the 3 S's! A swimsuit, a smile, and a six-pack of Coke!""

We obviously noped the hell out of there, but we distinctly remember those 3 S's because it became an inside joke among us. Creepy Jeffrey Boop and the 3 S's! This joke continued to pop up every now and again between us throughout *our entire lives.* ""Don't forget the 4 S's! A swimsuit, a smile, a six-pack of Coke, and a *sword* to kill Jeffrey Boop!"" .. etc.

Fast forward to today, about 19 years later. Mikey and I are getting ready to go on a fishing trip, and he suggests we get some pop, so naturally I make a Jeffrey Boop reference. 

Mikey and I like to dig on the internet, we pretend like we're amateur detectives or something. Mikey decides to do a little research into our old friend and see what he's up to - or if there was anything on the internet about him. 

The first thing we stumble upon is a now defunct social media profile, with a picture of him *exactly as we remember him* that gave us chills. Caption: [Late '90s, anxiously awaiting house guest..](http://imgur.com/YoB8KVV) I mean this creeped us the hell out, but it was nothing compared to the [U.S. Marshals Service press release](http://www.usmarshals.gov/news/chron/2011/061611a.htm) we found next. This guy was the real deal. 

Jeffrey Boop was a dangerous sexual predator and child pornographer. And wanted us to bring our swimsuits to his pool so he could make new friends. *shudder...* 

I believe he is currently in prison. 

TL;DR: Sexual predator and Child Pornographer invites us kids over for a pool party, we don't realize until many years later."	t5_2t3t8	True
1367878214.0	1dtka1	I Say Goodbye, you say Hello Kitty...	Red1332	230	57	77	"I waited to dole this one out because it was incredibly creepy and also the one time I absolutely ignored my gut regarding something and seriously regretted it. (LISTEN TO YOUR GUT, PEOPLE. And call the police. Jeebus, CALL. THE. POLICE.)

ANYWAY.

About 5 years ago I worked for a nationwide telecom that I guarantee everybody knows (or knew) as technical support. If your internet wasn't working, your modem was on fire or you were angry your friends were pwning you in Call of Duty, you called me up and complained. 9 times out of 10, I fixed you. Unless you complained about ping times, then we all secretly laughed about you and knew it was your mad leet skills getting you pwned, and not our connection.

But I digress.

I am a redhead, and that is important because that is most likely what started this entire thing. People have strange assumptions about redheads. People also have strange fascinations with them.

I was a measly Tier II rep stuck in a miserable job and there was a guy in Tier III named Jerry who somehow discovered my existence (we were literally on opposite sides of a building an acre wide). He would stop by often to talk with me, and quite often he came by with his son. People started to poke fun because he had no reason to be over in our section, and he only ever brought his young son to visit with the people in my row.

He never talked about having a wife, and the lone time I was in his cube I noted he had pictures of his boy everywhere, but none of a Mrs. Jerry. He also didn't wear a ring. By these things I thought that he must be a single father, and that when he visited with his son, that was when he had custody.

I was single at the time, although just starting a long distance relationship with the man that would eventually become my husband. So when Jerry came around more and more often, or would drop whatever he was doing to come check something weird I found on the server's back end, it became obvious he had a crush on me.

I thought it was cute and he seemed like a cool enough guy, so I chatted him up, exchanged emails outside of work, and considered becoming friends with this guy, maybe more if the long-distance thing fell through.

That is, until he started just acting utterly bizarre.

He commented often about my red hair and what he thought of red heads, that they were much more fiery and sensual people. I could understand him saying that once, maybe jokingly... but he mentioned it often, and asked if I dyed it or if it were natural, if I felt more fiery because of it, etc... digging, it seemed.

At one point as I was leaving work a car suddenly shot out in front of me, almost causing a collision. I managed to slam on my breaks before I hit the other vehicle, and was downright pissed at whoever hadn't been paying attention... lo and behold, it was Jerry waving and sporting a goofy smile.

Then small gifts started showing up on my desk that were strangely appropriate. Incense. Hello Kitty pins. A comb. After a few hours I would receive an IM asking ""did you find your surprise?""

These in and of themselves were not threatening, but they followed the second he found out anything new about me. I mentioned I loved Hello Kitty, it showed up. I mentioned I loved a certain band... he torrent-ed entire libraries full of stuff for me. It was sweet, but excessive, more as if he was grasping on to any information he got to prove that he was listening and interested in me.

I talked him in to stopping with the gifts, as he didn't make a whole lot more than I did and it felt strange because I couldn't reciprocate based on frequency alone. It also felt strange because I wasn't trying to  date him, but he kept pushing for that in our conversations and it made me uncomfortable.

But then other strange things started happening. At this point he was calling me up and asking if we could hang out at local bars. I went because I didn't have too crazy a social life. And when he found out that the LDR guy had started to come down and visit, he started showing up half an hour after the guy had left to hang out. The visits were less to check up on how my relationship was doing and felt far more like somebody re-establishing territory.

After I drove up to see my LDR, though, I came home to discover my apartment had been invaded. There was a fire escape that led up to the window to my bedroom, and I found the screen popped and the window obviously opened. Nothing was taken, but something was left. A box of Hello Kitty bandaids was in my bathroom and a flower was sitting on my computer desk.

After I came back from a 2nd trip, I discovered that every window on my car was covered in soap... not soaped like kids soap it, but in German, professing love and quoting parts of famous German love poems (I speak German as a 2nd language).

I washed my car and said nothing about it although he asked if I had received any messages upon coming back. I played dumb, and this seemed to anger him. He didn't talk to me for a few days.

I started to get texts and emails constantly. He would just show up with food for me if I had posted on my blog that I had a craving for cheeseburgers. He decided that was our ""thing"", the cheeseburgers, and would show up with them a lot, barely giving me 5 minutes notice via text. I was dirt poor, so they were a luxury and I will admit it... I didn't tell him to buzz off, I ate them. I tried to stress, though, that I thought he was cool and it was sweet of him but I fully intended to repay him because *that's what friends do*.

Basically, I was an idiot and didn't listen to the screaming voice in my head that said ""SOMETHING IS WRONG HERE. HE IS NOT BEHAVING THE WAY YOUR OTHER GUY FRIENDS DO.""

Then.... here is the crowning stupid thing of all stupid things to do... I got in a fight with LDR that I thought was really bad... bad enough that he wouldn't talk to me again. I was upset and made the mistake of mentioning it to him.... he was over 10 minutes later to ""comfort"" me.... yes, that is a euphemism. You can guess what happened next, and I still kick myself repeatedly for it.

We get done and his phone starts going crazy in his pocket. He grabs it and looks panicked, then starts getting dressed in a hurry.

""I'm really sorry,"" he says, ""but my wife keeps texting me and I think she's starting to suspect what we're doing.""

Wait. WAIT. WHAT??? *WHAT??!!*

And then I flip out, because he has never, ever mentioned he had a wife. I called him on it, pointed out that he didn't have a wedding band... and he informs me that in his branch of Christianity, they don't believe in rings as only god can sanctify a marriage. So he didn't wear one.

I felt incredibly stupid, incredibly duped, and incredibly upset because I would not have touched the guy or accepted any of his overzealous gifts had I known he was married.

He literally RAN from my apartment, peeled out and got home... and I got a text later from him saying he'd stopped at a foreign supermarket so he could lie to his wife that he'd been looking for one specific thing and that's why he disappeared for so long. He ended it by saying that he was looking forward to comforting me again soon.

Which was not going to happen, and I told him that.

Apparently his wife was monitoring him after that because I didn't get any more texts for a few days and I specifically avoided him at work. I was hoping to just ignore him in to obscurity and make peace with the fact that I'd pretty much had an affair. Just thinking about him made me feel dirty.

Then the texts started again, asking when he could see me again. If I drove somewhere for lunch, he was there trying to talk to me and kiss me. At one point I went for a walk on a nature trail and he surprised me, trying to drag me down in to a hay bail so we could have a quickie before going back to work. I told him each time that it was not going to happen and managed to get back to work.

He broke in to my place once more, but if he left anything I never found it. He dropped by with freshly picked thistle flowers one day without telling me he was coming so I could avoid him. I closed the door as quickly as I could.

I was at a rather cool pub with my LDR, having made up with him (and even confessed to the indiscretion, which he eventually forgave me for) when Jerry showed up and sat down at our booth. He just stared at my LDR as if he wanted to kill him with his mind. He later texted me to say ""That was supposed to be OUR pub, I'm furious you took him there.""

Finally, the kicker... I was at home when he showed up, again without warning. He managed to push his way in and excitedly informed me of the following...

His wife had told him that evening that she was pregnant with their second child, and he promptly told her that he no longer wanted to be married to her, as he had found his soul mate and he didn't want to be tied to another child with her. He then assured me this meant that he was now free to be with me and it would no longer pose a problem.

I was shocked, then furious. You don't do that to a pregnant woman, and I couldn't understand why he was acting so horribly. I kicked him out as best as I could (he was much taller and stronger than me) but the texts came rocketing in as soon as I heard him exit the lobby door. He loved me. He needed me. His wife wasn't understanding of his needs and he hadn't wanted a second child, etc, etc.

A little later that evening I got an email explaining that she was really just angry because he had had an affair before with another red headed girl whom he'd gone to technical school with, and that she would calm down after she realized they weren't meant to be together. This other red-head, by the way, was nowhere near as sensitive or amazing as I was.

That was it. I was done. I blocked his email, ignored his texts, and made sure that I was never alone anywhere. I didn't answer my door unless I knew a friend was coming over, and I redid my schedule so he couldn't track me and show up at my usual haunts.

Even then, he still managed to find me, leaving wildflowers under my windshield wiper to show he'd been there. At one point I found a stuffed Hello Kitty by my front door.

At that point I was scared because he was obviously unbalanced and he had figured out how to IM me. He was telling me about how he was going to die alone if I left him, that his church was excommunicating him so his family wouldn't be allowed to talk to him... really pouring it on heavy. He even somehow managed to call my phone AROUND the block (from a pay phone, maybe?) and left me a message where he was outright weeping and barely intelligible.

I realized there was no way out of this, and that I had to get out of the area if I could. After a long talk with LDR, who had moved an hour south of me to be near family, he invited me to move in with him. I quit my job and moved in with him promptly to get out of the area.

All seemed quiet for about a month, but then there was one parting shot... somehow he managed to hack my email and got LDR's email address. He then sent him a long, rambling email about the importance of honesty and virtue and that he felt it was his duty to tell LDR in depth about our dalliances, of which there were many (there were not). He even hinted that if he suspected I denied any of it, he had a hard drive full of photos of me in BDSM-type situations that I had willingly submitted to (there were not).

My beloved LDR calmly responded that we had talked about all of it, and that he had forgiven me and the rest was none of his fucking business. Then he blocked the guy's email and never talked about it again.

Seriously. Kids. Listen to your gut when it tells you to run like hell. I got a husband out of the deal, but it could've been soooo, soooo much worse.

TLDR: Coworker doesn't tell me he's married, pursues me, creeps on me, flips out on me, then harasses my boyfriend when I quit my job and move in with him 100 miles away to escape him.

* * edit * * - A lot of people are remarking on the fact that he broke in. There is a line between creepy and romantic and the *first* time it didn't seem creepy. It seemed awkwardly done in an ""oh, he's just not socially adept"" kind of way.

 After all, if my LDR had snuck in and left flowers on my bed, that would be considered sweet only because I care for him and it was not unwanted attention. At the time I still considered him a friend, although that did set off alarms for me. Which, to reiterate, I was being a fool and not listening to. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT..

1353682049.0	13o2cp	I'm glad I wasn't there when they showed up	onceastreetrat	217	44	43	"Location: 45 minutes north of Boston, Massachusetts. Gender: Female. Current age: 25

2 years ago, I was squatting in the attic of an old abandoned house. The house was full of furniture and stuff, and it was totally trashed and very dirty. I organized the attic and made a nest for myself of one half of it. My nook was fairly hidden behind boxes and things, and I designed a barricade for the door that only a small female such as myself could pass easily through. 

I didn't use that spot constantly, just when I was in the area. There was one time I showed up there at like 2 am, after I hadn't been there for a while. I intended to go up to my nest and get some sleep, but my intuition or whatever told me not to go inside. I really wanted to go up to my spot, but the closer I got the house, the more fear I felt. I decided to listen to my guts and sleep in the cemetery instead. 

I stayed away for a few days, but then one afternoon I just felt like hanging out there. I didn't have anywhere else to be at the time, and I just wanted some quiet time indoors. I thought maybe I'd take a nap or read a book or something. I walked up to the house, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. I didn't feel any fear or anything, so I went in through the back window as usual. Everything seemed normal until I got upstairs. Someone had obviously been there. 

The upstairs was even more trashed than usual. Furniture had been flipped around, shit had been tossed all over. There was a bedroom on the second floor, a full-length mirror used to hang on the wall. It looked like someone had punched the mirror, it was on the floor. It was damaged at the place where it looked like it had been punched, but it was mostly intact. I think that's probably where they blood came from, they must've punched it and hurt their hand. There was what looked like semen on the mirror, and written in marker the words, ""This was for you, bitch"". There was blood on the mirror, and the words, ""Fuck you, bitch"" and ""Cunt"" written on the wall with blood. A bunch of other similar words and curses were written on the wall in marker. The marker was on the floor.

Holy shit, right!? I froze. What if they were still in the house? I was pretty certain they weren't, though. Maybe I should've left right away, but I wanted to check my nest first and grab a few things before I never, ever went back. I went up to the attic and my barricade was totally wrecked. I guess it wasn't so strong after all. It probably would've bought me enough time to escape out the window onto the roof below, where I could've jumped to the ground. I'd rehearsed the escape route in my mind many times. Anyway, my nest was entirely ruined. It seemed like somebody had been looking for me and got really fucking pissed off when I wasn't there. The room wreaked of urine, I think they pissed on my sleep spot. There was more semen smeared on the wall. 

I never went back there again.

1350874660.0	11vkls	One of the most frightening moments of my entire life.	catsandcake	200	29	51	"This happened about two years ago, but the thought never occurred to me to post it on here until just now. It's definitely in my top five scariest things that have ever happened to me.

Sophomore year of college, I lived in a neighborhood that required a parking permit for your car; since my car was registered to my home address, I had to park it a couple blocks away from where I lived. Being a girl, I'm always a little freaked out when I walk alone at night, but this was a really nice neighborhood, so I usually wasn't too scared. 

Anyway, one night around 10:00 or so, I was walking to my car by myself when I saw a man walking down the street in my general direction. He looked completely normal: ~35 years old, wearing slacks, a tie, a button-down shirt, and glasses. As I was getting closer to my car, he walked over to me, getting in between me and my car. He said his car ran out of gas, and he was wondering where the closest gas station was so he could buy some and bring it back to his car. I gave him directions, and started toward my car again. He moved again, standing in between me and my car, and this is when I knew something was up.

The closer he got to me, the more I could tell he reeked of alcohol. He wasn't slurring his words or swaying or anything, so I couldn't tell at first that this man was really drunk. He said that he actually didn't have any money, and wondered if I could spare any change. His whole spiel about needing gas was clearly just a sob story to get some money out of me, but this guy was creeping me out, so I gave him the change in my pocked and tried to walk closer to my car. Again, he cut me off, preventing me from getting inside. I was probably about 10 feet away from it at this point. He stuck out his hand, and said, ""I'm Steven, nice to meet you. What's your name?"" 

I replied, ""Sorry, I'm really in a rush. Have a good night."" This was a bad idea. He got really, *really* upset about this. He said back to me something along the lines of, ""What, I'm not good enough to know your name? You won't even shake my hand? You fucking white yuppie piece of shit, thinking you can walk all over a scumbag like me. You're no better than me.""

He then grabbed my hand, but just to shake it. Luckily this wasn't the hand that my car keys were in. Frightened, I just stood there, shaking the man's hand. This apparently made him feel much better about himself though. He started telling me about how he had been drinking at a bar earlier that night and that he just wanted to get home. Then this guy got really crazy. I could see his eyes kind of gloss over, and he started talking about some club he was in - I think it was called Skulls and Crossbones, but I have no idea what that is, or if it's even a real club.  He then looked at me with this furious look in his eyes, his hand still gripping mine, and said, ""Oh god, you're with *them*! You're one of them! They're looking at us right now, aren't they?!"" I tried telling him I'm not ""with"" anybody, and that I didn't have anybody watching us. He started talking louder, and was getting much more frantic. He said, ""You are, I can see them in the trees right now. Their lasers are pointing right at us..."" Again, his eyes glossed over, and he started telling me about his life when he was younger. This is the part that really scared the shit out of me.

He said, ""When I was younger, I did something really bad."" He let go of my hand at this point, so I was free, but he was still standing in between me and my car. I slowly started circling around him so I could get closer to my car. But he kept talking, saying, ""When I was younger, I really fucked up my life. I did something awful. I ruined a young woman's life."" My heart was racing at this point, and I could feel my hands shaking, gripping my car keys. I was almost next to my car. He then said, ""I don't know why I did it, but I killed a woman. I *killed* her.""

Luckily, I was close enough to my car that I could jam the keys into the keyhole and hop in before he noticed what was happening. I turned on my car and sat there, blaring the horn until the man moved out of the way. I then raced home and called the police. All I knew about the man was that his name was Steven, and what he looked like. I didn't have much of a case against him, so I just told the police that there was a man planning on driving drunk that night, and to look out for him. It was that last sentence, him saying ""I *killed* her,"" that really scared me the most. I couldn't get to sleep that night, just due to the adrenaline pumping through my veins."	t5_2t3t8	True
1350783762.0	11tppr	"""The nice man."""	Matakria	202	32	26	"This happened when i was seven or eight, me and my younger sister were waiting in the doctors office for our parents, they both had appointments and told us to wait in the lounge and not move anywhere. my parents were very strict with us from a young age so we obeyed, and didn't even play with the toys they had set out for the younger children. 

Anyhow, a couple of minutes after my parents went into their appointment's a young guy walked in, he didn't go to the desk so he may have been waiting for someone. the man noticed me and my sister and smiled at us and sat next to me; now even as young as i was, i knew the rules, don't talk to strangers cause you simply never know. However, the rules usually applied only to creepy old men and woman, and the man looked like he was in his early twenties, near my eldest brother's age, so me and my sister didn't freak out near him. he looked normal, smiled normally and talked just like anyone else, we didn't feel creeped out at all. 

i had been reading a barbie book when he came in, and he started talking to me and my sister about barbies, we were amazed, we never thought grown ups could play with barbies too! he told us that he had lots of different clothes for them and all the cool new barbies that had just come out, my sister and i were impressed. soon he started trying to get more personal in the conversation, asking my sisters and mine's ages and names, at this point warning bells should have been ringing, but everyone seemed to think he was a cousin or relative from how we were talking to him, so they didn't do much but watch him ""baby sit us"" so we told him all of our information, besides, he knew about barbies, he seemed cool to us. 

after a while he told us a secret; he had lots of barbies in his car, and wanted us to see them, he said if we were good and came with him, he'll even give us some barbies. at first me and my sister were unsure, our parents had told us not to move, but the man seemed ok, and wasn't making us scared or anything, so after him telling us to follow him a few more times with the promise of new toys we finally agreed and got up to follow him to his car. however, there must have been some good out there that day cause just before he could lead us out, my parents arrived, both done with there appointments; they instantly assessed the situation and were furious, they grabbed us roughly and walked straight out the door.

 i tried to tell them that he was only going to give us barbies but they wouldn't listen and my sister and i started crying, the man, for some crazy reason, tried to follow, saying we were all just going to play a game, and there was no reason to freak out, my dad exploded on him. we were never taken to that exact doctors office again, so we never saw the man again as well, though sometimes i do wonder what would have happened if my parents hadn't come out when they did...

1369858316.0	1fag1y	The Road to Roswell	shug7272	198	25	23	"Anyway, looong story short but 100% true with no embellishment to liven it up. Im 20 years old at the time (wife was 18) and I am in the process of moving my mother and father from Texas to Roswell New Mexico. Long sleepy roads with not much to look at. I am in a large U Haul with my gigantic rottweiler that was a complete pansy for the family and demon for anyone else. My mother and wife are following me in my mothers car with a loaded hand gun that my ex marine father will not leave the home without.

My father is in a hospital in Roswell recovering from heart surgery at this time. We leave Brownfield and head towards Plains at about 10 pm. Well after dark but not too late. A plain white car with tinted windows pulls behind my mothers car that my wife is driving. No big deal. The car follows very close to them but is not aggressive and after this continues I tell my wife via cell phone (she called me concerned about the car) to back off my tail and give him room so he could pass her and then get in behind me to pass me. So many people are afraid to pass one car much less two at once I figured it was Granny Gibbons back there.

As she backs off the car backs off of her tail. This continues all the way to Plains at which point I call my wife and tell her to pull over and she does so following very close to my tail. We stop and the car passes right by and pulls over on the opposite side of the highway about 200 feet up and parked. I get the gun from the glove box knowing how to shoot it well enough. I made a joke to my wife and mother who are scared shitless at this point. I get in the u haul and call my wife and tell her to follow close. We leave and the white car follows all the way to Caprock at which time it has pulled next to the car my wife is driving several times and then pulled back behind her staying extremely close.

At Caprock my wife calls in tears and she is no pussy so I know at this point I need to do something. I tell the wife I am going to pull over and for her to pull in right in front of me. She does so and we park with me right on her ass on the side of the road in dark as night Caprock NM and the car pulls right in front of the wifes car. Im so scared I can barely move at this point. Im no coward but at this point I could barely make myself get out of the car. I am 6'5 and weighed about 280 at the time. Im not afraid to fight and have many times but dont particularly enjoy it. My wife is a beautiful, tiny HS grad at this time and my mother is aging. I feel like an alpha male so I pull by balls out of my ass which is where they had ended up due to fear and stepped out of the truck calling out to my dog to follow which he did enthusiastically. I walk to the front of my mothers car that my wife is driving and stand in the lights of her car staring at the white car with my beast of a dog at my side, the revolver still in my truck. After a few seconds the car pulled forward, turned around and went the other way. We continued to Roswell with no further incident.

No idea what happened but I know its absolutely true, every word."	t5_2t3t8	True
1366531558.0	1cshmw	When I woke up the next morning, I found the nightmares of my rape were true.	Bi_Bookish_Ent	268	98	55	"This was about four years ago, when I was a junior in college. I have an autoimmune disease that reared its ugly head for the first time that year, and I was in a lot of pain. 

One night, my long-term boyfriend and I were hanging out, and he wanted to have sex. I wasn't feeling well, so I declined. I took my prescriptions and went to sleep. 

That night, I had horrible nightmares that he was raping me... I've experienced sleep paralysis on a semi-regular basis throughout most of my life, and that's what it felt like. I couldn't move, I couldn't scream, but most of all, I couldn't *get him off of me*.

When I woke up in the morning, I was so ashamed... What kind of person has nightmares like that about someone they love so deeply? I was shaken and upset, so I called him (he was on campus for class) to tell him about these terrible dreams.

His response: ""We need to talk.""

I remember just sitting on the edge of the bed, waiting for him to get home. I felt cold, my heart was pounding, and my mind was turning cartwheels. I wanted more than anything for my suspicions to be untrue, but it turned out they weren't...

While I slept that night, he wanted to wake me with oral sex. When I didn't wake up, he just... kept going and started fucking me. He said he eventually stopped because he could ""tell I wasn't liking it"". I couldn't wrap my head around what he was telling me until an essential truth rang through me: those nightmares of him raping me were real. And during them, I had wanted to cry and scream and fight, but I couldn't move.

I'm working on not being too ashamed by this next part... His remorse, my shock, and the deep love I had for him made it so I forgave him. I went to therapy and kept a positive attitude, and didn't want him to hate himself. I couldn't deal with the ""r"" word, and my (male) therapist told me the ordeal was a ""grey area"" because my boyfriend and I were in a relationship.

We tried to move on, but things were never the same between us.

The rest of our story is painful to tell, but I'm glad to report that I've finally begun to deal with this trauma. I wrote him a few weeks back about the impact of what he'd done to me... that, although I had diminished it at the time, it still hurt. He lashed out, and I ended up having to block him from everything.

I've been having some symptoms of PTSD after finally dealing with something I was in such heavy denial about. I have been having nightmares much more frequently. I don't sleep well, so here I am at 4 in the morning... But I know I'll be ok, eventually.

1364116626.0	1awnzp	Two Teenage Boys try to get 8yr old swimsuit wearing unaccompanied Me to go Behind a Gas Station 	HuntersLoveABigRack	202	33	14	"When my older brother and I had summer vacation, we played all day every day.  This story happened when we were kids.  I was about 7 or 8 and he was about 11 or 12.  There was a woods behind my parents' house.  The woods ran down all the way to the woods by the pond at the end of the street.  So if my brother and I (I'm a girl, FYI) were gone from sunup to sundown, it was never a worry.  We played all day.  Sometimes played with other neighborhood friends and sometimes just us two.  Either way, summers were always a lot of fun.

One morning, my brother and I wanted to run through the sprinklers.  Then he asked if I wanted to go with him to the gas station for soda and candy.  He made more in his allowance and had some saved up.  I say that sure, I'd love to go.  I had on my swimsuit so I just put on my flip flops and hopped on my bike.  He threw a shirt over his trunks and put on his flip flops and hopped on his bike.  And off we went.  

The gas station was only about one mile away, so not that hard to get there.  My brother goes inside to get the goods and I wait in the parking lot to guard the bikes.  So here I am, an eight year old girl in a swimsuit, standing alone in the middle of the gas station parking lot.  And that's when I hear someone calling at me.  ""Pssst!  Hey, hey little girl!  Hey!""  the voice says.  I look over and see two teenage boys, maybe 15 or 16, standing behind the gas station.  They are taking a couple steps towards me.  I don't know what's really going on.  All I know is that this is scary.  They take another step towards me and point towards the back the gas station and say, ""Hey little girl.  Come back here.  There's a dead dog back here.  You should check it out.  Come on.  Come back here.  You'll like it.""  I manage to squeak out a, ""No,"" before getting my hands on the bikes, mentally preparing to ride away.  They take a couple steps again towards me, ""Hey little girl.  Come check it out.  Just come back here.  Trust me, you'll like it.  Come on, just come back here with us.  There's a dead dog.  Here, I can come get you and bring you back here to show you.""  Then one of the teens took a few more steps towards me with his arm out.  

Thankfully, VERY thankfully, just as the the teen extended his arm, my brother came back out of the store with our stuff.  I told him about the teens, but when he turned around to see them they had disappeared.  I don't know who they were, where they ran, or what they were really going to do to me.  My brother and I hopped on our bikes and got the hell out of there.  That is a scary memory that has never left me.  I was a little kid.  Truly creepy.

1353207631.0	13dr5a	I Nearly Got Raped By a Creepy Lesbian	PantheraLupus	247	78	84	"**Gender: Female**            **Location: FNQ, Australia**            **Age at time of story: 14**

Well, I'm going to give you a bit of background information first. When this particular incident occurred I was fourteen and a bit depressed. Well, pining after a guy who was a few years older than me, and therefore out of reach (this went on for a fair few years, I tend to try to avoid the subject). On top of this I had been bullied my entire school life. So I spent a lot of time in deep thought.

I live in a beautiful place with rainforest encrusted mountains. It's always raining and it's just wonderful. So every afternoon I would go for a nice long walk in the rain, always the same way. It was peaceful and would allow me time to think. Often when I got home I would add another chapter to the novel I was writing.

Almost every time I would go for these walks, there would be a girl in a school uniform in front of her house. I recognised her as a girl in the year level below me at my school. She was quite tall, well built but not bulky. Fairly plain features.

Well, one day I was going for my walk as usual. It was raining heavily and I was soaked. And there she was, as usual. She normally gives me a wave and watches me intently, yet for some reason this never freaked me out. This time she gestured for me to cross the road and speak to her.

""Oh! You're soaked! You should come in and have an orange juice."" She said, ""You'll catch a cold!"" 

I initially turned her offer down.

""Well, at least come and sit on my patio with me until the rain slows down a bit!"" She says. At this point I decided I would do the polite thing and accepted her offer.

I didn't feel creeped out at this point or anything, I was just nervous my stepdad would find out I was at somebody's house, which wasn't allowed and he had an uncanny way of finding things out.

So we sat out on her patio and talked. She offered me orange juice again but I declined. I'm not exactly sure why. After a few minutes of talking she asked me again if I would like to come inside. I agreed.

Bad fucking move.

She led me to the kitchen and again offered me an orange juice. I declined yet again and she insisted. Growing a little suspicious I declined a little more firmly. So she got herself a drink.

She then said she'd like me to stay and watch a movie with her.

""Okay, but I can't watch much of it. I have to get back home very soon. My stepdad will come looking for me if I don't.""

So she closed all the doors and windows and shut all the curtains, turning all the lights off in the process.

 We sat on the couch to watch ""The Cat in The Hat"". I was really uncomfortable with the entire situation by now. I think I only watched fifteen minutes of the movie before I jumped up and claimed I had to go because. My stepdad would go ballistic if I wasn't home soon.

I went to the front door and tried to open it. It was locked, and could only be unlocked with a key (it was an old house). Getting a little freaked out, I went to the other door to find that locked too. Again, it required a key.

What. The. Actual. Fuck.

That bitch had locked me in.

Starting to feel panicked but not showing it, I went back to the front door, I'm not sure what I'd gain by this but my panicked brain seemed to think that this door would be magically unlocked. No luck.
I turned around, and there she was. Right behind me. Smiling.

""Can you let me out, please? Can you unlock the door?"" I said.

Wordlessly she showed me the key, dangling it from her hand. I reached for it and she snatched her hand back. Then she dangled it in front of me again. I tried to snatch it out of her hand but she was quicker than me. She chuckled, and stuffed it into her bra, spreading her arms wide and saying ""If you want they key, you'll have to come and get it.""

""Ew, what the fuck, I am NOT reaching into your bra!"" I said.

I turned back to the door, trying to open it. When I turned back around she came towards me and tried to kiss me. I threw my arms up and she grabbed my wrists. We wrestled like that for a few moment and she let go of me, smiling. I was getting really freaked out by now but it hadn't clicked 100% what she wanted.

""Come on, come and get the key,"" she purred. 

So I tried to get to that key. I had had enough of this shit. But she tried to kiss me at the same time so the end result was more futile wrestling. By this time she was the one closer to the door, and now she had a crazy look in her eye. I did not like this. Not one fucking bit. She came towards me, and I automatically slipped into the fighting stance that I had learned in my Tae Kwon Do lessons. I had made it not every obvious, I had just placed my feet I'm the stance I had been taught, turned my body and my fist I brought behind me and not at my hip. (I don't remember the exact stance so excuse me if I'm wrong, I only did a few lessons and that was five years ago, around the same time this happened).

She noticed and she actually laughed at me.

""Hahaha! You think your martial arts bullshit is going to do anything? Alright then. I like it rough. Just no face blows.""

She launched herself at me but again this was for a kiss, and I grabbed her wrists this time and tried to push her away. She seemed to be enjoying this though. She slowly pushed me backwards. (I'm a rather slim individual, I don't have much power or weight unless I work out and I'm too lazy to keep that up for long). Inch by inch she pushed me back.

I was straining, trying to r resist her but she was bigger and stronger than me. The back of my leg hit something and I fell over backwards onto the couch. She jumped on top of me and went crazy, trying to grope me and kiss me. Pretty much instantly I punched her in the face and managed to kick her off, sending her flying into the wall. (That was my only advantage. My legs were strong as fuck).

I took the advantage to spring back up. By now I was just angry as all hell. 

When she got up, she had blood all over her face. She brought her hand to her bleeding lip, anger and delight, a strange and unnerving mix, on her face.

""I told you not the face."" She said quietly.

""JUST LET ME THE FUCK OUT OF YOUR HOUSE BITCH OR I WILL BURN YOUR FUCKING CUNT OFF!"" I screamed at her. 

""Oh, fine then but you still have to come and get the key yourself.""

So I marched up to her and grabbed the key out of her bra and got out the door. She followed me outside. This place had a high fence so we were hidden from the road. It was then that I spotted her poor dog. The poor darling was completely emaciated, and it ran up to me all excited. I patted it on the head and turn around to her.

""And feed this fucking dog. The poor thing is starving. Feed it or I'll call the RSPCA.""

""I have some meat inside for him. Can you help me cut it up? I have a sharp knife but I can't do it myself."" She said. Okay that was fucking creepy.

""Fuck off, you sick bitch. I'm going."" I said, and promptly noped the fuck out of there and went home and cried my eyes out.

I never told my parents.

I arrived a day early and decided to hit the bars to have a few drinks and meet some new people. I asked a 30 something year old happy looking dude on the streets if he could recommend me one and he said to just follow him as he's meeting his friends for drinks and I could join him. We arrived at a sports bar and had a good time, dude is a doctor and he tells us about patients doing stupid shit to themselves and how he saved their lives in the ER. As time passed more and more of his friends left until it was just the two of us. I was about to call it a night when he started asking if I have a girlfriend and if she's any good in bed. I told him that I do have a girlfriend and that I'm happy with our sex life. Now here's the kicker. He looks straight into my eyes and asks me if I ever had a guy suck me off. I'm stumped and before I can say anything he tells me how ""guys do it better, they know how it feels you know"". I told him that I'm neither cheating on my girlfriend nor am I interested in him or any other gay sex. He insists on picking up my tab, I tell him goodbye and head out the bar.

1333846404.0	rylp5	[My] First Job	hollidazed	190	18	13	"About 10 years ago, I was 16 and at my parents insistence, I got my first job. It was at a pizza and sub place that had just added a creamery. I started out as the ""front counter girl"" but quickly trained on all the different stations. They needed more help, so I got my best friend at the time to apply and she started working there as well.

One of our managers, Steve, seemed to take a liking to us. He was probably in his late 30s, early 40s and seemed nice. He would ask us questions during our shifts about school and things like that, nothing too personal, and often told us about his daughters. I think there were 3 or 4 of them, ranging in age from about 4 to 16. The oldest was living with another relative, though he never explained why. The others would come into the restaurant sometimes, and if I remember correctly, one of them had a birthday party there. 

After we had been working there for a few months, he started calling us both into work to do tasks such as cleaning the chair legs in the dining room. He also had us stay really late one night because some money had gone missing and he thought it might have been thrown away. Looking back on it now, I see it was totally ridiculous but it was my first job and I was relatively naive. 

Soon it started escalating even more. There was a Chinese restaurant nearby and Steve would go and get us meals during our shifts. He would also bring us little trinkets, like cheap earrings. He would offer to buy us cigarettes and alcohol and also offer to give us rides home since neither of us had cars at the time. He drove one of those big vans with no windows in the back. We never took him up on his offers. 

One day we walk into work and another manager tells us that Steve has been fired. When we asked why, she showed us a flier that she said someone had brought in after eating in the restaurant the week before. It was a sex offender flier. Apparently when his oldest daughter was a bit younger, she had a friend spend the night. He brought them both to his bed and raped them. Her friend told his parents and Steve was arrested. Since our restaurant was near a school, he wasn't supposed to be working there. He also wasn't supposed to be living at his house with his daughters. He had taken a liking to me and my friend and there's no telling what would have happened if we had accepted a ride from him. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1372709981.0	1hg5t4	"""Snow"""	BarfQueen	195	27	35	"First off I want to apologize in advance for any spelling errors. This is my first time trying to do a self post on mobile. 

I've told bits and pieces of the story to people before, But I don't think I've ever shared the whole story in one piece. I also have to apologize for some of the details being a bit blurry to me. This is for two reasons: a) People may have lied to me about some of the circumstances, and b) Drugs were involved. 

For the record I'm male at the time of this story I was about 15 or 16. 

So when I was a lot younger, maybe 13 years old, I got mixed up with a few of the wrong people and we started experimenting with all kinds of drugs and doing all kinds of illegal things. This all culminated in one summer in junior high when I realized I was going down the wrong path and so got away from those people. 

Fast forward to my freshman year of high school. I got a random message on MySpace (haha remember that?) From one of the people I used to hang out with. This girl may very well have been the most fucked up out of all of them. I actually had a long history with her, we went all the way back to kindergarten. She liked to come up with names for herself that she thought made her sound edgy. At this time she was going by ""Deathcake"".

Anyway, Deathcake told me that she wanted to catch up and that she had gotten herself together. Apparently she had just gotten out of rehab and was having a welcome home party. Being silly and young I thought she must really have it together, so I figured why not?

It turned out this party was really just me, her and two other people. One of the other two people was a guy I never met before. He told me his real name but also told me that he would like me to call him ""Snow"". Alright, sure. I'll go with that. These people just like nicknames. Nothing weird about that.

Snow says he's 18 and spends most of the night making passes at me. I'm polite but clearly not interested. Everything in general is getting weird at Deathcake's house, And I'm starting to get a little uncomfortable. I started getting my stuff together to leave when Deathcake begs me to stay just a little longer. I figured fine, I guess the least I could do is celebrate her soberness with her. And then after that I never have to hang out with her again.

Now, Throughout the course of the night, I saw Snow pull Deathcake aside to talk with her privately. In the beginning it wasn't really suspect, But a few times I noticed whenever he pulled her aside sometimes he would look directly at me while he spoke with her. Okay, BarfQueen, stop being so paranoid.

Deathcake brings out what she calls ""herbal"" tea. God damn, I don't know how I could've been so young and stupid to drink that tea. That was the last thing I remember that night.

Next day I wake up in my living room. I figured we must of had some drinks or something like old times. Got carried away. They drop me off and I let myself in, and yet another night of getting away with some illegal fun.

The day after that I started getting messages on AIM from someone I never remembered talking to. He was very nice and kept referring to himself as my secret admirer. Mind you at this point I still really didn't remember anything from that night.

So this guy keeps messaging me saying really nice things to me. I was actually kind of flattered. Three or four days after that night at Deathcake's house, he tells me he has a present for me. He tells me to check my email. Five minutes later I check. 

There, in my inbox, are 3 pictures of a naked guy. I realize I've seen his face before. I also realize I've seen his penis before. It's Snow. Suddenly details of that night at Deathcake's house start coming back to me. Then I freak out and realize exactly what must've happened to me. 

Now before anyone judges me for not immediately going to the authorities, let me just say that I knew if I told anyone that all of the details of my past illegal doings would have also come up to the surface. Wasn't about to let that happen. 

Instead, I figured that I would just never have to see this guy in any context again. So I kindly just told him to fuck off and leave me alone.

And just when you thought this is going to be a simple date rape story it gets that much crazier.

Snow leave me alone for another few days. Then I get a text message from a number I've never seen before. 

""I love you""

Now who the fuck would send me that? I figured just leave it alone don't reply.

""I love you""
""I love you""
""I love you""
""What we have is special""

All I can think at this point is ""nope!"" Still I'm hoping he will eventually wear himself out and forget about me. 

Now I have blocked his instant message account, so I got a shock when a new one starts messaging me. Except instead of words it's numbers. And pictures.

30""

Then a picture of a rope.

34""

Another rope.

I'm sure you can imagine the bricks that I shat when I realized he was quoting my pant size. Then all of a sudden something cracked in my head and I went full out berserk via instant message. I told him to leave me alone and that we'd never be together, especially considering that he sexually assaulted me. He told me if I wasn't going to cooperate he would just have to lock me away so I could be his forever. This is when I finally threatened him with calling the authorities. I gave him a whole bunch of stuff about how I have family in law enforcement (not true but whatever) And if he ever tried to lay another finger on me I would stop at nothing to see him rot away in prison for the rest of his life. Turns out this was surprisingly effective. I expected him to become more threatening, But instead he seemed more sad. Like genuinely sad. But obviously I wasn't going to try to comfort him. He started saying all this suicidal stuff, which I just ignored until he stopped. Once he stopped, he never contacted me again. 

I heard three days later from one of the people who was there that night that he had killed himself. 

A few months later the same person told me that he attempted to kill himself but survived the attempt and was now in an inpatient facility. 

This same source also told me that once he got out he was coming for me. 

This is the part that I had mentioned earlier, Where I said I wasn't sure what to believe. The person who told me all of this was completely unreliable, a drug addict, and Had a history of terrorizing people in our high school. Who honestly knows what actually happened to Snow? I certainly don't. I haven't heard from him or about him from anyone since. 

These days I'm a lot less terrified. I'm almost 22 now, and for the most part my mental scars have been replaced with the ability to smell a creep a mile away, which has helped me help friends out of similar situations. So there's that.

Anyway thanks for indulging me, /r/letsnotmeet. It's been therapeutic, to say the least. 

TL;DR - Some old druggie ""friends"" help some creep drug and likely date rape me. Days later he messages me with my pants size and pictures of ropes telling me he's going to lock me away. "	t5_2t3t8	True

The police said they'd look into it. This afternoon they contacted us and said that they'd done all they could, but because 'nothing' had actually happened there wasn't much they could do. Apparently they can't do anything until someone is actually hurt, which is stupid if you ask me.
         
Also, turns out the kids were a little more aware of what was happening than we gave them credit for. The one who I was holding woke up screaming about 'the man on the train' and telling us she didn't want him to take her away. We were freaked and didn't want her to be permanently scarred, so we contacted a child psychologist who said that this is normal and that she might have nightmares for a while, but she probably won't remember anything in a year or two."	t5_2t3t8	True

The group of girls wanted to get across town which takes hours by foot because we live in a rural area and none of them had a car at the time. Being young, naive, and unaware of the danger my aunt and her friends decided to hitchhike home.

 After a while of walking and trying to flag down cars a man stops to pick the young girls up. My aunt said that the man was very handsome and had a great smile. He was as sweet as can be so she and her friends got in the car. He drove them to their destination, gave her a smile and a nod and continued on his way. 

I am not too sure how much time had passed but she said she was watching the news one after noon and she saw a familiar face. There was the man who had given her and her friends a lift home. He was arrested for raping and murdering a large number of young women around her age. His name was Ted MOTHER FUCKING Bundy. My aunt never hitchhiked again.

1372979664.0	1hntf1	Sanrio Surprises, indeed. (NSFW?)	playcat	215	44	63	"This is my first post ever! So, dear readers, please forgive its length. 

In the summer of 1998, I was 11 years old. Just a little pip of a girl, with glasses and pigtails. I grew up in Los Angeles with my single mom (also an L.A. native) who is incredibly pop-culturally savvy and also has a great sense of humor. She has always loved Howard Stern, so I was basically raised listening to bizarre and salacious stories of human sexuality and deviancy. At 11,  I was just beginning to contextualize all these words, like ""horny"" and ""bukkake"" (haha, no, the latter came later. No pun intended!). I wasn't sheltered, but I wasn't overexposed either, until the day a stranger decided to change that.

That day, my mom and I went to the mall with my friend Alexis and her mom. We split up, and my friend and I went to Sanrio (the Hello Kitty shop). It was very popular at the time. We thought it would be a nice, safe spot for us tender young girls to stay while the moms went to Bloomingdale's. Not today.

So, Alexis and I were browsing enthusiastically, excitedly making wish lists, oblivious to anyone else in the shop. We met in the middle, by this huge display of candy, looking at all the fancy pens. Suddenly, we both became aware of a large, chubby, HAIRY middle -aged man in the store with us. It didn't-HE didn't seem right. He didn't look like a dad. He didn't look like he was shopping for someone at all. He looked like he was on the prowl. 

He was wearing grotesquely tight bike shorts, and an ill fitted faded blue tank top which barely covered his pudgy gut. His hair was a frizzy mess under a wool cap, like the one Brian Johnson from AC/DC wears (sorry Brian). He stopped pacing around the store as soon as he realized we were staring at him. There were three main aisles in the store, and we were standing at the front of the middle aisle. He sauntered about halfway up the aisle, and then abruptly squatted as though he were looking at something on a low shelf. Suddenly, his monstrous-looking cock sprang out of his shorts. It was thick and purple- almost angry looking- and so fully exposed that his wrinkled scrotum almost touched the pink carpet.

This was the first full grown cock I'd ever seen. And it was terrifying. The man was leering at us menacingly and he spread his knees wide, squatting all the while. We'd been frozen all this time but suddenly we snapped back, turned on our heels, and ran!

We found our moms and told them what had happened with that creep, and we went back to the store. The fucker was still there! He literally made no effort to cover himself up. I think the shopgirls were too frightened to say anything. My mom flipped out, and security escorted him out to wait for the police.


There's no real conclusion, only this. I will say that I'm not afraid of The D as a result of this incident. I also went back to Sanrio, because no one keeps me away from my fancy pens!

Tl:Dr: A pervert at Sanrio makes a ""huge"" impression on my friend and I and my badass mom saves the day.

1360730730.0	18fdvr	Barefeet On Concrete	pbandcocksandwhich	204	33	24	"Alright.
Well, here goes. I was 17, a female and living in rural Texas. 

So, one night I'd gotten into a fight with my parents, which is pretty normal. Anyways, I normally calm down from these things by going outside to my driveway, sitting in the boat we have parked out there and looking at the stars. I can do this for hours: if you've ever seen a Texas night sky in the country, you'll understand why.

Anyways, I was out there long enough for my dad to fall asleep and my mom to head off to some party. This is all pretty normal for my crazy Texas lake summers. Anyways, I'm laying out there, no lights on, with the garage open at my back. It had rained earlier in the morning that day, but that had cleared up in the evening, so now the air was thick with humidity, and sweet, and exactly how I like it. 

Anyways, I'm just laying there, really at peace with everything, finally having calmed down and rationalized after the fight. And then a noise comes out of the darkness, right behind me.

You know that noise that barefeet make on concrete? That weird slapping noise that you can just identify from memories of 17 summers running across concrete with no shoes? Right. I heard that noise, out in the dark, around 1 in the morning when the only person outside was me. We live in a neighborhood, but the houses aren't too close together, and there are no streetlights.

Anyways. 
My heart stopped ,pushed it's way into my throat. And then I heard it again, and it made me sick to my stomach. Something, someone was behind me, with barefeet in my driveway. And the only thing behind me was my garage, so whoever it was, they'd been in my garage. 

Then it hit me. I'd been out here for hours. I hadn't heard a damned thing, and I'd walked through the garage to get to my boat nook hide away. Whoever was there, they'd been in my garage for hours, watching me, waiting....for what?

I couldn't breathe. I remember the stars above me blurring into weird pinpricks of light because of the tears I was fighting back. I couldn't move because I didn't want them to know I heard them. At this point, I desperately started telling myself it was my over active imagination, I was mistaken, I  had heard a cat, something, anything...Or maybe it was just my sisters? That's it, it's my sisters, they are trying to fuck with me! That must be it!

I began to really believe that, internally convincing myself, still not moving, because something in my body knew that idea wasn't right. 

And then it happened again, just two steps, two slaps of bareskin against hot summer concrete. For some reason, this made me snap.

I jerked myself around, looking behind me, ready to scream at one of my sisters. Except, instead of an 18 or 15 year old girl, a man was standing there. Or rather, the silhouette. And this man was tall, easily over 6'4. (I hung out with basketball guys and got to judge height pretty well) 

At first, he just sorta stood there, this tall dark shadow and I could feel something coming off him in waves, something dark and menacing and my heart just stopped again. I couldn't breathe, I couldn't do anything but stare into his shadowed face and somewhere deep inside me I felt some part of me shrivel up and choke. 

He moved suddenly, and I could breath. I inhaled to scream, and then he was gone, running down the side of my house, and I'm just sitting in this stupid boat in the middle of my driveway in the dark screaming my stupid little head off.

My sisters came out after a few minutes and laughed at me, not believing my story and prevented me from waking up my redneck father with his collection of 24 firearms. When my mom finally got home, she and our family friend ""Big Al"" checked out the side of the house. 

I'll never forget the look of horror on my sister's faces as they shined the flashlight into the mud on the side of the house and found large footprints, toes and all running down the side of the house.

To this day I still don't know why this guy was in my garage, how long he was there, why he suddenly came forward, or what made him run away. 

Needless to say, this isn't the worst thing that has ever happened to me, but it is the only story where I 'got away.""

I was rushing for a frat back in uni. I attended their a few of their rush events. Everyone was a dick, but I didn't mind bcos I just wanted to party and have fun. One of the upper classmen was a real dick though.

So generally, I'm fine with slapping a guy's ass, cock-knocking someone, purpel nurple, etc. Joking bromance, I'm good for. But this guy was a complete creep. Three guys from the frat came to my dorm at 2 am and made me do push ups in the hall way. I was annoyed that they had come to my dorm just to embarrass me, but nothing creeped me out until the guy SHOVED his dick on my face and started to hump my face. It took me like 2 seconds to get out of the push-up position, but for the first time as a male, I felt violated. They all laughed and left eventually.

Things were okay for the next two weeks until I met the SAME guy in my DORM bathroom. He lived on the opposite side of campus, but he was taking a leak in my dorm bathroom. It didn't really hit me though until afterwards. I walked by him and took a leak. He came into my stall and kicked me forward (i never close my stall doors). Before I could turn around, he gave me a ""one thousand years of death"" (fingers up a guy's butt as a joke) through my shorts. I'm also normally fine with this as long as I get revenge and its a friend, but given the situation and person, I was fucking horrified. And the worst part was that he didn't stop. He shoved it up for a good four seconds, and I was propped against the wall trying to keep my balance and in utter shock that I couldn't move away.

I eventually yelled ""fuck off"" and throw a punch at him, but I hit his shoulder instead. He just stared at me and walked in closer. He's a lot bigger than me too. He puffed his chest and hovered over me, then got his hand and flicked my nuts. He left with the biggest smile I've ever seen, and I leaned against the stall door for about five minutes crying...

My take on frats. I know that not all frats are bad, but this completely ruined my idea and image of a frat.

1338701411.0	ui96k	Pizza Prostitute	gatorfan8898	194	22	30	"When I was 19, my parents came to visit me during one of my college breaks.  They stayed at a Holiday Inn, which was surprisingly rather nice given that it was located in a seedy section of town right off of I-95.

After a day of doing various activities throughout the city, we retired to their hotel room to order some pizza and watch some amazing basic hotel cable.  After some quality time spent with the folks, I grabbed the left over pizza, and walked to my truck which was only about 20 yards away from their room.

I got into the truck and started her up, ready to head back to my apartment, when I was greeted with a quick knock on the window.  It was a middle aged white woman who was a little weathered looking.  I rolled down the window about halfway, and she started with one of those fake ass stories every panhandler/bum starts off with... the kind where you immediately start tuning out after the first few words cause you know it's complete and utter bullshit.  I cut her off, blurting out some excuse to why I couldn't drive her to the gas station (at least I think that's what she needed).  She took it surprisingly well, then saw the pizza box sitting in the passenger's seat.  Her eyes brightened and asked me if she could have a slice.  I told her no, that I didn't have much food (and this is true, I was a poor college student) and that I loved pizza.  She then licked her lips, and told me ""if you give me a ride to the store and a slice of that pizza I'll suck your dick"".  For whatever reason I was completely flabbergasted by this random comment, and all I remember doing is grabbing a fistful of change out of my cupholder and basically chucking it at her, and driving off.  Not sure why I reacted like that lol.  To this day, almost 8 years later, I'm still reminded of this encounter because I have a squeaky noise when I roll down my driver's side window because a coin got lodged in there when I threw the change.

I still laugh at it today, because given the proximity of my parent's hotel room, they could've stepped out at any time and would've seen their son being solicited by some hooker who gives out bj's for pizza.

1329096208.0	pms5f	Stabbed in the neck.	EMT_guy	199	30	49	"This happened two nights ago. I was dating the love of my life, and things went wrong. We broke up, and decided to see other people. I was on the 3rd date with a girl that was really into me. She wanted so much, but I just couldn't find it in myself to give that to her. Soon, I'm moving... and every time she said something cute, I looked up expecting to see my exgirlfriend. For some reason I felt we just didn't click.

Time to leave. I tell her it's been great, talk to her later, but I just don't see this working out. I walk to my car, get in, and drive a block away. Red light. I stop, and moments later I see a figure in my mirror running up to my car. The moment I went to hit ""lock"" on my door, the door flies open. A lanky Portuguese fellow is standing there, and tries to grab my arm and pull me out of the car.

I resisted. I threw a punch, which landed squarely on his nose. The next thing I feel is pain, and see his figure disappear into the night. I'm bleeding. I have a pocket knife in my neck. I frantically called 911, and texted my ex about what was going on. I don't know why, other than she was the first thought in my mind. I thought I was going to die.

On the way, and when we got to the hospital, I was bleeding, coughing up blood, and blood began to ran from my nose. Turns out he missed my jugular vein by 2 centimeters, and hit an angle just perfectly enough to avoid my trachea. 

I'm extremely lucky. Other than stinging and pain from the wound, I am completely fine."	t5_2t3t8	True

She has a really bad habit of trusting the wrong people and ive always known ive had to watch out for the people she lets around but this just slipped through the cracks. After much argument with my mom she convinces me to trust this man and lets him live with us.

 Fast forward a few months everything seems normal, they fight every so often. Usually a lot of yelling, given they were both alcoholics this is expected. He helped pay bills and helped around the house so everything seemed fine. He would be out very late at some times but I didnt care at all.
 One day im watching the local news and see this man in the news who looked a lot like him, it was for a heinous crime. For whatever reason I initialy dismiss it and go to school. Later that night my mom sits me down to talk and I knew it just then.

 He was accused of running over a women with his pick up truck walking home from work after unsuccessfully trying to pick her up. He then got out and tried picking her up but was scared away by a bystander. The man got his plates and the cops traced him back TO MY APARTMENT and arrested him. He was a sex offender who failed to register for many years and was seeking refuge in the same place I am suppose to seek peace.
  
  Needless to say my mom is much more cautious as am I. We talked extensively and this eventually led to her becoming sober."	t5_2t3t8	True
1361652578.0	193gvy	First serious relationship ends with restraining order.	kaleidoactive	196	27	18	"I graduated from high school in 2009. At the time I was working at locally owned grocery store as a cashier. All of the cashiers were girls, and all of the stockers/bag boys were guys. I remember one day a new guy started, and I thought he was so cute. I flirted with a lot of the guys (they were all around my age) and I specifically started paying attention to him. He seemed really young, had somewhat of a baby face and freckles. Once we started talking, I found out he was 28-- ten years my senior. However, having just graduated from high school, living in my own apartment for the first time, I decided to go for it.

We started dating, and it got serious very quickly. He was a talented drummer and bassist, a seemingly very caring and passionate individual, attempting to get his undergrad degree at 28 in music while supporting himself. I felt sorry for him in a lot of ways; he'd been raised by a single mom who never gave him the love and stability he needed. He had pretty severe ADHD and had dropped out of school after repeating the 9th grade twice. He'd had a really rough start, and was fairly emotionally immature for a 28 year old. I had never spent so much time with someone and given them so much of myself, sexually, emotionally, and mentally. He was basically a wreck in a lot of ways and I tried to help him as much as I could, being an 18 year old at the time, and still living off my parents.

We dated for about 8 months, spending every night together. The longer the relationship progressed, the more jealous, possessive, and protective he became. He needed constant reminders that I was interested in him, and questioned every interaction I had with other men. For example, I had a close friend that lived in his neighborhood and I walked to his house from my ex's one day. Thinking that I had been gone too long and was most likely having sex with this other guy, my ex literally runs down the street and bursts in the door of my friend's house, out of breath and demanding to know what's going on. For some reason, we kept dating despite the growing jealousy, at least for a little while. We had great sex, honestly, and that's what kept naive me going.

It wasn't until he flunked out of college and was faced with having to move back in with his grandmother that I finally threw in the towel. I felt it was getting too intense and didn't want to keep dating him anymore. My parents hated him and he had creeped out most of my friends at this point. But of course it was hard for me to let go, I still felt close to him, and like I said, the sex was great and hard to leave. He seemed so pitiful after I broke it off, showing up at mutual friends' houses while I was there, texting me sad things, etc. It was hard to distance myself. We had sex a few times, and then I finally cut it off. 

This is when the creepiness begin to really set in. I had moved back in with my parents, and he showed up unannounced at their house more than a few times ""just wanting to talk"" to me. I had a crappy car at the time and the passenger side door didn't unlock from the outside, so I left it unlocked a lot. I began to find teddy bears, bouquets of flowers, cards, weed (we were stoners), etc, left as gifts. He texted me constantly, drove past my house at night to check if I was there. If I wasn't he would call incessantly until I answered; if I didn't he would leave nasty voicemails.

I started casually seeing another guy, a friend of mine from high school. One night I was at his house late, and somehow my ex tracked me there and made a scene in the parking lot outside my friend's apartment. He was screaming that I was a slut and a liar, how could I break his heart, etc. My friend's roommate went outside and subdued him and he eventually went away.

A few nights later, I was working at my current job (waitressing at a pizza place). My ex came in while I was working and started a scene with me in front of everyone, yelling at me and calling me names, etc. My managers escorted him out and told me he was banned from coming in there again. When I clocked off I had someone walk out with me, but when I got to my car he had keyed the shit out of it. There were lines up and down the sides of the car and he had scratched the word ""slut"" into the windshields and rearview mirrors. It was extremely upsetting and embarrassing. Of course I went home and told my parents about it. My dad is a criminal defense lawyer and called up some cop aquaintance of his and asked him to go talk to my ex. For some reason it was like there was nothing the cops could do about it except ask him to stay away from me. However, the abusive texts and hateful voicemails didn't stop; they got worse. The phone company couldn't block him from sending me messages, apparently. He hacked my Facebook. It was getting unbearable.

Being 19 and still stupid, I decide that if he thinks he really loves me he will stop harassing me if I confront him like adults. I go to his grandmother's house to see him while she's not there, and at first we just talk, but it became it an argument quickly. He told me he had cheated on me with a mutual aquaintance while we were together and had contracted herpes, and given it to me. I slapped him, and he grabbed me by the hair and pulled me to the ground and proceeded to try and choke me out. I just remember pulling his hair as hard as I could, screaming and biting, and finally squirming away and running out the door. He ran after me and I got in my car and locked the door. It was so scary seeing him pull on my car door, crying and screaming at me, and I tried to get my shit together and pull away. 

About 2 weeks later I got my restraining order against him, good for 10 years. He didn't even show up to the court proceedings. I have seen him from afar a few times since then, but thankfully it is three years later and I haven't heard from him whatsoever. Also he didn't really give me herpes. I'm glad it's all over now. Thanks for reading, it felt good to write.

TL;DR: When I was 18 (22 now) I dated a guy 10 years older than me for a few months, when we broke up he got all creepy and keyed my car, then tried to beat me up. I got a restraining order against him and haven't seen him since."	t5_2t3t8	True

Today has been more healing than any amount of therapy. I have the support and audience I've needed for so long. Now, I'm going to give you one last tale and some evidence.

Here is Brian's mugshot. The first day I saw it, it gave me chills. He's not sad, depressed,scared...no. He's smirking. This was a game to him, an inconvenience. He has no regret whatsoever. He's thinking of ways to get out of it.

Another redditor mentioned that he searched me and found my old myspace... I have a picture of little me holding one of the baby bunnies. It's most likely turkey in the photo. 

http://i.imgur.com/9vxyoAJ.jpg

Now, onto the story. I have a sister, she's 8. I chose to leave her out of the story, because when anything would happen, she was either out with my mother or too young to remember and in her cradle. Much like my mom wasn't involved, she wasn't. Brian has a fascination with her. He wants custody of her, and knows he can't have her.

This happened 2 months after he went to prison and weeks after the restraining order didn't pass. He was filled with this arrogance that he could get away with anything. He was convinced he could take my sister.

Now, my sister hasn't been abused. She's desensitized, and has watched me get hit multiple times, but was too young to really understand, and it became more of a hindrance on her, but she was relieved when the parents split up, and she wanted to stay with my mom. Unfortunately, they weren't officially divorced yet. And Brian thought he deserved custody.

I'm in the kitchen, making spaghetti. I haven't seen Brian since a brief glimpse in court, when he was laughing to himself as I told the judge about the night I called the police, and began to cry in the courtroom. (The judge had to tell Brian to stop laughing, disgusted.)
Rachel is playing on the back porch with her dolls. I hear her singing to herself and the porch fan is on, spinning. Then, I hear a voice. Well,I thought I did, but I assumed it was Rachel playing with her dolls, making them talk. 

This was the night before we were leaving town to stay with my grandparents and get away from Brian. I posted about it on facebook- my mistake- and a lovely girl named C'arrah from his church was still on my friends list, for some reason. It was stupid. I should have known she would have told him. I could have stopped this from happening. She tipped him off that we were leaving. Anyway, I heard a distant whisper.

I shake it off and keep cooking. 

""Rachel. Rachel come here."" I freeze in absolute terror. 

""Unlock the door."" 

""Daddy?"" 

""Baby, come open the door.""

I have never felt my heart beat so fast. I wasted precious seconds trying to pretend it was my imagination.

I whipped around but by the time I got to her, the door was flung open and Rachel was gone. It's about 11 at night, pitch dark outside. I hear Rachel holler far across my backyard. Naturally, I scream for my mom and take off in her direction, running as fast as I can, barefoot in the cold wet grass. I finally see her, and he's dragging her backwards and her feet are dangling behind her. 

I've never ran so fast. I run, run, nearly jump the fence and see Brian holding Rachel and starting to grab her shoulders because she's resisting. I finally catch up before he spots me, and yank her away from him, and see his car parked down the road- engine still running. Rachel breaks free from us both, and I scream something along the lines of ""CALL THE POLICE, JESUS CHRIST SOMEONE CALL THE POLICE"" 

At that exact moment I made eye contact with Brian. The last words we exchanged crossed my mind... ""You're going to prison."" and ""I'm going to fucking kill you."" I felt pure terror... but a wave of determination. In that moment he sprinted after Rachel, and I took off too. It was like we were racing, and she just wanted to go back inside, but it was so much bigger than that.

I reached Rachel first, of course. Brian barreled at us, and lunged at me, trying to grab my hair- which I had cut, nice try- as I desperately evaded his grabs at me and Rachel, running backwards towards the house. Rachel was mumbling to herself and bawling- ""I want to go I want to go"" and not quite understanding what was happening. In her mind, her daddy was just visiting her and we were having an argument. But I had this sinking feeling if I let her go, I wouldn't see her again.

I tripped, and fell on my back at one point while countering Brian trying to wrestle my sister away. I heard her yelp and I knew he had snatched her up, and I scrambled to my feet to see her fighting back, shouting at him to leave her alone. He looked hurt, but he wasn't stopping. Rachel took off running to the house, and I quickly squirmed to try and trip Brian to give her a few precious seconds. She got away, inside, and slammed the door on him. I ran around to the front door, where my mom was on the phone calling the police. 

Within the 5 minutes it took for them to get there, Brian had pulled his car out front, and was calmly leaning against it. He told them, ""I just wanted to see my daughter before she left. Now they're lying and saying that I tried to kidnap her."" The policemen believed him, but told him to stay away as we had a large trip to go on in the morning, but allowed him to walk inside to say goodnight to Rachel. 

In addition, he picked up my kitten. If you've read part 1, you should know why this sends shivers down my spine. He sat my kitten back down and commented that it was ""malnourished,"" stared right at me, and left. He will never change. 

He's still out there, and he knows where we live. We're supposed to move soon, but it's not soon enough. One of my former friends from church informed me that Brian knows where I work, too. I don't know how he found out. But this needs to end.

EDIT: Now a message from Brian himself, an email. I hacked it shortly after the court date. This was to his lawyer.

""Judge ordered:
no contact to chelsea ****** only
cannot reside at residence
I have been away from home for three weeks and two days. Chelsea is homeschooled and I am her legal teacher, she is finishing 9th grade and just turned 16. I also have a daughter Rachel who is 8 and although her mother usually does the teaching due to depression I have been her teacher for a few months before the arrest due to my wife not coming out of the bedroom before 4 p.m.daily. I have had to be a mother and a father to both daughters for 4 months due to my wifes bipolar and depression. I do all the shopping, teaching, cooking, take them to church and activities. It has been a burden on all of us. I have been counseling for months with many pastors, elders, counselors, and outside professionals as to this situation and the stress it has caused. I have sought advise repeatedly with Maria *** the head of Dept of Child and Family investigation division Head of **** County for many months as to handle all situations legally.
My daughter Chelsea had a speech impediment therefore we homeschooled her for years, trying to prepare her for regular school for the first time next August. She was frustrated with being at home although she has many activities outside the home. She became very exasperated last year with an eating disorder ,possible Bulimia ,then as her best fried died from an eating disorder she recovered but remained disturbed. Her activities at church helped including singing at the church. Her band leader 22 year old male was giving her rides to and from church, then it became times other than church and was accused by the pastors as having an inappropriate relationship with her and demanded that he not text, talk or give her rides. She became very upset with this and threatened Brian her father she would lie and get him kicked off the youth leadership at church and put him in jail for controlling her or telling her what to do.  

**((NOTE: In Florida, sex laws are 16 to 24. So this relationship would be legal. This is also not what happened at all?))**
She became repeatedly violent and verbally abusive to the whole family causing much stress to everyone.
When she was out of the house everything was peaceful but upon returning home she was spiteful and physically violent with all family members, also spewing cuss words and slamming doors. She would also leave the house and sometimes have no accountability about where or with whom she was with, stating she is 15 it was none of her parents business. She was well behaved at the **** Library where she is Teen Board President and works very hard and is very popular and respected. . Also at (Church name) she was very involved. Because of her rebellion at home she was asked to step down from all leadership until the family issues were resolved. This made her very hurt and spiteful to all involved. Especially father Brian. **((Why is he referring to himself like that?))**
In Counseling with her Youth Pastor and close personal friend of Brian, He was asked to interceed at a greater level .Because of her temper tantrums and violent outbursts on everyone Chelsea was asked 
to meet with the Pastor. Because she stated there had been in the past issues he was forced by law to 
call child services. Agent Carmen ***** interviewed the family once in April. She said and said she would contact in thirty days. After that the Pastors asked Chelsea to step down and started the counseling with Brian and Chelsea separately. 
May 15, 2010 the parents and eight year old Rachel were having a quiet night at home. Brian went to the store to buy Chelsea a new tire pump, upon returning he heard a fight between wife Chelle and Chelsea complaining of having a migraine headache with Chelsea cussing in front of Rachel. Brian asked nicely for her Chelsea not to be violent to her mother and not to use the f word. He then asked Chelsea, who had gone into the room, for his laptop because he had been working there earlier due to the fact that they share it as an office and a bedroom for Chelsea. She was not responding so he opened the locked door with a table knife and set it down then proceeded to enter and pick up the computer. 

He picked up the computer and bent over to unplug it and contact was made from Chelsea with yelling. As he turned and headed for the door there was contact but only to get out of the room. He says there was no intent to harm, but only to remove the work laptop since it belonged to a friend and it was a loner, previously she Chelsea had broken the three work and family laptops . He said the police told him if he had gone in to discipline her or spanked her it would have been legal, but if he shoved her it was illegal. Brian said he was just trying to leave the room , protect his friends laptop and get work done. After leaving the bedroom directly he was sitting in the living room with the younger daughter on his lap, Chelsea proceeded to come into the living room and throw candy at Brians face and accuse him of eating some. **He then stood up and Chelsea punched him in the face then spit in his face.** She then stormed off to her room and called the police.
Carmen **** from protective services recommended counseling from everyone involved. Brian has been in continued counseling thru the church but Chelly and Chelsea are reportedly seeking alternate counseling at this time. ""

So that is what HE believed happened that night. I'm confused reading it to this day."	t5_2t3t8	True
1356899592.0	15oqh6	"""Meggan"""	Me_without_You	221	55	90	"I met this girl through an old friend I grew up with, Mikey. I was dating his best friend that we also grew up with, Cam. Meggan was dating Mikey at the time. When I met her I immediately liked her. She was fun, energetic, and easy to get along with. A few short weeks after meeting her, I found out she had Leukemia. She said she had be diagnosed at age 16, she was 18 at the time. I was 19 so we had a lot in common. 

To shorten the story a tad, she was dating Mikey and, like I said, I was dating Cam. Shortly after we met, both of us couples broke up. Since I had grown up with the boys I was obviously still friends with them. She , on the other hand, wanted nothing to do with them. I thought. 

Fast forward about 2 months, she and I are dating at this point. (Yes, I like girls too.) I had talked to her best friend, Allysa, online and through text a few times before. She seemed pretty nice but I wondered why we hadn't met in person. She is the one that told me to ask Meggan out since she knew I liked her. Oddly, she didn't actually have a phone and the texting she did was through Yahoo IM. 

I introduced Meggan to my other friends at the time and they all seemed to like her well enough. I also found out more about her as time passed, of course. She was hypoglocemic, she had a crazy ex-boyfriend Skylar that beat her when they were together before, and apparently her dad was a ""molester"" and her mom was a crackhead. I met her mom and honestly she didn't seem like she was a crackhead at all. She was average build, had a decent home, and was a teacher for an alternative school. I wasn't one to question though. None of my business. 

As our relationship grew...so did drama. First, she had an episode where she found out she was pregnant, had a miscarriage, and was at the hospital alone. She said it was Mikey's baby. Oddly, she didn't call me to come help her even though we both lived a couple blocks from the hospital. I didn't even hear about it until late that night after trying to get ahold of either her or Allysa. Finally, Allysa ""texts"" me and tells me what happened and to just let Meggan be until the next day. So, I did what any good girlfriend would do, and I went to check on her and see if she needed anything. I just wanted her to know I cared. Allysa lived out of town and since Meggan's mom was a crackhead...I figured she needed someone. Nope. She wouldn't talk to me or even open the door. 

The next couple of days, things are quiet. No phone calls, no texts, nothing. So, I finally start getting more worried/upset. She starts talking to me and things start to smooth out. I forgot to mention that Meggan was obsessed with her computer. Just about everytime she and I were hanging out we had our computers right there with us. 

About a week goes by, all is well until I am at work one day. I get texts from Allysa saying I need to go check on Meggan. I start texting Meggan and I get pictures and scared texts from Cam. They are pictures of Meggan's arms all cut up...blood everywhere. Needless to say, I left work. Rushed right over to her house. She was already home from the hospital and all wrapped up when I got there. This is when I started getting mean texts from Allysa. 

I tried to take care of her the best I could but she wouldn't tell me what was going on so I tried to give her space. I was also a little upset with her too, honestly. She knew my best friend had killed him about 4 years prior and it was really hard on me. Self-harm is just not acceptable to me by any means. I didn't text or call in hopes that she would come around and open up to me. Instead, I got texts from Allysa saying that I should have been there for her and that she didn't think I was a good person anymore. Said she was going to tell Meggan that we should probably break up. Then here comes another friend on MySpace. I can't remember her name. She only wrote me about 2-3 times just asking about Meggan and I. Nothing like Allysa. 

Things smooth out again. We are at my best friend's house and all of a sudden she doesn't feel good. Said she needed sugar tablets or something. I rush myself and my buddy to the store to get her some.  I spent my last $20 on tablets, candy, and soda for her. I give her everything and she wants to go home. 

One day Meggan tells me she went to the doctor and they told her that if she doesn't get a bone marrow transplant that she probably doesn't have that much longer. The next day is her birthday and her mom lets us come over and drink. Meggan had asked me before not to bring up the bone marrow thing in front of her mom cause it made her really depressed. Well, we get to drinking with Meggan's other friends and her mom walks in. We do shots together and I start getting pretty messed up. I blurt out ""I will be Meggan's donor if I have the right blood type"". Her mom just looks at me weird and doesn't say anything. 

A couple weeks go by and Meggan is being more and more stand offish. I thought I did something wrong. So, I made a video for her and took it to her house. She acted like she loved it. Two or three days later I am at work again and she calls saying her car broke down at the store by our house. I told her I couldn't leave work to go get her because we were short on people but I would see what I could do. I get a text a little while later saying that she found someone that was going to give her a ride. She tells me later that she really thought the guy that helped her was cool and we should hang out with him sometime. I think his name was Chris. 

A few days later, she says she is going camping with Allysa and her other friend, I can't remember his name so we will call him Sean. I knew he was an alright guy and of course Allysa was her best friend. I get a text the next day from Allysa saying that Meggan had gotten raped by some guy up there and she needs me. I go to her house to check on her and she is curled up in bed crying. I try to talk her into going to the police and to the hospital but nope. I am at a loss at this point. I feel so bad for this girl and I have no idea how to help her. It seemed like if something could go wrong it would be to her. 

Another random day, she goes to the mall with Chris. I go to my friends in the next town over. I get texts saying shes scared and asking if I will please come get her. She wont answer the phone but she just texts. She says shes on the North side of town (that is a bad thing) walking by herself. I rush back to the city and shes nowhere to be found. Can't get her to text back still. I search everywhere. Finally, I go to her house to talk to her mom. Meggan is there with cuts and stuff all over her head and arms. Says Skylar saw her and him and his friends jumped her and beat the hell out of her in an alley. I'm furious so I find this guy* on MySpace and freak out on him since I have never met him in person this is my only way to get in touch with him. I ask him to meet me somewhere. I get a message back later telling me to basically fuck off. Then she tells me that Chris made her uncomfortable by taking her to one of his friend's houses and trying to touch on her. So, I asked her not to talk to him anymore. 

About a month later, I was getting ready to leave for basic training. I knew it wouldn't be too long. Everyone knew I had enlisted and was just waiting on a call. Meggan tells me that things are getting too hard at home and she is moving to Arizona with her aunt. Of course, I didn't want her to go but I knew it would probably be best for her. 

A week passes and I am at work when Meggan calls telling me she wants me to meet her at the air port to say goodbye. My boss, being as awesome as she was, lets me leave to see her. I get there and she introduces me to this Chris character. I knew him from somewhere. I couldn't put my finger on it at the time. She gives him a hug and comes and gives me a hug. I stop her and give her my favorite necklace. It is all glass beads and made specially for my sign. I hadn't taken it off since I got it as a present from my mother 2 years prior. 

She leaves and Chris and I walk out to the parking lot. I had problems with him since he had tried to touch my girlfriend but she forgave him so I let it go. As we sit down and light up a cigarette he asks how long Meggan and I had been friends. I looked at him confused and said ""We've been dating for about 6-7 months now"". He had no idea. I asked him if he had ever seen me before because I thought I knew him. We finally realize that he is the guy we used to call ""Jesus"" at my friends house. He supplied their weed. We get to talking and he tells me about when he helped her with her car. Apparently, her camping trip was with him. Only him. He drove her up to the lake to meet up with some friends and when they pulled up to the entrance she basically raped him. Just jumped right on him. I was pissed but obviously not at him. 

I go home and tell my mom. I start thinking about it all and how odd everything is. Nothing ever fit into place but I never asked questions. Now I wanted answers. I waited a couple days and she finally texts me from Arizona. Says she is having another miscarriage. It was from when she was ""raped"". All I ask is what hospital she is in. She says she is in a walk in clinic. 

Now, I don't know about everywhere else, but in my town and the surrounding towns...walk-in clinics are closed on Sundays..Right?

I tell her this and she gets pissed and argues with me. Then she won't talk to me anymore. I start getting more and more mean, scary, hateful texts from Allysa. Finally, I have enough and I drive to her house. Thankfully, her mom was there. She answers the door with a sad look on her face. I ask if we can talk a minute. She lets me in and we have a seat. I think her name was Brenda or something. 

Brenda: ""What's on your mind? Is it Meggan?""
I hesitate...""It's okay..What has she done now?""

Me: ""Well, I want to ask a question first. I just don't know if it is rude or mean"" she nods and I continue ""Does she really have..umm..Leukemia?""

Brenda: ""Wow, is that what she has now? That's a new one. No, honey, she doesn't. What else is there?""

Me: ""She's not hypoglocemic is she?"" (Nope) ""You're not really a crackhead are you?"" 

Brenda: ""That one really hurts but I have heard it before. No, I am a teacher, I can't do drugs and I don't want to.""

Me: ""Have you ever met Allysa or Skylar? They seem to be a little crazy""

Brenda: ""Well, they probably aren't real, honey. She has made up friends online. She makes their profiles up and writes as them""

(HOLY SHIT)

Me: ""Umm..what? So she has been sending me all these mean texts, lying to me, and lying to all my friends this whole time?'
 (Duh)

Well, you get the point. I found out everything. She was insane. Her mom told me the whole story on how Meggan did this to other people but I was the only one to ever figure her out and come to her mom. No one else had put the pieces together. I went home feeling relieved that I wasn't wrong with my suspicions but also scared that maybe she never really got on that plane. I told my mom what happened...I also had dreams that Meggan would show up at my house with a dead body cut up in a trash bag and tell me if I didn't help her hide it that she would kill me and my family. 

There is a lot more to the story. I don't know if anyone cares to hear it but I really don't have anymore time for it today. Just one thing, she contacted me about a year and a half ago. She told me she was sorry and asked if I wanted my necklace back. I was short with her and said yes. I gave her my P.O. Box and she said she would send it. A week goes by and I get a call from my mom. The necklace was shipped to her house. No return address. The weird thing is...I told her the address I have in Florida. She sent it to Arkansas...16 1/2 hours away. She also said she was still in Arizona...I have more to add if anyone wants to hear it. 

Sorry it's so long. I have never written it out before. Grammar &amp; Spelling are all kinds of jacked up. I have an Oklahoma education. Leave me alone. :)

1355632205.0	14xexw	The not-a-security-guard.	elfinette	197	30	13	"When I was in high school, my two closest friends were Collin and Eric. They were both tallish, skinny guys. I was a small young women who, as a sixteen year old, could pass for thirteen.

One night we went for a walk. Well, I was walking and the two guys were rollerblading slowly along. To get to my home we went through the middle school parking lot. The lot was at the front of the school, and a row of trees separated the lot and the road. 

Just as we entered the lot, conversation broke as Eric and Collin decided to race to the end. They took off. As I was walking, a car pulled into the lot and slowly drove up beside me. It was about ten o'clock at night, but the lights on the front of the school meant I could see the car pretty clearly. It was navy blue and it's back windows were tinted dark. There were no decals or anything on it, nothing that said ""security"" or ""neighborhood watch"".

The driver was a Caucasian man, probably in his late twenties. He didn't look overweight, but his face was wide and looked a bit swollen or something. He was wearing a red t-shirt, no uniform. He rolled down his window and spoke to me:
""Hey! You're not allowed to be here. You're trespassing.""

I was confused. I stopped walking and took a small step towards the car to hear him better. ""Pardon me?""

""I'm going to have to take you downtown. Get in the car."" 

Now, it was pretty clear this guy wasn't security or a cop, so I immediately put more distance between myself and the car. In a loud, firm voice said I said ""No."" The driver looked confused at that. I glanced  toward the end of the parking lot- Eric and Collin had seen the car and were skating back quickly.

He tried again. ""You're in a lot of trouble. *Get in the car!*""

""No!"" At that moment Collin and Eric reached me. I think one of them asked the driver who he was. The guy didn't say anything else, just pulled away and drove off. We three talked about how creepy that was as we continued our walk.

When I got home and said goodbye to the guys, I went inside and told my mom about the incident. She thought I was overreacting. I found the non-emergency number for the police and gave them a call. I have grapheme to colour synesthesia, which gives me a very good memory for numbers/letters. I remembered the driver's license plate and told the police. I don't know if anything came of it."	t5_2t3t8	True

This story is from when I was about 9 or 10 years old, so I'm trying to recount these events the best I can. It was mid-July, so I was off from school and attending a day camp during the week. I lived in a condo with my parents and older brother, but my brother was away at a sleepaway camp, leaving just my parents and I at home.

One night, my mom started to experience some excruciating pains in a section of her stomach. She's always been afraid of hospitals, so she brushed it off as a bug, but my dad saw through her act and brought her to the hospital at around 7 at night. It ended up being appendicitis, so it turned out to be a pretty good move by him. Obviously, they left pretty quickly, so I was stuck home by myself for the night until my dad returned. My parents had always been strict about the amount of time I spent playing video games and watching TV, so I naturally went straight to our basement to the gamecube and started playing Super Smash Bros Melee.

Quickly, I just need to tell you about our condo. It was on a hill so even though I was in the basement, we still had a back door down there. It was actually an entire wall of the basement that was a window with a sliding glass door to it. Behind the door, there was only about 15 feet of space before the fence and behind there was an even steeper hill.

As a kid, I was always paranoid about intruders in our house, so I had my gamecube set up so that while playing it I also had a clear view of this back window/door to see if anyone would try to get in. As I was playing, I kept glancing towards the window and thinking I saw some movement. Of course, I lived in a suburban area so there were many different animals that would run around outside, but not usually during the night. And since I was paranoid, it only took a bit of movement to get my attention, whether it was an animal or not. I was much too scared to actually go to the window or go outside to see what it was, so I decided to just go upstairs to the living room and watch TV.

I climbed the stairs still a bit shaken up from what I thought I had seen. I figured I would feel better in our living room though since the window in that room was also in the back of the house, meaning it was not on ground level, therefore no animals or.... people could ever be seen through the window. I collapsed onto the couch and flipped the channel over to Cartoon Network and started watching Camp Lazlo.

It was about 9 at this point and I was getting hungry since I hadn't actually eaten dinner yet. At a commercial break, I got up and went to the kitchen to find some food. Between our living room and kitchen was the front door and as I passed by it, I noticed that the door was unlocked. This freaked me out because I had been downstairs and I thought I might not have heard the door open if someone had come in. I convinced myself that nobody had entered, quickly locked the door, and continued to the kitchen. I grabbed some food and went back to the living room to watch TV again.

Just as I sat down on the couch and put my food down on the table, I heard a slight clicking sound coming from the front of the house. I jumped up and ran to the hallway so I could see the front door just in time to see the door handle jerking back and forth.

Someone was trying to open the door.

I froze for a minute, not sure of what to do. The door handle just kept moving back and forth, stuck in its locked position. Eventually, it stopped moving. Whoever was trying to open it had given up. Then, for some reason, I decided to run to the kitchen window and look outside to try to catch a glimpse of the person who had been trying to enter my home. I didn't get a good look, but I did see a man dressed in all black run away from the front steps to my house and down the street towards the woods. Something else caught my eye though; something the man was holding reflected the light from the streetlamp.

It was a knife.

Just always remember to lock the door at night.

1372585408.0	1hcwy5	Anyone wanna see my polaroids?	1piperpiping	187	23	10	"When I was younger I rode my bike a lot, and all over the place.  I grew up in the suburbs, so it was pretty safe to ride to most of my friends houses.  The coolest places to go of course were the small strip malls and convenience stores so we could blow all of our money on candy and soda.  One of the strip malls was kinda sucky but had really great dirt hills in the woods behind it that I'd go to with my friends.  We would try to ramp our bikes and do tricks and stuff on the dirt mounds for hours at a time (operative word being try).

After one such excursion with a friend of mine, we were getting ready to ride our bikes back home when we noticed a shoebox in the corner of the parking lot.  Being the curious little hoodlums we were (both 12-13, guys) we open the box.  It was a bunch of Polaroid pictures that were facedown in the box.  We wanted to see what they were, but the box was kinda grody (my friend had used his foot to get the lid off) so we just flipped the box over so the pictures would be face up.

After we flipped the box and kicked it off, we noticed that the box was full of Polaroid pictures of dicks (or a dick, wasn't looking all that closely).  They were close ups, and there were 50-75 of them now just starting to blow around the parking lot a little bit.  At this moment, a man comes out o a store, yelling.  We didn't really notice until he starts yelling at us.

""HEY!! YOU THERE! YOU KIDS LOOKING AT MY PICTURES??!?!""

Well shit.  He starts running over to us, so we hop on our bikes and pedal the hell out of there.  We get down the street a little ways and we hear the guy tearing out of the parking lot. We're freaking out a little bit at this point.  Bear in mind that this was well before cellphones with cameras or sexting, and both of us were kind of naive and it hadn't ever crossed our mind why a grown up would have or want pictures of dicks.

So this guy is following us, but fortunately there's a spot where we could cut through some woods where cars couldn't go.  We speed off into the woods.  The guy parks his car and comes running after us yelling.  He' alternating between yelling and telling us that it's ok if we want to look at his pictures.  We weren't so naive to not realize that a grown man offering to let you look at his dick pics was not ok.

We got to the other side of the woods and went home, still pretty shaken up.  I never saw the guy again.  We didn't tell our parents because we weren't supposed to be biking there and were worried we'd get in trouble and not be allowed to ride bikes anymore.  My friend though saw him one time about a year later in the supermarket or department store or something.  He said the guy stared at him until his mom went to grab something and then just slunk up to him and said, ""I know who you are.  I would have let you see my polaroids"".  Then he just disappeared."	t5_2t3t8	True
1370194264.0	1fj0fk	Always lock your car doors	Boom-time	193	22	27	"When I first started diving my dad would always ask me if I locked my door as soon as I got into the car. Every time I came home he asked me this. My dad at the time was on the S.W.A.T. team and had seen his fair share of crazies. This ritual continued after I got my first cell phone.
Skipping forward a few years, I find myself visiting a friend of my then boyfriend. He was a tattoo artist and on occasions would do some free work for his friends. My boyfriend at the time was in the middle of getting a piece done on his shoulder when the boys decided they were hungry. I volunteered to go as I was painfully bored and a bit hungry myself.
I walked to my car and climbed in. I decided to put in a new cd and was fiddling with my radio. I threw the car in reverse and started backing out and almost immediately saw him.  He's was wearing jeans and a black shirt, had the craziest look in his eye, and had something warped around his hands. I backed more until I had my headlights on him. He took a few steps back and sunk down on to the bumper of the car next to me, still staring at me never blinking. 
I look at what is in his hands and to my horror I realize he has a cable cord wrapped around both hands with a nice amount of slack in between, plenty for him to fling a car door open and grab a girl. Ample enough to wrap around someone's neck. He looked down at his hands and slowly lower them. The next thing I realize is I am screaming ""what the hell is wrong with you?!?"" Before speeding away as fast as I could.
Panicked I called my boyfriend and to him what had just happened. The boys ran out and ended up searching the entire apartment complex (it was rather small) and couldn't find a sign of the man anywhere, just the impression his butt made in the dirt of the car bumper he was sitting on. 
I called my dad later and told him the story, he then asked ""did you lock your doors?"" Yes, he had hammered it into my head, it had been the first thing I had done. Thanks dad. "	t5_2t3t8	True

It's a long read, but it's my first time putting this story into text, so hopefully you'll give it some time. 





I was eight years old when I moved from N. California to S. California. My recently divorced mother and I started our journey by staying with my mom's sister and her husband as well as their toddler child. My mom and I stayed in a room together in their home.Things were going pretty well at first, but then I noticed how mean and degrading my aunt's husband was being towards me. I hated him for this but could do nothing because..well I was 8.


I remember waking up in the middle of the night next to my mom and my aunt's husband was in the room. I didn't know what to think of it as a kid and simply dismissed it. He sat me down one time, being really nice to me and buying me ice cream and told me not to tell my aunt that he was in the room. Of course I said okay, but on another day my aunt had asked me if I noticed anything weird between my mom and him and I told her he's been in the room in the middle of the night. This is where the story started.

It became apparent that my aunt's husband was in love with my mother. My mother refused him completely, at least as much as she could. He became obsessed with her. At this time, my mother and I had moved out to our own place. He would call her and visit her while she was at work or wherever and kept finding excuses to come over to our new home.

Eventually, it kept getting worse as my mom refused him. He managed to make a copy of our house key and had broken in a couple of times. At this point, my mom put 5 extra locks on the door to keep him out. He then started to stalk her everywhere she went. One time he showed up to her work asking for her with a bouquet of flowers. The office staff had been notified not to let him on the premises and thus escorted him out via security. He waited for her to get off of work and was waiting by her car begging her to take him. When she refused, he physically assaulted her by grabbing her wrist and slapping her in the face. A coworker of hers heard some hub-bub and diffused the situation and he left.

My mom told me to stay away from him. One day at school (4th grade, 9yrs), I was waiting for my mom to pick me up after school. I was in the front of the school lot with my friend. He suddenly pulled up and told me that my mom and him are fine now and that she asked him to pick me up. I hesitated and I was kind of scared, but I went along with him anyways. Then I noticed we weren't even going remotely towards my house. We were parking in a Target parking lot and he called my mom on his cell. He told her that he had me and that he wouldn't let me go until she came down to talk to him. I sat there, ashamed of being played. She came and my uncle shoved me out of the car and she made me march to hers while they talked and argued. At this point, my mom came back to the car and broke down asking why this was happening.

My aunt finally got into the picture and it was time for him, her, and my mom to sit down and talk about this. They locked me and my toddler cousin (their son) in the next room where we could hear everything they were saying. I honestly can't remember what they were saying because my cousin had been crying the whole time. I found out recently (I'm 21 now) that after that had happen and my mom went to go smoke outside, he followed behind her and put a gun to her head. She begged and pleaded, saying ""I have a daughter, please don't do this"". He backed off and that was the end of that horrible night.

There were a couple nights where we had to stay at motels to keep away from him banging on our doors. The moment I mostly remember.. My mom pulled me out of school early, claiming to me that it wasn't safe for me right now. We rushed home in her car, him on the phone with her saying that he was coming over to end it. My mom was hysterical and begged again for him to stop all this. We went into our house, locked every single door and ran upstairs. From the window in her room, we can see the pathway leading towards our house. We watched him get out of his car and start walking towards our door, a large kitchen knife in hand. I was crying so hard while my mom was embracing me, crying as well. She was on the phone with the cops, yelling out the window that she had done so and after 10 minutes he ran off. Later on we heard that they had gone to his house and arrested him.

So after all this bullshit ended, more bullshit emerged. My aunt had begged my mom not to press charges, and tried to convince us that he's a good guy. Up to this day, she's still with the bastard. Most likely for financial purposes, but still.. really?They're still together, my mom and I are fine (of course with a restraining order) and haven't seen him since then (and they live 30 minutes away..)
Twelve years after that, the incident hasn't affected me much other than my great disdain towards anyone holding a large kitchen knife in my presence. No one else in our immediate family knew about our story. My cousin from a different aunt found out about 3 years ago when we sat her down and told her. My grandmother found out last year and from then on does not even mention his name. The one thing that kills me about all this is that my grandfather, who I respect and love more than anyone, has no clue and he loves the guy. He suffered a stroke about a year and a half ago, so we really haven't bothered to tell him.

P.S. I know it's a long post, but I've never written nor told anyone this story so I wrote as much as I could. Some details are still missing, but there isn't a lot of time and energy to put into it today."	t5_2t3t8	True
1348197320.0	108b5x	Thought I had just picked up a nice girl.  I had know idea she came with a friend.		209	46	32	"Scroll to the reformatted version below, it's easier to follow thanks to gerihtan!

A little long, bare with me!

So it was a friends 21st birthday and I had agreed to meet him for a couple drinks.  I was, I think, 21 and rather full of myself in social situations.  I spotted a cute girl and started dancing with her.  When she appreared to be into me I decided to drop my friend (because obviously he was a better friend than me) for the chance to see where things could go with the girl.  She seemed the rich college type and I was more of a punker/rocker type.  She suggested we get out of there and of course I agree.  Then she tells me she's got a friend.  Don't think I wasn't imagining sorrity friends, cause I was, when the oppisite emerges from the shadows of the club.  This guy was a large black man. Probably a few years my senior, did not seem unpleasant and I wasn't one to jump to conclusions over race.  She introduced us and mentioned they had just met that night.  We decided to get some beer and find a place to drink.  A little strange that neither one of themm recommended we go to a house or somewhere more public but I go along with it.  We split on a case and head to a secluded park.  At this point everthing was still fine but I made sure to choose the location because I knew the area and they did not.  If shit went down I had the upper-hand.  Behind this park ran some railroad tracks and it was a typical area for ""kids"" to drink/smoke etc.  Everything started out fine, though by this point my attention turned away from entertaining her and to the fact that this situation was just odd.  Why would they agree to come with me to such a secluded area?  This is not where sorrority girls kick it but she didn't seem to mind.  Rather she seemed to be having fun and he became a little focused on me.  I won't lie, at some point I thought maybe I was *his* sexual target.  Either way, things just felt off.  He excused himself to back to her car,100 yards away or so.  The minute he disappeared she started crying.  I tried to comfort her, asking ""What's wrong"", and the like.  Her sobs turn to wails and she begins to yell, ""Why are you doing this to me?!""  ""Why am I doing what to you?"", I say.  ""Why do you want to rape me?"", she says  ""I know that's why you brought me here, to rape and kill me...""  She goes on to say that I was with the other guy in some sort of plot to rape and kill her.  She is literaly losing it in front of me.  Don't worry, this get's better.  A train is coming.  She starts screaming about killing herself so that she doesn't have to suffer through our plan.  **She throws herself onto the tracks**.  To this day I believe she would have let that train hit her if I did not intervene.  I grabbed her feet and pulled her off the tracks.  The train passed, horn blaring.  She looks at me with a bloody nose.  She had hit it on the track I assume when I pulled her off.  She looks up at me, still sobbing, and says, ""Why did you hit me?!""  I am desperately trying to explain I saved her, not hit her.  At this point we cue the big black guy.  He is back from the car.  With a stick.  This stick really stood out because I was not familiar with the sport.  It was a [Field Hockey stick](http://www.google.com/search?q=field+hockey+sticks&amp;rlz=1C1SNNT_enCL356CL356&amp;aq=1&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod%3D13&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=hNVbULCQGpHK9gTOroHgAw&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=653&amp;sei=H9ZbUN3qFM3V0gHJ24HACA).  This is the type of sport to be played at a rich girls college but not the type of sport our buddy would be into.  I could be totally wrong on this, he could have very well gone to that school.  I digress.  He asks what's up and she points to me, still sitting on the tracks bleeding and sobbing.  ""He hit me!""  This is the point where I recall *fight or flight* like no other.  This, much bigger than me, individual start banging the stick on the tracks yelling that he's ""gonna fuck me up2, ""I done fucked up"", ""I'm *dead*"" he's, ""Going to *kill me*"".  I do the only thing I could think to do with two people losing their shit in front of me.  I lost my shit too.  I went fucking apeshit on him *and* her verbally.  I got real close to him and in his face yelling and screaming right back at him saying things like, ""Don't fucking start with me"", ""You don't know what she said about you"" etc.  I was close to him because he needed distance to deal a death blow with that stick.  I am in no way a fighter but felt my only way out was to confront him forcefully.  If I showed weakness I think he would have hurt me badly if not killed me altogether.  I don't recall her moving this entire time, just sobbing and bleeding.  After stalling him by getting in his face I knew my next move was to out as much distance between us as possible.  Grabbing my bag was a great excuse.  I made my way over to my bag, telling him to check on her.  He attention focused on her long enough for me to GTF out and head down the tracks.  The rest of the night was a blur but those two hours or so I will never forget.  People may ask why I didn't call the police.  Honestly I had a feeling they were in this together.  IDK.  Why would he have free access to her car and know there was a hockey stick in it?  Why would he come back with the stick?  Why would she flip the fuck out the minute he left.  IDK, I'm just glad I got out and truely feel I dodged the devil that night.

1370458737.0	1fqlrv	*I* Was the Creeper: Another perspective	tameimpalea	203	38	33	"I have never considered sharing my own story on account of this thread being predominantly about experiences *of*, not *as*, but I have encouraged by the earlier post and believe it to be cathartic for me, and hopefully interesting for you.


Last August I had begun classes at a new university and had leased an apartment with 3 other girls, potluck style.  The semester started of swimmingly: I was friendly with all of my roommates and enjoyed my classes.  I've had a extremely rough three years, which had admittingly made me VERY emotionally fragile, but I was ecstatic that life was finally going smoothly for me.  Sure, I was abusing my prescribed adderall and smoking weed a little too much, but people liked me!  My teachers liked me!  I was making good grades!  I was losing weight(thanks to the adderall)!  Finally, stability!  The stability didn't last long, however, and November was when the first incident began.

It was a Friday, and I was in my room after a smoke session with a friend, already sobered up.  The neighbors above us had always been notoriously loud, and there was excessive banging upstairs.  However, with the banging I began to hear muffled voices.  There were two: a male and a female.  The male voice was menacing and condescending, making the female voice cry and beg him to be quiet.  It only escalated after that, disturbing me greatly.  I tried to play music to cancel out the sound, but I couldn't shake what I had heard.  ""Someone is being abused up there"", I thought.

After some internal debate I decided to go upstairs and knock on the door, just to see if everything was alright.  Two girls answered the door, and I asked if there was anything wrong, that I heard banging and upset voices from my room.   They were accommodating and pleasant to my concern, and assured me that there was nothing going on.  I was skeptical of course, but acquiesced to their assurance and went back to my apartment, but not until I checked the third floor above me, just for good measure.  It was late at night now, and I still heard the voices.  I was confused, frightened, and worried about what I was hearing, so I called the police.  I made it an anonymous tip, but later I heard a knock on the door.  The police had come and the neighbors had told them about my visit earlier that night.  The policeman was incredibly understanding, and commended my concern, saying that domestic violence was heavily underreported.  He told me he had checked numerous apartments above me and there was no clues of potential abuse, but to call if I hear anything else.

I guess I took his request to call if I heard anything else a little too seriously, because after he left I still heard banging and the voices, now escalated to full blown rape, and called 911 again.  The same policeman came back and knocked on my door again, and again assured me there was noting amiss, and gave me his personal cellphone number if I heard anything else.  At the time I saw it as an act of kindness and genuine concern, but now I see it as not so much that as it was an attempt to get me to stop calling 911.  The abusive voices never stopped that night, and I couldn't sleep in fear and despair.

I want to make it clear that I have no history with domestic abuse or sexual abuse of any kind.  Yet this fact did not stop what I was hearing.  I tried to ignore it for a few nights, but that next Tuesday I was in my room studying for a big Chemistry test, and the banging and voices started again.  I couldn't take it anymore, and again went to the apartment upstairs, practically begging them this time to please be quiet, I had a test I needed to study.  They weren't as accommodating as before, and understandably were exasperated with this random girl that claimed to hear abusive voices in their apartment.  ""Have you watched any movies lately?"" They asked, and I left in a huff, starting to think that they were purposely keeping something from me.  

The voices became louder; I could hear them from outside the apartment now, when before I could only hear them in my room.  I started knocking on other neighbors doors, determined to find the source of the noises.  I circled the apartment building multiple times, looking into any windows I could, and even went into an apartment that had a partially opened door to look around and see if the voices got any louder from the inside of it.  I was at this point manic.  ""Help me!""  I heard the female voice wail over and over again, and the male voice repeating, ""Do you love me?  Do you love me?  Do you love me?  Do you love me?""

I called the police again, and this time they weren't as understanding as last time.  They got a statement from the people above me and warned me to not go up there again.  They left, and not ten minutes later came back to my door, claiming that the neighbors above me had gotten a doll with blood smeared on it at their doorstep.  Now this I did not do.  They of course did not believe a word that I said at this point, and looked around the apartment(from the front hallway) for ""crafting supplies"" and even asked my roommates if they saw me as a crafty person.  They finally left after now initial evidence, but not before giving me a card to a mental health ward and encouraging me to come with them for a mental evaluation.  I was insulted, not so much with their suggestion but their insistence, and closed the door swiftly behind them.

The next day I went to the front desk to ask if there were any people in the building with the names of ""Jacob"" or ""Kelly"", two names I heard from the voices that night.  There was none.

I learned to ignore what I heard, being to think that it was perhaps kinky foreplay of a rape.  My roommates as a result became more distant, and I became more withdrawn, smoking more and popping more adderall.  I later found out that it was a friend of the neighbors who did the doll as a joke, oblivious to what they were dealing with at the same time.

I truly wish the story ended there, but Jacob and Kelly were not done with me.  The next semester was only worse, where I completely lost my sanity, very likely scared one of my roommates out of the apartment and lost any remaining respect I had with my other roommates.  I don't want to make this single post a novella, but will gladly write a part two if there is interest for it.

Edit: I should have mentioned it before, but I am getting help.  I take medication and see a psychologist, and the voices and paranoid has been concluded to have been caused by the abuse of adderall and way too much weed.

1369844231.0	1f9xiz	The bus lady	OC4815162342	218	50	36	"My girlfriend and I are heading back to our uni after going out on a dinner/movie date. We always pick up chocolate frosties from Wendy's right before we get on the public city bus to go 'home'. Tghis night was different.

 The bus station, usually packed with college kids our age on a friday night, was strangely sparse, and quiet. We get on the bus with the 2 other people at the stop and sit in the front, by the driver, on the seat that are parallel with the wheels. Across from us was the very old lady. We didn't pay much attention at first because we were preoccupied with our frosties and the movie (Cloud Atlas, amazing, maybe my favorite movie ever).

 She was quite plump, wore a trench coat and had a bowler type hat on. Every time either my girlfriend or I ate a spoonful of frosty she would get this very sexual grin on her face. After a few minutes we both took notice. I, being army reserves and very self defense oriented, took out my knife and gave it to my girlfriend, just incase anything happens (I was much stronger than this woman, Im 6'6"" and 240lbs, but my girlfriend was not, so I'd rather her have the weapon).

Our stop finally arrived after about 15 minutes of this continually escalating creepiness. We, my girlfriend and I, disembarked the bus and began speedily walking to my dorm. About 100 feet after getting off the bus we look back and notice the woman following us. My dorm was on the corner of one of the quads, so trying to evade this woman, I go into another dorm, and start making evasive actions; climbing different stairs, taking the tunnels between dorms, etc. We come out of a side door and end up right next to my dorm, we think we lost her. 

We quickly get up stairs into my room and lock the door. I looked out of the window onto the road and I see her, on the bus again, riding away from the school. That was the last time we ever got frosities heading home again.

1344437990.0	xvt4x	I thought he'd finally gone...	haaappy	197	28	34	"Hey everyone! I’m a sucker for scary stories and have been watching this place for months. Absolutely love it! I think it’s about time I contribute a story that still gives me the heebie jeebies to this day. I’m from England but this story took place a couple summers ago when I was working abroad in Ayia Napa, Cyprus.

This one particular night, I had gone out after work and was heading home alone at about 3am to the apartment I shared with a friend. Silly to walk around by myself at night, I know, but I (used to) really enjoy walking around after dark. Now, if you’re a girl, as I am, you’ll know that walking around places like this, you get hassled A LOT by random men. It’s no biggie, they’re pretty much always harmless and over my time in Ayia Napa I built up quite a tolerance to it. The man who creeped on me this night, however, wasn’t the usual innocent sleaze. I was a bit drunk when this happened but I’m not sure being sober would have changed anything- creepers gonna creep!

So, I started the 5 minute walk back to my apartment when I faintly heard a man behind me say, “Hello. How are you?” over my music. Usually I'd breifly smile and say hello as I walk on because, even if someone's a blatant creep, I like to give people the benefit doubt and be trusting. There's no crime in saying hi to a stranger, in fact it's quite nice. On this occassion though, I just ignored it and hoped he'd notice the headphones because I was shattered, enjoying my beats and just really couldn't be bothered with it. I kept walking and heard the guy chuckle and say something like, “I’m only saying hello.” I thought to myself, he’s right, don’t be rude and so I turned my head to say hi as I kept walking. Big mistake.

The problem is you can’t tell which ones will walk on after a hello and which ones will take even just a smile as an invitation to chat more. This guy did the latter. He trotted over and walked beside me asking me my name, my age, where I work etc etc. I took out my headphones and coldly gave him one word answers (lies) so as not to encourage him but stupidly pointed in the correct direction to my apartment, although I didn’t tell him the exact name.

We’d been walking down the empty streets for about a minute and I started to worry that he would walk me the whole way home and find out where I stayed. I asked him where he lived and he told me the name of a hotel really near where I stayed. This was obviously a lie since he was definitely a local judging by his appearance, accent and poor English. Alarm bells started ringing in my head and I was quickly sobering up. 

Fortunately, I thought to myself, we would reach his supposed hotel before my apartment so at least he wouldn’t be coming the whole way home- we’d have to part ways a block before if he wanted to keep up his lie. We continued walking and he continued to ask more questions, walking closer and closer to me and eventually putting his arm around me. I pushed it off, asking him not to do that and tried to put some distance between us. He chuckled and kept coming closer to me as we walked. I kept looking around for other people but the streets were dead. He tried again to put his arm round me and ran his hand down my back as I shrugged him off. I was getting angry and really scared by this point and jogged to the other side of the road telling him to stay away. He kept his distance but continued grinning and asking questions which I no longer responded to.

By this point we were about 40 feet from the turn-off for “his hotel” and about 80 from mine, I could see it now at the end of the street. I power walked up until just after the junction and looked back to make sure he went down the turn-off. He stopped and smiled at me. As I walked backwards towards home I told him, “There’s your hotel! Why aren’t you going down there?! GO!” I think he knew I was aware he didn’t really live there and started to slowly walk in my direction.

I knew running would be futile because he was, well, a guy and I’m a girl who’s 5’2’’. I started power walking towards home, ignoring the, “Hey baby, come on!” from behind me as he kept pace just a few steps behind. I reached my apartment but still didn’t want him to see exactly where I lived and definitely didn’t want him to follow me into the dark car park. I turned around and told him in the most aggressive voice I could manage to, “Go the fuck away!” but he just stood there 10 yards away looking kind of hurt/ angry. This guy was one persistent creep.

Looking back, maybe I should have shouted for my friend in the apartment or just screamed but I think I didn’t because I worried no one would come and he’d get more angry. I was virtually in tears at this point and told him he was scaring the shit out of me and to please, PLEASE not follow me anymore. I began to walk past my apartment and looked back to see him turning around slowly, scuffing his feet. Finally he got the picture, I thought, and I kept walking and hoped that if I just went round the block, he’d be gone by the time I got back. I took the first right after my apartment and silently sprinted the next three sides of the block. I peeked round the next corner at my apartment. I couldn’t see him and so walked into the car park... and he was fucking there in between two cars smirking at me. I honestly don’t think I’ve ever got such a fright in my life!! I don’t know how he knew that was where I lived- perhaps because it was a popular place for UK workers to stay… I don’t know. I screamed and ran for my door which I pounded with my fist. My friend answered the door as I was scrambling for my keys and I barged through slamming the door behind me. Her boyfriend was there which was a huge comfort and after seeing the look on my face he ran outside as I hurriedly told him what happened but the guy was gone.

I never saw him again but I made sure I never walked home alone after that. Perhaps he didn't intend to actually do anything to me but I don't understand why any guy in his right mind would do that when he must have known how much he freaked me out...?! Not cool.

1342963768.0	wys2m	I'm Sitting Next To A Psycho	GravityBytes	211	42	67	"This is probably the second time I've checked this place out and finally subscribed. I've met many strange people during my lifetime and this encounter takes the cake.
This story has to do with a squatter originally from Wisconsin and I sat next to her on a greyhound bus to Huntington West Virginia.
To begin, I'm used to always getting a seat by myself because Pittsburghers are of their own breed. We don't like sharing seats with people who could intentionally kill us. Most anyone would agree that sharing a seat with a squatter is going to make you have a bad time. I was on the bus in no time with my laptop set and browsing the web of randomness when I look up and see this haggard woman enter the bus and look straight at me and the empty seat beside me, although there were plenty of other seats available. I tried not to make eye contact and shifted my weight as if to say no, both of these seats are taken. She didn't get the hint. I could literally smell her from where she was standing and there was no way in hell I was going to sit next to that for the next ten hours ... or so I thought. She decided to make a bee line straight towards me and plopped down, odor and all. She didn't even have enough courtesy to ask if it was taken or if she was bothering me. I was so pissed off; she could have taken the seat right across from me but I figured she wanted someone to talk to on the way down. I'm usually the nicest girl you'd ever meet but I don't fair well with people who have no manners, such as the new arrival. She began to introduce herself and I could see the dirt encrusted under her fingernails and what seemed like dried up blood around her lips. I was mortified!
I couldn't bring myself to shake her hand but I did say hello. I believe her name was Anna something, anyway, her clothes were as muddy brown as the rivers surrounding Pittsburgh and I knew something was up. She told me she was a squatter from an abandoned house in the south hills for two years, used meth, coke and became pregnant and that's why she was ""on the run"". The whole thing sounded weird. Why was she on the run? That's the only question running through my head when I start feeling the stabbing pains in my stomach from not eating breakfast before leaving. Honestly, I forgot about her long enough to reach into my bag and pull out a little bag of chips, in which I saw her gawking at. I felt horrible and decided to share them with her, even though the events of my trip were going to take a drastic turn. She polished off my whole bag and fell asleep, I, really examining her now, noticed a very peculiar gash in her neck. Why the hell was there a cut that size circling half her neck and why didn't I notice when she sat down. That's when I saw the handle of something in her bag. I didn't know what it was and my imagination ran wild. About thirty minutes later we arrived in Zanesville, Ohio and my nerves were at their thinnest by this point. I woke her up and told her that we were at a rest stop and she jetted off of the bus. Knowing she was gone and would never know, I took a better look at what was inside her bag. To my unfortunate surprise, it was a gigantic chefs knife. It had to have been at least twelve inches long and four inches wide. I then proceeded to freak the hell out!
Here I am sitting next to a homeless pregnant woman and she has a knife and gashes on her body. She didn't seem to right in the head as was; I started thinking about where she could have possibly gotten the money to ride the bus at all and everything clicked. Needless to say, when she got back on the bus I had finally moved my stuff to the back and made my nest there. She looked around for me but I dunked down until she sat down and finally fell asleep again. Coast clear, or so I thought. For a while I was listening to music and browsing the web but felt sleep taking over me. I didn't think it would hurt to doze off but kept seeing that knife in the back of my mind and was sure as hell not sleeping the rest of the six hours I had left with that woman sitting so close to me. I admit, I was paranoid but for good reason; I then hear the woman mumbling in her sleep and what I heard next I'll never forget. ""She'll die!"" I had just about enough and knew the homeless addict wasn't pregnant. She was insane! I got off the bus in Columbus and made my way towards my next destination and could see that the woman was running to the exit when security had stopped her. I, being nosey, got close enough to hear the conversation. Someone had called the police over her doing something before she left Pittsburgh. Via stabbing a man and taking his wallet. It was probably the person she had stabbed and once again, everything clicked. The gash around her neck was him fighting back and the blade was the weapon she used to take that mans wallet to pay for a ticket out of there. I knew something wasn't right the minute she told me her story. Police showed up and carted her away while I watched. My only thoughts at the time were that I could have been next. When I reached my destination I flipped on the tv at my mothers house to see if anything showed up on the news about it. Nothing. During my whole vacation, not once was it mentioned. I even went on the web to see if Pittsburgh news had reported about it, all efforts were useless. 
So now you know. Never trust anyone on a bus."	t5_2t3t8	True

One day My friend (john) went hiking with a friend from college in North Carolina. They planned to hike and camp out for a few days. As they began their journey they saw an elderly couple on the trails from a distance and just noticed that something wasn't right with them, but they brushed it off and continued on their way. As it got darker they decided that they should find a good place to set up camp. As they were doing this they heard a strange noise that was getting closer to them. They sat and listened quietly, as it got closer they noticed it was someone singing and old gospel/revival type song. By this time it was already dark and the singing got within 100 feet of them with no light coming from the noise. So someone was singing these creepy ass songs in the dark while walking through the woods, and then it quit. My friend decided that it would be best to not move and try to sleep right there. It was pretty cold that night and they didn't build a fire because they were so creeped out and didn't want to draw any attention to themselves. This area is filled with backwoods, possibly inbred, hillbillies to put it lightly, people you probably wouldn't want to have to deal with, especially if you've ever seen the movie ""Deliverance"". So all night they didnt sleep at all and every once in a while they would hear the singing or faint talking coming from different areas in the woods. As soon at it was light out (John)'s friend called his dad to come pick them up and they cut the trip short. A week or so after being home my friend was watching the news and there was a report of an elderly people that had been missing in the woods being found mutilated in the very area he had been hiking. Turns out some drifter on the run had killed them both. And my friend could have easily been killed as well. Heres a news [article](http://www.cherokeetribune.com/view/full_story/18018735/article-Drifter-pleads-guilty-to-killing-NC-hikers-in-2007?instance=secondary_story_bullets_left_column)"	t5_2t3t8	True
1341908348.0	wbi6c	A Dark Secret in a Small Town		195	28	63	"R/nosleep directed me here from a post that didn't fit in with the rest, and as I've spent the last couple of hours reading the posts, I figured this belonged here.

**Women! If you go out at night, don't let yourself/let others be left alone. Men! Don't let the women you know get stuck somewhere alone at night! If you know a girl friend/sister/etc going out, and she doesn't want you with her, at LEAST make sure you check in with her, and offer to come out/give her a ride, if she feels she needs it.** 

A couple of years ago (as of June 28th, 2 years, exactly) I was at the movies with some friends. Surrounding this theatre are a lot of nice stores and places to eat. All of it very well lit, except for the back side of the plaza. During the day, it's just a post office and a crap-ton of dumpsters. At night, it is a secluded, dark, creepy place that begs for something bad to happen.

In the are I live, there is a high population of people over 55+, as well as a very high population of people under 18 (families with young children, who have grown up in the area.) The city I live in, and the one this story take place, are the center of everything. The upper-middle class white families take stage here. Nothing to do for the teens besides go to school, walk to Del Taco, and go to the movies. In the cities surrounding, you have the 55+ in country clubs sharing space with the ghetto, gang-banger types. Mix in a few drug addicts, you have a typical Southern California community.

On this particular night, I was with some girl-friends. I was in a new, short, strapless summer dress (this detail will be important.)  We did our usual movie, and a few laps around the plaza. The other two are picked up, and I am left to wait alone. I walk around, not feeling any danger, (I've been there a thousand times, alone, and never worried) but tonight proved to change that notion.

As I walk around, I pass a man, who no doubt is a druggy (again, not an unusual sight in the area) but don't give it much thought. As I finish another lap and come near the end of the plaza, where the post-office starts up, I see the druggy standing against the wall. As I get closer, he stands straight to do, what I assumed, was to ask for a light (at the time, I was one of those innocent Christian girls, who didn't do drugs or anything, and was still a virgin.) He puts on hand out as I attempt to avoid him and not have to interact, but he steps in my path, and grabs me by the shoulder. I try to pull away and turn back toward the high concentration of people, until he dug his nails into my arm. I was ready to kick him in the nads and scream, until he showed me his gun.

I am frozen in fear. Unsure of what to do. I tries to make a sound, but nothing came out. He tugged me forward and grabbed me by the back of the neck and started walking me forward again. I walk with him, hoping someone would pass by and notice, but to no avail. We walk about 50 feet around a corner, almost past the post office, until he turns me down an alley. This is the area with all the dumpsters that is almost pitch black, with the exception of a dim glow from the street lights next to the post office. I am horrified and fear this is where I will die. But no. What happens next makes me wish it were.

I see him reach for the gun and pull it all the way out, and aim it at me. Instinct tells me to put my hands up. He tells me to sit down. I comply. He starts to undo his pants. I am still unable to speak. Unsure what to do, he gets on his knees and gestures me to lay down (less of a gesture, more of a pushing the gun I'm to my collar bone.)

I feel one shakey, rough hand reach up my dress, while the other hand holds the gun now aimed at my stomach. I feel him grab my underwear and hastily pull at them. I have my legs closed tight, until he presses the gun harder into my stomach. I put my hands over my face and begin to sob, as I ease my legs enough for him to do what he wanted. I don't look at him for the rest of this encounter, but I feel everything. He moves the gun away, I assume he set it down next to him. I then feel him pry my legs apart... Line up and penetrate me. I didn't know then if he did or did not wear a condom (today I know he did, because I've had other sexual encounters) and was in a great deal of pain. I was a virgin then, and though he didn't ""pop my cherry"" he still caused me an immense amount of pain. 

I know it couldn't have been more than 5 minutes from the point of him grabbing me, until the end. But to me, it was an eternity.

I assume he finished, or freaked out, because I finally felt him pull out, pull up his pants, grab the gun and scuttle off. I lay in shock and tears there until I hear my cell phone ring. It's my dad. He's infront of the theatre waiting for me... I don't remember it, but I had gotten myself up and walked all the way to the car. I didn't say a word to my father, and I feel he assumed I just had a fight with a friend, or was tired. Or just being a teen girl and not talking. But when we got home, I couldn't even get myself to shower. I just went to bed and sobbed into my pillow. I stayed in my room for almost a week. I didn't speak to anyone, or even eat or shower.

To this day, I regret that I didn't tell anyone. But about 3 months ago I saw the man who raped me. He was in the paper. He received a life sentence for the murder of some drug dealer. Part of me was relieved, part of me was angry. Though he could no longer hurt others, he had done enough by hurting me.

*8 months after the ordeal, I willingly gave up my virginity to a boy I had been dating. Today, I have long moved past what happened to me, and able to reflect upon it, and not let it define me as a person.*

My grand parents were up visiting us Lovecraft Countrians from Arizona for the summer because 80 degrees here is nothing compared to 120 degrees in the desert. They're all out on the porch smoking like chimneys and in general having a nice night, when someone's stomach growls and my mum, being a charitable spirit, asks whose stomach it was so as to fill someone's hungry belly.

""Was it you, Nana?""
It wasn't Nana.
""Grampa?""
Not Grampa.
""Robbie?""
It wasn't Rob.

Apart from those people, my mom was the only one left, and she wasn't hungry. So she mouths to Robbie, who is ex law enforcement, ""Get The Gun.""

My mum's first thought was ""animal under porch"", but that quickly dissolved upon turning and seeing a six foot tall figure disappear into the woods behind our house. A man. A full grown, white, male, was belly down under our porch *listening.*

So Rob returns with Grampa at his heels, both armed and my mom immediately discloses the new information--they chase behind the figure in the direction my mum pointed, eventually coming to a road/other residential area. They see a white SUV peel out, headlights off, down the road onto the main street and *gone.*

It was my dad.

Additional notes:

Parents divorced 3 years prior. Dad has an issue with personal space. He treats us like possessions he has a right to interact with, and gets off on power. To this day, after not seeing him for a while or declining a visit (due to work or prior engagements--he refuses to make plans) I'll come home to my apartment to find all the doors open and the lights on. It's a power play. He gets off on showing off. I'd change the locks, but I'm renting from my dad's father. I plan on moving in August--when I told my dad, he said ""well, I'm gonna miss you... I just might come with you!"" He wanted me to take it as a joke, but I know he's not joking. I'd actually welcome any advice reddit has; please just PM me. :P"	t5_2t3t8	True
1353717009.0	13owry	Unpopular guy at school threatens friendships in all the ways.	nowhesafurry	217	53	47	"I've never submitted anything before so I hope this goes through (how tired do you get of reading that?) It might be kind of lame and way too long but it scared me through most of my teen years and contributed heavily to my gun phobia, which I am now trying to overcome at age 20 (a choice inspired by reading this subreddit.)

So there was a guy named Ricky who went to the same school as me for as long as I can remember. I didn't know him, but I did know that he was unpopular and made fun of a lot for his social awkwardness and speech impediment. People called him ""retard"" more often than his actual name. It was sad to watch but I didn't know him and I was too wrapped up in my own middle school life in relative obscurity to do anything.

One day in seventh grade we had an assembly in the cafeteria, which was completely packed with only a few empty seats scattered around. When Ricky came in, everyone refused to let him sit in the empty seat next to them. Like I said, I didn't know him, but I had an empty seat by me and waved him over to let him know. He sat down and said ""Thanks, (my name)"" with sad and grateful eyes. I said, ""No problem,"" and turned back to my friends, kind of wondering when I told him my name.

After that he tried to talk to me a lot, and because I knew he had no friends I didn't turn him away. However, soon my friends would groan and roll their eyes whenever they saw him, because they knew he was going to come sit with us. They complained to me about it, because he really was annoying and the kind of awkward that is just hard to hold a conversation with... I didn't enjoy being around him either, because he just made things uncomfortable. I started cutting our interactions short and trying to keep an air of mere acquaintanceship, hoping he would get the hint and go find other people to hang around. It worked, mildly.

He stopped sitting with us but he still would stare at me or try to interact with me alone, and seventh grade me was just not having it. I got more and more annoyed, and would whisper and make faces to my friend Sarah showing this. One day we were about to go to class and he stopped me at my locker and said ""Hey (my name), can I talk to you for a minute?"" Sarah gave me a look and left. I said, ""Okay, but class is about to start."" Then he says, with a very serious face, ""I love you. Will you marry me?"" I got pissed that someone I barely even knew would put me in that kind of situation and demanded, ""What? What the fuck?"" He responded, ""I was just joking."" Needless to say, after that point I was no longer tolerant of him and was as cold as possible. He didn't like that.

Some time later, I was sitting with Sarah (who had some issues with depression and anxiety.) She exclaimed, with generous melodrama, ""Ugh, somebody just kill me,"" and put her face down on her desk. Later in the day, Ricky showed her a comic he had drawn depicting Sarah exclaiming, and in the following panels, Ricky pulling a gun and shooting her in the head. She came to me later with an appropriately ""what the fuck"" reaction (I mean, that kind of comic is inappropriate in any context, but I think it's even more so when the receiver knowingly suffers from depression as Sarah did.) We agreed that we should get the drawing and show it to a teacher. However, upon approaching him, he ripped the comic up and threw it away.

We ignored him completely after that. For weeks if he tried to speak to us, we would pretend to hear nothing and look annoyed, with all the expertise of the teenage girls we were. This continued until one day when Sarah and I were sitting in class near the end of the year, laughing to give ourselves something to do besides counting down the days until summer vacation.

Ricky walked into the room as we were laughing and, passing behind me, leaned over and said in a low voice, ""You won't be laughing when I have a gun in your face."" I was startled but had the curse of ""fake badass 'til you make badass"" and spat back without thinking, ""Yes I will, see you in hell, asshole."" He continued on his way and Sarah and I looked at each other, wide-eyed. We knew we should have reported him, but for some reason we were afraid and never did.

Fast forward to ninth grade, the next time I encountered him. We were in gym class together, and he would stare at me menacingly and generally make me uncomfortable. I started to regret not reporting him before, but felt it was too late. So every day I went to gym class, I felt more and more afraid for my life. He had anger issues and years of being bullied, and I was scared that as his ""only friend who betrayed and abandoned him,"" he would hate me the most out of all of his aggressors. I started to have trouble sleeping and nightmares about dying, and went to school every morning wondering if this was the day I would die. One day I broke down in the car and told my mom everything, and how afraid I was to be around him. The next day I was called to the principal's office to make a statement. Soon he was moved out of all of our mutual classes, and I never saw him again except very occasionally across an assembly hall or cafeteria.

People who knew what happened eventually mentioned that he did the same thing to several other girls throughout high school who were nice enough to extend basic friendliness to him, and had his classes moved at least one other time. Last time I saw him was in the crowded hallway of an anime convention being held at my college, dressed in cat ears and a fursuit.


TL;DR: Socially awkward object of bullying gets too attached and threatens me when I pull away from him, repeats m.o. with several other girls, is a furry now."	t5_2t3t8	True
1346114107.0	yxmsd	the strange government man		201	36	27	"I should preface this by saying that the man in which I came into contact was himself not creepy, but the situation in which he presented himself one night was very strange, to say the least. I had totally forgotten about this until I was reading something about the CIA (MKUltra to be exact) and suddenly I remembered this one night at work...



I used to work graveyards at a prominent gas station and convenience chain in southern California. Every so often, I'd say probably about twice a week, this well dressed, 40-something man would come in around midnight to buy some smokes and occasionally a beer. He was always dressed in business attire and almost never spoke a word. He seemed like a normal guy, except that he always seemed a bit tired, stressed and just generally annoyed with life. 


One night however, he comes in a bit later than usual and seems really bothered. He goes back, grabs his drink of choice, and comes to the counter asking for his usual smokes. As I'm ringing him up, he suddenly starts talking. ""You know, I do the same shit everyday? I go to work and I see shit... shit you wouldn't believe... and I can't say no because I have to provide for my wife and kids, but I can't tell them. I can't tell *anybody*. I mean you would not believe the stuff that I know, that I've seen, and yet I have to carry on day to day like nothing is wrong.""


 He seems obviously disturbed by something, and I desperately want to prod him for more information but I hesitate. He grabs his stuff and is slowly heading backwards for the door.


""Sorry to unload on you, but I come in here and see you all the time and... hell, I see you more than my wife right now! But this whole place is fucked. We're all fucked."" 


At which point he turns out the door with a solemn expression on his face. 


I saw him once more, when he came back into the store. He acted as if nothing had happened."	t5_2t3t8	True

Reading these stories has made me realize that for being so reckless as a teen I managed to make it by without too much danger.  That doesn't mean that I wasn't totally stupid as a teenager, I was, and I put myself in situations that could have been bad often.   This series of stories is from one of those times in my life.


A little background...when I was 16-17 years old I was dating an older boy (19-20) who lived an hour away from me in the next largest city.  He had family in my town and visited often, so it didn't feel like a long distance thing.  On top of that I was a resourceful kid who saved her money.....and then utilized it buying greyhound bus tickets and sneaking away for the weekend to see him.  I was stupid.


So all of these stories take place during those times, which spanned about a year.  I learned a lot about the greyhound universe in the process....



Greyhound Bus Story #1- The Stripper's Happy Family


This one isn't terribly scary, but kind of weird and funny.  While waiting for the bus to come in the lobby of the Greyhound building I was approached by a very smiley and bouncy blonde woman.  She was constantly smiling and very friendly.  She says hello, asks if I'm waiting for the same bus she is, which I am.  She welcomes herself to sit with me and begins rambling on about her life and what she's doing there. 


At first I was kind of playing polite but not paying that much attention...until I started to notice how interesting her story actually was.  Apparently she was a stripper in Los Angeles and she got fired because the bouncer and her fell in love and refused to break up to keep their jobs.  She, still smiling constantly, points her boyfriend out to me....he's the hulking, glaring, black man standing next to her luggage across the way.  I'm like....'um...okay.'  Not really sure what I'm supposed to even say, just nodding and trying to be polite.


Then things got fun.  She asks me if I have any change, and that we can pool our change together to buy a small pizza to split since the bus is going to be awhile.  This actually sounded like a good idea to me...I was hungry, and paying some change for several slices of pizza sounded pretty awesome.  So I give her my coins and she goes off to get the pizza.  When she returns she has her boyfriend with her, although he kept one eye on their luggage the entire time.  She also seems to have procured a large family photo album.


As we all start to eat she begins flipping through it and telling me about the photos.  This is not a normal family photo album.  The first picture is a picture of her and the bouncer boyfriend, in full strip club uniform.  She's holding a wad of bills in her teeth and grinning like crazy.  I'm like 'okay.'  Then she shows me a picture of her and another girl doing a show at the club, both of them dancing on the pole.  The next one was still them, but rolling around on the dance floor together, making out.  The next one was more graphic and included the bouncer.  She's telling me how this girl was like her sister, and how much she loved her.  Also, can I tell she's 5 months pregnant in this other picture?  The whole time I'm keeping a neutral face but on the inside I'm just tripping out over this couple.


The rest of the night wasn't terribly eventful, the bus came, we all got on, we left.  When I got off at my stop however, the woman yelled out to me from her seat, ""May all your dreams come true, sweetheart!!""  and I couldn't help shouting, ""You too!"" on my way out.


Overall review:  Nice couple, graphic family.  Whatever, at least they weren't trying to rape and kill me.


Greyhound Bus Story #2-Touchy McToucherson


  The usual, get on the bus, wait to get off the bus.  This time the bus was very crowded, but I managed to get a seat to myself....at least, until the bus pulled into a small stop along the way and five more people got on.  Unlike most creeper stories, this guy didn't single me out in an empty bus...there really were no other seats but mine, so while I'm not super happy I'm not really alert either.  I took my usual ""I don't want to interact"" stance, leaned against the window, with my walkman in hand.  The guy didn't really say or do anything...he was wearing a large, worn hoodie I remember, and his face didn't have anything about it that was particularly memorable.  Long story short, he wasn't acting creepy, and I let my guard down....and dozed off.


I think I only slept for 15 minutes or so, the bus going over a bump woke me up....and this guys hand was wrapped around my upper leg, working it's way...up.  I shot up in a panic,shoved the guys arm back and glared.  I have no idea why I didn't yell or alert others, but I didn't.  The guy seemed to have been spooked by my sudden hostility, and put his head back down.  


Then he started slowly scooting over.  He did it very slow, to where it took me a second to realize I was getting increasingly more pinned into the window as I moved over to avoid him.  Before long his hand started working it's way back over, lightly brushing my leg with his finger.  It's around this time I realize I'm going to have to actually do something, which terrified me even more.  I started scanning the crowd around me, trying to see if anybody nearby sees what is happening or could help me...everyone is facing forward, oblivious, except for one girl.  She was sitting one seat back, and across from me and she was watching everything.  We made eye contact and I tried my best at making the teenager, wide-eyed 'heeeeelp meeeee' face.


Just then the bus pulled in to another stop and a few people got out, including two people near us, leaving a fully empty seat.  The man's hand started to close around my leg and squeeze, like he knew I was thinking of getting up and bolting.  Just then the girl from behind me pops up right behind the guy and says loudly, ""OH MY GOD!!!  Finally I can sit with my friend!!  What kind of a crappy bus system is this, we haven't been able to sit together since we first left!  Come on, girl!!"" as she grabs my arms and actually jerks me pretty hard past the guy and into the empty seat with her.


I thanked her, she said it was cool, and like awkward teens we proceeded to ignore each other and listen to cds.  :/   The guy got off at the town before my stop, for which I was eternally grateful.  Ick.



Greyhound Bus Story #3- Don't Judge A Book By It's Cover 


Fun Fact:  On Saturday mornings convicts recently released from nearby prison would all get on the Greyhound to be taken to wherever they are going.  I usually took the bus on Fridays so I usually didn't have to experience this.


Then came the time I needed to take the bus Saturday morning.  I don't even remember why, I had some school responsibility to take care of Friday night that threw me off.


I remember stepping onto the bus and my first thought was, ""Shit, it's crowded."" followed quickly by the realization that all of the passengers were men, most still in those plain grey jumpsuits.  I'm a 16 year old girl.  Fuuuuuuuuuuck.


There's only one seat left and it's next to the most terrifying man I had ever seen at that age.  He was huge, basketball biceps huge, and has a full face tattoo of a skull.  I remember sitting down with a feeling of absolute dread.  


The man turns and starts to talk to me....it was hard to understand him at first, he had a very thick Mexican accent, but after a moment I realized he was asking me if I thought it was going to stay sunny all weekend.  I squeaked out a 'maybe' still completely unsure and kinda terrified.  Then it happened....he smiled real big, with all of his teeth showing...and it wasn't creepy at all.  Under all the ink that made his face horrifying was a genuinely happy, almost blissful, man.  I remember his eyes were big and blue and just...happy.  


As I started to relax a bit he starts to tell me how good the sun feels, and seeing the trees of the orange orchards.  How he feels alive.  Then he introduces me to the men sitting around us.  They're all very nice and polite....they ask me about school, they tell me to be careful riding the Greyhound (Hahahah!) and that I seem to be a good kid.  We even played fucking cards!  


I left the bus that day with five more friends, smiling and laughing together.  Go fucking figure."	t5_2t3t8	True

I changed my mind because I want reddit to know to always trust your first instincts, no matter who the person.

I was unemployed for 6 months, desperate for work, willing to do anything to get a good job. 
I remember me, my boyfriend and his two other mates were at the casino (there's only 1 in our whole state), after watching our mate spend all his money on blackjack we were ready to leave. Having a cigarette on the balcony a bald man came up to us and started a conversation.
He bought us a round of drinks and started bragging about all the businesses he owned (He looked about 39). 
He was a bit weird but he was buying us all drinks (we could not afford) so we didn't really care.

After he found out I was unemployed he jumped at the chance to offer me a job, giving me his card and booking an appointment for a trial on monday. Thinking he was a professional business man at the time I was thrilled at the idea of finally getting work, for once I thought I had some good luck and did not want to ruin my chances for the job by being too fucked up in front of him.

He then stated telling me he had the penthouse suite of the casino equipped with a spa and proper bar and invited me and our mates to go up there later to drink. We said we'd think about it and he went to the bar and came back with a round for us again.
At this point me, my bf and his mates were pondering whether we should take him up on his invitation to the 'penthouse' he said.

While I go outside for another cig, he follows me and asks me if I want to make $100 cash. 
Me: Umm what doing?
him: Just come with me to the front desk so I can book the suite?
Me: Um I thought you already had it? I'll just get the guys...
him: Get them after! No I said I only BOOKED it....I just want some company at the desk.

The desk wasn't far enough for any trouble to go down and I didn't want to anger my ""future boss"" so I agreed waited while he bought a suite, collected the money walked briskily back to where my bf was and told him what had happened.

Two hours later all of us are up in his suite drinking when he keeps making up bullshit stories about how he used to date runway models, all we could do is nod and not seem rude. 
He then asked us how our last drinks tasted, we said fine why? Then he told us he had put some 'crack' in it to keep us up all night!

THC, MDMA, DMT and acid are the only drugs I dabble in, NEVER CRACK! So naturally we were all fucking pissed he had drugged us!
1. We had only just met that night
2. He was well over 35/ IT'S fucking gross.
3. I was going to apply for the home open job monday.

That's around the time he took me and my bf away and asked for a threesome, we said NO and he just started talking about himself again.
By the time he finally let us leave (he wasn't shutting the fuck up no matter what excuse we came up with)
I found myself vomiting at 4 in the morning at the train station, surrounded by drunk aggressive Aboriginals, feeling like I was going to die from whatever he had slipped us.

He called me the next morning apologizing for his 'behavior' and booked a time to meet him at the job interview. My boyfriend had a bad feeling  about him and told me not to go, but in all our financial strife, the job sounded amazing so I decided to give it a try. (The 'job' was supposed to be me handing out pamphlets at home opens)

I couldn't find the address he wanted me to find so he told me to meet him at a nearby shopping centre where he got me to jump in his car and took me to the display home.

We got into the house and he started talking about the other night at the casino. I asked him to keep it professional, that's when he turned scary.
him: I bet you really wanted that 3some aye? Come look at this porno site! You look so sexy right now getting my dick so hard!
I felt sick and horrified at this point, I knew I was by myself, with a stranger In a display home, in a display village (where nobody lives, no one in sight), a stranger who kept telling me all the gross sadistic things he wanted to do.
Me: THAT'S INAPPROPRIATE! I have a bf! I want to go home, this has made me too uncomfortable, fuck your job take me back to my car.

He looked angry and started trying to CONVINCE me to touch him and started chasing me around the dinner table laughing (not happy laughter). My bf called and so I ran outside, lit a cig and stayed there until he came out. He dropped me off at my car, I asked for my resume back but he said he wants to keep it so I just left.

I told my boyfriend what happened and he sent an email to the head of the guys company asking if my 'interview' was actually legit and telling him what happened, turns out it wasn't. 
Never trust anyone until your certain of their credability.

A month later I recieved a call from him, he screamed down the phone that he was going to kill me, my bf and my family for emailing his boss. He told us bikies were on their way and we were fucked (probably got my adress from resume). The 'bikies' never came.

For ages I felt miserable, the only job I was excited for ended up getting me drugged and almost raped. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1339209242.0	usm3m	never riding the bus again.	toodalooKangaroo	182	21	19	"For some background info, I lived with my dad when I was fifteen for a while, and he lived on the opposite side of town that my highschool was on. So I had to ride 2 buses to get home, each being about 40 minutes to an hour long.

I had just got on the second bus, when I noticed a real grubby looking man come onto the bus. He was walking with a limp or something. Since the bus terminal I was at was downtown, and there's usually creepy people there, I didn't really think much of it. 
I always tried to keep to myself while on the bus, because I hated when people felt the need to talk to me. So I would put my headphones in, and play the music quiz I had on my iPod. When I looked up to see which stop the bus was at, I noticed the creepy guy had sat down right across from me, and was staring and talking to me. I instantly took out one of my earphones and paused my song when I realized he wasn't even talking. He was just mouthing words and making direct eye contact with me. I kinda ignored it and just smiled at him whenever I'd accidentally make eye contact.
Once it was my stop, I looked up and pulled the chord. Then once I glanced over at him his face had changed completely. He was now trying to make conversation by asking which school I went to and how old I was. By this time the bus had stopped and the doors were opening. And he was right behind me. Which is when I noticed he had pissed himself. 
I just wanted to get out of there at that point, so I walked off the bus, with him following. 
I tried walking faster, but then he yelled, ""you got a nice little body, i'd like to see what you can do with it.""
I took off running and didn't look back.
Once I got home I told my dad everything, and he assured me that the baseball bats he had strategically placed near the front and back entrances of the house would keep us from danger.

I woke up at like 3am because of police sirens, and when I looked out my window the police were hauling someone off in handcuffs. 
Since it was the rough part of town, I didn't really think anything of it, (probably because I was half asleep and an idiot).
The next day, my dad asked me if I heard what had happened.
He told me that there was a man, sneaking around our house, with a weapon of some sort. He was being loud enough for our neighbours dogs to hear him, so naturally they started barking super loud. The guy panicked so he decided he was just gonna kill the dogs. With all the rukus, our neighbours noticed this guy, and called the police. When the police arrived, he was still trying to get over the fence to ""finish off the mutts"". 
Thank god for those dogs. Because who knows what that guy would have done.

I still don't know if it was the same guy, and if the events were related, but I still think it's creepy as fuck, and decided to share."	t5_2t3t8	True
1330465188.0	qa9as	Hanging out and drinking with a murderer.	BlacktoseIntolerant	190	27	38	"So, I'll try to recount this as accurately as possible, but this happened 16 years ago and this isn't a story I share often ... but Reddit has a way of making you open up.    

My friend, call him ""Mike"", and I are at a bar one night with a friend of ours.  We're there with our friend Art ... older guy, we've known him for a few years from hanging out in clubs and shit.  We're in our early 20s and Art is in his mid 30s or so, but hey, we're all out having fun and trying to pick up chicks, so age isn't an issue with us.

Night comes to a close and Art asks us if we want to go to a party with him in West Chester.  It's about 30-40 minutes from where we are, but in the opposite direction of home.  There was no guarantee of how big or fun this party would be, so we politely declined and headed to the after hours spot near our house.  

  Fast forward a couple of days ... we read about a girl missing out in the West Chester area.  We joke and say ""Thank God we weren't out there!"" and let the news pass.    Fast forward another two years ... an arrest is made concerning the missing girl.

The girl?  Aimee Willard.  She was murdered and her body discovered a few days after she went missing.  The story made every headline in the area and, I believe, got some national attention.  In fact, the show *Forensic Files* did an episode about it.

   The murderer?  Arthur Bomar.  The same Art that Mike and I were hanging with **the night Aimee was murdered**.  Had we gone with him to West Chester, it is possible that we either would be in jail with him, or worse, I wouldn't be here typing this.

See, Art killed a man in Nevada and served 11 years for it.  When paroled in 1990, he moved to PA.  He was arrested for breaking and entering in 1998, and when apprehended, he was driving the car of a woman named Maria Cabuenos ... whose remains were found in March of 1998, and her murder had remain unsolved (and, still is to this day).  They linked his DNA to the Willard case, and ... conviction.  He still sits on Death Row today, I believe.

1370215847.0	1fjp4y	This is why I will always own a shotgun.	ehhnotsomuch	187	27	33	"Like most, I have reading these all day and wanted to share my story. It may not be as intense as others, but here we go.

Roughly 7 years ago, I was a skinny tall guy (14yo kid) with floppy hair and glasses. NOT intimidating in really any way. Typical midwestern suburb in the summer.

I was outside doing something near my car when I saw a Cadillac pull up in front of my neigbors house. Not thinking anything of it, I coninued whatever it was that I was doing. 

The (large) man began banging on their door with no answer since they were not home. Upon dicovering this, he noticed me across the yard. He asked me in a loud-ish voice if ""steve"" lived there. I assured him that no one of that name lived there. (true) He then began to walk toward me in an aggressive stride. 

I quickly put my hands up in a ""no contest"" manner and began backing towads my front door. As he approached, I made it inside and slammed the door locking it behind me. He began banging on MY door and yelling that he needed to speak to ""steve"".

After yelling that there was no Steve through the door, he turned around and walked back to his car. Thinking it was over, I rechecked the locks on the door and stayed on edge for a bit.  

Within a few minutes,  I noticed that he had circled the block and parked directly in front of my house this time and was on his way to my door. 

I began to shut off all of the lights in the house except for the tall lamp in the living room and grabbed the shotgun from my fathers room and loaded a single buckshot into the tube (not the chamber). 

within seconds, he was on my porch for a second time, banging and yelling about ""steve"". I had had enough.

I positioned myself in front of the bay window next to the front door and situated the light directly behind me. 

with one quick movement, I yanked the blinds open and we locked eyes. 

I cocked the shotgun without breaking eye contact.

The look on his face was something I will never forget and he backed away from the house and got in his car and left, never to be seen again.

Yes I called the cops, But was not able to get the plate numbers due to it being dark by the time I felt threatened."	t5_2t3t8	True
1359057622.0	177hx3	Brian; Murderer, Rapist, Jesus P2	chelseateach	198	38	38	"**Tl;Dr of Part 1: Brian poisons baby rabbits and blames me for the deaths of other animals, flashes me and locks me outside in underwear. But it gets worse.**

EDIT: Trigger warning to those who have been abused psychically, molested or mentally manipulated.

As I got older, Brian began to act weird. I feel like he didn't mature past middle school, and that was why he started acting weird to me as I was going through puberty. Harassing me and myself frequently seeing him naked, or him always coming into the bathroom when I was showering. 

I won't go into detail on his molestation. But as he was a chiropractor, he called himself a ""doctor""- so when I was 7, when I had fallen and hurt myself down there, he decided... he should inspect it. It had been a repressed memory until the end of this story, lucky for me.

We still lived with Jack, who was 70 something now, old, and very..very creepy. He would hear each of my screams during the routine beatings, and he never once tried to stop Brian. ""It's your family, it's your business,"" he would say.

I was a bit hefty at 13.  (5""0, 120 pounds) I wasn't allowed to have snacks as a kid, only meals, so when my friends started offering them to me at church I indulged. Brian thought this was disgusting, despite being overweight himself. 

This gives me a complex. 
He also interrogated me every time I'm close to a male my age at church, and even threatens them. It scared me, and the gleams in his eye were of absolutely evil intentions. 

Flash forward to 14. I'm a good weight now, (5""5, 110) and have friends at the library AND church. I'm getting to be pretty popular and people like me. While I'm depressed at home, I'm ecstatic outside.
 Brian doesn't like this. He begins to go off on me each day about how I'm fat, and nobody will ever love me- repeatedly grabbing my sides and face and legs whenever I was close and mocking me for being fat. Pinching whatever slightly-pudgy parts of my body there were.
When I begin to start running to lose weight, once a day, after dinner he mocks that ""That will never work.""

Of course, I got an eating disorder. I found myself throwing up food more than I found myself eating it- spending each day counting my calories, with no energy. The goals I had went away along with my energy. 
I stopped feeling anything, really. Each day was just me trying to get to the next. I lost the light in my life, even at such a young age.

 My best friend, Cyndi, who was 17, noticed this. At first she confronted me and told me I was beautiful and she'd love me no matter what. 
Unfortunately, I loved being sick so much, and even though I had dropped nearly 20 pounds Brian kept threatening me and hurling the insults my way, and mocking me when I were to binge on food. The skinnier I get, the less he insults me, until I binge. It becomes a hideous cycle, and somehow, Cyndi decided to join me.

Cyndi's father died a few years before this, and she had issues at home and was bullied by her family. She began to binge and purge just as heavily as me. We became a team, egging each other on and competing. 

I can not express how much thinking back to then hurts me. Self harm was essentially all I felt. Music,tv, movies...everything required energy to enjoy them, that I just couldn't give. My social life collapsed, as it would, and the meetings where I saw my friends I was reclused.

I can't remember how long this went on for. I remember reaching 90 pounds, and Brian showing me off to friends at the beach, saying how I looked like a supermodel. That day he offered me ice cream, and I refused, the internal battle going on.
I went home, and I remember him sitting on top of me in my bed screaming about how ugly I was, how I was sick and a disgrace. I remember how I didn't have the muscle to push him off, and how I could feel my bones everywhere I touched when I moved and shuffled to try and get out of his reach.

I was always cold. Skinny doesn't matter when you have to pile on clothing layers. This was summer, also. 

In September, I was 89 pounds, and 5""5. I found it easier to deal with Brian when my mind was gone and fluttering, and I had no energy to fight back when he would hold me down and spit on me and do the weekly- antagonizing.  I'm ashamed to say none of my friends saw how deathly I was becoming. There was very little fat on my body. 
Cyndi... was worse. She began to grow tufts of hair on her skin to keep her warm, and her hair was falling out in clumps. She had been over a whole week without eating; and when she had eaten that week, she had only had a hundred calories, with a whole week before that. Her body was shutting down. 

I remember her bragging about how she had less than 5% bodyfat, and if she lost ""a few more pounds"" she would have no fat left on her body. She was a walking skeleton. 

Self harm was fluent with both of us... whether it be laxative abuse (My record was 90 blue laxatives in one night, my tolerance had gone up to me needing nearly 50 pills for them to work, per night, usually)
or simply slicing parts of our bodies.

My worst memory is my dad banging on my door, with me barricading it with a chair, cutting the top half of my wrist (Not the bottom, for some reason I didn't want to die.) slicing it until it looked like a barcode, where I still have scars, and just sobbing, thinking of all of my friends from the library and more who didn't know this was happening, who went home and ate dinner and went to bed and thought about boys.

Brian had let me go out to eat with friends on a Wednesday night, and Cyndi was texting me on my tiny texting phone, the usual: ""i just binged. I'm so fucking ashamed."" and with me replying, ""You can do it, hold strong. Just binge it out."" I remember her texting me, ""I'm starving. I might binge again."" and then my phone dying.

I go home that night, and get up the next morning to at least 20 missed calls from her, and 3 voicemails, over 10 texts.. I go through them while my phone charges. ""Chelsea, where are you?"" ""Dude I feel really sick. I ate a lot, it's going to take at least a month to put off this weight."" ""Holy shit I feel really sick."" and then the calls began- 

""Chelsea, chelsea please pick up. I feel really bad. My stomache is cramping and I just threw up some blood. I ate too much. I ate over 4,000 calories and it was all a blur I can't even remember what-- oh god"" (hang up)

And finally, the last words I ever heard Cyndi say...
""Chelsea, where are you? I'm scared.""

Cyndi died that night, her mom called me the next night. Her stomache had ruptured,as her stomach lining was impossibly weak from weeks without food...and her mom didn't find her until the next day.

I knew, of course I knew. I began to call her over and over, filling her voicemail, panicking. After 4 hours with no reply, (I woke up around 4pm) her mom called me.

The moment she said the words I was fearing, I dropped my phone, fell back, and just screamed. I screamed for ten whole minutes, eyes sobbing- I'm crying right now typing this- that it was my fault. I wasn't there. My mom and Brian rushed to me, and the moment I wailed out ""Cyndi IS DEAD"" Brian took my phone and spoke to Cyndi's mother, then dragged me into the car, and drove me to the beach for some reason, while I hysterically sobbed.

The whole 2 hour ride there, he called each of his family members and friends, saying, ""Chelsea's friend just died. Yeaaah. I'm taking her to the beach overnight so she can relax. Yeah it's horrible. She was a sick girl though, it was a matter of time..."" Right in front of me. 

He even insulted her. ""She was an older girl. I was worried she was a bad influence on Chelsea. I heard she dropped out of school.""

And then finally, when I was on the beach,sitting in the water, crying into it, I heard him from the beach. ""Cyndi was a bad kid. I expected this. She was really sick and I'm just happy it was her and not MY daughter.""

Fast forward. A year passes, 15 now. Starting to become independent, after that incident I got over my eating disorder. I ride my bike everywhere, have sleepovers every weekend, lots of friends. Never told them about Brian.

Brian does a lot of creepy things that year. He begins hitting on a 14 year old girl from my church, Rachel; He calls her ""Honey"" and frequently compliments her, and won't stop asking her about her boyfriends and telling her to confide in him about her ""Relationship problems.""

He also began to scare my friend Sam, who was 17 and dating a friend of mine. He would always ask her to come out of my room and ""Sit with him,"" and tell her how beautiful she was and how she didn't need to date a guy like my friend, that she deserves a more mature man.

Of course, the beatings began to subside. I knew how to evade him, and even though I occasionally had to spend a few nights sleeping in the garage because he wanted to sleep IN my bed (Naked,or in just underwear, I should mention, under all of my sheets) I still made the best of my life, even though I was still forcibly homeschooled.

Eventually, I reached out to my youth pastor for help, because during one sermon he called me out (""And listen to your parents...CHELSEA."") telling him all of these things you have read, plus excruciating detail on Brian's assaults. The pastor of course immediately said he'd contact child services to do an investigation, and that he was so sorry.

But someone tipped Brian off. Brian began to stop punching me, and he only slapped and spit on me. He stopped leaving bruises, so when the woman came to interview my family, and looked at me I looked healthy. I told her the honest truth; he was a monster. She came back twice more, and told me as long as I had no bruises, there was no evidence, and that she was sorry.

Brian decided it was time for revenge. He had me kicked off of the church band on my 16th birthday- I was at a youth retreat, and the youth pastor took me aside before I walked onstage to sing, ""You aren't allowed onstage until your family gets better. I just feel you aren't fit to worship."" 

Brian did it. He had no job, and was living with a stranger and he somehow tricked child services AND a church into thinking I was the bad guy. I listened to him tell stories of me ""running out of my room and punching him in the face,"" and the moment child services left, he began the heavy beatings again. He had a tongue like a salesman. For someone as mentally ill as him, he could think of the most clever lies and excuses.

One night it was the worst. I was in my room, listening to Gorillaz, and he rips open my door and demands my laptop- the only present I had gotten for my sweet 16th- (I should mention his mother sent me $1,000 for my birthday, but he only gave me $20 of it and a used, clunky dell laptop) I beg for him to let me keep it, and he hears the lyric, ""White light, alcohol alcohol!"" come out of the laptop. He runs at me, enraged, and grabs me by my hair, and begins to scream about how it's ""Devil music"" and that I'm going to hell, and I'm a murderer and I ruin lives. I try to push him away, and he spits on me. I manage to wiggle away, with a chunk of hair being torn from my head, and he throws me onto the wooden floor, with me screaming at him to go away. I start crawling away on my back, scraping myself out of my room, but his foot comes down on my chest, knocking the wind out of me.

He begins to hoist me up by my hair and slaps me, screaming ""You're a mistake, you're Satan, you're autistic!"" before shoving me into a wall, further bruising my back. He picks me up and throws me back down so many times, my knees and elbows are bruised to purple, and there's blood streaming out of my leg where there's a gash. His favorite thing to do was punch my boobs; it hurt like agony, but it was his favorite move.
I tried fighting back, defensive, trying my hardest but it was never enough. He always overpowered me. It ends in me crawling back to my room,as he's now bored, curling on my bed and going to sleep.

I go to church the next night. I have a black eye, a large bruise on my chin- my hair is visibly choppy and sick-looking, and I'm wearing shorts and a t-shirt, desperate for someone to see the bruises and cuts. 

I discovered nobody could stop him but me. I need a happy ending, so badly. So that's when I began to plan.

1358148455.0	16jhcm	Witnessed a murder when I was 9 and didn't even realize it until after.	thebluesharpie	201	39	3	"&lt;I just posted a less scary one but remembered this when I was reading soemone's body-in-the-neighbors-freezer story, deleted that and posting this&gt;

I live in a city and state that had practically no crime rate (in 1998). So when my aunt was babysitting me and my cousin (both of us 8-9), it was no big deal to let us go out late at night and play in the front yard. We were having a blast pretending to spy on the neighbors, even though of course we couldn't really see a thing. 

Suddenly, a pickup truck pulls into the driveway a few houses down. We thought this would be the perfect time to spy on someone. We cross the street to get a better look and hide in a neighbors front yard. There is a girl sitting in the idling car and two guys go inside. Nothing happens for awhile so we meander away to do something else. A short time later, the two guys come out carrying huge bags and toss them in the back of the truck and everyone drives off.

A few days later, my mom answers the door to a police officer informing us that our neighbor and his friend stabbed his parents to death and asked if we knew anything. My 9 year old self had watched way too much Walker, Texas Ranger and knew the bad guys always found out who you were and came after you, so I didn't say anything.

EDIT/UPDATE: I forgot the best part. Prior to the murder there had been car breakins on our street and someone stole my Dad's guns out of his truck. After the murder (we did not know he stabbed them right away, just that he killed them) when they caught him, they found all my Dad's stuff in his trunk. The police called and told us the situation, saying they need to keep them as evidence for now, and I just remember my Dad saying ""Oh my god, I bet he shot them with my guns."" In the end he did not, but my Dad was so beside himself over it. Having the stolen property in their car was half the reason they were caught. They were pulled over and had a lot of suspicious stuff in their car (including bloody evidence).

1353593847.0	13mckg	People Are Crazy	rarkmuffalo	204	44	13	"For background; I'm a 16 year old girl and I live in England.

It was a normal day, I'd woken up pretty early to walk my little brother, Jake, to school. I said bye to him, told him to have a good day and proceeded to turn back.
Taking my usual short-cut through an alley, which takes 15 minutes to walk through and also comes out right next to my house, I grew aware of the man walking behind me. He was large, quite short and had greasy, slicked back hair and was wearing a pair of dirty jeans and an equally as vile t-shirt. Whenever I'd slow down my pace, or speed it up, he would do the same. Quite creeped out, and being a paranoid person anyway, I got home and locked the doors behind me. Looking out of my window, I could see him across the street, staring at my house and not moving. I shrugged it off and continued with my day.

Fast-forward to later that night.

It was 11pm and I'd been speaking to my boyfriend, Dean, on the phone when I went to close my bedroom curtains. I noticed, on the other side of the street, the man was still there, stood under a street light. He had something in his hand. I told Dean about this guy and how he's been standing outside for most of the day and he told me he'd come right over. When he parked up, he came in to check that I was fine and then went outside to confront this weird-ass guy. 

From my window, I could see the guy start to get violent, trying to hit, kick and stab Dean with what I can only assume was a knife. Dean, however, is 6''1, intimidating and is a brown belt in karate. He managed to pin down this guy, get the weapon off of him and restrain him long enough to call the police. When they got here, they took the guy whose name I later learned to be Lee, to the station. After taking a statement from Dean and I, we haven't heard anything else. Although, Dean told me that when he went outside, the guy had said he knew me and was waiting for me to come out and meet him, he said we'd known each-other forever and were best friends. That's when he started to get violent.

1362607314.0	19sw6f	And this is why I stopped wearing dresses.	Red1332	218	57	41	"Back in my late teens and early twenties I was going to college in Seattle and having the time of my life. Having grown up in a relatively conservative area, it felt good to be in a place where you could have tattoos, piercings and strangely colored hair and they would still take you seriously as a human being.

At the time of this story I was living with a boyfriend who kept weird hours as the desktop and server support guy for a small IT startup (it was the 90's and those were a dime a dozen in the Puget Sound.)

I found myself waiting for him to actually show up again on a strip of road known as The Ave near the University of Washington. Basically it was where the college kids filtered down to for cigarettes, pizza, cheap Chinese and second hand clothing. It was a good place to just hang out and bum cigarettes and wander around.

Now, I've had problems with my self image all my life so it was incredibly rare for me to wear dresses of any kind. Today, though, it was actually a gorgeous sunny day so I broke out the youthful uniform of the time, Doc Martens and a babydoll dress. I felt incredibly cute, and probably walked like it, too.

I was on the Ave for half an hour, hanging out at a bus stop where my bf had asked me to meet him when I noticed a VERY out of place man just staring at me. He was leaning against the glass windows of the building behind us, and I felt him staring at the back of my head before I turned around and saw him.

He was fat, balding, with spectacles -not glasses, SPECTACLES, wire rims and everything, oooold old style glasses- and wearing a tie, white shirt, khaki pants... like he'd just stumbled out of an office building and landed in the sunshine.

I tried to ignore him because I really hate it when people stare at me and at the time I was somewhat meek about confrontation. But as we sat there, I could feel him staring at me, so I broke away from the group at the bus stop and walked down a block or so. I was window shopping a record store when I saw his reflection in the window behind me. Unfortunately, we made eye contact because of that, and he took a step towards me.

This freaked me out so I pushed down further, and noted via reflections in windows across from us that he was still following me, still staring at me.

I crossed the street and noted with panic that the guy crossed the street as well. I couldn't figure out what the hell he could possibly want, especially when there were hundreds of people around, so I was now getting to the point of desperation. I walked back up the way I came hoping somehow my bf was finally there and waiting for me.

Noting the bf was not, I decided to dive in to a really busy business and hide out there. Unfortunately, I decided it should be the 7Eleven, which had a very prominent sign stating NO LOITERING.

I was also a bit of a good-girl in those days, so I had no idea how long it would be before I would be accused of loitering, adding to the stress.

I immediately went to the back of the store and hid, watching in the curved mirrors at the end of the aisles as the man came in, watched me for a second, then disappeared to the other side of the store.

as I couldn't see him at that point and was scared he would come up behind me from the back, I inched my way back to the front of the store. Unfortunately he saw me before I saw him, and he stared at me for a very long time before turning to the cash machine and messing with it.

At that point I decided I had enough weirdness to call the cops, so I ran up to the man at the counter and said ""There's this guy following me and he won't leave me alone, he's been following me up and down the Ave. Can you call the cops for me?""

And the guy looks at me like I'm an idiot and says ""Which guy?""

So I try to point him out as quietly as possible. The guy turns around, looks at the man, and as the man sees I'm talking toh im, he pockets his wallet and disappears outside.

""Look, he's just waiting for the bus and you're being paranoid,"" the guy tells me (because honestly, natural-born Seattlites just don't give a damn about your drama, even if it's legit.)

""Can I just stay in here until he gets on the bus, then?"" i ask.

""He's just waiting for the bus, you can't loiter,"" he responds.

Then he turns and sees the guy trying to stare at me through the reflective glass and it occurs to him maybe he's wrong.

""You know what? Never fucking mind,"" I say angrily at the guy and storm out, with the clerk saying ""Wait! Wait if you want..."" but the door slammed shut and I wasn't going back in there with someone who obviously didn't care if I got murdered in an alley.

For the next 45 minutes I circled down one side of the Ave and walked up the other, watching the man walk behind me slowly and stare at me. Buses came and went, and he didn't try to get on a single one.

when I realized my bf might be stuck on a project all evening and unable to call me -this is pre-ubiquitous cell phones for people- and that this guy might be circling with me all afternoon, I realized I would have to confront him. That was terrifying for me because I'm all of 5'3"" and this guy obviously had me in the weight department.

I took my position back up at my bus stop corner, waiting, when the guy once again stood behind me and began to stare. Buses came and went and watched them leave, then returned to staring at me.
I couldn't think of anything else at that point so I just turned around and started staring him down, trying my best ""fuck off"" look.

He looked away, then for some reason started smiling, which pissed me off. Finally, he pushed away from the wall and walked up to me with this thin little smile on his face.
""Beautiful day out,"" he said.

What the f***?? I thought.

""Yeah,"" I responded, staring and not smiling.

""Got any plans for this great weather?"" he asked

""Yeah. Dinner with my boyfriend whenever he finally shows up,"" I said tersely.
The smile fades off his face. ""Boyfriend?""

""yeah. I've been waiting for him here and he's seriously late. I'm about to go use the payphone to scream at him in a second.""

He stops for a moment, shuffles a bit, then asks ""How long have you two been going out?""

WHY IS THAT ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS?? I think. It probably showed on my face.

""So... you're just waiting for somebody. You're not hanging out on the corner,"" he finally asks.

""I'm waiting for my boyfriend, like I said. He's late. Excuse me, I need to go call him,"" I said, shoved past him, and went over to the same 7Eleven to use the payphone. I gave the man behind the counter a ""fuck off and die"" look through the window as I dialed. the counter guy has the courtesy to look embarrassed as hell this time because he was obviously wrong.

The man is still staring at me, but he's now looking like I shot his puppy or something.

Unfortunately my bf was not there, so I left a voicemail on his work phone and prayed that meant he's on his way, then walked back to the stop and put my back to the man, fidgeting angrily.

""Well, I hope you and your *boyfriend* have a lovely dinner,"" the man says, then without even checking which bus is coming, he just gets on it. I see him fumbling for change and realize the man is just trying to get away from me and didn't even know what the fare was.

My bf shows up 10 minutes later, and when I tell him the story he immediately realizes what happened.

""He thought you were a hooker. When he went to the cash machine, he was trying to show you that he had money to pay you.""

It never even occured to me that was going on. What sort of creeper continues to pursue someone AFTER they've walked away from you multiple times?? How clueless was this guy?

Needless to say, my bf made the point of stating that my skirt was rather short and that I probably caused it (I'm no longer with this guy because he turned out to be a control freak with self esteem issues) and for some reason I bought it. I put the dress away and only wore it when I knew I would be out of the city from then on.

It still angers me to this day that I got NO support when I was in an obviously WRONG situation.

Thanks for listening, guys."	t5_2t3t8	True

We drank some beers, took a couple of shots, and enjoyed the show. The night was fun until we went to wal mart after the show. 
Fast forward to twenty minutes after we start walking 
individually, around the store. I'm looking at girly stuff when the cousin runs up to me all panicky saying my bf got in a fight by trying to hit on someone's girlfriend and got arrested. Naturally I start crying, worrying...I've never been in a situation where someone I was with got arrested so I got scared.
Me and said cousin walked back to my apt while I tried to call the jail (repeatedly) and get information on my bf's wherabouts. Cousin is trying to keep me mad at him, saying things like you should get back at him for hitting on other girls, if you were mine i wouldn't do that, insert whatever other kiss ass creepy remarks you can think of.
Fast forward to my apt, I've just hung up after the jail said they'd call the cops on me for my repeated calls. (I wanted my bf home) still crying, when cousin creeps into my bedroom from the couch. ""can i get a bj?"" ""no, quit your shit, i'm with your cousin go to sleep."" he leaves.
ten minutes later he's back, and frustrated, he restrains my hands, attempts to force a bj out of me. I can't stop crying, saying no and crying out my boyfriends name. I'm not strong enough to get out of his grip. Fear grips me even harder when I realize he's trying to roll me over to pull my pants down. Tears stream down my face as i keep saying no. 
""no one is going to believe you"" ""he'll believe family first"" ""slut""
crying i'm afraid that he's right no one will believe me. PAIN.as he violates me...fuck this,I just CAN'T be this weak. I struggle harder, manage to free an arm and rip my Jeans up to block his...disgusting piece if you know what i mean. 
	 He proceeds to just get up, repeat how no one will believe me, and leaves the room. i hurriedly shut the door and cry, bawl my eyes out, i'm shaking, i'm disgusted with myself, i'm in shock that my worst fear just happened in my own home. ..
Since then I have anxiety attacks, nightmares, paranoia, constantly check the locks, and I can't be outside by myself very long during the day, and not at all at night.
.He was released from jail last week, right before Thanksgiving. You know how people say they believe you, but you know they really don't? I'M finding out the truth about how everyone really felt...not even my mom believes me...
.pI've lost faith in this world, I was raped and because i was too scared to report it right away (a day passed before I told anyone) that suddenly means I'm lying. my biggest fucking fear yet I'm
the liar. 

I'm having the nightmares again, paranoia got worse to. I just need someone to believe me, anyone...I just need someone to know the truth.

EDIT:: thank you for your kind words, I started crying when I read them, its just such a relief to know that not everyone is heartless and quick to dismiss a victim. I will keep trying to put him away. supposedly he's going to fort worth, tx so please be careful out there... You guys have no idea how much the words ""I believe you"" can shake the hope back into my soul"	t5_2t3t8	True
1352509774.0	12xyt0	My Apartment Door Creaks Every Single Evening I'm Home	sadsapling	202	41	29	"We have been receiving notices around my apartment complex that there have been a string of robberies in the area.  In conjunction with this, almost every single evening I'm home, I hear my front door creak (as if someone is trying to open it).  Usually it's locked, so the door just creaks and the lock hits the door frame.

The other night, however, I forgot to lock my door, and again the creaking , only this time I heard the door open.  I assumed it was my fiance, but after a few seconds nothing happened.   The next thing I know, the door is shut (though not all the way, it is just resting against the door frame but not latched shut), and my cat is staring at the doorway.  I leaped over the couch (it was an adrenaline moment of epicness), and slammed it shut all the way and locked it.

The thing is, I was sitting on my couch playing Xbox, and would be plainly visible the minute someone looked inside.  Either somehow the wind blew my door open, or someone opened my door, saw the back of my head, and shut the door, realizing an easy robbery was not likely.

Either way, the creaking has continued after this.  I always look out the peephole, but by the time I get over to the door, someone would easily be out of view.

1331591922.0	qtlh0	[My] Brush With Sex Slavery	insanebane	204	44	28	I must have been roughly six years old. Me and my parents were going to stay at a hotel downtown. We arrived there at night, it was cold out. I still remember how bad I wanted to get inside. So bad, in fact, I left my favorite toy in the car. It was Buzz Lightyear from Toy Story. As we entered, a lady approached me. She seemed normal but had this feel about her. Looking back, I feel as though that woman didn't even possess a soul. She asked me if I wanted to go play with the other children. I wouldn't talk to her. I was an only child and didn't have many friends, so I was extremely shy. My parents seemed to appear from behind me and grab me by the hand and take me to our room. We came back down later to get the remainder of our stuff and cops were in the building. The questions my mother and father and held up a picture of the woman I talked to. She apparently runs a human-trafficking ring and was trying to get young children by pretending to be staff.

1371837805.0	1gt3du	Why I don't go to Wal-Mart after dark	gir_loves_thecupcake	188	30	27	"I've encountered my fair share of creepers in my 26 years. I posted another story of my first encounter when I was 11. I've also had a string of encounters at work that I like to call 'Adventures in Waitressing'. Maybe I'll write about those another time. The following, however was probably the most dangerous situation I've ever been in where creepy strangers were involved.

After work one night a friend and I decided to run to the Wal-Mart up the street together to grab a few things. This was a 24 hour Wal-Mart in a not so great area, and not the kind of place any young woman wants to go alone at night. I was 20 at the time and My friend was 19, both of us female. We take separate vehicles and park a fairly far from the entrance so that we are able to park next to one another. Even though it was about 10:30 at night, the place was pretty busy and we were definitely further from the entrance than we wanted to be, but we managed to park near a light. We were pretty satisfied with our spots and headed inside. 

After about 15 or 20 minutes, we have all of our things, have managed to check out in a timely manner (record speed for Wal-Mart as far as I'm concerned) and are on our way. As we are approaching our cars, we immediately notice a shady little hooptie of a car parked two spots down from mine, sitting in the open with two men leaning against the passenger's side. We continue as if nothing is wrong, smiling and chatting with one another, but our chatter has turned to ""you see these guys?"" ""yeah"" ""ok, we're gonna leave as quickly as possible, I've got your back"". We say goodbye, but unfortunately I have to walk around to my driver's side directly in front of them. As I make my way around the back of my car, keys in hand, they both push themselves away from the car and one starts making his way towards me. 

He yells out, ""Hey baby whatchyour name is?"". I ignore him and try stick my key in the door. I miss. I take a breath and try again but I continue to struggle with the lock. Meanwhile, this man is rambling on about how beautiful we are and he and his friend want to take us to a party. If we would just get in their car they will take us to this party and hook us up. You know, because we're so fine and all. I'm starting to panic a little as he's getting closer and continually asking my name more and more aggressively. I finally get my door unlocked and open, and in frustrated stupidity I tell him ""My name is gir_loves_thecupcake, and I'm leaving. I jump in the driver's seat and slam and lock the door. As I'm sticking my key in the ignition, this son of a bitch actually leans on my car and continues to harass me about this ""party"" through my cracked window. Now, in the summertime where I'm from it gets incredibly hot even at night and is common practice to leave windows cracked for comfort. It's then that I realize, its still 90 some degrees out and this dude is wearing a long coat. The alarm bells are screaming in my head, but this dude is plastered to my car and I'm not thinking straight. I ask him through the window crack to please step away from my vehicle.

 He continues to try and ask me questions and tell me that my fine friend and I really need to get in their car. I have my mace in my hand, but my windows are manual and if I tried to spray through the crack I would end up getting myself more than him. I ask him nicely one more time to please back off and when he doesn't comply I finally yell ""You need to get the fuck off my car because I'm leaving with or without you on it! I WILL RUN YOU OVER MOTHERFUCKER!!"" As I throw my car in drive, he yells ""The fuck you just say to me?! BITCH IMA FUCKING SHOOT YOU!"" and reaches into his long coat. My friend, who has been sitting in her car next to me trying to figure out what to do (this whole exchange took place in just a couple of minutes) guns it through the parking lot and I follow after her.

We drive across the lot without looking back, until we find one of those security vehicles. We stop and my friend jumps out and runs to his open window to tell him what just happened. He starts driving over to them, but they jump in their shitty car and take off. We left Wal-Mart and drove to the parking lot of a McDonalds to talk and make sure we were both okay. We talked about the incident and came to the conclusion that they had probably chosen to wait by our cars considering we each had distinctly feminine indicators on them. I had tinkerbell on my license plate and a matching sticker in my back widow. My friend (who races motorcycles) had a big pink 'SKIN' sticker across the back window of her truck. We were sufficiently freaked out, and very glad we made it out of the situation unharmed. I don't think either of us has ever gone to a Wal-Mart after dark since."	t5_2t3t8	True
1369504174.0	1f1ee4	Living above a popular bar was not fun...	toadsanchez420	179	19	24	"Ok, so I am not even sure if this is where to post this, but I'll give it a go.  I am a 27 year old male.  This happened when I was in 5th grade, so I was about 11 years old.

The whole idea of pedophiles and kids being abducted wasn't a huge publicized deal back then.  Well. at least not as much as it is now.  But we lived above a bar that was very busy every night.  Most of the people were nice, and sometimes they would buy us a can of pop or something.  But nothing weird or dangerous ever went on, that I'm aware of.

We lived on a busy street though, so we weren't really allowed to leave the block, unless we went over the my elementary school across the street(side street, not the busy street).  So most of the time, we were stuck out in the back yard.  

So, I'm 11, my brother Josh is 9, and my cousin Krystle was 11 as well.   We were trying to play hide and seek but it was limited.  We were sort of used to the bar customers coming out the back door and going to their car, or vice versa.  Nobody ever said more than 'Hi' though, and they left us alone.

Well, one chick, who was probably in her 40's,  comes up and asks us what we are doing.  We tell her we are playing hide and seek, and it was my brothers turn.  Well, my brother was very small for his age, due to lead paint.  So he looked like he was 5 or 6.  So she comes over, picks him up, and puts him in an empty trash can.  This was one of those with the lid and the locking handles.  We are freaking out trying to get him out, and ended up having to know the trash can over since neither of us were tall enough to lift him out. We run up the back stairs screaming for my mom, and we tell her what happened.  Well, my neighbor's daughter, Carrie, was there.  I was madly in love with this girl, or infatuated, whatever.  But I had had a crush on this girl for a long time, and here she was,  with her mom, talking to my mom.  She was 16 at the time, I think.  And man, was she gorgeous.

Anyway, so we decide to play in the entry room to the apartment instead.  It has the doors to each apartment, and it was basically a large laundry room.  A couple hours go by, and all of a sudden this bitch shows up again, out of nowhere.  Apparently she made not of us going up the back stairs and remembered it later in her drunken stupor. Josh and Krystle run inside, but when I got up, I twisted my ankle, and so this chick grabs me by the arm, and tries to pull me out the door.

My neighbor comes running out and her daughter grabs my other arm, and starts pulling.  So I got a drunk chick trying to haul my ass out the back door for no apparent reason, and my childhood crush trying to save my life.

It was like magic,  Carrie pulled my arm, made the chick stumble and then punched her in the mouth as hard as she could.  Next thing I knew I got Carrie with her arms around me, trying to comfort me.  So it wasn't all bad.  But anyway, I still had to go to the doctor because my arm was all frewed up.  

The next week this chick came by with the police and apparently had a much different story to them and somehow thought that Carrie and I were going to be paying for her hospital bills, but that she wouldn't press charges.  Well, there were 3 kids, a teenager and 2 adult witnesses that told the cops a different story about a drunk woman trying to abduct a kid.  The tone of that conversation changed and I was taken down to the station with my mom and stepdad, so I could answer questions.

After that, I don't remember anything ever coming of it.  

tl;dr - was almost taken by a drunk woman.  But my childhood crush turned into Xena Warrior Princess and heroicly saved my ass.

1352823732.0	134l5m	Ten Crucial Safety Tips--Share with others, make these known!	failsandfacepalms	201	41	25	"In daylight hours, refresh yourself of these things to do in an emergency situation...

This is for you, and for you to share with your wife, your children, everyone you know. After reading these ten crucial tips, tell them to someone you care about. Print them, forward them, memorize them! It never hurts to be careful in this crazy world we live in.

1. Tip from Tae Kwon Do:

The elbow is the strongest point on your body. If you are close enough to use it, wham it hard into the person's nose, skull, inbetween the ribs, any weak point. If you can, AIM FOR THE LEFT SIDE OF THEIR NECK! This may cause them to go unconscious.

2. Learned this from a tourist guide. If a robber asks for your wallet and/or purse, do not hand it to him. Toss it away from you.... Chances are that he is more interested in your wallet and/or purse than you, and he will go for the wallet/purse. Run like mad in the other direction!

3. If you are ever thrown into the trunk of a car, kick out the back tail lights and stick your arm out the hole and start waving like crazy.. The driver won't see you, but everybody else will. This has saved lives.

4. Women have a tendency to get into their cars after shopping, eating, working, etc., and just sit (doing their checkbook, doing makeup, making a list, etc.) Don't do this! The predator will be watching you, and this is the perfect opportunity for him to get in on the passenger side, put a gun to your head, and tell you where to go.

As soon as you get into your car , lock the doors and leave.

If someone is in the car with a gun to your head Do not drive off.

Repeat:

Do not drive off!

Instead gun the engine and speed into anything, wrecking the car. Your air bag will save you. If the person is in the back seat they will get the worst of it . As soon as the car crashes bail out and run. It is better than having them find your body in a remote location.

5. A few notes about getting into your car in a parking lot, or parking garage:

A.) Be aware: look around you, look into your car, at the passenger side floor , and in the back seat.

B.) If you are parked next to a big van, enter your car from the passenger door. Most serial killers attack their victims by pulling them into their vans while the women are attempting to get into their cars.

C.) Look at the car parked on the driver's side of your vehicle, and the passenger side... If a male is sitting alone in the seat nearest your car, you may want to walk back into the mall, or work, and get a guard/policeman to walk you back out.

It is always better to be safe than sorry. (And better paranoid than dead.)

6. Always take the elevator instead of the stairs. Stairwells are horrible places to be alone and the perfect crime spot. This is especially true at night!)

7. If the predator has a gun and you are not under his control,

Always run!

The predator will only hit you (a running target) 4 in 100 times; and even then, it most likely Will Not be a vital organ.. Run, preferably in a zig -zag pattern!

8. As a woman, I am always trying to be sympathetic:

Stop

It may get you raped, or killed.

Ted Bundy, the serial killer, was a good-looking, well educated man, who Always played on the sympathies of unsuspecting women. He walked with a cane, or a limp, and often asked 'for help' into his vehicle or with his vehicle, which is when he abducted his next victim.

Another Safety Point:

Someone just told me that her friend heard a crying baby on her porch the night before last, and she called the police because it was late and she thought it was weird.. The police told her 'Whatever you do, Do Not open the door..' The lady then said that it sounded like the baby had crawled near a window, and she was worried that it would crawl to the street and get run over. The policeman said, 'We already have a unit on the way,whatever you do, Do Not open the door.'

He told her that they think a serial killer has a baby's cry recorded and uses it to coax women out of their homes thinking that someone dropped off a baby... He said they have not verified it, but have had several calls by women saying that they hear baby's cries outside their doors when they're home alone at night.

This one applies for everybody: Water scam!

If you wake up in the middle of the night to hear all your taps outside running or what you think is a burst pipe, do not go out to investigate! These people turn on all your outside taps full blow so that you will go out to investigate and then attack.

10. Come off as psychotic! Wear hoods, baggy clothing, make yourself seem larger than you really are. Look angry. NEVER WEAR HEADPHONES. Sorry to put it in all caps, but this is important. The predator will take advantage of the fact you are weak in one sense. Jam your hands deep in your pockets.

If you are being followed, face the person. Say something not scary, but unnerving. For example: ""No fleas in clean hair, no bats in your underwear. That's the way I like it. I was expecting you. Do you know what blood tastes like? I would like to know..."" Add an evil cackle in there, and snap your neck all the way to the side. Act like an escaped schizophrenic on meth. 

Do not keep a weapon with you unless you fully intend to use it and know how to. Learn about your state's self defense weapon laws. I recommend pepper spray, or even just breath spray with alcohol in it.

There is a street in my city that is known for having a random assortment of shops and is one of the more popular places for people to walk and shop. A few years ago I was doing just that with a friend. We were going from used clothing store to used clothing store looking at funny sweaters. I noticed this older gentleman walking behind us down the street at one pint but thought nothing of it. It was the middle of the day and he could have been anyone, although he did look unusual. He was quite tall and dressed in hiking gear from about 40 years ago. He also had an old giant mountaineering backpack on.
I did take note after he followed us into two different stores. I started to get more creeped out when I noticed that he was watching me. Not the attractive girl I was with but the dude in his early 20s. 
I try to play it off as nothing but he comes right up to me. Grabs my arm and whispers ""There have been a few murders around here lately. The good lord knows what you have done and will bring you to justice.""... Turns on his heel and walks out the door.

A few years back I was at Camp Dearborn in Milford, Michigan. It basically is a camp, but it has electricity, bathrooms, parks, a pool, etc.. I go every year with my family.

Every tent structure has it's own fire pit and every night we stay up till like 5a.m just talking and having fun. Well one night a man who we hadn't ever seen in our row of tents asked if he could hang out at our fire. We told him sure, so he sat down cracked a beer and started talking to us.

He seemed like a pretty cool guy, he was from Ohio and was visiting with a few friends who were sleeping according to him. He left after a while and wandered down the rows out of sight. We stayed out for another few minutes and then all decided to go to sleep.

About three hours had passed since we went in and I was awoken due to someone shaking me. I wiped my eyes and looked up to see the man standing over me. I freaked out and jumped back asking him what the hell he was doing in my tent. He asked if I could come back out and hang with him at the fire. I raised my voice and told him to leave my tent, and he had. As he left my parents woke up and I told them that the man from the fire was just in our tent. My dad got up and grabbed a bat from our sports bin. He walked outside but the man was gone. We fell back asleep until the morning.

We awoke to find police and ambulances around the camp. We asked an officer what had happened, and he told us that last night a young girl, 13, and a young boy, 15, were both lured outside by a man that had visited their fires in the night and raped them behind their tents. He was caught by authorities and the man turned out to be the same man that had walked into my tent and tried to lure me outside. If I had listened to him instead of freaking out, I could have been raped.

That thought sticks with me to this day, and we never let people we don't know at our fires anymore. I never heard what happened to the man or the victims after that, but I just thank God that I hadn't made a stupid mistake that dreadful night."	t5_2t3t8	True

I think I must have been 14 or 15 when this happened. I was with my cousin who is the same age as me, and being teen girls we were interested in shopping for clothes and makeup and walked to a store from her house. On the way back we were passing by an alley between two churches, or maybe a church and the rectory? And some guy comes out from between the two buildings and exposes himself to us. Well the situation just seemed too ridiculous to be real and I started laughing. The guy turned bright red, covered himself back up, and ran away. Then I turned to my cousin and she just looked so horrified and frightened, that I laughed even more.

She was shocked that I wasn't scared and treated me like I was some kind of hero. But honestly, when it happened I didn't have time to think and it really struck me as bizarro world and not real. It's only later that I had time to think, what if he had a weapon? What if I pissed him off so bad he decided to use it on me? etc and was frightened then.

EDIT: I meant to say that part of the reason I laughed is because he jumped out from between two CHURCHES. That also seemed surreal, that he could consider exposing himself in front of a couple of ""houses of God"" appropriate."	t5_2t3t8	True
1353093143.0	13b9c8	The Scottish Deer-man	Storydog	197	42	12	"One of my friends has a love for camping, bless his soul. Anyway, we're close so I'm occasionally taken along on his trips. We've been doing it since secondary school (aged 13,) and as we grew older, we ended up in some rather remote places. This is anything from 30 minutes to six hours drive from home.

So this is Scotland. Most of you will know that it rains a lot.  During my 17th summer, it didn't - in fact, the weather was wonderful. 
Cue my friend calling up and insisting we go camping somewhere crazy. We didn't get this opportunity much. Sure!

Cue Ardnamurchan; an extremely remote peninsula in the highlands region. Most of this area is only accessible by single-track road. Hey, we had the sun on our side at least.


Except we didn't, because the Scottish microclimate is a fickle bitch. So now we have mist, we have rain, we have thunder, we have misery. However, after driving several hours north of Ayrshire, there was no way we'd give up and go home.  Long story short, my friend, his friend and I sat in a small three man tent watching the rain, drinking whisky and being miserable. Actually, a typical Scottish way of life. 

There are - no - villages within reasonable walking distance so the sky is bloody dark. Anyway, after this, alcohol, misty rain and isolation the whole thing became very creepy.  Its around this point when I see him.

Our tent was looking over a large moor surrounded by forest and dotted with small lochs / ponds. The only reason I see him is because his reflection on the loch is illuminated by the moon. He's a good distance away, but after I noticed him he was impossible to miss. It was like a silhouette that stood, facing us with his hands near his head. Anyway, the weirdest thing about this guy was that he had horns.
So it was a deer, right? There's loads of deer kicking around. 
No, because as we watched him, we saw him move. Quick, darting jerks, but very human ones. We concluded that this guy was nuts. His hands were holding antlers on his head and he was having a laugh scaring the kids in their tent. Whatever, right? Yeah, let's drink a little more.

So my friends and I biffed out for 30 minutes. This turned into jokes about Dr. Deer. This turned into my friends passing out in a drunken stupor. Hell, we couldn't even see the guy anymore. Maybe it was a deer after all. Whisky does crazy things.

I decide to go out for a piss, in my underwear, in the rain because, again; whisky.  I'm standing in the darkness near a bush doing my business when I see movement. This time, close by.  Just as well I'm halfway through taking a leak, because.. you know. 
The deer man appears, holding the antlers at his waist like swords. It doesn't sound like much, but Jesus Christ that was the scariest moment of my life. I couldn't talk, I couldn't breathe, I COULD put my dick away because, you know, priorities. 

This guy stood and stared and grinned then said something. Being Scottish myself, i can deal with some difficult accents. Whatever this guy said sounded foreign. At that point I ran, calling my friends' names like the big man I was.  You know that feeling in a dream where you keep trying to run but end up jogging on the spot? It felt like that.

The last glimpse I caught of him was his face as I looked behind me. He was running at me, breathing heavily and may or may not have had his tongue out. I don't know, I wasn't going to get tied up in the details.
For some reason, I rushed into the tent for safety where my friends were wondering what the fuck kind of piss I just took. After explaining what happened, we were brave enough to look outside. The guy had gone. That, or was hiding crouched in the darkness.

Needless to say, we packed the tent and left. 2am. The worst, scariest walk of shame in my life.

To this day, I have no idea who that guy was. I'm assuming he was another camper or a local having some fun, or maybe he was actually a seriously disturbed stag fan.  The next time we visited Ardnamurchan, we made sure to stay in a holiday home in the safety of a village.

**TLDR:** Man dressed as a deer creeps on me as I take a leak."	t5_2t3t8	True
1349006669.0	10phng	Emo guy stalked me..	EmoGuyStalkedMe	219	62	30	"I posted this on a throwaway because I don't really want to be found. Youll figure out why if you read the whole story.

So back in high school, I was one of those 14 yr old goth kids. Always wore those black pants with chains/zippers/pockets everywhere (still kinda do &gt;.&gt;). It got me the occasional weird attention but I just shrugged it off. Well, I had a study hall as my last class before school let out for the day. Id usually be in the back, out of view of the librarian, feet up on the table, headphones on my head and a book in my lap. I dont really know when this started because one day, I went into the front of my backpack (I would kick it under the table) only to find notes.. Like 10 folded up into those weird triangles with my first intial on them...

I opened them up to find ALL of them, were written with blood. They were all attempts at poems (very horrible ones) like ""what flower would my maiden love so that I may trace your flesh with its petals? Would only a black rose work because itll share the color of our hearts? Maybe its thorns may prick you and I may suckle the blood from your finger and we can be one.""

No marking of who it was from, and I couldnt figure out when they could have gotten there. So by then when I was in that library, I started sitting nearer to the middle where everyone could see me, with my feet on my backpack and I could never get into my books cause I kept looking around. (only place I thought they could do it cause in other classes I sat in the back row with my backpack at my side, I know everyone that walked behind me)

One day after school, I didnt have any more notes for a week. I was thinking ""Sweet, its over."" until I was walking home a few days later.. I had my headphones on like usual, so I couldnt hear anything around me. Out of nowhere I felt like I was being watched/followed. I turned off my headphones and tried to listen, to see if I could hear crunching behind me. Nope. I did a casual glance around, didnt see anyone. I started fast-walking home and instantly ran up to my room and looked around out the window. (2nd floor of an apartment complex) a few days later I was outside watching my nephew play with the complex kids. One of the younger girls Danielle came over and sat next to me on the granite step in front of our door. I was drawing at the time and she was watching me. Out of the blue she asks ""So who was that boy that keeps coming here? Is he your boyfriend?"" (mind you shes like, 8-9) me ""What boy?"" Danielle ""The boy with all black. He dresses like you do."" My face drained of all color. I asked her ""Have you seen him at all today?"" Danielle ""Yeah. He once came and asked if you lived here, I told him you did. I thought he was your friend cause he said all the stuff you wear."" me ""Is he here now?"" By then my voice is panicky and she gets a little worried ""I dont know. Last I saw he was messing with Bills garage."" (Bill is our maintenance man. He hasn't been around for a month because everythings been ok recently)

I called to my nephew and had him come inside with me. He was annoyed but I set him up with the Xbox and he calmed down after that. I told my parents and showed them the letters. They called the cops and we contacted Bill to check out his garage. Sure enough it was broken into and it looked like someone was hiding out in there but they were gone.

No more letters after that, no more strange sensations while walking home and Danielle didn't see him again (I thank that little nosey brat so much now)

But somehow, I keep getting these creepy emails.. Similar writing to the letters from different emails each time. Ive changed mine multiple times, and itll be a few months before they start up again. Its been 10 years and I still get one every 6 months or so. Ive moved to a different town so I dont know if hes here as well.. Thats why the throwaway.. 

TL;DR creepy guy in all black, leaving poems in his blood. Neighbors kid saw him at our garage. Cops called. Garage appeared lived in. Now just random creepy emails every 6 months. Even after I change mine."	t5_2t3t8	True
1348116187.0	106ejn	The Robin Williams Doppleganger &amp; Redneck: The Hillbilly	SmoSays	186	31	20	"I met Jessica in 4th grade and we became best friends almost immediately. We spent all day at school together and spent time at each others' homes. She was the second oldest of five, and the only girl. Her parents were divorced but both were pretty nice. 

Our families quickly became intertwined. They were in the lower income bracket, even living in trailer parks at times. Her mom, Gail, was a school bus driver and the only earner in the house. The oldest boy was mentally handicap and did what work he could to help out, but his mom insisted on him saving for college. 

At one point Gail got hurt on the job and couldn't drive any more. I think her back was hurt or something, I was quite young then, in fifth grade at this time. I also couldn't tell you what job she took as a result, but it was there that Gail met Dan. 

Dan, as the title implies, looked a lot like Robin Williams, but skinnier and taller. They had a short courtship and soon married. 

I remember him being a strict man with the boys, but not with Jessica. He could sometimes be verbally abusive to them, calling them 'dumb' and 'retarded'. 

But he would also play with us kids. He loved to have tickle fights and - I remember this so clearly - loved to tickle Jess and me on the super-upper-inner thigh. I didn't like being touched there but didn't ever have a reason why. I just didn't want him to. 

While I never mentally cited him as the reason, it was around this point I stopped wanting to go over to Jessica's house. I always wanted her to spend the night at my place and to be honest, she preferred it that way as well. But my father thought I was being disrespectful due to their low income (I have a crippling fear of bugs, and I know at one point they had roaches, but that was before Dan was in the picture) so he would set an appointment with Gail to have me go over there. 

They moved around a lot and Jessica was no longer in my same school. Sometimes she was even in different cities and yet we still kept in contact and she'd visit me when she could. 

Then came her twelfth birthday. It was at a hotel, where a bunch of girls would get a room separate from her parents, and spend the night swimming or just hanging out. I didn't stay the night (either I legitimately had prior plans or I just plain didn't want to) but I did hang out a bit. We spent most of the time in the pool area, if not all. I couldn't tell you what the rooms looked like or even what the rest of the hotel looked like. Gail and Dan had just had a newborn (boy #5, kid #6) and Gail frequently had to excuse herself to feed or change the baby. Sometimes the chlorine in the air bothered him (or something) so she left Dan in charge of us. A bunch of prepubescent girls. In bathing suits. 

Sometimes he'd just watch, super intently, and other times he'd get in the pool with us and toss us about or whatever. 

I went home with no incident but that was the last I saw Dan in person. 

Fast forwardfour years. Jess comes over unnanounced (not unusual, though she'd usually call to make sure we were actually home) and tells me and my mother what happened. 

Though it will be no shock to the readers to discover that Dan had been molesting Jessica ever since they married. Molesting feels too soft . . . raping. He had been raping her almost every night. Gail would be out on the meds she had to take to sleep (she was in a lot of pain from the injury she'd sustained) and he'd go into Jess's room and rape her. Over and over. 

She was afraid to tell her mom, afraid she wouldn't believe her and even doubting it all herself. My parents and I both convinced her to tell her mom. 

Her mom, Mother Of The Fucking Year, promptly divorced his ass and took him to court. On top of the pedophilia charge and, because she was at the age of consent at 16, plain old rape charges, he also got mad at Gail when she threw him out and punched her. So he also got battery. 

All in all, and with some other lesser charges, he got about 10-20 years and, waiting for when he gets out, a restraining order against Gail, Jess, and the boys. 

Jess has had a rough life since then but with some therapy, she's one of the most hardworking people I know, usually having two or three jobs at once, with two sons. I still talk to her and her family, and they, us. We're not as close as we used to be, but still thick as relatives.

1346698468.0	zajql	From mutual friend to psycho stalker	blasphumorus	243	84	54	"Now, I have my share of paranormal stories, but I also have a good portion of downright creepy REAL human being encounters... 
All in all, I have so many freaking stories that I should just write a book. Anyway, hope you like this one, too.

I was probably 19. I had just gotten out of a bad relationship, and was looking for new people to get my mind off the abuse (it was awful.)  

A week or two after my break-up, I get a random friend request on facebook. ""David (No- not my friend Dave. lol) wants to be your friend."" We had about 4 friends in common. I went to school with all these people, so I assumed it would be safe to add him. What harm could come of it? Moments later, I get an IM. ""Hey Katie, I'm David. How are you? I love your pictures. You are quite beautiful."" Okay, I was a very naive person in high school, so my initial thought was, ""How lovely! A compliment!"" I thanked him and continued to make small talk.

After a few weeks of chatting, he asked for my phone number. He was a really nice guy, and had gone to church with my friends. I never did ask my friends about him, or even clarify that they all went to the church together. So I gave him my number without hesitation. Yes, I know... It was a very dumb move. No longer than 5 minutes later, I start getting a phone call. Unable to recognize the number, I ignore it, and let it go to voice mail. Keep in mind that David and I are still talking on facebook, and there's no inkling that he wants to text or call me. My voicemail icon starts blinking. I get a shiver down my spine, and I'm thinking to myself, ""Do I really want to listen to this?"" I cave in. ""Hey Katie, It's David."" God, that voice was so deep and murderous. ""I just wanted to call you to see how you were and hear your beautiful voice. Alright, talk to you later. Don't forget to call back! Bye gorgeous."" and that's the end of it. I send him an IM about it, ""Why did you call me?"" He responds with: ""I wanted to hear your voice, your breath and your beauty."" At this point, I'm a little creeped out, but I brush it off as nerves. He calls again that night, so I pick up. ""Hey Katie, It's David."" I sigh. We start to talk about his job his faith in God (very strong faith, so he claims. Avid bible reader.) etc. After a few minutes, he begins to tell me that he'd like to ""court me."" Having been home-schooled part of my life in a Christian group, I knew that meant being supervised by parents, getting married and pregnant early on in life, and I wanted no fucking part of that. After telling him that it wasn't a good idea to date, he begins to tell me yet again that he wants to court me, love me, and move down to be closer to me. Even if that meant just being friends. I continue to tell him that it's a bad idea, but it's as if he can't even hear me. He then tells me that he found a place near the church, and he'll be moving down in March of the next year (it was October when he said all this.) After this little conversation, I disable him from messaging me, and I deleted the number. 

A few days later, David calls again. I promptly ignore it, and I get yet another voicemail. It's the same thing over and over again. ""Hey Katie, it's David."" Why did that little introduction always creep me out? He would always leave messages about how much he cared about me, how he missed me and the sound of my voice, blah blah blah. This went of for weeks, and in that span of time, I met my boyfriend (current fiancée), Eric. Eric and I began talking in late October/early November. In December, roughly 4-5 weeks after I had stopped talking to David, I changed my relationship status to ""in a relationship."" I get a mass of furious texts. ""You harlot, I told you we were going to be together!"" ""You told me I had a chance if I ever moved down there to be closer to you!"" ""You stupid bitch! You're going to hell for smiting me!"" The list goes on and on. Then came the voicemails. ""You're a fucking bitch. God will make sure you're in the pits of hell for what you did to me. You led me on! You broke my heart into a million pieces, and you will go to hell for it.""  Before I can finish the VM, my phone starts ringing. Eric snatched it away from me, and answered. Eric is a 6'4-6'5, broadly built man. He has the build of a Solider, penetrating (kind of scary at times) brown eyes, dark buzzed haircut, a deep, intimidating voice and is extremely protective/wary. Needless to say, he's not the kind of guy you'd want to piss off. Initially, Eric is very calm with David. He tells him never to contact me again in any form. David doesn't like this, so he starts throwing bible verses and curses at Eric. Eric's face is flushed with anger and protection. He screams that David is to stay at least 100 miles away from me, and if/when he finds that he's 99 miles away from me, he'll skin him like an animal. He then proceeds to hang up and hug me tightly. He reassured me that he'd never let that guy near me.

A few days pass, and I start feeling weird... as if someone is watching me. It's dark and I'm just getting back from my finals. Something isn't right. I turn around to see a figure hiding behind a tree. I swear my legs reacted faster than my mind, because before I could even think about what I saw, I was already shutting the front door. To make matters worse, the house was pitch black, and no one was home. The first thing I do is check the side door. Locked. Next I scurry to the back door, and to my horror, it's slightly open. (it's a sliding glass door that leads out to the pool and enclosed deck.) The only thing on my mind at that point is FUCK. I grab my dogs (a pomeranian and golden retriever) and high tail it to my bedroom and slam the door. No more than a second later, my Golden starts going nuts. She's barking her fucking head off, and the pomeranian is freaking the HELL out. I'm sobbing my eyes out, calling Eric, holding on to my dogs, and all of a sudden, someone starts banging on my window. ""Katie! It's okay!"" WHAT THE FUCK. It's David. He came at least 500 miles, somehow freakishly found my address, and was now banging on my window. Just then, I hear someone shouting. My dad, who's a retired Cop, is at my window on top of the guy. It turns out, my mom and dad were just getting home from a date when they had seen the weird car hidden behind the trees. My dad had decided to park the car in the street, leave the keys with my mom, and sneak around to see what was going on. It turns out that David had a gun with him, and if my dad hadn't have been there, I don't know what would have come of the situation. Any one of us (or all of us) would have been dead. Thankfully, David is serving a LOT of time in another state. My parents still live in that house, but by the time he gets out, they'll be happily sailing the coast (retirement plans. lol). And as for me? I live in a different county with the love of my life, who is now a Cop.

P.S.

Sorry if there are any grammar and/or typos. I was rushing to get all my thoughts down as they were flowing in.

**UPDATE!!**

I forgot to mention something. Our mutual friends had informed me that they had to ""ban him"" from the church because he had a personal space issue with some of the girls there. I should have trusted my gut. Le sigh."	t5_2t3t8	True

So we got to the museum, and everything was going fine, but then I really had to use the restroom. My teacher was preoccupied, as were all the chaperones, so they sent me by myself, as I was very responsible. (silly judgement on their part, I know, but I was a pretty smart little girl)
So anyways, I go to  use the restroom when a girl, probably 17 or 18, goes into the restroom. The bathroom was in a corner, so it wasn't very visible. Anyway, a creepy looking man sneakily walks up sort of behind the girl, turns to me and whispers ""Shh"", then follows the girl into the bathroom.
I knew this was not right at all, so I went up to a security guard and told them that a man had just followed a pretty girl into the bathroom.
The guy got taken away by the police, and I never heard about him again. 
I guess it was just really good judgement and instinct on my part.

TL;DR 6-year old me sees creeper following a girl into bathroom, and reports it to the police."	t5_2t3t8	True
1375844709.0	1jux07	Murderer in the woods	coldbeeronsunday	176	21	21	"After finding this subreddit today, and after having posted a very abridged version of this story a couple of times in other threads, I asked my mom for the detailed version of the story and thought I'd share with you kind people.

This happened circa 1971 or 1972, when my mother was about 14 or 15 years old. The incident occurred in a heavily wooded area near Montevallo, Alabama (close to Birmingham). 

My mother is the oldest of 5 children - she has 3 sister and a brother, who is the baby of the family. One weekend in the cooler months of the fall, my grandfather decided to take the whole family - my grandmother, my mother, and all my aunts and uncles, so seven people total - into the woods for target practice with a rifle. My mother grew up quite poor and they didn't always live in the best neighborhoods, so my grandfather wanted to teach the kids how to defend themselves with the rifle if need be. 

Like I said, it was later in the fall, so the trees were bare and there were lots of leaves on the ground. The wooded area was just off a dirt road, so this was a fairly rural area they were in. Since it was so far off the beaten path, my grandfather became startled when he heard the roar of a car engine so deep in the woods. My mom remembers the car as being a blue Ford Galaxie, so it looked something like this: http://i.imgur.com/PZw8qfH.jpg. 

Despite the fact that my grandfather had a gun, he totally freaked out and told my grandma and the kids to hide under a pile of leaves in the woods. He hid with them. The man in the driver's seat got out, dragged a woman's body out of the car, and just dumped her there in the woods and drove away. After my grandfather was sure the man had gone, everyone came out of hiding and the woman sat up and stared them straight in the face. My grandfather asked the woman if she needed help. She said no, she would be fine. She didn't seem to be injured and obviously didn't want help - she hadn't put up a fight with the man when he was dragging her out of the car (she must have known him?) - so my grandfather cut the shooting lesson short and decided to rush the kids home to safety. 

Well, on the trail back to the dirt road where my grandfather had parked their car, they passed the man in the blue Ford Galaxie driving out of the woods. My mom looked over and noticed that he had a *huge* machete laying across the front seats right beside him. My grandfather made sure that the man could see that he was carrying a rifle, but everyone was careful not to give away what they had just seen. The man struck up small talk with my grandfather, asked him how he was doing and what they were doing out in the woods. My grandfather explained that he had just taken his family out for some target practice with the rifle. The man told him to have a nice a day and continued driving. 

The next day, my grandfather went back out to that spot in the woods. There was not a body there. However, he did find the woman's wig, her purse, some Kleenex, and a pair of eyeglasses. He collected the items and took them home. According to my grandfather, that area of the woods was known for having shallow graves and being a dumping site for bodies. My mother became hysterical when he walked in the door carrying that stuff, she started screaming ""He killed that lady! He killed that lady!"" My grandfather ended up taking the items to the police station, but my mom doesn't think anything ever came of it - she never heard anything else about it after that.

Well, she did hear one other thing about it, I guess. Early the next morning, my grandmother called my mom when she arrived at work, just before the kids left for school. She told them not to take the bus that day, that she would come home and pick them up and drive them to school. When my mom asked why, my grandmother said, ""Because that car is waiting for you at the bus stop."""	t5_2t3t8	True
1374854414.0	1j3qbz	The Train, the Men, and the Lighter		195	37	27	"Two weeks ago I went out to pick up some groceries to make myself and my sister some supper. It's summertime and pleasantly hot, so I was wearing shorts and a t-shirt-- standard summertime fare for the average young woman. My parents were out, and they'd taken the car, so I took the light-rail transit, basically an above-ground subway, to the end of the line three stops down, where there is a massive condo development and a new grocery store.



I bought the food, walked back on to the train, and sat down. Because it's the end of the line, you can get on the train and wait for about 10 minutes before it starts up again on the schedule. I was listening to music quite loudly on my headphones (because honestly, I don't have any interest in listening to the screaming babies/other people's conversations/etc.) After about two minutes, a group of four girls, who were all probably about fourteen or fifteen years old, sat down across from me. They were also dressed in the clothes typical of young women in the summertime: tank tops, shorts, etc.



A few more minutes passed, and two men entered the same car from the platform. Both are fairly disheveled: one is probably in his mid-thirties, absolutely filthy, shirtless, and clearly drunk/high. The other looked younger, and was dressed in more typical clothing, but was equally filthy.



Despite the train car being nearly empty, with plenty of seats-- there were only me, the four girls, and an elderly couple at the far end of the car-- the shirtless man flopped down on the floor and lay there. That wasn't surprising in itself: there are plenty of homeless people who use public transit, and aside from his smell, he wasn't bothering anyone. The other man, however, approached the group of young girls and started talking to them.




Initially, because I had my headphones in, I couldn't hear what he was saying, but after I saw the general discomfort in their faces I paused my music and listened. ""Hey!"" he called out to no one in particular. ""Why don't you take your shirt off and show me your tits?"" One of the girls laughed nervously but they all remained motionless. We were still waiting in the station for the train to pull out. As they sat there, he rapidly became more and more agitated. I should emphasize once more that these young girls were clearly no older than fifteen. They were terrified, and even though he hadn't turned around to look at me, so was I.



""Come on!"" He yelled, ""Just show me them. It's not a big deal. Just one. Just one titty. Just *one.*"" He was shouting now, and his friend on the ground was moaning, as though he was in pain. The shouting man reached out to grab the arm of the girls, and in unison they all stood up and ran off of the train. I thought about doing the same, but the train doors closed, and the chime sounded, indicating that we were leaving the station.



In an effort to be proactive, I picked up my groceries and sat down at the far end of the car, near the elderly couple. Predictably, the shouting man followed me, and sat immediately beside me, his dirty pants brushing my leg. I shuffled over a little more but remained silent, as though I hadn't heard anything he had said to the girls. (Following my mother's cardinal rule of creepy situations: never engage crazy.)



The train clicked on for another few seconds-- it's about three minutes between stations-- before the shouting man pulled out a lighter and began playing with it. He flicked the flame on and off, over and over, talking about how those other girls were ""skank bitches."" I pretended not to hear him. After what must have been about thirty seconds, he ""dropped"" his lighter on the ground immediately next to my foot.



His dirty hand grazed my leg as he reached down to grab it, and I shuddered-- it had a *stickiness* about it which could only be described as repugnant. Then, as he slowly leaned back while holding the lighter, he clicked the flint and brought the open flame towards my exposed leg, beaming widely. ""You've got a hair there, and I'm just going to get it for you,"" he said. 



Needless to say, I shot up. I considered moving down the car, but there was still at least a minute before we would arrive at the next station, and clearly he intended to follow me again. I swallowed hard, took my headphones off (which hadn't been playing for a few minutes, now), looked him dead in the face-- which was still beaming-- and said, ""Can I help you with something?"" 



I mentally kicked myself as soon as I said it, because it was just about the most feeble thing I could have said to a man who had just attempted to burn my flesh, but it seemed to throw him for a second. His smile faded. I kept my eyes locked to his, trying to keep him still for a moment. After what seemed like hours, the train pulled into the station. 



The chime sounded and I ran like hell, on to the platform and as many cars down as I could, to the first car of the train. Panting, I sat down, and looked around to make sure there was no trace of either man. Clearly, they hadn't switched cars. I breathed a sigh of relief, and continued the remaining two stops home.



When I got out at my stop, I had to walk the entire length of the platform to get to the exit, because I'd sat in the front car. I looked down the platform and saw the two of them exiting the car and my heart stopped. The shirtless man was leaning against a garbage can and the shouting man was still muttering things to himself, wildly gesticulating and shaking. I stood still, hoping that they wouldn't notice me in the two-dozen or so people on the platform.



Fortunately, they didn't... As they proceeded to board the train going in the opposite direction. They had boarded at the end of the line, gone three stops, and then gone back in the direction of the end of the line, apparently with no end in sight. 

Even with my arms full of groceries, I sprinted the rest of the way home."	t5_2t3t8	True
1365789725.0	1c7xe7	My dads girlfriend was almost picked up by Ted Bundy	snowbum1231	214	55	35	"I saw someone else post a Ted Bundy story and thought i would share one. Not a long story, but chilling. When my dads girlfriend was in high school in the seventies, she decided to ditch school one day to shop at the local mall. This was in Colorado, and a few days prior to his capture. 

Anyway, she was leaving the mall, headed to the parking lot to her car and was stopped by a handsome young man. He approached her asking if she would be interested in modeling, as he was posing as a photographer. For whatever reason she felt something was a little odd about him, and was feeling bad about ditching school, so politely declined and kept walking to her car. She said that she might have accepted his offer if she hasn't had a weird feeling. 

She said she couldn't shake the feeling of how ""off"" the whole situation felt. She eventually realized she had a near brush with death when a few days later he was arrested and brought to a jail only a few hours from where he had approached her. He actually escaped from that jail, and ended up abducting a girl and killing her, and dumped her body on the side of the road in the town I live in, and I drive on that road pretty frequently.

I live in what we call a villa, where there is a long driveway that leads to 15 houses at the end of a long road. My house is designed in a 'circular' way in which the kitchen and dining area are walled off from the three bedrooms/toilet but you can walk in circles around the house and end up at the same spot.


We have 3 cars in our family since the 3 members drive but I don't yet and my dad parks his station wagon in this visitors parking. From my kitchen window you have an excellent view of this parking area, great lighting and just an all round good view.

One night my family went out and took my mums car to a restaurant in the city. I was just at home watching a movie when around 10:30pm there was a knock on the screen door.

""Who is it?"" I called.

""..oh... its your neighbour. I.. oh..Your dad left his car lights on.""

I opened my door, thank god my screen door was locked. There stood a man I had never seen before and we hadn't had any new residents move in either. He looked kind of nervous and he repeated 
""Your dad or brother left his car lights on in the parking spaces. You really should come out and turn them off""

""oh okay, thank you for that I'll let him know when he comes home."" He didn't move, didn't flinch. Just stared.

""You should.. you should come out now and turn them off, its going to kill his battery""

I repeated again that I would tell my dad when he came home and he repeated that I really should, right now, at that moment come out with him and turn the car off.
I told him I was going to call my dad right now and tell him about the car lights and he began to walk away. I closed the door, locked it and then went around to the backdoor and essentially barricaded that with locks and some chairs.

After I placed a butcher knife underneath my coffee table I went to the kitchen to look at the car spaces. My dads car lights weren't on and the parking area was pitch black.
I never saw that man again."	t5_2t3t8	True
1368273604.0	1e4i26	"""I could kill you, if I wanted to."""	Janeismyname_	184	28	19	"This is the story my mother has always told to my sister and
      I whenever we meet a new boy, and I just discovered this
      subreddit and thought I'd share.


      When my mother was 27 years old, she illegally came to the US
      from the Soviet Union with $400 and not a single word of
      English. Finding work was very difficult for her then, no
      business wanted a woman who couldn't even talk to their
      customers, no matter how hard working or loyal she was. For a
      year she lifted boxes at a large supermarket into a truck,
      back breaking, endearing work, before she discovered the
      jewelry store. It was in the downtown of my city, well
      respected and popular, albeit small. She applied to work
      there and miraculously got the job.


      The shop was owned by what she described as ""a quiet, older,
      rough and friendly man, but with strange eyes"". My mother
      never really got a weird vibe from him, and he was a Russian
      immigrant as well, so it was nice to talk to someone in her
      native tongue. My mother and this man got along well enough,
      although he was 20 years older than her and unmarried. One
      day, after work, he asked her if she would like to go for a
      ride in his new car. My mother accepted (why not? He was just
      a nice older man who wanted to be seen riding with a pretty
      young girl, nothing too strange about that.) and they walked
      outside and got into the red convertible.


      He drove not around the little roads in my city, but instead
      the bigger, crowded ones, as if he had somewhere to be that
      he was in a hurry to get to. Then he came to a large
      intersection and went straight on to the highway. By this
      time my mother was beginning to feel a little apprehensive.
      She knew no one, had informed no one, that she was going out.
      No one would miss her if she didn't come home for supper on
      time. After driving for about a half hour on the highway, my
      mother silently opened the glove compartment on a hunch. She
      always told me that she still isn't sure why she opened the
      glove compartment, perhaps to look for a weapon, perhaps a
      nagging suspicion, but inside the compartment was three
      things- a rope, a long knife, and a map.


      My mother closed the compartment and said nothing. She wasn't
      sure what to do, they were speeding down an unfamiliar
      highway and she was alone. Then the man turned to her and
      very casually said in Russian ""I could kill you if I wanted
      to.""


      My mother, 5""5, petite, and blonde hair blue eyed responded,
      ""I don't think you should try that, I am trained in self
      defense and karate. Please take me home now.""


      She had never had a self defense class in her life.


      They didn't say much for the remainder of the ride.
      Eventually the man turned onto a dark, unpaved road, much to
      my mothers horror, but from here he only turned around and
      drove the hour back to my town. My mother worked at the
      jewelry store for another 3 years, trying to limit her
      contact with the owner as best she could. They still say
      hello on the occasion, just as if that afternoon never
      happened.


      My mother would always conclude the story with ""So be back by
      no later than 9:00, but perhaps you shouldn't go out tonight
      with that boy after all. You never know who someone might
      be.""

1369880620.0	1fb7vn	The woman in the wedding dress	MightyMishy	185	27	16	"I apologize in advanced for any errors, I'm posting this on my phone quickly before work.


Also this isn't really scary but definitely creepy.


I'm a 26 yr old female with a 16 yr old brother and have lived in queens, NY my whole life. 10 years ago (for those too lazy to do math I was 16 and my brother 6) I decided to take my brother to a massive street fair on a main street that stretched very far. The street was shut down, there were some scattered officers of the law and everything else was street vendors and some awesomely shitty little carnival rides for kids. A group of my friends joined us, in total there were 10 of us. After having a fun filled afternoon introducing my brother to the deep fried goodness of zeppolis and what not we went to a pizzaria right by the fair.


The place wasn't wide but was long. The booths that lined the wall on the right sat 3 people on each side then there was a narrow aisle and booths that sat 2 people on each side on the right. Being a half decent big sister I had my brother in the (in total) 6 seater booth in between me and a friend (we took up 2 6 seater booths and one 4 seater) 

this is where things start to get kinda creepy...


in walks a man and woman who genuinely looked like they did way too many drugs. They were probably in their late 50s early 60s. We wouldn't have noticed them if it wasn't for the fact that the woman was wearing a wedding dress. Long sleeves, puffy at the shoulders and long but sort of form fitting in a way. This dress however must have been once white but was now yellowed from age and very dirty. She sat with the man parallel to our booth, our other friends sitting behind them and a young couple with their 3/4 yr old daughter in front. 

The woman looked around, spotted my brother and begins to talk to him. ""You're adorable, how'd you like to come home with me?"" My brother has always been a bright kid and ignores her, eating his pizza. ""Come on little boy you don't want to be around these teens"" I nicely turn to face the lady and ask her politely to leave us alone. She stands up and comes to our table and tries to reach over to touch my brother when my friend stands up and blocks her. She goes and sits down and starts harassing the young couple and their daughter. 

After about 10 minutes my brother announces he has to potty (the bathroom is a one person only type deal) so when my brother stands up and heads for the bathroom 5 steps away the woman asks him if he'd like her to help. At this point I tell her to fuck off and leave my brother alone, she tries to push past me and rush to my brother in the bathroom but another friend is standing in front of the door basically guarding him. She curses me out and sits down. As soon as he comes back out I pick him up and carry him out. She's trying to grab him from me but there's 10 of us and one of her. We go to the nearest officer and tell him what's up and he runs to the pizzaria. 


Come to find out she actually abducted a kid from the fair but when the child started screaming bloody murder she put him/her down and ran.

Needless to say, mace is my new best friend."	t5_2t3t8	True
1357363142.0	15zsn2	My mothers words probably saved my life	peanut7710	186	33	30	"I was a young girl about five or six years old at the time. I lived in the city of Long Beach California, and this took place at my Elementary School at the time. 

My lovely mom always told me not to talk to strangers, to not accept candy or anything from someone I do not know and who knew I would ever come across a situation where that advise would have probably saved my life.

It was an ordinary day, I got ready for school, as always I was excited to go to my first grade class because I loved my teacher Ms. Vasquez. As usual my mother would walk me to school since it wasn't a far walk maybe five or six blocks away. It was a pretty safe area. My school was close to down town , by the beach so it wasn't a bad neighborhood but criminal activity wasn't rare to see. So anyways I go to class do the usual and before I know it the bell rings it was 2:30 pm and I was happy to be out and walk to the front of the school where I would always meet my mom.

My school was in a street which during school hours they would close it and no veichles were allowed to come in. It was until after school where they would open the gate and allow parents to come to the front in their cars to pick up their children.

So back to the story, I was waiting for my mom, I was looking around to see if I saw her but no luck, she was always on time but not that day. As I was looking for her a man maybe in his mid twentys stepped out of a black four door car, he didn't look creepy or anything but I noticed there was three other men in the car inside waiting. The man then approached me, Im guessing me since I looked lost and was alone even though there was alot of kids and parents around since school had just got out, but I was standing by myself with no adult clearly with me. He then told me that my mother had sent him to pick me up, that he had candy, balloons, and a lot of toys for me to play with while I waited for my mom to go and get me back. I was young but I automatically sensed something was wrong, not just wrong, but bad, something horrible was about to happen to me. As I looked at him with doubt he immediately went for my hand and grabbed it, I took a quick glance at the background to see one of the guys had opened the cars backseat door and as soon as I saw that I took my hand off his, at the same time kicking his knee and yelling No! As soon as I let go I ran, I ran as fast as i could without stopping or looking back to my teachers classroom where I told her what had just happened.

She then called my mother which of course didn't answer since no one was home and she was on her way to pick me up. She was only less then five minutes late but thats all it couldve taken for me to be gone.

They informed her what happened as well as the principle and police. They sent letters to everyones parents in the school to be on the lookout of this men. No one got a chance to get license plates number or anything, probably no one even saw what was going on since it was loud and crowdy.

I still wonder what their intentions were and what they were planning to do. I'm just glad that at the moment I heard my moms advice in the back of my head and didn't go with him. They never found him nor did I ever come across him again."	t5_2t3t8	True
1343947542.0	xl7wp	Hotel handyman	IHateCircusMidgets	181	22	12	"This is one of the two creepiest stories from my aunt's tenure as the general manager of a fairly busy hotel in the Sacramento, CA area (the other is arguably paranormal-ish, and not relevant to this sub).    
    
It was an otherwise normal and quiet weeknight when a guest called the front desk to ask if they had sent someone to check on her air conditioning, as there was a maintenance worker outside her door who said he needed to come in and work on it.  It's hot in Sacramento, and she'd been using the air conditioning that day; it seemed fine and she got a bad vibe, so she called to check.
    
The hotel hadn't sent anyone.  The front desk attendant told her to lock her door as thoroughly as possible, called security, and they rushed to her room.  The guy was gone.  The guest told them that she'd had a fairly quiet night:  she'd gone out to dinner, come back to the hotel, relaxed in the hot tub for awhile and then headed back to her room, and twenty or so minutes later the guy knocked on her door.    
    
The hotel staff went to review the security footage and eventually found the tape of her sitting in the hot tub, alone.  They watched her get out, then watched as, about ten seconds later, a guy climbed out from behind some nearby bushes and went off in the same direction she had.    
    
They weren't able to identify (or find) the guy, and never had another report of a fake handyman."	t5_2t3t8	True
1342934887.0	wyfym	Murder at the Lookout	Gertiel	178	23	27	"My ex and I, then still together, were having some difficulties and had gone to visit family at a small town in east Texas. On Saturday evening, everyone kind of ended up going off to do various things or just plonking in front of the TV, and we decided to go get a shake and find somewhere to sit and talk. Near town there is a lookout point where people often go to talk and ...other things. It was not yet dusk when we left the house, so we figured to talk a bit and be home before the other things really got going.

We picked up our shakes and arrived just about dusk. We passed an empty parked pickup toward the beginning of the parking area and parked just by one of the covered picnic tables. It was hot, so our windows were rolled down. I thought I saw the glow of a lighted cigarette at a covered table deeper in the trees, but wasn't certain as it wasn't completely dark and so hard to be sure.

As we were talking, not really paying a lot of attention to what was going on around us, darkness fell. Although there were some lights, in the pitch darkness under the trees they did little. As was usual, our talk went round the same way and we eventually fell silent, knowing there wasn't going to be anything said we hadn't already said anyway.

In the silence, we each looked out our windows and realized we were still out there with only an empty pickup truck. As I was looking down along the way to the pickup, which was parked a short way down on my side, a sudden feeling of apprehension overtook me. The hair on the back of my neck stood up straight, and my brain screamed at me to get out, someone is looking at you with evil intent. I turned and asked that we drive out now. Weirdly, although such a request would normally have brought on all sorts of annoying questions such as drive where and why, probably just to annoy me, he complied immediately. As he was starting the car, he tersely ordered me to raise my window and then drove off as fast as he could go. After we got back out on the main road, he told me about feeling someone starring at us in a way that made the hair on the back of his neck stand up causing him to want to leave.

The following day, we found out a man was murdered at the Lookout, probably just before we arrived. The suspect was eventually arrested driving a pickup described as looking exactly like the one we saw parked and empty. By that time, he had shot some other people as well. There didn't seem to be a real reason for any of the shootings, according to the locals, and it was thought he had gone nuts and simply shot people because the voices in his head said to or whatever.

1334567382.0	sc5lp	[My] First Job	BingyBingaBing	182	24	23	"I've been on reddit for a while now, and I figured I'd go ahead and post this story.  To get this straight, I haven't thought about this for a very long time, I pushed it out of my mind but there are nights like these where I just have to get it out.

Anyways, I was 17 at the time, on the way to being 18 and I had landed my first job at a mail sorting place thanks to my neighbor.  Back then, being payed 7.75 an hour at my age was the biggest, not to mention, all I had to do was fill out a few pieces of paper and I got the job.  No interview either.  They loved my neighbor and the guy who hired me was really cool.  (I called him Dad.)

First day of work, I met a girl named Jennifer.  She was at least several months pregnant, and basically took me through the entire flat, showed me how things worked, instructed me on how to sort and the best way to do it.  It was really boring work, so she kept talking to me and we hit it off pretty well.  I was a borderline recluse, I think she kind of knew that, and I was raising children and around pregnant people all the time so I was able to talk to her about my experiences and how I felt about doing that sort of stuff.

We had another cool boss by the name of Jerome, and on my first day, we all piled in his car and he took me home.  It was then i realized that i desperately needed a car, or someone to pick me up from work because I was going to work late hours as per the schedule.  (Yes, it was illegal for me to work those hours, but I digress.)

My birthday rolled around and I was getting friendly and finally being open with most of the people there.  I learned the ropes really well, even worked in departments that needed more help because I usually was done earlier than I needed.  People actually took me to lunch and brought me things back, sometimes I'd buy people something to eat when they were down on their luck.  It was like a little family, but I didn't know how much.

Jerome worked with his wife, I can't remember her name, but she was the sister of Jennifer.  Which in turn, made Jennifer a sister in law to Jerome.  Jerome's cousin soon started working there, and time and time again he tried to get my number, knowing full well I was underage at the time.  I resisted because, he wasn't my type and he was already married, I found him disgusting.  But we were all pretty much a cool group of co-workers that hung out a lot.

A few months passed, I turned 18, valentines day rolled around and we all decided to go out for drinks.  I wasn't much of a drinker, and I knew it was illegal, but I went anyways and had fun.  Got drunk as hell too.  Jenny had her baby and she was out on the prowl looking for a guy, so I found one that she actually was kindly too and I exchanged numbers for them.  We all danced, went to Denny's, they walked me to the door and made sure I was safe and sound.

Possibly a week or two later, Jenny didn't show up to work.  She wasn't answering her phone or returning phone calls or messages, it was like she dropped off the face of the earth.

Jerome, her sister (his wife), and one of the managers (this is all what I heard) decided to go to her house to check on her, and when they did, they found her dead.  She was laying on her bed, throat slit, the baby was strangled and dumped in the laundry bin.  When we found out, everyone was heartbroken.  It was bad.  

The police came in and questioned everyone, they pulled me to the side last and showed me a bunch of pictures, questioned me about the night we went out drinking, harassed me to the point of crying about the entire thing.  I had to call my sister to pick me up from work because I couldn't handle it the rest of the day.  Thanks to my sister and everyone else close to me who I talked to the death about, word got around my high school that I set Jenny up with a murderer.

A week or so after the questioning, Jerome came to me to vent, which was highly unusual, saying that the guy I hooked her up with wanted to move in with her, etc.  Just basically getting angry about it all.  I understood his anger because that was his sister in law, but I didn't know why he wanted to tell me about it.  Then he asked if I had a ride home, and I really didn't, I was going to walk, so I told him no.  He said he'd take me home and we'd talk more about it later.  I really didn't think much of it.

That night, work was ending and everyone was filtering out.  I got into the car with Jerome, but.. turns out, his car wouldn't start.  So we had to get a ride from another co-worker and all was well.

A few days after that, Dad came up to us and gathered us around and told us that Jerome was arrested for the murder of Jenny.  Apparently, he slept with Jenny and had gotten her pregnant.  She refused to have an abortion, deciding to keep the child, which would add to his two that he already had with his sister.  She wanted to name him so she could get benefits, but he didn't agree with it.  So he went to the car to leave, but then came back and killed her and the baby.

One of the workers there, started to scream and yell at me for getting into the car with him, saying that he planned to kill her because she knew that he was the baby's father, and that he was going to kill me because he thought I knew.  

I really didn't.  It was all a total shock.  Dad pulled me to the side and gave me a hug, and I was allowed to go back to work after a little break.

Things pretty much went downhill after that.  Jerome's cousin kept pleading his innocence, while saying that he misses us and he did no wrong.  His attorneys cooked up a defense saying that some guys in a black suburban made him do it.  It was just damn weird.  I couldn't work there anymore, I got out of there fast.  It pretty much fucked me up until this day.  Anyways, that's how my first job went.  I recently went to look up news articles for this story and I googled his name, he has a penpal profile up now, and it made me sick to my stomach.

Please forgive the way I told this story, I hadn't slept yet and I doubt I will tonight."	t5_2t3t8	True

My parents usually take me and my siblings on numerous outdoor camping sites and I had great memories, except for one particular outing. It was at the Poconos in Pennsylvania were there were a lot of sites we went to.  However on this trip we rented out cabins instead of pitching tents.  I was ok with it.  When we were all settled in our cabin my parents and my siblings were inside chatting, planning the weekend and eating.  But me being a sporty kid took my baseball bat and some baseballs and went outside.  In front of our cabin was a huge circle of just open grass.  I threw some baseballs in the air and proceeded to hit them.  About ten minutes in a dark green car rolls up a few feet behind me to where I was standing.  Mind you, there are other cabins in the area so I thought it was just a family lost and wanted to ask where their cabin was.  But when the windows rolled down it was some middle-aged guy and I remembered the inside of his car was pretty dirty.  He said 

""Hey kid you're not allowed to play baseball here.""  

At this point I knew this dude was shady, because he doesn't drive the white pick-up trucks with the campsite logo so he wasn't security.  And he had an ultra-creepy smile.  I just said ""oh"" but he got really creepy when he said, 

""There's a baseball field on the top of that hill, (he pointed) I can take you there..it'll be fun"" then he gave a creepy smile and beckoned me to get in.   

Now shit got real. I gripped my aluminum bat tighter and made a sort of scowling face.  He saw this, and I swear he was about to open the car.  Until he heard and saw my dad laughing and coming out of the cabin talking to someone on his cellphone.  The creepy part was that he didn't get angry, the dude looks at me gives me a smile and a face that said ""I'll get you next time.."" and drives away.  I sprinted to my cabin and from then on clung to my parents and kept my baby brother and adolescent sister close to me at all times for the whole entire weekend.  Never told them about the guy. 

Oh and I checked the campsite map on our drive home.  There was no baseball field on the top of that hill that this creep was talking about.  Instead there was a picnic table and next it to dense woods and a creek.

1364066697.0	1avg5m	Bangs in the Night	supermassivemuser	177	23	17	"This happened to me a few days ago (female).

My mum and stepdad were going out for the night, so after they left I brought some snacks to my room and sat at the computer on reddit and listened to pandora. Nothing out of the ordinary happened for a few hours and I never left my room. 

At around 11:30 I heard a loud bang from outside, maybe in the street somewhere. It was loud enough for me to jump, and it was followed by silence. I wrote it off as a car, or some dumbass kids and ignored it. It happened a few more times, but I didn't really care. Then I heard a bang on my porch. It sounded like someone jumped up in the air and purposely stomped downward to make a loud *thud*. 

I was a little creeped, and turned my music off in order to listen. I heard it again and ran to my window. Unfortunately, I couldn't see my porch that well from my window, so after a few minutes of looking around I headed to my bedroom door to try the guest room window. All of a sudden something banged on my bedroom door and made it shake. I screamed and grabbed my swiss army knife (belonged to my grandpa, purely to remember him by). I shouted out ""I have a weapon! Get the fuck out of my house!"". I didn't hear anything for the longest time, and I slowly opened the door to check if anyone was there. The hallway was empty. 
I checked the whole house, it was empty. But the door was open a hair. By now I was more pissed than scared because my mum said she had locked the door before she left (obviously she didn't). I called her up and told her what happened. Not only did she admit to leaving the door unlocked, but she was pissed that I called because ""I ruined her night with my stupid overactive imagination"". 

Joke was on her, the next day my neighbours reported similar occurrences. Someone had made banging noises outside their house, broke in, stole some stuff, and killed their cat."	t5_2t3t8	True
1362861380.0	19zje3	Creepy guy repeatedly asking for my phone number	GodivaDevice	172	20	36	"I've been debating whether or not to post this for a while now, I hope this isn't too rambling or incoherent...

To start, this happened about eight, nine years ago when I was 14. Because my school was quite far from home and my Mum didn't drive, I got a bus part of the way home and then walked the rest of the way. No big deal, I did this every day. What made this day different was the guy who stopped me.

He was tall, looked to be in his mid-thirties and had a Nigerian accent. First he asked me what time it was, I said I wasn't sure but about 2:45pm (my school finished ridiculously early). Nothing too unusual. Then he starts walking down the road with me, asking what high school I go to (the name is on my school jumper), what time the school finishes and so on. 

I'm feeling a little unnerved so I duck into a corner shop and browse around for about ten minutes before buying a chocolate bar. I didn't want to stay too long in case the owner thought I was a thief or something, and by this time I thought the guy would be long gone. 

Nope. He's still out there, talking to someone on his phone. I walk a little faster, hoping he hasn't noticed me. He hangs up, catches up with me, starts asking for my phone number. I lie and tell him I don't have a phone, he asks again. I tell him again, sorry but I don't have a phone. He asks for paper so he can give me his number and then I can call him, which he seems pretty insistent upon. 

By this point I'm feeling a little sick. This guy's way taller than me, in his mid thirties and won't stop following me. It doesn't help that the road I walk down is quite industrialised, plenty of construction sites and dark alleyways he could drag me off to.

The guy backs off a little now which eases my apprehension, but I continue to power-walk down the road just in case.

Anyway, imagine my relief when my Grandad pulls up (he usually finished work about the same time I finished school, and knew the route I took home) just at that moment. I quickly get into the car, trying not to show how freaked out I am, berating myself a little. Maybe the guy was just being friendly? Maybe it was a cultural thing, he didn't see anything wrong with exchanging phone numbers with a teenage girl.

That thought goes straight out the window when I turn to face the road. Another car had just pulled in front of my Grandad's, and the guy that had been bothering me opens the passenger door and gets in, all the while GLARING at me through the windscreen.

If looks could kill I'd have been buried twice-over. Jeez, it's been almost ten years and I still get chills when I picture the wide-eyed hateful look on his face. I honestly think if my Grandad hadn't shown up when he did, I'd have been dragged into that car never to be heard of again."	t5_2t3t8	True
1359500336.0	17iwe0	Mall Rapist	smallkitten	184	32	30	"This is not the first time I was stalked when I was younger but it was the scariest.


My senior year of high school and all throughout my winter and summer breaks from college I worked at a kiosk in my hometown's mall that was associated with a local tattoo shop. We sold body jewelry and lighters and random crap like that. I really liked the job, I felt cool because people thought I was cool for working there and because my job was to convince them to buy way overpriced body jewelry, which I happened to be good at.


On this particular day I was home for summer break after my freshman year of college and working at the kiosk one afternoon. My brother was graduating from middle school that day and I was waiting for my shift to end and for my parents to come pick me up to go to the ceremony. During the summer, usually only one person worked a shift unless it was a Friday or Saturday night since most people were out at the beach or doing outdoor activities. As my shift was ending it suddenly became very busy and I was scrambling to help all the various customers. An older guy came up to the stand and asked for a business card. I handed him one and didn't pay him much attention-- after all, he was walking away, I had already given him what he wanted and he kept his head down so I went back to helping the other customers. A few minutes later the phone rang to my store and I answered it-- ""Hello this is smallkitten thank you for calling [Tattoo Shop] how can I help you?"" The voice on the other line told me that he was the man who had just stopped and asked for a business card. I immediately thought that was weird-- why didn't he just ask me whatever it was while he was here? But his next sentence cleared it up pretty quickly for me. ""I was wondering if you'd like to go out with me sometime."" I said thank you and that I was flattered but I would have to decline and ended the conversation. I left to go meet my parents and didn't think of it again.


A few days later I was working alone again when the phone rang and I answered as always. ""Hello this is smallkitten thank you for calling [Tattoo Shop] how can I help you?"" It was the same man from the other day, asking me out yet again. I again told him that it was very nice of him to ask me but that I was not interested. 


""Well then I'll be waiting for you when you get out of work so I can rape you, you fucking bitch.""


I didn't even know what to do. I hung up the phone and did my best to not start sobbing, as I was again working alone. Fortunately because of the nature of my job, lots of really sweet but very scary looking mall rats hung out around my store, and my very tall, very dreadlocked, very facially-pierced friend stood at my work with me all day while I called the police and my boss. I filed a milion reports but there was really nothing anyone could do if I didn't see him actually do anything. Unfortunately his face was hazy to me because he had approached me with his head down and during a time when I was attending to other customers and I constantly wondered if he was actually in the mall, staring at me or even talking to me and I wouldn't even know it.


This guy continued to call and harass all of the female employees that worked at my store for almost a year with sexual threats. Everyone was escorted to their car at the end of the night by mall security and this continued for long after I went back to school. By the end of the summer I had regressed to wearing only baggy clothes and sweats with very little makeup because I didn't want to attract any extra attention to myself. Even though this happened close to ten years ago I still don't feel comfortable wearing tight or revealing clothes."	t5_2t3t8	True
1347835712.0	zzqom	Mine	SaccharinePernicious	189	33	23	"So this story was on /r/nosleep but I ended up deleting it since nothing paranormal actually happened and I didn't really think it fit in that category.

I was about 14 at the time, in fact it all started about a few months after my 14th birthday. I was really good friends with this girl that I met during 7th grade. When we met, we instantly clicked, we pretty much had the same interests in everything and there really wasn't a “friend to best friend” stage, it just jumped from not knowing each other to best friends.

Anyways, during that time I came to realize that my friend was a really big fan of a “famous” singer. The reason why I say “famous” is because he was known, but not extremely well known, he usually would just have small shows around where he lived and the surrounding states and there would only be about a hundred or so people attending his concert.

I was pretty excited when I heard that she knew who he was and I explained to her that I already met him three different times. He was a really chill dude and he actually communicated with his fans, unlike most of the singers today who most of the time give you a nod or a wave and leave. In fact, at the end of his shows you usually could just walk up and talk to him for a few minutes at the back of the building.

Just like any fan girl she immediately asked me if I could take her to meet him. I told her that the next time he came to our state I'd see what I could do. I just want to explain something very quickly. I do not know this singer personally, Me and him aren't friends, I don't have his phone number, street address, email or anything that allows me to be able to contact him directly. My boyfriend during the time was in a band, and would often play shows throughout the state. Anyways, him being in a band gave him advantages, he got to meet a lot of really famous bands and singers and being his girlfriend during the time I would often go to his shows and get to meet the other bands after the concert. That is the only way I got to meet him that many times.

So three months go by. My friend comes running up to me telling me that he is going to be playing in my state in three weeks and we need to get tickets immediately. So I get the tickets the same day, which was pretty easy considering that he still wasn't well known and that my boyfriend could help me out.

Though eventually I started to realize that my friend started to grow an obsession over him. I didn't really think much about it then, I just thought it was normal for any teenage girl so I shrugged it off. 

I did find it annoying at the time though because she would always talk about him. When I say always, I mean it, she would somehow get him into the topic even though what we were talking about had absolutely nothing to do with him. I'd understand if his name came up if we were talking about music but his name would come up if I was talking about my family or friends or what me and her were going to do this weekend. It was crazy.

Fast forward to three weeks and it was the day of the concert. I apologize for all the time skips but I don't want to bore you with all the unnecessary details. 

So the plan was that she was going to come over my house, my parents would drive us there, drop us off and pick us up thirty minutes after the concert is over that way we had enough time to say hi and talk to him. The concert was amazing like I expected and every one flooded out of the doors, most not even stopping to meet him.

As my friend and I approached him she was spazzing out, jumping up and down squealing, pretty much everything crazy fangirls do. He was outside of the building that he just preformed in with the rest of his band members (he was in a band, but she just liked him, the lead singer) smoking a cigarette. Now he was and is a really attractive guy. He had really long hair probably five or six inches past his shoulders, I couldn't never tell if his hair was really dark brown or just black. He isn't a really tall guy, maybe 5'6 or 5'7 but it suited him. He immediately acknowledged us, in fact he actually remembered who I was and asked about my boyfriend (him and my boyfriend actually hung out a couple times). I talked to him for about a minute or so until my friend started just spewing stuff out at him. I can't remember everything that she said but I know most of it was pretty nasty. Like all the stuff she wanted to do with him, that she was in love with him, she wanted to have his babies. Stuff like that.

Being the kind of guy he was he just awkwardly laughed it off. I knew he was uncomfortable by the way he held himself and his body language. I remembered I tried to make my friend be quiet a few times but she just waved me off and told me she knew what she was doing.
She then started to scream at him that he had to marry her or she would commit suicide that night, and that him and her were soul mates. At this point he wasn't really saying anything but he didn't walk away either, he just kind of stood there. But when he didn't reply to her demands of marriage she flipped out more and started to hysterically cry.

At that point I knew that I needed to take her away from him and quickly. She was kind of bend down and keeping her face hidden. I attempted to grab her arm and pull her away from him but she yanked her arm away, sprinted to him (I swear I never have seen someone move that fast that quickly) and actually somehow managed to pull some of his hair out. It wasn't a large amount of hair that left a bald spot on his head but it was a good amount. She then shoved it into her jeans pocket and started to walk away.

After what she did I swore I was going to have a heart attack. Honestly at that point in time I don't think either him or me really knew what happened. I was really flustered and at some point I remember crying because I was scared. Interestingly enough he didn't call the cops. I found it really hard to believe he didn't given the situation we were in. I probably apologized to him a billion times before I left to find my friend but still to this day I still sincerely feel bad for what my friend did to him.

Oh but that is not the end, in fact it is just the beginning. The drive home was extremely awkward and during that time I refused to talk to her because of how upset I was. But a few days later, after the intense anger I was feeling toward her ended we started to talk again. She would not stop texting me and calling me so I gave in.

Shortly after the incident she then started to explain how she would see him all the time and how she believed he was stalking her. She would tell me how he would come to her in her dreams and tell her that he loved her so much and they were meant to be together. Sometimes she would even tell me he would sneak into her room late at night and sleep with her (I don't know what she meant by “sleep” I never really needed or wanted to know.) and then tell her how they were going to get married.

I didn't tell her during the time but he actually left my state the day after the concert, so there was no physical way he could have done all of these things she was saying he was doing. But I let her talk, I didn't want to tell her that he was gone because I was scared of what she was going to do. Actually during that time, I was doubting my friendship with her but I continued to stay her friend.

That was until about a week and a half later. I was over her house to spend the night. She was in the bathroom taking a shower and getting ready because we were about to go out for the night. I was in her room sprawled across her bed when I had the sudden urge to look up at the ceiling. I couldn't help but to get a little panicked at the time when I looked up because her entire ceiling was covered in hundreds of pictures of the singer. I really didn't want to be at her house any more so I repacked my bags quietly so she wouldn't hear me, but unfortunately she got out of the shower before I could leave. She came into her bedroom to come across me holding my bags. Her eyes kind of widened in disbelief at me. What was the weirdest thing was that she had the hair she pulled out of the singers head attached to her own hair by a hair tie.

At that point I felt like I needed to get out of the house. Me and her were home alone. I was terrified  She was bigger then me and stronger so I had a difficult time getting her off. She lunged at me and wrapped her hands around my throat.

While she was on me she was screaming at me, saying things like I can't take him away from her, that he was hers and that if I didn't take her to see him again she was going to kill me.

I honestly don't really know how I got out of the situation but I do remember immediately telling my parents about the incident and then not soon after the police getting involved. My friendship with her after that went down the drain. I switched phone numbers and about six months later switched schools because I moved.

I don't know what happened to her to be honest. If she got arrested, or sent to a mental institute or what. I sincerely don't want to know. But I do feel like there was something wrong with her and that she needed help.

If anyone has any questions about anything involving the story please feel free to ask. I do want to say I don't feel comfortable telling you the name of the band or the singer that was involved since I don't think it's right for me to do."	t5_2t3t8	True
1364869265.0	1bhkdg	attempted kidnap at zoo	bioticprincess	206	50	16	"Hey nerds. I've been lurking for...fucking ever, and just recently got around to making an account. This is my first submission, so don't bite too hard, k?

I was really curious about any creepy encounter I might have had when I was little, thanks to all the stories here. I asked my mom, and she said ""Fuck yeah. You were an adorable kid."" She started explaining this one situation when I was five or six that happened at a local city's zoo (I live in a small township in Ohio). As she's telling me her memory of this, my own suddenly hits me like a sack of dicks and I have a panic attack because it was so vivid and I'd never remembered it before then. Blocked it, I guess.

I have a pretty good memory, but my mom is also helping me fill in any blanks.

Anyway, we were at the zoo around the big cat exhibits. I was in love with cheetahs at the time, and one of the exhibits had two or three ocelets that liked going near the fencing around their enclosure. There was a tall wooden fence about my height and then heavy duty wire around the enclosure, but there were holes big enough I could surprisingly stick my chubby kid hand in. I remember thinking that the ocelots were just baby cheetahs and trying to pet one of them. 

We started walking around the rest of the zoo, got cotton candy stuck in my hair, almost pissed myself when we went into the aquarium because I was terrified of sharks, etc. Basically, we were having an awesome time and kid me was excited about all the animals around. That is, until my mom says she noticed a woman watching us intently. We wound up heading back to the big cat area because I would not stop blabbering about the ocelots. 

Mom says she got slightly nervous while we were walking back because she thought that the woman had been following us around. Mom has had a stress related mental illness, and I guess she got a little paranoid. Good thing, though:

This woman comes up to me as I'm watching the ocelots, and I remember thinking she looked like a movie star because she had blonde hair and bright red lipstick. She says something like ""Come with me, honey. Come with me: we'll go look for a zookeeper and see about you getting to pet those kitties."" So, I nearly shat my pants at the opportunity, I ignore my stranger danger lessons and take her hand. As I'm walking I remember getting this feeling that I'm going to disappoint the hell out of my mom because I know going off with a stranger is bad, but *ocelots*, man. 

 I'm just beginning to be led away when I hear my mother shout. 

I turn around. It's kinda hazy, but I remember seeing my intimidating, frizzy red-haired giant Amazon of a mother barreling towards me and the blonde through the crowd. Mom scoops me up, I wave bye to the woman as she stumbles away looking pissed off, and that's where the memory fades out. Mom says she had to physically wrench me from the woman because she kept yelling ""This lady is trying to take my baby!"". I started crying when the woman tried to lead me away again, and apparently shouted that she wasn't my mother. 

I just felt so emotional afterward our conversation and thanking her profusely like an ass, because I realized what a close call it had been, lmfao. 

Mama bear don't mess.

1356576822.0	15hywr	Creepy guys at the door	firebirdx	190	36	8	"Info, I'm a 21 year old woman from the UK.
Last year I lived in a two bedroom apartment with a female friend, and at the time this took place, she had gone to stay with her parents for a few days, as someone in her hometown was getting married and she was a bridesmaid.

Since I was in the middle of a huge city, where there was quite a lot of criminal activity, I was a bit freaked out at being home on my own for the first time, but I watched a film then went to bed.

At about 3am, I woke up to a really loud ""BANG BANG BANG"" on the front door. My room is very close to the door, so absolutely terrified, I quickly put some clothes on, left the lights off, and crept towards the door.

Again, I heard the ""BANG BANG BANG"", then a deep voice say, ""Get the fuck out here"". At this point I'm pretty much in tears, wondering who the hell is outside my door. I look through my peep-hole and I kid you not, there were about 7 huge guys standing by the door. Again, someone hammers on the door, and the door is shaking with the force.

So I press the security key for my building, praying that no one will hear, but of course, no one answered it, because the security in my building was terrible. In all probability, I should have called the police, but for some reason I didn't, I called my boyfriend instead and tearfully told him I didn't know what to do. He instantly rounded up some of his friends and high tailed it across to my apartment, however by the time he got there, the guys were gone.

I have no idea when they left, because I didn't dare look through the peep-hole again. We waited around a bit for a security guard, and when one did show up, he walked around the building with us for a while, and told me that none of the security cameras actually work, they're just there as a deterrent.

Nice. 

Glad I don't live there anymore."	t5_2t3t8	True
1356391073.0	15e9d6	Stranger in the Bathroom	personalczech	198	44	27	"When I was a sophomore in college, I had an evening ASL class on the second floor of a building. During that time, the first floor of the building (which had mainly offices for professors) was usually pretty deserted.

One day, before class, I decided to use the restroom on the first floor. As in most restrooms, the handicapped stall was at the very end, and I went into the stall right next to it. I entered the stall quickly and without inspecting it and immediately hung my purse on the hook. As I turned around, I noticed that there was a gigantic pair of men's sneakers poking under the right wall of the stall. From the way they were positioned, a person would have had to have been standing on the other side of the wall (in the handicapped stall) facing my stall. I freaked the fuck out. It was completely silent in the bathroom, and I was scared that if I acted alarmed that it would provoke the person into action (the entire time I'd been in the bathroom, the person hadn't spoken or moved at all). I hastily grabbed my things and went to leave. It was one of the bathrooms with a little vestibule-type thing before the entrance to the restroom, so you had to go through two doors to get inside the actual bathroom. As I was going out the first door, I heard a loud clang and turned in time to see that the door of the handicapped stall had swung open, but nobody had come out of it (I'm assuming that the person kicked the door?). I got out of that bitch and ran upstairs to class.

Pretty anti-climactic, but it is hands down one of the creepier things that has happened to me. I shudder to think of what a man would be doing in a women's restroom, and I am completely bewildered by the fact that he was just standing against a wall. It was almost like he was trying to hide and didn't realize that I could see his feet. In any case... nope. I had class immediately afterward, but I texted my mom and told her what happened, and she called the campus police for me. Never used that restroom again.

Edited: spelling."	t5_2t3t8	True
1349327949.0	10x7bh	The fugitive in the hot tub	kelachris	185	31	20	"This happened to my friend last night. She lives in a wooded area and at night the local roads are pitch black. Like turn-on-your-brights pitch black. She also has a roommate who last night, just her luck, was at a concert a few hours away.

So she goes to bed. An hour or two later she wakes abruptly. A man is yelling outside her window and a dog is barking wildly. She doesn't have a dog. She's instantly awake. She grabs her phone and reaches for her gun. She has walked through this sort of scenario in her head a hundred times before but of course nothing could have prepared her for the real event. She's terrified and shaking so violently she can barely control it, like a seizure.

She calls 911. No sooner did she tell the operator her address when the voice on the other end says that the situation has been taken care of. The police are already there. By the time she hangs up there are six cop cars lining her street in front of her house, lights blazing. The dog was with the police - a German shepherd.

At 6:20 this morning a police officer stopped by her house to fill her in on what happened. There was a high-speed chase and a crash. A dude rolled his truck and ran from the accident. The police used dogs to track him to her property. The guy walked all around her outer fence. They found him IN HER HOT TUB. He was hiding in it with the cover on. Apparently he ducked under the water to ""hide"" from the police.

Here's a link to the news video covering what happened: http://www.wwmt.com/shared/newsroom/top-stories/stories/wwmt_high-speed-chase-ends-man-hot-tub-4718.shtml

1346613787.0	z8q1w	"The Sketchiest ""Smile"""	binnska	189	34	13	"I was angry. Plans for a huge trip I had been planning for weeks fell through at the very last minute. No, that's not true. They fell through a couple of weeks before the very last minute, but no one bothered to tell me. 

I needed to blow off some steam, so I yelled to my then boyfriend that I was going to walk to the gas station on the end of my block. I threw on some flip-flops, grabbed my phone, keys and wallet and stormed out of the house. 

The walk actually did wonders and by the time I was on my way back, I was calm and happily chugging the delicious root beer they carry. I was still angry, but had it under control enough to calmly discuss with my friend when I got home. 

Just before the entrance to my street, I came across a man bending over and clutching his chest. He was winded and sweaty, and wearing a green hoodie. I slowed to ask him if he was all right, but my hand immediately closed on my cell phone in my pocket; something didn't feel right. Even so, he could have been hurt or injured and I was raised better than to let someone die or suffer when I could possibly help.

He stood up to his full height (about 5'6 - about 2 inches taller than me) and smiled this really sketchy smile. He said he was okay, and had just felt a little sick. He started walking, and I stayed back a bit to put some distance between us - his smile had really unnerved me. 

It was was like a chimpanzee baring its teeth. His lips were pulled back over his teeth, and the ""smile"" didn't reach his eyes.

He walked quite a ways before I started walking again, and when I did, he stopped dead to let me catch up. I stopped again and waited for a minute hoping he'd keep going. He didn't, and in fact turned around and started back toward me, that smile plastered on his face. 

In half a second I had my phone in my hand and hit the speed dial button for my boyfriend. He picked up almost instantly and I loudly told him I was just outside and I wanted him to come out so I could show him something. 

The guy stopped in his tracks, pulled his hood up over his head and BOLTED off in the opposite direction. I ran the rest of the distance home and my boyfriend met me at the door. 

I don't know what would have happened if I hadn't called my boyfriend, but I sort of doubt it would have been any flavor of good.

My bed was in the basement right under the front door so I always heard him leave. Well, I heard my dad go this one morning, and fell back asleep. What I thought to be a few minutes later (was really an hour or so) I woke up to this pounding on my bedroom window. My sister woke up (we shared a room) and said ""Go let dad in! He forgot his keys!"" and I thought this same thing, so I ran upstairs, flung open the front door. At this point I realize that since its light outside it must be later than I thought. And no one is at the front door. No one in the cul-de-sac. So I run around the house to the side and out to a slightly larger street. no one. I walk back, again, looking behind all the cars and no one. I go back inside, go get ready for school, etc. I told my mom when she woke up, right before I went to school, and she got all pale saying a girl had been raped the night before, and one a few days before that, all in our two block radius. A few nights later my sister looked out our window again and saw someone hoofing it over the neighbors fence, dressed rather stealthily. They never caught the guy, but the police were on my neighborhood hourly for the next few months (I live in a small city where there is actually the man-force for that, thankfully.)

1374625587.0	1ix7xv	The man in the sinking house	Redchilli007	178	25	32	"I'm about 16 yrs old and still in school and living at home with my parents.  I live in Ireland and its winter so it gets dark early.  At night me and my friends would amuse ourselves by running through the gardens of houses in our estate.  Its a pretty big estate with many houses so there is plenty of ground to cover.  We are not vandals or out to scare people.  Its all about the stealth of getting through it unseen but if the odd chase from a disgruntled home owner occurs so be it.

Our housing estate is on a hill and as we come to the peak of the hill we notice a house with all the lights off.  It looks like some of the curtains have been removed so we guess that a family has moved out and the house is for sale.  We used to play football during the day with the English kid who lived there, he was cool.

Soon after we learn one side of the house was sinking and the renting family was put up in another home.  Soon builders start working on the side of the house that is sinking.  They drill and add supports but they are losing this battle and the house remains abandoned.  We naturally use the house for fun, we hang out their at night, smoking and drinking and telling ghost stories. There is still some furniture left behind such as a kitchen table and chairs and bed frames.  We usually let our selves in through a second story bathroom window and we have to go through a couple of the surrounding houses rear gardens to get to the rear window because the street lights will alert people if we enter through the front of the property.  Its risky but reliable as the local council have the house locked up.

One night we notice a light in the house before we planned to enter.  It looks more like candle light rather than that from a bulb.  We don't enter through the window but walk to the front of the property and notice a beat up car in the driveway.  We figure someone has moved in or the council are onto us and have paid some guy to check up on the place but neither story check out.  The house is still sinking and vacant during the day and our buddies father works in the council says nobody has been asked to look after the place.

We get brave again and start entering the house and the odd time we notice the beat up car in the drive and do not enter.  One night we enter through the rear window, its just me and my buddy.  We hang out upstairs and shoot the breeze.  We get bored and hungry after a while and decide to go to the local chipper for some grub.  We exit through the rear upstairs bathroom window and onto the first floor roof, we jump onto the shed and then into the garden and make our way to the chipper.  We purchase food and drink and consume them on the short walk back to our estate.  We enter the house through the rear garden and second floor window and return to the large upstairs bedroom we were shooting the breeze in earlier.  There are some chairs and stuff we can chill on.

As I sit down I look up at my friend and he is stood in the middle off the room completely frozen with a look of fear on his eyes.  I can tell by the look of fear on his face he is not dicking around and then it hits me.  All of the furniture in the room is arranged differently then it was earlier.  I mouth the words ""Fuck"" silently to my friend.  He remains frozen.  I silently edge towards the window and look out onto the front drive way.  The beat up car is there.  That man is in the house with is.

We stay very quite, fear is roaring through my veins, the house is dark and silent but there is a third person here with us.  I look to my friend and direct my head and the wardrobe.  I am giving him a signal to hide.  He edges silently towards the wardrobe and gets in.  I slide under the bed.  My pulse rate is jacked and I listen carefully for any noise in the house.  I hear nothing.  I whisper to my friend ""Lets get the hell out of here"".  My friend replies ""Ok"" and right then it happens.  Just as he finished talking we hear loud noise, someone opens a door downstairs and starts running through the house fast and loud.  This person is now running up the stairs.  

He is making weird grunting noises like he is angry and in pain from his movements.  He explodes into the rooms upstairs.  Grunting, incoherently shouting a loud mix of mumbled broken English and swear words.  He is angry and violent.  Furniture is picked up and thrown.  Then he stops and quietly returns downstairs.  He is panting.  He is out of breath from his actions and from what I can tell utterly insane.

I am still under the bed.  Frozen and scared.  Trying to make sense of this all.  A nuclear war of panic is raging in my head.  I am utterly terrified and wishing I was at home but too scared too move.  All I can think about is why didn't I listen to my mother and stay out of trouble.  I wish I was at home with her right now.  I will never leave my house again if I make it through this.

More time passes cloaked under a shroud of pure terror.  The silence from downstairs is the worst part.  Its like he is waiting for any noise again before he pounces.  Eventually too much time passes and I need to speak to my friend again.  We can't stay here.  I whisper to him ""Are you still with me, what the fuck is this"".  My voice is fragile and trembling from the wave of unforeseen emotions I am going through.  Tonight was supposed to be fun.  How the hell did I end up in this situation.

My friend doesn't reply. I am wondering is he still there or was he grabbed.  Surely not? I would have heard him scream? He dare not speak in fear of angering the wild brute that lurks downstairs, thats it, he is still in the wardrobe and too afraid to speak.  Yes, that must be it, he is stood there in the darkness feeling as shocked and terrified as I am.  Finally he speaks.  ""We. Must. Get. The. Fuck. Out. Of. Here"" A wave of relief hits me upon hearing his voice and for  a fleeting moment I feel less alone but then the fear sets in once again.

""On Three.  We go.  Agreed?"" My friend replies yes.  ""One"".  ""Tw....   and then we here a grunt and a stir of movement from down below.  The I hear the sound of wardrobe doors crash open and running.  That cunt, my friend has bolted without me.  I make my move.  I don't so much slide out from under the bed but throw it off of me and start running.  The man downstairs has also started to run.  He is grunting and running and opening doors.  He is running for the stairs. He is coming our way.  The bathroom we use to enter and exit onto the roof is the first doorway at the top of the stairs.  I am running along the upstairs landing, I see my friend ahead of my enter the bathroom.  I can hear the man downstairs grunting and running, he is close to the bottom of the stairs.  All of this is happening in some weird slow motion blur, in a strange way its like I feel high, but high from fear.  I just pray that my friend gets through that window and onto the roof quickly so I can make my escape.

I am about to reach the doorway entrance to the bathroom, its right on top of the stairs.  I can hear the grunting and running of the beast.  He is already on the stairs and coming right for me.  Its going to be close.

As I pass the top of the stairs and enter the bathroom I glance down the stairs briefly.  Its dark, all I can see is his silhouette, he is huge, arms are flailing everywhere, he is wearing a long trench coat, I smell mould, he is out of control, angry, grunting and running right at me.  I enter the bathroom and make it to the window.  My friend is in the window frame, he has not made it out yet.  ""Fucking move"" I scream.  I hear the beast, he is at the top of the stairs, he has one hand on the bathroom door frame to help him round the corner.  I have moments left.  My friend is out but in his rush he lets the window swing back at me.   In my panic I put all my weight on it as I scramble out, the window comes of its hinges and I fall out onto the first floor roof holding the window.  I hear grunting very close to me.  I fell the breeze of air from a hand trying to grab at me, coming very close but failing.  I drop the window and jump to the garden.  We make our escape through the gardens and back to my friends house.  We sit in his room catching our breath and just looking at each other.

We never return to the house and either does the beat up car. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1372044253.0	1gy3c0	Taxis aren't always your safest option to get home	stef-witt	182	27	22	"Me and my sisters (of which I have 3) grew up in a small-ish country town in rural Australia. As you could probably imagine, there was not a lot going on there and one by one, we jumped ship and moved to greener pastures... in this instance, bigger more exciting cities. This story is not mine; it is my youngest sister's.

When it came time for her to follow suit and move out, she followed the rest of us to Sydney. At the time this story takes place, she was 19 years old.

At her first work Christmas party, not long after she'd arrived in town, she got slightly intoxicated and not knowing the city very well opted to pay for a taxi in order to get home safely. She left the party, flagged one down, jumped in the front seat next to the driver, advised her destination and began making polite conversation.

As she tells it, the driver was fine at first but before too long he began turning the conversation to her looks and her job, telling her that she was gorgeous and asking if she did any modelling. She laughed it off and told him no. It was at this point that (while driving the taxi) he reached underneath her seat, pulled out a camera and started taking her photo. His compliments grew increasingly cruder and she asked him repeatedly to stop taking her picture before getting angry and yelling at him to stop the taxi and let her out - which he would not do.

Thinking quickly, she looked ahead to see if there were any red lights coming up where he would have to stop the car. Luckily there was one fast approaching. The driver slowed down gradually rather than driving to the lights and stopping, all the while continuing to take her photo. When he was finally moving slow enough that she felt she could exit the car without injuring herself, she opened the door and jumped out. He was moving slowly enough at this point that thankfully she was not injured.

Drunk, scared and lost, she sat in the gutter briefly to collect herself before finally coming to the realisation that (as she had no clue where she was) she would have to get in ANOTHER taxi in order to get home. Reluctantly, she flagged down another car this time getting in the back seat and once again advising her destination. The driver of the second car saw that she had been crying and was visibly shaken up and asked her what had happened and if she was alright. She explained the events.

The second driver paused for a moment before informing her that the first driver had been taking her in the complete opposite direction of where she had told him she needed to go.

Attempts were made to find out who this guy was and report him, however as my sister was drunk and new to the city she was not able to provide enough specific information (i.e. location, exact time, Taxi Company, description of driver etc.). 

Since this incident, whenever she has no other option but to get a taxi home, the first thing she does after getting in the car is take a photo of the drivers licence with her phone. It makes my skin crawl to think that the guy who did this is more than likely still driving taxis in Sydney... and that this is heralded as being the safest way to get home if you're a young woman and it's late at night."	t5_2t3t8	True

My two brothers (8yo and 14yo) and I lived with my parents in China for a while. My mum was studying at a university there and we lived on the campus. It was really safe there, there were guards at each entrance and most of the people who lived in our buildings and the other ones around it were other foreigners or older folk. Our parents had no problem with us wandering around the campus as we liked. One day we had taken a soccer ball to a little courtyard near our building. There was another line of buildings separating ours from the edge of the campus where there was a large wall. The courtyard was right next to the wall.
                               
We were playing a game, I can't really remember what it was, but someone kicked the ball over the wall. My brothers ganged up on me and sent me to get it. It was about a hundred metres down to the gate leading out of the university, so they stayed in the courtyard while I went to find the ball. At the gate there was a security guard who my mum was friendly with, so I said hello to him and he asked where my parents were. My Chinese wasn't too good, but I managed to tell him that they were at home. He looked a bit concerned, but I just said goodbye and went around the wall. The street on the other side was really busy and I thought I'd have a hard time finding the ball. I walked about a hundred metres down the road and looked around, but couldn't see any sign of it. 
                                       
I started walking back and was about ten metres from the gate when I heard someone call out ""Hello!"". In China we'd have people say that to us a lot, so I turned to call back a greeting when I saw a guy sitting on a motorbike holding my ball. He held it out to me and asked if it was mine. I said yes and stepped forward, holding my hands out. Now, as I said, my Chinese wasn't too good, but I could understand fairly well. He held the ball under one arm and motioned for me to get on his bike, saying something like ""Hop on, you can have your ball"". At first I didn't understand what he meant, so I moved closer to him, reaching for the ball. He held it away from me and said more angrily ""Get on and then you can have the ball"". 
                                         
I was getting freaked out at this point. The street had emptied out a lot, as it does once the work day finishes, so there was only a couple of older ladies around. Now, I was a pretty smart kid, smart enough to know that a ball isn't worth getting on a motorbike with a strange man in a strange city, but unfortunately I was also terrified. The guy was getting pretty insistent that I get on the bike and he actually got off the bike and started moving towards me. Luckily the guard my family knew had been keeping his eye on me and came running when he saw this. He told the guy to leave and took me back to the gate. The second I was inside the campus gate I said thank you and took off. I got an earful for losing the ball, but I knew it could've been a lot worse. To this day I am thankful to that guard for keeping an eye on me and stepping in."	t5_2t3t8	True
1370565161.0	1ftwbq	My mom lucked out	alextr0n	181	28	40	"I've been lurking this subreddit for a while and it inspired me to ask my mom if anything like this has happened to her and she told me she had one particular experience that changed her.

About 30 years ago my mom was driving home. She notices a car next to her trying to get her attention. She rolls her window down and the guy in the car asks her to pull over. She does. He pulls up next to her and asks her if she knows how to get to a certain road. My mom tells him she does and says to follow her and she'll lead him to it. He protests and says ""you can just get in my car and show me and then I'll bring you back."" My mom may have been the dumbest person on earth because she says ""okay"", grabs my baby brother, and gets in the man's car. She starts giving him the directions but he completely disregards them and drives into an empty field where NO ONE else is. He stops the car, puts it in park, and turns to my mom. ""You know I can kill you right now, right?"" He tells her. My mom said at this point she had finally realized how stupid she had been. ""Don't EVER get into a stranger's car."" He says and then drives her back to her car. 

I'm not sure if this man was someone who just wanted to teach a young naive woman a lesson or maybe he was actually a murderer/rapist but seeing my younger brother with my mom made him change his mine. I don't know but my mom definitely didnt trust people for a while after that."	t5_2t3t8	True
1360062379.0	17xej0	Smart Girls Know When To Hide.	milkydesu	183	28	67	"Before you wonder, let’s just get this out of the way.  I’m a 19 year old girl, living in the Midwest. 

Right now, it’s really cold and gets dark out rather quickly.  Often, I like to hang out with my friends, but I don’t like to drive, for many reasons, so I like to and prefer to walk places, just as long as the distance isn’t too bad. So, unless I arrange for a ride, I just walk my way there.  I’m not afraid to walk places, at least, I wasn’t. 

 Of course, I’ve heard stories of girls getting stalked, assaulted, kidnapped, you know, all that stuff. It’s never quite bothered me before, I carry a knife in my bag , so I feel rather safe most of the time, not that I’m 100% confident with my knifing abilities, but still, it’s the idea. Plus, I like to think that my city isn’t too dangerous.

  But, you never quite know who is really out there.  

Anyways, I was at my friend’s house, and I was getting ready to walk home. As I was putting on my shoes, his roommate asked me if I wanted a ride home. ( My friend’s car was in the shop, otherwise he would have brought me home. ) I declined, because I would feel bad making someone else stop to help me, even if they did offer.

 It wasn’t a long walk either, maybe about 20 minutes. But I considered. It was winter, and freezing outside, and I was in a dress because I hate to wear pants. Yes, I get a lot of shit for not wearing pants, but after a bit, you get used to your legs being cold, so I didn’t mind. 

 I started my walk, in the dark, looking up at the stars as I put in my headphones. I was walking out of the parking lot of the apartment complex when I was making my way through calve deep snow since there was no sidewalk. Just street and snow. 

 A car was coming down the street in the opposite direction of me, so the headlight temporarily blinded me, but I kept going.  Until I noticed that the white vehicle came to a deep stop.

  I was a good 3 yards away from him, but noticing that the car had stopped, I pulled out my headphones.  I couldn’t see what the mans face looked like, but he had a heavy build, and the window rolled down.  

 “Hey.” He greeted, in more of a command, with a thick Russian accent.  

 “You want a ride?”   I shook my head, and replied with a no, about to just keep going when he stopped me again.  

“No, you come here. I take you wherever you want to go, okay?”  He was silent, then spoke again.  

 “Hey, just come here. Come to the car, and we can make  deal. Don’t be afraid of me,  I promise I won’t hurt you.”  My head screamed at me to keep going. 

 “No, thank you, it’s really not a problem. Have a good night.”




 He rolled up the window, and I felt a bit of relief. Thank god, he’s going to give up and leave.  But my heart stopped when he opened his car door. 




  “Girl. Come to the car.” His voice sounded harsh, like he was getting frustrated.  “Look, I just need favor okay? Just come here, we can make deal.”  




 I watched him quietly, as he turned away and began to dig through the center console after I refused to say anything, purely out of cowardice. It was like all of my rational thinking had stopped and my body and brain were disconnected. 




“Just come to car.” He unbuckled his seatbelt, and as soon as his feet hit the ground, I broke into a run. 
I couldn’t make it all the way home, so my best idea was to run back into my friend’s apartment. 




 I heard him swear loudly, and then a slamming car door. I looked back, and was even more desperate once I saw the vehicle turn into the complex. 

 I can’t explain the thoughts I had been thinking, running as best I could through snow and between cars, but it was something amongst the line of:


“SHITSHITSHITRUNFUCKSHITKNIFEKNIFEGETTODOORCARCARSHITRUN.”




 I ran all the way through the apartment hallways and nearly collapsed once I got into my friends apartment, slamming the door and locking it, standing in front of the keyhole, waiting, as I’m desperately shaking and trying not to lose the rest of what composure I had left. 




 My friends laughed it off, saying I was too paranoid and that the guy was probably just trying to be nice to a girl in a skirt, walking home in winter. 




 Realizing that they, being enlisted in the military, probably didn’t think much of a girl freaking out about some guy stopping to ask her if she needed help, I dropped the subject and tried to not think about it as I gladly accepted blue’s roommates offer to drive me home.  





 The entire way home, I kept my eyes on the lookout for the car, making sure it wasn’t following us or anything.  I got home safely, locked everything, and went to bed. 





 The next morning, I was coming out of my house to help my sister carry in stuff from her car. Getting the last of the stuff, I was shutting the trunk when a loud, startling honk from behind me made me whip around with a disgusted expression on my face, ready to yell at my sister’s boyfriend or one of my neighbors for being a jerk and scaring me.



 But it wasn’t my sister’s boyfriend, or one of my neighbors. 
The white car, headlights glazing, motor running, was in front of me.  




 Arms full with grocery bags, I stood there, dumbstruck and petrified. What the fuck would I do now? The only substantial weapon I had was a block of velveeta cheese, which horribly failed in comparison to, well,  everything. 




 He pulled out away from  the curb, and stopped the car beside me, to which I stepped backwards. The window rolled down in a few mere seconds, but it felt like hours.  I swallowed the lump in my throat.  




 His face was covered with a red ski mask, with dark sunglasses on.  What he said to me is still with me, and since I haven’t walked alone.

1350157183.0	11fd9j	I'm not sure if it counts as kidnapping or sexual assault	reppirts10	200	47	49	"I'm a stripper. I'm from a nice club where no one I know does ""extras"". I do not do extras, I don't even let the men touch me. I'm a very prude stripper and person, and this is important. This all happened to me thursday night.

I made a friend at the club whose stripper name was Caitlyn. She was my first work friend when I moved there. She texts me one day saying she has a bachelor party and sends me a picture with stacks of money. I shit you not there is over $100,000 of stacked money just in that picture. I, of course, accept.

She picks me up in a tinted out escalade, and introduces me to her friend Adrian. He says I'm in safe hands and he'll take care of me. Okay... 

The ""party"" ends up being cancelled and I spend about 3 hours running errands with these two. Then Caitlyn says she needs to stop by our club to meet with a 'client'. I end up alone in the car with Adrian. He takes me to where he's from. The ghetto. I've never been there before and as a white girl from suburbia I don't know how to act. I literally can not understand the ebonics, I am not exaggerating. I knew they were talking about me because I heard my name and could not understand for a second.

We leave one 'trap' house, as they called it, and Adrian brings his friend in the car and we're going down to 7/11 to get a blunt wrap and some weed. I don't smoke and hate driving with that shit in the car I'm in. We get pulled over on the way and these guys are talking SO MUCH SHIT to the police. Since we're in the ghetto the cops ""look past"" their warrants (for drug running and prostitution!!!!!) and just want to search the car. Thank god nothing was in it. 

They let us go and I ask to be taken home, which is about 40 minutes from where we are. This is at 12:30. Adrian says okay, he just has to drop his friend off. We drop his friend off then we go pick up his cousin. His cousin gets in the front seat and adrian gets in the back seat with me to ""support me"". Adrian goes ""Thank god you didn't run your fucking mouth to the cops, I can't have scared girls like you runnin around with me incase we get in a jam.""

WHAT?? I have a permit to strip, bachelor parties are not illegal and I was planning on doing nothing illegal, not even drink. At this point I realize that adrian is a pimp and wants me to be his hoe. Awesome. Get me the fuck out of here. My phone is dying and he lets me use the car charger, but he's holding on to it because he thinks I'll text people where he's at and have them jump him. I'm new to the area and have NO IDEA where I am. Now I feel trapped.

We run errands all over the ghetto for 3 hours. The whole time adrian and I are in the backseat and his hands are rubbing my leg up and down or he's copping a feel of my boobs. I keep trying to swat him off but he holds my arms down sometimes and it hurts. At 3:30 I start holding my ground. ""I've been asking to go home for THREE HOURS. TAKE ME HOME NOW"". He starts calling me a bitch and saying caitlyn never told him I was such a bitch and if he knew he never would have picked me up in the first place. He's now so high he doesn't want to drive me home and is going to have caitlyn do it, even though for the past three hours he said he'd take me home right after these next errands. 

We go back to where caitlyn and him ""stay"". It's in a nice neighborhood but I notice there are no clothes in the closests, just a nice house with beds and couches. Looks like a party house with huge speakers and tvs and nice cars in the driveway. I try and use my phone but it was not charging at all, it is still dead. I don't know where I am and I can't exactly walk the streets at 4 am. So I decide to sit down. 

Adrian takes a shower and comes out with only his towel on. He sits next to me and is really fucking demanding. ""Put your arm around me. CHILL THE FUCK OUT ALLISON."" I get scared and just do what he says. He says ""would you feel more comfortable if I bring one of my guns out here??"" No I would not . I do not want those around me. 

He keeps trying to mount me and touch my vagina. When I get up to sit somewhere else he smacks my ass then moves to where I am. At one point he picks me up and throws me onto the gigantic bean bag chair then takes his hand and holds both mine above my head and starts kissing my neck. His towel is falling off and he's naked on top of me and I'm in a skirt and I'm FREAKING OUT and writhing telling him to get off me PLEASE I just want to go home.

Caitlyn says she's on her way but never shows up. After another couple hours of trying to dodge him from touching me, he gets REALLY MAD and starts slamming every door in the house telling me to ""act right, or else"". He heads to bed and falls asleep. I fall asleep in the beanbag chair by the front door waiting for caitlyn to come so she can please take me home. I find a phone charger and plug my phone in and text my roommate, I'm too scared to call incase it wakes adrian up. She doesn't answer but it's 6 am now so I fall asleep and wake up at 8 and ask adrian to take me home. He says I can take his car but I have to come back the next night to make it up to him. I say ok, and was just going to leave the car on a street and have it get stolen. He says I have to ""bob on his dick"" to get privileges like that. I say I'm just going to get my stuff.

I get my bag and RUN out of that house now that it's daylight. My phone is only charged one bar and I'm confused, I think adrian turned the power off last night. 

I call my roommate to send me a taxi number and wait 45 minutes on a random persons front steps waiting for the taxi to come. I see adrian driving around the neighborhood but I'm behind plants and a pillar on this front step and he can't see me. Caitlyn and him are calling me off the hook. 

Since then, Adrian has called or texted me like 50 times. I felt like it was my fault for getting in this situation since I am a stripper. I've only been dancing for a few months and am still pretty ashamed about it.  I'm not going to go to the police because he would be in jail for life and it's not like he raped me, plus I don't want to get caitlyn in trouble for prostiution or something.

Sorry it was such a LONG story, it just happened to me and I'm still freaked out.



TL;DR: Get tricked into doing a bachelor party which really meant get introduced to a pimp and trapped with him for hours trying to touch me.



EDIT: To everyone saying I should call the police: no. When we were in the ghetto he said he ""had my back."" That he had my back in a way that if anyone messed with me he could ""have anybody killed. Anybody. I don't have to pull any trigger because there are so many out of work cousins in this neighborhood that would do anything to feed their family"". He's been locked for murder before. I will not mess with this guy. You guys do not understand and that's okay. I just won't do it."	t5_2t3t8	True
1348607519.0	10gysq	Giiiiiirls	haleyhaleyraerae	184	34	47	"A few years back I went to go meet my sister at a mutual friend's apartment after I got off work. It was winter time and like most of Canada-land, we get VERY cold and snowy winters. So here's the setting, me on my way through the icy snow to meet up with a group of friends.

Now that that's out of the way...

So I get to our friend's apartment and everything is going as fabulous as a Friday night after work could go. Mastadon blaring, good friends, and a few joints being passed around. Everyone was pretty drunk by the time I got there and since I was driving, I only had a beer or two.

Around 2 am my sister and I decided to head back home since we were both living at our parents at the time. Now I should mention that our friend's apartment at the time was not necessarily in the nicest part of town. Many of what we like to call ""Winnipeg's finest"" get knifed around there so it wasn't the most ideal place to be leaving at 2 in the morning. But whatever, we had to get home right?

So my sister, being the genius that she is, had worn heels that night. In about 4 feet of snow...yah, super smart. We had to walk through a back alley to get to where I had parked and as I had mentioned, everyone but me was pretty tanked by the end of the night, including my sister.

So there we were, walking through this sketchy back alley and she decides to be artistic and start taking pictures with her phone. I had been walking a head of her and was about 10 feet in front when I turned to see what the hell she was doing. My heart nearly sank when I looked back and saw that there was a VERY not so appealing looking man walking not 15 feet behind my sister. I tried not to make it seem like I was frightened because I had no idea what this guy might do so I just yelled to my sister to get a move on and nodded my head in his direction. She turned to see him and it clicked that she really needed to haul ass.

Just as we both started to speed our pace, the random stranger began to meet ours. I could see the car about 20 feet away and knew that if we didn't start running, we would not be able to get into the car in time and he would have caught up to us.

Just as things were getting bad, they got worse and all I could hear from behind us was the most utterly creepy, bone chilling voice call out, ""GIIIIIIIIIRLS"". It almost sounded like it was coming from the very bottom of his gut.

At this point I though, ""fuck this noise"" and just screamed, ""Sister, RUN!""

Now you all have seen at least one girl try to run in heels, it ain't pretty. Add to that the fact that there is at least 4 feet of snow, yah, you can imagine it wasn't easy for her to get her ass over to the car. Thankfully I was an athlete and sprinted my little legs over to the car just in time to get it unlocked, and then lock it right back up again.

It was literally one of those moments where I was fumbling with the keys to get them in the ignition and when I finally got the car started, I looked back and saw the creeper like 5 feet behind our car with a giant block of ice ready to throw at my back window. I nope'd the fuck out of there as hard as my foot could press on the gas peddle just as he launched the ice block.

My drunk ass sister was calm in about 5 minutes...I was about nearly pissing myself.

TL;DR Guy chases myself and drunk sister in an alley and throws ice block at our car. Drunk sister resumes drunk state.

1347032015.0	zid03	The creep at the caravan park	amylondon	184	32	9	"Hi all. This isn't my story, however it's something that happened to my boyfriend’s sister (who's a friend of mine), my boyfriend and his family so I can guarantee its validity. I've heard the story from 3 points of view that all match up, so I can assure you it's the truth.

This happened when my boyfriend, James, was around 12 and his sister, Maggie, was 13 (now aged 23 and 24). They were holidaying with their mum and step dad in a typical British caravan park somewhere in Kent (believe it was a Haven). If you don't know a typical seaside caravan park in the UK, then it's basically a cheap getaway where you stay in a mobile home, and there's usually an onsite facility with things like karaoke, live entertainment, amusement arcades and a pub etc. It's very cheap and cheerful, a bit tacky, and just generally your typical working class holiday.

The family were all at the on the on-site disco one night. The adults were sat at a table and the kids were dancing on the dance floor, probably to the macarena or something else awful. Maggie was dancing away when she noticed a man sat at a table just staring at her. He was on his own, fairly old and looked generally creepy. Maggie has always been tall for her age, but still looked like a young teenager and no older. After being sufficiently creeped out by the man, she went and sat with her mum and step dad. The man continued looking at her but she tried to ignore him and eventually went back to dancing. After a while, she went to the bathroom; shortly after entering the man followed her in. All alone in the bathroom, he pinned her up against the wall and said something along the lines of ""I know you want it"". She managed to get away and ran back to the table with her parents. The song ‘Red Red Wine’ by UB40 was playing at the time, which she still can’t listen to to this day (this is how I first heard of the story, by randomly singing the song). She didn’t tell her parents then and there, but just stayed quiet and seated until the night was over.

They all walked back to their caravan. At this point her mum and step dad had obviously noticed something was wrong and when they were inside she told them what had happened. Now, their mum and step dad aren’t together anymore, but they’re still very close to him and see him as a father due to the absence of their own. I personally know Rob now, and he’s a nice guy, but also the kind of person you wouldn’t want to mess with. One of those people that are very well known around the area. Anyway, Rob suggested that him and Maggie go out for a walk. She really didn’t want to leave as she was still terrified, but he convinced her fresh air would do her good. So off they went. Not a 100m on and Maggie goes all shy and starts hiding slightly behind Rob. It’s the creepy man from earlier walking towards them. Maggie tells Rob it’s the man who attacked her in the bathroom. He immediately runs towards this guy and starts beating the living shit out of him, in all the commotion my 12 year old boyfriend runs out and tries punching the guy as well. All this time the guy keeps shouting “I thought she was 16, I thought she was 16”.

Either due to coincidence or someone in a nearby caravan hearing and seeing the commotion, a police or security van (I’m not sure which) drives past and stops next to them. They initially try and detain Rob as the other guy is completely battered, but after he explains what happened they grab the other guy off the ground and drag him into the van. This is where it gets weird. The guy suddenly panics and starts shouting “I didn’t kill those girls I swear, I promise I never killed them”.  Maggie, Rob and my boyfriend are all a bit confused and weirded out at this point but after talking to the police are allowed to go back to their caravan.

Around two days later they find out in the local paper that two teenage girls bodies had been discovered not far from where they were staying. They were around the same age as Maggie. I think she had quite a lucky escape there.

Sorry, I’m not a natural writer but this story has given me the creeps since they told me. I’ve tried not to include any detail that I haven’t been told directly. If you have any questions feel free to ask, and if I don’t know the answer I can ask Maggie or my boyfriend.

I then recalled an *extremely* vivid memory from when I was about 7 or 8 years old. It kinda disturbed me to realize how sick this memory really was, and I figured /LetsNotMeet would enjoy it. Sorry for it being long! Like I said, very vivid memory.

My grandparents lived in a big neighborhood. It was nice old neighborhood with tall houses and trees everywhere. Everyday after school, that's where I would go because my parents worked non-stop. After eating, I told my grandmother I was going down the street to play with one of my friends. I was never allowed to leave sight of the house but, as I was biking down to meet my friend, I noticed a garage sale on a perpendicular street. There was only one truck parked by the sale, so it wasn't busy, and a friendly looking old man that was running it. I figured it wouldn't hurt to just see if they had toys, so I biked down there.

 Immediately, I bee-lined to look at the toys, because there was A LOT of them. They were antique; beautiful dolls and stuffed animals, toy houses. All of them compelled my interest, but there was a small fluffy teddy bear near the ""cash register"" that I was simply mesmerized by. It was one of those old teddy bears- the ones with mechanisms on the arms and legs that made them move? It also had a distinct floral scent, which I'm pretty sure was roses. As I held the teddy bear, I noticed the old man was gazing at me from a lawn chair next to the cash register. (Which was halfway in the garage.) Not a stare, not lust, but a gaze- almost like he had just seen an angel. He had a smile on his face. Not warm really, not cold though. Like I said, as if he had seen an angel. As I was a sheltered little girl, I didn't really see anything suspicious about this. Just stared and smiled back at him. He grinned again and told me to come sit on his knee, and he'd tell me something. This creeped me out a little bit, I knew what stranger danger was. But I inched closer, because I was a stupid, curious little bastard. He put his hand on my shoulder, gently. He smelled like smoke, and he need a shave. Plus he had these steel grey-eyes that were just.. piercing.. Paired with that smile, the situation was starting to get unnerving. He pulled me in close, on his knee, even though that's not what I had planned.. And said, ""I'll give you that teddy bear free if you give me a hug."" Overjoyed, uneasiness completely disappeared from my mind, and I jumped into his arms. 

He hugged me tight, almost savoring the moment. It seemed so innocent- hugs for teddies. And, I didn't realize the perversion at the time, but he had his hands on my upper legs when the hug was finished. He was holding me there, but stroking with his thumbs at the same time. Then he whispered- ""I'll give you something else you like if you give me some sugar, sweetie.""  I pulled away and very politely told him no, thanked him heartily for the teddy, then skipped back down to my bike. As I turned back to wave at him, he smiled again. This time though.. it wasn't the awe-struck smile as before. It was dark.. full of ill-intent. He blew me a kiss. That grin on his face finally made me realize for the first time- okay, I'm *very fucking scared* now. I rode back home, told my grandmother about the really creepy guy, and he gave me this cool bear! She was terrified, and called the cops. I never knew what happened to the old man, but what I did gather from the predicament- he didn't actually live there. 

Never was bothered by pedo again, that I know of, but it shocked me that I didn't realize how truly scary this was until remembering it. He had me at full vulnerability, and yet he let me walk off!



**TL;DR Went to a garage sale as a kid, possible pedophile traded a teddy for some lovin'. He asked for more, got denied, and for some reason, let me go.**"	t5_2t3t8	True
1329029615.0	plt62	[My] Mom has pretty hair.	Torrenthurder	183	31	23	"In 1977 my Mother graduated High School.  She was from a very small town in Southern Illinois called Crossville.  Being from such a small town, her and her classmates were really close.  They used to drive around all over and stay in abandoned farm houses  or go camping out in the woods, lots of stories there too.  My Mom was joining the Army in September, but before she left, her class mates wanted to hang out a lot.  

One of her friends had family in Missouri, and almost every summer they would go canoeing down the Current River.  Since they were all old enough they decided to make a Senior trip and had been planning it since before they graduated.  It was only going to be a 4 day trip.

On the first day my Mom and 4 friends drove from Crossville to Eminence, Missouri.  On the next day they started canoeing.   They had been canoeing for about 5 hours and were very hot.  They came to a spot where the river was shallow enough you could wade around.  

They saw a little boy who looked about 10 years old walking across the river.  He had long black hair and was only wearing underwear.  He was holding a mason jar, and my Mom and her friends thought he had spring water.  My mom yelled out to the boy,""Hey where did you get that spring water!""  The boy looked up and looked scared.  He ran back into the woods from the side he had came.  All the kids in the canoes were kinda freaked out now.

About a minute later my mom heard this,""Where are you Blondie, what did you say to my boy?""  A woman and a man came out of the woods.  They both had very long black hair, but the woman's was very long.  The man was holding a knife.  The woman saw my Mom and pointed at her.  ""Look at her fucking hair, I'm going to cut it off.  I'm going to cut all your hair off Blondie!""  The man and the woman started wading out into the river at a run and all the kids started paddling for their lives.  As they were paddling away the woman screamed, "" You won't get away you Blonde bitch, this is our woods.""

They got away and paddled for another 4 hours and were very tired.  They had to set up camp cause is was getting so dark.  They all slept that night but my Mom had never been so scared.  They were picked up down river later that day and went home.

They figured those people were moonshiners.  I personally think they were just trying to scare them off from their still, but my mom thinks that woman was going to kill her."	t5_2t3t8	True
1373996118.0	1ifcn6	Update: Our neighbor with the van. [long]	stalkersloveme	179	27	37	"Wow. So it's been a while since I posted last, but things have been escalating, so I thought that this deserved an update. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1ee1s7/our_neighbor_with_the_van/) is a link to my original post. I'm sorry for the length.

**May**

When I last wrote, my landlord had spoken with our neighbor about moving his van. He did move it, about 20 feet further down than he was currently parking... [Here](http://i.imgur.com/G9wR7JP.jpg) is a photo. His previous parking spot was over in the right hand corner of the photo, you can see two lines where his tires had killed the grass. After four days of him refusing to move his car, I called one of our other landlords. This landlord came over and spoke with the guy. Creepy neighbor states that he can't move his car, because the apartment complex lot ""is full."" My landlord walks over to the lot with him, where the lot is about 90% empty. Creepy neighbor moves his car immediately afterwards. 

We're pleased. He still stares at us, creeping us out, but things are quiet for a while. About two weeks after the incidents of the previous post occurred, the contractor for the house stopped by to check up on everything and see if we needed any work done. We told him no, and chatted for a while. He turns to leave, and then he turns back to me. ""Hey, I don't know if you've run into him yet, but you should steer clear of the guy in the white van.""

""What?"" I ask, in disbelief.

""Yeah. A few weeks before you guys moved in, I had my guys here working on a project. I came back from a lunch break and walked in. That guy was just standing in the house. He told me that the workers told him he could come in and check the place out, clearly not knowing that I was the owner of the company. My guys would never do such a thing. I kicked him out immediately and let your landlords know, but there's something wrong with that guy."" The contractor left, shutting the door behind him.

**June**

June passes quietly, and we hear nothing more from creepy neighbor for a while, just the staring.

**July 13, 2013**

On Saturday night, I had a friend visiting that I had studied abroad with last summer. He invited two of his friends over, so there were 7 of us total. We were just hanging out, playing some pong, really nothing rowdy. One of the girls leaves, and the other one goes outside to talk on the phone with her boyfriend briefly. She comes back in after about 20 minutes, telling us that a cop was outside and that she had just been questioned/ID'd for a noise complaint. I go outside, and see the cop pulling out of our driveway. I asked her if she had been issued a citation, but she told me that she hadn't. I'm irritated, because of course we know who has called the cops on us, but let it go, and we continue to hang out.

The next morning, I go outside with my roommates and my visiting friend to pile in the car to get breakfast. About 5 feet from my front door is a pile of cigarette butts, and a little ways up from that is a few smashed beer bottles. Now, no one in my house smokes, and no one in my house would smash beer bottles in an area where we frequently walk barefoot. It looked like someone had been standing outside the house, five feet from my front door, smoking for a long period of time. Then they'd either thrown a beer bottle at the house, or just smashed it there. Either way, I'm really freaking not okay with it, and I go online that night and order a security camera.

**July 15, 2013**

This all brings me to last night. My car has been acting up recently, to the point where I can't turn off my headlights at all. This, of course, caused my car to die last night around 11PM, which is inconvenient since I need it to get to the airport tonight. So I decide to jump it with someone's help, and to drive it across the street and let it die at the mechanic's so they can fix it in the morning. No one in my house knows how to jump a car, so I head over to 7-11 to recruit someone to help. A nice lady who works there and who knows us pretty well by now comes over, and we're fiddling with my car for a while. Turns out my jumper cables were faulty, so we pull another set out and my car gets working! 7-11 lady goes back to 7-11, my friend whose car I'm using leaves, and my female roommate and I hop into my car to drive it across the street. I park it at the mechanic's station, and we walk back across the street. It is at this point that we notice two cop cars, one unmarked, sitting in our driveway.

""Officers, is there a problem?"" I called. They inform us that they have gotten a noise complaint, and we explain the situation. Cop 1, an older guy, goes to 7-11 to ask the lady there to corroborate our story and ask if we were being loud, which we were not. Cop 2, a young, attractive cop, runs our ID's and continues to ask us questions.

I bring up the neighbor. Cop 2 seems exceedingly interested, and we tell him all the backstory on the situation. Cop 1 comes back from 7-11. He seemed to think that we were lying before he went in there, but now he seems concerned. We clue him in on what we're talking about. He asks, ""Is it a heavy-set man, mustache, baseball cap?"" We tell him YES that's him! As this conversation is happening, we see the neighbor slink out of 7-11 and pause, clearly trying to listen to see if we're getting in trouble.

The cops ask us what kind of car the guy drives. I tell him, ""um...a really shitty white van. I'm sorry for the profanity! I just, that's just the best way to describe it. It's parked in the parking lot over there, and you'll know it when you see it, I promise!"" Cop 1 goes to check out the van and run his plates and stuff.

We keep chatting with Cop 2, and he walks us from the end of the gravel lot, near the street, towards our front door. The cop car is still parked at the end of the driveway/parking lot. We ask him about security cameras, where he thinks that we should put them, etc. As we're talking, all of the sudden we all notice something. 

THE NEIGHBOR IS RIGHT THERE. AT THE COP CAR. Peering into the cop car with his hands all over the windows. The cop shines his flashlight on him, and yells, ""HEY! GET AWAY FROM THE CAR! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"" The neighbor straightens up, and runs, pretending like he has no idea who the cop is talking to. I'm freaking out at this point. The neighbor darts back to his apartment building, pretending to go inside. He had just ducked around the corner though. He was listening. We can all see his elbow poking around the corner as he stands there. The cop tells us to stay safe, and that he'll be outside for a long time tonight. We go inside, and lock the doors.

After about 15 minutes, my roommate and I walk to 7-11 together. We can see Cop 2's car across the street, and he waves at us. We wave back. We talk to 7-11 lady, and she tells us what went down. Apparently the cop came in to talk to her, and creepy neighbor comes bursting in screaming. He tells the cop that we party all night, every night, until the wee hours of the morning (false) among other things. He tells the cop that ""he's going to teach us a lesson."" He says that we're ""going to learn some respect"" from him, and other things along this line, which explains why Cop 1 looked much more concerned when he came out of 7-11 than when he went in...

So this morning, we left a message for our landlord. We're going to ask for permission to ban this guy from our property, and if we see him on our security camera, that's an offense. I walked over to the mechanic's at about 8AM this morning to get them to look at my car, and then I walk back. I'm exhausted, I skip class today because I didn't sleep last night. I feel like crap. I get a voicemail from my mechanic telling me the price of the work they're doing ($213) and tell me to call back if I have any questions. Fine by me, I'll just wait for them to call me for pickup.

I started thinking, though. Could...this have been the neighbor? I call the mechanic and ask if there is any indication of possible tampering with my engine. I am told a resounding YES, it is absolutely possible, if not likely.

And that's where I am. I'm sitting in my bed, waiting for the mechanic to call me to pick up my car. I'm going to get more details on what was wrong, and what it looked like inside my car, and then I'm going to call Cop 2 from last night (he gave me his card). I am officially scared, and my camera cannot come fast enough.

1371862044.0	1gtwmz	Costume change: Was I being paranoid?	Nettles4Porcupines	173	24	21	"I was at the Mumbai airport heading back to the US. I was traveling alone. As I walked up to the line to go through immigration,  the man at the end of the line turned very quickly, faced me square on, and said simply, ""Hello."" He was large, balding, and middle aged and I felt immediately unnerved for several reasons: I was already on my guard as I was traveling alone in a foreign country and something about his tone was off. As a young female, I'm used to random men hitting on me, but his tone was almost stern, not at all flirtatious.

I said hi, but in a less than friendly tone and didn't make eye-contact with him. He weirdly started peppering me with direct questions: ""Where are you flying?"" ""What's your name?"" Before I could even answer, I saw he was staring at the passport and boarding pass in my hand and I realized I couldn't lie  (which is usually my first defense when talking to random men) so I answered. 

At this point I started wondering if he worked for immigration, his questions were so similar to the ones they ask. But I noticed that his passport was from the UAE and he was holding a boarding pass too. So I asked him the same questions back. He said he was a businessman from the UAE but living in London. He asked me more direct questions: ""Are you traveling alone?"" No, I lied, my cousin is waiting for me at our gate. ""What airline are you flying?"" American. ""Are you a student?"" No. ""What were you doing in Mumbai?"" Visiting family. Luckily, he was called up to the immigration desk at this point. He was asked and answered questions like any other traveler.

After him, I went up to the immigration official. The man did not proceed to the security line, but waited behind the immigration desk, texting and staring at me.

I wondered if he was trying to hit on me and was just very weird or if something more sinister was going on. What, I couldn't imagine, but I was pretty sure he wasn't some plain-clothes immigration official.

After I finished at immigration I tried to ignore him and quickly walk past him to the security line, but he followed fast behind me. Luckily for me, Indian airports divide security lines by gender because there is often a pat-down at the end for which they use a same-sex security person. The female line was far shorter than the male line so I made it through much ahead of him.

I ran to the nearest bathroom, knowing that he could not find me there. Once inside, I realized that I had almost 2 hours until my flight and I didn't want to sit in the bathroom for that long. So I came up with a plan that in my jet-lagged state seemed to make perfect sense: I would disguise myself so he couldn't find me again. I changed out of the colorful dress I was wearing into a black sweatsuit in my carry-on. I also took out my contacts and put on my glasses. I put my hair in a bun. I had been wearing no makeup previously, so I put a ton on. Then I ventured back out into the terminal. 

I never saw him again. I flew home and nothing bad happened. So, was I being paranoid? Or would other people have been creeped out in this situation? What could he have been up to?

1371060952.0	1g7lnu	Only time I've ever felt endangered	chloeelizabeth91	202	50	58	"Okay to preface this, yes I realize my actions were fucking stupid that night and careless and I have since learned so putting aside those comments going on in your head screaming i'm an idiot here goes. also I am a female for reference

About a year ago I was at my on campus bar with some friends and was good and dickered. A guy came up and started dancing with me which was fine, eventually i got hot and told him I had to go outside. He followed chatting with me, he asked if I wanted to go back to his place to watch a movie and that if I so wished to go home at the end of it he would pay for a cab. Being the dumb, poor, drunk student I am I agreed thinking hey free cab ride worse comes to worse why the fuck not. 

So we go to his place and sure enough he puts on a movie, but within 5 seconds I can tell watching the movie is the farthest thing from his mind. This guy is all over me and I mean persistently so. I was only wearing a dress and he kept asking me if I was uncomfortable and wanted to take it off, I declined as I didn't really want to do anything with this guy. He insisted that I should take it off, and offered a pair of his boxers for me to wear. Again I declined, this time he was rudely insistent, almost to the point of begging. He told me that he really wanted me to wear his boxers, I still said no - not really wanting to be semi naked around this guy. Eventually he gives up and comes over trying to do anything and everything he can - felt like I was being mauled. All the while I'm physically pushing him off of me and telling him no. 

At one point his roomate knocked on his door wanting to go for a smoke, so he left me alone. At this point I'm basically sober, realize how much danger I could potentially be in and I call my best friend, we have this rule called Monkey Slutting where if one of us texts or says it to each other they do what ever needs to be done to get you away from the guy that is bothering you. So I put this in effect, telling her to call me in like 10 minutes complaining that I need to come home. So the guy comes in as she calls back and when I get off my fake phone call with her I tel him I need to go home. This guy won't take no for an answer and is literally blocking the door telling me my friend will be fine. I keep protesting say I have to go and he slowly approaches me, essentially backing me up to the bed. 

Again he pushes me to the bed trying to do all and everything he can, at this point I literally have my knees between me and his chest trying to get him off of me. I'm telling him no, I don't want to do this, to get off me etc. It's at this point that i'm thinking holy shit I'm going to be raped. He's not listening, so finally I say I have to go to the bathroom and then I'll come back. I go to the bathroom and call a cab giving him the guys address and telling him to come ASAP. My full plan is to go sit outside (even though it was blizzarding out) without telling him and wait for the cab. I open the door to see him standing outside of it waiting for me, he claims he was afraid I would get lost in his house. I tell him that I called a cab already and have to get going. 

He resigns himself to the fact that i'm leaving and goes fine we'll go wait for the cab. We get to the front door and I go to wait outside, knowing he probably wouldn't suffer the cold weather to wait with me. He gets up and closes the front door before I can get out of it telling me to wait inside, since it is warmer. I tell him it is no problem, I'm feeling a little hot and the cool air would be nice. To which he forceably tells me NO wait in here. So I go to sit on the couch (he was sitting in a chair) and he goes no come sit on my lap. I swear I will never feel more like a prisoner than that night, the menace in his voice I was afraid to do anything else than what he requested. So I sat on his lap and he creepily stroked my hair and kissed my neck.

The second I saw the cab headlights I was off his lap in a flash and out the door. I jumped in the front seat and just told the cabbie to floor it. I learned an important lesson that night about getting free shit from guys, sometimes they can be pushy and expectant that you'll pay them back in sexual favours. Only time I've ever been truly concerned for my well being.

tl;dr: Wanted a free cab ride home, ended up in a very sketchy situation in which my gut was screaming at me that I was going to be raped. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1364677590.0	1bbl2r	My brothers late night cigarette	Pandabearz9	178	26	18	"This happened about 2 years ago to my brother when he was 18. It was a late summer night around 11:30-1 am. My brother was coming back from dropping his friends off, when he noticed a cop was following him, as usual. We live in a small city in the mountains, so when a cop sees a young male driving late at night he automatically assumes he is up to no good. 

My brother didn't want any trouble, so he decided to pull into a street and act like he lived there, so the cop would stop following. The street my brother pulled into happened to be one he's quite familiar with. He often goes dirt biking with his friends there since there's few people. The street is very large, heavily wooded, and has few houses. This is the street, it's highlighted yellow http://imgur.com/YBg6uHi . 

 So, after my brother pulled onto the street, far from the houses, he pulled over and decided to smoke a cigarette.  Let me start off by saying, my brother is quite large. He's around 6'4 and very muscular, so he isn't exactly the type of guy most people would think of messing with. Anyway, he was standing outside his truck smoking when he felt like someone was watching him. He stood for a moment more and looked around. Nothing that he could see was around, but he had this overwhelming fear to get into his truck and lock the doors. While doing so, a huge rock came flying at him, and a man wearing all black came charging. My brother thankfully was in his truck with the doors locked by the time the guy had reached him. The man then stood in-front of his truck. At that point my brother floored it the fuck out of there. My brother made it home safely that night. From that point on, he has never went on to a very dark street late at night for any reason. "	t5_2t3t8	True

Names changed for obvious reasons.

""Nearly two months ago there was a customer at work - he was probably in his 50s. I noticed he started following me around the store, so I asked if he needed any help and he just started making loads of conversation, so I thought he was being friendly. Then he starts trying to touch me, stroking my arms and hair etc, so I started freaking out. He got really sleezy and creepy, telling me to meet him at the hot pools the next day to have some wine, that I should stay with him at his house, and I should be the ""special guest"" at his place for dinner that night. I looked around for any of the guys I work with or the security guard, but they weren't around. He kept asking things like what my car looked like and where I lived etc.. Anyway eventually he left and I found Jason the security guard. Completely had a break down, had to sit up in his office and re-live it, showing Jason what happened with the security tape footage.
The same guy came in the next week. I had been freaking out all day, being paranoid that I'd see him and it had been ages and he hadn't turned up, so I thought he'd left me alone. Turned around, he's standing right there. I freaked out and tried to run over to Jason but he grabbed my arm and pulled me into him saying I was rude for not accepting his inviatations. The guys got him off me and Jason trespassed him, so he's banned from coming in the store for two years. Jason had to talk to him before he trespassed him though, and the guy knew what car I drove, what school I went to, that I was from England...I was so fucking scared.
But it had been ages since I saw him and I thought he wouldn't be stupid enough to come back. When I finished work and went out to my car, which isn't on work grounds, he was waiting next to it. I just froze. I pretended I hadn't seen him and walked the other way back to the store but he ran after me and got me on the floor..I was screaming so loud that people came out of the shops around us and they got him off me, but he just kept shouting ""you will be my special guest. you will love it. you'll never want to leave."" 
I'm literally too scared to leave my house, but I'm also too scared to stay here, because I don't know if he's figured out where I live. I've got Jason's number on speed-dial and he said to call him if I ever see him, but it doesn't make it any less terrifying.
So I'm sorry for being so snappy, but I'm just fucking petrified at the moment  :'c ""

1352172411.0	12pj0c	Creep got fired for stalking me after my first day at work	TheHoundsOFLove	175	27	8	"This is another one of those stories where, if it had happened any time recently, I would have handled it a lot differently. But of course hindsight is 20/20 and everything turned out okay in the end, so...
(Also sorry, it ended up being longer than I thought)

It was about 10 years ago, when I was 17 and just starting a summer job at the Jersey Shore. On my first day, one of my co-workers (25ish) was hitting on me, but it wasn't anything excessively creepy, just annoying. I just figured I'd have to do my best to avoid/ignore him in the future. Other that that the day goes smoothly and I go home.

Now as a bit of background, our summer house was a split-level, meaning that one family lived on the 1st/ground floor of the house and we lived on the 2nd. It was a normal looking house though, and you wouldn't be able to tell that by looking at it. The only way to get to our part of the house was via steps leading up to the deck outside- our only entrance. For some reason I happened to be staying by myself that night, my other family members were out of town for whatever reason.

So I'm outside on the deck when I see the skeezy coworker pull up outside my house. I have no idea how he found out my address, he never asked me for it and I certainly never gave it to him. I wasn't overly alarmed- this was pre-cell phone days and in a vacation town so it wasn't uncommon for friends/neighbors etc to just stop by with no notice. However I didn't feel like dealing with him, so I go inside before he can see me- not even taking the time to lock the door. Our house also had big picture windows so everything is very visible in the main living area of the house, so i head down the hallway. For some reason I decide to go into the bathroom instead of my bedroom, which ends up being lucky- my bedroom door didn't have a lock, but the bathroom did. 

I'm in the locked bathroom waiting to hear if he's (I'll start calling him Chris, i don't remember his real name anymore) going to knock, but instead I hear him come straight up the deck stairs (he must have seen me? Idk why he wouldn't go to the main front door) and *open the door (which remember I hadnt locked) and come in the house without even knocking*! I could hear him walking around, calling my name out, he even tried the handle on the bathroom- thank god I had locked it. He eventually leaves, but this was only the beginning...

Now at this point of course, i should have called the cops. Someone essentially just broke into my house. But I was young and dumb, and scared of the consequences at work- i didn't want to be ""that girl"" who called the cops on her coworker after her 1st day, when he was just trying to be friendly, or something. Again, if this happened today I wouldn't have let it escalate the way it did, but such is the case with many of these stories...

Now the phone calls start. Again, i didn't give him my number, i'm assuming he got the info from work somehow. I didn't answer the phone, nor did I take it off the hook bc  I thought that might give him a sign that I was home. He called over 30 times that night and left 11 messages, I counted. The messages he left on the machine were so creepy- it would just be silence then him saying my name- 
""....Daisy...Daisy...Are you there?.....Are you there Daisy?...Daisy, are you there?""
 Every time, over and over. (My name isn't actually Daisy...) I saved the messages in case i needed them as proof of anything.

At this point I had locked the door and closed all the blinds (except the front door didn't have one, so I put a towel over it). And the phone calls keep coming, and he comes back to the house 3 more times. I can hear him trying the door downstairs, throwing pebbles at the window, circling the house. Again, should have called the cops, but part of me thought that he was just really socially awkward and didn't realize what he was doing was way over the line. But i didn't want to confront him, regardless of whether his intentions were to rape/murder me.

I did eventually call my mom, and she could hear the fear in my voice, and ended up driving 2 hours to come rescue me. But in the meantime I was still dealing with his phone calls/attempts to get in the house. I was afraid to leave the house and go to a friends bc I thought he would be waiting outside, again only one way in/out of our part of the house.

Eventually I hear more footsteps on the deck (again), and I'm pretty much in tears at this point, I'm so scared. Luckily, it ends up being 2 friends of mine who were just randomly stopping by- I have never been so happy to see them in my life. We quickly go to their car and I end up spending the night at their house.

The next morning my mom and I go to the police station to file a report- I was afraid he was going to come back. What's creepy was that when I told the cops his name, they were all ""Oh yeah, we know that guy..."" I was supposed to go to work that morning, my mom went with me and we told my manager what happened the night before. To his credit he said ""we don't need people like that working here"" and immediately found Chris and fired him. I didn't tell everyone my story but word got around and everyone at work was really supportive.

Luckily nothing further happened after that, but what bothered me about the whole thing was that for a long time it made me afraid to be alone, and I flinched every time the phone rang :( But in a way it's also given me confidence enough to not let myself get in a situation like that again, and also not hesitate to call the cops!"	t5_2t3t8	True
1344667312.0	y1f6s	Have you seen my wife?	Sachstyle	187	33	25	"Working alone is scary. Working alone as an 18 year old girl at a full service gas station in a scummy part of my town on the night shift, by myself is even worse. 


Let me tell you  a little about this station first off. It was one of the first gas stations opened up for a local company, and they were keeping it open for nostalgia's sake. This means that it was all much older equipment, (like no credit card slots at the gas pump, ancient cash register, no cameras etc.) and we were to work in this little glass box of a store, of which we sold no product in. This was solely a place where my job was to go outside and pump people's gas. (And for the year I worked here there, since it was an inconvenient location I only got about ten customers per night, I was kinda paid to sit and do my homework/read lol.)


This one night in particular was going fine, it was nearly the end of my shift and I was reading an exciting part of my book! Then, I look up from my reading to see a man stumbling towards the glass door. The site of him makes my heart stop, and I silently thank my dad for his suggestion to keep the door locked at night. This obviously drunk man reaches the store front and automatically pulls at the door to walk in as he approaches, and grabs at it a few more times when he finds that he cannot open it. 


I at this point stand up and go over to the door, and keeping it friendly I ask:""Hello, is there anything I can help you with?"" (Talking with the door closed of course.) 

The man replies, in a slurred voice: ""I need help. I've lost my wife. She was with me just a moment ago, and I don't know wheres she's gone."" And he covers his face with his hands and makes the most fake attempt at sobbing I have ever seen, then makes eerie tearless eye contact with me when I start speaking.  


Me: ""I'm sorry, would you like me to call the police for you?""

Creep: ""Nooo noo. I don't know where my wife is."" *does the cover face, fake cry again* ""All I want is some comforting, can I sit down with you for a while? I just need to talk."" He gives me an intense look and smiles. 

Me: ""I will call the police for you if you need. I'm sorry I really can't help you.""


At this point I am scared shitless. I am keeping my tone controlled and hoping with every fiber of my being that he will just go away and not try to break in. I have a knife in my pocket, and am wondering to myself if I would actually have to nerve to stab him if it came down to protecting myself. 

The man proceeds to plead to let him into the store, I firmly say no, and after a few minutes he goes off still muttering about losing his wife, casting glances back at me the whole walk back to the street. 

I then call my parents and have them come down immediately so to watch out for me as I count the money to cash out. I had a lot of weird stories stem from this job, but this was the time I think I felt most in danger...


TLDR; At work, drunk guy comes up and tries to harass me into ""comforting"" him because he supposively lost track of his wife."	t5_2t3t8	True
1335418081.0	st58m	The time [I] almost got gang raped in the basement of a Subway sandwich restaurant. (Trigger warning, obvs.)	ghostlamp	198	48	94	"I was in my second year of college and my girlfriends and I wanted to hit up a new club that had just opened recently in downtown Toronto (now defunct, called CiRCa). The only problem was that we went to school in Etobicoke, which is technically a part of the Greater Toronto Area, but the only way to get there would be to take an hour long transit ride (not worth it because our bus from the subway station stopped at 10 PM) or drive.

Monique, Josie and I enlisted our friend Ashley to drive because she wanted to come, but she hadn't been eating/was feeling sick so she didn't want to drink. Great, a DD! We predrank, played drinking games, got into Ashley's car and rode our way to the club.

The club was a lot of fun, until my friends and I noticed Ashley passed out on the ground. Turns out, she had been drinking cranberry and vodkas all night and was totally wasted. We haul her upstairs to a lounge area to figure out what to do next, when she suddenly runs to the bathroom to throw up. I follow her and notice she is throwing up blood. Freaking the fuck out, I navigate her back to the lounge area and try and figure out what to do with my other friends.

Ashley absolutely refused to go to a hospital. She was beyond wasted and she didn't have her health card on her, so we decided to get some food into her. We drag her out of the club and head over to the Subway (restaurant) on Queen, about a block or so away from the club.

While we were eating, a group of guys were chatting us up. We asked them what we should do and they gave us a bunch of hostels to try out. We thank them, they leave, and we try and get Ashley to leave.
Not happening. She refuses. She wants to eat her soup first. Groaning, Monique, Josie and I decide to let her finish it. While we are waiting, this group of Armenian guys come in. They sit in the booths around us, talking to us. One guy in particular is interested in me and kept asking me to have sex with him in the bathroom in the basement. I was obviously creeped out, so I said that I didn't think it was a good idea. He asked for my phone number, so I gave him a fake one. He called it and asked why my phone didn't ring, I told him my battery was dead.

Ashley was taking her sweet ass time eating her soup and all of the sudden I had to pee really bad. I asked Monique to come with me to the bathroom, to which she agreed. As we were getting up, all the guys around us get up to, following us down the stairs. As I get into the washroom, all I see is Monique slam the door behind me and say, ""What are you doing?""
The one guy who was interested in me said, ""Let me through, baby.""
She responded with, ""I thought you had to go to the bathroom? She can go to the bathroom herself. You can wait.""

I finished my business, washed my hands and opened the door. Monique grabs my hand and all of the sudden the guys start forming a circle around us. At this point, we were freaked the fuck out so before they get a chance to really do anything, we shove our way through, practically fly up the stairs, barge into the restaurant and scream at Ashley and Josie to get the fuck up and that we were leaving. The four of us dive into a cab that was conveniently driving near us and tell him to just drive - wherever.
Needless to say, I was fucking horrified. Honestly, it was one of the most terrifying moments of my life."	t5_2t3t8	True
1335105022.0	smmvz	Stared Down	wtstephens	185	32	17	"Many years ago when I was about 13 y.o. I was active in the Boy Scouts. One August weekend we had traveled to a state park in rural WV. This trip would be the first time most of us have gone spelunking (caving), including the adults; there was a general mix of anxiety and excitement in each us, as we had little idea as to what to expect.

We arrived on Friday evening, setting up camp before the last light of the day disappeared. For dinner we quickly boiled hotdogs, scarfing them down so we could fish as the water cooled for the night. If memory serves me correct, there was a little lake within view of our campground. We stayed there for a matter of a few hours, using a variety of lures and methods - to no avail. When it got to be about 11:30, Seth (my best friend at the time) and I decided we were going to get up early to fish. You see, we were staying at a campground in West Virginia but we would get in a car the next day to travel to Ohio to the caves. If we were to wake up early, we could buy more time to do what we wanted to do - catch some trout. Not only that, neither of us had a trout license so if we were to get up early then none of the adults would able to stop us. Win-win.

At 3:00 AM my watch alarm beeps, waking me  up. I didn't care that I hadn't slept but three hours, I felt invigorated. I rouse Seth from sleep, as we silently gather our fishing equipment, slip on our boots and make the trek out.

The night was clear and cool. We didn't need to bring flashlights, as the full moon provided enough glow to easily navigate our way. We didn't follow a trail, instead we started walking at the lake and followed the conjoining creek upstream in hopes of finding a shallower area where the trout would be stuck on their travels upstream.

We followed the creak, even past a fence that noted we were arriving on private property. We were kids, and had little reason to care. We continued to walk in silence, about three miles overall. As we walked, the trees and brush thickened. We expected as much, as we had seen a map of the area and there were no roads or trails that ran out here. We were completely immersed in nature - or so we thought until we ran into a cabin in the woods.

The cabin was relatively small, only roughly 12x12 ft. It was constructed out of pale cinderblock. I would have assumed it was a storage facility of some kind if there was not one major detail that stuck out. On the side facing us, there was a window. Through the frosted window, the pale blue light of a television glared.

We had still not reached the fishing spot we were looking for, so I leaned over and whispered to Seth that the person must have fallen asleep watching TV. I mean, it was the most logical conclusion, right? I know it is common for rural people to rise early, but 4:00 AM? There could be now way... 

We stepped lighly beside the hut to try to pass it, but I stopped dead in my tracks when Seth's arm jutted out across my chest, signaling me to keep still.

The resident of the hut was standing int he window, staring at us.

We could not make out his face through the frosted glass, but we didn't need to. We refused to move, as the chances of the individual being able to see us clearly were low. Hopefully he would play it off as a deer and go back to watching TV and probably sipping on his beer.

But he never sat down. He definitely saw us. But 10 feet away this grown man was staring at two kids through the window. Thoughts began to race through our minds. What would he do to us? Why was he up at 4:00 AM to begin with? Was he even the real resident of this hut, or just hiding out - as there were no roads around? 

The answer to these questions did not matter - all the mattered was the fact that this guy was continuing to stare at us, two frozen 13 year olds alone in the woods. I began to hear a thud, I assumed it was from the television. The thud became slightly louder until my vision began fluctuating with the repetitious noise and I realized it was my heart. Yet, I remained still. I shut my eyes and focused everything I had on remaining perfectly statue-like. I breathed in my nose and out my mouth. In my nose and out my mouth. This went on for a full 10-15 minutes (though it felt like a half hour or more), until I breathed in my nose and out... out... oh crap I had to sneeze. I pressed my tongue against the roof of my mouth in hopes of suppressing it, but I could not refrain.

I sneezed. The guy in the windows sneezed, too.

It wasn't a window, it was a square sign. That wasn't TV, that was the reflection of the light of the moon. That wasn't someone staring at us, that was my silhouette against the moon.

This was the most petrified I've been in my own life. Turns out, I was scared of my own shadow."	t5_2t3t8	True
1370768586.0	1fz31a	Creepy 'Doctor' Loves Young Boys	ghostcockfighter	177	26	13	"Wow, I just discovered this subreddit and have enjoyed reading / been repulsed by your stories. It's very compelling stuff and I felt inspired to share my own rather paltry contribution with you all.

Like many, I spent the late '90s, early '00s absolutely obsessed with skateboarding and devoted time to going skating nearly every day. When you live in the city and you're out at all hours of the day and night you're gonna meet all manner of psychos, especially as the search for good spots often leads you to some pretty unsavoury places. I've been attacked and chased a bunch of times but the creepiest encounter was far more mundane.

The first time I met the Doctor, I was alone. I had skipped school to go and skate a bowl that sat in a huge, leafy park. This park is relatively safe, but like any big innercity park, it attracted some undesirables. The public toilets in particular were a favourite of junkies, deviants and pedophiles. This day, I remember I was skating shirtless, probably on account of the heat. As I skated through the afternoon, I slowly became aware of an older man leaning on the fence watching me. He rounded the fence and came over to the bowl, trying to get my attention. He looked harmless enough, a very hirsute middle-aged man who looked vaguely mediterranean, slightly overweight and dressed in smart casual. It was a hot summer day and he was a bit sweaty and flustered.

He greeted me enthusiastically, and quickly began to tell me how wonderful he thought it was to 'see a young boy outside doing exercise'. He continued, more or less just extrapolating on youngsters and fitness.  At this point, I had no reason to be suspicious, although his rant was certainly peculiar. 'In my country, we love young boy!' he exclaimed once or twice, funny in hindsight. English was clearly not his first language and he talked kind of like the Borat character. After a beat, he continued, telling me how he worked at a gym as some kind of doctor, hence his interest in fitness I guess, and produced his identity card. This is where alarm bells started ringing, as his ID was just a gym membership which he'd scrawled ""DR."" on with permanent marker across one side of the card.

The doctor then asked me if I'd be willing to come to his home and help teach him English, for 50 dollars. I politely declined and suggested he find someone qualified but he became particularly insistent, once again bringing up youth fitness, his 'work with boys' and how we had a connection. He was getting a bit handsy and I was feeling increasingly uncomfortable, particularly as my top was bare. To get him off my back I told him I'd think about it and went back to skating.

It couldn't have been more than a few days later, I'd once again skipped out to skate the bowl and this time there was a younger boy there, perhaps 12 years of age. For some reason, there were pages torn from porn magazines scattered all around the bowl that afternoon. We skated, mostly ignoring each other until I noticed the doctor lurking about by the fence. When we noticed him, he came around again, and seemed confused by the porn. He picked up a page and kept asking us 'You like that? You like that?'. This time I was mostly ignored and he focused all of his attentions on the 12 year old kid, even making the same offer he had made to me. After he'd finally left, I pulled the kid aside and told him to absolutely avoid that guy at all costs.

I thought that'd be the end of it but nope, I started to bump into the Doctor everywhere, even outside of the bowl. He was always asking me personal questions and hassling me to go with him and offering me money. When I did skate at the bowl, he'd show up and watch me. Once I was skating with a friend and the Doctor showed up quite unexpectedly with two bottles of ice-cold Coke for us. I'm a bit ashamed to admit that after he'd fucked off, we drank them (although we thoroughly checked that they hadn't been tampered with). Hey, it was a hot day!

I began to get annoyed at his constant harassment and stalking and I'd noticed how like with the 12 year old and some other youngsters his attentions were focused across a number of people. I made these thoughts known to an adult skateboarder who I often sessioned with down at the bowl, a tall, muscular and heavily tattooed guy who told me he'd keep an eye out.

A few days later, my older friend returned and told me he'd seen him lurking around the bowl, approaching young boys and talking to them. He'd pulled the Doc aside and had a serious chat with him. I never saw the Doctor after that again.

I'm afraid there's no real climax to this story, but with what could have happened, that's probably for the best. Be safe."	t5_2t3t8	True
1364413581.0	1b4o3d	Shoefucker	drukqsx	190	39	22	"I didn't have a bus in high school because I lived only a mile away from the school, so I always had to walk. One day on my way home I was taking a shortcut through a parking lot when out of nowhere a car sped into the lot through the exit, and cut me off. I couldn't help but think that it seemed intentional, and it became clear that I was right when he start rolled down his window and began waving me over. I was alone, and suddenly very aware of the fact that I was a very small, 15 year old female. All I could think was, ""wonderful. I'm about to get abducted.""

I'm terrible at reacting well under pressure so I actually walked up to this dude's car before I even realized what I was doing. The 30-something year old man inside the car was giving me this huge, cheshire cat grin and seemed to be trying to contain his excitement as well as he could. As I got closer to the open window his excitement got the better of him and he blurted out, ""Can I buy your shoes?"" pointing to the very worn out black/white checkered slip on vans on my feet. They had holes in them and were pretty much brown by that point instead of white. They were far from nice looking shoes. Part of me thought he was kidding. 

He asked again, offering me $40 for them. I only paid $30. This random guy was trying to buy an old, beat up pair of shoes right off my feet for more than I paid for them in the first place. It was such a strange request and it had caught me so off guard that in my confusion I could only respond with, ""what?"" He started begging. He said, ""please, they're exactly what I'm looking for. They're perfect. I need them"" and repeatedly insisted ""I'll do anything!"" I started to register how creepy up the situation was. What would a 30-something year old man possibly want with a pair of size 7 girls' shoes? I didn't really know what to do or say, it was just so weird. I was just down the street from my house so I sort of awkwardly laughed and said no and continued trying to walk home.

He began driving next to me slowly, pleading for the ancient, dirty shoes I was wearing. He said, ""You drive a hard bargain, honey. Ok, $60!"" I started thinking about making a run for it, knowing running would be no use if he wanted to follow me since he had a car and could easily keep up. Besides, his car was completely blocking my path so I wouldn't be able to get away anyway. And even if I could somehow make it around him, we were already on my street so he'd have no trouble figuring out where I lived. I swear, it was like my brain had shut off completely. I had no idea what to do, and couldn't even figure out what any of my options were. I forgot about the cellphone in my pocket; I didn't consider running in the direction I was coming from; I didn't even think I could scream if he were to try and grab me.

The more nervous I got the more confident this guy seemed. He started talking in what I thought was supposed to be a calm, soothing voice but it only sounded cold and demanding to me. I could tell his patience was running out. He was tapping the steering wheel with his hand and was no longer smiling. In a suddenly aggressive tone he urged, ""come on, just do it already."" I felt trapped and my mind actually started wandering towards the idea of just giving in and getting kidnapped. Like I said, I couldn't remember a single way out of there, and it seemed like the only option I had left. With a look of absolute resentment on his face he said, ""are you kidding me? You must be kidding me."" Then I noticed the car door was opened just a crack and that he looked ready to pounce. Becoming visibly frustrated he groaned, ""fine, $80."" I didn't know what to do.

...So I took my shoes off and sold them to a stranger for $80. And he didn't even kidnap me. He legitimately just wanted my old, shitty shoes. I walked the rest of the way barefoot, and when I got home I found the new shoes I had ordered online waiting for me on the porch.

After dinner, I went to call the dogs in and I noticed my cats were out as well, and ""talking"" as we call it.

1330990542.0	qjakm	A *True* Story of a Brush With Death (x-post from r/nosleep)	dame_condor	175	24	17	"I can tell you that this story is not fabricated. Every word of it is true, according to my mother. I don't know what I can do to authenticate the following, so I suppose it's my word against yours, but it has definitely given me something to ponder for years upon years. So, here it goes: the story I've told only to those closest to me, for fear of rejection otherwise.

I grew up in a wooded region of upstate New York in a little town called Minisink, approximately sixty miles north of the city. Although my parents at the time were struggling with extended family issues, as well as finances, I can recall only good things from my childhood. We lived on a 7-acre property with pines that littered our backyard and rolling hills in the front. It was an exemplary place to experience my childhood; rural and a friendly environment, with plenty of room for fun and activities. Neighbors were scarce, and vehicles were seldom.

In 1992, before I was old enough to remember anything (and could just barely walk), I was apparently outside in the front yard while my mom was on our porch, watching me and my older brother play relatively close to the road. All of a sudden, a blue hatchback came creeping up our street very slowly and paused to the entrance of our driveway. Again, this was odd not only for the fact that we lived in such a rural area, but the occasionally car we did see drove excessively fast since our road was pretty much barren of anyone and anything. My mother became concerned because, to her recollection, she had never seen this car before.

The man had apparently waved at my brother and I and smiled. Too young to comprehend the whole ""stranger"" rule, I had waved back and giggled and inquired my mother as to who was sitting outside our driveway. She quickly told us to go inside as she acknowledged the man. He looked her square in the eyes, expressionless before exposing a smile from ear-to-ear and raising his hand in a chilling wave, slowly descending and ascending each finger rhythmically. He proceeded to drive off, and my mother didn't allow us to go outside for the remainder of the day.

My mom told my father what occurred once he arrived from work, and he was indifferent over the situation. He suggested that we inform our neighbors of the incident the next evening and keep a neighborhood eye out on any suspicious activity, but other than that he was at a loss for what to do. He also decided to lock everything in the house, including the latches on the garage doors (which we rarely did). My parents had done everything in their power for protection and began to shake off what had happened once they were preparing to sleep.

My mom had a ritual of waking up at 3-3:30 in the morning and stepping outside in our garage for a cigarette. That particular morning she groggily stepped outside, sat on our freezer and had a smoke.

Towards the end of her session she heard a very subtle noise towards the automatic garage doors, but she couldn't put her finger on it. She sat and attentively listened before realizing that something or someone was turning the handle at the bottom of the door and lifting up. Paralyzed in fear, she heard the rattling for a few moments more until she quietly stepped into her bedroom and woke my father up. He grabbed our shotgun, went outside, but did not see anything. No one was there. However, my mom swore up and down like nothing before about how she would not mistake a noise like that, even in her most groggy state. She was certain, also, that it was the man she had seen earlier. An animal would have not been able to turn that handle, let alone attempt to lift it. All of our neighbors were older and very trust-worthy, too. We all kept in close contact with one another, and we all kept our eye out for one another as well. My parents informed the police about the man and there was patrol sent out to our area at night for a while, but nothing suspicious had turned up since then.

About a year later, my mother was in our living room watching the news when an important broadcast appeared. A serial killer had been caught in our county, dubbed the ""Robocop"" (Nathaniel White) because his killings were influenced from the movie. He had stabbed and beaten six people fairly close to our house, including a pregnant woman and a 14-year-old, and dumped their bodies in various places.

The man who was charged was undoubtedly the man who had stopped and waved at us. My mother is entirely positive and swears on her life. His face still sticks with her, with that evil grin reviewing my brother and I.

I wish my dad would've blown Nathaniel's brains out and sent that bastard to hell before he could kill again, but I'm just grateful that the watchful eye of my mom, and more importantly, a tiny metallic latch, prevented all of us from an untimely and grotesque death.

1330370726.0	q8gym	[MY] only stop at the Atlanta Greyhound Station.	cerem86	174	24	24	"Me again.  Gonna go ahead and say if you guys keep enjoying things from my life like the last one, I'll post up more.  I grew up around the types of people we post on here, and have had the luck to meet many of them.

This one is when I was stuck at the Atlanta Greyhound terminal for 18 hours.

I was 19, half a year out of high school.  Goofed off too much to get a scholarship, too poor to get into a college otherwise.  I was told about, and subsequently went to, Job Corps.  I decided to go for computer tech, and was told I could go to one of two centers in Kentucky.  The recruiter basically told me to go to one, and avoid the other.  I took his advice.

So getting to the center required me to get on a bus.  I would drive 2 hours west to Atlanta, connect there with a bus to Nashville, and from there another one to Bowling Green KY.  The bus to Atlanta, however, was late.  By two hours.  I'd missed my connection entirely.  The woman at the counter informed me the next bus going my route would be at 6AM, this was Noon.  Displeased was not the word.

So here I am, stuck at the terminal.  I had a ton of books as I was and still am an avid SF/F reader, I also had my luggage.  Bout it.  I had a LITTLE money for lunch, which was now going to be split between lunch/dinner/breakfast/lunch again.  And I had a phone card with 10 minutes on it.

7PM rolls around and it's DARK outside.  I'm sitting on a steel bench eating a sandwich I'd gotten from the cafateria.  Said cafateria is about to close.  A man limps up and begins to explain that he's poor and hungry and needs a buck for some food.  I explain I have no money to spare.  He mentions he saw me open my wallet and saw I do, and began demanding cash from me.

""Sir, my dad has been disabled since before I was born and he not once begged for money, much less in a shameless fashion like this.  I ain't got none so get out of my face.""  This just pissed him off.   He started cussing then walked off, limp-free.  I figured that was the end of that.

One of the problems about my situation was that I had two suitcases of crap sitting with me.  If i had to go to the bathroom I either took them into it, or made sure I was darn quick.  Asking someone to watch it was out, a guy I'd spoken with earlier informed me that if I did and they put something in my luggage and a cop found it, I was toast.

I dunno if that's true or not, but I wasn't taking any chances.  So I had to piss.  I made sure my stuff was zipped up, then zip tied the zippers together.

I step out of the bathroom to see the same guy from earlier sawing through the ziptie of one suitcase with a knife.  Naturally I step over and demand he stop.  The knife vanishes and he does almost as fast. I should have alerted the cop on duty there, but I was 19 and stupid and figured that was it.

About midnight I have to go again.  I do the same thing and step into the restroom.  Lock the stall door behind me.  A second later someone kicks it, and then this voice begins explaining how they're going to gut me and kill me for being a disrespectful little shit.

About the time I got done pissing, I heard a new noise.  Sounded like someone clapping.  I heard the guy say ""Warming this up for you now boy"".  

Stall door opens.  Guy's standing there with a knife in one hand and his cock in the other, pants around his ankles.  Comical if I wasn't at this point scared.  I do what I do best.  I kick him in the stomach.  He falls over and I begin screaming bloody fucking murder.

On duty cop steps in, sees this guy with his pants off and a hard on trying to slice at my ankles, and pulls out his gun.  The guys drops the knife, gets handcuffed, and gets hauled out of there without his pants.  I have to file a report, and almost miss my bus going to TN."	t5_2t3t8	True
1329712041.0	pxcmf	His Name was David	evilblackbunny	191	42	66	"I had a friend. His name was David.

I met him in tenth grade. I don't remember when we started talking, but I remember that I was talking about Stargate SG-1. There was a guy behind me, and he was rather excited that I was a girl as well as a fan. We talked. I laughed. He spoke great Gou'ald, and told me an a deep, powerful voice, 'Jafa, cree!' I knew what it meant, and I stood at attention. He laughed, clapped, and grinned. I liked his grin. I liked him, too. He was tall, and strong, and smart. He never bragged about things, but he was smart. I could tell by his eyes.

We would talk from time to time, and we would always end things on a good note. He had a girlfriend, so I didn't even try. I am not, despite what a few people say, a man stealer. Even after they broke up, I didn't go for him. He was too good for me. He was sweet, and quiet, and a little dorky. And, at least to me, he was cute. Also, he was great with hugs. I never had to ask. It was like he knew. His hugs were great, and warm, and made me feel like I wasn't gross.

The next year of school began, and I took welding. I felt powerful, torch in had, working with raw material, one of only three girls in a class of burly, silly men. David took cooking, and boy, was he amazing. He never bragged about his skills or how good he was. He just smiled and shared his food... or more gave us his food seeing that he never really ate it. I always looked forward to seeing him, because I could sit next to him and forget the buzz around me for a while. I rarely ate in the mornings. I felt fat, really, thinking that the first thing I had to do was eat.

I always felt weird, and I knew that normal people were boring. That was one of the things that made David so good. He was like me. He even had hypersensitive hearing. He understood what it was like to hear more than you wanted to. He told me once, during a huge bout of rain storms, that he heard the storm starting, while the TV was blaring, and his mom was on the phone, and the windows were shut. I smiled, eyes wide. Finally, someone else knew what I heard all my life; everything.

I forgot my book one day for out loud reading. I hated my teacher. I swear to this day she was a homophobe, and a racist. She didn't like white boys, and she certainly didn't like girls in dog collars. I didn't want her to mark me down for the day, but what could I do? No one in that class liked me, save for David and some dude named Adam. Adam was nice, if only because he left me the hell alone. David sat in front of me, and Adam in front of him.

So, the books came out, and we began to read 'Catcher In The Rye', and when my turn came up, something touched my leg. I looked down, and there was David's hand, passing his book back to me. I took it, and mouthed a thank you. He nodded and smiled. I gave it back when I was done reading. I thanked him later, and he said not to worry about it. People always thought I was weird, and they all called him weird, too. That was why we got along, I guess.

Well, I was sick for a few days and missed some school near the end of eleventh grade. Everything felt wrong, and weird, and everyone was talking about David. I asked around, but they all just looked at me and didn't tell me anything. Some kept asking me if I knew who I sat next to, and the answer was always the same; David. They made fun of me because I didn't know. I went to Jeff, and I asked him. He's one of the sweetest guys I know. His soft face twisted into a pinched and outraged mask. He told me. Jeff told me everything.

On the evening of March Twentieth, 2009, a babysitter took the two children she was sitting to a park. The younger child had to go to the bathroom, and the sitter took him home to go, leaving the seven year old girl alone. Time passed. The sitter returned, but the girl was missing. She looked for the girl, and found her, but something was wrong. The girl told the sitter that a man came to her, and asked her for help with something. The sitter called the police. The police took the girl to the hospital. There was evidence that someone had done a sick, sick thing to her.

The evidence pointed to a seventeen year old male in our area.

The police arrested David.

David had raped a seven year old girl.

1374619879.0	1ix0ts	Little Old Lady	CrypticSpork	172	25	13	"After lurking and reading some of the stories here, I decided to contribute my own.

My mother, little sister and I used to go for walks after school in the park. We would walk/jog for probably around an hour every evening. Living in a small sheltered area, we'd never really had any reasons to be scared. 
Anyway, we're walking together on the circular path and my mom stops cold and tells us not to go any further. She was looking straight ahead so of course we looked in the direction she was, wondering wtf was going on.  
We saw what appeared to be a little old hunched over lady walking very slowly ahead of us. She looked out of place but it wasn't unheard of for the elderly to get some exercise. 
Of course we asked mom what was wrong, she wouldn't even tell us.. just told us it was time to go and that we should really be heading back to our car. 
We were confused but didn't argue. When we made it to our car, mom still wouldn't tell us what was going on.. not until we were about 5 minutes away from the park area. 

Apparently, as we were walking along, mom said the ""little old hunched over lady"" stood straight up and was a 6ft+ male. He was dressed as an elderly lady, prowling the park I suppose. Although I didn't see it happen personally, I know my mom well enough to understand that she would've never acted like she did if she didn't feel something was terribly amiss. 

Some time later, a man was arrested a few miles outside of the park area. His trunk was filled with ropes, tape, toys, and an array of other items... not to mention his old lady garb. 

Yes, I do believe we were walking behind a child rapist/murderer. If he actually commited any crime to that extent, I really can't say. I surely hope not. I have never seen my mother react in the manner that she did that night, I think her instincts kicking in scared me more than the actual predator that was among us. Gives me chills. I was 14-15 then, I'm 26 now. "	t5_2t3t8	True

When I was about 12, I had a lot of issues with night terrors, and rarely slept a whole night through. One night, I got up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. I sat down, half asleep and thinking of nothing but emptying my bladder and going back to bed when I see movement out of the corner of my eye. There was a man standing by the other door to the bathroom staring at me, not moving. He was wearing a tattered grey jump suit and had a crutch or cane, little to no hair. 

I don't remember how I got down into the basement where my parents slept but suddenly there I was, hysterical. My dad finally went up and looked in the bathroom and kitchen. Saw nothing but allowed me to sleep on the couch down there anyway. I didn't fall back asleep. About an hour or so later, I heard the sliding door to the bathroom from my sisters room and foot steps. The next morning my dad searched around and noticed that the fridge and pantry had been raided. Never caught the guy."	t5_2t3t8	True
1345491538.0	yjet4	"Creepy ""hostel"" owner."	_lobster_	175	26	16	"A few years ago I worked for a well-known hostel in Seattle.

I worked the graveyard shift, so most of my shift was spent processing reservations and surfing the web. This was actually when I discovered reddit!

Anyway, one night I noticed an ad on craigslist about a new hostel that had opened in south Seattle. Being bored/curious I gave the guy a call to find out about his rates, accommodations, etc.
He answers with a dry ""hello"", I ask if I have called the right number for a hostel and he responds with a quick ""Oh yeah, yeah, how can I help you?""

I don't mention that I'm an employee at another hostel and instead inquire about the location, price, typical stuff.

He tells me that the location is hard to describe and it would be best if I just met him at the closest convenience store and he would take me to the hostel from there.
""No thank you."" Click. I had heard all I needed to hear.

Throughout the rest of my time at my hostel, there would be times that we were full and would give suggestions to visitors on places to stay. I made it a point to mention this place as an ""anti-suggestion.""

One guest actually informed me that he had stayed there a few months before and it was in fact, something to stay away from.

The ""hostel"", I am told was basically an old house that had been completely gutted so as to be two big rooms, a kitchen and a large room with bunk beds. Dirt floor, and a television in the room with the bunk beds.

No travelers, just crackheads and tweakers who had clearly been living there for some time. No staff, dude picked him up at the convenience store as offered, brought him to the ""hostel"", took his money and left.

TL/DR: If you're looking for a hostel in Seattle, go with a reputable one.

1345233422.0	ye6d8	The 5th floor isn't safe	no_malis	180	32	24	"Hi,

This happened a while ago when I lived in Brussels. I was 7 years old turning eight in a few weeks and went for a sleepover at my friend Lorenzo's. He lived with his mom on the 4th floor of a big appartment building in the center of the city. Neither his father nor his older brother (around 20-ish) were home since they were in the military and both off on duty somewhere (can't exactly remember where, but probably middle east, the Gulf War was on at the time).

Anyways, as all kids at that age we were super psyched about the sleepover and supercharged with sweets, so we weren't feeling very sleepy! Lorenzo's mom tried to tell us to go to sleep, but as soon as she hit the pillows herself (with the help of a few sleeping pills) we were back up and playing again, only with the lights off.

A little after midnight we noticed two shadows against the window. Two men were climbing up the wall. However, in our young minds, this was hilarious. All along their slow creep up across the window from bottom to top we talked to them, making fun, even calling names (""hey poopy-face, don't slip, you'll fall in poop""). We fell asleep after they were passed.

The next morning we told Lorenzo's mom about the men. She paled and called the police. It turned out that they were robbers. They went for the appartment above us, on the 5th floor. Since the tenants, an old retired couple, weren't cooperating they tortured and killed them."	t5_2t3t8	True
1339984602.0	v7cha	No More Closing Shifts	mozzybear	171	22	29	"Hello all! I've been a long time lurker on LetsNotMeet, and I thought I might share one of my scary experiences that I had about a year ago.

To start off, let me just say that I live in a pretty gated community. Small town, small high school, good people, everybody knows everybody--that sort of town. I live along the shoreline and am about 5 minutes from the beach, so in the summer time the town population practically triples as out-of-towners flock to their summer beach houses. My friends and I shared a mutual dislike for these people because they all would walk along the main roads with no shirts on, trashing a lot of the public areas, and driving carelessly on the roads, but I digress...

Last May, I was 17 and I began my first job at an ice cream shop and deli centered right on the busiest street in town. Now, my town is also very populated by elderly people, mostly people who have retired, as well as a lot of families. It wasn't really a town where you'd see many people between the ages of 20 - 30. It was very, very safe.

Anyways, this one instance occurred back in August of 2011 (I had been working there for about 3 months.) I came in for a 4 to close shift, which is normally around 9. We stay open a little later if there's a late night after-dinner rush, so after cleaning up the shop my co-workers and I would leave by about 10. I started my shift with my co-worker Kenny who's 20, and he ran the deli while I ran the ice cream.
My bosses had gone out for the day and left the employees in charge, (they don't leave often, so this was rare,) and it was just me and Kenny in the shop that evening.
It was a slow day and I had just signed in and began cleaning behind the counter when Kenny approached me and said, ""If some guy comes in asking for Carl and Irene, tell him they're not here."" My bosses were very personable with customers so they had a lot of friends in town so it wasn't uncommon for customers to ask for them.

""I figured to say that since they're not here,"" I replied with an ""I-Got-This"" attitude.

Kenny nodded and said, ""Yeah well this one dude's come in twice since we opened and has been asking if they're around. If you see him, he's got a bristly brown beard,"" he motioned to his face, ""and he was wearing a black tee shirt and a Mets hat.""
I nodded and continued cleaning. The afternoon dragged on but at about 6:15 who showed up? That exact man. He walked through the doors and I glanced over to Kenny who shot me a look from the deli. The man slapped his palms on the counter and hunched in as he asked, ""You still makin' sandwiches little miss?""

""No sir,"" I replied, eyes darting from him to Kenny, ""the deli closes at 6 in the summer, but you're welcome to come back tomorrow for lunch or get ice cream now.""

He let out a wheezy laugh, ""Shoot, I guess I'll just have to do ice cream then!""
Kenny was still eyeing the guy as I served him an ice cream, so he paid and decide to stand inside, lingering and reading our sandwich menu. ""Good ice cream ya got here,"" he mumbled. 

""It's all home-made,"" I said without looking up from my cleaning.

""Yer bosses here? Y'know, Carl and Irene? I want to compliment them on this stuff. Hella good.."" He approached the counter and I sensed something a little strange about him. He was probably in his late 30s, but he looked like he was the type of person who didn't have a girlfriend or wife or family, kinda the trailer-park type with dirt on his jeans and hands and sweat in his beard. 

""Nope, they're not available right now, sorry to inform you,"" I swiftly moved into the dipping cabinet to occupy myself with scraping down ice cream. I was sure he was just a summer traveler and creeper, but what else could he do when there were customers sitting outside eating? I felt pretty safe with people around, but as I leaned into the cabinet, I saw him loom over me from the other side of the glass. Watching me. For a good 5 minutes. It got even weirder when he asked in a lower voice, ""You know they make roadkill ice cream down south?"" He laughed that ugly, wheezy laugh and said, ""Can you imagine? But I bet even your boss could make it into tasty ice cream.""
I didn't respond, only with a fake snort of amusement.
He continued to watch me.
""What time you open until?"" he asked, making eye contact as I came out of the dipping cabinet.
""Nine."" I responded curtly. Was I creeped out? You bet!
I noped out of there and busied myself in the back kitchen with dishes and eventually the guy left. I heaved a sigh of relief, but it was all restored when Kenny came back with deli utensils and warned, ""If he comes back again, I'm calling Carl and Irene.""

7 rolls around, then 8, 8:30, still no sign of the man. Finally it's 9:12 PM and I serve my last customers. The second they leave, Kenny locks the front doors and we begin our closing routine; he covers the ice cream while I sweep. Our bosses weren't coming back to check on the shop until 11 so we were by ourselves...or so we thought.
Kenny was running the dishes in the back while I wiped everything down when I saw headlights pulling up. Figuring the late customers would see we were closed, I went back to wiping. Suddenly there was a pounding on the doors. My heart sank a little as I looked up to see a Mets logo moving around outside. I nervously shook my head and pointed to my wrist indicating the time. He continued to bang on the doors and shout, ""C'mon pretty lady, I NEED to talk to your bosses! Are they back yet?!""

I called back to Kenny who had heard the ruckus and approached the doors and confronted the man, clearly ticked off. Kenny argued with the man, who was quite persistent, saying he ""needed"" to see Carl before tomorrow and how he ""knew they were back there."" Kenny shooed the man away, locked the doors and turned to me and muttered, ""Fucking weirdo."" I asked if he'd call Carl and he said it probably wasn't worth it at this time of night since they'd be home soon.

At this point, it was around quarter of 10. We were finishing up our cleaning and I was mopping while Kenny stood at the register looking over the receipts. It was quiet and he walked to the safe in back to switch out money for the register. Out of fucking nowhere there's a voice at the screen door on the side of the shop (for employees to leave and enter) that said, ""Shame if blood got on these nice clean floors.""
Whipping around, I see the man standing behind the screen door with a knife in his hand and a grizzly scowl plastered on his face. I screamed at the top of my lungs as he tries to push open the door, which had a measly little shift-lock, like in a bathroom stall. He takes the knife and starts jabbing it through the screen and tearing it open. ""Tell that little shit to come back out here and we'll talk like men!"" This psycho was coming into the shop. With a fucking knife. His first foot kicked through and stepped onto the tile. I was practically in tears when Kenny screamed for me to run into the back, so I high-tailed it all the way through the kitchen and into the back office connecting directly to the kitchen, separated by a thick door with a deadbolt. We lock the door and I crumble to my knees, crying, as Kenny calls 911. The man had gotten through the screen door, but we heard him rummaging in the front of the shop. The man was cackling that ""we weren't being very kind treating a customer like this,"" and taunting us. 

After about 5 minutes, it became totally silent. The police showed up and our bosses came home immediately, finding me and Kenny shaken up as we go through the events of the night.
Turns out, the intruder took the money in the register and had gotten away with a vehicle, though we didn't know what kind because it was dark when he actually drove up to the shop. We didn't hear much about him afterwards, but my bosses didn't stay open after 7 for the next two weeks in fear that the man would come back. He never came back. 
After that, I insisted working only in the mornings an day times, and the shop installed an alarm system that would activate at 9:30. We also got a replacement for the screen door that was, well, ACTUALLY a door.

Kenny and I both still work at the shop and sometimes joke about the crazy man, but I often wonder if the man's motive was the money he took, or victims to try that road-kill ice cream he was talking about...


Tl;dr: A co-worker and I are closing the ice cream shop we work at when a crazy man makes his way in with a knife."	t5_2t3t8	True
1335558824.0	svtsq	College Party Vampire	imafluffybunneh	176	30	53	"This happened to me back when I was in college. I went with a group of friends to a house party off-campus. One person in our group knew the owners of the house but other than that the only people we knew there were each other. I was one of two designated ""moms"" (sober people) responsible for taking care of everyone else as they drank themselves into a stupor.

I danced with some of my friends for a while but later on in the night I was sick of having various mixed drinks spilled on me and it was too hot in the basement so I went upstairs for some air. I went out onto the porch and sat on the railing when I felt a hand grab my shoulder. I turned around and saw a guy I'd never seen before. He was really cute, dark skin and hair. Even though he had startled me, I got over it pretty quickly because he was so good looking.

He introduced himself as Luis and told me he thought I was the most beautiful girl he'd seen, that he had been watching me all night and he wanted to dance with me. I was pretty surprised but agreed and took his hand as he led me back downstairs. The party was packed, and everyone was pressed up against each other in a hot, sweaty mess. We danced together for a bit to some crappy college party songs.

He started kissing my neck, wet, sloppy kisses that made me uncomfortable. I wanted to ask him to stop, but it isn't every day an attractive guy wants to kiss you, so I let it happen. Besides, the party was loud and crowded so he probably wouldn't have been able to hear a word I said. I let it go on for a bit and looked around for my friends. I saw my friend Rob out of the corner of my eye, and it was a good thing, too.

Luis had progressed from kissing my neck to biting it. Not nibbling, but full on gnawing and chewing on it like a vampire with no eye teeth. It hurt badly. I felt my eyes tear up from the pain and I pushed him away. ""I have to get back to my friends,"" I yelled to him, then worked my way back to where I had seen Rob. He was standing there with a drink in his hand and I shouted at him to dance with me.

He knew something was wrong so he obliged, then yelled in my ear, ""What happened to your neck?"" I touched the place where it was burning and my hand came away with a bit of blood on my fingertips--he had broken the skin. I felt sick to my stomach and Rob asked if we could go upstairs because he had to go to the bathroom (and was too drunk to go on his own).

Standing in the bathroom I checked out the damage to my neck. It wasn't terrible, but there were a lot of teeth marks and a few places where he had ripped through the skin. I cleaned up the little bit of blood, helped Rob get himself together, and left the bathroom. As we left I came face-to-face with Luis, who seemed pissed.

""Who is this?"" he asked, pointing at Rob. I told him Rob was a friend of mine and I was just helping him in the bathroom. ""Whatever,"" Luis said. ""You probably can't even remember my name."" He was very angry, and I told him gently that of course I remembered his name. I assumed he had too much to drink and asked if he was alright. ""I'm sober,"" he insisted. He had this weird crazy eyes thing going on that creeped me out a bit; he obviously had something wrong with him, and I told him I was going downstairs to be with my friends now. He grabbed my wrists and pushed me against the wall. ""You're staying with me,"" he said. He was quite a bit bigger than me and he was hurting me with the force he was using to hold me in place. Rob had wandered drunkenly downstairs without me around the same time Luis had popped up and everyone around us was too drunk to notice or care what was going on. I just nodded and said ""I'm not going anywhere, you're hurting me, please let go.""

He eased up a bit and then insisted that I didn't remember his name. I reminded him again that I remembered his name and then tried to slide my hands away from him. He let it happen but wrapped his arm around my waist so tightly I couldn't get away (in the morning I checked and found four fingertip-sized bruises on my stomach where he had pressed them into me. My wrists ended up bruised too, this guy was obviously not playing around). At this point I was scared and started looking around for the other ""mom"", Kelly, who I knew would be sober and could help me out.

Luis pulled me outside back onto the porch. He held me against the railing again and started pulling the neck of my tank top down. I told him as sternly as I could to stop but he squeezed my wrists harder behind my back and told me to shut up or he would hurt me. He ducked his head down and bit into my breast, hard. I cried out (probably said some bad words) and felt him sucking the place he had bitten. I was crying hard at this point when I saw my friends in a group upstairs getting ready to leave. The sliding glass door was open and I yelled Kelly's name. When she looked at me she could tell I obviously was not having fun.

She marched over and tapped Luis's shoulder. ""My friend needs to leave now, sorry."" I think he was so surprised he let go of me, and in that second Kelly had grabbed me and was half dragging, half carrying me out the door and down to the street with our friends. I was so thankful. We made our rounds getting all our friends home and safely put to bed, and then she and I went up to my room. She helped me wash off the places he had bitten me with water and antibacterial soap and then sat in my bed with me until I fell asleep.

I'm certain this person can't have been sober. If he was.... ugh. I'm just glad I'll never (hopefully) see him again. People are friends, not food."	t5_2t3t8	True

Went down into the basement after the GF left. The dust around one of the windows to the backyard is gone, and we never clean those. Thinking this is probably where someone got in. Yet, no signs of anything else misplaced/missing in the house. Will keep you updated.

1355896276.0	153g8q	The Man in the Cowboy Hat	raisethishand	171	24	16	"I'm a twenty year old woman from Pennsylvania, this is the story of my stalker. This is kind of long, but it takes place over about five years.

I moved into my new house with my Mom and two younger brothers in the winter of 2000, I was eight years old. 
Everything went fine for almost two years, but in the summer of 2002 Bill moved in next door. I thought he was weird, he was tall and always wore this old cowboy hat. He knew my name almost immediately, but knew nothing of my brothers (he called them Jack and Tom, which weren't their names at all). He would invite me into his house for cookies or to watch movies, but I always declined.

When I was twelve, he came up to our porch and asked if he could give me a valentine. My mom was creeped out and told him to stay the hell away from me (rightfully so). Then in the spring, he called my unlisted number while my mom was at work. He told me that he saw my dog run out of the house. I was stupid and went outside to look, Bill was out waiting for me and tried to urge me to call the police from his phone. I felt really weird and told him that I would call from mine. As soon as I walked into my house I saw my dog run down the stairs to greet me. I told my mom and she called the police for the first time. They said there was nothing they could do and told me to stay inside from now on.

He scared me so much that I moved across the state to live with my dad for a year. I decided to go to high school at my mom's, so I came back. It was December of my freshman year when things started to get worse. The first thing that happened was that I found a letter in my mailbox with a card and a handwritten note. The note said ""I'm so sorry raisethishand, I love you."" The card was a generic card you would get someone you loved. It went into detail about how he longed to kiss me and hold me in his arms, even though he knew we couldn't be together. I alerted the police again. This time they told me that he seemed a little off, but in Pennsylvania there's no such thing as a restraining order. We have Protections from Abuse, and they're only valid for a lover or a family member. The police officer said to my mom, right in front of me, ""It would have been better if she had been raped. We could do something about it then.""

My family moved that night, and all was peaceful for a few weeks. Then, my new house started getting hang up calls from different gas station payphones. They were varied but I ended up getting about 50 calls in a month and a half. The last of these calls were from a gas station one block away from my house. That was the last straw, my mom and stepdad followed him back to my original town, on the phone with the police the entire way.
When they reached his house, the police were waiting. They checked his truck and found binoculars, rope, duct tape, and a list of my family member's addresses and phone numbers. He was taken to jail.
During the court proceedings I was too afraid to face him, and he was sentenced to 2 years of probation for stalking. I was fourteen, he was fifty three.

It's been six years now, but every time I have to go back to that town I get panic attacks. I still have nightmares about the thin man with the cowboy hat coming to take me away."	t5_2t3t8	True
1347475044.0	zs1ab	The nearest motel? (update)	KeepInKitchen	192	42	42	"I never thought I'd ever say this, but:

Thank you neighbors that should just get a divorce! Your early morning screaming saved me! 

I guess I'll start this update at the end of the post, so some of this stuff will be in the comments.

Last night my parents left on an overnight trip for a wedding, leaving me and my younger brother behind to hold down the fort. That should have been an easy task, I mean a 21 year old and an 18 year old should be able to survive one night without burning the house down or encountering deranged meth addicts. 

I first noticed the truck pull up around 10pm. He may have been there earlier, but I wouldn't have known. I showed my brother and he just laughed at me. ""You are turning into Mom. It's just a truck, Bean, and just a tweaker. He's probably at that dealer around the corner.""  

I decided he was right, but just to be safe I got out an old baseball bat. That thing stayed in my hand or on my lap all night. I got through two episodes of adventure time before my dogs started freaking out. I ran to the window to check if the truck was still there, and sure enough it was. And so was Mr. Motel. 

I nearly had a heart attack when I saw him. He was leaning against the driver's door of his pick up, smoking a cigarette and just staring. My heart started beating out of my chest, I dropped the curtain and flung myself against the wall. 

Did he see me? 
How does he smoke while keeping up that giant grin? 
Why won't he leave? 
Where's my brother's shot gun?

I took my stairs two at a time, racing to my brother's bedroom. ""Blake? Blake wake up!"" I started shaking my brother awake. Downstairs I heard my dogs growling again, ""Blake! Where's your shot gun?"" That got his attention. 

""Oh my god Allissa! Are you really that freaked out?"" I felt kinda bad, because he looked so worried for me. 

""Better safe than sorry, right?"" I tried to look a bit less panicked by adding a little shrug. 

He sighed and reached under his bed. He handed me his gun case went through a quick gun safety check list. We both do this any time a gun is around, just saying it out loud eased my frazzled nerves. At least it did until my dogs went crazy again.

Let me clarify something right now. Whenever I read these things and people talk about how they brought their dogs with them, how their dogs protected them, or how they felt so much safer with the dog in the room, I know they don't have MY dogs. I have 3 chihuahuas. One is a coward, one is so spastic that if you even say the word treat he has an asthma attack, and one is fifteen years old and would lose his teeth if he tried to bite the ankle of an intruder. Their only security purpose is an early alarm system.

So my mini stooges start barking and growling and running in and out of the doggy door. 'It's just a cat, it's just a cat, maybe some birds, but probably a cat...' was my mantra, until about midnight. I couldn't stop thinking about the truck outside, so I started writing the pervious post. 

At around 3:30am I decided to peek out my window to check on the truck, just like I thought, it was still there. My cheerful friend was not.

I decided that I was being paranoid. I'm sitting on the couch with a baseball bat in one hand, 911 keyed up on my brother's phone in my lap, Reddit in my other hand, and a gun within reach. Yeah, it's time to lay off the scary stories. ""He's just at a friend's house. People make friends all the time. Just go to bed and forget about all this.""

Around 4:30 my next door neighbors start fighting. They do this from time to time. And by ""time to time"", I mean ""pretty much every waking moment they're together and not having sex."" this time it's a bit more violent. I can hear glass shattering and threats of murder or breaking up. Someone must have called the cops, because thirty minutes later a patrol car rolls up the street. 

It could not have been better timed. The alarm chimed in my house, letting me know that a window had opened. I grabbed the bat that was by my side and waited the 45 seconds before I knew my alarm would start blaring.

It was the longest 45 seconds of my life. 

I heard some crashes, some scrambling towards the window that had opened, and a clearly spoken ""Well that's inconvenient"", mixing in with the shrieking of our alarm. I jumped out of bed once I thought he'd left and ran to my brother's room again. He was awake, and no longer laughing at.

""Stat here Blake. I swear, if you leave this room I will break your Xbox."" and back into the hall I went. I didn't turn off the alarm, hoping to get more attention from the red and blue lights I could see from my window. 

Suddenly I hear a ""Hey! Where the hell did you come from? Stop!"" I ran outside, bat in hand, just in time to see a Man in Tan (our county's version of a boy in blue) chasing down a speed blonde buzz cut. 

He caught him, cuffed him, and questioned me. The whole time I was talking to the officer Mr. Motel was staring at me, still smiling. I'm getting goosebumps just thinking about it. 

I guess he had some paraphernalia on him as well as the b&amp;e, and a prior record of assault. Thanks to these incredibly stubborn and volatile people next door I am not harmed and my tweaker creeper is gone."	t5_2t3t8	True
1346095192.0	yx2df	My canine protectors.	Tilas	177	25	19	"This one happened when I was younger, about oh....15 or so. Back then, we owned 3 dogs. two little mutts, and one great big Saint Bernard. The little dogs always got to sleep in the house, while the big Saint (named Bear), preferred to stay outside in the back pen where it's cooler. One night, probably around 2am, I'm home alone, and woken up to Bear barking. He barks a lot, so at first, I thought nothing of it... until I realized his bark was different. It wasn't the normal ""woof woof I'm here look at the world"" type bark. This was a deep, low, guttural snarling ""I want to kill something"" bark. I sit up and listen, and outside my bedroom window I can hear footsteps pacing back and forth, a moment later someone at the front door jiggling the knob. Now the two little dogs are angry, and they start to growl too. Since the back door of the house leads right into Bears pen, I quickly go and open it, letting him in the house (and just as quickly slamming it back closed and locking it!). He charges in, and races around the house, checking every room. He then comes back to me and ""herds"" me into my room by using his large body to push me back into my bedroom. He would not let me go anywhere else. Once I climb back onto the bed, my two little dogs hope onto the bed, one at the head, one at the foot. Bear then sits at the doorway and blocks the door, facing outwards and growling. They stayed like that for the rest of the night.
There's no doubt in my mind they kept me safe that night. Whoever was out there was obviously someone they didn't like, and they knew to protect me. I had never (and never again) saw him ever get as angry as he was that night.  I shudder to imagine what would have happened if they (especially Bear) weren't there."	t5_2t3t8	True
1337376709.0	ttuwc	I hate the area I live in.	WeAreTheStorm	173	25	40	"I live right across the border of Mexico--the Rio Grande River. There's a lot of crime in my area, and I live in a neighborhood that consists of low-income households. This happened while I was asleep in my room at around 1:30 pm. My mom had just went to work, and my dad was at work as well. It was just me (I'm 23) and my two sisters home alone (they are 17 and 20 years old). My dad tells us to never open the door to anyone while we are home alone. My sisters were watching TV in the living room as a car parked in the driveway outside our house, and someone started knocking at the door. My sisters didn't answer. The person began to knock louder, yell, and then started banging on the front door. My sisters were pretty freaked out so the younger one (Nellie) grabbed a bat and they both went inside my parents bedroom. The people outside then proceeded to bang on windows around the house and kept yelling, ""Hey!!!"" 

My sisters heard someone breaking in through the front window in the dining room that faces the driveway. The guys made it inside the house, and my sisters heard footsteps that went into Nellie's bedroom right near my parents bedroom. My cats hid right away. Nellie stood behind the closed bedroom door holding a bat while Gina called 911 in the closet. Nellie hears the guy opening her dresser in her room, trying to find stuff to steal. She then hears him walk out of her bedroom towards the room they were currently in. The bedroom door opens and reveals a guy with his arms full of shit he stole from Nellie's room. It was Nellie's cheap jewelry box that contained some cheap fantasy jewelry. They locked eyes and he was standing about 2 feet away from Nellie. He was a blonde guy around 18-25 years old. The guy looked as shocked to see my sister as she was. He exclaimed, ""Oh shit, they're home!"" He ran out of my house through the window and took off. Thankfully they weren't armed when they broke in. My sisters proceeded to go into my room to wake me up and found out someone had went into Gina's bedroom as well because her cabinets were open and a broken DS was missing. That's how we know that two guys came into the house. The cops came and they filed a report. 

So it turns out they were part of a burglary ring and broke into 7 other houses as well. They caught the guys already. Now my dad barracades the door with a homemade bolt, a sofa, and he barracades the front window with a huge drawer. He also made rigged a string across the garage that sets off a loud alarm if someone walks through it.

About 2 weeks later at night, I'm walking by the dining room window, and I hear a guy's voice outside. My dog is also barking. I peak out the window and there's this guy standing behind my car in the darkness (my neighborhood is poorly lit) and waving at me. It freaked me out because his arm just moved robotically back and forth, waving. I called my dad and he peaked out the window, but no one was there. He went to get his shotgun anyway, and I looked out the window again. The guy had actually ducked down while my dad had looked, and he stood up to proceed to wave at me. My dad opens the front door with the gun and asks the guy what he wants. The guy told him to ""come here"" where he was behind our car. He said he wanted my dad to sell something for him (my dad owns a small business). My dad told him to get the fuck out and the guy threatened him and walked off, cussing at my dad. We're moving out of the neighborhood soon."	t5_2t3t8	True
1337318555.0	tsvn6	The Caravan Park 	colacube	174	25	14	"This happened quite a few years ago. I studied art at university and particularly enjoyed landscape painting. One year my tutor warned me I was lagging behind and encouraged me to catch up over the winter holiday. My dad owned a caravan in the countryside so I asked if I could stay there for a few days and do some watercolour studies. The caravan park is closed in the winter, but my dad knew the owner and called ahead to ask his permission.

My dad dropped me off as I couldn't drive. He said he'd return in a few days. The caravan park was deserted and the nearest building or town (were the park-owner lived) was a few miles away.

In the daytime I'd paint like crazy, in the evening I'd cook and watch TV in the caravan. It was nice being completely alone for a few days. Until one night...

It was 2am and I was cooking salmon steaks (being a teenager I kept odd hours). I sat and watched TV as they grilled. Suddenly there was a knock at the door. My heart skipped a beat and I sat there paralysed. There was no good reason for anyone to be outside my caravan at 2am. I waited for a few minutes and heard nothing. I looked through the window, but it was pitch black outside. I thought maybe I imagined it, I tried to remain calm and then... another knock at the door. I grabbed a knife, flung open the door and leapt outside. Something whizzed around the caravan and I gave chase, but found nothing.

I returned to the caravan shaking with adrenaline. I sat down and for the third time heard a knock at the door. looking towards the door I noticed the handle to the venetian blind was shaking. I realised that every time I sat down the caravan shook and caused the handle to bang against the door. I felt like an idiot.

1330528483.0	qbdbo	He approached my boy[Fr]iend and said he just wanted to borrow his cell phone...	hippiemachine	174	26	15	"It happened December 23rd of last year. My boyfriend lived in a condo complex in the East End of Richmond, Va in an area that's generally pretty nice and quiet ([Here's the Google Maps of the area so you can get an idea of it condo layout. He lived in one of the units facing Richmond Road.](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=richmond+va+richmond+road&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wl)). 

It was the afternoon and my boyfriend had gotten off of work a bit earlier than usual, so he was just milling about at home when he decided to go outside and check his mail. The units' mailboxes were a block away from where he lived, so he had to walk through the complex to get there. His journey was interrupted by a man who looked lost. The man said his name was Jamal and that he was looking for his cousin, then asked if my boyfriend knew which unit his cousin lived in. Jamal seemed a bit off, but appeared to be harmless enough. 

Of course my boyfriend had no idea who Jamal's cousin was or where he lived (It's a pretty big complex), so he told him as much. Jamal then asked to borrow my boyfriend's iPhone to call his cousin, which he declined since it was completely possible that this guy would just run off with it. Jamal then asked that my boyfriend call his cousin, and he complied. He ended up getting in contact with the cousin, who promised to pick up Jamal in a few hours when he got off of work. Jamal then thanked him and wandered off, and my boyfriend thought nothing more of the encounter.

Later that day, we went off to Lynchburg, Va. to celebrate the Christmas weekend and had no internet access the entire time. When we got back on Monday, the local news websites were buzzing about a double murder and child abduction on Christmas Eve. The story especially piqued my interest since it happened only a couple of blocks from where my boyfriend lived, so I told him about it and showed him a picture of the suspect. He went silent, and then stared off into space. Concerned, I asked him what was wrong.

He said he recognized that man; it was Jamal and that the very next day after their encounter, that guy had murdered two people in a drug-related robbery attempt, then fled the scene in an SUV that had a child in the back of it. Over the next couple of days, we learned that Jamal had just been released from prison the day my boyfriend found him wandering around the condo complex, had a long criminal rap sheet, and had gone to his victims' house Christmas Eve in search for [drug money, but ended up killing them instead](http://www.wtvr.com/news/wtvr-neighbors-friends-shed-light-on-church-hill-murder-victims-20111225,0,3009554.story). 

A few days later, the police found the missing child safe and sound in the SUV, abandoned in a cemetery literally down the street from my boyfriend's condo. I pressed him to call the Crimestoppers hotline and give them a tip about Jamal's cousin, but that turned out to be unnecessary as Jamal eventually turned himself in after several days of being on the run.

1372075355.0	1gypms	Food giveaway	sfgiants48	163	19	12	"Let me start off by saying, I live in a small, fairly safe city in California. When I was 13, I used to help out with my mom at a church food giveaway every Friday after school.

The food giveaways generally catered to around 70-100 people depending on how many signed up that Friday. For the most part the people were fairly decent. Just people down on their luck needing some help. Every once in awhile you would get some rift raft. 

The food giveaways went in the same order. The people would all lineup and signup. During the signup, people would give their name, kinds of foods they did or didn't need, size of family, etc. After the signup they would let people into the room and give a 20-30 minute optional sermon to listen to, as all of us volunteers would pack their food. Then, after the sermon, we would call out their names one by one and pass out their bags. 

One Friday, while helping, we had the usual crowd. I'm not particularly sure why but my mom and I finished packing bags early that day, so we decided to sit and listen to the rest of the sermon with everybody else. Now, this room is fairly packed on seating, so they had a couple of benches lined against the wall, facing sideways toward the crowd.

While listening, I noticed a man sitting on one of the benches. I never saw him before, so he definitely had to be new. Anyway, while listening I noticed he had been staring directly at me a lot. It gave me the creeps, but I tried my best to ignore him. At one point I looked at him and he made his fingers into a v shape and put it up to his mouth and began moving his tongue in and out and moving it in circles. I had no idea what it meant and was really confused. I elbowed my mom to get her to look at him and when she looked over he abruptly stopped. This went on through the rest of the sermon. 

He gave me the creeps, so while passing out bags I stayed near my mom. He kept hovering near me and it was getting really strange. At one point he pretended to bump into me and spilled soda all over my top. He ran to get napkins and began to try and touch my barely developed boobs, to wipe up his mess. At this point I knew he was a weirdo, but 13 year old me didn't want to make a scene and tell my mom. I just walked to the volunteers hidden bathroom and sat in there the rest of the time.

I told my mom about everything on the car ride home, and she flipped out. The next week she told everyone about what happened at the church and gave them my description of him and would kick him out the next time he came around.  

I wish I could say this is the end of my story, but it's not. He started stalking me. After school he would be waiting by some trees and watching as I got on the bus to go home, but he never approached me. He even started showing up to my softball practices. We called the cops and filed a report. Turns out, the description I gave them matched a local sex offender. Even though he was stalking me, the police said they couldn't do anything because I didn't have any proof.

He continued to stalk me. One particular day though, I stayed after school for a club meeting. After the meeting I stayed even longer to help cleanup. After cleaning up, my club leader was going to give me a ride home. My club leader gave me the keys to his car and told me to meet him outside near it. He just had to make one phone call and he would be right out. I went on my way not even thinking that he could be outside waiting for me. After I got outside I saw him standing in his usual place by the trees. I was going to go back inside but the school doors automatically locked. I was just standing there hoping he didn't approach. I decided my safest bet would be to go to his car, but as I was walking toward his car, as casually as I could, he ran up and started cursing at me. He started telling me how much of a bitch I was and telling me all he wanted was for us to be friends. Luckily my club leader made it outside and yelled toward him to get away from me. 
After that he took off running.

I told my mom and we filed another report but nothing ever came of it. I never saw him again after that day, and hope I never do.

1371182149.0	1gbfq3	Terrorist caught me having sex and wouldn't leave	Nettles4Porcupines	203	55	16	"It was about six months after 9/11. As my boyfriend and I were both high school students at the time we were always looking for places to have sex. One Friday night after our usual dinner and a movie date we went back to his mom's place to see if she was asleep (we often sneaked in after she was asleep to have sex in his bedroom). Unfortunately the lights were still on. We consoled ourselves by making out vigorously in the courtyard.

At this point my boyfriend got a bright idea. The apartment complex was gated and only had 4 apartments in it. There was a storage room for all the tenants to use and he thought it was extremely unlikely that anyone would go in it late at night. We spent several minutes discussing this possibility in the courtyard. The entrance to the storage room was directly from the courtyard and all the apartments looked out over the courtyard.

We went into the storage room and started doing our thing. I was straddling him while he sat on a back seat from a minivan. Suddenly I look up and see this middle aged white guy in a cowboy hat staring at us. He had come in silently. I screamed and my boyfriend looked behind him. The man just kept staring but didn't say anything. My boyfriend stammered, ""John, what are you doing here?"" John chuckled softly and said, ""There's an entrance to my apartment through here."" We scrambled to get dressed while he continued to silently stare at us. My boyfriend apologized profusely and asked him not to tell his mom and he said, ""Sure thing, buddy. You two can come in here whenever you want."" We hightailed it out of there. John followed us into the courtyard, but not past the gates of the complex.

My boyfriend said, ""That was so weird, why wouldn't he just use his front door?"" ""Why did he keep staring at us and not let us get dressed in privacy?"" I practically shouted. I had moved on from shock and embarrassment to anger. We concluded he had seen us heading to the storage room and had purposely sneaked in behind us to watch.

A few weeks later John made the local papers for an extremely amateurish attempt at hijacking a plane using piano wire. We aren't sure what happened to him, but he was never seen at his apartment again and eventually his girlfriend came and moved all his stuff out.

1365705903.0	1c5h2l	The Toy Section	underdogkitten	181	34	23	"When my siblings and I were younger, my mother had a habit that was totally acceptable when she was growing up. When she had to do errands at Wal-Mart or any other big store, she would take us to the toy section and tell us she'd come back when she'd found everything she was looking for. Sometimes she'd even let us pick a toy (nothing too expensive, mind you) and she would buy it with the other purchases.

Now this sometimes led to problems, particularly if an employee saw my mother ""abandoning"" me there or if she was taking a really long time to come back for me. I remember once Wal-Mart was starting to close and the lights were being shut off and I was still waiting for my mother.

An employee found me holding back tears and clutching onto a teddy bear. He led to me to the check out and they called my mother on the speakers like they would do for a lost child. Turns out she'd gone into another store in the mall and had gotten locked out when the mall closed.

That was a week or two before the story I'm about to tell you. Needless to say, I was a bit...clingy to say the least. I didn't want to be left alone but my mother could get the shopping done quicker without me tagging along and my brother was refusing to babysit me at home. She promised me a toy and maybe some chocolate if I would just wait patiently in the toy section like a good girl.

Well, I'm the kind of person who is desperate for approval so even though I didn't like the idea, I ran off to the toy section. She didn't even walk me there anymore. We just had to get past the greeter and then we went separate ways.

I found the toy section and was admiring the barbie doll collection. I was trying to figure out which one I wanted. I knew I couldn't get a really expensive one but maybe I could plead and get one with a few additional accessories. I mean, I knew she felt bad about what happened last time. I finally decided that I would ask for the barbie doll that had little jewels on her dress that contained makeup you could apply to the dolls face. I saw it at a friend's house and was kind of envious.

Having made my choice, I looked around happily and trying to figure out what to look at next when I saw something...odd. It was a grown man by himself. Now that wasn't the odd part. The thing that made me feel odd was that he kept looking at me. It made me uncomfortable and I didn't know why. He didn't look scary but something about his smile. I just, I just knew that something wasn't right.

I quickly left the aisle and found another toy to distract myself with. I found some bouncy balls and bounced them against the ground. I was having fun but I quickly noticed the man from before in the aisle again. Was he...following me? I put the ball back and changed aisles.

I couldn't even focus on what toys were on the shelf. I just wanted to get away from this man. Why wasn't he leaving me alone? He came into the aisle within a minute or two. If I knew where my mom was, I would have run to her in a heartbeat. I couldn't even see an employee to ask for help.

But I did see a mother with two boys and a stroller. They weren't in the toy section, but they were walking past it. I'd been told many times to not leave the section without mom but I needed to get away from this man. I ran off to the lady and walked beside her. I almost tried holding her hand. She gave me an odd look and I quickly looked at the man who was following me. I could see him and when the lady looked where I was looking, he quickly walked away from the toy section. 

I followed them for a bit and then walked to a section near the toys. I ended up hiding in a clothes rack, peeking through some shirts to see when my mom would come back. When she came back, I hugged her tight. She asked me why I was running from another section and I couldn't figure out how to explain what had happened. She scolded me and told me I was to stay put next time. I used to have nightmares about that strange man and what could have happened if I'd have stayed put. Even though she didn't like me leaving the toys, I get the feeling I would have ended up in a lot more trouble if I'd have just been a good girl."	t5_2t3t8	True
1359072570.0	1781v9	Sometimes one guy can make a huge difference... 	My_Fake_Account_03	165	18	35	"17 female

This happened to me yesterday, and still weirds me out. 

Some background information.... I'm a senior in highschool. My school is rather big and has about 5,000 or so kids in it. So of course there are people you will run into that you have never seen before and might never see again. I have a boyfriend, who I've been dating for 18 months now. He is really protective of me, and worries about me as I seem to be a ""creep magnet"" as he calls it. I have off periods everyday in the afternoon so I can leave and go home at 2:30 instead of 4, like he does. 

Yesterday after my classes, I didn't go straight to the parking lot and home. I had a meeting with my teacher and ended up leaving around 3:15 or so instead of 2:30. Almost everyone was either gone by now, or in class. I grabbed my purse and headed over towards the parking lot to go home. 

I was looking down at my phone, not paying much attention to my surroundings (which was dumb, I know) and as I was about 25 feet away from my car I hear this low whistle and realize that someone is whistling at me. I glance over my shoulder and see two guys standing there. 

These guys, were very stereotypical douchebag looking guys. Low sagging pants, tshirts, boxers, sneakers, flat bill hats, and one had a greasy ponytail. Figuring that boys will be boys, I moved on, and ignored them. Which only made them angry. 

""Hey bitch, don't walk away from me"" I turned around and realized they had to be talking to me, as no one else was around. They were a few steps away from me now, and one reached out and tried to grab my hand. I jerked away and told them to leave me alone. 

To let everyone know, yesterday I was wearing a small cropped jean jacket over a tank top and a cute white skirt. 

I was then grabbed very meanly and the one with the ponytail pinched my chin and told me he didn't like when his girls talked to him that way. He then proceeded to look me over, all while holding my face and hands still. 

 ""I think I would've remembered you if I had seen you before. What grade are you in sweatheart, why haven't we meet?"" 

I, of course, let him know exactly how awful he was, and how I was none of his business, and where I thought he should go. Which just got me slapped. He asked if I had a boyfriend and where he was, and why wasn't he here to protect me.

While the guy with the ponytail questioned me, the other guy was stroking my hair or my arms. He was squeezing my thighs, and making comments about my ass and my skirt and how we should all go somewhere a little more private. 

I wanted to cry. I was at school. This is not something that should be happening. I was so close to my car. My jacket was around my elbows, these guy with a ponytail and greasy hands had my face trapped in his hand and my wrists locked in one of his hands. I didn't know what I was going to do. 

That's when I hear a ""what the fuck is going on?!"" It was a principal from the middle school down the road, he had driven up to our highschool for a meeting. In fact, he was my old principal from the middle school I went too. They turned around, shouting a few obscene words, called me a few names, and ran. 

That's when I burst into tears. My old principal came over and held me, then walked me into the office. Where I sat down and told them everything that happened. The police were called. I went through the story again, and described the two guys the best I could to everyone. 

They weren't at school today as far as I know. They were expelled, and charged with sexual harassment of a minor (both were over 18) and I've also got a restraining order on both. 

My parents came and picked me up from school so I didn't have to drive. My boyfriend was livid, I was scared. It was truly a terrifying experience.

 If that principal hadnt showed up, I'm pretty sure I know what would have happened. I don't even want to think about it. I have bruises on my neck and around my wrists from where he was holding me, and I've got small marks on my arms and legs from the other guy squeezing and pinching and other crude things as he went farther up my legs towards my skirt, and farther along my arms and collarbone towards the collar of my shirt. 

He had already pushed my skirt up so you could see my underwear, but he hadn't gone so far as to touch me there or on my chest. Yet. 

I am just so grateful for that man. I've written him a letter and baked him cookies that I will deliver but words and treats in no way even come close to describing my gratitude towards him. Thanks for listening, I guess I wanted to tell someone who wasn't involved in anyway."	t5_2t3t8	True
1346533333.0	z77uj	Did this peeping tom intent to escalate?	squaredpurple	184	32	39	"   I found myself living alone at the age of 19 after kicking out my lazy boyfriend for not getting a job/not helping with housework/drinking and smoking all day. I wasn't very fearful about the solitude, as I worked late and would ride the bus home from work for hours alone to show up to an empty apartment anyways and had always managed to escape potentially creepy situations through common sense and possession of pepper spray and a cell phone. My neighborhood was a bit shitty, about two miles from the Las Vegas strip, so the streets were always occupied by all different types of people at all hours of the night and day, so I wasn't too worried about people jumping at me from the shadows with so many witnesses around. I was actually looking forward to the privacy and freedom living alone would bring. 

   For weeks, I went about my business, going to work in the early afternoon and returning late at night, usually around 1am, always careful to watch my surroundings and making sure I wasn't being followed. My one-bedroom apartment was located in a building at the edge of the complex, about 25 feet from the last building of the complex, which was undergoing remodeling. I thought such a place may be privy to squatters, so would be wary and scan that area before walking to my door. 

  One night, not long after I'd gotten home, my doorknob began to jiggle. I immediately assumed it was my ex, who would know what time I'd be home and would sometimes show up to try and reconcile. I didn't walk to the door, but rather texted him and asked if he was at the door. He quickly replied that he wasn't, and that I should call the police. By then, the knob had stopped moving and I gathered the courage to walk to the window, 911 dialed into my phone and pepper spray in the other hand. I didn't see anything and assumed that it was probably a confused drunk and decided to shake it off. I installed a chain lock on my door the very next day, just in case.

  Nothing obviously out of the ordinary occurred until weeks later, when a new guy I had been seeing and myself were watching Buffy in my bed very late at night and something (probably the chilling excitement of the show) possessed me to peek out my bedroom window. From this window, I could see my front door about 10 feet away, and directly in front of it was a dark figure hunched up, seemingly staring down at the doorknob. I gasped and looked on in a confused shock for a few seconds before getting away from the window and telling this new boyfriend of mine that there was someone standing at the door. He assumed I was playing a prank on him and didn't get up to check without a minute of incessant prodding. By the time he'd gotten up, the figure was gone and we again assumed it was a silly drunk. 

   Nights later, we were having sex by the glow of the tv in my bedroom when one of my cats jumped from the windowsill, loudly parting those vertical vinyl apartment blinds and exposing a dark figure directly in front of my window. I froze and whispered to my boyfriend that someone was at the window, and he froze as well. We turned off the tv so the person could no longer see inside, and witnessed a shadow walking away by the contrast of the outside lights visible through the tiny gaps between the blinds. 

   The next day, a neighbor of mine came by and warned that she had seen a peeping tom at her window the night before as well. So I just assumed that this person was a somewhat harmless pervert and decided to get myself a dog to ward him off. I found myself a young great dane/black lab mix with a deep bark and would walk him around the perimeter every night with my pepper spray and flashlight to make sure no one was creeping around. I'd throw the blinds open in a violent fashion anytime I felt someone was about to stop in front of my window, staring at people in a knowing way, probably terrifying many passers-by. Idiot that I am, I'd sometimes even climb the tree in front of my apartment and keep watch in the dark during the times he would come around, just to catch him the act and get a good description for the police. 

   Some days went by without any action and I found myself walking home from the bus stop at 1 am as usual. I could see my building through the gate on the street I was walking on and my heart stopped when I saw that dark figure hunched in front of my door again (I was at probably 100 feet distance). I had to go around a corner onto the street up ahead in order to enter the complex, so I ran up there with 911 dialed and ready to call, finger on the pepper spray button. Once I reached my building, I tiptoed around the corner, heart pounding, ready to spray, to find no one at my door and no one around. I knew someone had been there for sure, because my 3 cats were all at the window next to the door already, and they would do that whenever they heard someone at the door. I entered my apartment and the dog seemed to be excited, as well. 

   Later that night, I was in bedroom in the dark and heard someone staggering by on the sidewalk next to my window, and suddenly an incredibly loud pound on the window as someone threw their body into it. ""This is it"", I thought, ""He's going to try to get me."" The window did not break and I heard a loud ""Sorry!"" as I saw a shadow stagger away and found myself suddenly ducked on the floor, phone in hand, dog barking away. I felt dumb for mistaking a clumsy drunk for the perpetrator this time and was skeptical with further incidents.

   Things stayed quiet for a while again, and I had my boyfriend over another night. At about 3am, I decided to run to the gas station down the street and walk my dog while boyfriend slept. I returned 20 minutes later, entered my bedroom, and layed down next to him, back to watching tv. Not 2 minutes later, there was a shadow at the window, very close, hunching over to look inside. My boyfriend was awake at this point and saw it, too. We looked on in shock for a minute and then boyfriend shouted, ""WHAT IT DOOOOO!!!"" and the shadow ran off. The next morning, there was a big slash in the canvas covering to boyfriend's convertible.

  It scared me that I had just been outside with this person and that they must have seen me out there to come to my window right after, and I had not seen them. It occurred to me that this had to be a neighbor and that I must pass their apartment every time I come home, so I started taking a different route every night, and trying to make my return times more erratic to throw him off. The sound of my cats jumping to and from the window sill would wake me up all through the nights. I became paranoid and hyper-aware of every sound in the night, every person walking past my door. I sort of got the sense that I might be overreacting if I called the police, assumed there was nothing they could do if I called them, and didn't want to show my fear by having them come by. I began to stay at my boyfriend's house some nights when I felt I couldn't handle the tension, but had to return often to care for my cats and dog and pick up belongings. I so terribly wanted to stay home with my pets and to live life without that paranoia of someone watching me, and I would try to go about life normally most days. Sometimes I'd see the shadow at the window or hear tapping as I was drifting in and out of sleep, find piles of rocks in front of my door and even a dead bird, but most days I just became numb to the fear and convinced myself these were isolated incidents, and assuming that if they were dangerous, they would have done something already. 

  Things remained mild for a while, then I found myself staying at the hospital for a week, as my boyfriend had been hospitalized due to pancreatitis. I would send family to my apartment to care for my pets during the day. I finally returned home after his surgery and had pretty much gotten this peeping tom out of my mind, not even looking for anything unusual at this point. The next day would be my first day returning to work since attending to my boyfriend and I was coming in earlier than usual. When I came in, my coworkers were surprised to see me and asked why I had decided to come in. Apparently, a male voice had called earlier, providing my first and last name and saying that I wouldn't be making it into work that day, supplying no explanation and hanging up. A close friend of mine had been the one to answer the phone and told me how she found it unusual since she didn't recognize the voice as my boyfriend's or my brother's, the only two males I could fathom ever calling with my name. I called them just in case, and they said they hadn't called in to work for me and had no reason to. 

  I never did find out who called or why, but I didn't return home from work that night, sort of fearing that someone would be waiting for me. I stayed at my boyfriend's most of the time the next few weeks until my lease was up and high-tailed it out of that apartment. Looking back, I really should have just called the police to get these incidents on record and to show that I was aware that he was out there. I wonder how many times he had seen me through the gaps in those annoying vertical blinds without my being aware, walking around naked, sleeping, enjoying false privacy, and it just feels disgusting. Was he stealing my mail? Keeping track of my work schedule? Plotting something weird? There were just too many weird happenings for them all to be isolated incidents. Maybe I've read too many creepy anecdotes and serial killer biographies, but I do feel as if I could have been in danger and was a pretty good target for a first victim of some demented creep in the infancy of his perverted career.

1340386612.0	vg0fi	Old foamy, a legend? I THINK NOT!	kolbsterjr	199	48	40	"Wow, this is a long one guys, but I need to share this, it was a pretty scary moment and I think it will go great with this sub reddit.

A fun fall day turns to night, what do we do now?

Now, me and my friends live in this extremely boring little town that really on all occasions there's nothing to do at any time ever. All we have is this little P.O.S. theater and a run down skating rink for ""fun"". Everyone in our town has heard of the legend of Old Foamy and we decided we'll look more into it.

Pretty much the whole jist of things is to park on this fairly thin bridge called old foamy in the middle of the night, shut off your car, then honk three times. Many bodies have in fact been found dismangled and torn or murdered around the area, so that just fueld the fire. Oh ya, the windows should be rolled down too. Piece of cake right? WRONG.

After doing said ""Ritual"" the beast labeled ""Old Foamy""(The name the beast received from the bridge witch make the water foam up when water rolls through it) is suppost to appear, smash on top of your car or throw dead animals at you. Hence the sign of him before he comes is car not starting. 

So me and four others pile into my little car and we head off. We arrive there thinking no goat man would ever appear. Stopped, put the car into park, rolled them windows down, and honked three times.

Then, silence, no insects churping nor wind nor footsteps. (It was fall by the way, we'd hear stuff going down.) While waiting we hear a crunch in the leaves to our left, I put my hand on the key preparing to start the car(just in case). Then we hear rustling to the right. While being completely distracted we look up and I happen to catch a glance in the rearview a figure, a person, but in the most fucked up mask i've ever seen. Not that it was gory, but a fucking cow skull. 

Instentaniously I try and start the car, to my luck warning lights come on and it starts beeping. My power windows wouldnt even work. As well as screaming many vulgarities and trying to get my car started little did I notice the figure moved closer. So close, i bet he could touch the back of my car. Whilst hearing more wrestling in the woods and everyone in the car completely flipping all kinds of I get the car to start, put it in drive and get the hell out of there, but as were pulling away, there were more to the sides of us, 3 on the left that I saw and Chris said he saw 2 more on the right. All with hoods except Mr. Cow skull behind. All staring and waiting as we hauled out of there.

Later did we know that there was more behind that place then a 7 foot goat man. Apperently, the area is known for satanic rituals and other cult like actions to occur. If we would've know that, I would've never thought to come there. 

That was truly the scariest moment of my life, and I will never, ever do that again. Glad they didn't screw us over....

1370119034.0	1fhcft	The Manager [Long]	allehcat	182	35	39	"When I was in high school, I got my first job. My dad hooked it up so that I'd be able to work at one of his friend's restaurants. He was buddies with the manager too, so I didn't even need an interview. I was totally stoked. Landing a job at 16 with no interview is an introvert's dream. 

As I got used to the atmosphere of the restaurant/bar, I couldn't get comfortable with my coworkers. One thing that really bothered me was the air of sexual harassment. When 'messing around', my tits would get groped a lot as a joke. It was mostly just my female coworkers, and I'm not an asshole so I tried to laugh and be friendly. But one of my male coworkers gave me the creeps, and it just so happened that he was now my manager. I don't know why he gave me that vibe, but he definitely did. 

The first time I ever closed by myself, he came up behind me while I was stocking the walk-in, and pinned me to the counter. I could feel his....man parts, and I was totally freaked out. He was trying to sweet talk me, and I was having none of this shit. I told him I had a boyfriend, I was only 16, anything I could think of that would deter him. He was like, 'don't worry, i won't tell your daddy.' It was so intensely creepy. 

I managed to finish my side work and leave, but I was super creeped out by him. I texted my boyfriend [who also worked at our restaurant] and told him what had happened, and he promised to not let me close alone anymore. He said he'd stay and wait for me from now on.

I felt a lot better, so [stupidly] I didn't report him to our boss or anything. I mean, this guy is a friend of my dad's, and has kids and stuff. I wasn't trying to get him fired. Work progresses as usual for a few weeks, and then one night when I leave work, I notice a car following me. I notice because it's fucking 4am, and there are NO other cars on the road. I am immediately creeped out when the car doesn't turn off and keeps tailing me for a good 10 minutes. I decide not to drive home, and turn off the freeway into a maze of dirt roads. I figure I'll park in an orange grove for 10 minutes and then drive home like a bat out of hell when I shake this guy. I was terrified out of my mind because I watch too many scary movies, so I had already called my mom and boyfriend freaking out. They told me that I should drive straight to the police station, and that he'd stop following. So I pulled out of the trees, and there was the fucking car! I could see the driver's silhouette, but that was it.

I drove to the station, and the car continued to follow me. Even when I got there, it stayed across the street, parked in an empty lot. I ran inside, all shaky and a mess. I told the front desk officer what happened, and she went to the window and saw that the car was still there. Another officer went out to talk to the driver, and to tell them to leave me the fuck alone. 

When he came back, he told me it was my Manager, Miguel, from work. He was just following me to make sure I got home safely. I couldn't fucking believe it. I told them something wasn't right, and he gave me the absolute creeps. I was told to report any more sexual harassment, but that they couldn't do much. I got a police escort home, to make sure he wouldn't follow any more. Now I knew that he drove a silver Ford Explorer, and you bet I'd be on the lookout.

I started to see his car drive past my house multiple times a day. If I was on the computer by the window, I'd see him maybe 10 times. I told my parents, but they were convinced that he wouldn't do that, I was paranoid, I was shaken up after what had happened. But I knew it was him.

One night, my boyfriend couldn't wait for me at work when I was closing. I don't remember why [this was like 5 years ago]. He had to go, and I was immensely freaked out. My manager kept making comments about how we 'were finally alone' and how it was 'too bad that I was under 18' because 'there were so many things I'd be good at'. CREEP FUCKIN CITY. The night climaxed with him actually forcing himself on me. I drove straight from work to the police station for a rape kit.

The good news, however, is that this guy is actually behind bars now. It was THAT serious. I ended up being weirdly traumatized afterwards. I get super weird when a car follows me for more than a minute. I realize that I should have been reporting this guy from the very beginning."	t5_2t3t8	True
1359442713.0	17hgi9	Creep Watches Me Sleep	DrJeremyHillaryBoob	169	24	26	"I've been creeping (probably a poor choice of verb) this subreddit for a while and decided to finally make an account and write about something that happened to me as a child. 

This happened back in 1997 when I was ten years old but I'll do my best to recall it accurately. For the record, I am a female and at the time this story took place, was living in a suburban area of coastal Australia.

A little backstory: We lived on a main road. Our house had no fence at the front of the property, just a lot of greenery. There was a path that wrapped around the house that had a gate on each side. The gates were very poorly placed and consequently, there was nothing to stop someone from walking up the right hand side of our house (the side my bedroom was on). Even though it was a busy street, it was a safe neighbourhood. So although our house was ground level and relatively exposed, we never really had any reason to feel threatened.

It's funny how sometimes you can remember strange details about incidents you find to be traumatic. The night this took place, I remember placing my homework book (it was fifth grade - we had a ""homework book"") on my desk chair before going to bed. I was prone to forget things and the colour of my book contrasted more with the chair than it did with the desk so I thought there would be a better chance of me seeing it. This will be important later.

Okay, so later this night (probably around 2am), I'm fast asleep when something suddenly woke me up. I should note that I am and always have been a very heavy sleeper so it is exceedingly odd for me to just randomly wake up in the middle of the night unless I am having a nightmare or need to go to the bathroom. Unfortunately this occasion was due to neither of those.

I remember immediately feeling a sinking feeling in my stomach. Something was not right. I looked over to the corner of my room where my desk was located. It was very dark but I could see a man sitting on my desk chair. Not facing the desk. The chair was turned around to face me. He was in my room, sitting in the chair, staring at me. I could see he was wearing dark colours and had a hood pulled up which shadowed his face. I was too scared to make a sound.

At first I thought I was sleeping (though it felt VERY real) so I started pinching myself under the blanket. 

Nope. Not sleeping. 

Using my amazing kid-logic, I decided that running out of the room was too risky as he could easily grab me and do who-knows-what in my attempt to escape. So I pulled the blanket over my head and lay very very still. Awake for hours. Completely terrified. I remember hearing vague noises and when the sun was starting to come up, I peeked at the wall next to me and saw shadows dancing around as though someone was moving behind me. 

As soon as the room was fully lit and I hadn't heard any noises in a while, I slowly lowered the blanket. On confirming the man was gone, I booked it straight to my parents room. I remember sitting on their bed freaking the fuck out telling them how someone was in my room watching me sleep and seeing them exchange a doubtful glance. They told me it was just a nightmare, that sometimes nightmares can feel very real and then dismissed it.

I really didn't want to go back to my room but I reluctantly returned and started packing my school bag. I looked up to grab my homework book. Not only was my chair pulled out and turned around but my homework book was on my desk. I knew this probably wouldn't be enough evidence for my parents so I had an internal freak out and continued getting ready for school.

Fast forward about twenty minutes and my parents approach me with very pale faces. 

They had gone to go and hang out the laundry (walking from the laundry room to the backyard required walking past the outside of my bedroom) and on passing my window, they noticed that not only was my window wide open, but someone had ripped off the whole flyscreen outer window and placed it neatly leaning against the house.

I wish I could say we noped the fuck out of that house but we lived there for probably 6 more years. My parents eventually had a huge wall erected out front as well as security cameras. I honestly can't remember if my parents went to the police or not (I know, I know - I don't mean to be another ""didn't go to the police"" story but I honestly can't remember. It's quite possible that they did and just didn't involve me so as not to freak me out further). I remember the event more than I remember the aftermath. Suffice to say, my parents never again doubted my ability to differentiate between nightmares and reality.

I guess the moral of the story is to always lock your windows.

UPDATE: I asked my parents about this yesterday. My Mum said that they made a ""discreet inquiry"" to the police so as not to frighten me and the police informed them that they had several similar reports in the area, but as no one could give a viable description of the man and he wasn't stealing anything or harming anyone, there wasn't a whole lot they had to go by in terms of apprehending him. So my folks installed a gate at the front of the house, bought a big dog and checked on me multiple times every night for a good year or thereabouts. And of course, I always locked my window before bed."	t5_2t3t8	True
1350584219.0	11p9ef	From Floor Mate to Stalker in a Few Weeks	Sloth773	183	37	56	"[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/12h4ft/from_floor_mate_to_stalker_in_a_few_weeks/) is part two! Not as funny, but it was because this one was nearly 1.5 months of content, where number two have two weeks

As a Sophomore in college, I think it is safe to say 'Been there, done that' to a few things. And having a stalker is something I know many on here have faced. But let's turn the tables on this one. Many stories I have read on here have involved small females facing larger stalkers. But my story is the opposite. 

My name's Brandon, I'm 6' 6"", 19, and an overall big guy. I wear mostly black, I have long hair, and if you couldn't put two and two together, I love Metal and Horror movies. I have no major fears, except for a floor mate named Tori. As silly as it seems for a guy of my stature to be afraid of a girl who is maybe 5' 6"", and 21 years old, I have reasons.

It all began this year actually. This year, I moved in to the 'suburb' dorms at my school. By that I mean it is mostly students who do well and cause no real disturbances. Now bear with me as I describe how the dorms are laid out. Every dorm near mine is the same. Three floors that form a very wide T shape. The vertical line of the T is the main entrance to the dorms, as well as the stair well. The rooms line the bottom half of the horizontal line in the T shape. Where the two lines intersect, opposite of the other dorms, is two more rooms for single occupant rooms. Mine is one of them.

After the first few days of class, all seemed perfect. Made new friends from other floors, had some nice cigars outside facing the woods behind the dorm with them, all was good. Until Tori took notice of me.

It all started with the staring. Whenever I would be outside, whether by myself or with friends, she would sit inside the dorm and stare out the windows at me. She wouldn't be texting, reading, studying, or whatever. She stared at me. Needless to say, I was unnerved a bit.

At first, I thought nothing of it, until shit got weird.

First she would be walking outside my door at all hours, doing nothing but walking outside it. I could see this through my peephole. She has even stared in to my peephole some times. Then at the cafeteria, she started to sit closer and close each time (I would always sit in the same exact area). And again, she would just stare. And then eventually, she got to know my friends and whenever she saw them, she would ask about me.

An example of this would be actually what happened last week. My buddy Davide (his name, not a typo) came knocking on my door about midnight, asking if I wanted to have a cigar with him. As I stepped in to the hall after grabbing my cutter, lighter and cigar, she comes out of her room in her pajamas and walks outside to sit with Davide. She said she wanted to smoke with us. And by that, she meant light the filter of a cigarette and chew on it while staring at me.

My buddy Ryan told me a story about when she lived in his dorm. She apparently tried to seduce (and failed) every guy in her old dorm, and that when none wanted her, she flipped out by slamming doors, screaming at random, and one time she threw herself down a small half flight of stairs.

But what really set it all over was the time I played poker with the Residential Assistant. Me and my RA were playing and out comes Tori. She decides she will be the dealer. So she is dealing the cards, telling lie after lie how she is a bartender, how she is a professional dealer, how she can count cards. Each lie was greater than the last. While we were playing, she kept texting and yelling 'Oh my God' after every text. She kept slamming the cards she dealt harder and harder. And finally, she snapped.

She throws herself out of her chair. And by this I mean it looked like someone kicked her in the face and she flew on to the ground. She starts to roll around and scream and cry. She starts wailing 'My life is over!' and 'Oh my God I am stupid!'. She starts hitting the ground and rolling faster, so much so she has a minor asthma attack. She then gets up and runs in to her room, throwing the cards everywhere.

Apparently, she was dating a guy who was 28, with a kid, and still married but divorcing. She dated him since that morning. And he broke it off with her.

Oh, and for those of you wondering. I won the hand with two pair, Kings and Deuces.

And now there is an informational poster on what to do if someone has an asthma attack. It is right above the spot she rolled around on.

As stupid as this story may seem, it is one I love sharing with people around my campus, because they know exactly what is going on when I say there are some fucknuts here.

One thing is for certain, though. I have only experienced this much in one and a half months. I don't want to know what the rest of this semester, or year for that matter, will bring.

Oh and no, she is not attractive. Picture Frank the Rabbit from Donnie Darko, but not as hairy but looks just the same."	t5_2t3t8	True
1345729950.0	yp1d4	He knew where I lived.	marabear2685	183	35	13	"I have never been ashamed of my previous profession. Even though it is still seen as 'taboo' by many. Between 2008-2009 I was a prostitute in a brothel. 

I spent a long time working hard to earn my money, (bigger girls tend to be over looked in this area) but after a couple of months I had a few steady clients that asked for me alone. 

There was one in particular that was crazy for me...well the persona he believed was me anyway. He would bring dinner to me when he booked me on a night shift, or lunch if he booked day. He would bring flowers and candy and all manner of gifts- trying to win me over.

His name was Viktor and he was russian, unmarried and wealthy. He spent many bookings begging and pleading for me to run away with him. 'Faith, I will look after you better than any man!', 'Faith I can show you how to live!' He really was very sweet. 

He had some pretty specific fetishes, some BDSM kinks and a massive thing for feet (which sucked because my feet are extremely ticklish) He loved the look of stocking and netted stockings and requested for me to wear them in our bookings...and only them. It was a simple arrangement. He would arrive, beg and plead, we would get down to business, he would beg and plead some more and then he would leave.

Towards the end of my employment there, he started to go a bit funny, one particular day the booking before him ran a little long (sometimes they just don't want to get out!) and when I finally got around to Viktor, he was livid, he threw me on the bed and spanked me like I have never been before. He demanded to know who he was and what was going on. I screamed loud enough from the spanking that one of the girls alerted the manager on at the time and she buzzed the speaker in the room.

I explained to Viktor that if I didn't answer straight away that she would come in to make sure everything was alright. He shoved himself away from me and with his back turned to me he undressed. I buzzed back to show that I was alright, albeit a little shaken, but it seemed to have passed. 

We got straight to business and when he was done and dressing, he asked me why I wasn't wearing my stockings. I explained to him that they had broken in our last session together and I was currently trying to hunt up a new pair. He said nothing else as I walked him out. 

Not being a driver, I normally caught a taxi to and from the place, living only 30 minutes away. A few days after the booking, I arrived home from a friday night shift (7pm to 7am) to find a small package on my doorstep. I took it inside and unwrapped it to find a set of black, nylon stockings- in my size. A simple note was a attached to it saying:

                    I'm sorry.
                             -Viktor.
I didn't ring the police, because it would have gotten tricky with me being in the line of work I was in, but when I got to my next shift I showed the manager and told her I couldn't take any more bookings with him. She agreed that it would be for the best. 

I stayed on for a few more weeks, but recieved an invitation from a friend to move in with her for awhile to help with rent and I gladly accepted, moving from my current home and profession to a lovely townhouse in a quiet suburb working the check out in the local supermarket. From time to time I wonder what would have come of it if I had of stayed in my old place and kept working at the brothel. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1345081543.0	yao5a	Story from across the border	pipian	170	25	40	"This is one of my favorite subreddits, but I have noticed that most of the stories written here happened in the USA. Here is a little taste of the horrors we live through south of the border, in Mexico.

This happened to a friend of my mother's relatives. A family of four: Arturo, the dad, Maria, the mom, Eduardo, the son and the Ana, the daughter, who happened to be extremely beautiful. They live in Mexico city, but as is common for upper-middle to upper class families, they went to spend a long weekend to Acapulco, a vacation spot that, frankly, has seen better days, as it was overshadowed by Cancun in the 80s. Acapulco had recently been the focus of gang-related warfare, since home-grown gangs refused to cede territory to the powerful Sinaloa cartel. This inconvenience, however, did not completely stop the flow of tourists to the once gorgeous, now decadent port, and did not stop Arturo and his family, thing that they would later regret enormously.

The family was dining in a restaurant next to the sea, enjoying the delicious seafood, when the waiter, clearly nervous, came to the table with a bottle of expensive Champagne and a note: ""This is from those gentlemen over there"", he said, pointing at a table where sat four men that you could just tell at first glance were narcos, wearing gold chains, rings and the like, and drinking Johnie Walker Blue Label. Arturo unfolded the note and read: ""This is for you to have a toast with your daughter, as this is the last night you will ever see her.""

Arturo got up, left 1000 pesos on the table for the meal, and they went straight back to the hotel, where, in terror, they made their bags and prepared to leave immediately.

Along the way to Mexico city, there are several desolate stretches where all you can see is desert and perhaps some misshapen little houses and a gas station. Arturo stopped the car at one of those gas stations to fill up. As he was filling up, two cars suddenly pulled into the gas station, one parking in front and one behind the family's car. They had been followed. Several men exited the vehicles and pointed their AR-15s at the family. They came to honor their word, they came for Ana. According to Arturo, there are few worse feelings than being powerless as you watch your daughter, screaming and kicking, being dragged into a car, which then speeds away over the horizon, never to be seen again.

This is only one of many stories that have happened to me or my known ones, and I would be happy to share more if people are interested. Unfortunately, most of these incidents go unreported, since the fear of retaliation is too great."	t5_2t3t8	True
1342025805.0	we50p	the guy in the clothing store.		187	40	58	"i was 16 at the time, i went into a really neat looking clothing store, there was an older man at the desk, he was probably about 60, everything is fine i am just looking at the clothing, he said nothing just watched, i assumed he was just watching so i didn't steal anything, as i was a teenager.

i picked out a few things to try on, and asked him where the fitting rooms were, he pointed to the back, still said nothing.

the fitting room doesn't lock, it only has a curtain covering it, it doesn't bother me at this point, this is fairly normal in stores here, but while i am changing i notice the curtain move, and that he is peeking in, i got dressed as quickly as i could, and push passed him to leave the store.

i got to the door to find the curtains had been drawn, and there were slide and turn locks down the door, all locked now, i am starting to get scared at this point, i tried to unlock the door but i only had a few opened when i was pulled over to the couch in a back room by my wrist, he was strong for being as old as he was.

he sat me down and passed me a drink, i was about run for the door again, but i noticed a wall with a knife collection on it, he never threatened me with any of them, but i think he knew that them being behind him were threat enough, he calmly told me to drink what he gave me, me knowing that it was most likely drugged, i sipped it and spit it back into the glass without him noticing, it was alcohol of some kind.

he calmly picked at his nails with a pocket knife while asking odd questions like ""do you have any pets"", ""where do you think they will go when they die"", where do you think you will go when you die"", ""do you want me to die"", just weird things to ask, this went on for about a half hour, i kept glancing over at the door figuring out the best way to get it open quickly enough.

when i worked up the courage to attempt to leave, i splashed my drink in his eyes, it probably really hurt as it was hard liquor, and i bolted to the door unlocking all the locks quickly, i was on the last one when my wrist was grabbed again, but i quickly reached to unlock to door and pull the handle before i was dragged too far back, i yelled out the door attracting attention from people on the street, he let go and ran into the back room, i ran out the door."	t5_2t3t8	True
1375724618.0	1jr3k4	Supermarket Stalker! ...and then some.	jdp96	174	29	30	"This is my first post on r/letsnotmeet... Well, first post on here ever actually. I've been reading people's creepy encounters on here for a while, and thought it was perhaps about time that I share my own encounter.

For context, I was sixteen years old at the time, and also very short and skinny; the least threatening person you could imagine. I'd just got my first ever job as a checkout girl at the one supermarket in my small town, which I was really excited about. Also, I live in England.

When I finished my first year at college I found myself agreeing to every overtime shift that I possibly could. To be precise, I ended up working either 4pm-8pm, 5pm-9pm, or 6pm-10pm every weekday. Sure, I had regular customers (e.g. the drunken tramps of the town, who were always very nice and easy to talk to, despite the smell they emitted) but there was one man who I eventually noticed was coming in every single day, at the same time, sometimes more than once. He was an Indian man, about thirty years old, had a receeding hairline, and absolutely always wore horribly patterned shorts with socks and sandals. He always wore shirts that looked out of place. His collection of Hawaiian shirts were very ugly indeed. (Nobody who's completely normal would wear that, right?!)

No matter how long my queue of customers was, he'd make sure to join it. If there was three people in the queue doing there big weekly shop, he would join in on the end despite always having a basket with never less than four items in it. I thought nothing of it the first few times. I would always make idle chit-chat, because that's part of the job really. He seemed to really like talking to me, but then again some elderly people come in just to talk so I dismissed that. I realised something was up when he began asking me, every day, what time I finished that night. I would always tell him that I finished at half eleven at night, by which time the supermarket was shut, just because I usually fear the worst.

My fears were confirmed a month and half or so later when he came to my till as usual, seeming to be annoyed. He started shouting. ""I've waited outside for you at quarter past eleven every night for the last week! I didn't see you, not once. I checked both exits, you've lied to me!"" Er, creep alert much? I hate to say this but I was scared so I apologised and mumbled something about being allowed to leave early all of the days which he must of waited. I hated upsetting people, no matter how creepy or weird. I've learnt my lesson now.

On another occasion he asked for my number, to which I told him I didn't have one. He seemed frustrated and replied ""Come on, you must have some way I can contact you. What about a landline?"" To which I ever so sneakily gave him the supermarket I worked for's number. Absolutely genius right?!

After these incidents reoccurring for about two months I told my supervisors who kindly would look out for him, and upon seeing him join my till they would come and take over and let me breifly run away. I didn't want to tell anyone at first because I was new to the job, and was reluctant to cause a scene. One of the supervisors told me he handed in a bunch of flowers for me at the customer service desk... on a few occasions. Another of my supervisors informed me that he would often come in on the rare occasion that I wasn't working, look around for me and perhaps ask someone if I was working, and when he would hear that I wasn't working he would leave without buying anything. Sometimes I'd see him in the supermarket after that but he could never talk to me, because  I would run and hide somewhere in the supermarket. I stopped doing so much overtime shortly after anyway, as I returned to college after the summer to study a new course.

It didn't all end there though. There's only one way to walk into town from my house, which I frequent a lot. There also used to be a small shop I'd walk past on the way, which seemed to sell bags, suitcases and phone cases that were all generally rather tacky and ugly. I'd never been in this shop, just seen the window displays. This is important later.

I'd always walk home with headphones in, which I now understand is a big mistake. One day I was shuffling home from a day at college, on a rare hot day in England, with no headphones in. I could hear someone walking behind me, but out of not wanting to look rude I held my phone up in front of me, like a mirror, to see who was behind me. So sneaky once again! Anyway it was my old friend from the checkout, staring straight at me. He didn't know that I knew he was behind me though.

Despite being five minutes from my house, I didn't want to run home and have him knew where I lived. Instead, I thought the best idea would be to walk quickly and hide. So that's what I did; I sped up my pace and once I got round the corner where he was a few meters behind, I quite literally darted into a bush. Peering out of it, I saw him as he turned the corner. He looked around, slightly confused, and then I heard him shout to someone I couldn't I see, ""Where is she? Where did she go?"" To which a man with a similar accent in similarly broken English replied that he didn't know. I hid here for until they walked back past in the direction they'd came then I ran off home.

I never once told my parents that any of this was happening. So, so naive.

A week later I was packing my suitcase, for my family holiday which was a fortnight away, when I broke the zip to my suitcase. My dad said he'd come to the shitty bag/suitcase/phonecase shop with me to get a new suitcase, because it was close to our  house.  Upon entering I saw my old friend ONCE AGAIN. It was his shop! I tried to remain calm, as my parents didn't know about him, and also largely because I was a wimp and somehow had convinced myself it was all a misunderstanding. I avoided further eye contact, pointed out a suitcase to my dad, then told him I was going to wait outside because I was hot.

I was shaking with nerves. Everything made a lot more sense now - he'd know when I was working because in order to get to work, I'd have to walk past his fucking shop. And that was how he'd followed me home that time too. I reckon he followed me more than once though, because like I said, that was the one time I forgot my headphones.

When me and my dad got home I explained everything to him. My dad's pretty scary - he's an ex ""football thug"", who changed his ways when he met my mum (lol). He went straight back to that shop and, from what he says ""had a bloody good word with that c**t, and knocked some sense into him"". Whenever I had to go to town for the next week I'd get a lift off one of my parents  or my brother. Then, when we returned from our three week holiday, the shop and flat above it (where he must of lived) was boarded up.

I haven't seen the creepy man since, and I've gained a lot more confidence in the year-and-a-bit since this all happened. I can't believe he was so close by the whole time  - likewise, I can't believe I was so stupid to walk around obliviously with headphones in, in the midst of all this, and also I regret not telling anyone sooner. I can't believe I just passed it all off because I didn't want to cause a scene. The police never got involved, most likely because my stalker was highly unlikely to report that he'd been beaten up by my dad for stalking me for around seven months.

Sorry for making it so long, I just finally wanted to tell the story properly. I'm also sorry if I did anything wrong, I am new to all this. Any questions then feel free to comment and I'll get back to you! Thank you for reading, it really does mean a lot.

**EDIT: Just thought I'd add that I now have a new job. I now work in a tiny office which hasn't seen a lick of paint since 1970 or something, where the aircon always breaks when it's hot and the heating always breaks when it's cold. However, I love it because I don't want to work with the public after this!**"	t5_2t3t8	True
1372391126.0	1h868u	The worst 3 months of my life		182	36	36	"This happened a few years ago, and it was absolutely terrifying.

I went to an audition for a play at my local community theatre. I had done several plays there, and knew pretty much everyone auditioning. Except this one guy. I saw him walk in and thought ""Wow...that guy looks like a rapist."" I should have trusted my gut.

So the audition process is taking forever and of course he sits right next to me. He said his name was Austin, that he thought I was a really good actress from what he had just seen, and that he was a model (yeah right), and how beautiful I was...yadda yadda.

Anyway, he kept this up throughout the whole audition process. We eventually get done and I'm waiting on my mom to pick me up. I was 16 at the time, not yet driving. He asked if I needed a ride. I said no, obviously. Then he gave me his number and told me to look him up on Myspace. He made a kissy face at me and then walked off.

I thought ""Well, this guy's kinda weird but he's been really nice, I'll give him a chance."" So I added him on Myspace and we started talking. He was being much more normal, so I gave him my phone number and we would talk every once in a while. Things escalated pretty quickly.

He spent an hour talking to me on the phone about how he had an idea for a new government, how he planned on rewriting the constitution, and I assume step 3 was taking over the world. I tuned him out after awhile. He then informed me that he was schizophrenic and no longer on medication. At this point I finally got some sense knocked into me and decided we wouldn't be talking anymore. He didn't like that idea.

Very soon he started calling me 13 times a day. When he figured out I wasn't answering his calls, he started calling me from different numbers that I wouldn't recognize so that I would answer. Any time he would manage to get me on the phone he would tell me how long I had to talk to him, when he was going to go out with me, and that he was not accepting excuses.

This went on for three months. I really wanted to get a restraining order on him. He was 21, I was 16, I thought I might be able to. But no one I talked to seemed too concerned.

He eventually stopped calling but I was scared to go out in public- afraid I would run into him.

About a year or so later, I found a chair in the woods next to my house. It was placed so that anyone sitting in it could see directly into my bedroom window. I have no idea if it was him, if it was just a fluke, or some other creeper. The chair eventually disappeared, but to this day I have towels covering all my windows so that no one can see in no matter what.

Moral of this story: If you think someone might be crazy...they probably are."	t5_2t3t8	True
1351923169.0	12jztv	It was easier to say I drank too much	vengeful_hamster	172	30	37	"I'm sorry if the writing is not good, I'm doing this to be therapeutic for me. It ended up longer than I thought it would be and I left out some details. 

Two years ago my life was completely different. I was in a sorority, I had lots of friends, I was outgoing. That was until the night of our Halloween grab a date. For those who have never been in the greek system it's a party where you invite only one person as a date.

I had recently met a gorgeous guy who was on my colleges football team. I invited him and he said yes, but that his friend from out of town had to go too. I convinced a naive freshman to take him. On the afternoon of the day there was a football game so unlike the majority of girls and their dates I had to wait for my date instead of getting drunk. The game ended with just enough time to take a shot of vodka with my date and the two guys before we had to rush to the bus to meet the freshman and go to the boat where the party would be held. 
I ended up finding my date and his friend rather creepy while on the boat and ignored him for most of the night and danced with my friends. Unfortunately my keys were at his apartment so after we got off the boat and back to the greek system I had to return to his place. 

This was when things went wrong. I quickly went to his place and grabbed my keys but by the time I found them he had poured a shot for each of us (it was just me, his friend, and himself). I at first declined but they insisted I take it before I leave. I don't remember anything after that shot.

The grab a date was on October 30th, Halloween morning I woke up to a strange beeping. I was extremely confused and had no idea where I was, but I was terrified. I felt too weak to move and after a few minutes realized the beeping was coming from the machine that I was attached to. Even then I didn't realize where I was, I just started yelling. After what seemed an eternity a grumpy nurse walked in. I asked her for a phone which she gave me and left. In my confusion I couldn't figure out the phone so I had to yell for her to come back. Eventually, it was figured out and I called my dad. This was the scariest halloween for my dad, waking up early from an unknown caller that ended up being your daughter two hours away in the ER. 

After that phone call I fell asleep and woke up to my dad in the room crying. 

It turned out that I had stopped breathing a few times that night. The first time was within a half hour of taking that shot. I later found out that rather than calling for help he left my body on the steps of my sorority where thankfully another girl was coming home while he was walking away. She was the one who called the ambulance. 
Unfortunately I did not get tested, in my confusion I refused to be drug tested that morning and kept insisting that I wanted to go home. Too weak to walk I had to be wheel chaired out then carried to my dads car. My dads partner works in the ER said that it sounded like I had an allergic reaction to roofies. One of my moms friends from a hospital suggested that as well. But by the time I wanted to be checked the hospital said it would have been out of my system by then. 

Later that day, I looked through my cell phone and found I had texted a few of my friends for help, that I was creeped out, that I was scared. I had also received a text from him saying he wanted me to go to the bathroom and give him head. I decided to reply to his text and ask him what happened that I had woken up in the hospital. He replied ""that sucks"".

As if this ordeal wasn't enough after a few days when I returned to the school and sorority a rumor had started that I had had alcohol poisoning.  When I tried claiming that wasn't what happened people told me I was just too embarrassed to admit it. I was even sent to standards (sorority court for where you get punished) and told I wasn't allowed to go on another grab a date that quarter. Very few girls asked if I was okay, I wasn't.

1350506139.0	11ndyr	The Fat Lady	khvalheim	188	38	17	"This story happened when I was about five or so, and it's really more humorous than terrifying. Anyway, my siblings, my father, and I were visiting my mother in the hospital. We stayed until visiting hours were over, which was some time after dark. On our way out, we had quite a surprise.

Okay, so, the exit for hospital was set up so that you had to walk through a couple of sets of automatic glass doors before getting out of the building. As we walked through the exit, my family stopped at the first set of doors. I didn't notice this, and kept on walking, but it wasn't long before I realized. I looked back at them and they all had shocked expressions on their faces. I turned to face the outer doors, and that's when I saw it. A morbidly obese, bare naked woman standing outside, pounding on the glass doors of the hospital. I watched in horror as she tried to force her way in, picking up one of those tall metal ashtray/garbage cans and hurling it at the door. Turning tail, I ran back to the safety of my Dad. Thankfully, the hospital staff knew about the situation outside, and managed to lock the outer doors before she got there.

Eventually, we were able to leave the hospital once the cops arrived and arrested her. Christ, though. I would definitely NOT want to meet that  lady again."	t5_2t3t8	True
1339711405.0	v2e5q	Harassment at work..	iMarvelAtThis	166	23	14	"First time poster, been reading through these creepy stories for a while now and has brought back a similar experience which happened to me not too long ago.  I used to think there was no reason not to feel safe at work, but I was wrong! 

I was about 18 at the time, and was working an evening shift at a cafe which happens to be part of a supermarket. It was a pretty boring shift, little amount of customers in the store etc, and there was only 2 other staff in the cafe. 

So anyway, I was standing at the till trying to look busy and a man casually strolls up to me. He tells me he wants a coke, and I explain the coke machine is self service. He just stares at me, so I ask what size drink he wants and just pour it for him anyway. He then orders some food, the whole time just staring at me, but I don't think anything of it. He then takes the closest seat next to the cash register, and still I don't really think anything of it. 

After a few minutes of bringing his order out, he walks back up to the till and starts talking to me. He asks me if I like going out clubbing and what clubs I go too. I just mention a few of the generic popular ones in my town. He mentions a bar which has a reputation for being a bit rough, and asked me if I want to go there with him at the weekend. I just say no thank you, to be polite. 

  He then started asking loads of questions, ""what is your name"", ""where do you live"", ""what time do you finish work?"". I lied to every question, and started to get freaked out. He then said ""ok ill wait for you outside"". I really didn't know what to say at this point. I sort of edged away to the kitchen area in the cafe and quickly told the supervisor about the man and what he had said. 

She quickly called a security guy to come over, and we went to the front of the cafe to find the man. He was no where to be seen, and had even left the food and drink he had ordered behind untouched. 

I was convinced he was actually gonna be waiting for me outside when I finished, so I was really freaked out. And I was so thankful that my supervisor offered to give me a lift home, otherwise it would have been a 30 minute walk from the town centre for me. 
Needless to say, the man wasn't waiting for me outside and thankfully I never saw him again.

1374889808.0	1j4xu2	The car that followed us	owllamp	191	43	14	"For reference, I’m a girl and was 17 when this happened, my sister was 14.

It was the afternoon and I’d gone to pick my sister up from gymnastics because my parents were out of town. Now my town is pretty small, so it isn’t necessarily strange to have a car driving behind you for a while, but for some reason the green car that had been following us for the past couple of minutes had gotten my attention. 

My worry became magnified when they turned their blinker on to follow us down our residential street. Even though people do use the road as a shortcut my chest got tight and I felt sick to my stomach. Despite the anxiety I pulled into my driveway, which was incredibly stupid and I should have kept driving. I turned off my car and looked back to see the car pull into the parking lot of the small church across the road with the car facing our house. My sister hadn’t noticed the car, and I hadn’t said anything, so she started to get out. I told her to get back in. I cranked the car back up and started to back out. The car pulled out and left. 

I sat in my car and called my mom who called the police. The officer came by and took a statement for a report and told us that we had to be careful because we were “pretty girls.” As if attractiveness had anything to do with it. I felt he wasn’t taking me seriously because I could not logically explain the feeling of dread that I’d had. They patrolled my street that afternoon and that’s all that came of it. A couple of weeks later we heard about a man that knocked on the door of a young girl in town who was home alone and tried to lure her into his car, which happened to be green.

1347653863.0	zw6n6	Cupcakes and... lubricant?	celery_stalk	179	35	34	"Started creeping here a couple of months ago and fell in love. Originally, I was sad I didn't have any stories to tell, and I kept wracking my brain for any creepy memories but couldn't think of any. Then this past week a couple of small things accumulated up to me saying, ""Damn, I think this is LetsNotMeet worthy."" So I created this account to share. It's long, though. Sorry!

I'll start by saying I'm a 21 year old female. I just got a new job hostessing at a restaurant in the downtown area of the very large city I live in. Above the restaurant are pretty pricey lofts. On the first floor is where I work, along with the lobby, elevators, Chipotle, and a bakery; all of which have at least one door near the back of the store that leads to the lobby. When I got the job, I got access to the parking garage that the residents use. From there I can take a backway to the lobby, which leads to one of the doors connected to my job. 

Every day I work, I pass a concierge working for the lofts. Occasionally we speak to them, like if one of the lobby's restrooms goes out of order, but other than that it's pretty rare. Which is why I thought it was odd when I saw Mike. He's the nightly concierge, looks around late 40's to early 50's, round glasses, short. He was around the bar, scanning the area like he was looking for something. When he saw me, he came over and asked me for some extra promotion cards that we had been handing out to guests so he could give some to the residents. I simply asked my manager for some and gave it to Mike, that was it. At the end of my shift, Mike comes in and gives me four chocolate covered strawberries, thanking me for my help. I'm used to everyone at this job and area being very polite and kind, so I accepted them with excitement and without a second thought. 

A couple of days later I saw Mike again. I was packing a to-go order when he came up and said he had something for me, to follow him. At the concierge desk, he presents me with a bag that reminded me of old brown lunchbags, but was white, and an envelope. Inside the bag was a cupcake, and inside the envelope was two miniature Hershey's chocolate bars. At this point I was beginning to feel too much attention had been placed on myself. I needed to share, after all; sharing is caring, right?! I faked excitement (which I realize I shouldn't have), thanked him, and asked if he'd met the other new hostess, Michelle, whom I was working with that night. He said no, so I introduced them. Ten minutes later, he brings a second cupcake. Too many sweets make me nauseous, so I ended up giving it to Michelle. He hands the cupcake to me, saying, ""Stop by the desk on your way out. I have something for you."" But the look on his face.. It was creepy. I'm not exactly sure what it was, but it reminded me of the way a child looks when they've given good news and they're waiting to be praised. Now I'm starting to think, ""Ugh, it better not be another damn cupcake."" The night goes by slowly, and Mike, yet again, comes in and searches for me. I'm at one of the computers putting in an order and he hands me two sheets of paper with some stuff typed on them. He says he's writing a book about the history of the lofts. ...Okay? You're writing a book and you hand me barely a page and half worth of text? Whatever. At the end of the night I asked one of my best friends that I work with to stop by the desk with me because I didn't want to go alone. Turns out it's a third cupcake. Along with a Cosmopolitan magazine, and inside that is a printout of a joke that someone emailed him. The cover of the magazine is '78 CRAZY-HOT SEX FACTS', which I try to ignore. He'd crossed out the name of the resident it was being mailed to. Read the magazine, threw away the cupcake, joke wasn't funny.

Finally, last night I pass him as I'm coming in. As soon as he sees me his face lights up and I cringe inside. This guy is nice and all but, too much is too much. He stops me and asks, ""Hey, did you lose your purse?"" No, I didn't. ""Well.."", and he pulls a small shopping bag out and it's completely full. I didn't really want to look inside, so I kind of skimmed the top. As I was pretending to be interested in the bag, he says, ""You're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen so.."" and trails off waiting for my reply. I acted like I didn't hear him and just thanked him with a fake smile, avoiding eye contact. ""Do you want to look at it here or..?"" I tell him no, I must clock in before I'm late (I was thirty minutes early). I power walk away and as soon as I step inside the restaurant, I find Michelle and my manager and tell them what a nice surprise Mike gave me. They knew how creeped out I was by Mike, so they were tens times more ecstatic than I was to see my little shopping bag. We take it to the back to inspect the items. Lots and lots of miniature feminine care products. Chapstick, wipes, perfume samples, a tampon, toothbrush, toothpaste, etc. And then the motherload. A small bottle of fucking Astroglide Natural Lubricant. I do a laugh that is equivalent to 'Are you serious?!' I feel violated for some reason. Really really uncomfortable. I keep laughing though, because I can't believe this old man just gave me lube. Everyone is having laughing fits too; Michelle, the bartender, my manager, even some of the servers. ANYWAY, I don't look at the rest of the bag's contents. My manager offered to speak to Mike on my behalf to get him to stop, but I've never been the type to let other people do the talking for me. I'll do it the next time he tries to give me something. The night wears on and I'm on the phone taking an order to-go when Mike comes and drops of another cupcake. Yay. Gave it to Michelle again. She told me when she came in before me, he had asked her if she knew when I was coming in. Upon hearing my arrival was two hours away he says, ""Awww, I have to wait a whole two hours before I get to see her?!' She said it didn't look like he was joking. Had to ask my manager to walk me to my car because I felt like Mike was going to follow me out there or pop out of the shadows or something. We did run into him after we left, but he didn't say more than 'Goodnight' thankfully. 

After some deep gossip with a girl that's been working there for a couple of years, she enlightens me. She had come in to eat last night so she was there and saw everything, too. Mike was like this to another girl, the one whose shifts I took after she quit. She said he probably just grabbed all of that stuff from gift bags from a party the banquet hall had earlier, not even paying attention to what was in them. But still.. inappropriate. And the 'book' he was writing? Showed her the papers and she said it's straight from a brochure the lofts give new residents about the history of the building. My general manager was thoroughly creeped out as well, and he's a creeper himself. He jokes like, ""He gave you a bottle of lube?! That's inappropriate, I'm going to have to confiscate that, okay?"" He brought up a good point that I hadn't realized, though. The cupcakes.. they were homemade, and nobody knew what he put in those. I could be eating semen while he sits at the bar, getting off on watching me/us eat it. I thought they were from the bakery next door. 

I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not. I mean, the guy seems harmless, but I've only known him a grand total of three days. 

Oh, and this is my first post! If I'm making any mistakes let me know. I like constructive criticism! "	t5_2t3t8	True

 I ran out of body wash and face wash today, so I headed over to Walgreens to buy some more. As I went to the register to check out, there were two people in front of me: an older woman, who appeared frail and fragile, and a man. 

This man was about 6'10"" and of middle eastern descent. He seemed harmless as I went to get in line, but as he turned around, he stood completely still with a huge, toothy grin on his face. I smiled back, just to be polite, but he just stood there, silent, smiling.

I tried to busy myself by looking at some things on shelves near the counter, but, out of the corner of my eye, I saw him moving. He was dancing. He danced as if his feet were catching fire. It looked inhuman. I looked over at him and let out an uncomfortable chuckle, then acted like I got a phone call. Once again, I could see him out of the corner of my eye. He was crouched behind me, staring. 

I checked out and speed-walked to my car. As I pulled out, I saw him in my rear view mirror, following me in his blue Rav4. I drove around, finally lost him after pulling into a nearby police station, then headed home. 

The grin never left his face. Not once."	t5_2t3t8	True
1328670443.0	pfoqp	Birthday surprises. (NSFW?) 	failright	182	34	14	"Hey, this is a story of my 2 most memorable birthday ""surprises.""  Let me start out by saying these events happened on my 5th birthday, with mostly my cousins and also people I didn't know at the house to celebrate.
Dad had invited a million and one of his friends, all of them somehow knowing me and my twin.   After they had gotten drunk karaoking in the dining room and eating their beer bellies full, my mom thought t was time to light the candles.  We all gathered in our living room, about 20 people hovering over my twin and I and the rest sitting on the couch or still drinking in the dining room.   I should also include that my dad is a domestic abuser, alcoholic, and had used verbal abuse toward my mom too many times to count during my childhood.
The traditional happy birthday song began, and just as my sister and I went to blow the candles, one of my impatient cousins decided we couldn't do it on our own, so she blew out all the candles.  My sister and I looked at her and that's when it started.  

""Your stupid girl blew out the candles!"" A voice said in Vietnamese, directed toward the father of her.  
""What did you say?!""  My dad, who was the brother of the wish-theif's father, yelled at the person.  ""Don't talk to him like that!"" And a punch flew toward the person.  
After that I only remember getting hurried to my room that I shared with 3 other sisters.  All my cousins were crammed through the window my mom opened, and then she rushed back to where the fight was to try to get to the phone, to call the police, which was incoviniently located in the living room with them.  I ran toward, wanting to be with my mom, the open front door and saw my dad ripping the wall phone from her hand and throwing it at the floor.  

Only two of the men there, out of roughly 30 he invited, helped my mom just as my dad was about to hit her.  The fight circulated outside as all the children got into the spare cars and the mothers drove to my cousin's house, only 15 minutes away.  We got into the house, locked the doors, checked if everyone was alright, and separated my 6 sisters and I to try to sleep the event off for the time being.  
Almost everyone slept together on the floor of their living room with their moms when my cousin's mom came in and said that my older cousin (let's call him Mike who is about 15) had decided to share with one person.  My mom volunteered my twin, who had a mental handicap and might be better off in a bed.  That's when he walked out awkwardly, and even I could tell something was.. wrong with him.
The whole room suddenly stopped for a second, seeming like everyone got the same vibe.  One of my older sisters (let's say Tesa) stood up and said she would volunteer.  I looked at her and saw that she looked unsure and cautious, even seeming scared.    
I don't know what got into me, but apparently I suddenly stood up and ran over toward Mike and stood next to him, looking excited to be sleeping with my older cousin.  I must have been an expert liar as a kid, because I still get the shivers around him to this day. 
 
We went to his room, closed the door, and turned off the light.  I slept facing the wall while he put his arm around me and the blanket to my nose height. (Holy shit, he was basically spooning with me.) Being the innocent kid I was, I just thought that this was normal. 
Then I felt a hand.  It was in an ordinary place; it was on my stomach.   But then he pulled me closer, and then stuck his hand in a place I KNEW was not right.  My eyes opened from my half sleep and I stared at the wall, trying to comprehend,with all the intelligence a five year old could have, what the fuck he was doing.
I tried to scoot away from him, and by a stroke of luck (but very bad luck for everyone not in his room) I heard my dad kick open the front door and the screams of the people in the living room and kitchen.  
I jumped up, and so did Mike.  Quickly jumping off the bed and opening the door, I saw my dad wielding a gun and pointing it toward my mom, who was one her knees with her head down, begging for forgiveness in Vietnamese while crying. 

Mike's mom saw me and grabbed me to huddle with the rest of the kids on the couch, which didn't make any sense because he actually had a clearer shot of our heads there.  -__-
My boss of a grandma bravely went to the wall phone she had, which was right behind my mom and adjacent to the front door, and called 911.  A few more moments of my dick of a dad yelling and threatening to shoot everyone later, the police arrived and arrested him by force.
You'd think that my mom would divorce him and let him rot in prison after that, right?  No.  My mom actually BAILED him out, dropped charges, and then proceeded to let him LIVE back with us.  


Currently, I am 15 and he is still here.  Mike is still here, too.  He is now married and has a son.  He acts as if nothing happened.  My dad is seemingly nicer, but still verbally abuses everyone who lives ""under his roof."" 


Tldr; my dad starts a fight, threatens my everyone's life, and gets arrested on my birthday. My cousin used the opportunity to get in my 5 year old pants.

1376302821.0	1k76f3	You don't love me	livinfreeneasy	187	42	21	"this is a long one. I haven't really told anyone how badly this has affected me. 

A couple of years ago I dated this guy named Joey. I had just gotten out of a relationship a few months earlier with a guy because of lack of interest with each other. we had just gotten bored with it idk when your 21 you don't make good choices most of the time. 

ANYWHO. I met Joey on FB and after two days of texting each other he can basically describe me down to my fucking favorite type of socks. he was always really good at figuring people out. Joey was a bigger guy. . . the kind of guy you see in movies who start the bar fights. i was drawn in and enjoyed his company. he was like a teddy bear to me, rough on the outside but sweeter than sweet on the inside. we saw each other for a few weeks going on dates and having a really great time. I learned that he was a tattoo artist and he was a divorced dad of two. He told me his ex was crazy and wouldnt let him see the kids because of the bad break up. 

Joey asked me to move in with him on week4. I was love struck by how nice he was. He had the best stories and would keep me entertained and distracted even in my worst mood. it was rushed to me but i was in the moment and agreed. so a week later i moved all my things into his house. 

Joey lived with his mother and step father. He took care of them with the money he made as a tattoo artist. his mother had a bad leg and worked at a laundry mat ""under the table"" so she could get her gov. check too. everything seemed great that first week. like i found a guy who really understood my oddness and could make me smile. 

it wasnt until the second week i started noticing small changes in his attitude. Joey would only go to work when i did. i worked at a grocery store and worked night shifts so i thought nothing of it at first. he said he was great at his job and people made appointments to fit his needs so he could work like that. so i never had a moment when i got off work that he wasnt there. He was always there. 

Soon it became a habit at night for him to beg me to lay on his chest and run my fingers through his chest hair. i thought it was sweet at first. until he got very upset with me the moment i seemed tired of it. it got to a point to where he would make me stay on his chest until he fell asleep. i felt like maybe i was a bad girlfriend by not wanting to indulge him so i didn't press the matter. 

Joey started dropping me off and picking me up from work. he would spend the last 20 minutes of my shift bagging groceries and making conversation with everyone. everyone loved Joey. He was just so damn smooth with words you couldn't help but enjoy the conversation. people thought it was romantic of him to want to be with me. i thought it was at first. then i got aggravated when he down right refused to let me drive myself to work. 

3 weeks into our relationship living together Joey made it clear he wanted me to delete every picture i had of my ex. of any ex. of any boy on my computer. in fact he wanted me to delete my fb delete all men from my phone and not talk to any of them at all. most of my friends are male. ive always had a hard time getting along with girls and the only girl i do hang out with is a butch lesbian. his reasoning was ""i love you so much i dont want to talk to anyone else. why would you?"" i felt like this is probably what ruined my last relationship. so i tried it. i kept conversations with males to a very min. my only friends who could come over were sarah and nathan (both who were gay) 

a week passes and Joey starts to question my friendship with sarah. its become quite clear to him that we are sneaking around his back and making out the 2 minutes were not in the same room as him. im obviously a cheating lying scumbag for doing so. the fights start at this point. the constant accusations and no trust from him at all. 

now at this point i should have left. hell i should have never went in the first place. he was just too smooth about it all. I never had to cook clean or anything. when i got off work he had dinner already made. he had a bowl packed a movie we'd like to watch and an ear to hear my problems. he seemed like such a great guy. i felt ungrateful for feeling like he was trying to keep me locked away. it was a MINDFUCK. 

4 months pass and my life is a bird  stuck in a cage. i never go out anymore. sarah hardly visits for fear of joey's eyes. things dont add up. all these things i thought i knew about him start to seem more like a lie every day. whenever i got even 5 mins alone with joeys mom i would try to hint at what i was worried about. but she always backed up everything he said. i cant talk to anyone on my phone now. 3 messages or more and that qualified as a ""conversation"" and that wasnt allowed. i was in fear now. his small threats of dominance loomed over me. hinting at what he could do if i tried to leave him. i was scared to sleep most nights and ended up staring at his chest moving. sometimes i would start a fight to see if i could make him not want me. i would scream and cry and just be a bitch to get out of the house. but he always used his words against me. making me feel weak. something i've NEVER allowed. i still dont know why i was such a coward to him. sure he was twice my size, an ex MMA fighter and had a temper. but my mother trained me to be a bitch with a baseball bat under my truck seat. never to be afraid. i couldnt over come that fear of what if he hurt me? 

one night a local band i like is playing at a bar. i ask joey if we can go and he astonishingly says he'd love to. we go and by surprise a big group of my friends i hadnt seen in 4 months had decided to go too. i try not to make it too obvious that im happy to see them. i dont want joey to push them away. i always stay a bit distant but try to talk to them as much as possible at the same time. we ended up leaving after only an hour of being there. Joey didnt want me talking to todd, my old BEST friend. even though he was gay joey wasnt convinced. 

the next day todd calls me and asks me to hang out for a couple of hours and see his new apartment. i ask joey if its okay. his expression is of complete shock. why would i want to go see a man with out him? i cant help but break. please. let me go see him. joey looks at me as if im pathetic. he says ""you can go but your shit will be on the porch when you get back"" 

THANK GOD. ""If thats the case i'll take my stuff right now"" 

the look on his face wont leave my mind. he woudlnt let me touch any of my things and he packs my car for me. i say ""im sorry"" and he says ""no your not"" and slams his door. i hear things breaking inside and i just GTFO. 

days later i have to get my tax refund from his house. his mother called me and told me it was there and that she wouldnt say i was there (joey never left the back bedroom when his step father was home) i walk inside and cant help but shake and cry silently as i see her face. she knows what i went through. 

i find out later that joey had threatened his mother to back up what ever story he told me. that he had hit his wife and thats why she had left. he never had a job he never left the house. he took his mothers gov. check. i never saw his face again after i left. but he still sends me messages on fb. always a new profile when i block him. asking me to come back and that he is so sorry. 

it took me half a year to get to sleep. i dont know if i could ever see him again with out breaking down. he looms over me in my dreams sometimes. i think about what if i didnt get out?  sometimes the right guy can be so . SO wrong. 

TL;DR i had a boyfriend who wanted me all to himself and i escaped one lucky bitch"	t5_2t3t8	True

I'll take walks with her and hell stand on the sidewalk waiting for me to come back (still kind of in his yard) and hell either watch me not breaking eye contact, and be smiling or kind of laughing. 
he's watching my door when I'm not outside, I can see him througb
the window upstairs. The last few days he's had a friend over and they both stand outside and stare. They point directly at me and talk to eachotger and laugh and smile. When I leave in my car to the store he's standing in the same spot when I get back and you can see him squinting from far away trying to see if that is my car and when he realizes it is he gets noticeably excited and starts laughing and smiling again.
he doesn't seem mentally handicapped
he doesn't seem just shy
my boyfriend and I can tell he's getting enjoyment out

1365781459.0	1c7mi2	My mother's story	Petalsper	179	34	9	"I’m really not sure if this belongs here but I think if nothing else it serves as an example of what can happen if you just ignore bad feelings you get from someone. This is not my story personally but my mothers. It has been a while since she told me this story so please forgive me if I get some details wrong. 

This was when my mother was in College in Illinois probably in the early 70’s. Anyways my mother was at the grocery store. The store had these huge windows looking out on the parking lot and you could see pretty much everything that happened out there. While she was waiting in line she saw two very attractive girls in front of her. The way my mother describes it they were tall thin, with long beautiful hair and in general very model like. For clarity I’ll call them Blondie and Brunette. 

The girls were in front of her checking out when Brunette of pointed out the window and said, “He’s in the parking lot. Maybe we should wait inside until he leave.”

Blondie commented back something along the lines of, “No he won’t do anything here.”

Something about the way my mom told this story made it seem like perhaps the guy outside was Blondie’s boyfriend or ex-boyfriend, but I’m not sure. The girls pay and leave. My mother was watching them through the windows as they were leaving. 

The girls walk across the cross walk right in front of the guys car. He revved his car and hits her knocking Blondie down and partially running her over. By now people are noticing and the guy starts to back up but Blondie’s long, beautiful hair is caught in her grill so she is dragged back with the car. Panicking the guy drives forward again and backs up trying to get her off. He keeps doing this pretty much until her hair/ scalp rips. He then drives off. 
The whole time people are panicking and yelling at him to stop and her friend is trying to help her up. Since this was before cell phones people are trying to get the police called on the stores phone. The girl apparently ended up being alright. Hurt but nothing major just broken bones and a messed up scalp. 

My mother told me this story as a warning. If you think someone may hurt you contact the police immediately. Take all precautions. Even if you’re unsure or if you get that feeling something is off. 

I’ve read a lot of these stories and it seems like the people we hear from followed their instincts and played it safe which is what saved them. You may seem like a jerk or a weirdo for freaking out at the time but just remember if that girl had waited inside or called the police she wouldn’t have had this happen.

1364154774.0	1axgbj	"""You little bitch!"""	KaileyMcSickFuckery	198	52	31	"Okay. This happened maybe an hour ago.
I was at the park in neighborhood with my 5 year old brother. Our park is set up so there's a gazeebo at the front, and a sidewalk going up a small hill to the playground.

The playground is standard, monkey bars, slide, jungle gym, and only two swings. My brother is just learning how to push himself on the swing and I was sitting on the swing next to him, making sure he didn't hurt himself like rowdy 5 year old boys are prone to. 

A woman with two toddlers, around 3 and 4, walked up the sidewalk and to the swings. The mother politely asked me if she could use the swing I was on. I got off, and stood on the other side to watch my brother. 

The woman put the smallest one on the swing and then attempted to PICK UP MY BROTHER AND TAKE HIM OFF THE SWING. I'm a 15 year old girl, 4'11, chubby, so I'm obviously not intimidating, but I put on my tough face and said, ""What do you think you're doing?""

She looked at me, shocked, and said, "" I need this swing!"" And once again attempted to lift my brother off the swing. Okay, what the fuck, woman? You don't just put your hands on other peoples children.

I kind of karate choppped/bitch slapped her hands away to which she glared at me, grabbed my brother by the front of his shirt and ripped him off the swing and replaced him with her child. 

I picked up my brother and walked away, shouting ""**FUCK YOU, CRAZY OLD BITCH!**"", to which she replied, ""**YOU LITTLE BITCH! I WILL FUCK YOU UP YOU LITLE CUNT!**"".

So my boyfriend and I were pulling an all nighter, being the computer addicts that we are, and at about seven in the morning we decide to run to the gas station just outside of our neighborhood for some energy drinks. We pull up and park on the side of the building, away from the busy pumps and he goes in by himself to grab the drinks. As he enters i see a man at the corner of the store, leaned up against the wall, drinking something from a paper bag. He eyes him as he enters and then flicks his attention to me. I get an uneasy feeling but stay calm because i knew he shouldn't be more then a few minutes.

 Sitting here, alone, he edges closer and closer to the car, i start to get really scared and start shaking a bit.  I feel a rush of relief when my boyfriend finally returns, but i cant help but notice that the guy is still watching us. As soon as my boyfriend turns the corner towards me  the guy *starts following him.* i freeze up. i have no idea what this guy is about to do. my boyfriend walks faster, the guy keeps pace, and right as he reaches for the car door the guy starts makes a fast grabbing motion torwards his throat. i throw open my car door and start blaring the car horn. The guy scowls at me and backs up to the wall. My boyfriend jumps in the car and peels off. i can see him as we drive away, his head is down and hes muttering to himself."	t5_2t3t8	True
1344459645.0	xwhfj	We can hear you in there!	binnska	174	34	34	"When I was young, I was home sick a lot with various chronic illnesses. It meant I got to watch a lot of TV, so that was good because yay TV, but it also meant I was home alone by myself a lot. My mom couldn't miss work due to being our only provider.

Once when I was about 11 or 12, it was a particularly awful health day and I was crashed out on the couch in the living room. It was just around 8am, as I had just heard my brother's school bus drive off.

Now, as I was basically a latch-key kid, we had a set of rules about things for when my mom wasn't home. Things like if strangers call looking for mom, she's in the shower, no leaving the house when she wasn't home, and the one important to my story: if someone knocked when we weren't expecting anyone, we were supposed to not acknowledge it. This might sound a bit silly, but I was a sickly kid all by myself, and I eagerly followed the rule.

So I was watching something on TV when the doorbell started ringing. Once at first, but when I didn't acknowledge it, they started leaning on it. Then the pounding on the door. I ignored it still but was understandably a little shaken.

A few minutes of quiet followed, and then it started again, this time on the front AND back door.  They repeatedly tried each doorknob, trying to get in. I was freaking out, too scared to move. Suddenly, a loud, shrill female voice yelled ""WE CAN HEAR YOU IN THERE! We just want to talk to you about the lord!"" 

Wait- what? 

At this point, my next door neighbor, who was also home dealing with chemo sickness, came out of his apartment and chased them off. I yelled to him that there was one at the back door too, but I guess they heard me and ran off too. He knocked and I let him in. In front of my door was a dropped pile of religious pamphlets. 

He made sure I was okay and I spent the rest of the day at their place until mom came home. I'm really grateful he was there.

As for the why, I don't know. It was apparently two ""very devout"" women in the area who had harassed people a number of times, but I couldn't begin to explain why THAT was their method of attempted conversion. I seriously doubt they would have caused me any harm, but this remains one of the most bizarre moments of my entire life."	t5_2t3t8	True
1376204163.0	1k4tp1	Working nights alone can be super scary.	mega_nogen	169	25	18	" After the other day when ""The Smiling Man"" post hit the front page, I've been lurking this subreddit quite a bit and decided to share the only really scary thing that's happened to me.

I've been working nights for the last four years now, but for the last year specifically I have been working nights in a store by myself as a baker. Everyone swears up and down the stores are haunted, and yeah- it can get pretty creepy working alone all hours of the night, but I don't really believe in all that. It's mostly just getting freaked out by a creaky old building.
Anyways, it's a fairly safe job. There are alarm systems in the store that alert you if a door is opened, and managers call or come by to check on you. For the most part, I'm in the back of the house just baking and doing my thing.

So one night, I'm doing just that- baking, listening to some music, and trying not psych myself out about ghost stories and whatnot. I was working out of the smaller oven which mostly is concealed from the front doors and windows by a massive cooling rack. It's not uncommon for your managers to show up unannounced because we do work by ourselves, and they want to make sure we stay productive throughout our shifts. So when I heard the sound of the door attempting to be opened, I didn't think much of it. Until a second later when it stopped and I didn't hear anything else.
Glancing out around the rack, I tried to see outside without drawing attention to myself, because as pathetic as it is, I still get a little scared someone is going to try and break into my store one night. As a single lady working nights, you learn to be a little paranoid.

So... moving on, there's no one at the door. I assume that it's just the wind making it creak and continue on baking. Fast forward a little while its about two in the morning, and I'm up front grabbing a drink from the soda machine when I notice someone standing outside. It's obviously a man, and he's looking down at something in his hands. Yeah, it startled me, but there's a bar across the complex I work in and it just closed. I assume he walked over drunk and is on his phone or something. 
As per company policy, if someone is hanging outside the store at night, you're supposed to call the cops and have them get rid of the person. Even though it's usually just someone using the WiFi, we've been told it's a liability for the company in case that person gets robbed or hurt or whatever. So, I'm thinking, ""Alright. If he's still there in a little while, I'll call.""
I don't want to be a dick and call the cops on someone waiting for a cab, you know?
That was when he turned and looked up at me. He motioned for me to come to the window in front of where he was. I stood sort of frozen for a moment and then shook my head at him and walked to the back of house where I couldn't be seen.

I'm not going to say it didn't creep me out- it really did. But worthy of losing my mind over it? No. So I started to bake again and told myself it was just a drunk dude, and that I needed to be on the lookout.
A couple minutes later though, I heard knocking on the front door. Knowing we didn't have a truck coming that night and that if our managers didn't have a key they would just call the store, I ignored it, hoping he would leave on his own. 
At this point, I definitely considered warning him that if he didn't leave, I would call the cops. But why give someone trying to come into a closed store late at night with one chick inside a warning? He knew what he was doing, drunk or not. And after working nights this long, you learn quick that there is absolutely nothing anyone needs to say to you in an isolated area at two in the morning. 

After a moment, the knocking stopped, and I got a little worried. I texted my manager who told me to call the cops if I felt threatened, and that I should keep him posted. I checked to make sure the alarm was set, and tried to avoid front of house as much as possible. 

It was quiet for a while after that. I checked a couple of times to see if he was out front, but I didn't see him. About an hour passed, and nothing happened. I just tried to stay upbeat and focused on work.
I went to go work in the small ovens again, and it was just as I was about to put some bread in the oven that I heard knocking on the doors again.
Only this time it was really fucking loud. Insistent and angry. 
So I did what any normal person would do, and I fell to the floor and hid.
I went to reach for my phone to call the cops and realized it was charging at the other end of the cafe. I couldn't get to it without being seen because the entire front of the store is made up of huge windows. Right as I made these connections, the banging got louder. It didn't sound like he was using his hands to hit the glass anymore, it sounded like he was using something heavy to hit to the doors.

So, I'm sitting there cowering under my baker's table, desperately hoping that this guy is just trying to scare me and not break in. Or that it's my manager playing a prank on me because he knows I can get a little jumpy. Anything, really, to calm myself down. I run through my options. 
The first thing I decide, is that seen or not, I need to get to my phone. So I run, ducking the entire way, and get to it. I quickly call 911, fill in the operator, and then I call my manager who tells me he will be there as soon as he can.

This is about the point where all of my ovens decided to start going off. So thinking it would be good to avoid a giant fire in my cafe, I start to pull everything out that I can, as quickly as I can. The knocking starts to move from the front door to other windows though, and sure enough, when I look directly behind me, he's fucking standing there with his hands cupped against the glass, and he's looking at me through the glass. 
That's when I noped the fuck out, and hid in the back of the house.

After a few minutes, I assume he gave up because the knocking stopped, and I heard the sirens of the cops arrive. I let them in, gave my statement, and they told me they had checked around the entire cafe, but hadn't seen anyone. They did tell me however, that all of the tables and chairs were knocked over out front. I let them know my manager was on his way, and they left asking me to call them if anything happened again. Unfortunately there wasn't much else they could do. I saw them hang out for a while, and they left a little later with their sirens on again.

My manager finally showed up and helped me finish the bake while I told him everything that happened. The opening manager came in and asked about the patio. It was a pretty uneventful finish to a pretty scary shift.

 It was so terrifying to think about afterwards, because it would be too easy to follow me. I felt terribly exposed and alone.
The little details, like the door trying to be opened at the beginning of my shift came back to me. Things you don't know for sure are connected, but you feel like they probably are.
Maybe this guy was just super hungry or something, but it was super scary to me.

TL;dr I work nights alone as a baker and some dude tried to break in to murder me and I can only assume steal all of the delicious bread I was baking."	t5_2t3t8	True
1372037670.0	1gxwb5	Creeped in a book store line with my dad 20 feet away	lpgirl	169	26	15	"I was standing in a book store line, waiting to pay for the 3 books I had picked up. I was 12, and my dad and I had driven to the mall that day just for random odds and ends. Here's the thing: i've always looked older than my age by a considerable amount. By the time I was 12, I was often mistaken for being 15, 16, or even as being older than my older sister. So I was waiting in the line when the guy ahead o me turns around. He's built like a tank, maybe 6,4"" or around there, really buff too. He turns around a strikes up a conversation. C=him, M=me.
C: Hey babe.
M: No answer.
C: What books do you have?
At this point, I was annoyed, but I figured I may as well play along so I don't piss him off.
M: *this book* *this book* and *this book*
C: Cool.
M: Yep.
C: So why is a pretty girl like you here all alone?
Remember, I'm 12 and this guy is mid-late twenties. I was freaked.
M: Uh...
Then the guy grabs my wrist pretty agressively.
C; Why don't we go outside for a second? You can check out my car.
M: No, sorry, I don't want-
C:Don't worry, it'll be fun!
So he literally starts pulling me towards the door. I'm pulling back, to get away, but no one around me was doing anything. I was too scared to make any noise, I was just so scared. Then my dad, who had been 10m away the whole time, came up. D= Dad.
D: What are you doing! Get away from my daughter!
C: Sir, what are you talking about? This is my child!
D: What the fuck?
They get in a yelling match, and I pull free. I ran to the nearest store clerk and told them some man had just grabbed me. When the creeper saw the clerk coming over, he bolted out the door. No one ever caught him. I don't know if he was just making a last ditch effort to take me when he pretended I was his daughter or if he was seriously deranged, but I still shiver to think what might have happened if I had been alone. I go shopping all the time on my own and every time I can't go without worrying whether I'll get kidnapped."	t5_2t3t8	True
1371237949.0	1gcv9l	I have to pee now. Do you understand?	kaunis	191	45	40	"My lunch break started. i wandered over to the park in the city in my pink t shirt and floor length white flouncy skirt. Perfect for the warm spring day. I picked a bench in the shade, opened my lunch and started to nibble on the lettuce in my salad while waiting for my lunch buddy Marc.

From my left approached someone. I looked over expecting the usual: Homeless men asking for change, women handing out fliers, children chasing pigeons. 

Nope. It was a crazed looking man that stood right in front of me and said ""um... Breasts."" Pause. Then ""um... What's your name"" 

I should have left right then, but I gave him a fake name. Then he sat down on the other side of my bench, saying ""you know what, I'm hungry too. Where'd you get that?""

At this point I figured he was a little insane and maybe wanted to just talk and wouldn't mention my breasts again. 

""18th and Market"" 

""Where's that?""

""Over there"" I pointed.

""Oh. So what are you doing?""

""Meeting a friend for lunch""

""Wow that's great...""
Then he leans over the bench divider and says in the most creepy, low, hoarse tone
"" I have to pee now. Do you understand that?"" 

I was just so confused and freaked out and just wanted to eat my stupid salad in the sun that I left the park. I should have clobbered him or something.

1369324876.0	1ewr2r	Footsteps on the Roof	uhuhshesaid	172	27	14	"A few years ago I was back home visiting my family. We had an nice older house with a large square living room. That night my mom was out of town and so it was me (female), my little brother, my big brother and his fiancé. All of us grown ups. 

We were having a great time hanging out and catching up with each other. We weren't drinking/smoking anything, and the evening ran on and on. Around 3:30am I was in the middle of saying something when suddenly there were 4 incredibly loud bangs that ran across the roof of the house. And when I say incredibly I mean the house shook. Clearly this person was not trying to be subtle. 

We all stopped what we were doing and shared that creepy silent ""shit has gotten real"" look that adults tend to get when shit has, in fact, gotten real. 

My younger brother, being the most reasonable one, grabbed our phone and called the police. And then for some reason, thrust the phone at me. I talked to the dispatcher, told her we had all heard footsteps across our roof, and clearly this person wanted us to know they was there. It might also be worth mentioning that our roof is quite large across the living room portion and whoever it was only took only 4 steps to get across it-- so we don't feel like this is just a kid playing a prank. 

She tells us to make sure everything is locked up (of course it's not and that is a terrifying ordeal to run to all the windows and doors). Half of me wanted to peer out and the other half was terrified of what I could see. We opted to shut the curtains and waited for the police to show. They came and saw that our ladder had been taken out of the shed (should've locked that shit up) and used to get up on the roof. On the other side (where the footsteps had ended) the rose bushes were trampled as if someone had jumped down on them. 

Nothing else was heard for the rest of the night. But we all had a slumber party in the living room, none of us wanting to retire to our separate rooms. 

A few months later (not related) my mom sold the house and moved into a condo. I have to say, I'm much more relaxed when visiting her these days.

1344916374.0	y6nlq	There's a crazy clown in the house.	SwillFish	163	17	27	"I've posted this story once before in a lot less detail in a different thread, but never here. It is 100% true. It happened back in the late 1980's when I was home one summer on break from college.

About two years prior, my dad had purchased an old house with the intention of eventually tearing it down to build a new home. The house was built in 1916, and like most homes built in that era, it had a really unconventional floor plan. There was a central living room and kitchen like any normal home, but the three bedrooms were more akin to separate apartments. Each had its own separate outside entrance, a private bathroom, and a door that led to the common area living room and kitchen. Perhaps the place was originally intended to be a boarding house or something? I really don't know. The other thing that was a little creepy about the house was that is was all wood. The ceilings, walls and floors were all brown and nothing was ever painted or plastered.

My dad was a pretty cool guy. While he was waiting for permits and financing, he let three of my friends live there for free in exchange for ""watching"" the place. They had a lot of parties, but my dad didn't care as long as none of the neighbors complained. I went to a few parties there myself when I was lucky enough to be home from college. 

Eventually two of my friends moved out, leaving my one buddy there to watch the mostly empty house on his own. He was not the type of person to be afraid of living alone in a half empty house, so he was fine with the situation.

I'm at home one afternoon when the phone rings. It's my buddy and he sounds terrified. He tells me to call the police and to meet him out in front of the driveway of the house, but under no conditions, go in. I ask him why, and he tells me that there is a crazy clown in the house.  Apparently, he was sick with the flu in bed for the previous two days. When he finally felt well enough to go into the kitchen to get something to eat, he runs face to face with a crazy woman dressed in a clown suit and make-up who starts screaming at him. It was then that he ran out of the house and called me in a panic from a nearby gas station. 

I call the police and then drive over to the house which was about two miles away. I find my buddy on the sidewalk out front and he's really shaken up. I ask him to describe what he saw and he keeps saying that there is a crazy clown woman in the house. I ask for more specific details and he describes her as dressed in a white clown suit with red makeup smeared all over her face. He is still a little sick, so he looks really bad and, honestly, he is really freaking me out as well. There was no way in hell that I was going to go into that house to investigate his story.

After what seems like an eternity, a cop shows up. My buddy tells him the same exact story. The cop then goes into the house while we wait outside. After about five minutes he emerges escorting a crazy clown woman who looks exactly as my friend described her. She has wild, unkempt, brown hair and is wearing this weird, baggy, one piece, all white body jumper suit that is kind of styled like [this outfit](http://magsrags.myshopify.com/products/jeanne-marc-80s-vintage-jumpsuit-retro-futuristic-s-xs). What was really disturbing though is her face. She had a tube of lipstick which she crudely spread red all over her cheeks in a failed attempt I suppose to make them look rosy.

Although we were both freaked out, the cop thought it was hilarious. The clown woman claimed it was her house and then accused us of being on drugs and trespassing on her property. When the cop told her to get in the back of his squad car, she warned him that she had powerful friends in ""Tinsel Town"" who would have him fired. 

When he comes back to talk to us, he tells us he can't arrest her for breaking and entering because the house is half abandoned. He said the best he could do was drive her a few blocks away and hope that she doesn't wander back. This, of course, freaks us out even more. Fortunately though, when they run a background check on her, it turns out she has an outstanding warrant and would be going to jail instead. That is the last time we saw her.

When we go back into the house, we find all kinds of crazy stuff written on the kitchen cabinets in the same red lipstick she rubbed all over her face. There was also some ten day old fish in the fridge that my friend never got around to eating that she cooked on the stove and ate. 

The really scary thing though was that this crazy woman was in the same house with my friend for at least a day while he was sick and semi delirious in bed with a fever. She was probably harmless, but who knows what she would have done if she stumbled upon him while he was sleeping. His door was unlocked the entire time. Fortunately, she never did as far as we know.

One of the things she wrote on the cabinets in lipstick was her name. While I'm not allowed to disclose it here, I Googled it and found a mugshot that was taken of her some years later. [Here it is](http://i.imgur.com/AlkVE.jpg)."	t5_2t3t8	True
1343772348.0	xgzz6	Bloodied Woman Barges In	Injunwerks	197	51	38	"""Prowler at the Window"" was not only my first post here, but it is also the very first time I've ever submitted anything I've written to the general public. I never thought of myself as being adept at writing but I have always enjoyed it. Thanks so much for the supporting comments and requests for more. I had no idea that anyone would like it. 

Strange as it was, it was an honest experience. The bottom was a great source of experiences. To be honest, it was probably a lot more sinister than I realized because I was young and naive. Having grown older, it isn't a place where I would want to raise a family in today's world. Back then was a more innocent time. My memories of the bottom are both sweet and sour, but it was familiar. It was home.

Still, I got to see some pretty terrific and occasionally terrifying things when we lived there.  I could tell any of several stories to you: there was the teenager who started lighting fires all over the place one summer who got caught at the wrong house and nearly got beat to death. There was the long haired dude who would break into houses and steal food and panties (he was never caught). There was the kid whose family lived four houses down the road from me that shot his neighbor in the back of the head with a .357. There was the swamp monster thing that killed a bunch of dogs and chickens. There was the snake caught on a trot line that was confiscated by authorities. There was the kid who rode the school bus with me who saw a UFO and was the subject of a television documentary. There were the guys who went noodling and pulled a body out of a hole instead of a fish. We discovered an old, long forgotten slave cemetery after finding some holes dug in the ground and scattered bones. It was a different kind of community to say the least. I'm happy to share these stories if anyone wants me to do so. 

This particular incident happened just after school had let out for the summer vacation. It would have been early to mid-June of 77 or 78. I would have been 9 or 10 years old at this time. Of course it was raining. It was a steady but moderate downpour. My grandfather would have called it a “toad floater.” It got dark early because of the storm clouds, a dusky wet twilight at around 5pm. It was an even gloomier day because I was stuck inside the house. 

In those days before cable television, we only got three channels on the television and at 5pm, the news was on all three channels. My mother was just beginning to start cooking supper. She'd placed a pot of red beans on the stove to cook after soaking them all day and she was in the process of cutting up potatoes to fry when we heard the truck. 

Our property was bordered on the south side by FM2797 that stopped in a dead end about a quarter mile past our house. At the southwest corner of our land was the entrance to Plaza Drive, this is the road that went down to the bottoms. At the northwest corner of our property, the road made a 90 degree turn and followed along our property line to the bottom. This 90 degree corner was the source of many hours of excitement. About once every three months, someone either entering or leaving the bottom would try to take that corner too fast and would end up either stuck in the field or (if I was lucky) they would actually get sideways in the turn and would roll their car if they were going fast enough. Don’t get me wrong, I didn’t want to see people get hurt, but it was always great fun to watch the tow truck come out and roll the car back onto its wheels and then haul it off. The tow truck driver would normally pick up any of the larger objects that fell out of the car, but they were never diligent about it. I would go over to the corner after the tow truck was gone and look for whatever they’d missed or just not taken the time to retrieve. My main reason for the search was for change that may have fallen out. This meant an extra candy bar to split with my brother (Mom always made me share) or a new Hot Wheel. There was always something left behind, a shoe, a hairbrush, a baby bottle, etc. I found a box of bullets one. Another time I found a Hustler magazine that opened up a whole new world to me. So a car wreck at the corner was always a cause for excitement. 

On this particular night, the truck was going way too fast. We could hear it long before it was anywhere near the house. I watched down the road toward the bottom and could see the flashes of light from the headlights as they bounced up and down in the distance. My mother turned to me at this point and said “Who is that?” We knew most of the cars or trucks by the sound of their engine, but someone driving this fast was a rarity; especially in the rain. Plaza drive was loose gravel over compacted clay and was slicker than snot whenever it got wet. After it was soaked through, it turned into a paste that sucked at your tires and left ruts, but the road had been built up over the years so the water would run off it before it had a chance to soak in. This resulted in a rounded road more than a flat road, which was fine when it was dry but more difficult to navigate when wet. 

“I don’t know who it is. It sure is loud,” I replied with my nose pressed against the window. Then the lights got brighter and the truck came into view. It was a 68 or so Chevy short bed pickup that was jacked up with big mudder tires on it. It was a very bright red color with a blue driver side door and a white tailgate. “It’s Billy!” I told mom. She muttered under her breath about him killing someone one of these days. She was beating eggs into cornbread mix extra vigorously, but kept on muttering, “He knows there’s kids here.”

I told her that he was going way too fast. By now, I had my nose and both hands pressed to the window. Billy was in front of our house and there weren’t any signs of him slowing. As he passed the house, I watched for brake lights and sure enough; about 100 feet from the 90 degree turn (much too late to even slow down much), the tail lights lit up. As I watched, the lights lifted a little in the air as the front brakes brought the nose down and then suddenly, the those brake lights went about ten feet into the air and disappeared. Then I saw one of the head lights and then the brake lights again, rolling over each other in the rain. It finally came to a stop on one of the sides but I couldn’t tell which side. As I was watching and was taking all of this in, my mother half shouted “Good Lord, what was that?” She’d heard the booms and crunches. She came running over to me wiping her hands with a dishrag. 

She came up behind me and looked out the window and as we both watched, the lower of the two tail lights flickered and went out. Then I heard mom trotting over to use the phone. She picked it up and listened for a moment before dialing. We shared a party line with two other families. One of the families had a teenager about six years older than me whose ear was practically glued to the phone. It was seldom that mom or dad was able to use the phone without having to wait for her to finish talking and hang up. Mom was lucky this time and had an open line. 

Mom called the police and was telling them what happened and where to go. I was watching the truck. I couldn’t really see anything but that one tail light and the head lights shining on the weeds in front of it. I was watching to see if someone was going to crawl out but never saw anyone. 

As I was watching the truck, my mother went to the closet to get a raincoat and an umbrella. She was shrugging into the raincoat and giving me instructions at the same time. I was not to leave the house and I was to keep my brother from touching any of the hot items on the stove if he woke up. Mom started to leave and then said “flashlight, I need a flashlight” and went to the utility room at the back of the house to get a flashlight. I’d just turned back to the truck when the front door banged open and a woman half stumbled and half fell into the house. 

She was skinny with big boobs. That was all I noticed at first; being the curious, inquisitive young man that I was. To tell the truth, I didn’t really know anything about boobs at the time; except that everyone at school always talked about them so I figured they must be important. 

Then I saw the blood. Her whole head was covered in blood. Her hair that I initially thought was brown was actually blonde but bloody. It was a short, choppy type of cut and I could see that one of her hoop earring had been torn out of an ear and it was bleeding. Her nose was fat and at an angle. Her lips were bleeding and she had blood in her teeth. Her forehead had several small cuts and gashes that were all oozing. She had a cut under an eye that my dad would have called a rabbit. Her neck was bleeding too.

She was wearing black pants and a light blue button shirt that had a frilly lace collar. A waitress uniform I realized when I saw the name tag. It had one corner broken off and was hanging at an angle with blood staining her shirt behind it. One leg of the black pants was ripped from about mid-thigh down to below her knee and I could see bits of a bloody leg. She had blue kicks that were the same color as her shirt, but the whole back of one was cut and there was blood there too. 

As I was drinking all of this in, my mom came running up the hall wanting to know what happened. She saw the woman and said “Oh My Lord, Look at you!” She had the woman sit at the table and went into her doctor mode. She got a bowl of water and sat it on the table with a roll of paper towels and began mopping the blood off the woman’s face. She was asking one question after the other, but never stopped long enough to let the woman talk. As she got up to get a glass of water for the woman, my father walked in from work. 

He started to ask about the blood all over the door and then saw the woman. Mom looked at him and told him that the police were coming. As dad was talking to mom, someone started beating on the door. It was Mr. Laird who lived on the other side of the road from us, up from the corner. He said that he saw the accident and by the time he got to the truck, it was empty. He wanted to know if there was anything he could do. 

The woman started crying and began telling us about how Billy had beat her. She said that he’d used the small end of a fishing rod and had beat her until she bled. I hissed at this because I could relate. Just the summer before I was riding my bicycle in front of our house and some kids drove by and yelled something at me. My response was to grab a rock and throw it at them. I was pretty handy with a rock, but the car was going too fast and I never had a chance. Worse though, my father saw what I’d done and came striding out to me. He asked me what I'd done and I told him that I hadn’t done anything. Then he said that he saw me throw the rock. He thought I’d lied to him, but I meant that I hadn’t done anything to make the kids yell at me. 

I had a white fiberglass whip antenna with a big orange flag mounted on the back of my bike. It was kept in the holder with a screw that was long gone, but if I didn’t jump a ramp or ride over anything too bumpy, it stayed in the holder. Before I could explain, dad grabbed it and grabbed me by the upper arm and gave me two quick swats. I was wearing shorts and it stung like nothing I’d ever experienced before. Then he made me walk my bicycle back to the barn and put it away. I didn’t need to be having fun on a bicycle if I was going to lie to him. So I knew all about how it felt to get a stripe or two. 

She told dad that her name was Margaret, which I thought was strange because her name tag clearly said “Molly” on it. But I knew better than to chime in when adults were talking so I didn’t say anything. She said that she and Billy had been seeing each other off and on for the past six months or so. He’d picked her up after work that afternoon and they’d gone back to his place to get high. He wanted to go get some more, but she wanted to go home and change first and he got mad and went crazy and started slapping her around. She told us that she got mad and slapped him back and that was when he punched her in the face. She said that it knocked her across the bed and out into the hall and she started to run out the door but he was behind her and pushed her and she fell into his coffee table. She told us that he came into the living room with the short end of the fishing rod and just started hitting her. 

I could see my dad getting angry because his jaw was tightened up. I looked at Mr. Laird, and he was practically shaking; his lips pressed together so hard that they turned white. He’d lost his wife two summers earlier in a boating accident and was left with a 14 year old daughter and twin 8 year girls. He was ready to murder. 

Margaret went on to say that she kicked him in the balls and tried to run out the door but before she could get outside, he tackled her and they fell into the kitchen. He landed on the floor and she ended up on top of him. She told us that she tried to get up and grabbed the oven handle for support; but it just popped open and she fell back on him again, but that’s when she saw the iron skillet inside the oven. She said that she grabbed it and hit him in the head with it and when he tried to fight back she hit him again. She said that he bucked his hips and hit her in the ribs and then she just started hitting him over and over and over again. “He’s prolly dead….. I hope he’s dead.” You could practically see the pity rolling off my mothers’ face. 

They talked for a few more minutes and as my mother continued to clean the blood away, my father and Mr. Laird decided to go check on Billy to make sure he was still alive and not laying in the floor with what Mr. Laird called a “broke haid.”

As soon as they walked out the door, Margaret changed. At first, she wanted to get her jacket out of the truck but my mom wouldn’t let her leave. She told Margaret that it would be fine and that the police would be here any moment. Then Margaret said her purse was in the truck and she needed to get her purse. My mother started to tell her that it was OK too, but Margaret insisted that her medicine was in the purse and that she needed to take her medicine. My mom is as good as they get, she can be a little backwards sometimes, but she’s not an idiot. Suspicious now, she asked Margaret what medicine she needed. Margaret stalled, it was obvious that she was searching for a suitable answer. Suddenly she looked up and actually had half a smile as she held up a single finger and said “My inhaler! I need my inhaler.” Then almost comically, she lost the smile and slumped in the chair and started breathing in a raspy manner.

My mother, bless her heart; is one of those old souls who looks for the best in any situation. The thought of lying to someone, especially in the time of a crisis was beyond her and for some odd reason; she never could believe that anyone would lie to her. Yes, I took advantage of this on more than one occasion. I was a kid; not a saint!

My mother got this worried look on her face; she was obviously torn between leaving me and my brother alone with a strange woman and letting the woman suffer. She looked between Margaret and me and my brother asleep on the sofa and the window and back to Margaret. By this time, Margaret was blowing like a race horse. Between gasps of breath she told my mother not to worry and that she’d be back in a minute. My mother and I watched as she got up and limped to the door, leaving tracks of blood from her cut foot. We watched out the window as she stumbled across our yard to the road and toward the truck. At that moment, the phone rang and I watched as mom talked to the caller. From the tone of her voice, I knew it was my dad. She started to tell him about Margaret going back to the truck, but stopped when he started shouting. I could hear his voice through the tinny speaker all the way across the room. When I looked back to the truck, I couldn’t see Margaret, but I did see the police arrive and I said so to mom. She was finishing the call with a lot of OKs and nods of the head. When she hung up the phone, she went over and locked the door and told me to come away from the window. 

My father and Mr. Laird drove back into sight, but instead of pulling into our yard, they went to where the police were looking over the truck. It was pretty dark by now and all I could see were the lights from my dad’s car, lights from the police car and that one tail light on Billy's truck. I could also see two flashlights shining all over the truck and then inside the truck and then into the surrounding trees and bushes. I watched my father run up to the police and I knew he was shouting because both of the flashlights whipped up and over to him. He was pointing back to his car. Then I watched the flashlights start bobbing up and down and back and forth as the policeman went running towards my dad’s car. Then I saw the inside light come on and the flashlight beams shining on two men in the back seat. One of the policemen went back to the police car and sat inside it for a minute and then went back to my dad’s car. Nothing else happened for a long time. Then I heard the sirens.

I watched as a glow of light appeared on top of the hill where FM2797 went to town. First I saw only the bright white light glow of the headlights of a car coming from town and I could hear the siren getting louder and louder and then I saw the red flashes. It was another police car rushing to the scene of the accident. By this time, I was sharing the window with my mother who was telling me to stay away from the window five minutes earlier. As the car got to the bottom of the hill and the entrance of Plaza Drive, I saw that it was a big van. It was an ambulance! This was the first time I’d seen one that wasn’t on television. It had lights all over the top of it. It stopped behind my dad’s car and two men jumped out of the back with a stretcher that had a pole with a bag on it. They rolled it to my dad’s car and because of all of the lights, I could see everything now. There were pulling a man out of the back seat and laying him on the stretcher. My first thought was that Mr. Laird had been hurt, but then I saw him walk around from the other side of the car. I had no idea who was on that stretcher. 

After just a minute or two, the men rolled the stretcher back to the ambulance and loaded it inside. I remember thinking how neat it was that they didn’t have to lift it up, they just pushed it into the back and the legs folded up. They crawled in behind the stretcher and shut the doors. The ambulance turned around and started the siren again and headed back into town. After a few more minutes, a tow truck appeared and I got to watch them pull Billy’s truck back onto its wheels. Then the man moved the tow truck around to the back of Billy’s truck and raised the bed of the truck into the air and then hooked up some more chains and drove away. Billy’s truck looked weird, like it had a big hump in the middle or something. This left my dad and Mr. Laird talking with the police. They were all standing in front of the police car in the rain; the police taking notes on a little pad he pulled from his shirt pocket. Then the police both shook my dad’s hand then Mr. Laird’s and everyone got back into their cars. My father dropped Mr. Laird at his house and then came back home. 

My mother was full of questions and tried start asking them the moment my dad stepped in the door, but he was covered in blood. She dropped her spatula and asked what had happened. Before my dad could even open his mouth she asked if he was OK. He held up his hands and said that it wasn’t his blood and then glanced over to where I was staring with my mouth hanging open and my eyes as big as a dinner plate. He told my mother to let him take a shower and then he’d tell her everything. She started to protest, but relented after a moment as my dad went to their bedroom to get clean clothes. My mother finished cooking and had the table set by the time he was out of the shower. 

We were all sitting there waiting when he came and sat with us. He said that Billy’s been shot bad. Three times; once in the leg, once in the shoulder and once in the stomach. He went on to say that the paramedics said it wasn’t life threatening, but he’d lost a lot of blood and would be in the hospital for a few days. My dad said the police called his family and that his brother was going to watch his house and take care of his dogs. Then he started telling mom about what happened. 

He and Mr. Laird went to Billy’s house and when they got there it was a mess. He said that from the way it looked, Margaret had been telling the truth. They called his name and heard a moan in the back bedroom. When they went to the bedroom, they knew something was wrong. Billy was sitting in a pool of blood. His right hand was tied to the bed frame with zip ties. His head had a knot the size of a softball just above his forehead. Billy told them that he’d met Molly (that was what he called her) a few weeks before at a dance club in Liberty (Liberty is the county seat, just across the river from the bottom but you had to drive about twenty miles to get there by car). They’d met at a dance hall. They’d been out a few times and he’d promised to take her some place nice the next time he was home. Billy did oilfield work and made a very good salary, but he drank and partied most of it away each week.

She was evidently waiting for him when he got home this afternoon. Billy told my father that he’d thought it was strange that she was at his house without a car but invited her inside and had just taken a shower and was getting dressed when she attacked him. He’d been bent over to get his boots from under the bed and she hit him with the cast iron frying pan. He said that when he woke up he’d been dragged to the living room and she was trying to tie his feet together with a belt. He said that he kicked her away and got to his feet but was too dizzy and she was going crazy. She kept asking him where his money was. She knew he didn’t trust banks and he’d told her that he always cashed his checks on the way home each Friday. 

He said that he tried to get to his feet and she saw that he was still dizzy and came at him again with the frying pan he was able to fend her off and grabbed her legs and pulled her to the floor when she kicked him in the head. He said that they wrestled around the living room for a minute and she finally got loose and ran to his bedroom and locked the door. He kept a .22 revolver on his nightstand and she grabbed that and shot him in the stomach through the closed door. He said he fell and when she heard him fall she unlocked the door and came out and held the gun to his head and demanded his money. 

Billy said that he grabbed at the gun and she shot him in the shoulder and then while they were both fighting for the gun, she shot him in the leg. He got the gun away from her, but before he could do anything she’d grabbed the frying pan and hit him in the head again. When he awoke again, she was in the bathroom going through the pockets of his dirty jeans. She’d left the pistol on the bed and he grabbed it and was going to shoot her, but missed because he was using his left hand and was still dizzy. He told her that he was going to kill her and started trying to get out of the zip ties. Molly ran out of the bathroom and he kicked at her, but he heard her run down the stairs and then he heard his truck start. He said he tried to get up, but got dizzy and fell again and the next sound he heard was my father calling his name. 

Margaret or Molly disappeared that night. The police questioned my father the next day to weigh his story and Mr. Lairds story to see if they jived with Billy’s version of the story. Mr. Laird stopped by a few days later and told my father that one of his friends who was on the police force told him that they’d gone to her place of employment, but nobody knew anything. She had missed her shift for the last two days and nobody knew anything about her. They found a purse in the truck with almost $3000 in it and another gun and some other random items, but they had no clues about who she was or where she was from. Billy lost his spleen and was off work for about three months. His truck was a loss too. He kept the bullets they pulled out of him in a big orange pill bottle. He even showed them to me once. 

Sorry if this is too long or anti-climactic. This is a vivid memory for me on several levels. I got to actually see a wreck as it happened that night. I got to see an ambulance in action for the first time. We had a dangerous woman barge into our house and drip blood all over the place. I knew someone who got shot. I got to see the scars and bullets. When you’re ten years old, these things stick with you. 

Now who wants to hear about the kid who lived four houses down from me? He was the one who shot his neighbor. I even have a newspaper article about that incident. Let me know…

1356849796.0	15nwqf	The Men in Masks	XXXII	183	43	22	"The scariest moment of my life occurred when I was age [10 M] and in 4th grade. The reason I remember that so distinctly was because the incident happened a week before my birthday in March of the year 2003. The clarity of the 15 minute or so ordeal has stuck with me to this day, and at the time it really messed me up for about 5 years.  After this event, I told my friend who was immediately intrigued, and he was the one who suggested to post it in this subreddit.

The day that turned into a horror story for me started off on a rather exciting note. My parents informed me that for the first time ever I would be staying home alone for a little while since they were going to a party until midnight, and my younger brother who was about 9 was going to sleepover at his friend's house a few blocks away. Now this probably doesn't sound like much, but let me tell you to a fourth grader that kind of independence seems incredible.

Evening comes, and I remember spend most of the night from 6-10pm playing GameCube without my parents enforcing their usual limits. Now before I get into the part where my night went downhill, allow me to give some background information on where I lived. My neighborhood in southeast Michigan was filled with mostly middle/upper-class homes and was spread out fairly spaciously. It isn't like giant 4 acre country plots-- but there is a good 100 yards in between houses. Enough room for privacy, but close enough to feel like a community.  I lived in a 3 level home about 4 minutes into the subdivision from a main road.

So at 10pm my developing self-control told me I should probably stop playing video game and head upstairs for some rest.  I brushed my teeth and decided to read in bed until I got tired. After 10 minutes of reading, the chime of the doorbell suddenly snapped me out of my peaceful state. I lay in bed for a second, and then cautiously walked out of my room. I stood on the landing of the top floor peering down into the darkness of the main floor and I jumped as the doorbell rang two more times. My young mind was racing and I was thinking of all of the possibilities of who it could be. Was it my parents coming home early? They would have used the garage, right? Was it brother's friend who lived next door? Well it seemed kind of late for that...

I didn’t turn on the light to the stairway, but instead slowly started to descend the stairs to go to the door. My stairs are 5 feet to the left of the front door and when I was halfway down them I could clearly look out the decorative half-circle of glass that is on top of the door.  What I saw gave me one of those moments where you can feel your whole body to flush with hot blood as the adrenalin kicks in and your heart rate rapidly accelerates.

Facing the front door were three men in masks. I only glanced for a second but they are ingrained in my memory forever. All three masks were grotesque Halloween style, with wiry hair sticking out in all directions on the back.  In a split second I ran back up the stairs debating what to do. This was pre-cellphones so I couldn't call my parents, and I foolishly thought at the time the police would be mad or wouldn't believe such a young kid dialing 911.

I crept into my upstairs bathroom that was directly over the front door to get another look the men in the masks and I remember shaking from fear. Sense was quickly leaving me, and I mistakenly turned the light on in the bathroom. I crawled to the blinds and I pushed one up to get a view; the three men were still standing there, but I also saw a forth masked person crouched underneath a large pine tree in my front yard, holding an object I didn't immediately recognize. (Over the years I have speculated either a camera or firearm but never knew for sure).  However in my haste, the slot of light streaming out of the window quickly caught their attention and they gazed up at me. 

I'm sure my small figured was outlined by the light, and this led them to start banging on the door and beckoning me to come down. I stood there with tears streaming down my face, me looking down at the four figures in masks through a gap in the blinds, them staring right back at me. Suddenly they left the front door and went by the side of the house. I ran to my room turning off all the lights and huddling under my desk in hiding. I could hear the motion light by the sliding glass door facing my backyard clicking on and off over the next 15 minutes but I didn't dare look outside. I braced myself to hear pounding on the downstairs back windows, and at any moment it felt like I would hear glass shattering and them barging inside. Crying, shivering, not feeling safe inside my own house had to be some of the worst 15 minutes of my life, especially at such a young age. 

Thankfully, after a while the motion light shut off for good. There was no trace of them. My parent came home to me wedged in between the wall and the bed in the guest room, eyes wide with fear. I told them what happened and my dad explained to me there wasn't really any evidence or anything for the police to track.

For a few years I became super protective of my brother, and wouldn't let him go outside alone for fear of the masked men. I thankfully never had any other encounters, but it still fucked me up pretty bad for quite a while as stated above. 

I enjoy this subreddit in almost a masochist (Def: A willingness or tendency to subject oneself to unpleasant or trying experience for pleasure) type fashion because of that moment in my life, I hope you all liked the retelling. Thanks for reading.

1354706073.0	14bgfv	A day at the park 	lavenderKisses	173	28	16	"Age: 15 Gender: female

Six years ago I had the scare of my life.  When I was fifteen I had gotten my first job working at McDonald's. When I wasn't at school I was at work; I hardly had a day off. I didn't complain because my mom was a single parent and she had to work and raise two kids at the same time. A lot of the times she could barely make ends meet. So when my ex-stepdad called and said he could hire me, I immediately took the job. Each payday I would make sure to help out my mom with bills or whatever she needed, and whatever was left of it I would spend the rest  or save it for another time. I didn't mind having most of my money being spent for things like that, I was just glad I could help out my mom. 

In the beginning of October I had a rare weekend off.I remember that  I was thankful for it because as much as I loved the money, working at McDonald's can be very draining. Anyway, it was a Saturday afternoon and I was just lazing around the apartment in my pajamas watching tv when my little sister came in the living room and tackled me. I admit she was being pretty annoying. 

 ""I'm bored,"" she whined.

She wouldn't stop saying that and it was getting on my nerves. Dealing with a hyper nine year old wasn't good when your tired. I tried telling her to ""go away"" and ""leave me alone"" but sadly that didn't work and eventually I caved in. So I decided to take her to the park that was nearby so she would stop being as annoying. She was  pleased with my decision and was pretty excited to go. I went to my room got dressed, brushed my hair. I then  asked my mom if it was okay to head out the the park. When she told us that it was fine as long as we got home before dark, we left. (It was 3 pm at the time. )

The park wasn't that far from where we lived. It was about a 15 minute walk. I say 15 minutes because the town where we lived at was very hilly. A lot if the streets have pretty steep hills and whatnot. Form where we lived You could see the park on top of a hill. It was basically two streets over form the huge apartment complex in which we lived. Climbing the hill or walking on the street was pretty difficult and dangerous. But luckily for us there were these old cement steps we climbed instead. When we got to the park my sister made a beeline towards the slides, I decided to go on the swings. Eventually my sister got tired of the slides and came to join me. 

For a good while we had fun. It was nice spending time with each other without getting on each others nerves. Eventually my arms got really tired so I took a break and relaxed a for a little bit. Sitting there on the swing I decided to look at my surroundings when I noticed something that made me very uneasy; a middle aged man staring at us. His hair was was starting grey and he was wearing a dirty white t-shirt and jeans. He looked very out of place. There were no other kids at the park so he couldn't have been a parent and just the way he stared was fucking creepy. Following my gut instinct, I told my sister it was time to go. She was pretty upset at first that is until she saw the man too. Thankfully our mom was a good parent and taught us at a very young age what to do in case we encountered a stranger. 

I grabbed my sisters hand, and as we started to leave the park, the mans eyes were following us. I tried not to notice but it was pretty damn hard not to. It felt like forever until we reached those steps and when we did I decided to look back to see if he was there. Sure enough he was but he was following us and to make matters worse he was jogging towards us. I felt my heartbeat quicken as I tightened my hold on my sisters hands and sprinted down the stairs. Because we were holding each others hands  we almost fell down quite a few times but that didn't stop us one bit. The man seemed pretty close; close enough to hear his ragged breathing which pushed us to to run even faster. 

I don't know how we did it but we managed to get down the stairs safely and uninjured. But the man was still chasing us, We didn't want run home, we didn't want him to know where we lived. And we didn't want some possible pedophile to stalk us. Se went to the next best place.Luckily for us, we knew this lady who lived right by the stairs. We made a mad dash for her house and knocked on her door. Thankfully she opened the door and saw the look of panic on our faces. She saw the man running towards us and  promptly let us in. When we looked out her window the man came to a complete stop and glared at us for about five minutes and then headed back the way he came. We stayed at the lady's house for a good while until we felt that it was safe to go back home. 

I think we were really lucky. I don't to know what might have happened if that man had  got us on that day, and frankly I really don't want to know.
  
TL;DR went to the park with my little sister. We then saw a creepy man who chased us until we found safety form a lady we knew.

So i went with my friends and we had our fun a few drinks some dancing and more drinks.
 
The whole time i was there i was talking to this guy named Michael. He was buying me drinks and overall seemed like a nice guy. After the last drink i had i started feeling dizzy like i was going to pass out, so my friends decided to take me home. Michael insisted we stay longer and that my friends go dance and drink more while he took care of me. Thankfully one of my friends was sober enough to know that this guy was off. She told him no and continued pulling me toward the car and putting me in, I fell asleep.

 My friend Janet Told me the next morning that Michael was offering to *pay* them for me. He was going to pay them to leave me there with him to do god knows what to me."	t5_2t3t8	True

If you read my post ""If Someone Tries to Kidnap You, Shout 'Fire,'"" then you know that my dad would take us in his 18 wheeler across the eastern US (mostly so he didn't have to unload the truck, because he was a lazy asshole). Anyway, I went with him one summer, and we stopped at a Burger King to eat. I forget where it was, but it was either in Kentucky, Virginia, or West Virginia. I nearly got hit in the parking lot by some douche, which was bad enough, but the real creepy shit went down once we were inside. I ordered a kid's meal with a Dr. Pepper. The cashier was this weird redneck looking dude. I remember taking a sip of my drink a little after sitting down, and it tasting weird, but I had a mouthful of food at the time, so I didn't pay much attention to it. Now, ordinarily, I will CHUG anything caffeinated and/or carbonated, but for some reason, something told me not to this time. After I finished eating, I took another sip- it was DEFINITELY not Dr. Pepper. I told my dad that it didn't taste like it; he tasted it, replied ""it's not,"" then went and yelled at the creepy-looking redneck cashier. The manager fired him on the spot. I later learned in my teenage years that the flavor was that of very cheap beer. So, some creepy redneck, likely a pedophile, tried to get a nine year old boy drunk in a Burger King.

1366626328.0	1cutqk	Perverts in the student center.	icracknuts	189	49	45	"My last post got some positive feedback so I figued I'd share another strange story with you guys.

This story happened last fall, and what happened actually really upset me. My college has a ""student center"" where pretty much everything is. Hang out spot, student store, cafeteria, art gallery, just everything. I don't often go to the student center because I don't actually hang out at my college, I usually just go to class and then go home. One day I was really hungry, and was in the mood for chicken tenders so I stopped by the student center in between classes to get some. I got my food, a drink, and sat down by myself. 

After a few minutes this guy sat at my table and told me him and his friend have an online show called ""chicks on campus"" which is just about interviewing girls at our college, he wanted to know if I was interested. Journalism is a big major at my college and a lot of people make videos at the college so I actually believed this was for a class project, so I said yes because I was happy to help people out with their school stuff. He told me he'd be back with his friend and then left. When he walked away I just imagined in my head that he'd be asking what my major was, and what I want to do in my life but I was completely wrong. 

He comes back with his friend who introduced himself as ""Beets"" to me, and told me to ""act natural"". Beets pulls out his cell phone and starts to record our conversation. I thought it was really weird that he was using a cell phone but I just figured they forgot their camera for something. The guy that I met first started asking me simple questions like my name, age, and what I like to do in my free time. He then started asking me strange questions about my relationship, they started off as kind of innocent asking things like ""how long have you two been together?"" ""what was your first date like?"" but then he just dropped a creeper bomb. ""What is your favorite sex postion?"" ""how many people have you slept with?"" ""what is your breast size?"". Once he started asking these questions my face got really red and I kept on saying ""i'm not comfortable answering these questions.""

He continued to ask these questions even though I kept on telling him I'm not answering them, and I started to get really mad. I told him that what he was asking me was really offensive and considered sexual harassment, I told him I felt objectified. He started laughing and said ""I'm just trying to see if you're a slut or not."" His friend ""beets"" then interrupted and said ""okay, let's wrap it up. Give him a big kiss!"" I gave him a glare and said ""No, I think we're done here. I'm uncomfortable.""

As they got up and left one of them said to the other ""She's a lot more uptight than the others"" and I just felt sick. I went to class after that and all I could think about is how they have that conversation on video and might be putting it on youtube. After class my friends talked me into going to security, so I did and pretty much got lectured by the security woman for not coming earlier. I was able to find them on the security camera but it was pretty blurry, I don't think they were ever caught. 

I guess this is what I get for going to community college though."	t5_2t3t8	True
1364992392.0	1bl0dp	Backpacking scare	here2brew	172	27	17	"Two years ago my wife and I decided we would  sleep in a shelter on the AT after a long 14 mile hike.  We were having dinner with another couple who was camping down the trail a bit around sundown when a man came in to the shelter.  He turned us down in joining us for dinner and had his sitting on the edge of the shelter watching us. Nightfall came and it was time for bed.  My wife and I were the only other people in the shelter that night and tried to make small talk before going to bed.  The man finally communicated with us a little as he set up the last of his gear and crawled into his bed turning off his light.  

Around 11 30 the man opens his pack and proceeds to pull out some device and open and close it for thirty minutes.  The problem is the noise was the distinct noise of a pocket knife.  Around 12 the man goes out with out a head lamp to ""use the bathroom"".  At this point I try to place my wifes hand on the knife beside my pillow because I know she will be awake and terrified as well.  The man comes back in the shelter and just stands by his sleeping bag for the next twenty minutes while we lay perfectly still, my back facing him.   Then out of nowhere I hear him begin to walk towards us. 

 I panicked and let go of my wifes hand I had been holding and turned over towards him pretending to be startled.  I honestly thought I was about to have to fight for my wifes life, not even mentioning my own.  The man scurried back to his bag fifteen feet away and zipped it up.  I am still not sure of his intent to this day and it bothers me the most.  I stayed awake for the rest of the night and would occasionally make noises to make him realize I was awake.

  At four thirty a horse, common in this section of the Grayson Highlands tried to get in the shelter with us and my wife feigned interest in him to make an excuse to get up.  I have never had a longer hike than the seven mile hike out the next day.   "	t5_2t3t8	True
1361716852.0	194t2p	The trailer	mjoallie	167	27	27	" When I was around 4 years old my mother separated from my father. My mom was broke, so she moved my brother's and me into a trailer park with her. The trailer only had 2 bedrooms, so my brother's and I shared a room. They both were on the bunk bed and my tiny bed was right by the window. At first, things seemed fine; nothing out of the ordinary. It was just a trailer park. Often times I would lie awake in bed staring out the window. I remember seeing a shadow of a man walking along our trailer. The first time I saw him I wrote him off as a neighbor. Until, he circled our trailer multiple times. He did this for what seemed like hours. He would sometimes run his fingers along my window and scratch the trailer as he did his rounds. He even made eye contact with me, and just stared at me through the glass for long periods of time. Being the scared 4 year old I was, I didn't move. I was frozen in fear. He did this almost nightly. Almost like a routine. My mom eventually heard him making noise on our trailer, and she made us sleep in her room. After about a week of sleeping in my mom’s room, he got violent. He began to bring something like a chain, and he would run it along our trailer. He started banging on our windows and trying to open the door to our trailer. My mom eventually started calling the cops on him. Each time she called though, he was always gone before they got there. Things continued in this pattern for days. 
Eventually, my mom slowly started to get back together with my dad.  She wasn’t fully back together with him, so we remained in the trailer. Now, over this period of time we started seeing my dad more. However, since my dad is a long haul truck driver, we didn’t see him all the time. My mom began to let my dad even stay with us when he wasn’t on the road. Each time my dad would come home, the man never came. We loved it when my dad was home. We could sleep in our own beds and things seemed normal. However, when he left, the man started bothering us again. He could tell when my dad was home because his big rig was parked near our trailer.
My dad eventually got tired of us being tormented at night, so he took matters into his own hands. Since the man knew when my dad was home and wouldn’t do anything when he was, my dad parked his big rig miles away. My mom snuck my dad inside quietly that night, without the man knowing. As usual, after we all went to bed, the man came. Except, on this night it was particularly bad. That night, we had a huge rain storm, and the man was outside with his chain hitting our trailer. He did this for about an hour until my dad snuck outside and laid down in a bush until the man came around. My dad jumped on him and began to beat on him until he got away. My dad chased him miles down the road, until it was no longer possible to get to him, because he ditched out into farm land. We never heard from the man again. He never came back and shortly after we moved away.

1358292274.0	16nd7h	"""My Daughter Is Sick"""	Azrius	180	38	11	"Greetings, assorted storytellers, lurkers, and ghouls! 

My tale isn't quite so disturbing as some of the others you've read here. There is no murder, no prolonged harassment; I don't believe my life was in any real danger, looking back. Even so; I'd like to share the story of the time I was robbed at knife-point.  Fair warning: this might get a bit long. I'm a touch wordy. 

First, some background information. It was towards the end of October, and I was on my way back from an anniversary dinner with my girlfriend of two years. I was a touch dressed up, as a result, with a suit just visible under my longcoat. I was also listening to music, and more or less shutting out the rest of the world.

I'm also not a big guy, nor am I all that physically imposing. I'm probably about 5'8 or 5'10, and between 160 and 180 pounds. This fellow probably had at least eighty to a hundred pounds on me, and was at least an inch or two taller.

All this in mind; I suppose I looked like the perfect victim. 

The time was around midnight, and I'd just entered an LRT station. It was a relatively safe area of the city, and I'd lived here for six years without incident, so I wasn't particularly concerned. Not only that, the whole area was peppered with security cameras. I felt secure.

Entering the station; I noticed that there were two people sitting on a nearby windowsill - a tall, thin man who looked to be in his fifties, and a rather massive fellow who I assumed was at least twenty or so. I didn't really pay them any mind until the second of the two approached me, intercepting me before I could reach an escalator down to the train platform. 


""Hey man, do you have any money?"" 

I figured he was just some ordinary panhandler. At this point, there was nothing about his demeanor to suggest otherwise - though I did find it curious how closely his companion was watching the two of us. 

""No, sorry. I don't carry cash on me."" A lie, of course- though I only had a paltry $5.00 in my wallet. I began to turn and walk away, and he edged a bit closer to me as I did. He was already becoming slightly aggravated. 

""Just spare some cash, man, my daughter's sick, man, I need the money."" 

""I told you, I don't have any cash on me."" With that, I continued walking. Just as I was about to reach the escalator, I felt a powerful hand on my shoulder. He spun me around, positioning me so I was approximately five feet from his face.

As he did so, I heard a 'click;' saw a flash of yellow in his hand. It took me a moment to realize what was happening, but after a few seconds, my brain registered a single thought: 

""That's a knife."" 

I froze up. A rapid sequence of somewhat panicked thoughts went through my head. This sort of shit didn't happen in this area of the city! This was the kind of incident you'd hear about downtown, or to the southeast, in back alleys and seedy bus stops. Not here. It was safe here. There wasn't crime here. I should do something. I shouldn't give him money. I should-

""Man, my daughter's sick, I need money, just give me some cash, man."" 

I pulled out my wallet. Yanked out the five dollar bill, and placed it in his open palm. 

""Thanks man, you really helped me, man."" 

He put the knife away, and walked back to where he was sitting before. 

I was pissed. I was also determined to make sure this asshole didn't rob anyone else. I immediately called the transit help line from a small panel on the platform, and informed them of what happened. I watched him attempt the same thing with another fellow, who didn't realize the guy had a knife and kept walking. He backed off and returned to his spot. I informed the near-victim what happened, and he stuck around.


Eventually, the police arrived, the tall man bolted, and the other one tried to run. They were faster. 

Immediately, he started bawling his eyes out, screaming at the top of his lungs. ""I didn't do anything!"" he howled ""He set me up! I don't have a knife!"" 

At that point, I calmly pointed the police to the location on his belt where he'd placed the knife before. 

Anyway, I stuck around for somewhere between another half hour to an hour to give a full police report, then called my roommate to come pick me up, at which point I went to Mcdonalds. One of the officers stayed with me the whole time. 

Here's the kicker (which I found out from the police shortly after the mugger's arrest): the kid didn't have a daughter. He was thirteen years old, and carrying at least a grand in what I assume was stolen cash. Off to a fine start in life, wasn't he? Sadly, they didn't catch the guy who was with him; the fellow who probably put him up to it.

Anyway, I'm very careful about taking the train at night now, and I rarely go near any stations unless I've someone travelling with me. I'm toying with the idea of some self defense courses, as well - though the officers told me I did everything right. Sure doesn't feel like it, most days. 

On the plus side, I got my five dollars back. 

TL;DR: Some thug robs me at knifepoint an LRT station; I call the police and stick around long enough to watch them take the guy down, at which point he starts bawling like a child. Makes sense, though: he was only thirteen. "	t5_2t3t8	True

One day my older sister and I were home because of a day off of school, while our mom had to go into work. This left us home alone, which wasn't really unusual.

Now some context as to the layout of our house at the time. It was positioned on a hill, so one side of our rec room had a sliding glass door to the back yard while the other side of the room had a high window that was right at ground level. It was also a split level house, so our front door was at the landing of the stairs.

 We were downstairs watching tv when out of the corner of my eye, I saw someone pass the sliding glass doors through the vertical blinds. I told my sister, but in an effort not to panic, she said, ""nope, nope, you didn't see anything."" Just then we saw the door move as if someone was trying to pull it open. We both ducked down and crept to the stairs.

We were on our hands and knees because our front door had windows. My sister finally bolted up the second half of the stairs and into the kitchen. This left me right under to door as the person tried to open it. My sister peaked around the corner of the kitchen doorway to see if the person was still there.

When the coast was clear, I sprinted up the stairs and joined my sister in the kitchen, huddling from the windows. I turn to find my sister with a huge kitchen knife, ready to attack the potential intruder. I stifled my laughter at the hilarious visual long enough to call my friend's dad who worked from home next door. While we waited, we could hear the person trying to open doors all around the house. Thank goodness my sister is paranoid and locks every door at all times.

Our neighbor showed up, baseball bat in hand, but said he had seen a white van drive away. I called my mom and she began to contact any company that came to our house (terminex, gardeners, etc.). Turns out it was a guy from terminex who was soon fired for this incident. There was no reason for him to try to come into the house especially without trying to ring the doorbell first.

1352226908.0	12qqc1	A Turkish Tattoo Parlor + 5 Female High School Tourists	mwmw1616	184	41	38	"The summer after my Junior year of high school I went on a trip with other students and a few teachers to Italy. It was pretty cool, we had a great time, and our teacher gave us a lot of freedom which was neat for us, but looking back probably not smart. 

We were on a cruise of the Grecian islands and docked at some point in Turkey (I can't remember now). It was myself and a few friends, including one girl who was younger than the rising juniors and seniors on the trip- Susie. Well, my dad told me not to get off the boat in Turkey, but I chose to ignore him because I didn't want to be the only one left. Not saying this was a bad choice, or that Turkey is bad, but he was overprotective..so I was already on my guard..assuming that this place might be kind of dangerous if my dad is concerned.

We walked through the stores and got catcalled, yelled at, bartered with, etc. That's when Susie said she really wanted to get a henna tattoo (for some reason) so we ventured away from the port and into the city looking for a tattoo place. We found one, kind of a hole in the wall not in the main part of town. Looking back, I see that as very stupid. 

Anyway, we go in and a few of the girls and Susie talk with the artists to get their Hennas. I can tell that the men (and one woman) in the parlor think that we are silly tourists, and I just watch them interact as I am kind of nervous. They all go to their respective artists, and that's when I randomly pick up on the conversation between Susie and her artist. He is telling her about how beautiful she is, and how her skin is perfect. She's young, naive, and had just been dumped by her boyfriend so was eating it up. I am unsure at this point if I should say something..not wanting to be rude, and I seem to be the only one who is concerned. That's when he seemingly starts to size her up..looking her over, going over her attributes verbally with her, and one of the other men starts paying attention too. At this point, I am super uncomfortable with everyone staring at her, and then us, so I make up my mind to get us out of there ASAP. Most of the girls are done, but he hasn't finished hers as he is talking. I tell her we need to go meet our group, and we need to leave asap. She complains that she doesn't want to and he completely ignores me and continues to ask her if she is a virgin. Instead of seeing that as a not ok thing for a middle aged man to ask of a 15 year old girl in general, she giggles and shakes her head no. The man makes eye contact with another guy in the group..and I say ""that's it, we're leaving!"" We had already paid so there wasn't an issue. They tried to protest but I grabbed her arm and pulled her out, calling my friends and not stopping walking until we had found our chaperones and sat down.

She was mad at me for the rest of the trip, and made fun of me for being a ""prude"" and ""paranoid."" I was embarrassed after I calmed down because I was a teenager girl and wanted to be liked..but now after watching the taken movies I am 100% happy that's how I reacted.

Edit: I mention the taken movies just to say I now realize how easy it is for girls to be snatched abroad..whether it be Albania, Paris, or Turkey. And yes, in the second movie it was still the Albanians taking people. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1340008794.0	v7tue	Unwelcome Guests	wedontlivehere	158	18	15	"I lived with my friend and her mother on the outskirts of a small town in Louisiana called Eunice. I was mainly helping my friend out with her mother, who was failing her battle with brain cancer and wanted to spend the rest of her days at home. 

Home wasn't much, just a small, two-bedroom trailer. I took my friend's old bed, and my friend stayed in the largest bedroom closest to the living room, which used to be her mother's. Her mother slept on the couch, where the EMTs could get to her easier if needed. It was bleak to say the least. 

I would often stay up with her mother during the night and watch the Game Show Network. That night, I was doing just that. We were guessing the answers to the questions when I heard glass shatter from my friend's room. 

I knew my friend had gone out on a date, but she had told her mother that she was going to bed early and climbed out of the window. Something about not worrying her. I let out a chuckle, knowing she probably broke it trying to get back in. 

I told her mom that she probably left the window open, and the wind knocked it down and broke it. I got up from the couch and walked into the room.

I come face to face with this guy &gt;

We lock eyes, and then he looks down at my hand. He says, 'Oh, shit!' and dives -literally dives- out the window, head first. The sound of screeching tires and shouting lets me know he's gone. 

In shock, I set to work sweeping up the glass on the floor. I go back into the living room, tell her mother that it was nothing, and we go back to watching tv. 

I assume he thought that the remote in my hand was a gun. Thank god for that, because from what I'd seen on the news about him over the years, I would have probably been killed.  "	t5_2t3t8	True

One night , while over Tom's apartment with a few friends , we're watching a movie. Tom offers everyone a drink. He told me that he had a ""special one"" for me. I assumed he meant that he just put more alcohol in mine. Cool. Apparently there was more than just that in it though. I remember after having a few sips feeling odd. I excused myself to use the bathroom. I felt lightheaded and disoriented. I had only had one drink before those few sips so I definitely wasn't drunk. After splashing my face with water , I decided to ask one of my friends for a ride home. 

When I walked out of the bathroom , Tom was waiting for me. He pulled me into his bedroom and started undressing me. The rest is a bit fuzzy but I remember him feeling me up and telling me it ""was finally going to happen."" I told him ""no"" but was too out of it to really fight back. I guess one of our friends noticed us gone and came to look for us. He came in and ended up stopping Tom. Our friends know I'm not into him at all. I guess they threatened to call the cops on Tom but he insisted that I ""came on to him."" Luckily , my friends were there to save me. They took me home. 

Tom later apologized and confessed to slipping something in my drink. None of us really see him anymore. We stopped going around after this incident. He blames me for losing quite a few friends. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1371161785.0	1gargk	I'm Being Stalked. What do I do? (x-post from /r/rbi)	imbeingstalkedhelp	174	31	43	"I'm an immigrant to the U.S. and I met my future-husband in 2006 and we got hitched in 2010. After we got married, I received a conditional green card (must stay married for 5 years or revoked). Fast forward to early 2012, things were not going so well between us so we mutually agreed to separate (not divorce) for the time being. We both needed time to decide what the future of ""us"" would be. My husband used his separation time to get a girlfriend, so in turn, I got a boyfriend.

I joined a dating site in early 2013, met Al, hooked up a few times, and then due to my unresolved past, he decided to end things with me. Fast forward to April. Al randomly texts me professing his love and desire to be with me forever. At this point, I had already moved on from my fling and was not interested in his advances. One morning, when I walked outside of my apartment, I noticed my car tires were slashed, and my license plate stolen. Ironically enough, I get a call the very same morning from Al inquiring how I'm doing, etc. I explain I'm not doing so well due to the car, and he offers his help with my car. Being a damsel in distress, I accept his offer to help me with my car trouble, filing a police report, etc. Because I was very stressed, he offered to take me to lunch, and later offers to come back to my place and cuddle until I calm down. So we end up hooking up again.

After our casual hook up, Al kept texting me non-stop, professing his love for me, and ignoring my requests to be left alone (I didn't want a relationship). One day, I received a 5 page letter addressed to the U.S. Immigration Department, in detail, outlining numerous false accusations stating my initial marriage was bullshit (fraud/federal crime). Although false, these accusations could lead to me being deported and my husband being sent to federal prison. The conditions he offered for not sending the letter would be for me to date him and have a family with him. Although I could prove these allegations are false, it would cost a lot of money, time, etc. and I don't really want to make more trouble for myself (i.e. my husband and I are separated. I don't want the govt. looking into it anyways). Al also told me that if he couldn't have me, no one in this country (U.S.) could have me.

As days went by and I didn't respond to his threats, he started to verbally threaten me, saying it didn't matter if I moved away to a different county, state, or country, he would always follow me until I agreed to his conditions. He would randomly come to my apartment and sit on the doorstep awaiting my arrival. He would post things on my social media accounts, tag me in creepy pictures, message me with threats, the most threatening one being he would follow me until one of ""us"" dies. Around this point, I began to realize that my car tires were probably were not just some random act of vandalism. This also made me realize that if Al was capable of vandalizing my car, he was capable/serious of causing me a great amount of trouble with the immigration department. Everyday, I grew more paranoid because throughout the day I would receive non-stop text messages from him accusing me of lying to him (in general) and telling me he knew where I was at that exact time. More paranoia sets in and even when driving on the interstate, I couldn't stop looking around me out of fear he was following me. Taking my friend's advice, I ended up going to the police and getting the documentation needed for a restraining order. I filled it out and turned it in.

The next day, I was surprised to find the police at my door telling me to grab my stuff and I was being admitted to a mental institution (in handcuffs) because Al went to the police and told them I was stalking them, and I was probably going to go the police station and file a complaint against him. In turn, Al got a restraining order against me, telling the police everything he did to me I did to him. Another surprise was that the person who handed me the restraining order papers handed me the wrong papers and the restraining order was never filed. On top of all this, Al told the police I was unstable and was threatening to commit suicide. As it is in many states, accusations like this are not taken lightly and when the police came and got me from my apartment, I was taken to the mental institution (in handcuffs) for a 72 hour psych-evaluation.

When I got out today, I was contacted by my supervisor at work informing me that a resignation letter in my name had been turned in saying that I'm resigning from my current position because of my mental illness. Even more, Al informed me I should expect for my colleagues to receive photoshopped pictures of my naked self. Despite my ""stalking of Al,"" he has continued to message me on my social media accounts telling me to put everything he has done in the past and begs me to start a family with him. I've had to re-do my restraining order paperwork, so the police report is pending and I'm gathering evidence for my meeting with the lawyer tomorrow."	t5_2t3t8	True
1369061256.0	1ep2dw	Just One Kiss (long)	love_occurs	170	32	17	"I've been lurking around here for a while now, so I thought I would share my creepiest story to pay you guys back for the hours of entertainment (read: I am procrastinating my revision).  This story takes place about 3 years ago, when I was still in undergrad and living in a fairly nice townhouse community with my friends/roommates Rachel and Anna.     

A little bit of background information: in this particular townhouse community, there is one back porch for every two townhouses, meaning we shared a porch with another house.  Also, my roommates and I were considered ""party girls"" by our back porch neighbors, 3 somewhat socially awkward guys who rarely went out or threw parties of their own.  This night our neighbors had two friends visiting, and they asked us if we would throw a small party so their friends would have a good time.  Additionally, my school was a decent party school and had a fairly high ratio of girls to guys, so many guys (visitors or students) had a very entitled attitude and believed they could get any girl to go home with them.    

It started out normal enough.  Typical crowd of people, typical music, typical beer.  Rachel and I were sitting on the railing of the back porch, sipping our drinks and chatting with our close friend Ben and the two visitors, ""Black Shirt Guy"" and ""White Shirt Guy"" (Rachel and I forgot their names about 10 minutes after we were introduced, so we've been calling them this for years).  We were all laughing, having a good time, when suddenly White Shirt Guy picks me up, throws me over his shoulder and carries me inside.  At first I thought it was a joke, so I played along.  I laughed and playfully asked him to put me down as he carried me through the kitchen and into the living room, where several of our other friends were playing cards.    

When he reached the staircase leading up to my bedroom, though, I realized he was not joking and I began to panic.  I yelled at him to put me down RIGHT NOW and started trying to hit his back, but he calmly carried me up the stairs and into my room, where he then threw me on my bed.  I laid there, stunned, for a few seconds while he just stared at me.  Not once during this encounter had he said a single word.  Luckily, Ben and Rachel came charging into my room, and Rachel pulled me away while Ben yelled at White Shirt Guy.    

The creepy didn't end there, though.  Throughout the night White Shirt Guy kept pulling me away from my friends and trying to hold me, stroke my hair, and get me to kiss him.  He apologized for the ""misunderstanding,"" but remained very insistent that I should let him hold me/kiss me.

""You're so pretty.  I just want to kiss you!""    
""Just come sit on my lap.  I just want to give you a kiss.""    
""Why won't you kiss me?!  Just one kiss!  I want to kiss you!"" et cetera.    


Each time I declined and pushed my way back to my friends, only to have him try again 10 minutes later.  Eventually he left me alone, just to go sit on the staircase and stare at me through the banister, knowing that I couldn't get up to my room without physically climbing over him.  I am 100% sure this was deliberate; he did not want me to go to bed without him noticing.    

At one point he left to go to the bathroom and I seized the opportunity to bolt up to my room and, thank god, had the presence of mind to lock the door behind me.  30 seconds later White Shirt Guy realized what had happened and ran up the stairs to my room.  He tried to open the door and, finding it locked, got very angry and started pounding on the door, yelling my name, swearing at me, and demanding I let him in.  I freaked and locked myself in my bathroom (we each had our own private bathrooms as well as the half bath in the kitchen), hoping I would be safe behind two sets of locked doors.  I'm not sure how long I was huddled in the bathroom, but eventually he did get bored and he wandered away, back to the neighbor's house.  I eventually crawled into my bed and turned the TV on full volume, so I wouldn't hear him if he came back.    

I didn't interact with White Shirt or Black Shirt Guy for the rest of their stay, and whenever they came back to visit my roommates and I conveniently found other places to be.    

TL;DR: college neighbors ask us to throw a party for their visiting friends, one friend carries me to my bedroom against my will, tries to get me to cuddle with/kiss him, blocks me from getting into my room, spends long time pounding on my door and yelling at me.  Black Shirt Guy ended up being quite creepy as well, but this story is long enough already...

1364400644.0	1b47b7	"The ""Cable Man"""	Draulable	166	25	14	"This happened a few days after my girlfriend and I had finished moving into our new apartment. We both wanted to make brownies one night for dessert but the oven wasn’t working. We called the maintenance the next morning and they told us that they would be coming to fix the problem sometime during the week but they didn’t have an exact time or date for us. It wasn’t a problem since my girlfriend works retail and stays home until the afternoon anyway. My job is a 9 to 5 so I wouldn’t have been home in time for the repair man to come.

One morning, I am warming up my car and waiting for the traffic report to come on the radio when the news had come on. The news report was about a recent string of burglaries being committed in my area by people claiming to be utility, cable, or maintenance people coming to do work. Several residents had already been robbed, beaten, and in some cases, sexually assaulted or raped at gun point. They finished the report by urging residents to ask for identification and check with the companies to see if they are really employees for the company and to check for company vehicles. 

Needless to say, a chill went down my spine the moment the report had ended. I immediately pulled out my phone and text my girlfriend the report I had heard and told her to make sure that the person who came was really from the maintenance department from the development we had moved into. I made her promise to call me and stay on the phone the moment that someone had arrived so I could make sure she was safe.

A few days later, while I am at work, I receive a phone call from my girlfriend. There was a man at the door claiming to be from the cable company and that he had to reinstall the cable because they had given us the wrong equipment. My girlfriend asked the man for ID but all he showed was a driver's license. He couldn’t produce anything showing he was from our cable provider and there wasn’t a company truck parked anywhere outside. I immediately grabbed my landline at work and called the police. After a few seconds of banter, the man walked away from the door and never came back. 

The police arrived a few minutes after the man had left and took my girlfriend’s statement and description of the man. Hopefully, they’ll catch him before he strikes again.

1357599667.0	165b6v	Sometimes you can't even trust cops.	YesImLoggedIn	176	33	34	"This happened to me about two years ago, when I was on a cross-country road trip with my good friend Kim. We started in the Northwest and our final destination was in Georgia. We were trying to make this trip as quickly as possible, and since it was just the two of us, we took shifts sleeping and driving. 

We had just passed through Laramie, Wyoming, where I got pulled over for speeding. (Not much, only 10 miles over the speed limit.) I apologized to the police officer, and he kindly let us off the hook, since our car had no cruise control and we had a long way to go ahead. After leaving Laramie, we didn't stop for a long time, and the highway rarely cut through any towns. 

It was probably three or four in the morning, and the highway was deserted. Tall pines lined the two-lane blacktop, and jagged mountains framed the starlit sky above. Kim was sleeping heavily, her chair reclined all the way down, a blanket thrown over her head. I had the radio on, but she was so exhausted she did not stir. 

I was trying to concentrate on the road and the quiet music on the radio to stay awake. Visibility was very limited--there were no lights on this road. Suddenly, red and blue lights flashed in my review mirror. I hastily looked at my speedometer, but I was diligently following the speed limit after the narrow escape from getting a ticket earlier. (As a broke college student, ain't nobody got time for that.)

I pulled over, killed my engine, and rolled down my window. The cop car behind me appeared to be an unmarked vehicle, but it was hard to tell. Kim didn't stir as the police officer approached my window. 

""Ma'am,"" he said in a Mid-Western drawl, ""Do you know why I pulled you over today?""

""No, officer, I don't."" His flashlight was pointed directly at my face, and I had to avert my eyes. I looked at the badge on his chest instead of his face.

""Your plates sure are from far away. Where are you headed?"" The police officer in Laramie had asked the same thing.

""Georgia. Family emergency.""

""Is that so? Well, miss, you aren't in any shape to make it to Georgia from Nebraska. No sirree.""

I frowned. Was my car breaking down? Tail lights out? In my tired haze had I missed something vital? ""I'm sorry, what's wrong?""

""Here, miss, step out of the car, I can show you."" He gestured with his flashlight, and the beam slanted across Kim's blanket-shrouded face, and she sat up.

She yawned. ""What's going on?""

The police officer abruptly turned, walked away, and got into his car. He flipped a U-turn and sped off in the opposite direction down the highway. 

Kim and I stared at each other for a moment, before I started the car, rolled up the window, and sped off, with no regard for the speed limit this time.

I live on a long rural road in the quiet parts of Auckland, New Zealand. When I say long I mean over 5km. Anyway, I'll keep this short and sweet. I was coming home from school as the sun was beginning to set and ahead on the side of the road I saw a baby carseat. It was positioned near some trees, a blanket draped over the top. I could see the bulge of an infant underneath and despite me being a maternal human being I just kept driving. 
Something felt off, really off. Why would a baby's carseat be on the side of a rural road? 
Fast forward a few days and I had forgotten about it, only to be watching the news and was horrified and chilled to my core of what I was about to learn. 
In my area there had been a woman attacked when she got out of her car to inspect a baby's carseat on the side of the road. By the time she lifted the blanket to check the infant she was grabbed by two men watching and waiting nearby.

1348247691.0	1098l9	"""You have the most beautiful smile."""	nevillewearsprada	171	33	18	"This one isn't nearly as creepy as some of the other stories on here, but I've loved this subreddit since I discovered it a few months ago so I thought I'd share this strange story.  Sorry it's a bit long, and perhaps without much payoff, but I hope you enjoy it anyway. 

I was 16 when I got my first job as a hostess at a major restaurant chain.  Once I got the hang of everything, I absolutely loved it.  I made good friends with everyone I was working with, management liked me and treated everyone well, and I felt like I was getting pretty good at my job.  So, I became quite comfortable and maybe let my guard down a bit too much.

If you've ever seen the movie ""Waiting..."", you know that preying on underage hostesses is a pastime of many servers and guests alike.  I dealt with my share of creepers and definitely told people off when I had to, but for the most part just got flattered at the attention (hey...I was sixteen.)

One night I was doing my thing, getting the door for people and giving them my best ""welcome!"" smile, when I noticed a couple guys walk in, maybe in their mid-twenties.  One of them kept eye contact a little longer, but I didn't think twice about it.  They went to pick up their carry-out and I kept greeting people.  

Once the hostess area was cleared I saw the guy come back up to the hostess stand.  He was cute and looked bashful when he said, ""I don't normally do anything like this, but you have the most beautiful smile, and I just had to tell you.  Do you think I could have your phone number and maybe we could hang out sometime?""

I was a vain, naive girl who drank up male attention like vodka cranberries, so I was simply flattered and not at all creeped out.  All the same, I knew he was old enough for things to be illegal between us, and then some.  So I smiled coyly and said, ""I don't know...I'm seventeen (even though I was 16.)""

He said, just as coyly, ""Oh...I'm 26.""  A Pause. ""I can keep a secret if you can.""

Stupid me sees nothing wrong with giving this man my phone number, and the risk of it even excites me a bit.  How cool am I?   Some cute older guy wants to go out with me!

He texted me that night.  His name was Luis and offered to take me out that weekend.  I agreed and that Saturday we went out to dinner at a really nice restaurant and actually had a pretty nice time.  At one point he started saying some sexual stuff, and asked me at one point if I was a virgin (I was, and he seemed pleased), stuff I didn't really feel that comfortable talking to anyone about, let alone on a first date, but I just chalked it up to the age gap.

The next morning he called me asking if I wanted to get breakfast with him.  More free food, alright!  After breakfast, he offers to show me his place.  Now, I wasn't so stupid to be oblivious to the fact that he was probably going to try to have sex with me, but I was stupid enough to accept his invitation, thinking in my little pea brain that I'd be in control and able to stop him if things went awry.  I was still wooed by the whole ""older man with a job, car, and house wants to take me out and stuff"" charm.

Strangely nothing scary happened at his place.  He kissed me and laid be down on his bed but I got up and walked into the kitchen and he didn't stop me.  Then, he showed me his SWEET ASS WHIP.  In addition to the civic he drove me around in before, he also had a 1984 corvette in really good condition.  And.  He let me DRIVE it.  A 16-year-old girl.  It was awesome but I still thought it strange.

A few nights after our dates he called me in the late evening to chat.  As we were talking, he again took a turn toward strange sexual topics, saying that he loved when girls wear white panties and asking me if I would wear white panties and dress up like a school girl for him.  He said we could go to the beach together and rent a condo and spend the week together just the two of us, he'd pay for everything and we could stay in bed all day.  I told him I was going to spend the summer (which was soon) with my mother three states away, and he asked if he could come visit me, saying he'd love to meet my mother.  I tried to be as polite as possible, trying to act mature for my age and not uncool or anything, but I was super freaked out.  

I stopped calling and texting him after that night, until one day a few weeks later I got a text from him while I was in my last class of the day.  He said he was waiting for me in the school parking lot if I needed a ride, and that we could go driving in his vette again if I wanted.  I didn't respond and cautiously sneaked onto the bus, even thinking I may have spotted him in the lot by the buses.  

After my summer away, I resumed work at the restaurant, and continued to work there for five years.  I was always frightened I might see him again (it was a small town and like I said, we're a major restaurant, so I figured he was bound to come back), but years went by without me hearing anything.  At 19, I had moved up to carry-out and serving, and had gotten really close with a girl who was also a carry-out person and had been working there even longer than I had.  One night it was just the two of us in our take-away corner.  The phone rang, I answered it (we have to say our names when we answer the phone) and asked for a name for the order: Luis.  I asked for his car make and color: an old blue vette.  My heart dropped into my stomach.  I took his whole order without saying anything.  He called back, I answered again.

""Hi, is this nevillewearsprada?  Like, THE nevillewearsprada?""

""Well, I'm the only nevillewearsprada that works here, so I guess, yeah...""

His voice lit up.  He asked if I remembered him, made sure it would be me who brought out his food, and told me I'd be getting a great tip from him.  Ugh.

When he got there, he came in to get his food and asked me for my phone number and said how good it was to see me and everything, but I barely gave him the time of day and just gave him his food and said bye.

As soon as he left, my friend said, ""Dude, you know that guy?""

I told her the whole story.  Her jaw dropped.  She said, ""When I first started working here (at least three years before me), he said the exact same thing to me, that I had the most beautiful smile he'd ever seen.  I was stupid enough to give him my number and he called me nonstop for weeks.""

I responded, ""Wow, what business does a 26-year-old have preying on teenage girls like that?""

Her eyebrows raised.  ""He told you he was 26?  Girl, he lied to you.  That man is pushing 40 for sure.""

TL;DR: The incredibly idiotic 16-year-old me unwittingly entertained the creepy sexual fantasies of a predatory middle-aged man."	t5_2t3t8	True
1334775192.0	sgfvb	My grandparent's encounter. 	missbays	160	23	15	"My grandmother has told me this story a million times and it always freaks me out. My grandparents lived about 3 minutes from town but their house was basically the middle of nowhere on a long stretch of road. There were no houses on the other side of their road, just woods. They were surrounded by farms and the like. 

My grandfather owned his own hardwood floor company so he had a workshop near the house filled with machines and tools and on their carport, right outside the front door, they had more tools and a huge freezer where they kept mostly meat. They were very familiar with their sparse neighbors and most of them were family. They never even bothered to lock the door. 

One late night when my father and uncle were still fairly young, my grandparents woke up after hearing commotion on the carport. My grandfather went to investigate and he saw a man rummaging through his tools and there was meat all over the ground. The man was holding a huge monkey wrench. My grandfather was a very calm and reasonable man so he politely asked the man what he wanted. The man told him he wanted food so my grandfather told him to take whatever he wanted and please leave, as his young children and wife were in the house. My grandmother was watching the whole thing from the window and thought the man was acting very strange and was just all over the place. 

After several minutes of coaxing, the man finally left without taking anything. My grandparents were very shaken up. They cleaned up the mess and went inside. That's when they realized the man had cut their phone line and had left some tools inside. 

My grandmother is convinced that the man planned on killing them and truthfully he had every chance in the world to do so. After that, she didn't let her kids play outside for weeks and they invested in several locks. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1370969908.0	1g4qvq	Crackhead break in.	Nicnak1118	164	25	19	"About 10 years ago I was 18/19 years old and had just moved out of my mom's for the first time.  I had a job as a barista so I wasn't making much money and had to settle on a shitty studio apartment. My sister use to joke with me that the building looked like an old insane asylum turned apartment complex. Needless to say I didn't have the most classy, high end neighbors. But rent was cheap and it was on the bus line and close enough to my mom's house so it worked for me. 

One night I was home watching T.V. It was about 1130 p.m and I hear a knock on my door. This was odd because the apartments were all secured entry and if you didn't have a key you had to buzz in to the manager and they had to unlock the door. When I looked through the peep hole I saw an older black lady fidgeting. I grew up in the suburbs so I had 0 streets smarts and was very naive. I opened the door part way. She immediately starts rambling that she needs to borrow my phone to call a cab. She starts talking about how she needs to get over to her sisters house because someone was sick ect ect ect. All this time she is trying to look around me to see into my apartment. I got this overwhelming feeling that something wasn't right and told the lady I didn't have a phone set up in my apartment yet. I told her that there was a pay phone down the street a couple buildings over. When I tried to close the door she kinda pushed me back a bit to try to get her foot in the way so I couldn't close it. She started rambling again, she didn't have any change, she needed to use the restroom, her poor family/friend/pet needed her there as soon as possible. The whole time she is twitching and fidgeting around. I finally managed to push her out of the door frame and shut the door in her face. She knocked a couple more times and then ended up wandering off.

Now all that would have been creepy enough except about 10 min later I hear a thump at one of the windows. Like I said the apartment was cheap so they just had windows and no screens. I went over to look out and I see the same lady standing on the ground but now she's with a black dude, (just as rundown) and he had set up a ladder against the side of the building. I was on the second floor so the ladder easily reached my window. The black guy started climbing up the ladder towards me. I opened the window to ask what the fuck he thought he was doing and that's when I saw he had a hammer in one hand. With out thinking I grabbed the top of the ladder and pushed it back. ( you'd be surprised how hard it is to tip over a ladder with someone climbing it, nothing like the tom and jerry cartoons). He managed to jump off before it fell. They both stood at the bottom of my window yelling at me saying, ""You stupid bitch, we just want to use your phone."" That's when I picked up my phone and started to call the police. Once they saw that they both hightailed it out of there.

When the police came I filed a report but they were never caught. They never came back but it still creeps me out thinking about what could have happened to me if I had let that lady in."	t5_2t3t8	True
1366442025.0	1cqb6y	Short and Sweet: Followed Home and Weird Packages on My Doorstep	oliviabloom	151	11	17	"I will keep this one short and sweet:


I previously held a job a topless dancer at a gentleman's club.  The money was fantastic and was able to get me through tough times, as well as pay for my education.  One customer, Chris was very loyal to me, spent a lot of money on me, but had a drug/alcohol problem that would cause him to act out of character.  I was his favorite girl and he told me this often.  One evening after work my manager walked me to my car and waited until I was out of the parking lot.  I lived extremely close to work right off of a main road in an apartment complex.


I hadn't noticed anyone following me since I was on a main road and I was just trying to get home and get to sleep.  Chris had pulled in behind me and said hi, gave me a huge hug, and said ""Do you live here?""  In a moment of brilliance, I said no, I was just checking if a friend was home.  I rang the doorbell of my apartment, didn't get an answer (obviously) and told Chris I would see him later.


I sped out of the parking lot and immediately drove back to the club since it was much closer than the nearest police station.  I called my manager, told him I was being followed, and he met me in the parking lot.  I beat Chris there by maybe 30 seconds, and my manager escorted me inside the club and locked me inside.  My manager told him he was never to follow me anywhere and was no longer welcome in the club.  Upon hearing this news, Chris attempted to punch my manager in the face, screaming ""I HAVE TO SEE HER, I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT HER.  SHE LOVES ME.""  Needless to say, Chris was beaten to a pulp and no longer allowed in the club.


The creepiest part is I think Chris knew that apartment was mine, even though I started parking around the back of the complex so my car wouldn't be visible.   Even if he didn't know it was mine, he likely assumed my friend would pass along his gifts.   For the next two months I would wake up to packages with my name on it on the door step; no postage.

The first package:  A heart pillow that said ""I Love You"".
The second package:  A dozen white roses.
The third package:  A box full of rocks with a note that said ""I know you miss me.""
The fourth package:  A box of cut up red roses with four syringes inside of it.


I never received another package or heard of Chris again, but I did move when my lease was up.

1346247465.0	z0ouk	The People in the Woods.	airsoftbob	167	26	40	"I originally posted my story on r/nosleep, but everyone downvoted it for some strange reason (I can't see why, this is as real as it gets)

I am an overweight guy but I have been on a diet the last couple of months, along with a healthy exercise regime (gym &amp; jogging) to get the weight off. 
Anyway, here is what this post is all about.. I go jogging a couple of nights a week in-and-around the forest/woods about a mile away from my home (North Wales, UK) I was out jogging in 'The Woods' (it's genuine name) one night a few days back. I stay off of the track most people would walk along, and run my own set course, deep into the dense trees.

I have ran my course a fair few times without anything strange or anything out of the ordinary happening. On Wednesday 22 of August, I was out running just as it is going dark. On this particular night, the atmosphere in the woods felt strange. It felt lonely and cold as there was nobody around. I started jogging through my trail and all was well, the sun was setting, making it darker and darker. I decided to quicken the pace as it was getting a bit too dark for me. I just continued jogging with Biffy Clyro blaring through headphones.

 Then I had noticed the surroundings looked a bit unfamiliar to me, I must have taken a wrong turn somewhere- with my low visibility due to the darkness and when you are jogging you kind of go into a world of your own (if you jog or run, you will know what I mean). I stopped to look around and figure out my bearings, I had no clue which path I had taken, or where I was. I decided the best idea would be to turn back and try to get onto my path, or at least somewhere I recognised.. I took my earphones out whilst I was having a slight jog back to familiar ground, by this time it was pretty much pitch black under the canopy of the trees..

A slight panic started as I was jogging fast to try and get to somewhere I knew. As I continued to look around, I saw a moving light which was lighting the sides of the trees and the above canopy (the light was quite far away at this point, and I couldn't see what the light source was) I thought this was a bit strange, so I stood still and peered over the nettles/tree branches to get a clearer look.

 As the light was coming closer, I hear a faint chanting noise coming from the same direction, as it got closer (still couldn't see what it was) the voices got louder. Curiosity got the better of me and I stood around a little longer to see what this was (as I was quite well hidden in the bushes I felt safe enough to stay). 

As it got closer, I could eventually see what the light source was. It was a long stick (somewhere around 4ft long with a ball of fire on the end, a bit like an old fashioned torch type thing) with a hand, covered in black, sleeve covered in a loose fitting black fabric. As the figure emerged enough so I could see him/her, the were dressed in full black robes with long hoods. Then, as the first person passed through the trees, more, slowly came passing into sight. They were walking slowly, whilst chanting in another language I have never heard before (not Welsh). 

Only one of them had the torch in their hand, the person at the front. As they got closer, I then realised if I ran away from them, They would've seen me, And I didn't want to running further into the middle of nowhere as I was already lost. I just crouched down into the bush/nettles as they passed by me. By this point, I could see them close enough to see their details.

There were about 15 to 20 of them, all walking in sync, chanting the same words, (a few would chant something, then the others would chant different words, in a reply kind of thing) As They were walking past me, I felt a horrible feeling I have never felt before. My heart was beating faster, everything felt as if it went colder, freezing cold (maybe this was my nerves/anxiety as I don't believe in ghosts) .

As they continued to walk on past me, I saw an insignia on the back of their robes (I have drawn a quick image of what it looked like here &gt; http://imgur.com/Z6QY6 sorry for the absolutely shocking image, but you get the idea) This then started me thinking about the Knight's Templar's (which my Grandad told me stories about years ago, and how they escaped to Scotland and Wales when they were disbanded- more info on the Templar's here &gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-IQLCgOTpg please watch this video, it is very interesting)

 After they had passed me and were a distance away I felt safe enough, I ran, faster than I had ran before. I was absolutely shattered, but I ran more and more, Eventually after a while, I found where I was and I walked, cautiously, home.
 It took me about 3 hours altogether to do a jog what usually takes me around an hour and 15 mins.

 Some weird stuff happens in this world, and I believe I have witnessed something truly strange, scary and disturbing... I have since changed my path and I always go jogging in the day now. If anyone has witnessed anything like this, please let me know. Thanks."	t5_2t3t8	True
1341683976.0	w6p02	Keep your car doors locked.	Seanll55	171	35	61	"I'm new to the site, and I must say, I fell in love in seconds. I love this place so much. I found this subreddit and decided to share some of my creepy/weird experiences as a kid that happened to me as I grew up. 

I don't exactly know the rules, or what not, so If I am breaking anything, I apologize. 

It started when my Mom and I left the mall, it was really hot out and we were carrying a bunch of clothes and other random items to the Jeep, my mom used to own a cute little red Jeep that hummed like a bird and was a smooth as driving on butter. I loved it. 

As we began our 30 minute journey home, we stopped, got food, played the radio, laughed, anything a Mother and Son would do. My mom is so funny!

I wasn't raised G rated, my parents told me the truth about life and I am so happy they did. I have a friend who is seventeen and still has yet to see a Rated R movie. I guess that's how he was raised...

Anyways, we are close to home now, the roads are calmer, it's late, all my Mom and I want to do is go to bed after a long day of shopping. My dad and brothers were out camping for the weekend and I chose not to go, so my Mom surprised me with a shopping spree. 

The roads are dark, and vacant, and the music is off. I am laying my head on the window and my Mom is driving. Now here's where it get's freaky.

We pulled up to the train-tracks, having to slow down, not wanting to Dukes of Hazard it and fly 20 feet in the air. It was extremely dark, and the tracks were only lit by a dim orange light connected to a small brick control station for the tracks.   

My mom began to tap me, pointing into the darkness.

""Look, look honey, what is that?""
It seemed to be the figure of a man, but it was too dark. My mom stopped the Jeep and watched as it got closer. 

""Mom, go! This is creepy. I think it's a person."" I whispered.

""Yeah, I know, honey, but what if he's hurt?"" 

I was about to say something when the figure lunged at my door yanking the handle and pulling the door open, I fell over the seat belt catching me, and I began to pull the door back shut.

""DRIVE MOM, DRIVE!"" I cried as the tires squealed. He held on for a brief moment then fell and rolled off. I slammed the door closed, locking it quickly. We both looked back through the window of the Jeep watching the man stand up and start walking down the street we were driving.

We didn't go home that night. We kept driving until my Mom got a hold of my aunt on the phone, and convinced her to let us stay there. Then once we were over, they called the police and handled it together. 

My mom kept apologizing to me, almost every two minutes, she keep checking to see if I was okay, if I was too shaken, I don't know, I won
t understand her concern. To this day, which is two years later, I still think about that man, why he would open my door, and what he would do if he got in?

1350550698.0	11ojdg	My creepy roommate	resmiranda	186	51	27	"I had been having problems with my dorm roommate since the beginning of the semester. She didn't shower or wash her clothes regularly, left dry top ramen noodles all over the floor for me to step on, didn't wash her hands or flush the toilet, sighed in a way that sounded like sex noises constantly, showered with the door open and got water everywhere...and so many more things that I hated. Basically every single pet peeve I had was born in this girl. At first I blamed it on her not understanding American etiquette (she's a foreign student from China). 

But then things started to get creepy. When I went home for the weekend a few weeks into the semester, I gave her a heads up that I would be gone. She did that weird sex sigh again and looked sad and betrayed at the same time, like I was doing something wrong by leaving her. She said something along the lines of ""Why are you leaving me? I don't like sleeping in the room by myself, i feel more comfortable with you here with me."" Mind you I only met this chick on move-in day and only said a few words to her. I should have known to keep my guard up after that. 

Every once in a while she would stare off into space longingly for half an hour. Sometimes I would catch her watching me study out of the corner of my eye. After along day of studying in the library I went to the patio in our dorm to get some ice from the machine and found her with her head on a table with her eyes wide open staring at something in the distance. I think she scared off the guy I like because he stopped coming around to see me once he found out she was my roommate. 

After she creeped me out so much, I started staying away from my dorm, only going to sleep and grab things I needed. She seemed like a nice person, but I couldn't live with her anymore. Today I emailed my RD that I wanted a room change. I told her that I wasn't comfortable living in my dorm anymore with this girl. 

I was sitting in my room while my roommate was out today when I hear a banging on the door. I was then greeted by two solemn looking campus police officers and the RD of my building. they calmly asked me where my roommate was, but I had no idea. I told them her usual lurking spots and went back to what I was doing. I knew something was off. I asked them what was up and they just ignored my question and asked where she might have been. The police officers at my campus are usually really pleasant looking too, since there isn't much crime at my campus and they don't have much to do. 30 minutes later I hear banging on the door again.  I'm greeted by my roommate who has tears streaming down her face. She rushes past me to her bed and plops down. She starts wailing, screaming, and eventually hyperventilating. I thought maybe someone close to her died, and was feeling sorry that I had asked for a room change during her time of need. I could only make out a few bits and pieces of what she was saying to the RD. 
""I'm sorry I didn't mean to...I promise I won't do it again...""

The police officer pulled me aside and quietly asks if there is anything in the room she can hurt herself with. I gesture to her drawer where I know I have seen a small knife with a wooden sheath on occasion. He went through the drawer but didn't find anything. Suddenly she was right behind him screaming.

""Don't you dare go through my things!""
""We don't want you to harm yourself...please calm do-""
 ""You think I'm going to harm my roommate? I wouldn't do that she's just silly! [wtf?] I'm not going to hurt anyone I just want to be left alone!""

By then the RD dragged me out of the room and told me what was going on. She got into a big fight with her best friend (I didn't think she had any) and started sending her threatening emails and even threatened to kill herself. By this time I was in complete shock. I just saw someone completely lose it right in front of me. She told me that she had received my room change request and was going to meet with me tomorrow. I told her I would stay with a friend for the night. 

After my roommate calmed down a bit, I went into the room when two RDs were talking to her to quickly pack a night bag. She apologized for acting so crazy and I half-heatedly accepted, grabbed my shit and got out of there.

I was waiting in my dorm common area for my friend to get back to her dorm when I realized I forgot a blanket. I went inside thinking that someone was going to be in the room keeping an eye over her, but she was alone. She glared at me as I walked past her to grab my blanket. There was pure hatred in her eyes.
""Where are you going?"" I have never heard her use this tone of voice with anyone before. She was livid. 
""I'm gonna stay with my friend for the night.""
""Why? Because of me?"" I swear I saw smoke rising from the top of her head and a vein in her forehead was about to burst.
""Sleepover!"", in the happiest tone I could muster, ""we have a midterm on Friday."" Not completely untrue. I'm just glad I am quick on my feet. 

I got out of there and nearly ran to my friends dorm.  I talked to the RD and there are no more rooms open in my housing complex, and if I want to move to another complex my parents would have to pay an extra 1,000 dollars.  They are furious and want me to move immediately because the police officer was incompetent. He jeopardized my safety by asking me that question in front of her. They don't want to pay for me to change rooms because it was my university's fault for putting me in this awkward position. 

 I'm just afraid that she is going to take this out on me. I don't think I can return to my dorm. She looked like she was out for blood when I came back. 

Tl;dr I thought my college roommate was a bit off, turns out she was batshit crazy.

1359081896.0	178dcb	Why I Leave My Living Room Light On..	SuperMalagator	152	14	14	"I commented on another story about how I never turn my living room light and TV off, which made me remember why... unfortunately. 

I live in the top of a duplex. In order to get inside my apartment you have to go through the bottom steel door, up the twelve stairs and through the flimsy plywood door at the top. When I first moved in I didn't think much of locking the deadbolt, just the door handle. 

One night the door didn't latch (I'm assuming) after my friends had left. I was laying in bed at exactly 4:41 am when I heard my bottom door open. I was almost asleep but it jolted me awake, as I wasn't expecting anyone and my boyfriend was already in bed. I ran to the top door and whipped it open. There, on the seventh step, stood a young man. He was white, had dark shaggy hair, and a hipster beard. He also wore dark framed glasses and a fedora (ridiculous, I know.) 

Angry, I screamed ""WHO ARE YOU AND WHY ARE YOU IN MY HALLWAY?!"" I think I caught him off guard because he began to stammer as he spoke. ""I-I-I was l-looking for N-Naida"" (my boyfriend's mother who has never been to my apartment). I then asked ""Was she supposed to meet you here?"" He just looked at his feet. ""Do you realize what time it is?"" No answer. ""Look at me, you creepy son of a bitch!"" Immediately I regret the words. He looks up at me, smiles and says ""I just thought you were asleep. I'll come back later.""

I fucking lost it and started screaming for my boyfriend. I had up to this point not wanted to wake him up, since he can get pretty grouchy but I was too freaked out. Unfortunately, my boyfriend was not quick enough to see his face.

The next morning, I called Naida and asked her if she had sent anyone to my house or planned to meet anyone there. She sounded very confused and said absolutely not. I explained what he looked like and she still had no idea who he could be. To this day, we don't know but I always make sure the door is latched and locked and the light and TV are on. As far as he's concerned, we never sleep.

TL;DR: Creepy hipster walked in my house, no idea why he was there or who he was.

Edit: Clarification on exactly 4:41am. Anyone who has had someone enter their house or bang on the door in the middle of the night knows that your first instinct is ""What ungodly hour is this?"". So basically I distinctly remember the glow of the alarm clock."	t5_2t3t8	True
1355515104.0	14uwru	Almost an airport abduction	34kitten92	175	36	17	"So this is my second story for this sub, and it also takes place when I was way younger. For some reason, that's the only time creepy things have happened to me. Knock on wood.

I have to preface this story by saying I was a really smart kid when I was little. At 18 months, I knew every word to ""The Bear Necessities"" from The Jungle Book and would perform it for my mom's coworkers. I don't think anyone ever taught me what to do in a situation with a stranger, just not to talk to them. I also have to say that when I was little, around 3-4, my mom let me cut my hair really short, like a boy's and everyone mistook me for one because I refused to wear anything ""girly."" Also, like most small children, I wasn't a good listener.

For some reason, my grandma took me to the airport with her one day when she was watching me. I can't remember if my parent's had gone out of town or if we were picking up someone else and she had to bring me because it was her day to watch me while my parents were at work. Regardless, this was before security in the airports was super tight, so we were headed to a gate to pick whoever it was up. Or maybe we were just out in the main airport and it seemed like we were headed to a gate because I was so much smaller, so everything seemed bigger. Forgive the lack of memory, I was little. 

I do distinctly remember, however, that my grandma scolded me for running ahead of her and told me to not do it again. Five minutes later, I'm at it again. I ran down a small flight of stairs (maybe three or four steps at most) and was suddenly swooped up by a very large man. I remember that he smelled funny and that he had a really scraggly beard and blonde hair and really creepy eyes. He then starts to rush off with me, and I remember being very calm about the whole thing because, in my mind, my grandma was right there and she wouldn't let anyone hurt me.

Well, she came tearing after this guy, faster than I've ever seen her move and she's yelling at him to put me down, and whacking at him with her purse, and he said to her, ""Lady, chill. This is my son, the kid your looking for must have ran off."" That's when little old me pipes up and says, ""I am NOT a boy and you are NOT my daddy. Now put me down."" The guy looked shocked out of his mind and slightly repulsed and promptly put me down and RAN off.

Now, my whole family has talked this story to death. Is it possible this guy really thought I was his son? Was he just someone who made a mistake? Or was he a pedophile who thought he had scooped up a little boy? As a whole, we tend to lean toward pedophile, mostly because of his behavior. He didn't say a word to me, just picked me up and tried to hurry off, and then when it became clear I was a girl he high-tailed it out of there as fast as he could. If he was just a man who had made a simple mistake, he probably would have stuck around and apologized to my grandma for frightening her and for snatching me.

TL;DR: Got snatched up by a potential pedo at the airport and my grandma went crazy old lady on him and smacked him with her handbag, but it was me telling him I was a girl that made him run."	t5_2t3t8	True
1354068197.0	13wr3t	Hey...What are you doing?	GemAdele	161	24	24	"That's what the man in my window said.  This was years ago, and details may blur...but it was terrifying and still haunts me to this day.

I lived in a second story apartment with another girl. We lived above a business, in a commercial district.  I felt *safe*. ...

Until one night when a whisper woke me up from my sleep. He said, very quietly ""Hey.""  I was groggy and processing what I had heard when I heard ""Hey, what are you doing?"" Still whispering. At this point I sat bolt upright in my bed. My mattress was on the floor, and I looked up to see some of the usual street light glow blocked from my view through the crack in my curtain. I slept naked, and I felt particularly vulnerable. I pulled the curtain back a little and saw the shadow of a big man STANDING OUTSIDE MY WINDOW. I yelled ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING AT MY WINDOW I'M GOING TO CALL THE FUCKING COPS!""  I ran out of my room and called 911.  And they were complete dicks about it.

I live on the second floor, and they didn't seem to believe my story. As I was waiting, I was out on my front balcony (the roof of the business below) smoking a cigarette. I just kind of felt better being out there, instead of trapped in my apartment. There was a ledge that ran around the side of the building with our bedroom windows, from the ""porch"" area. I checked back there, maglight in hand, and found no one.  Then I heard some banging from behind the building across the street. It so CLEARLY sounded like somebody climbing up on a dumpster. I sat there frozen, watching the building across the street.  Then I CLEARLY saw someone creep up around that front porch area (similar set up, apartments above a business) and then CLIMB IN A WINDOW.  I lost it.  

When the cops showed up, I told them everything. I even called 911 before they got there and told them what I just witnessed.  Those assholes still didn't believe me. They didn't even check for anyone, or for evidence of my claims.

The next morning, I checked out the area under my window.  I found foot prints (in the snow), and then one of the commercial garbage cans that had been pushed up to the wall under my window. It had a big dent in the top, and was situated under and old satellite dish brace that was sticking out of the wall.  Great.

I slept in my living room for months after that.

1376313921.0	1k7e25	Overnight Bus Creeper	LadyEmry	164	30	30	"This is my first post for Reddit, so hopefully it's good enough. If you want to make any suggestions to improve it, please feel free. :3


Anyway, on with my story. So for a few years between 2009 and 2013, I went backpacking through most of Asia by myself. I had a couple of creepy encounters here and there but the worst one was probably during the overnight bus from Penang, Malaysia to Singapore. I had just started my trip and wasn't aware of the sort of harassment I would occasionally receive from men. I'd overslept and missed my flight so instead had to take an 11 hour bus ride instead. Unfortunately the date I took it was the ending of school holidays in Malaysia so most bus companies were completely booked out. I finally found one and paid a ridiculous price for a ""premium"" bus ticket. When we finally boarded at around 7pm I discovered that the bus was extremely cramped and dirty, covered with cockroaches running around the seats and along the walls. I turned my thongs (flip flops) into a makeshift cockroach swatter and settled in for the long ride. I'd been told we wouldn't get to Singapore until about 7am.

The man next to me was Asian, around late thirties to early forties. He was very interested in me, asking me many questions about where I was going (I told him Singapore), was I alone, where I would be staying, how old I was, did I have a boyfriend... I made awkward but polite small talk with him, making up a fictional boyfriend. Eventually it got late and we both tried to get some sleep. Fear of the cockroaches kept me awake though, so I spent an hour or so just lying there with my eyes closed attempting sleep when I felt a hand brush against my left thigh. I ignored it, since maybe it was an accident. Maybe his hand had just slipped from the armrest? I felt it again, squeezing my leg, then the hand moved to my right thigh. Ah. Not an accident. 

I opened my eyes and he quickly drew his hand back. I asked him to please stop and rolled over in my seat to try and sleep again. This time after a few minutes I felt his hand rub my back and grasp my ass, I shifted away further and he stopped. He left me alone for awhile and I thought it was fine. Up until I felt him shift closer to me and realised he was sniffing my neck and making moaning sounds. I rolled over and told him to cut it out. He left me alone for the rest of the trip. Phew! Dodged a bullet, I thought.

I managed to get a tiny bit of sleep then awoke at 6.30am when the bus stopped. The man shook my shoulder and told me ""C'mon! Get out! It's Singapore!"" The time seemed right so groggy, I hopped off the bus and went up to the bus conductor to get my luggage. Luckily for me he remembered I was travelling to Singapore, as he told me to get back on the bus- this was still Malaysia, we hadn't crossed the border yet. Singapore was the next stop. 

I turned around to see the man staring at me from a large group of men clustering around the bus and very quickly boarded the bus again. As we drove away I wondered if he'd done that deliberately- then I remembered that I had told him Singapore was my destination the night before, and he knew this wasn't Singapore. Not that I would've gone anywhere with him but still, creepy that he tried it.


tl;dr creepy dude tried to get me off the bus at the wrong stop for whatever reason. Your guess is as good as mine."	t5_2t3t8	True
1367000979.0	1d63qn	My peeping neighbour	krissee	170	31	37	"I lived in Wetaskiwin Alberta and when i first moved there (April 2008) until he moved (2010), we had a neighbor who was a bane to our existence.

It all started when, one day, I was taking the garbage out to the bin. On my way back I happened to look up and saw, no word of a lie, 9 video cameras in this man's backyard. He had 1 above his back door, 1 on the railing of the back steps, 1 on a pole by the back steps, 1 on the receiver for his satellite, 1 on his back gate, 3 on his fence and one in an upstairs window. Now the amount kind of creeped me out but what really creeped me out was that 5 out of the 9 cameras were pointed at my backyard. Oh did i forget to mention that I have 3 young children? Well I pointed this out to my husband and we called the landlord right away who called the cops and they all went there and told him to remove the cameras that were facing my yard. Then the trouble REALLY started. He killed 2 of my cats, threw a dead skunk in my backyard, yelled at my kids for playing and threatened to kill one of the cats in front of my kids then had the audacity to call the cops on my husband for yelling at him.

Not long after the cops came to our house and put a verbal peace bond on us, I was sleeping on the couch due to me having a broken arm. I turned off the light and settled in waiting for the Advil to kick in when I looked at my living room window and who should i see there? My creeper of a neighbor! I screamed and Morgan came running downstairs. By this time my neighbor had already ran back to his place.

He finally moved out 2010 when he realized he couldn't get rid of us and shortly after we had a fire in our townhouse and had to move into his old unit. We found out why he had all those cameras. We were moving some stuff downstairs and saw he had built a room.... He had a grow op for marijuana in his basement that no one new about. I now live on an acreage outside of Wetaskiwin and I am so happy to not be there anymore."	t5_2t3t8	True
1365320716.0	1budfb	My alcoholic mother - sexual abuse, secrets, and guilt over last words said to her	anonymousthrowaway21	175	39	35	"This is really long.  Sorry.  Wall of text.

For a little background on me I'm a 23 year old male who has long surpressed memories and things about my mother and abuse I endured with her as she battled alcoholism.


When I was younger I was awkward and had horrible self esteem because of what I endured with my mother.  She had been an alcoholic from the time she was 18 to her death in 2009 at the age of 53.  From everything I've heard the longest period she ever went without drinking was when she was pregnant with me.  Growing up I remember my parents fighting a lot and I didn't understand why.  As most kids do I assumed it was my fault.  My dad would hear that she picked me up from daycare drunk and yell at her pretty aggressively and being too young to really understand what that meant assumed it was my fault.  I was really young and don't remember these memories vividly but I can distinctly remember feelings, if that makes any sense at all.  So that's really the first memories I can remember when her alcoholism directly affected me emotionally.  


As I got older(probably around kindergarten or first grade) I began to notice that there were two different versions of my mom.  This sounds weird but I really remember thinking about it as if she were two different people.  One was my normal mom.  The other was that slurred and couldn't walk straight.  I remember asking both of my parents what was going on and one day my dad sat me down and told me she was sick.  She had a sickness called alcoholism.  

Now, despite all of this I was really close to my mom as a child.  My dad worked long hours even had to leave the country for long periods of time in the air force.  Because I was close to her I would often sleep in her bed stretched across the door of it.  Because of marriage problems due to her drinking my dad slept on the couch(and continued doing this until she died).  One night I remember very clearly was I was laying beside her so I could watch TV.  My dad wasn't home and I remember she roller over on her side and looked at me.  She then pulled her shirt up and put my hands on her breasts.  I had no idea what was going on.  To some degree i liked it due to the curiosity factor but I also felt wrong.  I had no sense of sexuality at that age but part of me knew this wasn't right.  The next part really messed me up for a while.  As she places my hands there she starts telling me that the preacher says boys who touch their moms go to hell.  I seriously don't remember how that ended or anything about the subsequent days.  I had forgotten all of it until this resurfaced in my head about a year ago, but I can trace a lot of weird feelings I had for a long time back to that.  Most of my childhood that I remember is very much bits and pieces and in no chronological order whatsoever.


Another memory I have(and I have no earthly idea if this is prior to the above incident or after it) was my mother taking a bath with me.  Apparently she had told me she'd do it before it happened because I remember that day I was swimming and her and my grandparents were with us.  Again, not having much of a sense of sexuality I mentioned it in front of them and I remember my grandfather having a really weird look and my mom said something(I don't remember what) and they bought it I guess.  The only thing I remember from the bath is her sitting nude across from me.  I'm really afraid that maybe I repressed something bad that happened.


The last sexual incident I remember I was , probably around 5th grade.  I got off the bus and I remember when I walked in something just felt wrong.  About that time she comes out of her bedroom and starts raising her shirt and I immediately run and lock my door.  She starts banging on it saying boys are supposed to touch their mom.  I remember crying incredibly hard and staying in there until my dad got home.  My mom and I never discussed this.  Her probably thinking I forgot.

I never told anyone about this, even ex girlfriends or my current girlfriend.  Although I don't connect my sexuality with these incidents I'm really afraid they would.  Part of me thinks that when we're fooling around or showering together it might pop into their head and ruin things.  And I don't want them to, because I don't.  I don't dwell on this because if I do have some repressed memories they're repressed for a reason.  My biggest issue with this is wrapping my head around the fact that I was molested and forgot about it for over a decade.

Now I'll get into some more abuse.  Since I really can't piece together a narrative I'm just trying to tell about one kind of abuse at a time.  In addition to the sexual abuse I got a wide range of emotional abuse.  After I started understanding what alcoholism is I would get angry with her.  When I'd come home and she was drunk I would feel betrayed and would more or less sull up in the following days.  I guess in a way to combat that my mom said it was her nerves and blamed things I did for making her nervous and forcing her to self medicate.  This REALLY fucked me up for a while because she would use things I did as an excuse to drink.  If I brought home a bad grade on a test she'd say she got nervous and drink. If I got in trouble.  Basically anything I did was the cause and it really made me feel really guilty.  

My dad had told me that they might get a divorce soon because of this problem and told me if they split up they'd still love me just as much.  Because I thought I was the cause of her drinking I began lying to my dad and telling him nothing.  If he got home late and she was passed out I'd say she was just sleeping.  If she was drunk and awake when he got home I would lie and say she didn't drive with me drunk.  If he knew about 1% of the stuff that happened he would have divorced her and got me out of there in a heartbeat.

One example I remember of her using guilt on me that caused me great embarrassment in school happened when I failed to turn in homework for like the third time in sixth grade and the teacher told me she was going to call my mom.  I lost it and started crying and begging her not to because she would drink(in front of the whole class).  The teacher said it wasn't her problem and that it's my fault for not doing my homework.  So here's a second adult placing the blame on me.  I get home and of course she's drunk and blames me.

Another memory I have of her is when she was in a different town so that she could attend AA meetings.  She had an apartment and since they had these accountability buddies and she had no car my dad would take me there on the weekends to stay.  I don't remember if she stayed sober or not.  Probably not though.  Well one night I got up to go to the bathroom and she was asleep in a chair on top of another man, also asleep.  I remember getting way way upset because I knew this wasn't right.  I made kind of a loud whining sound and ran away which woke them up.  He immediately for up and left and she fed me some lie like they were so tired they just fell asleep and fell into the chair.  I was probably 7 so while I think part of me knew she was lying and I didn't want to believe it.  My dad doesn't know this happened.  A few years later I'm in the car with them and they see some lady and my mom remarks a dislike for her and when my aunt asked why she says the lady lied and told my dad she cheated on him while in this other town.  This triggered that memory and I finally put the pieces together.  I've never ever told my dad.  


There was another incident I don't know the whole story to because I was so young and I'm not going to ever ask about it.  She was in another town, attending AA, and working in wal mart to pay for her apartment(which, like several jobs, she got fired for showing up drunk to).  We couldn't find her when we came to visit one weekend and I remember that night he found her drunk walking with another man to his car.  My dad gets mad and tells her to come with us.  The other guy starts to stand up for her but my dad tells him that's his wife and I guess the guy realizing what's going on and seeing a petrified me there and backs off.  I don't know if she was going to cheat with someone she just met, if she had already been seeing, or if maybe she was just going to a bar or something.  And I'll never ask my dad what he knows.

Another traumatizing experience was there had been a news story where a mother had drowned her children on TV.  I was probably about 8 and she drove to a peer told me that I didn't love her and she was going to drive us both off a bridge.  I cried and begged her not to.  She eventually turned around and went home.

There's a ton more stories but this is already pretty long so I'll tell the story of her death. On a Wednesday when I was away at college I got a call that my dad had a heart attack and was being rushed to the hospital.  He wound up living and that Friday when my mom was there she had to go to the ER where they told her she had to get her gallbladder removed.  So she had surgery that day and they discharged my dad that Saturday.  Since she couldn't drive anymore(2 DUIs got her license suspended) the decision was made for my dad to stay with some more family and me to stay there for the 1-2 days until they discharged her and bring her home.  And it was a very nice stay with her.  We talked a lot(about my senior year of HS I began distancing myself from her becausei sincerely expected her to die and I didn't want it to hurt - she was incredibly underweight due to a combination of anorexia, passing out for days and missing meals, and I'm pretty sure bulimia since I'm pretty sure towards the end I caught her gagging herself with a toothbrush several times).  She seemeds different.  Like she had finally had a real scare.  She promised me she'd watch my dad closely.  So she comes home on Sunday and I go back to college.  I called every night that week(something I never did before) and everything seemed fine.  They were getting along and it just seemed like a way more pleasant vibe than I'm used to.  So Friday after classes I come home so I can help out some for the weekend.  I notice my mom is a little off but I'm like ""she can't be messed up - my dads been off work all week and she couldn't have gotten it or gotten someone to take it"".  Some things were still odd - she INSISTED on me going to get her an orange Fanta, which i do.  


So I go to see some friends for a while once they're settled and I get home around midnight. I see a light on in her room and know something's up.  I go in there and she's so messed up she couldn't even talk.  I look on her dresser and I see a bottle for lortab(due to her surgery) and I realize she took a bunch to ger high.  I know that the tylenol can be fatal to the liver and is probably double dangerous to a liver ravaged by drug abuse.  So I'm pissed and decide I'm going to to carry her to my car and take her to the ER. I go wake my dad up on the couch and tell him. So I'm putting shoes on her and I snapped.  I went off on her.  I told her she was a horrible mother, a crappy wife, a terrible person and I hated her.  At this time she's moving around a lot and pointing at her mouth and trying it stick things in it but I just assume she's just really fucked up. 



I went to my car to move a box I had in my passenger seat so I could carry her and sit her in there.  When I got back in her room I wish I could put into words the quietness I felt.  I walked in the room and I felt like I was alone in it.   So I walk over to her and watch her stomach for a second and see its not moving.  I freak out and call my dad saying I think she's not breathing.  He runs in there and looks and agrees.  He tells me to call 911 and I do.  I tell them what's going on and they say get her off the bed.  I do and when I pick her up vomit pours out of her.  It looks like that fanta I bought her.  Knowing my dads heart and I tell him to go outside and make sure the ambulance didn't miss our house. The dispatcher tells me to perform CPR until the ambulance gets there.  Right as I start I realize her eyes are open and I knew she was gone.  She had dead eyes with no human behind them - this haunted me for a while and still sometimes does on random occasions.  I remember doing CPR and feeling her rib cage bend under my push and the sound of the pressure trying to push more vomit or something through her throat.  To this day I can't watch anything that involves CPR.  The paramedics got there and there was nothing they could do.  They said she drowned on her own vomit.  And I realized I watched her die.  I watched her as she was telling me what was going on and in her final moments she heard how much I resented her.  The last thing she ever heard was I hate you as she drowned on her own vomit which was likely a drink I gave her.  So I feel guilt over that.  I also feel guilt over my emotion when it was over.  When the ambulance left with her body I felt relief.  No more wondering when me or my dad would find her dead.

And then as I started unearthing some of these memories it really messed with me.  I want to feel sadness.  I want to mourne.  And sometimes I even do.  But sometimes I think about her and I'm glad she's dead.  This is a contrast to my dad who decided to latch on to the positive memories.  So I can't really discuss this with him on a surface level.

TL;DR - I suffered emotional and sexual abuse from an alcoholic mother who I eventually unknowingly watched die as I told her I hated her.

Sorry for all typos and errors.  And for it being so long.  I left out a lot of stuff like things she'd call me when angry as a child, suicide attempts in front of me or knowing I would almost surely be the one to find her body.  Alone.  Stuff like that."	t5_2t3t8	True

We returned to our car and were about to leave when a guy suddenly appeared by the driver's side window.   He did the ""roll down your window"" cranking motion.   Curious, my husband did so, but only a crack - this guy seemed fairly normal, with a genial smile on his face, but he was in shirtsleeves on a frigid January day, so we were a bit cautious.

He started asking us about ourselves - were we in love?   ""Yes,"" we answered.   ""Ah, that's wonderful.   Are you married?""   ""Yes, we are.""   ""Ah, that's lovely.   Any children?""   ""Not yet.""

That's when his entire demeanor changed.   Do you remember when Bilbo Baggins wanted his ring back in ""Fellowship of the Ring"", and his face morphed?   I swear, that's what happened with this guy.   He hissed ""DON'T.   CHILDREN RUIN YOUR LIFE.""

1356684448.0	15kdv7	"""White chocolate is my fave."""	MidnightOfcourse	173	39	26	"UPDATE: http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/15lxt1/white_chocolate_is_my_fave_the_update/


I have only had a few creepy experiences in my life. Two of which I have posted on here, but nothing that scared me as intensely as this.


Last week, I was out accompanying a friend who was doing some shopping for Christmas. All was normal, crowded stores with outrageous lines at the cash registers, nothing else significant until we went down the candy aisle. My friend, Veronica is looking at the different assortments of chocolates while I just standing there looking down at the floor. I must have been lost in thought or simply not paying attention because I didn't hear someone approach me. 


""So, you like chocolate?"" A man asked. I thought he was talking to Veronica, considering she was the one looking at the chocolate. I looked up and he was looking at me, waiting for an answer to his question.


""Uh...yeah..."" I am a talkative person but when it comes to strangers I am the most socially inadequate person. He smiles and takes a step closer to me.


""Mmm...me too...white chocolate is my fave. Never been into the dark myself."" He says this while dragging his eyes from my feet to my head. Then licks his lips and smiles. He was maybe 30 years old, tall, appeared to be fit, and was decently cute, no reason to be creeped out by his appearance. 


""ha..."" I try to scoot on closer to Veronica and start a conversation with her so that I wouldn't have to be in awkward conversation with him. 


""Hmm...I think you are my new fave. See ya later, toots."" He walked by me and slid into another aisle. I looked at Veronica and she looked at me before asking if I knew him. I'd never seen the guy in my life.

 
Fast forward a day after that, I am heading up to the store in my small town. As I pull up I see the guy from the other store. He is walking out minding his own, but me being worried I'd end up in an awkward situation again, I start to pull out. I head out to a local carry out and pick up a few items. I am gone for about 20 minutes total. I get home and as I walk up to my door, I hear a car pull in my drive way. I share a driveway with my two neighbors so I figured it was just them. 


I'm inside when I hear my sliding door open. The door handle jingles once then twice. Worried that whoever it is will see me bend a blind to look out the door, I go to the side window facing the driving way. I peek out and see a blue truck sitting there. Maybe it was a mistaken address? I watch the truck for a few seconds waiting to catch a glimpse of the driver. The driver finally gets off my back porch and heads for his truck and I see his face. It's the same guy from both stores! Given, I did not give this guy my address. I start wondering if he followed me here without my realizing it, or maybe it was a coincidence and he mistakenly came to my house. 


He leaves and for the next few hours I am in my house by myself watching tv and cruising the web. I decide to go out and get the mail since I was expecting some electronics and didn't want them sitting out in the cold. I slip my shoes on and jacket and unlock the front door. I walk down to the mail box and get my stuff. I go to head back when a vehicle starts driving down the road (it was dark out so I couldn't see exactly what it was till it was closer), I just keep walking for the door paying no mind. 


The vehicle stops in front of my house and I walk even faster trying to reach the door. Right as I grab the door handle I hear someone yelling. I couldn't make out what they said, but I turned around to see who it was. The same guy is sitting in his truck with the window down looking at me. He smiles then yells out, ""I've been looking for you!"" He actually parks his truck in the road and starts to get out of the truck. I mumble something about having to go and bolt in the house. I go to lock the door. The door has three locks. A chain lock, dead bolt, and door knob lock.


I always lock the locks in order from chain, dead, then door knob because that is the order they are in from top to bottom. I start to lock the doors as usual as fast as I can, but I only get the chain locked when I feel a force push on the door. I was in full force panic and shoved against the door as hard as I could. I figured being a bit of a chubby gal I could overcome him. He pushed harder and the door flew open as far as the chain lock would along. He stuck his face up in the space and started to say a bunch of odd shit.


""Oh I have been waiting so long. You can't lock me out now. Let me come in. Always fighting me aren't you? Why do you have to always fight me!? Let's work this out, toots! I know you love me, just show me!"" Things of that assortment started spilling out of his mouth. I didn't know what he was talking about! I did what any normal person would do, I punched him in the face. He flew back a few inches and I took the opportunity to slam the door and dead bolt it. I realize now I should have dead bolted the door first but out of habit I made the mistake of doing the chain first. 


I called the cops and within an hour they were there looking around. Of course, the guy was gone. I gave them a description and told them the weird shit he was saying to me while he was trying to get in my house. They basically said to call if he comes back and good luck. I guess there wasn't anything they could really do. I mentally reminded myself to get a license plate number if it happened again. My mother finally came home and the news didn't settle well with her. We slept downstairs that night with the phone right by our sides.


The next morning is when the phone calls started. This guy left a dozen messages. I wrote down the entire message from a couple of them. I saved them on my voice mail, I'm not sure if there is a way I could pop them up on here. Anyways, one of them went as follows (if some of it doesn't make sense, bare with me, I tried to make out all the words)


""Hey toots (he loves this word apparently)! I miss you. I love you. I really want to know what it feels like inside you. Mmm...sweet chocolate baby of mine. I think you're the one for me to enjoy and play for keeps (that part is mumbly so not sure if he said 'play for keeps' or 'mine to keep') and just love. I hope you don't let another man take what's mine, I won't be happy, toots! You can only have me inside you, only me and my everything (once again, not sure if it's 'everything' or something else). I am tired of fighting, always fighting me, fighting just makes it harder on you, yanno? Just pick up, come outside, just come to me in two ways, if you know what I am saying, toots...of course you know. You know me."" 


Most of the messages are along those lines, this was the most non-vulgar one. The others get pretty descriptive and nasty. I called the cops again but they couldn't do anything (well that's what they told me) so I had to deal. With Christmas coming up, I didn't want to worry about something like this. I had NEVER dealt with something this intense. Never been stalked mildly or severely in my life. 
Yeah, I have had a couple creepy experiences but nothing like this. 


He kept calling up until Christmas Eve, then he just stopped. I hadn't been going outside by myself or even going out shopping with friends so I wasn't sure if he was lurking around my house. I thought I seen a blue truck drive by a few times during the days he was calling but it was always at dark that I'd see it and the neighbor down the road also drives a blue truck so I can't say for certain if it was him. Either way, I thought all this weird crazy bullshit was done. 


I'll post my next experience about him, this one is insanely long and I feel like it gets overwhelming to read if it goes on and on. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1356154803.0	159p3i	Just Little Things (Humorous, but still definitely creepy)	valiantscamp	168	30	16	"To preface, this happened when I was a kid in my single digits. This didn't really happen to me so much as it happened to my father, but I was definitely around the house at this point. My parents are divorced and I would go between homes on a weekly basis. My father had recently moved into a small house on a dead-end street.

My dad woke up early one morning to go for a run as he usually did (seeing as he was a marathon runner). He went to put on his usual running gear which was where he had left it the previous day, only to discover that his favorite pair of running sneakers and his old Boston U hoodie were not where he usually kept them. He looked all around the house, and to his dismay, the items were nowhere to be found. Shrugging, he figured he left them at his friend's place after the last race he went to. 

Later on in the week, he gets home from work and goes to the fridge to pour himself a cold glass of milk. The milk is not there. He swore he used it in the cereal that morning. Oh well. He cracks open a beer and tries to think nothing of it, although it does seem a little odd. He really remembered having most of a carton that morning... Now that he thought of it, he also remembers other minor things having gone missing lately; a roll of quarters for parking, toilet paper, a toothbrush. He just chalks it up to forgetfulness, and tries to ignore the slight feeling of unease.

The next day, it's time for little kid me to come for a visit. Dad goes grocery shopping and makes sure to get my favorite frozen ravioli, because kid me loved that shit. Dad puts the groceries away, putting my ravioli in the freezer, and heads out to go pick me up from my mom's.

We get home and Dad goes to make me dinner. He opens the freezer and lo and behold, the ravioli are gone. He KNOWS he just bought them earlier in the day, so his mind is not playing tricks on him. Dad's a skeptical, rational guy, so despite the weird little petty thefts being significant in themselves, acknowledges that someone must be entering the house.

Dad figures it wouldn't be a bad idea to call the local police station. ""Well, officers, I know this is going to sound silly, but I'm missing a pair of sneakers, an old Boston University hoodie, a gallon of milk, a box of frozen ravioli. Someone's been taking some things out of the house,"" he says, a bit ashamedly. He hears a chuckle over the line. ""I know, it's not major, but just keep an eye out for me. I'll let you know if anything else goes missing.""

Maybe a week passes. The strange occurrences seem to slow down, and Dad begins to forget they even happened, that is, until he receives a phone call. It's the local police, and this is what the officer on the line said:

""We found your man. He was walking around town wearing your hoodie, sneakers, and was carrying a plastic bag with your jug of milk and ravioli in it.""

It turns out that the previous owners of the house were not very savory people. The man ended up being the son of the woman who owned the house before us. He was mentally unstable, on and off various drugs, and staying in a halfway house some miles away. Apparently he would walk to the house, wait around for my dad to leave, and steal small items from the home. We never really knew what the motivation was. It was still really creepy that he was around, watching, and with a child (me) around to boot. I never found out what his motivation was, but he did end up with minor jail time and I believe was relocated to a farther distance away."	t5_2t3t8	True
1345554549.0	yktra	The Fire	hellpony	165	27	31	"Last November, my grandfather, my mom's father, passed away.  Throughout the course of my life, he'd always been my favorite person, a best friend and a source of guidance through my wayward teenage years.  Emotionally, I was drained.  

My dad's family, with whom my relationship was strained at best, had never bothered to contact me or comfort me.  I was angry.  I had never been particularly fond of them nor they of me, but this was too much.  I posted a Facebook status telling them I didn't want to be part of the family anymore, that they'd crossed the line and not to bother speaking to me or sending me birthday cards again.

I knew the post would be controversial.  The first response came in message form from a girl I'd gone to high school with and only vaguely knew.

She told me she was proud of me for standing up to my family and that she'd gone through something similar with hers.  We agreed to meet up for drinks that week.

We went to the local concert venue for some drinks and really hit it off.  As the alcohol started to take effect, we got even closer.  Eventually, we met up once a week to get drinks.  She'd crash at my house often, due to some problems with her family.  We became best friends and emotional support for each other as we dealt with twentysomething girl problems.

Months down the road, she was supposed to move in with a friend of her ex's, but not wanting to have to deal with his occasional visits and with potentially keeping tabs on her, we decided to get a place of our own.  My grandpa's death had left me with a small inheritance.  I bought an old trailer to restore and move into with my best friend.

We spent weeks painting and trying to restore the trailer.  I decorated it with all of the cute kitschy vintage stuff I'd acquired over the years.  We were told once that it looked dollhouse-perfect.

We both met guys at the same time and fell hard for them.  We'd always joke about how we were perfect best friends because our taste in men was so vastly different, to the point at which she'd see guys she thought were particularly ugly and know they were perfect for me.  Her boyfriend was an ex-marine (she had even drunkenly lied to him that she was a marine, too).  He was large, quiet, and frankly, kind of strange.  My dude gave me some furniture from his old house, and, as we were moving it in, the ex-marine sat at our kitchen table wearing a towel and nothing else, his dog stalking around our feet, seeking an ear scratch.  

In my bedroom, I confessed to my dude that the guy did this frequently, making himself so much at home in my trailer that my roommate would have to remind him to put a towel on to walk into my kitchen.  The dog was over all the time, meaning I could never bring my mom's dog to visit.  I was uncomfortable with the situation but never enough to do anything more than joke about it with my roommate.  There were other things she did that were the cause for problems, like stealing my clothes out of my closet and never putting them back, smoking cigarettes in the kitchen instead of outside, and bingeing on the groceries that should have lasted us for weeks.  I bitched about it to my dude to vent, but never said anything to her.  Even though we had our respective prince charmings, we were still very close.

Throughout the beginning of this very hot summer, we'd sun ourselves and smoke cigarettes or lie around the living room on our respective computers in our underwear, taunting our boyfriends.  Then, my roommate started to change.

She cut her hair so that she'd have bangs and dyed it black, very much like my own hair.  Bruises peppered her limbs, large, impossible-to-miss blemishes she said came from the awesome, rough sex she'd have with the marine.  She'd be quiet and moody and her visits became more and more infrequent.  She'd tell me about the dreams she was having, once telling me, ""I dreamed I buried a woman to her neck in sand and drowned her in the tide.""  The ex-marine took her fishing and she confessed she loved the feeling of killing something small and helpless.  She posted pictures of the turtle she'd killed for soup on Facebook.

It was around the end of the month, when rent was due, when she disappeared completely.  My parents and I both tried to ask her what was going on and where the rent money was, but she didn't reply.  A week later, she told me she was going to rehab for her drinking problem and for things to do with her eating disorder, that she'd broken up with the marine, but a very recent Facebook check-in at a bar with him told me otherwise.

I felt betrayed that she'd lied to me.  One of my friends, who was thinking about moving in to the now empty room, came over to help me put her stuff in bags.  She suggested that since I was forced to pay the extra half of rent (an almost impossible task for the minimum wage job I held), and because we found more and more and more of my missing clothes in my ex-roommate's room, that I keep some of hers. So I did.

I felt guilty, but figured that when she came to pick up the rest of her stuff, we could talk about it.  Unfortunately, I came home one day to find the back door pried open(!) and all of her stuff gone.  I was furious about the damage to the door and that she wouldn't even face me.
Two weeks later, I had mostly moved on.  I was angry about losing my best friend, but I still had my dude.

One night, I arrived home from work, on the phone with him.  He was asking me to come over, but I kind of wanted to stay home, smoke weed, and work on some art I wanted to finish.  But I half-begrudgingly agreed to head over to his place for the night.
When he went to work the next morning around 7:30, he told me it would be okay if I wanted to sleep in and stay at his place for a while, but I longed for my own bed.  I got into the car and headed home.

The first thing I noticed when I unlocked the door was the smell.  Gas.  Did I leave the stove on?  No, I had no food.  I walked over to it.
The walls and ceiling were black with fire damage.  A pile of something was still smoking on the stovetop.  Magazines, I realized, and scraps of my clothing.  Two of the four burners were turned all the way up.  I turned them off.

I scrambled to my bedroom first.  My Macbook Pro had been smashed with a hammer, a direct message to me that this was not a burglary.  My $1500 DSLR camera and set of lenses, as well as my Kindle, were gone. Some of the stuff I'd kept of hers was piled by the door with my most expensive Xbox games (her boyfriend had an Xbox), and all of the smoke detectors had been ripped down.  Most of my clothes had been stolen.  A bag of his dog food I'd tucked into a cabinet was pulled out and sitting on the counter.

I felt sick.  My vision blurred.  The first thing my panicky brain had me do was call my father, who of course told me to call the police before coming over immediately.  The fire department brought two firetrucks, extinguished the remaining flames, and dragged the stove out of the trailer.  A cop took the report.  

Eventually, everyone left.  I threw as much of things I'd need as I could into a suitcase and, unable to stay in the ruins of my home any longer, went to my mother's house.

The police took my computer and my point-and-shoot camera as evidence.  From what I hear, this means I'll never see them again.  The damage to the trailer was too extensive (about $25,000), and the insurance company declared it a total loss.  It has since been scrapped.  They covered the damage to the trailer, but because my mother had paid for it as a gift to me, refused to pay for my stuff.

Everything I had has been lost.  I got a new laptop for my birthday, and I'm very thankful, but it's not a Macbook Pro, and all of my precious photography and music files are in evidence lockup.
I was in a car accident soon after.
I'm trying to find a new place to live, but with the nearby universities, right now, it's almost impossible.  Everything of any sort of value that I owned and have worked for since I was sixteen years old is gone.  I'm angry everyday.  
I haven't heard from the ex-roommate or her boyfriend.  Or the cops, for that matter.

1344705628.0	y1yq1	Not in front of my cubs	kawi_grl125	167	30	13	"I owned a small resale shop in the quaint town of Mount Dora, Fl. It's a little tourist area known for antiques and crafts fairs. It's generally older people (typical Fl) but my store was a children's consignment shop, catering to people who do not want to pay the high prices of retail.
 
To give you an idea of the layout, it was around 800sq feet, you entered the door and to the left was the register against the back wall behind the counter. If you are behind the register, you are basically pinned against the wall. To the right of the register was my ""back room"" where my kids would hang out, watch tv and would nap. The building was facing the main road but there were houses behind us. The house directly behind my shop was occupied by a sweet couple who were Snow Birds so they only lived there in the winter time. He was always coming by and saying good morning, talking to the children, calling my young lady, ect. I'm 5 foot, 110lbs, I look young and I like to dress nice at work (skirts, heels). I had friends tell me their first impresion of me was a ""girlie girl"" or vulnerable because of the way I look/dress. In reality, I grew up with 5 brothers, I ride dirtbikes with the guys and like to fight/wrestle with our friends, more for self defense practice.

One day after lunch, I had my 10 month old and my 1yr old nephew napping in the backroom, my 3year old was sitting by the door on a bean bag chair playing his DS. I was tagging clothing and helping customers. Typical afternoon..
 Then the door opened and this guy walked in. Right away, I could feel something was not right. Ocassionally we had men come in but mostly it was with their gf/wife, not many single guys came in. He was dirty, disheveled, had wild looking eyes. He just felt...not right. The whole atmosphere changed when he came in.
   I'm not one to judge so I greet him as I do everyone else and ask ""How are you doing today?""
  He stood in the entranceway looking from my son (sitting 3 feet away from him) back to me, back to my son again. 
  ""I'm alright"" he replied almost annoyed.
  ""Just alright?"" I joked. I was trying to make light of the tension I could feel. He doesn't answer and just keeps looking from my boy to me. I could almost hear his thoughts...it was if he was rethinking his plan because there was a child there. Is he the type of person willing to hurt a child to get what he wants? 

 I'm thinking to myself that he doesn't know there are two babies sleeping in the next room and that I was prepared to fuck his shit up if he even tried anything in front of my son. He just stands there, not looking around at anything, contemplating his next move.

 I picked up the phone casually and called the house behind me, faking a problem so Bob would come over. His wife tells me he isn't home but I pretended like he was on the way over.

 The guy hears me and literally ran out the door, I breathe a sign of relief, hugged my little guy and closed early that day. 
It was almost two years ago but I can still feel that vibe from that day, how it felt like I might have had fight for my life. And how a man almost got his ass handed to him by a 5 foot girl defending her babies."	t5_2t3t8	True
1342312945.0	wklxt	Pen Pal Girl Wants ME!	1TimeThrowie	189	53	55	"I am a regular redditor who has been lurking on different subs, especially this one. I have contributed to a lot of other (with main of course) but I think it's a good time to share my experience. 

Back in grade 5 and 6, all schools across my part of area had to participate in pen pal writing and so on. Being the typical kid, we were a bit nervous at first but as time passed, it became easier and easier to write to our pen pals. My first pen pal who's first name was Dom was very pleasant but seemed as though he didn't have any interest in writing long emails/letters. He seemed like a good guy and at the end of the year (grade 5), we went on an excursion (or field trip) to a local forest with our pen pals. All of us had a good time (except for the awkwardness) and some of us even kept writing to each other (and later facebook). 

In grade 6, we were again, assigned pen pals and this time I had a girl as my pen pal. Her nickname was Minty so we will just call her that on this thread. As soon as I read her first letter to me, I was quite amazed at her incredible grammar and formatting skills. Her handwriting was beyond neat and she always wrote a lot. I admit, half of it wasn't interesting but I still read it through boredom. 

The letters go forth and back and after 1 month, we are writing on a regular basis. I'll admit I wanted to see her in person and maybe be her boyfriend (grade 6 logic) but I knew that wasn't an option so I started to slow down my letters and emails to her. Bad move. She started sending in 2 or 3 emails a day and maybe a letter every couple of days. I replied to them of course, but I kept my distance, wary not to make her think she's not in my friend zone. 

Her letters and emails get more and more directed at me, asking me how my life is, have I had a girlfriend and if I'd smoked before etc. This shook me to the spine and I, being a grade 6 kid, did not report this to any teacher. I decided not to reply for a few days, to see if she lost interest in me. Nope. She began drawing love hearts and kisses next to her signature. I was slightly creeped out. Worst thing was, at the end of the year, all the pen pal buddies had to go on a combined trip to a forest/lake etc. I did NOT want to meet her. 

I later told my best friend Anthony (Tony) about her and after about 5 minutes of talking to Tony about her, I felt safer and better. I started to feel like a 11 year old again. Tony never got good pen pal buddies (rarely wrote) so I told him we could share our buddy. He agreed happily and for the next few weeks, I had nothing to do with Minty. She was out of my life. Until Tony came up to me during class one day and told me about her trying to know where I lived (or we). This was actually starting to become funny instead of creepy (for 11 year olds ofc). Tony and I started to go along with it, telling her fake addresses and fake information about ourselves, claiming to be the sons of a billionaire and what not. She soaked it up like a sponge. Minty started asking if she could come over. We said no. She asked why. We told her lies. This went on for a long period of time and she never got tired of asking and getting lied to. 

Over the next 9 months, Tony and I still told her lies and she still never gave up asking if she could come over to our place. There was the occasional sexual joke in the letters but none of it too explicit (mainly sent by her).

Skip ahead to the last 2 weeks of primary school, everyone is getting ready to meet their pen pals and Tony and I are shitting ourselves. I remember clearly that everytime I woke up, I would feel really anxious and nervous. Also, every pen pal got limited information about their partners and my birthday was coming up real quick. Minty did not hesitate to ask me if I was going to have a birthday party. Then she asked me the most disturbing thing out of all the letters/emails she sent to me. Minty asked me, Cameron, if I wanted to have sex with her since I was turning 12. I am still too stupid and immature to not report this. I brushed it off as a surprise joke so I said something along the lines like ""What does a sex mean?"" or something like that. Minty promised she'd show me and I finally told her ""no"", firmly. She did not reply for the next week. 

On the day of the excursion, I remember funnily that I was trying to bruise myself in the eye so I wouldn't have to go on the excursion. It felt funny punching/slapping my face but my parents, being strict, told me to piss off to school and learn something so I can become a doctor when I grow up. I arrive to school and I literally, wet my pants. There is a girl beckoning me to go over to the school gates (obviously Minty) and I reluctantly go to her. She looks pretty (brown hair, hazel eyes), but her personality and aura set me off a distance. She would often stare at your mouth and not reply to anything you just said. We talked for about 10 minutes and I asked her politely how she knew who/what I looked like. She didn't reply to that and she asked me again, if I wanted to have sex with her. I told her ""no"". She told me I was an ""idiot"", ""asshole"", ""gay"" and so on. I remember clearly that she said ""I will get you to have sex with me one day"", and I told her it wasn't funny and I was beginning to feel angry and unsafe. She simply walked away and I reported it to the teachers and showed them the letters/emails, just to be safe (as in not get her to come for me). The school took action, the girl was diagnosed with anxiety and mild depression. 

Glad I'm happy I reported that.

Or she would have come back for me.

EDIT:

I just hung out with Anthony all day at the lake and the chick was no where to be found."	t5_2t3t8	True

When I saw 'LetsNotMeet' I knew I had to share one of my own not-so-pleasant stories. 


It was Christmas Eve and I was a freshman in High School. My family has been split up for some time, so normally we trade off of Christmas Day and Christmas Eve every year, and this year I had come home early from my Grandparents Christmas party while everyone else was at my Aunt &amp; Uncles celebrating at another party. When I was dropped off my cousins offered to stay with me for a few hours, yet I declined. I thought I could watch some of my new DVD's and get some alone time in the house, which is a rarity.

 I had noticed an unfamiliar car parked on the street, but didn't think anything of it considering it was Christmas Eve. Probably a neighbors relative or something. After I got inside I locked the door, grabbed snacks, and started to settle down. I hadn't been home for more than 15 minutes when there was a knock at the door. I unlocked the door and opened it only a crack to see a man standing there. Dark Hair, Glasses, slightly overweight and dressed casually. He didn't LOOK like much of a threat, but my stomach dropped.
 He asked "" I was wondering about the car outside, is it for sale?"" I told him I didn't think so. ""Is there someone here I can talk to about it?"" I said (and quite stupidly I might add) ""no you can come back another time"" and shut the door and turned the lock as fast as I possibly could. He reached for the handle immediately and started pounding on the door. I heard a string of profanities and the pounding stopped. 
Terrified I was crawling on the floor to the phone hoping he wouldn't be able to see me threw one of the windows. Then I heard the noises. Our house had an open garage door, and it led through to the laundry room, where the door lock was broken and no one had bothered to fix it. Just then I heard a man yell,and I saw the man through the window run to his car and drive off. My uncle had gotten him just in time and scared the man off!!
Who knows what would have happened if he hadn't made it home in time. 
Sadly we didn't get the plate number, and nothing ever came of it, but I'll  never be home alone on a holiday again. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1357929861.0	16e44o	I'm afraid I'll meet my attacker again.	miranders	174	37	30	"Late this past September, I was coming home from work one night, around 1am. I've since left that job, but the hours were typically 2:30pm-11:30pm (sometimes midnight, if it was busy) and it was on the other side of the city, about an hour commute on the subway. I live in an area that doesn't have a whole lot going on after midnight, but there are a few bars on my way home and there are *always* people in and around the metro station until closing time. I never felt scared to walk home alone from the station, because there were always people around to witness any trouble, plus the comfort of the occasional police cruisers patrolling the area.

Until that one night...

I was approaching the corner less than ten feet away from the station doors, listening to my music as I always did on the long trip home, when I saw a small male figure coming towards me, *running* straight at me. I ripped out my headphones just as he came to a halt and shouted something right in my face — ""FUCK ME! GIVE ME YOUR NUMBER! COME HOME AND FUCK ME!"". I could smell the liquor on his breath and see the decaying of his teeth. He was short and skinny, almost frail, with a wild, bushy beard and even wilder eyes. He didn't pose much of a threat to me if it came down to a physical confrontation (provided he wasn't armed), but his expression was enough to tickle the panic button in the back of my mind.

I hardened up and replied ""No"" in the firmest voice I could muster and walked on past him. Inappropriate sexual remarks and wolf-whistles are pretty much a daily occurrence for me in this city, so I've gotten very used to dismissing those remarks without incident and going on about my day... but this guy was just so *angry*. He didn't like my answer. He ran around in front of me, blocking me from moving forward, and put his face close to mine once more, *screaming* things at me that I still shudder to repeat in my head. 

""Don't you know who I am?""
""I'll kill you, bitch!""
""I'll fucking slap you down to the sidewalk!""
""You'll be sorry you spoke to me that way, you're dead!""

Those are the words I remember most, but it was a blur of threats and profanities, peppered with drops of spit that flew at me, landing on my cheeks and in my mouth, which was hanging open in disbelief. A small streak of fire struck me and I started to feel angry and humiliated. I pushed past him once more and told him to fuck off, along with a few other choice words that I probably shouldn't have said given how angry he already was. I couldn't think straight. I could feel the eyes of the small crowd of people littered along the sidewalk, all stunned and no longer talking amongst themselves. Everyone was watching and no one was intervening. I looked at the cab parked a few feet away and gestured to him to help me out, pleading with my eyes for him to take me away from this situation. He just laughed and shook his head. Business as usual, I guess. I knew I was on my own to get out of this confrontation. 

He ran around me once more, furious this time, and started swinging his arms and grabbing at me. He grabbed at the sleeves of my jacket, grabbed at the strap of my purse, even tried to grope my breasts and behind. He was too drunk to hold on tightly to anything and I was putting up a good fight to rip myself away from his grasp, begging him to leave me alone. He wouldn't stop. I grabbed the collar of his shirt and flung him away as hard as I could, giving myself enough time to take off my high heels and ""arm"" myself. I was barefoot and backing slowly away from him, swinging a shoe at him whenever he got close and tried to grab me. I think I landed one blow, but I was so frightened at this point it was hard to think clearly. All I remember is yelling and swinging and trying not to stumble as I walked backwards... and the eyes of the spectators burning into my back.

He was carrying a plastic bag with something that looked boxy and electronic inside, like an external hard drive, but he didn't try to hit me with it... instead, he reached into his pocket and pulled out what I thought was an empty bottle (I never got a good look at it in the dark) and smashed it on the sidewalk. Holding a large shard of glass in his hand, he once again started running at me... I bolted. I ran around the corner and kept running , still barefoot, until my lungs were bursting. He didn't follow me. 

I stopped to catch my breath and put my shoes back on, trembling and gasping for air. I saw another figure down the road, this time much taller and cautiously approaching. His face came to light, and I vaguely recognized him as one of the people who had witnessed what just happened. Guilt was written all over his face, but he was trying to smile to make me feel at ease. He kept apologizing profusely for not stepping in, insisting that the guy appeared to be armed and that he wanted to call the police but his phone was dead. I was so shaken up, I couldn't even feel angry or blame anyone for not helping me, I just wanted someone to walk me home. He obliged, and insisted I call the police immediately.

It was stupid of me, but I hesitated to follow his advice at first. I kept hoping a cruiser would pass us, so I could flag them down and point them in the direction of the trouble; I was hoping they would catch the guy right away and I could just go home and hug my boyfriend and cry into his shoulder and never think about it again. Of course, police reports are never that simple. I didn't want to get into trouble, and although I have nothing to hide, the idea of bringing the cops into my apartment was still unsettling. What if they didn't believe me? What if they thought it wasn't a big deal and that I was wasting their time? What if they charged *me* with assault for hitting the guy with my shoe? I was in a completely irrational state of fear. 

I thanked the stranger for walking me home and ran inside and upstairs to my apartment, completely breaking down into tears as soon as I saw my boyfriend's face. It took me about five minutes to spit out what had happened, I was shaking and sobbing so hard. His first reaction was to run downstairs and ""catch that fucker"", but I explained that I had been jumped at the station, not outside our building, so he was probably long gone. He calmed down again and brought me to the bathroom to dry my tears and get into the hot bath he had already prepared for me before I arrived (he's the best!). I calmed down to a point where I was able to get my thoughts together and do what I needed to do — call the police.

Two officers arrived five minutes later and took my full report, as well as an official statement. They were both surprisingly kind and helpful, scolding me lightly for not calling sooner, but listening to every word I had to say and taking my story very seriously. While one was taking my statement, I heard the other on his radio, saying something like ""Yeah, he matches the description of the other report we got tonight... definitely the same guy"". Turns out that plastic bag I saw the attacker carrying was stolen property from someone else he had jumped right before he got to me. I couldn't believe it. What if I hadn't called the cops? How many other people would he have robbed or assaulted that night? What else would he have gotten away with?

Within an hour or two of leaving my place, one of the officers called me back and said they had caught the guy and were taking him to the station. He asked me if I would be willing to come pick him out of a lineup if necessary, and though it was past 3am at this point, I said I would do it. He never called me back to pick me up, so I'm guessing they had no doubt in their minds that he was the culprit. After all, he was in possession of the items that had been reported stolen by the other victim. 

In the weeks following the incident, my mind was *blown* by how compassionate and caring the police were. I received a number of calls letting me know the status of his case and offering me resources for victims of assault and robbery... I even received a call from a female officer who was just checking in on me to ask how I was doing and offer her personal support and guidance. I realize this is all probably standard procedure for them, but it made a world of difference for me, just knowing that I wasn't forgotten once they 'got the bad guy'.

He plead guilty to the charges, so I never had to get involved with his trial or testify... all that was asked of me was to provide a completely optional victim impact statement to be given to the judge during sentencing, which I was able to send by e-mail. I was contacted by the court and by a few case workers to let me know that he was in jail and would be released in February. He had been ordered by the court to stay away from me and any place I was known to frequent. His parole officer called me a few months later and said he was applying for early release and I did not object (though I was given the chance to do so, by sending another statement as to how my life had been affected negatively since the attack). 

For all I know, he's already been released, but now that February is approaching, I'm starting to feel nervous that I'll encounter him again. I am much more cautious about traveling at night now, but I can't always find someone to accompany me and I can't just rearrange my life out of fear. I've been doing a great job at staying strong and not feeling like a victim or wallowing in self-pity since this happened. I try to comfort myself with the fact that it was a random attack and that he has no idea who I am or where I live and work. I will likely never see this guy again, and I truly hope he learned his lesson and will not try to hurt or steal from anyone else in the future. I feel strangely guilty for messing up his life by getting him thrown in jail, but what else was I supposed to do? It was the right thing to do, to help take someone dangerous off the streets so no one else would have to go through what I did, or be mugged like the other guy was. 

Still, it's hard to shake the thought that he *does* know my name now, thanks to the court-appointed restraining order... what if he's unstable and wants revenge on me for putting him behind bars? What if he finds out where I live? It's hard for me to imagine him as anything but the drunk and crazed animal I met that night. I'm scared.

This all started in 11th grade, and continued for almost a year. I worked as a supervisor at a drug store, where we would regularly hire a bunch of new high school age employees at once, so I didn't have any issues when Jay started working there. He was my age, and seemed like a bit of a weird guy. Nearly everyone who worked there found him to be annoying as hell. He was also a serial liar, and would make up lots of obviously fabricated stories to get attention. I figured he didn't have very many friends, and I knew that he was home-schooled, so maybe it was just that he hadn't had as much of a chance as the rest of us to socialize with people his own age. So I left him alone about it. I usually just smiled and nodded even when I knew he was full of shit.

 
Anyway, Jay seemed to appreciate that I didn't immediately blow him off everytime he spoke to me, so he would seek me out during shifts to chat. Our phone numbers are posted in the employee office, so he eventually added my number and started to text me as well. He wasn't the best conversation, but he seemed harmless, and I also have an abnormally high level of patience, so I didn't see any reason to ask him to stop. One day he texted me, asking me out. I hadn't known him for that long, and to be honest I didn't find him attractive at all. His personality also wasn't great, so I gently told him no thanks. He persisted though, of course, but I REALLY didn't find anything about him to be appealing. I just kept rejecting his offers, even when he started to beg. I figured that this had gone too far, so I told him that he really had to stop asking me, and that I didn't want to talk to him anymore.


A few weeks go by, then he starts sending me distressed messages. He went on about how he was depressed, and how he hated his life, and how his parents and brothers were both physically and emotionally abusive to him. How his older brother molested Jay and his sister as kids. How his parents were kinky sex addicts. On and on. I kept telling him to get help from a professional or a distress center, and that I was not the person to be dealing with.

 
Then he started talking about taking his own life. This is when shit started to get real. He refused to confess these things to anyone but me. He would text me late at night, saying that he didn't want to wake up in the morning. I knew that this kid often lied to get attention, but this is something that I assumed he wouldn't joke around about. Besides, I wasn't about to accuse him of being a liar, because I didn't want to be the one responsible for pushing him over the edge. So I would stay up all night with him, begging and pleading with him to not do it. He started to get really morbid and describe different methods of suicide that he was contemplating. Multiple times he stopped responding to me for several hours, and I would panic and try calling his home phone. Once his mom answered, and I asked her if he was alright. She was really confused and told me that yeah, he was fine, and he was at some music class. I would flip my shit at him for scaring me, and he would flip his shit right back because I called his house number. Apparently he didn't want anyone to know about his depression, and if I dared to send the cops after him, he would just ""do it faster"". I started to get incredibly stressed out, feeling that all the pressure was on me to keep this kid alive. I had to constantly reassure him that I was there for him, while secretly resenting him for putting me through this. Looking back, I probably should have just called 911.
 

Then he started asking me out again, saying that I was the only reason he was alive. He started using his ""depession"" as leverage. This is when I started to clue in to what he was doing. I couldn't believe it. As if he would sink so low. So I gave him shit and started ignoring him.


Another few weeks passed. He texted me to tell me that he was going to his friend's cottage, and that there would likely be girls there, mentioning that this is my last chance to change my mind. I told him to go ahead and have fun.


The first day of his ""cottage visit"", he meets Jessie, and of course texts me about her right away. He won't shut up about her body and such, but I figure its cause he's just a weird horny boy. I'm already not believing this (if you saw this kid, it would be clear that he's not the type that girls would throw themselves at), and it gets weirder as he goes on about how she is ""so into him"" already, and how she took her top off when she was swimming with him that afternoon, then how at night she would beg for him. I told him fine, it's good that you finally have someone in your life.


It doesn't stop of course, with him rambling on and on about how he tied her up and rubbed her breasts and how she would bend and moan. Then he starts talking about doing her, and he started asking me for opinions on positions. This is what he would send me: ""so what would you prefer... bend and tie her over a table or chained spread-eagle on the bed? :p"". So naturally I told him to stop texting me kinky shit. Then, because I was pissed, I went on to tell him that I don't believe any of this, and that he needs to get a life. Anyway, so he sends me a picture of a GAGGED, TIED-UP brunette, lying on the fucking floor of the garage. To prove she is real or something, I dunno. After that, I stopped replying.


Another few weeks. His ""friend"" starts texting me (from the same number, claiming that Jay left his phone unlocked). He said that Jay was obsessed with me, and that he had to leave Jessie behind at the cottage. Then he started asking questions about what I thought of Jay, trying to get me to say something bad about him. In my mind, I called bullshit on this right away, but I still didn't reply.


Then, a few days later, he starts ""bumping into me"" at places where I didn't tell him I would be. A few times is coincidence, but I mean EVERY DAY. When he finally showed up at my driver's ed school (a place he had zero business being at, considering it was way across town from where we both lived, plus the fact he already had his license) I really started to freak out. He must have been following me, because not even my closest friends knew that I was taking that class! I would avoid his gaze as much as I could, and take off as soon as we were dismissed. The texts resumed, this time saying things like ""please let me tie you up, it would be fun"" or ""i can be gentle, let me tie you up and touch you"". The worst was ""if you dont let me then i will do it forcibly. i will find you and take you and tie you up so tight"". CREEPY SHIT. Then he randomly transfers my high school, chooses a locker only a couple away from mine (no idea how he knew which one was mine) and starts joining all the same clubs as me.


That was the final straw. I let loose on him, screaming that I knew he used his ""depression"" as leverage, that I knew Jessie was made up, that it was him texting me, not his friend, and that he is FUCKING WEIRD and needed to stay the hell away from me! He started making excuses for his actions, like ""oh i was drunk when i sent that"", but in the end he admitted I was right about everything. I told him if he tried to talk to me again besides at work about work-related things, I would call the cops. I guess he got the message because after that he left me alone.


A month later, I heard rumors that he was trying to pick up the new cashier girl, who was only about 14 or 15. She admitted to me that he was being really perverted, and talking about bondage and gags to her. Another (lesbian) friend at the store told me that he was creeping her out as well, and that he was going to force her and her girlfriend to have a threesome with him. 


I could handle him creeping on me by myself, but I wasn't about to let him torment a 14 year old or threaten my friend. So I got him fired (I had kept all our messages as evidence, and rightly so). And that's the last I heard from him, save for a few instances when he tried to reconcile, saying he was sorry. He still was asking for me to ""give him a chance"". At the time, I had blocked him on facebook, but he made a new account and tried to add me again recently (~3 years later).


Anyway, we were all lucky that we stopped him before he had the change to carry out any of his threats. And I'm quite proud of my 16-year-old self for handling it as well as I did. Being stalked was an experience I won't soon be able to forget. 

**TL;DR: Got pursued by a coworker, to the point where he started actively stalking me. Eventually got him fired.**

**Edit:** Added TL;DR. Also, the reason why I didn't turn him in to the police is that I was never really intimidated by him that much. I was more angry at him than I was scared by him. He was all talk, just a weird kid who was starving for attention. Last I heard he has a girlfriend now, so I guess he must have calmed down enough not to scare her away. Hopefully."	t5_2t3t8	True
1342491199.0	wog6r	Met a seemingly deranged man at an abandoned water refinery	vortex222222	158	25	49	"I've been reading this subreddit for awhile now, and figured I might as well contribute my own story.  Preemptive apology for the over-artsy shots, but these weren’t meant to be for documentation.

One of my favorite activities is exploring old, abandoned buildings.  I've seen quite a few strange things during these trips, but one experience still creeps me out to this day.

A few years ago, I found a long forgotten water refinery through the help of online exploration communities and google earth.  Although it's stupid, I always go to places for the first time alone, partly for the thrill and partly because if something bad were to happen, I would feel terrible having brought someone else into that situation. So, I make plans to head there the next day after my classes let out.

The day of the trip, I pack up my camera and water bottle, and set off following my hand drawn map (the downside of not having a printer).  After an hour or two of biking, [I finally arrive at the place,](http://i.imgur.com/eFxSy.jpg) which luckily had an old bike path dead ending just past it.  It was completely [overtaken by vegetation](http://i.imgur.com/RNaUW.jpg) with trees growing up, through, and around the buildings, not to mention that the actual buildings were [just disintegrating](http://i.imgur.com/FMvMX.jpg), with paint peeling off every wall and ceiling.

I took my time, scouring each of the buildings looking around for anything interesting.  [I found hundreds of broken windows](http://i.imgur.com/FMvMX.jpg), weird broken spheres, [and some kind of giant oven](http://i.imgur.com/ia3u5.jpg). After an hour or two of [successful exploring](http://i.imgur.com/SeBU7.jpg), I decided to head off happy with an SD card full of pictures. Soon after I pulled my bike back out through the hole in the fence I entered and started biking away, I remembered there was one last shot I wanted to get.  I'm pretty insistent on getting the shots I want, and I didn't know if I would ever come back, so I decided to just tough it out, ride back and take the picture.

As, I was going back, I saw a lone man dressed in old clothes [walking down the bike trail away from the dead end](http://i.imgur.com/4uynK.jpg). I thought it was kind of a strange path for someone to take a walk on, and something in me said, ""don't let him see you go in there.""  I biked past him, and gave him a slight head nod, and figured I'd bike all the way to the end of the trail, turn around, and by the time I got back, he'd be long gone, having continued in the opposite direction.  I leisurely take my time get to the end and turn around, and as I head back toward the hole in the fence, I see him there, staring at me, and walking back toward the dead end from which he came.  He had a happy look on his face, but it wasn't the kind of happiness that made me feel at ease in any way.  The best way I could describe it is he look like he had just been told a very dirty joke, and was trying to contain it.  I knew I had to do something as I was literally trapped between him and a dead end.

I decided to play it cool once more, but be ready to drop everything and run if things got hairy.  As I get closer and closer to him, I can see his facial expression clearer and it's not someone I want to be in the same state with, let alone the same bike path.  I'm silently cursing myself for going back for one picture, as I slowly get closer. Finally, I'm about twenty feet away from him, and he calls out, ""I sure would like a ride, it's so hot out. Mind if I jump on?""  As soon as I hear this, I realize this is no longer my brain falsely interpreting something as creepy.  I pick up speed and rush passed him putting as much space between us as I can.  I now long behind me and see that *he's once again turned around and following me.*  At this point I bolt, sprinting down the bike path, back onto the road.

Interestingly, I stop at a nearby gas station on the way home to get a refill on my Gatorade. I see a cop there and told him I just rode down the old bike path by this park.  He looked at me, sort of bewildered as to why a person would ride out there (or at least that was what I guessed from behind his sunglasses) and he told me he didn't recommend people going there, especially alone, as some shady characters like to hang out there.

I wish I could say I stayed away, but I went back one other time with a girl, and had a completely different but almost as creepy experience.  It's shorter and not worth a whole post, but I can add it on in the comments if anyone wants to hear it."	t5_2t3t8	True
1376408571.0	1ka7fe	7 AM bus ride creeper.	Becciusmaximus	169	34	39	" It was Mon, Dec 1 2008 (I was 15) when I got sexually assaulted by some random creeper on public transit in Calgary, Alberta. 


 Typically in December here is below freezing but it was during a Chinook so it was moderately warm for a December morning. I decided since it was so nice out that i'd wear my skirt and some awesome kneeish high boots to school. I ended up catching the bus at 7AM right on time.

 I walked to the middle of the bus and sat down. I did notice the man in the back corner two seats down from me talking. I looked back to him and he smiled at me, so I smiled back. He was at least in his mid 50's, He was East Indian and wore a baseball cap. He patted his seat and said ""Sit beside me"" I told him that I was quite alright where I was and apologized. I turned around and shuffled through my purse when he got up and sat beside me. He started with asking me how I was. I obliged only because I didn't really know what else to say. He then grabbed my knee and said ""You're a beautiful baby."" His other hand then grabbed my hand and he continued ""I love your mouth, your lips, your eyes, your mole. You are so pretty."" 

Now if these weren't any warnings for the upcoming events i'm not really sure what would be.

 I responded with thanks and just stared forward. He noticed that I wasn't looking at him and he sternly said ""Look at me."" I remember just staring at him for the rest of the bus ride. He continued with "" I have a fine arts major, and I take pictures of children and return them to the subjects as adults. They thank me so much when I do I get this feeling of joy from them."" I responded short and cold with ""Oh cool."" hoping that maybe he would shut up or just get it over with and leave me alone. Again, he continued ""If I could just get your phone number"" He pointed to my cellphone and showed me his hand of other people's numbers. ""I'll give you a call and we can set up a date and time and I'll bring my camera."" Quickly in my head I remembered a Criminal Minds episode and told him that this was my mother's phone and she's just lending it to me for now.

 He sighed and asked me ""Are you Married?"" I responded in short with ""No."" and he just continued "" You can love a monkey, You can love a dog, but you cant love a person?"" I nodded and looked out the window. 

Finally it was time to get off.

 Being that I was wearing a skirt and he had pinned me in the window seat, I rang the bell and said Excuse me. He didn't move. I looked at him and he motioned to step over him. Wanting to get the hell outa dodge, I stepped over him hoping to make it as quick as possible. As I was stepping over him, He reached up my skirt and grabbed my ass. I jumped over and stared at him and he just said the words ""Fine arts centre.""

 I didn't really get to process what happened until half way through my first period class at 9 AM. That was when I started to second guess my decisions. I ran out of class to my T.A and called the police and my parents.

 Now the police said they couldn't do anything. They actually got mad at me for not going to the bus driver (Its a pretty busy bus as it is) and for not coming to the police sooner. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1373683080.0	1i73ff	I think someone is trying to kill me - or am I overreacting? (xpost from r/indianapolis)	truthful_whitefoot	169	34	51	"I live on a corner intersection in a residential neighborhood in Indy, with a stop sign on the east-west road (the main road through the neighborhood) and no stop sign on the north-south road. People often run the stop sign on their way past my house, which pisses me off, especially since I have kids who play in the front yard. I mean, I don't get mad at the rolling-stop people, I do that myself, it's the ones who fly through at 30+ mph. 

Anyway, that's all set-up for the story. A couple of weeks ago, I was leaving my house for work, approaching the intersection from the north, when a late-model black chevy malibu/impala was approaching the intersection from the west, and it was apparent from his speed he wasn't planning to stop. I lost my head (and I've been angry with myself ever since for this) and I pulled out right in front of him; he almost had to go off the road to avoid me. As soon as I did it I felt awful, and almost stopped right there to apologize to the driver (young black guy), but I was afraid it would end up as a confrontation despite my evident contrition. So, I just drove to work. He followed me on the highway for a bit, but got off at an earlier exit than mine. 

Last week, I swear I saw the same car drive past my house while I was mowing the lawn, but who knows, that's a pretty common car. Then tonight while I was mowing the lawn again, I saw the same car (maybe) stop at the intersection from the west side, sit there for a minute, then turn north on to my street, stop right in front of my house, let a guy out of the back seat, then proceed north away from my house. The guy who got out (tall skinny black dude) started walking along the road south then east along my property. I freaked out, stopped mowing, and walked right into my house. He kept on walking past my house, and I lost sight of him. A minute or two later, the black car came back south on the road and turned east, and I lost sight of it too. A couple minutes after that, a dark green/gray big american sedan (caddy or lincoln, I think) driven by a black guy in a red shirt came through the intersection from the west and stopped in front of the house. When I looked through the window, I could see the driver talking to the guy who'd been dropped off. I'm not sure if I heard this right, but I think the driver asked ""he go inside?"" and then maybe into a cell phone ""where you at?"". He then picked up the walker, turned around, and drove off west. 

I left my house (I should note that due to a full garage, I always park in my driveway, so it's obvious when I'm home or not) and called the police (non-emergency line). They said they'd increase patrols in the area for the next few days, and to call 911 if I saw anything again. So now I'm sitting in my office, afraid to go home, knowing I can't stay here, completely freaked out. I do have a gun, which I guess I'll start carrying everywhere. 

tldr; a road-rage incident may have gotten me in trouble with some very bad people.

UPDATE: I called the police again when I got home, to make sure they were sending the extra patrols they promised; they said they were and would have the officer stop by to talk to me when he came. I told him the story as I had it written out above. The officer promised they would continue to run extra patrols through the neighborhood. I saw both the black chevy and the gray-green caddy (I think, or else very similar cars) driving through the neighborhood on Saturday; Sunday was quiet, with no sign of them. 

My wife was leaving our house today and called me to say that she saw a white Silverado with tinted windows and a special plate sitting in the street across from our house with the engine running, and he’d been sitting there for at least a few minutes. I called the police again, and they sent patrol car to our neighborhood. By the time I got to our house, right before the police arrived, the truck was gone. The officer (different guy from the one on Friday night) said he’d drive around and look for the truck in the area.

So, I don’t know what to make of all this. Either I’m paranoid and none of this has anything to do with me or the road rage incident, or else there’s a group of guys with the desire to hurt or kill me, and the ability to be patient, plan an attack, and coordinate several vehicles to use. I really hope I’m just paranoid, but my instinct is that I’m in serious trouble.

1366698296.0	1cx676	"""No seriously im the number 8"""	anja-	159	26	33	"There is a guy I went to high school with named John who was on the varsity football team. He was 18, but looked 30, and everyone was intimidated by him. I had a huge crush on one of his best friends named David for years. John's mom works at my dental office and she got him a job there after he dropped out of his 4 year university suddenly.

I have never been close with John, only spoke to him at a party or two. I graduated high school in 2010, and I get these messages from John over Facebook.

**06/01/2011**
&gt;John: hey anja-

&gt;Me: Hey John, what's up?

Conversation over. Then, I get these [text messages](http://imgur.com/qkwR2xx). I'm a little weirded out, but ignore it. The next day, I get this message on Facebook...

**06/02/11**
&gt;John: I just tolerated some bitch putting nipple clamps on me, but then she wanted to rape me, so I tried raping her, then she screamed and this guy that sounded like the guy from green mile came in and started lightly pounding me with fists. Then this faggot in a dress came in and thank god I didn't have to listen to him open his mouth. Then, then, they made me go make fun of these stupid college kids, then I talked to these ""cops"" they called in, then I got in a cab 280 dollars down. I'd be upset, but lol 280 dollars isn't much to pay for that much entertainment, i've been fucking bored as hell forever. What are you doing?

Again, conversation is over. I thought it was best not to answer. 

I get on Facebook and to ask David what's up with John. He panics and asks me what I'm talking about. I send him everything. Apparently he also threatened a good friend of theirs, Jane. Jane added me on Facebook and I told her my story. She got me in touch with local authorities because he had said much worse things to her. 

I met with detectives, took my statement, and told me that he was diagnosed with schizophrenia after being arrest for harassment. I agreed not to press charges because Jane's testimony was enough to get him the help he needed. 

He ended up going to jail and serving half of his time on parole with the promise that he would take his medication and go to counseling. 

I learned he was off parole (and not taking his meds) when dentist told my parents that he was working at his office. Awesome, great. I wasn't notified by the detectives of this. I was under their word that if his status every changed, they would notify me. No email, no call, no nothing. He got fired six months ago and I have been able to go back to my dentist. His mom still works the front desk. I have no idea where he lives or if he is medicated. I now carry pepper spray and am saving money for a handgun.

**TL;DR:** A high school acquaintance was diagnosed with schizophrenia after threatening me (rape) and another girl (kidnap, rape, kill) via social media and text messaging. He went to jail, got out, worked at my dental office, got fired, and now I have no clue where he is.

1366165057.0	1ci89t	Someone Under My Bed	rapeymcrape	160	26	37	"I just discovered this subreddit and realized it's time to talk about what happened to me 2 years ago. I created a throwaway account because I'm really not comfortable revealing my identity after writing about this. I'm a 25 year old female, I was 23 at the time this took place. I had been a college student but had to quit due to a major surgery in my leg so I was unemployed and had spent months just recovering. I was finally off crutches but still limping around. I lived (and still live) in an old Victorian two story house that is now a duplex. I live on the ground floor and a middle aged reclusive woman occupies the whole second floor (there are separate outside entrances). I lived with a male housemate that was also a friend that is a few years older than me and was employed as a security guard at a local casino. Our street is known for being seedy and not a good neighborhood but I've always felt pretty safe and never had much trouble.

One night I was home with my room mate and my boyfriend and we were watching movies in the living room that is at the front of the house. My room mate's girlfriend then came over drunk with another male friend of ours. The male friend sat down to watch movies with us and immediately passed out and my room mate and his girlfriend went to his bedroom at the back of the house and immediately started having the most insanely loud sex I've ever heard. She always sounded like the trashiest porn star or hooker I'd ever heard and the screaming could be heard from the street outside. 
A few minutes into their session my boyfriend and I were still watching movies, and heard a loud sound coming from the back of the house. We couldn't distinguish what it was, maybe something getting knocked over but we figured it was just my room mate and his girlfriend being extremely loud and all over the place.  Eventually they finished and the house was finally quiet again. Our movie ended and we decided to go to bed in my room. My room is in the middle of the house and shares a wall with my room mate's room and the living room on the other side. My bed was against the outside wall of my room parallel to an old window that slides up and down. The side and back of our house are pretty high off the ground, looking out the window it's a decent drop to the ground. Outside my window are vertical and horizontal beams that extend to hold up a little back porch/balcony for the lady upstairs. It really ruins the view having beams right there. 

My boyfriend went into my room and took off all of his clothes and jumped into my bed. I started to take off my clothes but stopped when I noticed the screen on my open window was missing. I had a cat at the time that was indoor only so my first thought was ""the screen is missing! Strega must have gotten out of the window!"" Then I noticed that the window was pushed up way more than I thought was possible. I kept thinking of my cat though, I was obsessed with keeping her inside. My first thought was to look under the bed and see if maybe she was under there. It was dark but I saw a black mass and reached out to grab her, thankful she was still inside. The black mass wasn't her. It was a black hoodie and someone was in it. I had grabbed someone's arm. 

For some reason my first thought at that moment was that a friend was playing a prank on me and it was probably someone I knew, so I kind of laughed and said ""Hey there's someone under here."" Then I lowered my face to meet the face of the person and realized I had never seen this guy's face before in my life. This was not a friend and not a joke. ""I don't know this guy!"" I said a little less calmly. My boyfriend was completely naked and told me to grab my gun as I was nearer to the closet than he was. ""Stay where you are!"" he screamed to the mass under the bed. The guy cooperated. I threw my boyfriend a robe and he put it on and jumped out of bed to near the closet where I was. He took the gun and pointed it at the bed and told the guy to come out slowly with his hands out. Since my room mate is a security guard I ran to wake him up for backup. He rushed into the room and the three of us stood there as a teenage boy wearing a black hoodie came out from under the bed. We were all kind of in shock, and started to question the kid, who cooperated with us completely. He was quiet and humble, and his eyes shook violently from side to side as if he was high on something. 

My room mate searched him. We emptied his pockets and he had condoms, lube, porn advertisements from the back of a dirty magazine (the kind where you can call a number and talk to a woman) and some dirty pills that he told us were Vicodin but they were really just extra strength ibuprofen. He also had a pair of my dirty underwear in his pocket. Dirty underwear that I had just had my period all over. That was the most disgusting part. We found ID on him as well, and a business card for a youth probation officer (so clearly he was a troublemaker). We also found a piece of paper with names and phone numbers on it that indicated he lived with his mother in a hotel room in a notorious drug motel that catered to prostitutes and meth. His high school ID was from Hoopa High, and he was clearly from the local Hoopa Native American tribe or at least part Hoopa Native.
When we saw he had no weapons we started questioning why he was in my bedroom under my bed with all this stuff, and asked him if he realized how serious this was. He quietly replied that he ""heard sex from the street and thought he could have some."" Basically he was a horny teenage boy on some sort of drug riding his bike around at night and my boyfriend's trashy girlfriend's sex noises were like a siren's song in the night to this kid. He was so overcome by his horniness that he scaled the scaffolding and beams near my open window and crawled in and under my bed probably to masturbate to what he was hearing in the next room. He probably jizzed on my underwear. 

Then he kept apologizing and saying he was sorry and knows it was stupid. I was still shocked and disgusted and wondering if he would have raped me if I had been alone, but we all felt a little compassion for the fucked up kid, his fate was basically in our hands at that point. We debated whether or not to call the police and finally decided not to (you can debate me on how wrong I am on that later.) We basically lectured him and told him how lucky he was that he crawled into my window and not someone else's because we could have shot him or called the police and had him arrested and whatever he was on probation for would be a lot worse. He kept thanking us and was super humble at that point. My room mate then escorted him out the front door and took his bike that he left on the lawn and walked him to his shitty motel and watched him go inside. We kept all of his stuff (he didn't have money, just the trash and IDs and phone numbers) and made sure to tell him we had his ID, knew where he lived, had his mom's number and his probation officer's number and that if we ever saw him on this street again he'd regret it. 
Our drunk friend and my room mate's girlfriend slept through this entire ordeal and we had to tell them the next morning what had happened while they slept. 

I know that I'm going to get a lot of shit from some of you for not calling the police, so I'm going to explain why we didn't. First of all, if I had been alone without my boyfriend there I definitely would have called the police after defending myself with my gun. That would have been a completely different situation. In this case I had my boyfriend in the room and a male room mate so we had the kid outnumbered. Secondly, as soon as I discovered the kid he cooperated and showed no signs of aggression or intent to harm. He did everything we told him to. Third, upon searching him even though he had condoms and lube which are creepy, he had no weapons. This indicated to us that he had no plans of rape or assault, he probably just really wanted the thrill of masturbating under my bed while listening to the sex in the next room. He wasn't a big guy either, he was a little skinny kid that I could have easily overpowered even with my small frame. 
From the info we found on this kid, he was a neglected horny teenage boy living with a druggie mom in a shitty motel, and yeah we felt sorry for him in the end. The fact that he is a Hoopa native also scared us a bit because people from Hoopa out here are known for violence and gang activity that made us realize that though we doubted this kid was violent, it's quite possible his family members are and either he would get the shit beat out of him by family or we would after getting him arrested. In the end I'm still terrified to keep my window open at all but I think we handled it well without having to get the police involved. After talking to the kid I really think he was thankful that we let him go with just a lecture. Having a gun pointed at him the whole time probably scared him enough to realize it was a serious offense he won't be repeating.

1363877009.0	1aqfjq	Some people need to start taking care of their own kids.	lamasgrande	174	37	34	"When I was twenty four, I decided to experience life abroad , so I joined a program to become an Au-Pair (fancy words for nanny) in the USA. This is my messed up story, it isn't creepy, just all messed up.



A family interviewed me, and decided to pick me as their in-home nanny for their 2 year old girl, and their 4 year old boy. The family lived in a pretty well off area in San Francisco, and the couple was still married and in their mid forties.



So three months after I was interviewed, I finally arrived, but they couldn’t pick me up, so they sent a driver to get me at the airport. I struck a conversation with the guy, since it was sort of a long drive and I was new to the city, and I wanted to know what there was to do, and such. 



Then we reached my future home to be for the entire year, and this lady tells me that there is one rule in her home, which she had NEVER mentioned to me the months before, and her rule was that “I was never to say no to the kids”; I finally met the kids, who were quite lovely, and the boy immediately liked me. 



I am a sporty person, so I decided to take Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Muay Thai as activities, 
since I used to train back in my hometown- this will be relevant later on. 



About a week into my moving, she gave me this talk about this book she was reading that said that kids want to control everything, and the only things kids could control were eating, pooping and changing their diapers. So if the kids didn’t want to eat/take a crap/change their diapers, I couldn’t push them to; their body was wise enough to tell them when the diaper was bothering them, when they were hungry, etc. I had never seen a kid crying like crazy when you asked them to change their diapers, but that’s what the two year old would do. And of course, I was forbidden to say no to them, and I had to also let them be in control, so they never ate when I was supposed to feed them, but when they felt like it, etc. 



She also told me that they didn’t believe in spanking, time outs or any kind of punishment, so what I was to do when the kids were beating the ever living crap of each other, was say “Stop”, grab the aggressor, and try to get them to be empathetic with the victim. So one day, the two year old really wanted my phone, and I hid it inside my pocket and bam!, she bitch slapped me across the face. Her mom saw her, and tried to have a talk with her, telling her that that hurted me, that I could cry, etc. Has anyone actually tried to reason with a 2 year old? She wasn’t being successful, so she eventually just took the kid away. 



Then there was this huge incident, where I took the kids to take a bath, and apparently the water didn’t go (which isn’t true), so she forbid me to ever take the kids for another bath, since she was afraid that I would leave the water there, and the two year old who loved baths, would try to go in and fall and drown. I explained to her that I would have never expected the water not to go, since I was quite sure I lifted that thingy that blocks the plumbing, and that we never went upstairs, and when we did, I made sure to close the bathroom and even the toilet’s lid. But she wouldn’t believe me, and somehow implied I left the water there on purpose to drown the kids. 



Then she told me she didn’t feel comfortable with the kids going in my room because there was a window near by, and she feared the kids would jump from the bed to the window and fall out two floors to their death. Which was quite hard, since they would have needed to climb to the bed, and then to a chair, and then the window. It just made no sense. 



She was crazy about organic stuff, every single item she had inside her fridge and the kitchen was organic, including the kids candies. I was allowed to have my own candies, and sweets as long as I kept them hiding from the kids. However, when I showed up with a coke, she wasn’t too happy. One time we took a trip to some organic ice cream place, and I got a chocolate ice cream, and as I was pouring it in my cup, she came right next to me and said “that has aspartame, don’t you know? That thing is really bad for your brain, if I were you, I wouldn’t eat it. Please don’t ever give that to my kids”. 



After that there were all these weird things she used to tell me, like one day I left some chicken that I no longer wanted to eat, so I just set it aside to have it later on. The next day she had a “talk” with me, telling me that food on plates absolutely grossed her out, that she didn’t even clean her husbands plates, so why should she do it for someone else?; to which I replied I had set it aside to eat it later. And her face fell to the ground and she said “you ate that? That was sitting out for a long time, and it has bacteria, you will get sick”. I mean, it’s San Francisco COLD! And the food wasn’t out for days, but just for a couple hours. 



She kept telling me things to try to scare me into staying home, things like “there are raccoons outside, so here’s a flashlight so you can scare them away, BUT there are also coyotes so you might not want to stay out until too late…” which sounded quite weird given that we were in the city. “That place of town, is super dangerous, there are plenty of thieves over there” – in another nice part of the city where another nanny lived. 



Anyways, one day she calls me and asks me to have a cup of coffee with her, which surprised me since we both lived in the same house, and it wasn’t like we were friends to just go for a coffee. So I came and she tells me that she feels that we’re not a good match, and that she thinks I should move to another family, that she had loads of negative feedback about me, and overall it had been such a horrible experience. And I was quite shocked and asked her what kind of feedback, but she wouldn’t tell me, because it was so much. She had already called the Au Pair agency representative, who turned out to be this extremely dumb lady, who explained to me that I had two weeks to find a new family or else, I had to go back to my home country. 
I had only been in San Francisco for 2 and a half weeks! 



In the meantime, my host mom was saying that she and her husband had booked a room in a hotel for me for three days, and that maybe I should go stay somewhere else. The agent is listening to all this, and she feels quite happy with herself after negotiating that I should stay for one week – with a family that wants me out asap – so I can make a bit more cash, and then I should ask friends to stay with them or something, because although she was supposed to make sure the nannys were fine, she couldn’t have me at her place, since she didn’t even have a mattress or a couch for me to stay, etc. 


My host mom then says that during the time I stay with them, she would control my cell phone to make sure I didn’t abuse it, and that she would be very very scared to have me around the kids. I was like what? I am a decent person, I am not a criminal or anything like that, why would the kids pay for the fact that you don’t like me? However, I told her that if she wanted me out, I was fine with that, that I cared to say good bye to the kids, but that was about it, I could be gone the next day. And she was like “honey, don’t get me wrong but they won’t even remember you”, and she got pretty offended that I wasn’t exactly upset about leaving her family. 


The next day I came out of my room and didn’t want to be near the kids that much, since she had this fear that I would kill them or something. So she told me that I could just go ahead and lock myself in my room the whole day if I wanted to. So I did, but a friend of mine texted me, she was going downtown and asked me if I wanted to come with so I could get a new phone so that new host families could reach me, since I was required to give up my phone at the end of that week.



So I left the home, and I started running late, so I sent her a message, telling her that I was going to be a bit later than I thought, but that I just didn’t feel comfortable around her, and that I felt like I was a threat to the kids, and overall that I felt bad about the situation. 



So what she did was immediately call the agency, and told them that I had threatened her and her family. The agency called me right away and told me that I was not supposed to go back to her home anymore, or she’d call the police on me. Also, I couldn’t go get my stuff without someone from the agency present, and it might be the case that the agent would actually have to do my suitcase for me, since I might not be allowed inside the home anymore.



She texted me and said I was not to come to her place at all, and she immediately cancelled the phone and the cards.



I was completely shocked, I told them that regardless of how good my English might be, it’s still my second language and it is expected that I make a few mistakes, that she was already treating me like I was a criminal and a monster, and I obviously didn’t like that. But they weren’t listening to me and said, look just stay somewhere until 8 pm when we can go get you, we’re too busy right now. 



So I was left completely confused, I hadn’t had any breakfast that day, I had no money on  me and it was only 1 pm. I sat on a bus stop and started crying. Luckily for me, my friend was on a bus and saw me and I went home with her. 



By 8 pm I was picked up by the same dumb agent who took me to a friends place. She now insisted I stayed with her, but I felt so disgusted by her not listening to me, and furthermore when the previous day she had insisted that I stayed with a family that didn’t like me, that I refused her help. 



The next day the agency sent me an email telling me that because I had seriously threatened my host family and refused the agents help, I was being kicked out of the program, that they were cancelling my visa right that moment and that I had to leave the country immediately.



And that’s how I ended up left in the streets of the US, with only 100 bucks on me, no visa – which is really bad in the US- and no ticket to go home. One of my newly made friends heard my story, and told her mom, who immediately took me to some lawyers, they kept asking me what I had done to them to make them so angry, and so upset and hate me so much, and I kept saying I hadn’t done anything. Which is still true. They tried to negotiate that they let me back in the program but they said they couldn’t. They reviewed the contract and whatnot but there was no way around it. 



I finally called them and told them that I would go to my own country’s embassy and complain that I had been smuggled into the US, that they were making me an illegal and putting me in danger, etc, so the least they could do was get me a flight; especially since I had just worked there for 3 weeks and there was no way I could have known they were going to kick me out like that, and I obviously had no savings (I had spent most of them paying to enroll in this program). They at least agreed on buying me a flight back home.



 This all happened in the span of three days, from the moment my host mom asked me to leave, to the moment when I actually left the country. I only stayed in the program for 3 weeks before I was expelled. 



A few days after I left, one of the girls I used to hang out with told me that the family had just received a new 18 year old nanny. They were trying hard to convince her of how dangerous the city was, and make her feel like she owed them something by buying her a laptop and allowing her to bring her friends home for a bbq. So my friend asked my former host mom why she had kicked me out like that, and the answer was simply because “she was going out too much, and I was afraid of the sports that she used to practice”. So basically she wanted me out for going out during my own free time rather than stay locked in my room, and because of martial arts. 



Months later, I spoke to the guy that picked me up when I arrived, and he told me that the family found out he had been talking with me that night, so they called his boss and had him punished for talking to me.



I always wonder if that lady will keep saying just how everything is out there to kill you, and if her kids will grow up and get sick of that, and not listen to her. Will she then try to reason with a teenager? Which is just as hard as reasoning with a two year old. I feel bad for those kids, because life doesn’t say yes all the time.




She was 44 years old, was very successful and worked from home, her husband was making loads of money. If she wanted her kids to grow up with such a peculiar education, where they’re never told no, she should have raised them herself, and not bring people from other cultures to try to do so. All that these kids really really wanted was their mommy…

1358915518.0	173rqj	Since we're on the topic of creeper cops...	puppy_time	161	28	18	"Female, and at the time I was 25.  I lived in a small Texas town, near the border.  I woke up very early one morning to make the 2.5 hr drive to the nearest big city to catch a flight out to visit my parents for Christmas. It was about 2:30 AM and I was inbetween my town and the nearest other town, so completely in the middle of nowhere.  For some reason, I thought that the nighttime speed limit was 60 (actually 65) and I was going 65 thinking I was 5 over the speed limit.  I didn't notice it was actually 65 until after this incident.  

I bring this up because I obviously wasn't speeding but was soon pulled over.  The guy gets out of the car, wasn't in uniform, didn't show me a badge and told me that I was pulled over for speeding.  He takes my license and registration and walks back to his car.  He stayed there for a good 15 minutes before returning to my car.

""Do you have any tattoos?"" He asks.
""Yes I have three"" I said skeptically.
""What are they?""  I told him I had three and gave a simple description. He eyes me for a second. I ask him why he's asking and he says ""You have a warrant out for your arrest.""  I said, ""FOR WHAT?"" 
""For Driving while Intoxicated (??)""  I ask him where this warrant is coming from.  
He, stutters a bit while saying ""From your State"".  (WTF you don't remember what state that is?)  I say ""MN? (where my liscense is issued)"" He says ""Uh yeah"" Then he walks back to his car.
This totally creeped me out, so I called my boyfriend and told him the story. He said he would call the local police station nearest to where I was to verify who this guy is.  While the cop is in his car, about 20 minutes pass, then I see him get on his radio and have a conversation.  He immediately walks back to my car and says ""Tell you boyfriend I'm a real cop"".  He can tell I'm upset at this point and asks me why.  I tell him because I might miss my flight due to this delay.  I also tell him that I've never even been pulled over for a DUI and would never drive while intoxicated.  He returns to his car for another 20 minute break.  Finally he returns to my car, hands me back my information, and tells me that he'll let me off this time, but if I get pulled over to expect getting arrested for the warrant.

So I did miss my flight.  While at my parents', I called my local sherriff's office, local police, state police and state warrant's office.  Nobody had ANY RECORD of any discretion of mine at all.  Later, I talked to that local police station that he was supposedly from.  He was a cop there, and when I tried filing a complaint they gave me the complete run around."	t5_2t3t8	True
1357521203.0	163atq	Butterfly Tattoo	iliveinatent	161	26	19	"I went to college in France when I turned 18. It was my first time ever living away from home, first time to get on a plane and first time to live alone in another country. 

 I rented a room in a house where there was one other International student, and we hit it off instantly, mainly because we spoke the same language. I sort of had a crush on him and we would make out sometimes after a few drinks.

He was friends with an older man, also a student (all the International students went to the same college since we lived in a very small city), in his 40's. I was a little wary of him because whenever we all hung out he'd sit quietly and just stare at me, and when I would look at him he would just grin. I didn't pay too much attention to him though because I was silly infatuated with my crush.

One morning all three of us went out for breakfast then came back home to hang out. (The older gentleman didn't live with us but he was ALWAYS hanging out with my guy.) We made plans to go out later at night and I decided to take a nap. I usually lock the door to my room but didn't that day for some reason.

I wake up from my nap with the old guy sitting on my bed and drawing with his finger on the exposed part of my chest. My face turned into a WTF!! expression and before I could speak he said, ""A tattoo would look great here. Maybe a butterfly?""

I got up all flustered but I didn't say anything. I didn't make a big deal out of it but I asked him to leave the room so I could get changed to go out.

A few weeks later there was a huge parade happening in the town we were in, so my crush told me he'd meet me after he was done with casses so we could watch the parade. He asked me to meet him at a certain street corner at a certain time. 

When I got there, the creepy old guy was waiting. Nothing weird there, I expected him to come along. So we wait for a bit and he keeps asking me to go over to his apartment which wasn't too far away because he needed to get something or whatever. I was getting nervous and told him that I promised my crush I'd wait for him, and that we can all go together once he arrives. He kept pressuring me to go with him and I found that a little strange that he was ditching his friend so easily. A few minutes later his phone rings. He hangs up and tells me that my crush can't make it, that he will join us way later. He says just come over to my place, I'll pick something up real quick and we'll leave. Don't be scared.

I was scared, but I went. I just thought if I act normal, then things will be normal. It's a very stupid way of thinking, but I was really naive and stupid. We take the tram and  reach his 'house', which is just, basically, a shed at the back of someone else's house which I suppose he was renting. I sit on the bed (the only place available to sit) and put my bag in between us for buffer space. He pulls out his laptop and is doing god knows what, and he keeps asking me to not be so scared and to remove the bag from between us. 

I try to laugh it off and pretend all is cool and I keep talking about random things thinking if I act normal he won't do anything fishy. He pulls the old 'you smell really good! Come closer I wanna smell you' routine. He rubs his nose on my neck and I freak out and stand up and I tell him that we should leave and go back to the city to watch the parade.

He kinda begrudgingly gets up and we leave. On our way back he is visibly upset and pissed off. On the tram back he starts whispering to me that since I'm a whore who fucks around with his friend, why wouldn't I do the same with him? 

I was terrified and was still on the thought that if I was nice to him he will feel bad and be nice to me. I told him that I wasn't fucking around with anyone, I just made out with his friend a few times and that it wasn't going to happen again. 

He started badgering me to go back and spend the night at his place. I told him no. We got off the tram. He asked me again to spend the night with him. At this point I just had enough of that shit. I told him, no! Just take me back home. (I had no idea how to get back home from where we were)

He said that he wouldn't tell me how to get home so I told him that it's fine, I'll find my own way. What followed was probably the strangest scene in my life. I spent over an hour walking around the streets trying to find a familiar street that will lead me home. I was crying the whole time. He was walking two steps behind me the whole time, saying things like 'haha you're going the wrong way' or 'just come home with me and I swear I'll take you back tomorrow' as well as 'this is what happens to whores who sleep around.'

When I finally hit a familiar street my heart skipped a beat. I couldn't believe I made it. I turned around and told him, I told you I'd make it and I just ran home.

After that I told my crush what a creep his friend was and he stopped talking to me. Such a douchebag. A few days later he got drunk and wanted to come make out, and I told him to piss off. Eventually I moved out, but I still saw those two around town. 

Sorry this is quite long. Once I made friends and grew into my skin I learned some common sense. A friend of mine also told me that the creep was married with kids and had a reputation for being creepy, even guys refused to hang out with him. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1346358545.0	z3h5z	Gravitron carny creep	youhatemeandihateyou	153	21	17	"When I was in 10th grade, my high school jazz band played 2 sets on the stage at the local fair.  We had about half an hour between the sets, so a few of my friends and I decided to go for a ride on the Gravitron, that centrifugal force ride that spins you so fast that you are stuck against the wall.  

At the last minute, my friends chickened out and I was left to hop on alone.  The 30-something, typical, mullet-clad ride operator looked me up and down as I climbed on, and I was not pleased to see that I was the only person inside the fully-enclosed ride.  Just as Mr. Carny was closing the door, an older man and his grandson hopped on, much to my relief.  The ride operator was clearly annoyed, but apparently undeterred in his quest for underage poontang.  He sat down in the control seat in the middle of the room, turned off the song that was playing, and started blasting ""Feel Like Making Love"" by Bad Company as the Gravitron began to spin.  Faster and faster it spun, and he waggled his tongue lewdly at me while I was pinned to the wall like a helpless insect.  As the ride stopped, I rushed toward the door at the opposite side of the chamber.  The door opened automatically when the ride stopped moving, and the man and his grandson were right next to the door and exited within seconds.  The carny rushed between me and the door and started to push it closed before I could escape while trying to push me against the padded wall.  I kneed him in the balls as hard as I could and slid under the half-open door.  

I ran back to the stage, and the ensemble had to perform 2 songs without the lead alto sax because I was shaking and crying off to the side.  I pulled it together, picked up my horn, and jumped in on the third song.  When I looked up from my sheet music, I saw Mr. Creepy Carny standing in the back of the crowd, glaring at me with his arms crossed.  He paced angrily back and forth while he waited for the set to end.  As the last notes of the last song faded out, I ducked back to the guys in the trombone section and hurriedly explained what had happened.  They immediately surrounded me and walked me away from the stage and back to the bus.  The carny followed the group, ducking between game trailers and rides, but couldn't get close to me.

This wasn't the only creepy experience I have had with carnies, but it was definitely the closest call.  Ladies, be careful getting on rides alone, especially if they are completely enclosed and you could be trapped with a carny who Feels Like Making Love.  Every time I hear that song, I remember the sinking feeling in my stomach that day on the Gravitron.

1374611261.0	1iwp7c	Creepiest deliveryman ever	shinyfriend	162	30	13	"At my first job, 14 years ago, I was a receptionist for a building. I sat in a large lobby all by myself. I tried to be friendly to everyone (as befits a receptionist, I guess), especially the delivery people. I struck up conversations with them, asked how their days were, offered them water... one of them even named his newborn daughter after me, because he liked my name.

One delivery guy would stop to talk to me, and started gradually complimenting me -- telling me I was pretty, that I had beautiful eyes, etc. He would hint that we should hang out, but I politely rebuffed him (he was twice my age). He was one of those intense people who looks you right in the eye and won't ""let go"", so to speak.  

He was from a payroll company, so he came by every two weeks. It got to the point where, if I was on the phone, he would stand by my desk and wait for me. He started saying things about how he could see in my eyes that I was a loving person, and he felt that he and I belonged together. He would proclaim how deep his feelings were for me -- all based on seeing me for about three minutes every two weeks.

One time, I was chatting with a guy who worked in the building, and I saw the guy coming toward the doors. I asked him to stay, and he did, and it was super awkward because the delivery guy stood by my desk and waited, like the other guy was going to leave and then we'd be alone. Finally, he gave up and left.

The next time he came, I was alone. And he was furious with me. He accused me of trying to avoid him, and told me I didn't understand that we were meant to be together, and how badly he needed to talk to me, and how strongly he felt.

At that point I told my boss, who reported it to his company, and I guess they either fired him or switched his route, because there was a new delivery guy two weeks later.

But I kept waiting for him to come back. He knew I spent most of the day alone. 

When I left for a new job, I recommended that they replace me with a guy. Because ugh. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1371256855.0	1gdha5	Creepy vibes turn out to be true in a horrible way	lavenderlotus	172	41	54	"Love this sub &amp; excited I finally get to post, however I wish it was under less creepy circumstances.

Background: I'm a 30 year old female. I live in a nice part of a pretty crappy city where all the crime is drug-related. My creepy story started a week ago &amp; continues currently.

A family member of mine, Zoe, recently had a death on the other side of her family. I didn't attend the funeral but I did attend the reception with my boyfriend, Russell.  Zoe has a boyfriend, John, with whom she has been with for aproximately a year &amp; a half. 

I had met John only a couple of times before. Nice enough guy. I knew he had done some prison time (a pretty solid sentence actually but I never knew why until yesterday) but I've never been one to hold judgement over something like that, having a brother in prison, as well as several friends on parole. I, myself, have no criminal record but I am well aware that the people I do associate with have paid their debt &amp; are moving on as actual productive members of society. I should add that I am an addict in recovery as my friends. Ok, I digress. 

So back to the reception. Russell &amp; I paid our condolences to Zoe who directs us to the kitchen/eating area where there is a sizeable spread of delicious yummy goodness. Russell is taking our food to a table in the eating area while I go to the kitchen to get some cups for some tasty beverages. John &amp; some random guy who has indulged a bit in tasty beverage are in the kitchen so I give John a hug &amp; tell him I'm sorry for what they are going through.

John says, ""Damn girl, you smell good!"", which I think is highly strange for several reasons, largely being that we are at a funeral reception for his girlfriend's (MY family member) father. Not wanting to be rude &amp; giving him the benefit of the doubt, I reply, ""Oh, thanks"" with a nervous giggle. He then says, ""**NO, I mean real good"" in an almost menacing (maybe sinister is the word I'm looking for?) manner. Bells, whistles, alarms, red flags, no more benefit of the doubt. At that moment I thought, ""I need to nope the fuck out of here"".

He continues the conversation with full-blown creepy-eyes. At this point, it's just myself &amp; John in the kitchen. He asks if I am still clean to which I say yes. I've backed away from his lingering, creepy too-far-down-my-waist-nearing-my-ass-grabbing hug, telling him I need to get back out to my boyfriend. Before I leave the kitchen he says, ""Hey, if you ever need anybody to talk to, I'm always here"". Nice sentiment, dude.

I rejoin my boyfriend &amp; the rest of the day was uneventful. I couldn't shake the strangeness of my encounter with John though. It was just weird to me. 

Fast-forward to yesterday. I had heard of a shooting at some apartments, which wasn't a shock &amp; completely unrelated to this story with the exception of this. I, being a newsie, was searching for the news story on the interwebz when I saw a link to another local news story with a picture of John next to it. I blinked my eyes a few times to clear them, thinking they were playing tricks on me. It was, in fact John.  I clicked on the link to find out he is on the run &amp; wanted for **FORCIBLE RAPE IN THE 1ST DEGREE of a 14 year old girl &amp; that he was in prison for several things including reckless endangerment &amp; ATTEMPTED MURDER**. The US Marshall's are searching for him. 

Holy what the actual fuck.

TL;DR: Family member's boyfriend turns out to be a super-creep on the run from the fuzz.

EDIT: Added TL;DR

Update: Added link to story in comments.

EDIT: My encounter with Zoe's boyfriend happened **BEFORE** the rape &amp; **BEFORE** I read the news story &amp; **BEFORE** he went on the lam (which means on the run, buut lam sounds cooler).

Also, the police are still looking for him. IF I have another encounter, I will damn sure call the police &amp; report it; I'm not a stupid woman.

1368566867.0	1eca0u	Secondary school version of 'Single White Female'	thenightbattles	163	30	19	"Thankfully, this story does not involve sexual assault but it got very disturbing over a a period of 3 months. Oh, and I'm female.

When I was 16 and in secondary school, I was really into the whole 'goth' thing and I took great pride in having a very unique appearance. At lunch, my friends and I all ate together because we were all 'freaks' and at the beginning of the year, a new girl joined us and I'm writing her name as 'May'. May was a grade behind me, but said she was really into goth music and simply LOVED the clothing and really wanted to hang out with us. I thought 'the more the merrier' and said it would be a great idea and I was always friendly with her. She seemed very nice, but very awkward and didn't have the best social skills.

That same day, when I got home from school, I opened MSN Messenger and there was a contact request from May. I accepted and we chatted, she asked a lot of questions about me, like where did I get my clothes? What bands did I like? What makeup did I use? Over time, I began to notice that May was always VERY interested in what I wore and liked. People began noticing her copying my clothing, hairstyles and makeup. I thought it was flattering, for once, someone thought I looked cool!

Then things got a little weird. I used to make bracelets for friends and I always wore a lot as well. May asked for a bracelet one day and I made her one and she was overjoyed. After school, some friends approached me and explained that May had cornered some friends and demanded they hand over their bracelets because ""Thenightbattles is MY best friend"". She began lying to me, telling me that my friends were saying horrible things about me, that they weren't to be trusted and that she was the safest person to be around. I ignored this, but I began having these 'gut feelings' that something was a little off about May.

Unfortunately, 16 year olds are not always known for their brilliance. I was in a Physical Education class and when I went to change out of my uniform and into my clothing, my clothing was gone. I was very upset and had to spend the day in my gym uniform and a few days later, May came to school wearing my outfit. I demanded it back and she apologized and said that she had ""found it"". She changed into her own clothing and gave me back mine. Then she began pleading to borrow my clothing, and if I leant her a jacket, she would tell people that it was mine and we were 'so close' that I leant it to her. She had cut her hair at this point and dyed it the same colour as mine, she also began copying the makeup I wore and would try and dress the same as me, like 'twins'.

I had been dating a boy at the time, and as most teen romances, it fizzled out. A few days later, May began seeing the boy and that gut feeling got a little stronger but I brushed it off, saying it was me being jealous. Then she began calling my house. She would call after school, and in the evening and if she was unable to reach me, she would call back again and again until I was on the line. I had to tell her to stop calling my home because it was tying the line up and my family was quite pissed. After that, she began walking home with me, even though we didn't live anywhere near each other. As for the internet, she was always online and would normally email me 2-5 times a day, usually those little surveys where you read about the sender and then fill in the questions and send it back.

She also began to get very clingy, at lunch, I had to sit beside her. If someone else was sitting beside me, she would either beg them to move, or simply force them and then play it off like a joke. As a joke, a friend refused to move once and said he wanted to stay where he was. She burst into tears and ran away. I felt bad and followed her to the girl's toilets and she was crying and saying that I was her best friend and how dare someone else take her spot?

In October, she said she joined the yearbook group and she was the photographer. She said she had to take pictures for a fashion page and asked to take some pictures of me. I didn't question it because the same thing happened last year and I modelled a few outfits. But she was taking pictures of me every day and didn't seem to want to take photos of any of my other friends. Well, turns out she wasn't on the yearbook team and all those pictures of me? She pasted them in her locker.

I honestly didn't know what to do at this point, I was really weirded out, my friends were weirded out and in November, she stopped coming to school. To be honest, I didn't question anything, I was so happy to be 'free'. I blocked her email address and tried to forget about her. 

The rumour spread through school that her parents had become worried about her behaviour and had her transferred to a different high school.

The rest of the year was uneventful until the summer. School was out and I had gone to a local punk show with friends. While we were waiting in line, a kid my age came up to me and asked if I was 'Thenightbattles'. I said yes and what he told me was in a highschool in a nearby town. May had been transferred there and had told the 'punk/goth' kids there EVERYTHING about me. My appearance, what I liked and disliked and that we were the very best of friends, had been best friends since we were little kids and we did everything together. In the summer, she got a yearbook from my secondary school and would carry it around and show people at local band shows my picture and tell them about our best friend adventures. This went on for most of the summer and each time, it gave me the shivers. 

By the time I turned 17, it had pretty much stopped and I never heard from her, or anything about her. When I signed up for Facebook, I made sure to alter my name just in case she pops up again."	t5_2t3t8	True
1364537931.0	1b89ft	This woman has been harassing me for nearly two years... my extreme patience has finally worn out.  Please, help!  I don't know what to do.	ihastenbucketsnukkuh	165	32	69	"I met this woman on Okcupid about two years ago.  After seeing her for about a month, I called it quits.  She was pretty rude, she would insult me, things like that.  

For a while after that, things are okay.  Then she contacts me and wants to grab a drink, and explains that why she was acting the way she was (bad relationship in the past, money issues, etc.).  So, I give her the benefit of the doubt and decide to meet her for drinks, thinking maybe we could be friends.  

She brings up maybe seeing me again, and I said no, but that we could still be friends.  She flies off the handle (or, her bar stool), yells at me, and leaves me stranded completely across town, with both of our tabs.  The bartender is pretty concerned, and he allows me to only pay mine.  

Again, things were fine.  After a couple of months (this is probably late fall/ early winter) she contacts me AGAIN.  I was busy with homework, but she wouldn't leave me alone so I let her come over.  I just sit there and do my homework, hoping that me ignoring her would get the message across.  NOPE. I finally ask her to leave, and she leaves after quite the fuss.

I don't hear another word from her until the next summer.  She calls me up because her dog is missing, and since this place is a ghost-town in the summer, she has nobody else to turn to (so she said).  I go help find her dog, she says she's sorry and backpedals AGAIN.  I tell her that there will never be anything between us, and tell her why, and how many chances she's had, and just to leave me alone.  She thanks me, and I don't hear from her until this last Christmas.

I'm at my mom's house in my hometown, browsing the internet on Christmas Eve, when I get a message on okcupid.  Basically, she had been doing google searches on one of my internet handles, and she found a porn site where somebody had registered with a name similar to one that I use.  Her exact words:  ""You'd rather whack off to 40 year olds than have sex with me?  Weak,""  followed by cusses, insults, and the like.  I tell her never to contact me again, and block her.  

A month ago, I'm chilling in Dunkin Donuts, eating breakfast before class, when she magically appears at the table next to me.  She acts like nothing's wrong, tries to engage in small talk, stuff like that.  I act cordial back, because I don't want to be rude, but I scarf my breakfast and book it out of there.  For some context, this isn't the first time this has happened.  She will sometimes show up out of the blue when I'm out at the bars, or even when I'm walking between classes.  

Two weeks ago, I start getting google chat messages from her.  The most recent ones are attached.

[Gchat messages](http://imgur.com/a/vs7Sz)

How in the world do I get her to leave me alone?  I have a lot of patience with this, but now everytime I hear the noise my phone makes when I get a Gchat I get extremely frustrated.  I graduate soon, so my classload is extremely heavy, and this is definitely not helping.

I don't want to involve DPS or the police, so are there any other options?  Ignoring her and/or blocking her doesn't work- she just creates a new handle and messages me from that.

Please, help!  
Thanks

1361643427.0	19375n	Japanese Subway Creep	i-killed-mufasa	167	37	20	"This happened when I was 18 and had just moved to Tokyo for college, and was living at a dorm that was unfortunately about an hour away from my school and the center of Tokyo. Now, Japan is one of the safest countries in the world. People leave their bikes unlocked for hours on the street in the middle of the city, and nobody will lay a hand on them. The only real crime problem they have is pervs on the subway with wandering hands, but since I'm very obviously American and won't put up with that bullshit I guess no guy has ever been brave enough to try anything on me.

That was until one night when I ended up going out to dinner with a friend and had to take a late train back to my dorm. If you've ever been on the Japanese subway you'll know how crowded the Express trains can get at night and early in the morning, they literally have men standing outside of the train who push passengers in like a bunch of sardines. Well I was pretty tired and not in the mood to stand for an hour between a bunch of sweaty drunk businessmen, so I opted to take the Local train back to my dorm, even though it would take about 15 minutes longer than Express. 

So I'm sitting on the train and nothing is out of the ordinary. As the train goes along more and more people start getting off the train until it's only me and one other man in our car. He's just your typical middle aged Japanese businessman, a little on the greasy side. After a few stops no one else gets on and the man doesn't get off, but I can feel him watching me from the other side of the car. I'm not too worried, I get a lot of stares being a young American girl in the middle of Tokyo but then the guy starts inching his way across the car closer to where I'm sitting. Still I think, no big deal, maybe he's trying to get closer to a map on the wall. I can still feel his eyes on me and just to be safe I move to the other end of the car, it's more comfortable in the ""Reserved"" seats anyway. 

Then it gets weird. The guy gets up and moves to the exact seat I had just been sitting in. I was kind of grossed out, what was he trying to do? Feel my ""warmth"" from having just been sitting there? Now I was kind of getting uneasy. Luckily, the train stops at it's next stop and the guy gets off the train. I was relieved, until he comes back on the train through the door right in front of me and sits directly next to me, looking straight at me and open-mouth breathing on me. I didn't make eye contact and just kind of sat frozen for a few seconds until I realized what was going on. I looked at him like ""Oh don't even try anything on me"" and stood to get up. Luckily someone else got on the train at the same time and he literally bolted off the train before the doors shut and we left.

I don't know what he was planning on doing that he'd risk missing his stop over, but thank God someone else got on the train when they did. Needless to say I put up with standing for an hour and take the Express train now."	t5_2t3t8	True
1358721689.0	16yb8e	"""You were just asking for it, baby."""	askedforit	172	42	57	"This'll be long, sorry. Gotta get it off my chest. Parts will be NSFW. Rape warning.

Highschool was a rough time for me, I guess. I was constantly living in the shadow of my bustier, blonder, bubblier best friend- So I did what any sane teenage girl would do: I took lots of nudes. I got all the attention I wanted (and more that I didn't want) so all was well. 

I never thought they'd get into the wrong hands, I guess. And I hadn't connected the dots when I started getting texts from an unknown number.

&gt;nice ass, want something else to sit on?

I wasn't the most conservative dresser, anyone who had a myspace could get my number. I asked who the sender was, but never got an answer. It was flattery, if you can believe it, so I ignored it. I'd get one or two of these messages a month, but I'd grown accustomed to deleting them as soon as I got them.

I was broke, so the only viable option for beng transported to and from school was the bus. Our ""chauffeur"" was Coach Johnson, a man in his late 60's who had a tendency to turn his hearing aid off as soon as the school bell rang. This meant that the bus was a free-for-all. I was in the very [last seat](http://www.lasvegasbussales.com/products/photos/359362720835_school-bus-seats-b36379.JPG), back to the window, feet to the aisle. A girlfriend of mine was in front of me, we were talking and gossiping when my phone started blowing up. I had my ringtone set as some stupid, chimey *ding-dong!* I flipped it open and could see my inbox quickly expanding as the *ding-dong!*s continued. It was one message, sent over and over, from the same unknown number.

&gt;You look great today, babe.

No one called me 'babe'. I was single. People in the seats near me were starting to give me glares as the *ding*ing and *dong*ing *ding*ed and *dong*ed on. Every time I would try to change the volume, a notification would pop up and forbid me from doing so. I wrapped it with my jacket and stuffed the phone into my bag, and after 45 seconds or so, the muffled alerts stopped.

I was on the verge of tears, a combination of embarrassment and being flustered with the technology and the stupid prank, and not knowing who was behind it. Thats when I heard the laughing. It was a guy I sorta knew, Alex. A grade above me, and clearly enjoying the prank. When he knew I had seen him, he stopped, apologized, and came to sit by me. We chatted, he told me he didn't know someone was being rude and tried to calm me down. What a guy, right? I asked him for his number. He told me he didn't have a phone. Fair enough.

We became friends, and things got a little flirty. We had the back seat to ourselves, where we could giggle and talk and be teenagers. It was rarely intimate, more playful. He liked to play-fight. Hold my wrists together and tickle me so I had no choice but to squirm and 'fight' it. He'd take my folder of homework, a lunch, my wallet, or my phone and hold it just out of reach. Now that I look back on it, it was his shitty way of showing me that he was in control.

Not one to be outdone, I would try to take something of his. He traveled light, though, and didn't have much to 'steal'. There was a pencil case he kept in his bag, and that was my target. After a few futile attempts, I managed to snag it, and stuff it in my bag to see how long it would remain before he noticed it. My stop approached, and I exited the bus with his belongings still in my bag. Once I was in the privacy of my own home, I snooped. Opened the pencil case. The contents were pretty average. A few dollars, highlighters, pens, pencils, condoms, an ID, and a phone. What was he-without-a-phone doing with this little jewel? 

I powered it on, not sure what to expect. It was just a phone. Displayed the time, made calls, the works. Though, something was off- the contacts were numbers, around 10 or 11. I first went to the media, so see if this really was Alex's. Awkward selfies, you know? But I was greeted with a lot more flesh. Some of it seemed professional- good lighting, nice backdrops. But the majority seemed amateur. With teenage freckles and tan lines and childish underwear and my shower curtain.. 

Yep. I was all over this guy's phone. Not just my ass, but also my face. Some were directly from myspace, some seemed to be taken from a distance. How the fuck he managed some of these, I still don't know. But what really bothered me were the indecent pictures I hadn't bothered to share with anyone. My only guess is that he sent them to himself while I was distracted. I felt invaded.   Sick. I had no problem sharing, but he could've asked permission, right? 

The next day I avoided him on the bus, but he was persistent. After some prodding, I gave in. I took the phone out of my bag and practically threw it at him. At first he was confused.

But then, he fucking *smiled*.

""What the fuck are you doing with those?"" I was livid.

""You were just asking for it, baby."" He had turned around in the seat and had his hands planted on either side of my head. He leaned in and tried to kiss me.

I don't know why I didn't resist more. I know I tried to say 'No', but I don't think it even came out. We were kissing now, I guess. It was pretty one-sided. I wasn't moving much. He took my wrists in one hand and started feeling me up. I remember getting a 'Stop' out, but that wasn't enough. I turned my head to the side, trying to look down into the aisle. I could only see two littler girls up in the front, paying no attention. Coach Johnson wasn't helping much either. 

Alex had pushed my shirt and bra up above my breasts and was playing with them with his free hand and mouth. I'm pretty sure I was crying by then.

""Look,"" he was flicking my apparently-hard nipples ""Look how much you like it.""

I had turned my head the other way, and could see the street sign for my stop. 

""I need to go."" I said.

Not 'stop'. Not 'get off of me you fucking pervert'. Just 'I need to go'.

He let go of me and I made my way off of the bus. My mom was worried by the smeared makeup and tears, so I made something up about bullies. I said I was scared, fights were happening, gossip. I asked about homeschool, and she pulled me out then and there. We never moved, but I never saw him again. My only scare was once when I turned the light to my room on, and immediately heard a crash outside. It could've been an animal, but I don't sleep well when I think about it.

Sometimes, I wish I would've reported it. But the authorities in that town weren't much, and I was still covering my trail. Sexual assault vs distribution of, well, my nudes? It wasn't looking good for me. I just hope he hasn't tried it again.

1358559095.0	16up6d	All the Little things Artie did. 	Booty-B	165	34	93	"New readers! [here is the first one](http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/16jgge/artie/) [the second one](http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/16l601/seriously_artie_stop/) [and the third one](http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/16ngmq/baby/)

This will be my last post about Artie. I mean, I hope anyway. I will be sure to keep everyone updated if something else creepy happens between us. I hope nothing will though, I have had enough of Artie. So anyways, I have a few extra stories that aren't really big enough to warrant their own post. Enjoy!

This first one happened a few days after the time he tried to approach me when I was walking my dog. I had to go to the store to pick up some groceries, I walked out to my car and saw a letter and a rose on my windshield. At first I thought it was from my girlfriend, who loves doing gooey romantic things like that. I took the letter and sat in my car to read it. When I unfolded the letter I knew it wasn't from my girlfriend. It wasn't her handwritting. All it said was ""Hannah, forgive me. I love you. -A"" I couldn't move. You know when you're so scared, that you can't really make your muscles do anything? That's how it was. Artie knew where I lived. Creepy. As. Fuck.

The second incident happened when I was at the store with my sister. We were walking down the aisle, just being goofy, when we ran into Artie. It was an accident, not really his fault, but then he started talking to us. Well, more like he started talking to my sister. He kept asking her where different items were located in the store, while staring at me like a creep. My sister had never seen Artie before, so she didn't know it was him. I grabbed her arm and calmly told her in german (german is our first language) that we needed to go, that this was the scary boy. She instantly stopped talking and we walked out of the store and left. Thankfully Artie didn't try following us to the car.

The third was one of the few times he tried calling me. Of course I didn't pick up, but when I went on facebook later that day, I was tagged in one of his pictures. It was a picture captioned ""Just giving all my girl's a good morning call"" and the picture was a screencap of his phone with a list of girl's names and numbers that he had called. None of us had picked up. Not so much creepy as it is funny in a twisted way.

The fourth, and last, story was right after I started dating my girlfriend. I had changed my relationship status on facebook, and not even ten minutes later, Artie posts a status that says ""ImhappyforherImhappyforherImhappyforher"" etc. He tagged me in it. Later, he posted pictures of cuts that he had done on his arm, captioned ""all for her"" I deleted him from my friends list and blocked him right after. Creep.

Thank you so much to all of you who have read my stories, and an even bigger thanks to those of you who offered your sympathy. I don't think I'll ever be the same after what happened, but I know I'm stronger because of it. To those of you who may not believe my stories, that's okay too, I hope you at least thought they were enjoyable to read. They are undoubtedly strange, that's for sure."	t5_2t3t8	True
1357041185.0	15rpig	Crazy ex-stepfather.	taymarieg	166	36	36	"My mom had gotten remarried after her divorce with my dad (happened when I was 3, I'm 18 now) to a man she had met working as a police officer. I didn't like him from the start. Something was just... off about him. My family members and my mom's friends all noticed it too, none of us could put our finger around it, and we all tried telling my mom but she was too head over heels in love with him to really listen. And since we didn't really have much to go off of besides he was just a bit off, she didn't really believe us. Side note, I actually remember on their wedding night (I was about 4 or 5), crying and telling her not to marry him and she just kind of shrugged it off and figured I just wanted her to go back with my dad.


Anyways, they were married for 6 years and had my little sister. Throughout their marriage, he was always extremely rude to me. Hit me sometimes when I didn't deserve it, make fun of me and my real dad all the time and treated me quite unfairly compared to my sister. As if I was just some child that just so happened to live in the same house as him, and not as his daughter. Towards the end of their marriage, things started to go downhill quickly. He would constantly strike up arguments with my mom. Also note, he had pretty much dragged my mom out of mine and my sister's lives. He always loved being the center of attention and couldn't stand when others would have her attention, even if it was her own children. Anyways, there were countless nights where I'd lie awake and hear them screaming at each other in the living room. I later found out that he would threaten to kill himself and threaten to kill her and he would constantly tell her how much of a horrible person she is and all that stuff. 


I remember this one instance where I was sick with a 102 fever and I was laying in my mom's bed (he worked a night shift while my mom worked a morning shift) and she was taking care of me, and he came in, saw that I was in his bed and started screaming, ""WHAT THE FUCK IS SHE DOING IN MY BED?"" when it was quite obvious that I was sick. Then he proceeded to drag her out of the bed and argue with her until she had to go to work the next morning. And also, while she was getting ready for work (this started at about midnight and lasted until about 6 in the morning). 


This last story caused them to both lose their jobs. My mom had found out that he had been going around telling all our neighbors, her friends and even her family that she had been a meth head, that she beat my sister and I and that she would go have sex with many other men while she was with Derek (that was his name). All of which, where absolutely NOT true. So she was fed up, they started arguing, (this happened while I was at my dad's house, thankfully) and he pulled a gun and put it right at her head while my little sister, who was about 3 at the time, was watching the whole thing. He shot off the gun a few times at the wall in their closet and threatened to kill the both of them. The neighbor ended up calling the police and all of this caused both of them to lose their jobs as cops.


My mom was forced to hire an attorney, who made her file charges. He was sent to jail for a total of 30 hours and was sent to a mental institution for 2 weeks. We all had a restraining order against him also. 



Oh, almost forgot. Throughout the last few months of their constant fighting, I remember being home alone with Derek while my mom was at her parents house, seeking advice on what to do and him saying, ""Get dressed. We're gonna go on a drive.""  Then him driving by my grandparents house a few times before going home. I didn't really see anything wrong with it at the time, seeing as how I was only about 6 or 7, but thinking back on it now, it's quite creepy.


Anyways, here's the main story. While finalizing the divorce, my mom had moved us to an apartment that was nearby mine and my sister's elementary school. I was in 5th grade and my mom didn't really want to move us away from all our friends because she knew how stressed out we were because of the divorce and she didn't want any more stress in our lives. After I finished out my 5th grade year, we were going to move in with my grandma. My mom had just started really seeing this guy Richard, whom she and Derek had met at a gym (Derek was really into working out, and was often on steroids). My cousin had stayed the night with me one night and we were about to go take her home when I got this super creepy feeling that came over me. I couldn't quite put my finger around it, but I knew something was wrong. I looked out my window, and saw what looked like Derek's truck parked in one of the spots in front of one of the apartment buildings across from ours. I figured I was just over reacting, and that it couldn't possibly be his truck, because you had to have a key card to get into the apartment complex. 


As we're leaving, we passed by the truck, and I looked at it very closely, and see someone ducking over like they didn't want to be seen. I made the comment, ""that looks a lot like Derek's truck"" and my mom looked, and agreed and said it probably wasn't so we continued driving. We decided to stop at a gas station halfway to my cousins house (we lived about 30 minutes away from her house) and my mom went inside while Richard stayed with my cousin and my sister and I, when Derek pulled up next to us and started screaming at Richard to give him ""his fucking kid back"". My mom races out of the store and jumps in the truck and we take off. Thankfully, we were on a very non-busy road because Derek was trying to ram his truck into ours as we were trying to get away from him. He came so close to actually hitting the car, had it not been for Richard's quick turning (and he would have hit my sister dead on and probably killed her). He cared so much about getting back at my mom that he didn't even care for the safety of his child. Finally he gave up and drove the other way, and we were all crying (except Richard) and dropped Valerie off and went back and filed a police report. Still not sure what kind of trouble he got into for that though.


Throughout the few months that we lived in those apartments, my mom had her car keyed by him, her tires slashed and what's even creepier, we were packing to move to my grandma's house and found a note written by him, explaining how he was in our apartment and took back a few of his things... None of us had given him a key to our apartment, nor told him which apartment was ours. So creepy.


He's pulled a few other shitty things since then, like calling CPS on my mom for doing absolutely nothing (once we moved into our apartment, my mom, sister and I got very close once again). But since then, things have toned way down. My sister absolutely hates going to her dad's, but has to since they have joint custody. She's 13 now and can't wait until she's 18 and legally doesn't have to go over there anymore.

1355092792.0	14ki7w	My 'friend' on the bus..	lightonwater	163	29	24	"Age: 17 Gender: Female. First post, yay!

This story happened to me a few days ago whilst I was taking the bus to hang out with my boyfriend of 2 years. I've taken the same route many-a-time and never have encountered an issue. 

Sitting down on the bus, all was normal until about the second stop. A guy wearing a pretty beat-up leather jacket and a baseball cap jumped on the bus. Immediately, I realised this guy was a bit off. Instead of just handing the bus driver a £5 note like most people would, he dug around in his all his pockets trying to find the £5.80 return fare for his journey. When he was unable to, the bus driver told him he had enough for a single. The man then shouted at the bus driver to 'take all the fuckin' money!' and proceeded to sit down near me. Now, being the awkward teenager I am, I always sit on the outside seat on buses so that no-one will sit next to me and put my belongings on the seat next to me. 

As soon as he sits next to me he begins mumbling saying 'nothing to fuckin' cry about'. He looks at me and says 'don't you agree?' I give him a polite smile and gaze out the window. As the bus journey begins, he starts talking to an old lady and I hope he'll leave me alone and chat to her instead. No such luck. Old lady gets off the bus. His attention is then turned to me which is when the weirdness begins. He asks me where I'm headed, I tell him, he says 'That sounds like a boring place to go on a monday' We begin talking about where he is going and he repeats this over and over: 'whats it like where i'm going? Has it got good pubs and clubs? There's bad people here. My friends are important to me. I have lots of friends where I'm going. As long as you have a good friend, you're ok. Lots of people do drugs here. I don't do drugs. I'm a good guy' I give him another smile, I have one of those big toothy grin smiles, and he stops talking, stares at my mouth and says, 'you've gotta look after your teeth y'know... teeth are important... can't do nothing without teeth' and begins showing me his teeth. Then his demeanor completely changes. He starts saying stuff to me like 'sometimes I just wanna fuckin' end it all. Commit suicide, y'know? Have you ever thought about committing suicide? Have ya? Bet you have, I have. We could do it together y'know? Like one of them suicide pacts. I wouldn't want to live here. If I lived here I'd commit suicide' etc. 

So, the weirdness continues. He asks me about school, my life, blah blah and I lie about it all. I tell him my name is Lucy Smith, which it isn't, and than I'm visiting my aunt, which I wasn't. And then, another lady got on the bus and he goes mental. He grabs at her, trying to shake her hand, touching her jacket, her knee, saying things like 'you know what's good about life? A good fuck! Y'know, sex! I'd fuck you. I bet you love sex. Who's the lucky bloke, your boyfriend? I'd love to see you naked' etc. She just sits there quietly, while I talk to him to try and distract him from her. Until my stop approaches, then it occurs to me that he may follow me off the bus, afraid he would learn where my boyfriend lives. My stop comes and I run to the driver and inform him of the weirdo and then run to my boyfriend's. My boyfriend won't let me ride the bus alone now and drives me everywhere, bless him! I just hope the lady was okay in the end."	t5_2t3t8	True
1342635709.0	wrspn	The Screaming Man	jicksenmane4	160	29	14	"After reading a few stories, I realised I had to share my own unnerving encounter.

I had just been to the bar with some buddies and, once it had closed at midnight, we had gone back to my buddies place to drink a bit more, and generally horseshit around, as young and wild teenagers do.

Eventually all of my buddies either crashed out or left to go home so I decided I'd better head out as well, considering it was getting to around 3:00 or so in the morning. I bid farewell to my buddy, step outside and begin the half hour walk back to my place, drunk off my head, of course.

I cut through a park that's halfway between my buddy and my place, and as I pass a tunnel, I become distinctly aware of a loud howl coming from it. I stopped, scared to death as to why the hell there as howling coming from a tunnel. The howling would carry on for a few minutes, then stop, then start, then stop. I figured if somebody's in trouble I need to help, and, being as drunk I was, it didn't occur to me that it might not have been a brilliant idea to just wander into a dark tunnel after some howling in the early hours of the morning.

I take a few steps inside, the howling amplified by about 10x by this point, and peer into the darkness. At first I could see nothing, but after about five seconds, the figure of a homeless-looking man (on account of his untrimmed hair and beard) came into view, and, with horror, I realised he was staring right at me.

I lost my shit, and sprinted the last ten minutes home, hardly taking a breath. I locked myself in and ended up being unable to sleep, so just comforted myself with the safety of TV and Reddit until it was late enough to re-enter society.

Horrible experience, 0/10, would not have again."	t5_2t3t8	True
1376410960.0	1kaahk	Creeper at work	zizabeth	161	30	19	"I used to bartend at night at this little restaurant in a small town. No big deal all kinds of people came in and we normally had a lot of fun. My two bosses would always come over at the end of the night and sit and drink a couple beers and we'd all talk. 

One night it was me and another girl and she had to leave early so I was there by myself to do all the clean up. We normally closed about 1:30-2ish depending on the crowd and then clean up took anywhere from 30 mins - 1 hour. So I was up there with my bosses cleaning up when a guy came in. It was about 1245 we had been pretty dead that night so I was trying to finish up and head home. The kitchen had closed hours before but he said he was hungry so I offered to go back and make him a sandwich. I figured it'd be fine for him to stick around because my boss was there and he wouldn't be making a mess. I thought he'd drink a beer or two eat the sandwich and skiddadle. 

I gave him his sandwich and started sweeping the floor and wiping down tables and chairs. As I'm working I'm starting to feel a little creeped out so I look up and this guy is watching me in the mirror behind the bar. So I just smile finish wiping my table and go check on him. I ask if he needs another beer or maybe some water and he says no and then starts making small talk. I'm fine to answer his questions cuz hey that's my job. Then he starts asking me what I'm doing when I get off work. Where I live, if I live alone, what I drive. To say the least I was getting pretty creeped out. I looked at my boss D and jokingly said the way these two are acting I'll probably never get out of here. I guess it was something in my voice because then D started talking to the guy and kept an eye on him after that. The guy finished his sandwich and D told him he better head out since we were trying to close. The guy paid out and left me a huge tip for his sandwich which I tried to tell him I couldn't take that much but he was very insistent and pushy so I just said thanks and went to finish cleaning up.

The guy left and as soon as the door closed I walked over and locked it. At this bar the outside is glass and we have a patio with a fence around it so you can't really see the parking lot on the side. While he was walking away he watched me through the glass the whole time and it really creeped me out. I tried to just laugh it off because I figured I was just being silly. I finished cleaning up about a half hour later and then sat with D and had a beer. My other boss had gone to count money. D was an older fatherly type, he could be a hard ass but I always enjoyed talking to him after the shift. 

I finished my beer and was about to walk out the door, but I still felt uneasy. So I asked D if he wouldn't mind just walking me to the end of the fence. I laughed it off because really no big deal I'm just being a silly girl, but that guy had really shooken me up. D agreed and walked me out. As we got to the end of the fence there was a truck sitting towards the back of the parking lot and it looked like someone was in it. As soon as we turned the truck started up and pulled out really fast, throwing up gravel. I just knew it was the guy who had been in the bar before, it was a small town and the truck was unrecognizable. After that night when we closed up one of the bosses always walked us to our cars.

1376335409.0	1k84t2	I had a stalker for months	vi0letwaves	147	16	41	"About two years ago, when I was 25, I managed the graveyard shift at a pharmacy (the actual pharmacy was closed, but the front store stayed open) that was the only thing open for miles. I used to have a lot of regulars that would come in for cigarettes, some late night snacks, and small talk. I never really had a problem with making small talk until this one customer, Jon. He used to come in every single night and buy a pack of Marlboro Reds. We'd chat for a few, sometimes I would smoke a cigarette outside with him and shoot the shit for a few minutes. I never thought anything of it, until he started telling me about his ""girlfriend"". 


This is where it starts to get weird. He kept talking to me about the problems he was having with his girlfriend, Vicki. How she has a special needs son and how he tore their relationship apart because she had to sell her house and move to somewhere way down in Virginia (I live in northern Maryland). Then he says that her sister kicked her out of the house because of her son and she's living in a homeless shelter now and shit like that. Then he goes on to tell me his ideas to get her back. These would be: calling the homeless shelter where she's at and telling them she's a drug addict so they'll kick her out and she'll have to come to him or destroying her car so that she'll have to come back and rely on him then advancing onto the straight kidnapping and bringing her home. So at this point I'm keeping it cool talking to him telling him that these are all really bad ideas that will land him in jail (though in my head I'm like WTF is wrong with you dude? You are legit crazy). There was a lot more that he told me about this whole thing but I honestly don't remember much of it. It's mainly just to give you an idea of how messed up he is. I later found out that his ""girlfriend"" ran away from him and ended up in a homeless shelter because that was fucking preferable to being with him.


So not long after he starts telling me about these problems with his girlfriend (I literally could NOT avoid this guy, every night like clockwork he would come in) and I'm like man, you just gotta let her go, he starts hitting on me. Now, I was 25 at the time and this dude is in his 50's. I later found out he went to high school with my uncle. So now I'm really getting creeped out by this guy, but I did my best to minimize our interactions. One night I had a big ass truck with blacked out windows sitting in my parking lot for 5 hours. Truck running, but I never saw the driver. So I called the cops (they used to come in and check on us every night and I was on good terms with them) and I don't know if the truck had a police scanner or what, but right before my two cop buddies pulled up he high tailed it out of there. 


That's when things got really weird for me. Jon came in the next morning and tore my coworker Kim a new one because evidently he was the person in that truck that I called the police on. Then he started following me when I would leave in the morning. Now, I lived about 20 miles from where I worked and when I noticed him I started taking all these crazy routes home (I literally know just about every single back road there is around here, even the ones that aren't paved) and I always managed to lose him. At this point I was really starting to get freaked out by this guy. I talked to the police, they told me there was nothing they could do at this point. So I brushed it off, refused to wait on him, stayed aware, and never took the same route home.  Which worked for a few weeks.


I should mention at this point that Jon runs a mobile mechanic service. Anyway, I was leaving work one morning and headed up the main road and my car felt weird. Something was off in the tire and it was enough that I freaked out and went to my friend's brother's house that was just up the road because he was a mechanic. All except 2 of my lug nuts (which were inset lug nuts) on my tires were gone. That feeling that had me freaked out? Yeah, that was my tire starting to come off my Eclipse. My friends brother fixed my car up and sent me on my way. I was shaken up by the whole thing, but I went home hell bent on getting some sleep. I got home and decided to check my facebook before heading to bed. I open it up and see I have a message. From Jon. Who had no idea what town I lived in or what my last name was (and nobody I work with divulged that information - I checked). My facebook settings are ridiculously private and my first name is REALLY common. And what did the message say?


""Need any work done to your car?""


I am not even fucking kidding. Jesus, I wish I was. So at this point I am about damn near hysterical because this has gotten to the point where I didn't know what to do anymore. I was still living at home but hadn't told my parents about the creepy things going on yet because I felt like I had a handle on things and didn't want to worry them. I finally went upstairs and told my mom and dad everything that had been happening up to the mornings events and the facebook message. At this point we call the cops again to see if there is anything that can be done. They tell us nope, he has to make a threat. My company won't ban him because he isn't doing anything on company property. The police just suggested that I get a different job.


So at this point I'm thinking that I'm going to have to take matters into my own hands. This guy has been following me around, then the car thing and him finding me on facebook. So my mother and I look up his arrest record (that stuff is all online and public record in MD). This guy has PAGES of records. Scary stuff. A lot of assault and battery charges, possession of an illegal handgun, multiple restraining orders, harassment charges, false imprisonment, trespassing, resisting arrest, violations of said restraining orders... the list goes on. 


This stuff went on for a few months, I kept a knife and pepper spray on me at all times. He would follow me, make up new facebook accounts after I would block him, eventually ended up calling my work and tried to say that I was dealing drugs in the parking lot (I wasn't). That was the point where my job finally started looking into him and his harassment (they still ended up doing nothing). I finally found a new (and much, much better paying) job and things calmed down.

I was at my new job for about six months when I got into a car accident that totaled my car. I bought a new one and it made me a lot more comfortable because I was still worried about Jon creeping around and following me. Which seemed to be working out awesome, until I ran into him at the gas station one morning. He followed me 35 miles to work that day. Then he started waiting at the gas station I passed every morning and following me. I would go to the Avenue (like an outdoor mall area?) and he would be standing there lingering against a building, watching. One morning I was sitting at a red light and he was behind me (I always, always keep my doors locked) and he got out and walked up to my window and tried to get me to get out saying I had a tail light out. I didn't. The car was brand new. 


I tried calling the cops again and getting them to do something and they told me again that they couldn't do anything. At this point I decided fuck it, I'm going to have to do something about this myself. My boyfriend had been itching to take care of things himself anyway when the cops proved fruitless. I honestly don't know what him and my guy friends did, but I do know that the stalking shit stopped real quick after I gave him the green light to handle it. I know Jon is still around the area, but I haven't seen him and he hasn't tried to contact me or anything like that since then.


The thing that's scariest about this though, is that this went on for almost a year. He had a history of being violent and crazy and nobody would do a god damn thing to make sure that he didn't do anything crazy to me.


TL;DR: Crazy, violent guy stalks me for the better part of a year. Steals my lug nuts almost causing me to get into a bad car accident and police didn't care. Boyfriend ended up laying the smack down and handling it when no one else would.

EDIT: Took down his FB link, but had people asking what he looks like. If you see this guy, stay away. He's crazy as shit.

1369592368.0	1f3bgt	Unwanted touching in Walmart from a stranger.	ChrisHernandez	163	29	31	"So I was working for Verizon fios as a sales rep. I contracted to go to various walmarts, bestbuys, and other electronic stores to sell fios to customers. I set up a table with brochures and other goodies to get potential customers attention. It was a great job for $19.95 hour. 

So on this particular day I set up a table in the electronics section in Walmart. I had two Hispanic males come to my table, they had a heavy accent when they spoke English. Trying to understand them was difficult. Well one male walked slightly off and the other male said he wanted to surprise him.

Having worked in jewelry stores before I had many customers slip me their credit card and to secretly pick something out while their SO was not looking. So that's what I thought was going on here.

The male says hey come over here to the toy aisle. The toy aisle was one aisle over, but out of view of my table. I say ok...

We go to the toy aisle and are facing each other, I am slightly taller but he is bigger. He tells me I have nice shoes. I say thanks. Then ask what services he wants to get? He then proceeds to ask where I bought my shoes, I say some store. He then goes on one knee to get a closer look at my shoes.

Then he grabs my ankle very firmly and slips off my laceless shoes, and proceeds to massage my foot. He had a very strong grip on my ankle, but I managed to yank my foot away.

I yelled wtf is wrong with you!?

Then grabbed my shoe as he had this sick grin on his face.

I walked back to my table and felt so weird and uneasy and just reenacted the events over and over in my head thinking what I could have done differently.

Tl;Dr some customer in Walmart takes of my shoe and tries to massage my foot."	t5_2t3t8	True
1363395433.0	1aduxk	SWF just looking to do her job.	Red1332	163	31	31	"Guess what? This one's in Seattle again (the place was just a petri dish of learning opportunities for a naive little country gal like myself) and this is the second worst thing that happened to me while I lived there.

Towards the end of my time there I managed to land a job as the evening front desk person at a small hotel off of I-5 (a major highway) north of Seattle. In my mind I call it ""the Korean hotel"" because everybody there but me was Korean, but really it was on par with Motel 6 and nothing Korean about it.

I was already at my place at the front desk for the late afternoon/early evening trickle of guests to come in the doors, and it had been stressed to me that they NEEDED people in their rooms, as things had been slow lately.
This man comes in looking like a strung out Anthony Bourdain, complete with close-cropped white hair, button down shirt and blue jeans. I even think he had cowboy boots on. Something about him seemed off, probably because he stopped in the lobby and stared up at the 70's-fantastic chandelier for a good minute before coming towards the desk.

Once he got there he leaned on the desk and started asking about rooms. I was polite and sweet and wanted to get people in the door to prove myself, so I was quick to answer all of his questions. While doing this, I get the weird feeling he's not listening, or something's wrong and he can't focus because he keeps looking past me to the hallway that leads to the first floor rooms.

I also note as he leans forward that a horrible smell washes over me. He smells like acetone and 1000 proof alcohol, and I realize the only way he smells that bad is if he's had that in his body for days and days. Thankfully, I think, he'll be upstairs and out of my hair soon.

He has, at this point, tried to turn the charm on and was chatting me up, so I did my best to be friendly and get him his key and get him out of there. It *almost* worked.

As he was going upstairs, he turned and said ""Hey, I didn't catch your name..."". So I answered ""Kelly"". And when he heard that, something happened to his entire demeanor.

""Kelly?"" he said, sliding in close to the desk again, ""I knew a girl named Kelly. She and I used to be very close. Very close."" He stared at me for a second and started to twitch and move his hands, ""she didn't look anything like you, though. Dark hair, taller. I remember Kelly.""

I had noooo clue how to deal with this, so I just smiled and said well that was neat and to have a good evening. Except he stayed.

""Man... I really did Kelly wrong. I really did."" He paused a long moment, then looked up at me with an intense stare and said ""You don't want to know what I did to Kelly.""

I replied I really didn't and I hoped he had a good night. But he didn't leave. He dropped his gym bag on the floor and started to fidget right there at the desk, repeating over and over ""Man, I really hurt her. I hurt her so bad. I feel so bad now. I wish I hadn't done that..."" over and over, staring off in to space, just twitching and swaying. If I moved, his eyes snapped over to me and he would just say ""I'm really sorry, Kelly.""

So...yeeeah. I was freaked out.

Luckily another couple showed up and he twitched away, saying ""Don't let anybody give you a hard time!"", disappearing in to the bowels of the hotel.

I thought that was over and I could go back to reading for the evening.

Nope.

20 minutes later he comes down in to the lobby swinging a baseball bat, and begins pacing the length of the lobby. I realize he's muttering but I can't figure out what. Curiousity gets the better of me, so I slide over to the far side of the desk and lean out to hear what he's saying as he swings by.

""I'm not gonna let anybody hurt you this time. Nobody's messing with you this time,"" over and over and over, with his eyes darting wildly around.

I was completely freaked out at this point, especially when he lunged over to the desk, slapped his hand down and stared me down saying ""NOT THIS TIME. I'M NOT HURTING YOU THIS TIME, YOU'RE GONNA BE SAFE."" Then back to pacing and muttering.

At that point I grabbed the phone and dragged it as far as the cord would allow in to the back office where I closed the door and proceeded to make a panicked phone call to the police (all the while wondering if I might be over reacting and about to be laughed at)

The police did not think I was overreacting. Unfortunately because I had disappeared, so had Crazy Bat Guy, off to I don't know where. I nervously came back out and put the phone back, managing a smile for some people who showed up to book a room.

The police showed up rather quickly, without a lot of noise (which I was grateful for, as I didn't want guests exiting due to seeming shenanigans going on) and I directed them to his room. Once again, I thought everything was over.

Except as they went up in the elevator, Crazy Bat guy came busting out the doors to the stairs, this time with cigarettes. He lit one and began to fidget, staring at the cop cars. He even went out and flicked a cigarette at one before lighting up and walking back in.

When I told the guy he couldn't smoke in the lobby, he ignored me and instead informed me, ""I fucking hate cops. Pigs. Always messing with me. Cops hate me. I hate them back. I'd stab one of I had the chance.""

*Oh fuck*, I thought.... thinking that now the cops were in serious danger.

""Nobody's fucking with you tonight. I'm here. Nobody's touching you,"" he said, pointing at me with his cigarette, then going outside to pace back and forth and spit on the cop cars.

The cops finally came back DOWNSTAIRS, and I pointed out the crazy guy, letting them know what he'd said about stabbing them. They sprang in to action, running out the door and getting him on the ground immediately. He was in handcuffs before I could even blink, and a second later they were retrieving everything, including the bat, from his hotel room.

As they left, one of the cops told me that the acetone smell was probably due to meth, and that he looked like he was tweaking pretty bad. He then advised me to call immediately if the guy showed back up in the next week, as they could only hold him for so long.

Thankfully, he never did, and I ended up with a hell of a story to tell.

TL:DR Crazy meth guy gets fixated on my name and proceeds to tweak out with a baseball bat in the lobby of the hotel I worked at."	t5_2t3t8	True
1357971246.0	16fcjt	The Man with The Shank	Optickone	158	27	13	"As soon as I found this subreddit I knew I had finally found the 	 appropriate forum to post the most terrifying experience of my entire life. The reason I'm posting this here instead of r/nosleep is because the entire events of my story could have been pretty much a word for word script of a hollywood horror film and I didn't want this to be confused with a work of fiction. Looking back at what happened even I can barely believe it. Anyway here goes...


When I was 16 years old my best friend Odin and his family invited me on a trip to the Costa Del Sol in Spain. Odin's dad had organised a day out quad racing so we had to walk a good distance from where we were staying to get a bus to our destination. The bus stop we were waiting in was situated on the outskirts of an empty parking lot which was being overlooked by a pretty large abandoned building on a slight hill. It was surrounded by shrubs and a run down metal grated fence. The building itself looked almost abnormal, out of place in comparison to the rest of the beautiful scenery.


Anyway, myself and Odin at the time were obsessed with Street art/graffiti and from where we were standing we noticed the entire buildings exterior wall was covered in giant murals and graffiti pieces. The bus was going to take another 20 minutes to arrive and we couldn't resist checking it out so Odin asked his mam if we head over and take some pictures. It was the middle of the afternoon and she could see us from the bustop so she told us to go ahead.


As odd as the building was, my 16 year old self bounced towards it without hesitation. In the glistening sun light it didn't look as menacing as my initial analysis had perceived. We scurried through the car park and followed the fence to a gap we could get through. As soon as we got to the top of the hill we were embraced with some of the most beautiful graffiti I had ever seen in person. We walked up the front door and noticed a massive padlock and chain so Odin and I began circling the building snapping as many pictures as we could with our disposable cameras until we arrived at the very back of the building and stumbled upon a medium sized hole in the wall. It was just big enough to squeeze through. As I peered inside I noticed even more graffiti lining the interior walls and my naive 16 year old self didn't even think twice about scrambling through the hole to get a better look. (Never even considered that if anything happened there was zero chance of both of us getting back out through that hole at the same time.)


The floors inside were covered in litter, broken glass and rubble. The place was a complete dump. Odin and myself walked through the first room and peered down a long hallway. Every single wall was plastered with either amazing art pieces or scribbled tags except for this one room at the very end of the corridor. It looked almost refurbished with a clean floor and gleaming white walls. The room would have looked completely out of place if it hadn't been for a single wall that had a sentence in Spanish sprawled across it. (Seemingly by hand in what seemingly looked like red paint.) Looking back now I can honestly say we didn't even consider it suspicious considering the rest of the graffiti. By this stage we had been exploring for a good five minutes and decided it best to head back before Odin's mam got worried. We said we would come back and explore properly when we had more time.



So a few days later we got up early and told Odin's mam we were heading out for a walk and maybe a swim at the beach. This time as we arrived at the front of the building and for a reason unbeknownst to me I walked up and gave the padlock and chain a shake. To my complete surprise the chain slid off the door handle where it must have been cut with a bolt cutters. Now I know at this stage to most people alarm bells should have started ringing but without hesitation I looked back at Odin with a giant grin and we pushed our way through the giant wooden doors.


The first thing we noticed from this side of the building was an open upper floor overlooking an inside courtyard of sorts. As we headed further towards it I noticed a couple of spray cans heaped on a pile of rubble and this is where the seed of dread slowly started creeping into my mind. As I began rummaging excitedly to find out if any of the spray cans were full something caught my attention. It was barely poking out behind some rubbish so I picked it up to inspect it. After glancing it over I handed it to Odin feeling sick to the very core of my stomach. He looked at it in disgust and flung it back into the rubbish. It was a a set of photos crudely printed onto a laminated sheet of paper in what appeared to be a nude 10-12 year old girl in various sexual positions. Thinking back we should have walked out then and there but instead we shrugged it off and marched on into the courtyard.


We soon found ourselves in the centre of the courtyard taking pictures of more graffiti on a pillar. I looked up and noticed the upstairs was surrounded by an open balcony leading into several rooms. As we were bending down inspecting something my ear picked up the tiniest whisper of what was distinctively the crunch of someone ""sneaking"" a footstep on glass. I instantly bolted up and scanned the surrounding area in a small panic. I had no idea what direction it came from but I knew it was to far to be us. I blurted out to Odin , ""What the fuck was that?!"" He spun around bewildered, ""What was what?"" I shook it off as my imagination and I didn't want to look like a coward so I reluctantly said, ""Nevermind, I thought I heard something.""


So we continue our inspection of this filthy rundown courtyard but this time for me the entire atmosphere had suddenly shifted and this fun little adventure had become much more chilling . Since I heard the noise I could swear I could feel someone watching me but as I looked around we seemed to be completely alone. No sooner am I beginning to contemplate telling my friend we should get going an entire flock of birds that had been perched on the upper floor suddenly burst out in a giant ""squak!"" as if they had been suddenly startled by something. Odin turns around laughing holding his heart jokingly, I return a forced laugh but the voice in my head is urging me to hurry up, almost pleading me to leave at this point. I knew deep down that we hadn't made any sudden movements and it was very unnatural for the birds to take off with such a fright. It reminded me of a shitty horror film where you're rolling your eyes telling the actors to get the fuck out! 


Im quite a paranoid guy so when my friend noticed a way up to the second floor across the courtyard my heart sank. Once again the thought of seeming like a pussy got to me so I agreed to have a quick look upstairs. We climbed up the narrow staircase and with each step it felt like more and more of a terrible idea. From here on out everything happened so fast that I had to slow it down considerably.


When we reached the top of the staircase we walked over to the first doorway. That's when I noticed it. In the middle of the room surrounded by debris and litter was a perfectly placed red leather chair. It was old and worn out but when I studied it more closely I got this horrible feeling that someone had recently been sitting in that very chair. Not in the last month or even week but literally the last five minutes. I know it sounds strange but it looked ""warm"" and slightly creased as if someone had just got up. Just as im about to divulge this information to Odin he shouts, ""Oh shit, Look!"" He points over to a mound of rubble where there gazing directly at us is a small mouse standing on its hind legs. Im instantly distracted by it and pull out my camera to take a picture. Odin does the same but leans into the room to get a better shot. I turn around at this point and decided to walk to the next room. 


Everyone has felt the feeling im about to describe. As soon as I begin walking to the next room every fibre in my body screams at me to turn around. In that split second and don't ask me how I knew something was horribly wrong. I spun around and was petrified by something that will forever be etched into my nightmares. Odin was still leaning into the room looking for the mouse with his camera glued to his face and just beyond him in the next doorway a man quickly attempts to hide before I see him. He was easily in his late forties with long unkempt grey hair and glasses, his eyes were wide open in a frenzy piercing right through me, the rest of his face was as motionless as a corpse. He was around 6ft3, big build and shirtless except for a pair of torn cargo pants. Covered in filth head to toe but what had me frozen on the spot was what he was a holding. It looked like he had attached a large metal shank to a piece of wood and as he slid back into hiding I felt nauseous. The scariest part of the whole experience was that it wasn't just some homeless man protecting his territory as I'd expect he would have shouted, made noise and do the usual to try to scare a couple of kids away. 


But instead he was waiting. 


Hiding in the shadows waiting for his perfect moment as we would inevitably walk past him. ""FUCKING RUN!"" I yelled at the top of my lungs running towards Odin and yanking him by the collar. Odin didn't hesitate for a second. He told me after just from the sheer terror in my voice that his brain made the decision for him without even looking up. As soon as I opened my mouth the man with shank in hand erupted from his hiding spot and darted towards us freakishly agile for his size. I felt like shitting my pants


We ran.


I have never ran so fast in my entire life. We barrelled down the staircase almost tripping up over each other in a craze of sheer unadulterated terror. At this point the man was howling something but there was so much adrenaline bursting through my body all I could hear was a constant buzz drowning out the sounds of yelling and crashing. We sprinted across the courtyard and headed straight for the front door throwing our bodies against it as hard as we could. To our utter dismay the door didn't budge. The man was getting closer and closer and thousands of thoughts raced through my head in those split seconds. 


Then at the exact same time we realised we had to pull the door! We flung the door open and burst out into the open running through the fence and out into the car park where we just kept running and running. We didn't say a word to each other as we broke out into a jog.


Even though by this stage we knew he hadn't followed us out of the building our feet wouldn't allow us to stop until we eventually came upon a populated supermarket where was just flung ourselves on the floor and lay there panting. After about five minutes of lying there in shock we abruptly stood up without a word and just walked into the supermarket browsing the aisles. Finally Odin stammered, ""Nobody is going to fucking believe this, holy shit.""


**TL;DR: Man attempts to creep up and shank my friend and I. Scarred for life but the silver lining is a great story to tell.**

1353646537.0	13njtz	"""Someone who lives with you is with me."""	tetewhyelle	157	26	20	"So this is my first post here and this is possibly in the top 5 scariest things that ever happened to me. I am 19 year old female and this happened in late August-early September 2012. I don't remember the exact date.

As a child my biggest fear was somebody breaking into my house. I don't know why since I lived in a very wealthy and safe neighborhood where break ins very rarely happened. But that was my biggest childhood fear. Not the monster under the bed or a ghost in the closet. I was scared a legit bad person breaking into my bedroom window. 

So, a few months ago my boyfriend was working this terrible job at a bowling alley where he closed nearly every night, meaning he wouldn't get home from work until around 3:30-4:00 AM in the morning. I usually waited up for him because I had trouble sleeping alone but on this one particular night, I had work very early the following morning so I had opted to go to bed. It was very creepy being in our condo alone and it took me a while to sleep. It's mostly eerie because we live on the first floor and our bedroom window is on the wall to the left of the front door. There are also a set of stairs not very far from our doorstep that lead to the upstairs condos. I know that doesn't necessarily sound creepy but when you're hearing people walk around outside your bedroom window all night....well you get the idea. 

This one night, it took me a little longer than usual to fall asleep(I think it was a Friday night) but I finally passed out around 1:30AM. Close to 3:00AM, I kinda slowly come to consciousness as I hear the front door knob being turned. I initially got excited, thinking it was my boyfriend finally home from work and started to get up to go meet him. (I knew he hated that job and tried to be extra affectionate when he did arrive home) I'm halfway out of bed when I realize the door isn't opening and I hear someone start cursing outside my window. I stopped to listen for a second, thinking maybe I heard someone opening the door upstairs. I heard was sounded like someone trying to jimmy the door and then make a kick at the wall out of frustration. My bedroom wall, right under my window, right next to where I was sitting. Looking back on this, I should have just called the cops right there but my half asleep mind wasn't so intelligent. I thought maybe my boyfriend had forgotten his key or something so incredibly smart me decides to go check it out. (Just like those blondes in the horror flicks) So I get up, put on pants and a hoodie, grabbed my phone and left my bedroom. My half-asleep mind while being unintelligent had a part that realized, ""oh shit, this is a bad idea"" because I stopped in the kitchen to grab a knife and hid it in my hoodie.

I slowly opened the front door and at first I didn't see anyone so I started to close the door, but then this older guy walked back around the corner. My mind was screaming that something was wrong the moment I saw him. He was probably in his 50's or so. He had wrinkly skin, white-gray hair and a couple of teeth missing that I saw when he smiled at me. He was slightly bent over, like he had a hunched back, and he was wearing a dirty tshirt, ragged jeans, and carrying a black duffel bag.

""Hey, I have your -uh.. someone who lives with you is with me. She's really tipsy and said she needed a ride home."" His voice low and raspy as he takes a hesitant step in my direction.

My initial thought was my boyfriends crazy drug addicted ex-gf was on a trip and thought she still lived here. I started to get pissed but then I remembered she was still in jail so that wasn't possible. As I'm trying to analyze that situation, he's still stepping closer to me. I closed the door a little more and said, ""I'm sorry, no other woman besides myself lives here.""

""What? This is 1234 Pretend Address Lane, right?"" He didn't look like he believed me and his voice was getting a hint of anger to it which only frightened me more.

""Yes but no other girl besides myself lives here."" My voice sounded a lot more confident than I actually felt.

""Well is there another Pretend Address Lane?"" He's about two feet away from me at this point, I can smell his rancid breath and got look at this crazed look in his eye.

""No there isn't."" I'm getting the mega creeps and at this point considering calling the police. The way he was protectively holding that black duffel bag told me it was bad news in there.

Our conversation was pretty much cyclic of the above for several minutes and that's when I realized this guy wasn't just a little off, he was definitely not all right. Whether he was drunk or high, I didn't know and frankly I didn't really care. He was swaying slightly and still smiling creepily down at me(I'm very petite so the thought of fighting my way past this guy wasn't an option). I wish I could describe the way he was smiling at me better, but there are no words and it still gives me the chills to this day. At this point I am getting really scared because he keeps gesturing to the woman in question, but I can't see her. She's not in my view at all. So I'm beginning to wonder if there even is someone with him or if he tried to break in and was covering his ass with this bullshit story. 

I basically decide I'm done with this and go to close the door, when he turns and starts to talk to someone I can't see. ""Hey man, is this the only 1234 Pretend Address?""
My boyfriend walks into view at this point. ""Uh yeah?"" He gives me the ""Are you okay?"" look and I gave him the ""I'm fucking terrified"" look. He gets the message and slides into the space between the guy and myself, then pushed back so that he was standing in the doorway and I was now in the house. The whole time my boyfriend is talking to Mr. Creepy who eventually asks for a phone. My boyfriend tells him to wait a second so he can put his things down. We close the door and my boyfriend tells me he's going to go out there and that I need to call the police. However, he opens the door and a cop is already questioning him. Apparently someone else in the condo saw him driving around without any lights on all sketchy and called the cops. The officer later told us that he asked the guy if he had seen a black car and the guy replied to say that he had a black car.

Turns out there was a woman really with him. She had lived at the address six years ago and had been evicted, but never changed her drivers license. They'd been at a party and he'd tried to go home with her. We watched while the cops searched them and arrested them. They found straws and coke in the woman's purse and more straws in the guys pockets. When we showed him the black bag, that had been left near our door, the cop opened it up and found BRICKS of coke. Then not long after that an ambulance had to be called as the woman was overdosing and had been passed out in the grass the whole time the guy was talking to me.  The guy apparently was later to have been found to have a combination of coke, alcohol, and meth in his system. Fucking idiot. To this day, I still get the chills just thinking about it. That guy was high out of his mind, probably had no idea what he was doing and could have done a lot of really bad things.  I'm just thankful my boyfriend and the cop showed up when they did.


TL;DR Woke up to someone trying to get in my door, half-asleep me thought it was my boyfriend and opened the door, turned out to be a cracked out crazy guy with a woman who had been evicted years ago.

1343538995.0	xbxke	Delivery Men	leeshapwnz	166	33	18	"I must have been about 16 or 17 when this happened.  My parents had an extremely old refrigerator that we had been rigging for a while. Finally they decided it was time to break down and buy a new one.  They went and picked out the new fridge at a local appliance store, and set up delivery for a few days later.

I'll never understand why, but my dad decided to have the fridge delivered on a day when neither of my parents or brother would be home, just me.  He also felt it wise to tell the people delivering it that he wouldn't be home, ""but my daughter will.""

So comes the day of delivery, and there's a knock at the door. I look out the window to confirm it's the delivery guys before opening the door, and it is.  These guys were total skeezeburgers. I think they had 7 teeth between the two of them, and both looked like they hadn't showered or washed their clothes in a month of Sundays.

I opened the door and the pair of them just kind of leered at me for a second. Then one says, ""there she is."" and the other responds with, ""yeap."" They then proceeded to kind of chuckle for a few seconds before attempting to come into the house (without the fridge).

Luckily, I had preemtively asked my boyfriend to come wait for the delivery with me. Before the creeps crossed the threshold, my knight in shining armor rounded the corner and said, ""Oh good, the fridge is here.""

The goons then reluctantly went to their truck to get the fridge, and installed it, all the while muttering and cursing under their breath with scowls on their faces.

TL;DR I was almost raped by the cast of Deliverance."	t5_2t3t8	True
1340642764.0	vkucn	My stepfather	trixiebix	154	20	43	"Sorry if it’s poorly written, I am not a writer. I have been thinking of telling this story for a while, but didn’t want to be judged.
My mom met my late stepfather when I was a senior in high school.

First bunch of years I didn't see anything weird with him. He was a fun guy, and I enjoyed hanging out with him. It wasn't until about 4 years into their relationship things got strange.

At first I would wake up at night and see him looking in my bedroom. I thought weird, but I'll just start locking my door. So I did that. My mom asked me one day why my door was locked, I gave the “I’m an adult (22 or so) I want my privacy” excuse. We lived in the second floor apartment of a 3 family house.

He had a house in another state as well, kind of a vacation home. And he would do the same spying on me thing when we’d go there. 
I finally got out (kind of) when I started renting the basement apartment.  My fiancé lived with me. 

When I was around 25, we broke off the engagement.  Soon after, I was sitting on the couch with stepdad,  my mom was in the kitchen, and he was telling me it would be ok, I’d find someone else and he kind of gave me a creepy slow kiss on the cheek. 

Then my mom went away for a weekend, and I was alone. Stepdad rang my bell, and handed me some food he made. He leaned in and creepily kissed both of my cheeks. I pulled away and said “Thanks, bye” and shut the door. I had to push him back.

One day I was about to take a shower and I thought I saw feet outside my bathroom window (remember I’m in the basement). Like someone was sitting in front of it, but facing away. Just as I started undressing, I saw him looking in the window. I waved (because I wasn’t quite sure I believed what I was seeing). He waved back. I called my ex, and was freaking out… what do I do? He didn’t really have any answers. I considered calling the cops and saying there was a peeping Tom. But by the time I got back to the bathroom he was gone. I saw feet there quite a few times. Now there is no reason for him to sit there but to look in my window. We didn’t ever use the first floors backyard. From then on, I kind of kept my distance. I made sure I was never alone with him. 
About 8 years ago they moved out of state to his other house. So I didn’t have to see him often. They also got married.  I would always make sure I went with my husband because I didn’t want him spying on me. His attitude started to change since he got sick (diabetes with amputations and heart condition). He didn’t joke like he used to and he was always cranky. And he scared me. He owned a gun and I had images of him killing us.

I have always struggled with whether or not to tell my mom. Part of me was afraid of what he would do. He had mafia connections, had a gun, and like I said I often imagined he would kill us.  I was also afraid of what my mom would do. Would she believe me? I would ruin her marriage. I always thought “well, now he’s sick, he doesn’t have much longer… hopefully”  

He died a couple years ago… and I feel like a weight is off my shoulders. I can visit my mom without fear now. I have only told my dad, stepmom and husband.

1332530779.0	rae2e	A predator in my home(prelude to I owe her my life)	Gothichu	159	25	27	"I posted a few days ago, about my dog Reggie, saving us from danger

 back in 2005. I figured since the story was successful I'd inform the 

readers of things that occurred shortly after this man tried to break

 into our home. My dog developed a severe mistrust of men after this incident. 

She had to know them very well to be mildly civil around them. 

If strangers walked into our apartment, or near it, she'd surge at 

them, and we'd have to grab her rather quickly to prevent damage, 
as she'd go for the crotch region almost every time. We couldn't really chide her for her paranoia. 

Those of you that read the story I'd posted earlier would see why she was this way. 

Soon after this event, my mom met a man named Jamie Cochran. 

They began dating. Reggie hated this man, and refused to have anything to do with him. 

We chalked it up to the near break-in incident and moved on, taking precaution when he was coming over.

Reg always had to go outside during these visits. And she was not pleased with this.

She soon began showing her angst against him by finding his boots, and literally shitting in them, peeing on his clothes, or other such shenanigans.

Once again we just explained to Jamie why she had such a great mistrust for men. He seemed to accept and forgive this. 

Soon after my mother and Jamie met, they were engaged. I was quite off-put by this. 
But my mom was at a point in her life where she didn't care about herself anymore, just anything that might benefit us girls. 

We tried to convince her not to go through with it, but she did, and we decided to take it with a grain of salt, and maybe we'd see what she saw in him.

He was off. There was something in his eyes that just made you uneasy.

 Maybe it was just me. As I was just 13, and my older sisters were out of the house more and more, leaving me to my own devices.

Only Reggie shared in my slight mistrust of this gentleman. 

He was polite enough, and tried to dote on us, but I took it as him bribing me to keep quiet and out of his way. 

Most of the time if one of us expressed our concern for one of her beaus, she'd have him out the door in a matter of minutes.

This time, my mom was tired, and insecure. Owning a business, and dealing with other problems was getting to her. 

I think she kept him around because she was lonely. I wouldn't say I would blame her. Everyone does stupid things for love.

As I got to know Jamie I was odd things about him I didn't like. He seemed to stare too hard, and his gaze would linger. 

It made my skin crawl. His father was worse. I recall one incident at his parents home, that makes me both sick and proud of my younger self for trusting my instincts. 

We had gone to visit one afternoon, and my mom sat in the dining room drinking coffee with Jamie's mom, discussing random things.

I was tired, and slightly crabby that day. I was nearing womanhood, and my mood swings were wild. And I was a vicious girl.

I got up from the recliner to get a drink of water, and Jamie's dad had reached out as I walked by, to ""tickle"" me. 

I swatted his hand away and went to the kitchen. His gaze bore into my back. 

As I walked by again, he grabbed me again, causing me to spill my water on the rug.

 And what I mean by grab, is he slung his arm around my waist, and tried to pull me onto his lap to ""tickle"".

I was furious. I wasn't a touchy feely child, I had boundaries. I snapped.

I spun on him, with Jamie watching, mildly amused. He would soon regret that, because his amusement made me angrier.

"" Don't touch me."" I sad flatly, my fury making me shake. I went to the kitchen again to grab a towel. 

My mom saw the look on my face and asked me what was wrong. I explained. She frowned at my brief story, and followed me out of the kitchen. 

Once again, as I walked by, his father tried to ""tickle"" me again and I went ballistic. 

"" DON'T FUCKING TOUCH ME!"" I screamed, turning on him, "" I'LL BREAK YOUR FUCKING FINGERS! DON'T.TOUCH.ME.AGAIN."" 

Jamie rose from the couch to ""punish me"" for yelling at his father. Big mistake.

My mom was not mad at me for defending myself. Even if I cursed.

She rounded on Jamie, ex-CO(correctional officer) instinct kicking in.

""Jamie, she had every right to voice her opinion. You will not punish her for defending herself. She warned him once. And I'll be damned if you think you're allowed to hit my kids."" 

He looked genuinely shocked. I think it was absurd of him to think that only being with my mom for a short time allowed him to hit us when he deemed fit. 

He was wrong. So very wrong. My mom was the only one who was ever allowed to punish us, and she didn't often have to get physical. 

""She should at least apologize. She yelled at him in his own house.""

Another mistake. I came nose to nose with Jamie, and boldly said,

""Fuck off, I will not apologize to a pervert."" and walked out of the house.

I went home, and seethed.  The event was soon forgotten about. 

I didn't have a lot of friends during that age. I was shy, and awkward. I preferred books to people. 

The one living creature that really heard my actual opinion was Reggie.

She understood me. At least I thought she did. 

A couple months after the event in question, was my mom's wedding. She wasn't happy, I could tell, but everyone she knew pressured her into the marriage, and she stupidly listened. 

We( meaning myself, my sisters, and my mom) were late to the wedding. And mom was slightly drunk. She was not smiling in one of those photos from the wedding. 

We continued to live in the apartment at the back of the cafe, save for I no longer slept in the same bed as mom. She bought me a twin bed. 

My unease towards Jamie and his father never stopped. I never let him see me in so much as a towel. The thought of him seeing me nude made me ill. I kept all my personal items far away from him. And tried to stay out of his sight as much as possible, unless I was working, then I just tolerated him.

I soon met Chrissy, who was two years younger than me at 11. She was my first friend in Kooskia, and we soon grew to be inseperable. I spent the night at her place, trying to keep her away from mine. 

My mom soon came out of her depressed and desperate phase, and wasn't pleased with Jamie in the least. They fought often, so we stayed out from underfoot. 

Her mother Doris, had recently lost her husband Charles, and was living with her father until she could get back on her feet. I liked her father, he was a nice man, and Doris was decent. She had some slight bipolar and depression issues, but she was nice enough. 

My mom soon heard of her plight and need for money, and gave her a job as a Dish-washer in our cafe. Things were well and quiet. We hired another girl, who was a timid Mormon girl with six kids to support. 

She worked for us for two weeks, while my mom was on a trip. My mom's foster mother Loki, was sick, and she took a trip to Arizona to take care of her. During that time I was back in Grangeville staying with my sisters father. 

We came back, and Jamie informed us that she'd quit. We found it odd that she'd quit and pushed on continuing with the rest of the evening in peace. Until my mom discovered a note in her office drawer, from this woman. 

All it said was "" I'm sorry, but I must leave. I can't tell you why, but stay away from Jamie. He's a very bad person. I do not trust him around myself or your children."" with her signature. It was a troublesome note and my mom confronted Jamie about it. 

He denied any knowledge of what the woman was talking about. My mom told him to leave her sight, and wanted a divorce. They'd been married for only 3 months. He left, and the divorce procedure kicked in.

To our absolute horror, we discovered he'd cleared out my mothers business bank account, leaving us with no way to make the restaraunt payment that month. He'd also demanded ownership of our business in the divorce papers. 

Rather than let him do this, decided to sell the place. It was heart-breaking to my mom. And us. But we couldn't stand seeing it go to that man. And soon someone else bought it, and we were moving out.

Then, a shocking truth came out. Jamie had been cheating on my mother with Doris. The entire time she was employed with us. Mom couldn't take anymore, and we moved away. We wanted nothing else to do with him any longer. 

About a year later, we were shocked to find an article in the morning paper. I cannot find that article, but this is as close as I could find:

http://www.klewtv.com/news/10510562.html 

He had moved in with Doris and Chrissy. They'd married. And shortly after this...he'd gotten ahold of Chrissy. He was molesting and sexually abusing her while Doris was completely unaware. He'd only been caught when Chrissy invited over a friend to stay, and he'd bought them wine coolers. He got them drunk, and made them dress up in lingerie, and dance for him. The girl went home, and immediately reported this to her parents. 

Her parents called the police. 

I'm sickened that I lived in the same home as this man, that he was around myself and my sisters. He never touched us, but I think if my mother wasn't as smart as she is, he would have. He believed that marrying a busy single mother would be prime opportunity to abuse her teenage daughters. He was very wrong, and he got out quick. 

I knew something was wrong when our dog didn't trust him, after 4 months of being around him. I remember her insisting on sleeping in us girls' beds. She was protecting us. She knew something was wrong with him. 

Once again she saved us. "	t5_2t3t8	True

My husband was out of town for work so it was just the kids and I at home. I was in bed reading Reddit on my phone (this reddit not a good idea when you are naturally jumpy to begin with and an even worse idea when you are jumpy and home alone). I heard some noises outside, thinking it was the neighbor's dogs I brushed it off and continuted giving myself goosebumps. All of a sudden a noise came from by my window it sounded like someone was moving stuff around in the box of my truck! I grab my phone, my machete and a flashlight and proceed outside. I was greeted by my neighbor's dogs who had their hackles up and were emmiting a low growl. I walked down my steps, turned on my flashlight and looked around.

I call out "" whoever is out there come out, I AM armed and I have two dogs trained to fetch people"" Blackie and Fortune took off towards the tree line between mine and my neighbours house and started barking and growling. A kid of maybe 18 came out, took one look at me and stopped dead in his tracks. I asked him what he was doing on my property and he replied, "" I was dared to come steal something from your yard"" That raised warning bells in my head because no one would be that forthcoming... they would try to lie at first at least. I told him that my husband and I don't take kindly to people trying to steal from us and escorted him off my property. He took off running towards a car a little ways down the road and jumped in.

Now this is where it gets really scary. 2 weeks after this incident (a police report was filed AFTER the fact because of my machete) I noticed that the flipper for the BBQ was laying on the ground and I asked my oldest son to pick it up and take it in so I could wash it. He did as he was told and then informed me that he found a knife. I asked where and he led me to the treeline where the would be robber was hiding and pulled out a HUGE butcher knife! I went white and grabbed it by the tip of the blade and put it into a ziplock bag. I called my husband to tell him what I had found and he said to keep it in a safe place until he got home and then we would take it to the police station and turn it in.

Thanks to the finger prints and my description the kid has been caught but only a trespassing charge was laid against him since he didn't steal anything, break into my house or hurt anyone.

Looking back and realizing now the danger I was in as well as my boys I should have just called the cops and let them deal with it.

1375303358.0	1jg2q2	The Library Creeper	Mr_Stink_Finger	154	22	13	"Apologies for the length and any grammatical errors.


When I was a kid, I used to ride my bike almost daily to the local library branch a few blocks from my home.



One day when I was about 8, I rode down to the library like I normally did, parked my bike by the bike rack near the back entrance to the building, went in and browsed for whatever an 8-year-old boy would read, checked out a few books, and left the library. 


When I came out, there was a man standing over by the bike rack. I didn't think anything of it, so I went over to get my bike so I could go home. As I went to get on my bike, he said, ""Hi, my name is John."" Then, he asked me, ""What is your name?"" I was a stupid kid, so I said, ""_____."" He said, ""I work with your mom, you know."" ""What is her name again?"" So I said, (again, stupid kid here) ""_____."" He said, ""Oh, she wanted me to show you something in the woods.""


In hindsight, and upon many years of reflection upon this incident, the guy sounds like the most inept kidnapper/pedophile in history. It's like he was reading from the script of ""How not to Abduct a Child."" However, it was 35 years ago, and the most education kids got about this kind of thing was, ""Don't talk to strangers."" My parents were great, but this was just not something people worried about all that much. The abductions of Etan Patz and Adam Walsh definitely did a lot to change the perception, but that is an entirely different subject.


Anyway, I was a bit creeped out when he said that my mom wanted him to ""show me something in the woods,"" and my ""This is weird"" radar went up. I politely declined the invitation to the woods and hopped on my bike to pedal home. As I turned away, he grabbed the bar on the rear of my seat (it was a Schwinn 5-speed with a banana seat. Not sure what you call the bar) to keep me from peddling away.


Now I was scared. I jumped off the back and re-entered the library. I made my way to the circulation desk and asked if I could use the phone. The woman at the desk told me that the phone was not for public use, so I left the library again from the back entrance (the front was always locked).


Happily, my bike was still there and the creep was gone. Thinking nothing of it, I jumped on my bike and set off. About a block from the library, I noticed a brown car at a stop sign on a side street. I looked again, and I saw the creep behind the wheel. I realized many years later (and not at the time) that he knew my route home, which means he must have followed me from my house to the library. Whenever I think of this now, it gives me a sick feeling knowing that he could have taken me any time he wanted on my way to the library. I was probably saved by something as random someone walking a dog or grabbing their mail, and he didn't want any witnesses.


I pedaled faster once I spotted him, and he pulled out onto the main road (I was on the sidewalk) and followed me closely. When my bike sped up, he sped up, all the while screaming and pointing at me. By now, I was screaming, too, and moving pretty quickly for an 8-year-old on a 5-speed carrying library books. (No; I never thought to drop the damn books.)


I quickly turned onto a side street, and he was moving too fast to make the turn as well, and I saw him turn onto the next side street. The side street I turned on led to my street, but there was a hill that I could not yet pedal up between my street and I. I got about midway up the hill when I had to get off and walk my bike. He was parked at the very top of the hill, just staring at me.


I literally walked right past him, and I will never forget his stare or the hate in his eyes. I have no idea why he let me walk past him, why he didn't grab me, why he didn't kill me. 


I got to the top of the hill, got back on the bike and pumped my legs to get home. At this point, my house was less than 500 feet away. He turned his car around and followed me again. I got to my house, dropped my bike and screamed for my grandmother (she watched me while my parents worked.)


The creep sped past my house and turned down the next side street. I never saw him again. My parents called the police, and I remember answering the policeman's questions while I was standing on a chair, as I was too small to look the cop in the eye. I remember that the creep drove a Plymouth Duster-type car, that he was balding and about 25-30.

I don't know if he was ever caught, or if he ever hurt any children, his name or anything. All I know is that I have never gone back to a library (sounds silly, but true), and for the next few years I walked and rode my bike constantly looking over my shoulder, and that I am unbelievably protective of my children.

I don't trust anyone easily, I don't trust anyone with my children, and my first reaction to a helpful teacher, coach, etc., is, ""What is his or her motive or true intention?"" 

Not a day goes by that I don't think about that day, and I wonder not ""Why me?"" but ""Why not me?"""	t5_2t3t8	True
1374059907.0	1ih9h2	Downtown creeper tries to hurt my little sister	meow_mix8	158	27	17	"Hello all. First post here, I hope you enjoy. This definitely gave me and my little sister a scare, and I still think about it today and shudder.

This story takes place in 2007, I was 17, my little sister was 14. Our parents sent us to an acting/modeling agency then. Not actually to pursue a career in that, but more to help us by taking acting classes to develop poise and good public speaking skills. This agency had it's headquarters in downtown Seattle, WA. They had a dress code and basically every class we went to we had to be dressed as professionally as possible. Our family didn't have too much money then, but the outfits we wore made us look wealthy (thank you mom and dad!)

Anyway, one day my sister and I are going to acting class, but we're walking a few blocks because I couldn't find close parking. It was broad daylight, but so many people were around that it would be easy to lose someone int he crowd. 

We are waiting at a crosswalk. We are pretty close to a dark alley, and a hobo came up to us from the alley, probably because we looked like we could spare a few dollars, and asked for some money. He seemed pretty nice, but we had to tell him we didn't have any money (I had spent the last of it on parking). He said ""oh well, that's ok!"" and smiled.

My little sister was closer to the alley than I was and I was closer to the street. I turned back around to face the street, thinking the hobo had gone to ask someone else for change because there were TONS of people (big festival going on).

So what happened was that right when I turned around, the hobo turned to my little sister who was still facing him. He immediately dropped the smile and got really close to her. His eyes were a very cold light blue, and she said later that ""he had the coldest, most dead eyes I have ever seen in my life. It was like there was no soul behind them. He looked as detached and threatening as a murderer.""

The guy reaches into his inner coat pocket and starts pulling something out. My little sister sees a flash of silver and then realized it was a knife. Now right when the guy looked into her eyes with that dead expression, she was rendered speechless. Which is strange because she is a fiery redhead that is anything BUT speechless any other time. But his gaze alone struck a silencing fear on her. The instant she saw the knife, she realized he was probably going to hold it to her side (hidden from other people) and threaten her into the alleyway. 

Now at this time, I was blissfully unaware of what was going on, and so was everyone else around us. There were just too many people to notice something hidden like that. And I really don't claim at all to have a ""sixth sense"" or anything, but I do have a pretty good ""sketchy"" radar. I thought the hobo was really nice, so I thought we were safe. But for whatever reason as I'm facing towards the street, I get this horrible awful sinking feeling in me. I felt scared. Everything just felt wrong. I had this strong unexplainable urge to look towards my sister, and I turn around. I see the hobo still there, hunched eye level to eye level (she's only 5'1""), and holding something towards her. I didn't know it was a knife but it looked like he was going to hurt or grab her. I felt my eyes grow huge and I say loudly and very sternly ""WHAT ARE YOU-..."" As soon as I said that, he snapped his face at me, and turned and ran down the alley.

Part of me was now realizing what just happened. I look at my sister and she is white as a ghost (even super white for a redhead). She looks like she's about to cry, and I rush her to the other side of the street away from the alley. Once we are safe, I get her to tell me what happened. I was so angry and scared at the same time. I'm glad it only took a few words to get him to run.

To this day, I still do not want to know what that man had in store for my sister. And i have no idea what he thought he would do if she started screaming. Maybe he thought if he told her ""if you scream I'll stab you, now go in the alley"" or something she'd comply. I am so thankful for the creeper radar that told me to turn around just in time. After that, I made sure that we left early for class so we get the closest parking spot available, and never to let my eyes off my sister downtown again.

EDIT: also wanted to say the worst part was that the crosswalk turned to ""walk"" pretty soon after I turned around. If I hadn't turned around I would have crossed the street without her."	t5_2t3t8	True
1372875654.0	1hkyok	Hiding under the bed, you say?	CrazyBoxLady	146	12	24	"I've never submitted here before, but I just visited my family and my aunt told me this story for the first time. I knew you guys would want to hear it.

When my aunt was in high school, she was a knockout.  She was very popular, homecoming queen, was in beauty pageants, etc, etc. As a very attractive young woman, she got hit on constantly, and had older men make inappropriate comments on the regular.

One day, standing in line at the grocery store with her mom, the man in line behind them started talking to her and asking her questions.  My grandmother was checking out, and not really paying attention to her 16-year-old daughter, assuming she could take care of herself in a crowded grocery store in the middle of the day.  Anyway, he starts asking her how old she is, and is that her mom, what are they making for dinner tonight, does she have any sisters as pretty as her, the usual creeper fare. Eventually, my grandmother notices him talking to her and tells him they have to leave now, have a nice day. 

Just as my aunt and grandmother are loading groceries into their car, the man walks up to their car and tells my grandmother that my aunt should be a model, and that she should keep an eye on her because boys that age only want one thing. My grandmother told my aunt to get in the car and then told the man if he spoke to them again, she would call the security guard over. He angrily walked away mumbling about how he didn't mean any harm, glaring at my aunt (sitting in the car) the whole time.  They drove home and didn't think anything of it.

That encounter was weird, but not nearly as bad as what happened later. I should mention at this point that my grandmother lived with my three aunts, just the four of them in a 4-bedroom house.  

After going to bed that night, my aunt woke up and felt a cold breeze coming in through her window. She didn't remember opening her window before bed, and thought she would get up to close it. Then she felt something move on her bed. She didn't move because she was certain that it was a hand. She felt someone reaching under her covers and touching her. The way her room was situated, the person was laying on the floor between her bed and her bedroom door.  If she were to try to run, she would have to get past the person first.

She just lay in her bed for a minute, terrified, trying to think of what to do.  Then she heard him talking to himself and breathing heavily as he tried to touch her underneath her clothes. She's fairly sure he was masturbating as he touched her, because she could hear something that ""sounded wet."" Overtaken by fear and adrenaline, she screamed and jumped out of bed, hurtling herself over the mystery intruder and into the hallway.  My grandmother woke up and came running into the hall and my aunt told her what had happened.  They checked her bedroom, but the intruder had left out the window. 

Also, my aunt's bedroom was on the second floor. The intruder had been in such a hurry to get away that he left his ladder behind, along with polaroids of my aunt that had been taken at the grocery store, at her house, and in her backyard. The photos were on the floor all around her bed where the man had been laying. 

My grandmother called her neighbor who came over with his shotgun to sit on their porch all night.  The guy was never caught, but thankfully my aunt never saw him again, and they got a free ladder.  

Moral of the story: DON'T TALK TO ANYONE EVER, AND NEVER LEAVE THE HOUSE.

1367108361.0	1d8u7l	Sleeping Beauty	emlabb	156	27	16	"I'm a girl in my mid-twenties. A few months ago my brother and I were both in the hospital, a room apart from each other.

One night I wake up and hear something going on in the hallway. I can't see very far out the door, but I hear a woman's voice saying ""Ohhhh, Sleeping Beauty,"" accompanied by the familiar sound of feet shuffling down the hallway. I find this a little strange, but don't think much more about it and I fall back asleep. 

The next day I visit my brother in his room and he starts telling our parents a story. 

The night before, he woke up too. He woke up to the sound of a woman's voice saying, ""Ohhh, Sleeping Beauty! Such a lovely Sleeping Beauty... ohhh, ohhh, so pretty, you look just like Sleeping Beauty."" The voice continues to murmur about ""sleeping beauty"" for what seems to be a long time. 

The voice is coming from my room. 

Then a woman appears in his doorway. Very slowly, she shuffles across the room towards his bed. 

My brother is hooked up to two IVs, one in each arm. He also has a fresh set of stitches across his abdomen. He can't go anywhere. 

The woman is very close now. She's wearing a headscarf. He can't see her face well. He tries to remain calm and asks, ""Can I help you?""

She doesn't answer. She's by his bedside now. Then she lunges.

She lunges past his head and begins pawing at the package of compression socks on the table behind him. She scratches at the plastic, over and over, as if she likes the sound it makes. 

Then a nurse comes in and gently leads the woman away. ""This isn't your room, honey,"" the nurse says. ""Let's go back to your room, okay?""


I am so glad I did not wake up any earlier than I did that night.

The best/worst part is that although my brother was discharged a day or two later, I was there for another week. Every night I wondered if I would wake up to find her hovering over me again, cooing over what a lovely Sleeping Beauty I was...

1362658813.0	19uaxg	[Possible Trigger?] A substitute teacher I had in 5th grade turned out to be a pedophile.	wrongaboutus	161	30	52	"I moved to Loveland, CO with my family when I was 9ish years old. Loveland is not a big city, but it’s not a small town either. We lived in a nice house just on the outskirts of town, so my little sister and I attended Big Thompson Elementary School since it was nearby. It’d be fair to say that all of the students at Big T lived out in the “boonies” and were what you might consider to be more country type kids. When I was in 5th grade, my class couldn’t have had more than 35 kids in it, and we were split into two classes so our teachers’ jobs were more manageable. To add some more information, it was probably 2002-2003ish when I was in 5th grade, and I’m a girl, which will be relevant later.

Big T had two playgrounds – upper and lower. [The lower or main playground is visible from County Road 27.](http://i.imgur.com/ActKZ5s.jpg?2) and has your standard jungle gym equipment, most of which is pretty old. [As you can see from this aerial shot](http://i.imgur.com/w0e5DWj.jpg?2), the upper playground is mostly dirt and pea gravel. When it was nice outside, which it usually is in Northern Colorado, we’d oftentimes have our gym classes there so we had lots of room to run, play kickball, or to trip and fall and get sand and small rocks embedded into our skin. I still have scars on my knees. 

Now that you know Big T, here’s my story.

I believe my peers and I had finished up with our music class (i.e., recorder pandemonium) and were headed up to gym class. It was nice outside, and we were instructed to go to the upper playground. As kids do, we were all laughing and talking to our best friends. We started walking up the stairs (I’ll add the diagram in a moment here) and at the top waiting for us was a man who introduced himself as our substitute gym teacher for the day, since the regular teacher was away.

Do you ever get *feelings* about people, good or bad? These are not necessarily related to anything the person does or says, it’s just something about them that you can’t really explain. You feel like you know them on some deeper level, for some reason. My mom is really spot on with her feelings, especially the negative ones. She’s warned me about someone I shouldn’t hang out with because of a bad feeling, and then sure as shit, that person ends up doing something that usually ends with me getting my feelings hurt. 

Anyway, when I saw this sub from a distance, he immediately struck me as odd. He was wearing these tapered leg 90’s looking dad jeans, old gym shoes, glasses like Napoleon Dynamite’s, and semi-long dark coat that was probably mid-thigh length or longer. It was weird because it was warm outside, and any gym teacher I’d seen before always wore exercise clothes!

However, when I got closer to him, I felt like something was not just weird about him, but _wrong._ My gut knotted up, my heart started pounding out of my chest, and as his eyes met mine, I felt like a deer in someone’s crosshairs. I wanted to run away, but I couldn’t. No one else seemed to look nervous, so I tried to brush it off. 

It’s been easily 10 years since this happened, so I don’t remember all of the in-between details, but I think after he took attendance, he told us to run a few laps like normal. [Here is a little diagram of the upper playground, and where he was in respect to where we were running.](http://i.imgur.com/ENlDofY.jpg?2)

Once we started jogging, I began to feel better the further I was away from him. Unfortunately, we were running in an oval so when I was getting closer again, the bad gut feeling returned and got exponentially worse with every nearing step I took. This continued the entire time we were running.

I don’t really remember what we were doing in class that day. I think everyone was doing different things in their own little groups. Some girls were playing catch with a softball, most of the boys were playing with the football, some of us were playing kickball, etc. so we were spread out all over the field. I was just trying to stay as far away from this guy as possible, and I expressed that concern to my best friend. Of course though, she just _had_ to go to the bathroom and required my company and forced me to go ask the sub with her. 

I was terrified as we were approaching this guy, and he looked excited that we were coming up to him IIRC. My friend didn’t seem to feel what I was feeling, so she didn’t understand. The sub started talking to my friend a bit, but I wouldn’t talk to him. As we were standing by him, several times he took a small step towards me with his creepy smile and his hand in his coat pocket. I would step back every time because the hell if I’m going to be within an arm’s length of someone who’s giving me such an awful feeling. He noticed that my friend wasn’t shying away from him like I was, so he took a step towards her so he was standing mostly next to her, but also slightly behind her if that makes sense, and put his arm over her shoulder. I don’t remember any of the dialogue because all I could think about was that his hand was not just on her shoulder anymore. It was slowly inching down towards her chest. I felt so helpless to what was happening. I felt like all I could do was watch in mute horror as this man tried to fondle my best friend. 

She and I made eye contact, and my fear was mirrored perfectly on her face. Her eyes were welling up, and she said something about going to the bathroom now. We walked off into the far corner of the basketball court and the sub didn’t notice. She started crying, and between sobs I was able to gather that she “felt something hard” when he was standing kind of behind her. 

I tried to comfort her, but I was completely clueless. We were watching him walk towards another one of our classmates who was playing softball with her friends. I guess they’d accidentally thrown the ball over the back fence, and she was asking him if she could go retrieve it. He put his arm around her but still had the other hand in his pocket, like he did my friend, but she immediately threw his arm off of her and yelled, “GET OFF OF ME!” 

I honestly can’t remember the rest of gym class that day. My friend and I were hiding by the trees and bushes in the corner of the basketball court until the bell rang. 

I do remember that right before class started, one of my peers with whom I normally didn’t speak approached my best friend, and me and asked if the sub did anything to us. She nodded yes, and the girl brought us over to the main group of girls. All of us – all the girls in the 5th grade – started talking about what to do. We felt comfortable with the female teacher and felt like we could trust her, so those of us who were in the male teacher’s class asked to go over to Mrs. Teacher’s room because we needed to tell her something personal.

We all told her what happened, and the few of us that hadn’t been touched just confirmed what we saw. 

She said she’d take care of us.

When I got home, I found my dad and told him that we had a creepy teacher and I relayed some of what I saw. I guess I started off the wrong way because he immediately turned pale and yelled at me to tell him if the man touched me. I said no. He said, “Oh thank god. I really didn’t want to go to jail right now.” I didn’t really understand how protective a man is of his daughter until I was well into my teens, and my dad described in great detail what he would do to any man or boy who abused me in any way. Looking bad, I know for a fact that if my answer had been yes, my dad would’ve grabbed that .45 off the top of the fridge, loaded his kill-me-a-bear rounds into it, and hunted that sub teacher down, at that moment, consequences be damned. 

A while later (maybe weeks or months), my parents approached me and asked if I wanted to testify in court against the sub. They said I didn’t need to since they had a lot of other witnesses and victims, but that I could if I wanted to and that it wouldn’t hurt. I think he fondled some of the girls in 4th grade too, but I could be wrong. I said no because I was too afraid of seeing him again, even though he didn’t physically touch me. I regret that sometimes, but IIRC he got a pretty harsh sentence and is probably going to die in prison. Again, I could be wrong because this was 10 years ago, but I believe that he had previously been charged with some creepy pedophile shit and the school didn't do a background check on him before letting him sub. I don't know if any lawsuits ensued. Maybe I'm making things up. I barely remember, but my parents said I was afraid to leave the house because I thought I’d see him and he’d hurt me for telling on him, something like that.

I’m sorry this is so long and rambling. I can’t remember the guy’s name for the life of me. I’ve spent quite a bit of time trying to find any article about it, but I can’t seem to dig up any info about police reports or the case. You all are welcome to look if you’d like. I’ll happily provide more information if you need any. 

**Long TL;DR – When I was in 5th grade, we had a substitute gym teacher who ended up fondling many of the girls in my class. Before it happened, I had a really strong, negative gut feeling and I felt like I was being preyed on. It was pretty creepy. I’m thankful for the good instincts I have and I’m glad I avoided him, but I hope all of those girls in my class haven’t suffered any lasting damage. We all told my teacher what happened, and I assume she called the police and reported it and called parents. I can’t find any articles, but IIRC, the man received a harsh sentence. Will provide more information if anyone is interested in finding articles online.**"	t5_2t3t8	True

It was a pretty open neighborhood in a decent but not great part of town. One day, I was home from school and the doorbell rang. A tall, disheveled looking man, maybe like late 30s/early 40s was at the door. He said hello and that his car had broken down and he needed to use the telephone. I told him I was sorry, but unfortunately I couldn't help, I just didnt feel comfortable with letting him inside. He shrugged his shoulders and walked down the street. As I watched out the window, the guy gets into his car and drives right past the house, looking in my general direction (he couldn't see me behind the blinds). But the fact that his car was fine sent shivers down my spine. What would have happened had he gotten in? I don't know. Eesh.	t5_2t3t8	True

I used to travel around country going to certain festivals and concerts. My girlfriend and I at the time had been on the road for probably about two weeks when we picked up this kid Eric in Arizona. He seemed like a good kid and we had loads of fun in Vegas, riding almost all the rollercoasters and rides in town.....lucky for you, this story doesn't happen in Vegas.

So after a rainy, Long Shitty Drive we checked in to nice hotel in San Francisco. We split a room with a buddy of mine and his smokin hot GF. so that meant 5 people in the room, 2 couples and 5th wheel Eric. We were hanging out in the room just having fun and getting wasted, when Eric starts mumbling something and tells everyone he is gonna take a bath. 

O.k. So about 15 minutes later I am hearing a lot of splashing going on and everyone is laughing because it sounded pretty loud. Another 5 minutes goes by and we start to hear really loud banging......and more splashing.....and when i  asked if he was ok, he just mumbled at me. And about two minutes after that..even louder splashing and banging. We are all sitting on the bed just looking at each other like WTF. Then in perfectly clear english he starts praising all the saints....really loud. Like oh praise John, oh praise Luke Oh praise Mathew and after about 20 seconds he gets to Timothy.......""Oh prraaaaaaaaaiiiiiisse Timothy""

Now there is actually water coming under the door. Everybody is looking at me like, Do something!
So i open the door and he is jerking his thing and throwing water everywhere, and I notice the tub water had large terds floating all in it. so i slam the door and at this point we are fucking flippin out. My buddy had warrants and was trying to figure out what to do. I look back to the bathroom and water is just pouring out and making it's way into the hall. It was the trippiest looking puddle of water up against that crazy patterned hotel carpet. I think just knowing it was shit water. Holy Shit Water.

We bailed.....jumped in the car but then realised his back pack was in the car and i couldn't leave him with nothing. I ran his back pack up to the floor we were on, looked around the corner and saw hotel staff sorounding his naked self in the hall. I just chucked his backpack around the corner and bolted out of San Fran as fast as possible....found out later they sent him to a mental hospital but we never saw him again.

1347872948.0	100k4y	road trip story, west texas. near miss.	resonanteye	150	20	51	"UPDATE: I called the sheriff dept in the county where I *think* this was at. They said they didn't have records on hand, and it was a new dispatcher/phone person I talked to, but they said they will see if they can find out and call me back.

So depending on whether they call me back or not, I might find out what was actually going on there that night.

story:

I was on a cross-country road trip, with a colleague. We were driving through west texas, on a major highway. In the area where we were, even the major highway was pretty desolate. There had been a truck stop or gas station about every hundred miles, and every one of them was solitary with no other buildings in sight.

These weren't really towns, the exits, just places to get more gas to get to the next gas station.

It was pretty late at night, and she had been driving for like four hours. I usually can drive for about eight before I'm tired out (I go on frequent road trips) but she could only manage four or five before it was ""my turn"" again. We were also getting low on gas, at about a quarter tank, and you learn from road travel to fill up when you get the chance. So she was looking for a gas station as we drove along. 

It's really corny but we were talking about fate, and destiny, and some other weird shit at the time. That kind of conversation gets me keyed up and worried, so I was trying to change the subject. She took an exit  while we were talking, and I got out my coffee mug so I could fill up for my turn driving. We pulled into a typical nowhereville gas station- just the station and a trailer out back (I assume thinking back it was probably where the people who owned it lived). There was another car parked in front of the doors off to one side.

We got out, still talking, and walked up to the double doors, each of us grabbing a door handle. 

The doors were locked. I turned and looked around to see if there was a sign (sometimes places will put up a ""back in 5 minutes"") and noticed several things in succession; the coffeemaker in side was half-way done brewing a fresh pot of coffee, the monitors that showed the store were visible from outside, where we were, but all of them were showing static, and there was a splash of bright red on the door in the back of the place, which was closed. I suddenly realized I was looking at a huge streak of blood, with handprints in it.

Every hair on my neck stood up. My friend began shaking the door, yelling ""WE NEED TO GET GAS"" but I had already turned and walked away from the doors.

""We have to LEAVE. NOW"" I grabbed her arm and started propelling her back to the car. Now I noticed the other car in the lot. It had no plates. It was dingy and had dents. There was an empty gun rack in the window of it. I ran to the car, dragging her with me. She seemed to take forever to open her door and get in (she had the keys still)

The whole time she kept saying, but we need gas! while I tried to explain to her, ""there's BLOOD in there. BLOOD.""

after what seemed like a year she pulled the car out. when we were backing up, I saw through the windows that the back door in the gas station was opening. We had pulled away before anyone came out, thankfully.

I freaked out until we were twenty miles down the highway. I tried to call police but had no signal, I didn't get a phone signal until we had driven about forty miles and got to a truck stop. again, not in a town, just a building on its own in the middle of nothingness.

I called the cops, they thanked me, and I never heard anything more about it. To this day I feel like if I hadn't freaked out, we probably would have met the robber- or whoever was in the back room of the place.

I also wish I had been able to find out what the hell had happened there. It was a Chevron station, somewhere in the western part of TX (at least, within about a hundred miles or so of the signs for those places, on RT 10)

1345895965.0	yswyx	Mr. NoPants and the Lemonade Stand	binnska	149	18	20	"Not gonna lie, it makes me a little sad that this is the subreddit where I have the most stories to share. I think I might be a lunatic magnet. Anyway!

When I was 10, I lived in a five building apartment complex in a very quiet town. The buildings were arranged in a horseshoe formation and I lived in the first building. My friend Erica lived in a house across the street from the complex. She was one of the only other girls my age in the area, so we played together a lot.

One day during summer vacation, we decided we would have a lemonade stand as kids are wont to do. All day we sold lemonade and kool-aid to neighborhood kids, our parents, and the occasional nice person on a bike or out for a walk. It was going great and we had actually made about $10 each, which was a huge deal to 10 year olds!

Around 4pm we were getting bored and decided to start packing up. That's when a man in a pickup pulled up to our stand and asked how much for lemonade. We told him 50¢ or whatever we were charging and he said he had to go home and get money, but he'd be back to buy a whole bunch if we could just wait a few minutes more. We were stoked and readily agreed to wait. Present me looks back on this and cringes, because I definitely heard warning bells in my head. But...but...money! So we hung out.

Ten minutes later he came back, and drove into the oval from the far entrance, so that when he came back around the passenger side of the car was closest to us. Again, warning bells, but again, greedy. He yelled out to us to bring him the lemonade, and to pass it through the passenger side window. 

Erica and I lined up next to the car and she reached in to pass him his cup. She immediately froze, her hand halfway across the passenger seat, as we saw that he wasn't wearing pants and was VERY happy to see us. 

In that moment, he grabbed her arm and we both started screaming bloody murder. I used the trick my mom taught me for if I ever got lost in a family-heavy neighborhood and yelled ""MOMMY!"" at the top of my lungs. 20 women immediately appeared at windows all across the complex, and Mister NoPants screeched out of there so fast he almost ran over our feet.

Our parents called the police and it turned out several attempts on other girls our age in the area over the previous few weeks had been made by someone matching our description and his truck's description. Our police sketch of him was in the local newspaper, but as far as I know it never came to anything. 

It was terrifying, but we were both okay. I seriously hope he didn't succeed in grabbing some other girl, and I'm incredibly grateful that so many people immediately responded to a generic call for mommy."	t5_2t3t8	True
1327886929.0	p2cvo	A Quick Reaction...	Dijamant	146	16	20	"When I was around 8 or 9, I was left at home , all alone, playing some game on the computer upstairs. My parents were out eating dinner and my older brother was out with some friends. It was around 10pm when I heard a rough knock. I automatically assumed that it was my brother because he usually came home around that time, so I went downstairs to open the door for him. This is where it gets creepy real fast... Usually, I would unlock it quickly and sprint back upstairs to get back to what I was doing; I wouldn't even check the peephole because I knew when someone was supposed to come home. However, this time I had a strange feeling, and I don't know how to explain it, call it a 6th sense. For some reason as soon as I unlocked the door, something came over me telling me to lock it, and I IMMEDIATELY did. As soon as the person heard the clicks of the door, he started tackling the door. Now remember, I was 8-9 so I was unbelievable scared. The person kept tackling the door, and they were FULL ON BODY tackles. I could see the door moving and creaking as if it was about to break. I ran back to the kitchen to get a knife and I hid in the corner waiting for the door to break. I was panicking so I didn't know what to do at this point. Realistically, I should have called the cops right away but I decided to handle it on my own (dumb). I was considering escaping and ditching the house by jumping the fences through my backyard, but I figured that they were waiting for me there.

This had gone on for a good 5 minutes and it eventually stopped. I figured it was all over and I was safe. I checked the peephole, no one was there. Another 5 minutes pass and I assume it was all over. Turns out, these people decided to sneak their car beside my house where I could not see (since there were no windows on this side) and waited there. I barely heard the sound of the car but I knew they were there. All of a sudden, the tackling comes back, it was even worse this time. I pick up my phone, call my parents, brother and the cops and hide in the basement. Whoever it was, they left because as soon my brother arrived, he saw that no one was there and noticed that there was a bunch of rotten food whipped at the house and that everything in the backyard was stolen (toys and anything valuable. The cops said they would investigate but nothing happened. To this day, I wonder what would have happened to me if I didn't lock that door within milliseconds, would I still be here today? Whatever came over me that night had perhaps saved my life!

1375825852.0	1ju9lk	"""I'll fucking kill you, kid"""	GreeneMachine1	168	39	25	"This is my first time posting here. I've always read these stories and never thought I would have something worth posting, so here goes. I'm a long winded individual so bear with me.

I live in Calgary and was on my way home from a job interview today when this happened (it went great, fingers crossed!). I left the building and immediately went to the nearest stop for the train. Now, for those unaware, Calgary has a pretty sizable homeless population and it's not uncommon for them to ""ride the rails"" to seek refuge from weather or to just pass the time, so I'm used to dealing with these types of people. In fact, when I moved here I found it strange how these people were so friendly. Most of the homeless I've run into here were generally really nice people and never do the whole ""Got some spare change? no? fuck off"" and will often just strike up a conversation. 


So here I am, sitting on the train, when I notice this guy sitting across from me. I notice that he is flipping people the bird in a not-so-subtle way. Like, resting his hands on his lap flipping the bird. Now, at this point I'm not about to say anything, but he begins cursing and swearing randomly. There were children on the bus so I said something to the effect of ""hey man, there are kids on here"". Big mistake. Buddy turns and looks at me and does a throat slitting motion at me and says ""I'll fucking kill you, kid"" to the shock of everyone on the train. I'm no coward but I'm not about to argue with this obviously mentally unstable individual. Whatever. So I just sit back and watch the show. The guy continues the throat slitting motion, but now it was like some kind of nervous tick. He kept rubbing his face and then making the throat slitting motion at no one in particular and straight up blubbering gibberish. He got off the next stop and just fucking *smashed* one of the windows in the train with his hand and looks at me through the door and started spitting out obscenities and threats (I couldn't really hear him over the commotion of people exiting the train). At this point I was thinking ""fuck this guy, I'm never going to see him again. I will concede that I can be a smartass at times and what I did next may not have been the brightest move, but it felt great. 


So buddy is outside the train hollering and cursing and calling me a bitch, etc, so I got an idea. There's about a 10-15 second delay before the train departs after the doors lock. The doors lock and buddy is still going nuts so I just look at him through the window, flip him off and mouth the words ""Fuck you, douchebag"" Buddy goes *absolutely fucking bananas* and starts kicking the train while it's locked down and tried to keep pace as it started pulling out of the station.


Maybe a little atypical of the average story on here but I certainly hope this fellow and I do not meet again."	t5_2t3t8	True
1371436927.0	1ghnk8	He must've been there, watching, the entire time	evilpettingz00	180	49	21	"I've been a fan of this thread for awhile now. I love these stories! I don't believe in ghosts and all that happy horse shit so, for me, this is the kind of stuff that actually scares me, and I love it! Anyhoo, here's a creepy little encounter:


So, it was near high school graduation around 2004. My good friend's mom had rented a large picnic or barbeque space or whatever at the local forest preserve. The town was just outside a huge city, but we had chunks of forest preserves all over. Great places to tell scary stories about, or get fucked up in when you're too young to go to a bar, shit like that. Anyhoo, so it's the day of this huge graduation party. This guys one of my best friends so I'm there early with his family helping set up and shit (I'm also a dude btw.) 


So I was helping one of his uncles set up a keg and my buddy (Jeff, we'll say) runs off to where the little forest road meets the main road so he can put up signs that say ""Turn here for Jeff's great fucking party"" or whatever. Hes gone for an unnoticeable amount of time, but then he comes jogging back and I can tell something is really wrong.


He pulls me aside, obviously a bit shaken and proceeds to tell me about this dude he ran into out on the forest road. Apparently he was walking back and there was some normal looking older guy (maybe 30s) just walking along as well. He said it was weird though because the guy came out of nowhere. He would have had to literally come out of the bushes. He starts asking Jeff ""what's going on"", ""throwing a party?"" ""Oh nice."" Normal shit you'd expect a stranger who doesn't look like a rapist to say. Then suddenly he looks at Jeff and motions to the treeline and is like ""Hey. Wanna.... you know."" And Jeff is like ""Wanna fucking what??"" And the guy becomes a bit more aggressive and starts moving towards him and starts barking orders like ""C'mon lets get in the forest and fuck around."" So my buddy being the pussy connoisseur that he is, definitely does not want to fuck a dude in the forest. And even if he was gay, it would probably take a little more effort than ""lets jump in the bushes and I'll touch your dick"" or whatever. So Jeff just starts walking faster, but the dude's body movements are getting even more aggressive, he crosses to the same side of the road that Jeff is walking on, he keeps up with him and keeps insisting. Its clear that this guy isn't going to stop, and Jeff is getting the vibe that hes trying to psyche himself up for something (like tackling some poor teenager and going to town on his young butthole in the fucking brush) so he starts running. And the guy starts yelling ""Don't fucking run from me!"" And starts chasing him! But he disappears as quickly as he had shown up, and next thing ya know, Jeff is back safely and telling me this story. 


My first reaction, as a shit head teenager, is to immediately mock Jeff brutally for almost getting butt-raped in the forest. But hes clearly spooked and I had never seen him so weirded out before. I tell him to forget it and that we've got a shitload of underage drinking to get to. Fast forward to nighttime. The barbeque has become a bonfire. Jeff's mother and one or two cool uncles are still there, most other family members had come and gone, and now its mostly us kids and our friends. A handful of us, including Jeff, slip off to the treeline to smoke a little pot. 


(His mom was cool with us boozing, but we didn't know how she felt about drugs and we didn't care to find out.) So we creep over and step into the woods so we're nice and hidden, and BAM! We straight up stumble upon some dude just hanging out by the trees! We must've surprised him by being so sneaky because at first he was just staring at the rest of the party, soon as he saw us he almost jumped out of his skin (as did the rest of us) and he PULLED HIS PANTS UP and sprinted out into the forest. It was the creepiest goddamn thing. Jeff swears it was the same guy from earlier. This especially creeps me out because not only was there some very ballsy rapist just tra-la-la-ing through the forest preserve in the middle of a sunny day, but he must've been watching us the entire time and... jacking it? I guess. Ugh. 


Anyhoo, it freaked us all out and the party ended shortly after. I still shudder to think what could've happened had Jeff not been able to get away from the first encounter, or if one of us had wandered deep into the tree line alone to take a piss or something. But I am eternally grateful that, to this day, whenever I'm losing an argument with Jeff I can still bust out ""LEAST I DIDN'T ALMOST GET BUTTFUCKED IN THE FOREST PRESERVE YOU GODDAMN PUSSY!"""	t5_2t3t8	True
1363588670.0	1aifwn	He would disconnect my internet connection		164	32	30	"I would like to start off by stating that I am a 27 year old female.  I’ve had quite a few creepy experiences happen to me while growing up in my old neighborhood during the ‘90s and 2000s.  One time I was in the 8th grade, getting off the bus a block away from my home and an old man driving a beaten up Oldsmobile had tried to talk me into getting his car but I had managed to get away.  I remember another time when I was about 9 years old, hiding under the bed with my sister after gun shots went off at our neighbor’s house.  The cops came knocking shortly after, asking my mom for witness testimony.  I also remember a different situation while I was getting ready in the morning for high school.  I had heard the sound of something like rocks being thrown at the wall underneath my windowsill.  A couple days later the police had arrested a crazy old homeless lady who was wandering in our neighborhood from yard to yard, seeking shelter and food in peoples’ sheds (ours’ included).  Why she threw rocks near my window, I may never know.

However the scariest thing that has happened to me while living in my old neighborhood was about 7 years ago when I was a sophomore in college.  At that time, I was a huge computer addict.  I had just bought myself a new laptop as a reward from working crappy shifts at McDonald’s and I had recently upgraded to cable internet from dial-up as a gift from my dad.  I used my computer for everything, whether it be writing papers for school, maintaining a blog, chatting on yahoo messenger and posting on forums.  Even enjoying porn every so often (a girl has needs).  Typical college student stuff.  So I made full use of my laptop at this point in time, and I would be up late at night, sometimes until 2 or 3 in the morning.  

Well one night I was up late on my computer.  I was updating my blog when all of a sudden my internet connection was cut off.  I looked at my modem and I noticed that my “Sending” light was on but my “Receiving” light was off.  I figured something was wrong with the internet provider and assumed it would be fixed by tomorrow.  I was wrong.

The next day my internet was still down.  It didn’t make sense that the cable was sending data but not receiving any.  My dad went outside to investigate and he noticed that where my cable had been connected to the cable box that it had been unscrewed off.  My dad said that someone must have tampered with the cable and removed it from it’s original location but we didn’t understand why.  Was someone trying to steal our cable?

A few nights later while I was on the computer the same thing happened.  My internet connection had been disconnected and the modem couldn’t receive any data.  I was completely frustrated at this point because all I cared about was that I wasn’t getting my internet.  Then I had remembered that my dad had told me it had to have been someone who had fucked with my cable outside.  It was after 1 a.m. and I was sitting at my desk on my laptop.  I had two windows in my room.  One facing towards the right side of my desk and another in front of my laptop.  Both windows had blinds but no curtains.  I had been too afraid to look outside either window so I went to the garage to peek my head into our backyard from my garage door.  Looking into our backyard I would have been able to see if anyone was standing near the window that was on the right side of my computer.  I could not see the anything surrounding the window facing my laptop because that window faced the other side of the house, being that my room was in a corner of the house.

So I peered outside and quickly surveyed the backyard.  I didn’t see anyone standing near the window that wasn’t facing my laptop.  I felt temporarily relieved, until I realized that I still did not know if there was anyone outside the other window.  I stuck my head out even further to see if I could catch a glimpse of anything near that window the was on the other side of the house.  And then I saw it.

It could have only been maybe within 2 seconds, not entirely sure, but I saw a flicker of something orange in that matter of time.  I thought it was a flag at first, or something that had caught on fire.  I panicked and ran back inside the house, locking the garage door behind me.  I quickly went to find my dad watching tv in the living room and I frantically told him what I had seen.  He went to grab a bat that he had kept in the garage and quietly had gone outside.  I just stood there at the front door, waiting in trepidation and fear.  It had felt like hours when my dad finally came back.  He had not seen anyone or anything standing outside that window, but he had to connect my cable again because it had been unscrewed from the cable box.  I felt so fucking confused.  What the hell had I just seen?!  Had it just been a figment of my imagination?  And if no one had been at my window, why did my internet keep disconnecting?  How was the cable getting tampered with?

Frustrated and tired, I slouched back to my room.  My dad had fixed my cable and the internet was functioning again like normal.  I don’t know what came over me, or maybe it was just my gut but I looked out the window facing my computer.  I peered through the blinds and saw something that has forever been etched into my mind.

I saw a man standing outside in my neighbor’s yard, wearing nothing but a towel around his torso.  And he was watching me, as if he were waiting for me to look out the window.  He smirked, just standing there staring at me while I looked back at him in horror.  That’s when I realized it was my neighbor.

I fell back away from the blinds and I told my dad what I had seen.  I don’t know why my dad hadn’t seen the guy but I assumed he just didn’t look over into our neighbor’s yard when he went to see who was at my window.  While I was in school the next day, my dad called the cops and they came by and did a general inspection of the area outside my window.  They found footprints facing my window but that’s about it.  When I came home and asked my dad what had happened, he said that the cops didn’t end up doing anything.  I asked him if he had mentioned to the police that it was our neighbor.  My dad acted surprised and said he didn’t remember me saying that it was.  For some reason this really pissed me off because I know I had mentioned it was our neighbor.  I don’t think my dad really believes it was our neighbor, but when I saw him standing out there in the dark, looking at me with that smirk on his face I knew it was him.

My sister and I discussed what had happened and we tried to understand why he would disconnect my cable.  She thought he could have been trying to get me off the computer so I would change and go to bed.  And I didn’t comprehend at the time why he was wearing a towel.  I figured he had just showered and that’s what he was wearing when he decided to watch me outside my window.  It’s not until recently that I came to the conclusion he was wearing a towel so he could jack off while standing outside my window.  And if that isn’t disgustingly creepy enough, what scares me the most is the thought that I might have been watching porn while he was masturbating himself at the window, watching ME masturbate.  It scares me to no end because I really have no clue as to how many times he had watched me outside my window and for how long...and if he had not disconnected my cable I would not have realized that I was being watched.

Soon afterwards my mom got me some dark curtains to put over my blinds and I was so paranoid I even hung towels over the windows.  I think I had them up about two years at least before I took them down.  I thought that was the end of that, why would he bother coming back to my window after so long?  Well someone did...but I wasn’t sure if it was him or not because later on I had another creeper.  That’s for another story though."	t5_2t3t8	True
1362607064.0	19svt7	Pretend your legs hurt, sit on the curb, and take your shoes off. 	pokemaster_88	152	23	14	"A couple of years ago I was walking in the neighborhood behind my house when I hear a voice whisper-calling to me, ""Hey, hey. Will you watch my back for a second while I hide this weed?"" 

I turn around and there's this black guy, maybe mid-30s. I'm like, ""What? No..."" And he says, ""My auntie lives right over there and I don't want her to catch me hiding this weed, can you watch my back? I'll give you $20."" 
Let me tell you that I handled this very badly and I was not even interested in the $20. I don't know what made me do this, but I reluctantly agreed. He does not start hiding any weed, instead he keeps talking to me to make his story seem believable after some time of me standing there, very confused. Things start to get really weird when he starts mumbling something about my legs hurting and that I must be tired and I should sit down and take my shoes off. I argue ridiculously that my legs do not hurt. He says to act like they do and sit on the curb so that his auntie does not suspect anything. 
I think, somehow, through either my own gullibility or his expert skills at coercion, he convinced me that my legs do kind of hurt. I am talked into sitting on the curb and taking my shoes off. I was wearing flats so I just flopped them off. I sat there for about half a minute before I started thinking to myself, ""What the hell is going on here?""

I got up and slipped my feet back into my shoes. He starts mumbling something about ""now I'm getting frustrated"" and I peace'd out of there. When I got home I told my boyfriend at the time the story and he and my roommate were very angry with me for letting it go that far. After all, who knows what would have happened? The area I was walking in is an area where there aren't actually a lot of houses, its pretty industrial and is used mainly for art studios. No one was around.

Months later my boyfriend (at the time) was at a party listening to this other girl's story of when she got creeped out, and it was the same description of events. A guy acting crazy and telling her to sit on the curb and take her shoes off. She apparently did not sit on the curb or take her shoes off. He told me about it when he got home from the party. I thought ""oh my God this guy is more creepy than I thought!"" and later forgot about it. 

That was 2 years ago. Then, about a month ago, I was sitting at my kitchen table across from one of my roommate's friends and he starts telling this story, he prefaces it by saying ""Man, I don't even want to tell this story because I handled it so badly but here goes..."" and I'm thinking in my head, ""Yeah, I had a time like that once. That guy who got me to take my shoes off and sit on the curb..."" and then he says... ""So I was riding my bike back from a get together and this guy stops me and asks me to watch his back while he hides this weed..."" He didn't get too far into the story before my jaw dropped. At the end of his story I told him that it had also happened to me and we filled in the blanks for eachother and it was very bizarre. 

Same exact lead-in with the Auntie, hiding weed, your legs must hurt, take your shoes off. ""I'm getting frustrated."" etc. He said that it was 4 months ago that this happened to him, and that *his friend* also shared the same story *with him* that happened to his friend about a year ago. He said that his friend sat there even longer and the guy started asking for sexual favors and things of this nature before his friend fled.

So, varying degrees of this guy's routine have happened to 4 people in Oakland, California, that I've heard of. I didn't think much of it when it happened other than ""glad I got out of there"" but now that I'm older I wish I would have reported it. If it's happened to other people that I have heard about who knows how many more there are.

1357140554.0	15tui0	"""Show me how you do it."""	_theia	168	36	17	"Hello! Sorry this is a little long, I tried to give as much detail as possible because this was pretty odd and more than a little creepy.

I live in Singapore. We're a small island and pretty uneventful! When I was 16, I was out in a popular shopping area with a bunch of my friends. We were having a laugh when this bearded, turbaned man approached us to ""read our fortune"".

Now - I **used** to believe in this sort of thing, and I have to admit that I was a pretty silly teenager - so I thought it would be fun. He asked for $30, then took us to a little corner to tell our fortunes one by one. The corner was next to a fountain, and it had a bit of a crowd milling about on the other side.

It was a little strange - he took barely five minutes with each of my three friends, but took about twenty minutes with me. He insisted that he could only tell our fortunes ""alone"". At the time, it made me feel pretty cool because I was being paid so much attention to. I was so naive, I can barely look back at myself without smacking myself on the head.

He started with a simple mind-reading trick: he would ask us a question, then write it down on a piece of paper, to be revealed at the end. Of course, he would have us say the answer aloud so (on hindsight) I realized that he would actually be writing down the answer to the question that he asked first after we told him what it was, and make up the last answer. He would then show us his piece of paper at the end, and be like ""look @ diz I got it right"". 

He totally did that - I was so impressed that he only made one mistake at the end - which was predicting my dad's name. I thought he was pretty legit.

**Here's the creepy part**:

Maybe a couple of minutes after that, he began touching my hand - holding it pretty tight to ""read my palm"", circle my palm with his thumb etc. He began to play with my wrist, then abruptly dropped it. He looked me in the eyes and said ""do you touch yourself...there?""

I was, naturally, a bit confused. I wasn't sure how to answer. Actually - I was sure. I said ""Uh..what? No.""

""Don't lie to me. I know you do.""

""No...uh no.""

He started to frown. ""I know you do. Don't lie. Show me how you do it.""

What?!

""Um...I don't...know? No?""

""Does it feel good?""

""I'm...no. No?""

He stared at me for a little while - he looked frustrated - and then re-continued reading my palm. I was unnerved and said I had enough.

Before he let me go, he asked for another $60 to pray for my soul every day for two months. I declined, saying I had no money. He offered to walk me to the ATM. I said no, sorry. He asked again, and again, and again. I declined each time, and began to walk away. He looked peeved, then warned me:

""Touching yourself there is very dirty. You should stop doing it."" I nodded a couple of times then walked away. He stood there for a pretty long time, watching us, then went on his way, on to another customer.

He didn't ask my friends anything like that - he didn't touch their hands either. I have no idea why he targeted me - I was severely overweight, was insecure and...oh wait, maybe that's why. I've since then dropped the weight, am pretty fit and not as easy to fuck around with.

On a lighter (and slightly unnerving) note: He told me that I would end up dating a white man when I turned 19, and that he would be my first boyfriend, he would be a very good man and make me very happy. When I turned 19, I met this pretty cool guy and we've been dating three years next month. He's a dorky white boy, and my first boyfriend.

TL;DR: Creepy guy reads my fortune (somewhat accurately) and asks me if I fap, to show him how I do it, I refuse to acknowledge that I knew what that meant, he said to stop doing it, I'm still confused.

1353226829.0	13e4k3	Campsite Creeper		149	20	21	"When my sister and I were younger, our parents would take us and a few friends out camping for a few days for our birthdays. I use the term ""camping"" very lightly, because we had a trailer and a tv and air-conditioning. But instead of all of us sleeping inside the trailer, all the kids would sleep in a tent outside.

My dad would leave the light on the outside of the trailer on just in case we needed to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. We also had a walkie-talkie in the tent just in case we needed to communicate to our parents. God bless whoever came up with that idea.

It was our second night, I think. We were all laying down, probably being a little too loud. Enough for surrounding campers to hear us. It was about two in the morning and we were telling ghost stories, when all of a sudden my sister's friend said, ""Shhh! I think somebody is outside our tent.""

My stomach dropped like I had just gone down a steep roller coaster. I got nervous and super sweaty, and that wasn't only because of the Texas weather in July. 

One of my sister's other friends called bullshit. ""Shut up. Stop trying to scare us.""

""No really! I heard something!""

We all listened but heard nothing.

The subject was changed after that to something a little less frightening. Not ten minutes later, she spoke up again, but this time the situation was much more terrifying. She was laying down with her head near the side of the tent when she said, ""I think I heard somebody talking to us from outside?""

We didn't believe her again. I mean, who wanted to mess with a bunch of thirteen year old girls in a tent? 

""Yeah right. You're just hearing things.""

""No, shhh,"" she insisted. Then she called out, ""Hello?""

It was quiet for a minute, but then all of a sudden, ""Hey.""

I screamed, and dove toward the center of the tent, completely positive that the man outside had a knife and he'd start hacking away at the sides of the tent. He didn't, but better safe than sorry. I grabbed a walkie-talkie, being the baby of the group when it came to scary real life situations. ""Dad,"" I whispered into it, ""somebody is talking to us through the tent!"" 

""What?"" He responded, ""Go to bed.""

I persisted and whined for his help, but he didn't believe me. 

Not five minutes later, we saw a shadow of a very tall man walking along the side of the tent, nearing the entrance.

Then, BANG! The trailer door swung open, and out came my dad in his underwear (he sleeps without pants on, and I don't think he believed us enough to put pants on before sitting at the table inside the trailer to watch the tent). He came bursting out of there so fast that the door swung open and slammed into the wall of the trailer, and he didn't even touch the steps to get to the ground. He just flew out! In only a t-shirt and underwear! And he was sprinting towards the tent.

The creep fled in the other direction, and not soon after, the park ranger was there. My dad wore pants for that.

I don't think they ever found out who the guy was. But I love my dad."	t5_2t3t8	True
1347438637.0	zra4h	The nearest motel?	KeepInKitchen	163	31	37	"To start out, there needs to be a bit of backstory.

After graduation I had to move back to my crappy little home town with my parents. This city has never been a place you could feel safe in, and my neighborhood has never been considered as one of the nicer ones. I grew up hearing stories and reading headlines about all the shitty things people do to each other so close to my bedroom. After a few years of exploring the city, and never having anything more than wolf whistles threaten my well being, I had grown compliant and trusting towards the mass of strangers I called neighbors.

My parents have always been paranoid about home security, so even at 21 I don't have a house key. They're afraid I'll host wild parties or house hobos while they're at work. I've spent many an afternoon parked in the driveway, seat fully reclined, feet out the window, headphones on high, with a wifi connected phone in my hand. If no one is home to open the door, I'm stuck there. I was supposed to have lunch with an old friend from high school, but she canceled last minute. That left me looking forward to at least 5 hours of driveway redditing while everyone I knew was working or out of town.

About three hours in I noticed a pick-up pull up on the other side of the street. It wasn't someone with a key to my house so I went back to killing zombies with vegetables. Fifteen minutes passed and I got this really uneasy feeling. I finished  up my level and glanced at my mirrors. 

I nearly peed. A man was standing in my driveway, close enough to my trunk he could have been molesting my tail lights. I let out a yelp and yanked my headphones out of my ears.

He was gangly, well over 6', buzzed blonde hair, and had the creepiest smile I'd ever seen. I could tell by the pick marks and rotted teeth he was hooked on more than just phonics, and he was flying pretty high for 3pm on a Wednesday.

""I didn't mean to scare you,"" he said, arms raised to show he didn't have anything in his hands. 

""Oh no, I was just startled. I really should be more observant. Is there anything I can help you with?"" I was still shaking, but that was just the residual adrenalin. I didn't have any reason to be afraid of this guy. These little alarms going off in my head were just learned paranoia from too much Law and Order SVU.

""I'm sorry,"" he took a few steps closer to the driver's door, ""I just needed directions to the nearest motel. I'm working in the area, but don't live here.""

I was still a bit flustered, but I gave a brief description of all the local inns and motels and gave him directions to the one he picked. It happened to the closest one to my house, but I didn't really think about that.

""I'm not sure I'll be able to follow that. It's a bit complicated. Could I just follow you there? I'll pay you gas money for it."" 

Now I'm really getting creeped out. He never dropped his smile, not even when he talked. ""No thank you,"" I said, trying to let him know I'm done talking and that he should leave. ""It's really easy. One right and two lefts, it'll be on the left. You can't miss it."" 

He was silent for a few seconds longer than normal, just staring. I was about to roll up my window when he blurted out ""Were you sleeping?""

I was not prepared for this question, or really any question not related to directions or bed bugs. ""Um, no."" I was slightly embarrassed at the fact that some guy tweaked out of his mind thought my behavior was weird, so I started scrambling for some excuse. ""I left my key and I'm just waiting for my mother to get home."" As soon as the words were out of my mouth I remembered the big rule my dad used to tell me when I had to be in public by myself: Never let them know you're alone.

His smile somehow stretched, showing more rotted teeth and neglected gums. ""So a right and two lefts?"" he confirmed, head tilting to get a better look into my little car. I couldn't help but think he looked like a psychotic emoticon.

""It'll be on the left."" I began to shrink back into my upholstery ""I promise.""

""Well it doesn't sound very far. I guess if I can't find it, I can always come back for more help."" He walked back to his truck and just sat there, staring out his window in my direction, that smile still in place. Twenty minutes passed before he left.

I decided that Mickey D's Internet was just as good as my own and hunkered down in the parking lot until I got called home.

Three weeks passed and I had forgotten about the tweaker creeper, until I saw a vaguely familiar truck parked up my street. I drove by trying to figure out where I'd seen it before, and I saw him sitting in the drivers seat. That smile still there. He waved, and I waved back. 

His car is back on the street tonight, but he isn't in it."	t5_2t3t8	True
1346504505.0	z6krz	Halloween fun.	NavywifeJP	154	22	21	"I have more under my belt, but here's a memory from when I was younger.

My dad was the coolest guy on the block, probably because he was one of three black dads who lived in our town. The population is around 98% caucasian* (spelling) and that's not an exaggeration. He was a state police officer, intimidating, wore Oaklies before the hipsters and he was generally a rough-sounding person. Damn do I miss him.

But the one thing he feared the most was Halloween. He would tell my sister and I stories at night about his life when he was in high school in slum in New Jersey, and that every Halloween crazy things would happen. He may have been pulling our legs a bit, but we didn't care.

When Halloween would roll around, he would take us out while Mom stayed home to trick or treat. One night, in fifth grade, Lexi and I were dressed as a witch and '50s poodle skirt girl. Dad held our hands, walking to the last street when I realized I'd lost Moms scarf she'd let me borrow. She loved that thing, so we walked all the way back towards this darker corner of our street. It's by the woods and a small stream, but when it's dark you can't see anything.

Dad said he'd seen something and walked towards it. When he got there, he started slowing down. He was staring at something in the dark that we couldn't see.

Lexi called out to him if he found Mom's scarf. He told her to be quiet, and started crouching down, looking in the distance. For several moments, we stood there, waiting. I could make out the scarf above his head, tied to a branch. He grabbed the scarf tied, still staring in the dark, and started backing away. Then Dad screamed and sort of shuffled backwards. It was a low, throaty scream like he was furious. He was swearing, too, but I don't remember what.

Whatever Dad had been staring at then bolted out of the trees and ran down the street, opposite of where we lived. It was a little child, probably boy (from his silhouette shape) in a black costume with skeleton bones on the front and a skull mask. When Lexi and I tried to go over and see what had happened, Dad yelled for us to stay back. He got onto his (ancient) cell phone and called Mom to come and pick us up. His next call was to the local police.

We left before we could see anything, but the next day Mom told us about the dead, skinned animals that had been found. By the time us kids could go look, they'd taped off the place and taken out the bloody animals, but there were stains on the pavement and the smell was pretty bad. The kids talked about it in school a little, and I was curious if they ever caught the boy. Nothing came out in the local papers, though, and it was quickly forgotten. Eventually, Dad could have told me more, but it was the last Halloween we'd ever spend together.

But I do remember him and Mom arguing for the next couple of days about ever letting us go trick-or-treating again."	t5_2t3t8	True
1330843990.0	qgxc1	How my mom avoided a creeper	Zargyboy	151	25	11	"So I think you guys will like this story.  My mom has some pretty interesting stories about weird situations that have happened to her and since she doesn't use Reddit (at least I don't think) I would like to relate this one on her behalf.  This was one story she told me regarding taking the subway late at night.

A number of years ago, back in the 80's, my mom lived in the Bronx Section of New York.  She had been out in another part of the city that night (possibly Brooklyn I think), and was waiting for the train.  As she she got down to the train stop she realized that she was the only person there.  Not really thinking about it too much she stood there waiting for the train alone.  After a few minutes go by some random guy comes down to the subway stop as well.  She doesn't really think much of it but all of the sudden this guy starts acting creepy.

As soon as he gets down to the subway platform he says something to my mom like ""hey baby looking good tonight""

My mom doesn't turn around, instead deciding to ignore the guy.

The guy starts to move closer to her saying, ""my baby you so cute don't act like that.""

Still my mom ignores this creepy.

Again he moves within a few feet of my mom saying, ""hey baby c'mon you so cute""/etc.

Mom ignores him

Finally he gets close enough to my mom and punches her in the shoulder saying ""hey b*#@$ I'm talkin' to you.""

In a moment of what I could only say was sheer brilliance my mother turns around and in the best impression possible says, ""I sothry I'm defth""

The creeper exclaims, ""Aw man a deaf chick!"" and then walks away and leaves her alone."	t5_2t3t8	True
1372240879.0	1h3lck	He used to be a creep like them, but then he took an Icee to the nose...	typhoon937	153	27	22	"So this story took place in the middle of the suburbs, quiet neighborhood, to my best friend and I, both 12 M at the time. (We're 17 now)   
We were just hanging out during the summer, and it gets pretty hot where I live, so we decided to walk up to the store to buy some Icees. We walked through my neighborhood, and to cut some time off, we went through the back of the middle school to get there. When we were behind the school, we passed some older kids, probably 16, smoking cigarettes behind the school, and we didn't pay much attention to them. I remember the one kid vividly though. He was really short, probably about five foot even, and he wore super baggy clothes. Like XXL sizes on a kid who would fit into a small, and he always wore military-esque pants, but with chains hanging off in all directions. I was friends with some high-schoolers at the time, so I knew this kids name was Kurt, and he had a reputation for being a thug.  
Anyway, we passed them, walked to the store, bought our drinks, and started home, the same route we had taken to get there. We passed the guys again, and they asked us if we wanted to buy some weed. Neither my friend or I have ever been smokers, so we just laughed, said no thanks, and kept walking. We were joking around on the way home, and we started to notice a jingling sound behind us, kind of like *chains.* I subtly turned my head and I noticed Kurt following us, with a big shit eating grin on his face. At this time, we weren't too freaked out, but we took a sharp turn and increased our pace to get away from him.  
He still followed us. At this time, we were walking parallel to some woods, and I had noticed Kurt had his hand in his pocket for a while. I started to get freaked out, so I pointed it out to my friend, and he suggested we go into the woods. Now these woods didn't go anywhere, just backed up to some houses, so we knew that if he went in after us, he was for sure following us. So we ducked into the woods, and sure enough he followed.  
So we did what any smart kids who grew up in the woods and knew how to handle them would do, and started running and dodging around to lose this city-slicker. I turned around to see if he was still behind us, and he was, and he had pulled his hand out of his pocket, and he was carrying a giant chefs knife! This thing was probably a foot total, with at least an 8 inch blade. We were coming up on an embankment down into a creek, and it was around this time that I realized that I was still holding my Icee. So I got to the bank, looked down, saw it was probably a six foot drop, turned around, launched my drink at him, spun and dropped down into the creek. As I hit the bottom, I heard a thud followed by a loud ""FUCK,"" and I started running. Once my friend and I were a distance away, we turned around and there Kurt was, kneeling in the mud, nursing a superbly bloody nose, with my Icee laying next to him in the dirt. We started laughing and took off running home.  
When I got to highschool, I had grown a considerable amount, now nearing five foot eight, and Kurt was still tiny. He tried to start something about it once, but I socked him in the eye and that was the end of that. Last I heard, Kurt was serving time for assault and possession with intent to sell.  
TL;DR: Creepy midget chases me and my friend through woods with a knife, and I broke his nose with a popular frozen drink."	t5_2t3t8	True
1370725498.0	1fy1pn	Park encounter.	PerpetualAmnesia	155	25	25	"I was around fourteen/fifteen when this happened and am female for anyone who wants to know. There was a park where I used to go whenever I had a row with my parents (which was often). This meant that I could turn up there in the middle of the day or the middle of the night, there was no real pattern to it and nothing weird ever happened before that night. 



I tended to sit on a bench which was right at the back of the park by a wooded area as I didn't want anyone to see me crying. Of course I realise now how stupid this was, but I was young and really unhappy. It must have been about nine/half nine at this point and it was just starting to get dark (summer). 



This guy came and sat next to me, which might not be that weird normally, but he came from the woods rather than the park. The other odd thing I noticed was that he was wearing a t-shirt, shorts and black gloves. He might have been around forty, or maybe a bit younger, but I have always been rubbish at reading ages, so not sure. He was about 6ft 5 and quite stocky, bit fat. 



He asked me what was wrong, which embarrassed me and I can't remember what I said in response, but it was probably fairly hostile. He then commented that I was really tall (I was, 6ft 2) and then kind of laughed really creepily and said something like, 'I'm bigger though'. 



I always tend to listen to my instincts and he was reading about a 7 on the freak o meter, so I decided to leave. As I went to stand up he reached out, as though to grab my arm or something. He smiled again, but it was one of those that don't reach your eyes, so you just look creepy. He asked me to sit back down and tell him what was wrong, but I just said that my dad was waiting for me and I had to go.



He then said that my dad wasn't waiting for me and that he'd seen me walk into the park from the main road by myself and that liars get punished. I just turned and ran. In those days I was pretty quick, but instead of running in a straight line I weaved through the playground equipment, figuring it would be harder for a bigger guy to get through tight spaces. 



I got to the other side of the park and turned around to see if he was nearby, but he was standing by the slide just watching me. There was another guy standing at the edge of the wooded bit. He would basically have been right behind me when I was sitting on the bench. 



Neither one of them attempted to chase me and I ran out onto the path that led to the main road. There was a van parked in the car park, but at that point I didn't connect it with them.



When I got out to the main road it was fairly busy for that time of night and I stopped running. I decided to go home, but about halfway there I saw the van from the car park on the road behind me. It never attempted to overtake anyone, just continued on the same route as me. I turned off down a road that was near my street (but not actually it) and after a couple of minutes the van turned down it as well and parked at the top of the road. No one got out, but I think there were two people inside. I was afraid to go home then as I thought they'd know where I lived and my parents often left me on my own as they were neglectful douche bags.



I knocked on the first door I saw and thankfully an old lady answered. She took me inside and called the police. By the time someone came the van was gone.



They never caught either of the guys from the park (not sure how hard they looked as they hadn't specifically done anything) and I hadn't thought to take a note of the van license plate or anything like that. I still have no real idea what they had planned, or if they were just trying to freak me out, but the gloves and the van make me think it could have ended badly. 

Edited for the wonder of paragraphs.


TL;DR: I'm sulking in park when I get two creeps for the price of one. Having nothing better to do, said creeps possibly try to follow me home. Happy days.

1368635064.0	1ee1s7	Our neighbor with the van.	stalkersloveme	157	28	31	"I know that I just posted a story a few days ago about my stalker at school, Viktor. I swear to god though, DAYS after I find out that Viktor is back, this new bullshit starts. For the record, I am female, and a college student.

Basically, I moved into a new house on May 13. It's farther away from campus, but also literally half the price of rent at my old house. The only real downside is that the location of the house definitely isn't ideal...it's between several businesses and a small apartment complex. I've got a 7-11 at 2 o'clock looking out my front door, a U-haul storage lot to my immediate 9 o'clock, a self-storage place to my 6 o'clock, and the apartment complex to my 4 o'clock. I didn't think it would be an issue at all, and despite its slightly sketchy location, I'm living with two pretty large guys, so, I figured nothing would be an issue. We had toured the house, everything was going well, and on May 13th, I moved in with my roommate James (previously mentioned in my other story, actually), and my boyfriend, who is living with me for the summer before he goes off to work in the real world. 

During the day, we were all moving large furniture in from my old house, wandering around outside, just doing general moving-in stuff. The cable guy was coming, etc. We noticed on our first run that there was an extremely run down white van in our driveway. Now, the driveway isn't really a driveway, but more like a gravel lot. Nevertheless, it's our gravel lot, and it affords us plenty of parking. For the time being, we ignore the van and continue our move. We figured that when our neighbor saw us moving in, he'd move his van to the apartment parking lot, and it would be done. Early in the morning after our first load of stuff, the van disappeared, and we thought it was done. About an hour later, he ZOOMS back into his spot, in front of my car, and between the U-haul. My roommate and I are like ""ummm okay,"" but we just ignore it. We're outside the next time he comes out, again about an hour later. He begins backing up, and as he navigates out between my car and the U-haul, he begins screaming obscenities out the window at us as we leave. We find it strange, since um, it's our house, and also because he was the one who chose that parking spot, seeing where both my car and the U-haul were already parked.

We're irritated, so I make a note to ask my landlord about the car and if we could ask him to stop parking there. It's about 6PM, and all the heavy furniture is moved in. We're just taking a break, setting up the house, doing some cleaning. It's me, James, his friend Katharine who is staying for a few days before her summer lease starts, and my boyfriend. We walk into the dining room, which has two double windows that directly face the apartment complex. We ALL stop short. Our neighbor with the van is standing at his window with his blinds open, but not pulled up, staring into our house BLATANTLY with his fingers pulling the blinds apart so that he can see better. We all freak out just a little, because the apartment complex is only like 40 feet away, and that was SUPER creepy. But we're like, um, okay, whatever, I'm sure he's not looking at us. Okay. We retreat. This continues for hours. Like 6 hours. I snapped a few pictures while I was crouching in the dining room under the window, just for the record. As I stated in my last post, I've had issues with harassment before, and I want to document EVERYTHING. Here are two of the photos. I'm crouching in the dining room, and my roommate's friend Katharine is in the kitchen. He's watching her. [Here is one photo](http://i.imgur.com/zJPDsaW.jpg?1) and [here is another one with zoom](http://i.imgur.com/10obJOt.jpg?1).

Eventually, after hours of this, he goes to bed. We do as well. The next morning, I go to the realtor's to drop off my rent check for May. I talk to the owner of the house on the phone about a few repairs, and mention the van. The owner says I can leave the van owner a note asking them to move their car off of private property. I honestly probably wouldn't have cared if he hadn't scared us so much the night before, but at this point I just want him off our property with no reason to be near my house. I write the note as soon as I get home with the help of my boyfriend and roommate, as the van is parked directly in front of my house. We make it polite-- We tell him that we understand he's been parking there while the house has been unoccupied, but now that we're here, we'd like to have our entire driveway free to use. My boyfriend goes and puts it out under his windshield wiper. My boyfriend is barely back inside before the van owner comes out with his massive wife. He becomes VIOLENT. Screaming obscenities at our front door, screaming for my boyfriend to come out and take it like a man, screaming that he will not be disrespected by kids like us, that it's not our goddamn house, etc. It scares the shit out of all four of us. None of us were expecting a violent reaction like this at all. We call our landlord and explain the situation.

About 10 minutes later, Katharine has to leave to go to work. James walks her outside and apparently our neighbor had been watching out the window, because he comes RUNNING outside screaming. ""HOW DARE YOU YOU FILTHY CHILD YOU CAN'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO I'M GOING TO KILL YOU YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME YOU CALL YOUR LANDLORD RIGHT NOW I'M BEST FRIENDS WITH HIM I CAN FUCKING PARK HERE IF I FUCKING WANT TO,"" etc. More was said but I don't remember. Our landlord comes over and informs the man that it is private property and that he cannot park there. They negotiate so that he can park at the end of the gravel lot for a few days and then he must move it. I'm not happy about this arrangement, but okay. During my landlord's conversation with the neighbor, he threatens us and tells us that he will be watching our house and that he will be calling the police on us if he sees alcohol. 

We honestly are just really freaked out by the violent explosions from him. While we're not concerned about the police (we're all 21 and won't throw parties here since it's farther away from campus), but it's just the fact that he pledged to ""watch our house"" and stuff. He proceeds to watch us all night from his window. 

We're not exactly sure what to do here. I suppose we just wait and see. James and I are considering going to the police to maybe get an incident report filled out in case this escalates, but we don't even know this man's name. I tried to look it up online by his license plate, but I can't find a free database.

I guess we just have to wait and see, and hope that it doesn't escalate any farther. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1365317186.0	1bubf3	Creepy Uncle (possible trigger?)	notamous	167	42	21	"I've been reading this subreddit a lot and never knew if my story fit but after reading a few similar I thought I might be able to help anybody going through the same thing.

Well, my story is the same as many others. I had an uncle (by marriage to my father's sister) who was an alcoholic. My mom was a single mother and worked 24/7 to make ends meet. So, I had to be babysat by this uncle every now and again because my mom couldn't afford daycare. I actually blocked out a lot of the things he did until a few years ago when I realized it was not okay.

He would do things like make me sit back with my legs up on a lounge chair so he could look up my skirt or my shorts. And he'd say, ""I can see your panties"" or ""I love your panties."" After he said that one time, I called him a pervert, and he got very mad, turning red, and got so close to my face I could smell the beer on his breath. I thought he was going to tear me apart. He went and got some beer instead.

Once he made me lie in bed with him and watch a Disney movie with him while he touched my legs very slowly and softly, breathing deeply, and gasping, sweating. He would rub himself on me and as a young kid I just remember him rubbing on me, making a strange noise, and getting up to go to the bathroom. 

He also used to give him long hugs and he would make me, as a nine year old or something, drink out of baby bottles while he watched. 

He took me for ""walks"" and told me he wanted seven wives to kiss and touch all parts of his body, and asked me if I could be one wife, and if he could kiss my breasts.

He would show up at my house when my mom was away and sit and ask me strange questions and if I'd like to shower for him. As a young child I didn't understand. I was terrified.

I was very young and very scared and didn't have a father, and figured my mom wouldn't leave me with anyone that wasn't a nice person. I realize now much later that he was a very bad man, that ruined me in a lot of ways, and I often cry about the experiences.

But I guess what I'm here to say is that if anyone (family member or not) is doing this to you, tell someone. If I had told someone, it would have stopped. I moved far away but he's still out there now and he never got in trouble, while I have to live with the nightmares of him masturbating on my leg. 

Tell someone, don't be afraid. Don't let it ruin you like it ruined me... 

I hope this post belongs here. I just never shared it before.

Edit: I just remembered that he used to kiss and touch his wife in front of me, all the while never breaking eye contact with me. That was a reoccurring nightmare, too. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1363788808.0	1anvrx	When homeless attack	returnkey	147	20	55	"I used to reside in the city of Houston. I grew up in the 'burbs, but moved inner city as soon as I could get away from the strip malls and chain restaurants.

I moved to inner-loop Houston (the 610 loop is a freeway that unofficially separates the metro core from the residential/industrial outskirts of the city) to a small historic neighborhood- the Montrose district, that was mostly attractive to college students, artist types, young people, gays, etc. Montrose is pretty socially liberal and probably the most ""out there"" Houston neighborhood, culturally speaking. Lots of cool antique rental properties and garden apartments for singles and couples in their 20's, but not the kind of area that most people can afford to purchase a house or have the space for a family. 

I was very young when I first moved to Montrose, so I ate it up- the dive bars, restaurants, music clubs, coffeeshops, street fests, proximity to the museum district, it was great, but every pro has its con. 

Montrose wasn't super scary crime ridden or anything, or at least I never felt unsafe there, but it was a little rough around the edges. 

Drugs were easy to come by (which meant a high concentration of drug users, obviously, and the behaviors they often come with), car break-ins were relatively common (my window got smashed twice in 4 years, which seemed about the average.) 

There was a decent sized homeless population to be berated by- don't get me wrong, many of them were perfectly polite and harmless, but there were a good handful that were bold, shameless, and persistent. 

While muggings weren't the norm (to my knowledge, none of my friends were ever mugged) it was definitely important to be aware of your surroundings if you were out and about, especially if you were alone or it was after dark. 

So one morning, about 8am, I'm heading to work. I stop off at the drug store on the corner next to my apartment to grab a juice and some cigarettes before I hit the bulk of my commute. There's typically at least one homeless guy hanging out in this particular pharmacy's lot at any given time, but it's not worrying, they're usually passed out and no trouble, just resting in the shade from the structure, away from the hot sun.

As I'm walking in, I see a grizzled, white homeless dude wandering around the far end of the parking lot, quite a ways from me. It seemed strange, as they don't tend to panhandle here and it's too boiling hot to be comfortable wandering around on the asphalt in direct sunlight. Additionally, I don't see any cars parked on his side of the lot, and no one's around for him to interact with, so his movements seem aimless and random.

He sort of glances my way, but it's hard to tell from that distance if he's looking at me or not. From where I'm standing, it looks like his eyes are just randomly darting around, fixating on one point of the parking lot, then he quickly strides to that empty spot, and then he finds another spot a few feet away to look at and then skitter to. I don't feel threatened, but I'm definitely aware of his presence (and questioning his stability.)

I make it into Walgreens undeterred, get my stuff, and wait in line to pay. I'm inside 2-3 minutes tops. I step out the exit and glance toward my car. I feel relieved when I don't see Mr.Crazy on my end of the lot. So I start walking to my parking spot. I've made it maybe 5-10ft from the store's exit (the car's another 20 feet or so away) when he appears (seemingly) out of nowhere and steps directly in front of me, blocking my path. 

He asks me if I have any money I could give him. He's older and pretty worse for wear. I feel bad for him, but I'm creeped out and in a hurry to get to work. I tell him what I often say to panhandlers, and it's usually true- Sorry, I don't carry cash. 

I step around him and keep walking, quickening my pace. I hear his footsteps follow me, just as quickly. From behind me he demands ""I know you have change!"" At this point I'm rushing to the car, a hair away from breaking into a sprint. 

""Sorry, I can't help you!"" I loudly respond without so much as glancing  back toward Nutterbutter McGee who is still on my ass. I hit the unlock button on my keys and have my arm out, ready to reach for the door handle. 


My hand slides onto the handle, I yank my car door open and jump into the driver's side of my sedan. Before I'm even seated correctly, I immediately grasp out to slam and lock the door. Too late. Psycho Sam is now facing me, standing in the space between the open car door and I, blocking it from closing with his entire body. 

My car was just your standard 4 door, so as you can imagine, I am now in awfully close quarters with The Crazy. To make it even worse, he leans down so that his face is just about level with mine. His hair and beard are unkempt, his eyes are wild. As if I needed further confirmation, (I didn't) this is not a sane individual. 

""Give me all your money."" He didn't point any weapons (at least that I could see) or scream or raise his voice, he just sternly said the words in a very matter-of-fact tone. As if this were the obvious directive and my compliance were a given. 

I was terrified. I stared up at him for a second not knowing what to do. In an instant, adrenaline slammed into me and instead of immediately responding to his demand, I kept eye contact with him on my left side while my right hand shoved the key into the ignition and turned. ""Uhmm, no"" was all I could squeak. 

And ladies &amp; gentlemen of reddit, that was the day I ran over a hobo's foot. I would do it again too, if I had to. Fuck that guy.

1343597573.0	xcwf1	Selling Magazines	scarecrow896	157	31	37	"This is a story that happened more than a decade ago. After creepin' on this subreddit all day I decided it fits in this category. I apologize in advance for my poor grammar and overall bad story-telling ability.

I heard a knock at the door and looked through my peep hole. There was a man standing there, holding several pamphlets and a clipboard in his hands. He was your typical mid-20s normal looking guy. I hesitated for a minute, knowing I wasn't supposed to open the door to strangers. Being 12 and invinsible though, what's the worst that can happen?

I opened the door and he began some speil about needing to sell so many magazines for some college trip. I told him I wasn't interested. He said, ""Oh come on, I only need two more subscriptions and I'll have enough."" I told him I was not interested, I had no money, and my mom wasn't home (I have no idea why I threw in that last part). 

At that point I seemed to have peaked his interest. He asked, ""Why does your mom need to be home, you're what, 17 or 18?"" Okay, nice try guy, I absolutely looked like a 12-year-old. I said, ""No,"" leaving it at that. He said, ""Well, can I at least bother you for a glass of water? I've been walking around all day."" I obliged and asked him to wait right there. I closed the door but not fully, as that would be rude. When I returned with the glass of water, he was standing in my living room. He must have seen that that scared me because he quickly said, ""I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. It's just really hot out there."" I nodded and handed him the glass.

He slowly drank the water, examining the room. He looked at family photos, touched items that did not belong to him, and was really just getting too comfortable. I didn't want to come off as rude but said something along the lines of ""Okay, my mom should be home soon and I'm not allowed to have anyone over. So...""

He said, ""No, no, I completely understand"" and handed me the glass. He thanked me and started heading for the door and I followed, walking him out. Then, he stopped dead in his tracks and turned around. He said, ""I hate to be a bother but can I use your bathroom?"" He could see the unsure look and my eyes and added, ""Then I promise I'll be out of your hair."" I nodded and pointed to our hallway. I said, ""First door on your right."" He smiled. Not a normal smile, one that instantly makes you feel uneasy. He asked, ""Can you show me?"" I repeated, ""It's the first door on your right."" He said, ""I don't want to intrude, I would much rather you show me."" Creep level was now at an all-time high. I was frozen, unsure of what to do. 

Just then, my mom walked in from work. She looked at the strange man standing in the living room and back at me. He put his hand out and said, ""Hi, I'm Josh"" and went into his whole spiel again before explaining that I was nice enough to give him some water on this horribly hot day.

I still think to this day, ""what would have happened?"" had my mom not walked in at that exact moment. After that day, I didn't care about being embarassed for being rude. If I don't know you, we're not fucking talking--especially in my house.

1341794052.0	w8tp2	Close Call	poniesgalore	143	14	23	"I've been meaning to share this story for a while, only two other people know about it, I don't think anyone in my family knows. It's been burned into my memory. I found r/letsnotmeet today and figured this would be a good place to share.

I grew up in a affluent suburb on Long Island. My parents always took care of me and I was lucky to lead such a great life, starting early. Nothing ever extremely terrible happened to us as a family, no sudden deaths, no money problems, and my sister and I usually got everything that we wanted. I was a lucky kid. 

One day, the family took a day trip out to IKEA. I must have been about 8 or 9. I forget what we were buying, but i remember that it was large and it required some assembly. One of those items that you purchased and had to pick up the box in a different area of the store. My sister and my mother went to get the car while my father and myself went to pick up the large item from the back. it was a particularly busy day, there were a lot of people, and workers seemed overwhelmed. My dad and I waited our turn for our number to be called  on a couch located in the back of the room. There were TVs to watch, I think one of them had nickelodeon on, so I didn't mind the wait.

Finally, our number was called, and my dad told me to wait on the couch while he picked up the box and brought it back over. Something happened as soon as he got to the counter, because he ended up waiting longer than he bought he would. 

As my dad left for the counter, i noticed two hispanic men standing off to the side, just staring at me. As soon as they saw me looking at them, one came over. He was nervous, kept checking back to his friend for approval. Finally he reached me and asked in a shaky voice, ""is anyone sitting here?"" I just simply replied, ""my dad, but he's up at the counter now."" and the man sat down. 

I was a tall child, maybe 5'6"" by the time I was in 6th grade (12 years old.) The legs of my pants never fit, they were always too short. My sister and I had this thing about collecting socks from Kohls. They had all different kinds with all different patterns. Each time we went shopping we would BEG our mom for a new pair or two, to add to the collection. They would stick out of the bottoms of our pants for the world to see.

I distinctly remember sitting as far away from the man as I physically could on the couch, jammed up against the arm. I was focusing so hard on the TV and trying to ignore him. He finally piped up, ""I really like those socks. Where did you get them?"" He spotted my socks, I remember they said I &lt;3 CATS with a picture of a cat on them. ""Kohls."" I replied, trying with all my might not to have a conversation with this man. He inched closer on the couch, trying to put his arm around me. ""Why don't you come with me and my friend? We have fun toys for you to play with."" I froze. I turned towards him, he had this nervous smile. I looked for my dad. Still standing at the counter, waiting for the desk or whatever we bought that day. I knew that everything about this was wrong. I immediately jumped up and ran to my dad, pulling at his hand to let him know that I was next to him. 

This all happened in the matter of minutes, and to to this day it is still as traumatizing as it was 12 years ago. I burned the socks, and haven't set foot in an IKEA since. All I could think about is what would have happened to me that day. Im glad 8 year old me had the sense not to go with the creep. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1362622776.0	19th12	He was looking at me in the shower	Zoogirl07	160	29	14	"This happened a very long time ago, I was between 7 and 10, I can't remember exactly.  It's not something I've ever forgotten, even though I'm nearly 30 now.  It didn't *seem* like a big deal when I was a child, but as I've gotten older it creeps me out more and more.

**Background**
I was in a father/daughter organization for a few years with my dad and several other girls and their dads (we all lived in the same area).  It was a lot of fun; we went camping, did crafts, etc.  It was good old fashioned father/daughter bonding that I still look back on with fond memories.  Except this random memory.

One time, our group went camping.  It wasn't true camping, as there were group bathroom facilities that all the dads and the daughters shared.  Anyway, my little self was in one of the shower stalls.  You know the kind, concrete floor, with cheap plastic panels dividing the other stalls from each other and the hall.  Since the plastic panels weren't fixed in place, there was about a 6"" gap from the wall to the panel.  

I knew there was someone in the shower next to me, and as a young girl, I was curious about people and bodies, etc.  Yay growing up.  Feeling nervous, I leaned back in the shower to try and see through the gap.  

Peering back at me, mouth wide open, was one of the other girl's dads.  As soon as he saw me, he kind of jumped and quickly disappeared from my sight.  My heart was pounding and I immediately felt like I was in trouble.  As a child, I automatically assumed I had done something wrong and he had caught me and would tell my dad I was peeking on him in the shower.  

The rest of the trip I was sick worrying that my dad would say, ""Haley's dad told me what you were doing.""  But nothing ever happened and her dad never said anything either.

Eventually I forgot about it.  I still don't think about it much, but when it pops into my brain it gives me the complete heebie jeebies.  I can remember the exact look on his face, his naked torso, the fear I felt in my chest that I was being bad.

As an adult, I realize that he was watching me shower, and I just happened to catch him doing it.  We all went on so many overnights as a group.  I always wonder if he creeped on the other girls.  I've never said anything about it.  

20 years later, it still creeps me the hell out.  "	t5_2t3t8	True
1362566466.0	19rpg0	Kip	crackrock_dude	148	20	14	"When I was a young boy, about 9 or 10 I guess, I used to play in the park and down the creek after school with the other boys until it got dark, then walk home for dinner. 

it was great, they were some of the funnest years of my life, until I started seeing a man who called himself 'kip'. I dunno how old kip was but he looked a few years older than my dad, so I'd guess he was in his 40-50's. At first I just used to see him n he'd wave n say hello, then eventually he started walking me home and talking to me. I never mentioned him to my parents because naively I just presumed him to be a nice old man. 

It never started to worry me until he started asking me to come back to his house. I was young but this rung alarm bells, I knew that seemed off. So I said no thankyou, and he seemed fine to let me decline. 

But from then on whenever I saw kip he'd always try and get me to come back with him, and got more insistent as time went on, it probably took place over maybe about a month s time I think, but one evening he got really mad at me and started yelling at me, saying I had to do what he said, I was really scared so I told him I had to go but he grabbed me by the arm and hissed at me you're not going anywhere or something, I dont remember exactly what except I remember I was really scared and I didn't know what to do since it was already getting dark and there was no one around. But then I heard the familiar sound of my dad's motorbike coming round the bend, and my god I have to tell you hearing that bike that evening was like music to my ears.  I guess kip knew the sound too somehow cos he let me go and walked away without a word. My dad stopped when he saw me n told me to jump on the back n he'd give me a ride, and I started crying. After we got home dad managed to get the story out of me,i told him everything. And he was really mad, my ten year old self thought it was me he was mad at me so I just spent the rest of the night sulking in my room. 

I was in bed that night, my bedroom is on the front end of the house. Anyway,i was in bed when I heard my window banging, I was scared, but a curious kid, so I peeped out to see what it was, it was kip! Fiddling with my window! Dad must have heard it too cos by the time I screamed out for him I heard the front door burst open and saw kip turn and run.

He made it to front fence and I saw my dad drag him down and start beating the living shit out of him.  my mum came in and took me away from the window and sat in bed with me hugging me and telling me we were all going to be fine but even though I was young I could see how scared she was.

I could hear lots of yelling and shuffling going on, then the front door shut, and my dad's voice calling my name. he calmed me down and told me I didn't have to worry about kip anymore and that it was ok and stuff.  I never saw kip again but it freaked me out a lot, and for a long time I wouldn't play outside.  we never went to the police with this, and I don't know what dad did with this guy since I never talked to my dad about it, but I'm sure as hell glad he was there that night looking out for me."	t5_2t3t8	True
1351876607.0	12itkw	"""Come here or I'll kill you."""	Tamyu	146	17	12	"This happened when I was 14 or 15. It was right around this time of year, so I am not totally sure (my birthday is this week...)

Every Friday night, I would meet my boyfriend to see movies played for free at the local university. They had a club that would show foreign films, anime, etc, subtitled by the club members. They held it in a small lecture hall (I think?) in one of the science buildings. It was like a mini theater, and just all around fun.

His dad would usually pick me up and we would go together, but sometimes that didn't work out. My mother was unreliable at best, so I would often take the bus. Thinking back, heading around town on the public bus at 14 wasn't exactly safe - but I was 14. Invincible. Nothing could ever happen to *me*. And my mother certainly wasn't worried about me.

I began to notice that one guy kept staring at me on the bus. He would always get off at the same stop and silently follow me. By the time I would meet up with my boyfriend, he was always gone. It was a university though, so I just figured he was a student. It wasn't a weird out of the way stop.

One night, I met up with my boyfriend and we discovered the door was locked. The door auto-locked, but they would prop it open or use tape to hold the mechanism open. It was clear that the showing had started and the door had just shut somehow, so my boyfriend decided to go around and find another door to go in. The building itself was huge, and interconnected with a bunch of other buildings around it. Somewhere had to be open. He would then come and open it so I could get in. So I waited.

A bit after he left, the guy who I always saw on the bus sort of came out of the shadows and said, very calmly ""Come here, or I'll kill you."" He was carrying something - a bat or something like that.

There was no way I was going to go. He was still a bit away, so I screamed and ran. Started banging on the doors to the labs around and trying to open them. The second I tried opened to a big empty science building. I ran like I had never run before down the hallways, making as many turns as I could, eventually hiding in a random room. After what felt like forever, I crept out and found my way through the building to where we had actually planned to go. My boyfriend was outside the door looking for me... The guy was nowhere to be found.

I never saw him again, but then again, I never rode the bus there again either and made sure I was never alone. I still can't imagine what would have happened if I had not run. 

Thankfully nothing really happened - I am not sure if he even followed me. I wasn't stopping to check... But it scared me to death.

1344077856.0	xo0xk	Close call(s) with a child molester.	Caesaresque	146	15	28	"When I was young, I used to play cricket - I won't bore you with the ins and outs of that. The club had a couple of coaches, all good people, yet one was a bit 'different'. He was a real disciplinarian, and used to really lose his temper and scream at us kids. The parents used to call him 'Little Hitler', but his real name was John. At the time, everyone just assumed he was a moody individual, but time would reveal that his disciplinarian nature had a more sinister undercurrent.

The creepiest thing I ever heard him say before stories came to light was when he told a lad that he had 'young boys bodies in the groundsman's shed' and that he'd be joining them if he didn't do as he was told. Now obviously he didn't as they'd have been found, and at the time I just thought it was a mock threat that came out slightly strangely. I forgot about it until later events.

One time, I approached John and asked him if I could buy a cricket jumper from him. He said of course, and told me to go around the back of the pavilion to the car park and meet him at his car, where he had the jumper in the boot. I did, and was alone at his car with him, until someone else came out of the pavilion and got something out of their car. He sold me the jumper, and I returned to the pavilion. It seems an innocuous event at first, but when later events came to light it appears that the person getting something out of their car could have saved me from experiencing John's sick machinations. 

I had a second brush with Little Hitler, this time on my way to school. He lived around the corner from me, and I would pass his house on my walk to school. I used to walk with my mother - who has a very cautious and worried nature, at times a problem, but this time to my immense benefit. Shortly after passing his house, John pulled up in his car alongside us and said to my mother 'Oh there's no need for you to walk all that way, here, why don't you let me give him a lift to school?' As at this time nothing had come to light regarding him, it would have been easy to assume that the offer was him being kind. Fortunately, for whatever reason, my mother sensed something amiss and said that she'd walk me the rest of the way as she 'had to meet a friend up that way anyway.' Without saying a word, the guy rolled up his window and drove off - probably pissed off that my mother had stopped him claiming another victim. At the time, the event seemed again, innocuous. But when certain allegations came to light, the events didn't seem as innocent and kindly as they first appeared.

One day, I arrived at the cricket club and John wasn't there. When anyone asked, the other coaches changed the subject or said they didn't know - presumably so as not to disturb us kids. Our parents soon found out, however. John had been arrested on suspicion of sexually abusing minors. Prior to being a cricket coach, he was affiliated with the Sea Cadets. Apparently, he'd abused young people at sea - the extent of the abuse I do not know, but apparently it left the victims extremely disturbed. I'm pretty sure, although this is just my opinion, that there must have been many more victims too scared to come forward, either out of fear of John, or fear of being ridiculed or not believed.

Time went by, and cricket resumed as normal at a fine club, without John's presence and over the top levels of discipline. All we knew was that he had been arrested, and we were kept 'out of the loop' unaware what was happening. In fact, I'd almost forgotten about him, until one day. I was sat in the living room with my Dad, and he was reading the paper. He called my Mum over and showed her a particular article. She expressed shock, then said 'I heard alarm bells ringing from the moment I first saw him'. This piqued my curiosity, and I asked to see the article. There, taking up the top half of the page, was John's face staring out of the paper. Below was an article detailing his offences, and a footnote saying that he'd been convicted and was to serve a ten-year sentence. This is when it dawned on my family that when John offered me a lift, I may not have made it to school unharmed. It also dawned on me that had that individual not gone to their car when I was alone next to John's car, something depraved could have happened to me. I silently thanked first my Mum's cautious nature, and the stranger who emerged from the pavilion for his perfect timing. It feels strange to know just how close I came to being a victim, and it honestly worries me how easily John went undetected for so long. Sure, he was a weird guy, but no one would have guessed him to be a paedophile. Although I'm young and don't have my own kids and it may not be my place to comment, I'd just like to urge Redditors with kids to be extremely careful with who you trust around them - no matter how friendly or helpful they may seem. Apologies for the length of this story, I know it's not particularly suspenseful or a particularly good read, but I've simply documented events as I recalled them.

I Have Arnold–Chiari malformation, so i usually like to keep it quiet and not be the loud one in my group of friends, as it causes me extreme headaches almost to the point of passing out because of the pain and also dizziness. But one particular day, my friends had convinced me to just take a lot of ibuprofen to counteract it before hand, so that's what i did. We had all decided to go to a large spring, which is used by the locals for swimming since its pretty deep. Our whole group decided for a little friendly competition to swim from one side to the other, just for shits and giggles. I wish it would have remained so light-hearted. Me, being the person i was, ( I took swimming lessons for 11 years and was on major swim teams in my county) I made it first and was flaunting it by waving to the rest of our group, who was only still halfway across, even the most athletic of us were only 2/3 the way there.


Anyways as i waited (its a very forestry/natural place, with vegetation covering up almost anything, so it was unlikely my group saw me at this point after i stopped waiving and boasting) I felt a presence behind me but before i could turn around a male hand grasped my mouth and pulled me down to where i was sitting on him. The position resembled how a grandfather would hold his granddaughter on his lap, but much more sinister and forceful. I tried to kick and scream, but my strength was slowed A LOT from the amount of ibuprofen i took to counteract my Chiari. He had a rusty box cutter and it was resting dangerously on my throat. As i was struggling, he pulled my face closer to his and said ""I could kill you right now, i'd enjoy every minute of it."" I was still forced on his lap, as he was strangely petting my hair like a small child. Thankfully, one of my athletic friends finally made it across and started rustling though the bushes to come get me. As soon as the man heard my friend call my name, he ran away without a trace.


I collapsed into my friends arms and sputtered and spit and cried out my words. We went home and tried to file a report with the police/guards that own/patrol the springs. Minutes after we left their cabin, i heard them laughing and joking about how i was making it up and ""stupid woman must have been PMSing"". I broke into tears again. To this day i still remember the lustful and hungry look in his eyes as if he would get some sort of enjoyment from my dead corpse. Honestly, that was the worst feeling, being that close to death and not having it even in fate's hands, but those of an evil human being."	t5_2t3t8	True
1369857995.0	1fafkw	Do you have a daughter I could tutor, sir?	briv	145	16	16	"This happened when I was around 9 years old in the summer. I am an only child, and when I was younger, I spent much of my free time playing by myself, riding my bike around the neighborhood, or going to the houses of a couple neighbor kids on my block and playing outside. It had always been an extremely safe community and crime wasn't frequent. All in all, my parents never worried about me going out to play by myself as long as I didn't go too far, and I never did. I never felt anything less than safe. However, looking back, I realize now that I should have.


One summer day, my mom was working, and I was home with just my dad. I was planning on going outside in a little while to go play with a neighbor boy, but I hadn't left yet. Out of nowhere, my dog started barking and second later, I heard footsteps on the deck by our front door, and the doorbell rang. I peered out another window to see who was outside, thinking it was maybe the neighbor boy coming over to ask if I could come outside, which he did almost daily, but it wasn't.


It was a man, probably around college age or a little older, but I really can't be certain. I was only 9, so anyone over 14 looked like a grown-up to me. There was a bike in the driveway that he must have arrived on. My dad hadn't come to the main room yet, so I started to go towards the door to see what this guy wanted. I was just a kid, and like I said, the neighborhood was always safe so I didn't think anything of it. I knew not to talk to strangers and all that, but since it was at my own house and my dad was there, I figured I could answer the door. Before I got there, my dad came upstairs from the basement (the stairs are right by the front entrance), looked out a window at the man, and said he'd get it, and to go to the other room. I went to the dining room and watched around a corner as my dad opened the door.


He only opened the main front door and not the screen door, so the man could not get in, but I could still hear the conversation. The man asked my father if he had any daughters in need of a tutor. Well, that's oddly specific. It was also summer, remember. No school. I heard my dad lie and say no, it was just him and his wife living there- no kids. The man at the door seemed confused and asked my dad if he was sure he did not have a daughter in the house. My dad just told him to leave and get off his deck, and he left. I saw him ride down the street on his bike from the dining room window.


As a kid, I realized there was something off about the whole situation, but I didn't really completely understand what had happened. My dad simply told me afterward not to answer the door at all if I didn't know the person, even if my parents were home. Looking back, I realize the man, whoever he was, must have been watching me play outside for who knows how long. He was certain there was a little girl in the house. He asked specifically about a daughter, rather than just kids in general. I also feel like he wasn't expecting my father to answer the door. At that time, my dad worked night shifts and would come home at 7 or 8 in the morning, and would usually sleep until around 3 or 4 in the afternoon. My dad happened to have the next night off, and was staying up that day. I think this man might have known my dad worked night shifts, and could have inferred he slept most of the day. He seemed a little thrown off when my dad answered the door, which may have been why his obvious lie about looking to ""tutor"" during the summer was so easy for my dad to see through. 


To this day, I will not answer the door unless I know who it is. If I'm home alone and someone knocks, I try to peek out windows as sneakily as possible. I am so glad my dad was there that day to answer the door, and that I hadn't gone outside to play yet (I stayed home that day at my dad's request). I never saw the guy again after that; he never tried to come to our house again, to my knowledge, and I never saw him around the neighborhood. I have no idea who he was, how he knew about me, or what could have happened to me if I had ever met him myself. I'm glad I don't know these things.


**TL;DR:** A man came to my house when I was 9 and asked my dad if he had any daughters he could ""tutor"". It was summer. He was a creep."	t5_2t3t8	True
1367093037.0	1d8dn1	"""Do you know where Sarah is? Where is she?"""	JumpsTheTurnstiles	145	22	21	"I discovered this subreddit a couple weeks ago and have enjoyed reading everyone's stories, and thought I would post my contribution.

I live in a two-family house with my mom and 5-year-old sister, and a couple months ago we had a new neighbor move into the other half of the house. A single mom with a young daughter. She had only been moved in for about a week when we had this happen:

It was 1 AM when I was sleeping in my room. I was fast asleep, but I remember suddenly opening my eyes, wide awake, but still laying down with my blankets on and everything. I had heard a man's voice. It took a second for my eyes to get adjusted to the dark, and I saw a tall figure in a heavy coat and a beanie just standing at the foot of my bed. I was completely terrified and I couldn't move.
The guy was just staring at me. He said ""Sarah?... Sarah?"" It took me a second to be able to make any sound. I was too scared to scream so I'll I could say was ""...what?"" He just kept saying ""Sarah?... Sarah...? Do you know where Sarah is? Where is she?"" I eventually mustered up the strength to say ""There is no Sarah here. I don't know, just please leave."" But the guy just fucking stood there.

I keep a knife in my bedside table, and wanted to reach for it, but I couldn't even move. For some reason, I felt that if I made any sudden moves, he would do something rash. He stood there for a weirdly long amount of time- like he was contemplating something- before saying ""Oh. Oh, ok. Sorry."" completely nonchalantly. He stood by my bed for a few more seconds, and then really slowly left. I was still frozen. I waited until I heard the front door close. Took about 2 or 3 minutes. I was trying to piece together what just happened. Every night, my mom ALWAYS double-locks the door, so I had no idea how this guy got in. I assumed she had just forgotten this one time and, ironically, this is the one time that someone actually broke in.

I went into my mom's room, woke her up and told her what happened. We investigated the house to make sure he had left, and went outside and checked the yard. My mom told me that the woman who had just moved in is named Sarah. So I figured she had just had some late night visitor, and since she had just moved in, her friend got confused and came into the wrong house (even though he was creepy as shit and didn't respond to an accidental entrance the way a normal person would). So we didn't call the police or anything. Just assumed it was a mistake. I was still really creeped out though.

The next morning, we ran into Sarah outside the house and told her what happened. We asked if her friend had found his way to her place and everything. She just casually responded ""No, no one knows my new address besides my sister, I wasn't expecting anyone. Must've been looking for a different Sarah"". And she brushed it off then she went inside.

What. No. Way too coincidental.

A little later that day, our landlord called and informed us that right after we spoke to her, she had frantically called him, demanding new locks for her house, crying and freaking out. So, it seemed pretty safe for us to assume that she had some kind of stalker (possibly why she moved in the first place) and he had found her new address. My mom decided to call the cops, I gave them a description, but there wasn't really anything they could do.

We have since changed our locks, and still have no idea who the guy was. All I know is, waking up to a full-grown man standing over your bed when you haven't lived with any men in 3 years, is pretty damn disturbing.

TL;DR: Creepy guy gets into my house, stands over my bed and asks me of I know where my neighbor is. Confront neighbor, she has ""no idea"" who the guy was.

Edit: I'm an 18-year-old female. Just to give some context."	t5_2t3t8	True
1364813328.0	1bey64	My 3am visitor	weatherleaf	170	41	42	"This happened about 3 years ago when I was 14. I'm also a girl, if that makes a difference. My family lives in a decently safe neighborhood in a small city, so these kinds of things don't usually happen here.

 I live in a two-story home, that's shaped kind of like an L.....so you can see it, http://imgur.com/37CTIu3 At the top floor is my brother's room and mine. Mine, is the one that is farthest back.

 So, one night, around 3 am, I was dead asleep in bed. My mom, brother, and his friend were all awake talking downstairs in the living room. You know, just talking about life, giving advice and such. My other brother and dad both were gone, so it was only us. While talking, they suddenly heard movement on the roof, so they stopped and listened. They didn't hear anything else, so they went on talking and assumed it was a bear or raccoon. At the time, only 1 light was on in our house, and it was the 1 that is above our stove, and it's very dim. No one could see in.

 While talking they heard more movement, but this time it was louder. Then they realized someone was walking on our roof. My mom ran upstairs to come and get me out of bed. I was startled awake by her frantic quick knocking, because I sleep with my door locked. She said in a whisper like yell ""someone's on the fucking roof."" I quickly jumped out of bed, and that's when I saw him. I saw a man with a white mask, pressing his face against my window trying to see in. At the time, I had sheer lacy curtains with red trim, very girly. At that point, I quickly ran out of my room and downstairs.

 My brother and his friend were both outside throwing shit at him. Yes, throwing stuff lol. They were trying to get him to come down and face them. The guy was like a sitting duck. My brother and his friend decided to go back inside to get some kind of weapon. When they came back out he was jumping down from the side. They chased him way down the street until he ran far into the forest and they could no longer see him because he was wearing black. The cops got to our house after he was gone. We filed a report and they searched around, but nothing ever came of it. To this very day we have no idea who or what he wanted. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1360824883.0	18i2y0	Window Creeper	butifeelcelestial	158	32	12	"When I started high school, my mom, her (thankfully now ex-)husband, my 10 year old sister and I moved into a new house. There wasn't anything really special about it, except the bathroom had a window and the backyard had a chain-length fence that wasn't finished on one side. There were two gates in the fence, one on the side and one at the back. There was also a freaky little shed that looks kind of like a small house in the backyard. 

When we moved in, I mentioned to my mother that the bathroom window freaked me out and I thought something should be put up to cover it. I don't do uncovered windows and it was right in the shower and looked out into the backyard. My mom assured me that I was being silly to worry about someone looking in since the window was about seven feet off the ground and we lived on a busy street. 

For a while, everything was as fine as could be, considering my mom's husband was a raging, abusive douchecanoe. It was easy enough to avoid him since I spent most of my time in my room. As long as the chores were done and he couldn't find a reason to yell, it was fairly peaceful. After a couple of months, he found a reason. He would hound my sister or myself into going out to close the gate because one of us left it open. It took a couple of weeks for us to have a conversation about closing the gates. She thought it was me and I was sure it was her since I rarely went outside. We came to the conclusion that it was him and he was just too lazy to go back out and close them, so he sent us instead. It gave him the chance to be verbally abusive and he enjoyed that.

This continued for a while. The gate that was open was usually on the side and it was almost every day. 

It finally ended one night towards the end of my freshman year. My mom worked third shift but had weekends off. When she worked I spent the night at my aunt's, but when she was home I stayed there. It was Saturday night, probably around 11. I was partially asleep as I watched something on TV and I had a lamp on. I always slept with a light on because of a fear of the dark and the fear of bugs crawling on me while I slept. We had four cats by then and they can do a number on blinds. The blinds over my window and the ones in the living room were broken on one side, so it was easy to see inside or outside. My window faced the street, so I didn't think it mattered. As I was laying there, someone started knocking on my window. I immediately feigned sleep. I knew whoever it was could see me because of those damn cats and I was too afraid to make a run for the door. They knocked for several minutes, with the knocks getting louder each time until it finally stopped. I don't know how long I continued to lay there and pretend, but eventually I ran out. I woke my mother up to tell her what happened and she insisted it was just a dream. I slept in my sister's room that night. The next morning, my mom's husband was preparing food and looked out the window to see the gate open. That time, he took it upon himself to close it and when he went outside, he immediately came back in, got my mother, and called the police. There was a ladder propped under the bathroom window.

The gist of what the police told us was, ""Hey, free ladder!"" The husband and his friend patrolled the yard with a shotgun for a few nights after that, but the peeper never came back for his ladder. The gates were never left open again, I taped black construction paper over my window and the shower window was covered after that. It took a shamefully long time for me to realize that even though it would have been easier to use the side without the fence, it would have been louder because of the gravel. Now I almost wish I had went outside to kick whoever it was in the balls for the super fun abuse heaped on us for what his laziness.

TL;DR: Gate constantly left open because perverts will bring their own ladders. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1359262381.0	17csa3	"The Stalker in the Black Hood
"	supermassivemuser	166	38	26	"I should start off by saying that I'm a very smart girl. My parents taught me everything about creepers and stalkers. But that couldn't stop them from coming after me.

My dream is to be a journalist, and I currently work on a school newspaper for my high school. A month ago I wrote a piece about one of our teachers who recently passed away from cancer. He was one of the best teachers, and throughout his whole fight, we all did our best to support him. My piece was very emotional and personal, and I received tons of compliments. A few days after the story was published I was walking home from the library when I noticed a boy (I assumed it was a boy my age) in a black hood staring at me from across the street.

I was pretty creeped out, and my heart started racing when he began walking towards me. But then he dropped his hood and I sort of recognized him from my AP Euro class.

He jogged up to me and said, ""Hi! Sorry to bother you but I just wanted to say that I adored your piece about Mr. *******. It brought tears to my eyes. He was one of my favourite teachers.""

""Thank you so much! I'm glad you liked it! He was one of my favourites too.""

We talked for a little while as he walked me to my house (I know, bad move). We mostly talked about our teacher, and how much we missed him. Then we talked about our classes, school, etc. When we got to my house he asked me for my number. I thought he was very nice, and also very cute, so I gave it to him (again, bad move).

He called me a few days later and asked if I wanted to see a movie with him and some friends. I wanted to go, but I had three midterms to study for, and I told him this.

A few hours later he showed up on my front porch, wearing his creepy black hood. I found it very weird, but I still had a little crush on him so I was willing to 'forgive and forget'. He said he really wanted to see the movie with me, and I finally relented. He drove me to the theatre, and I started getting creeped out again because his 'friends' weren't there. It was just the two of us. And things just got weirder from there...

Throughout the whole movie, he played with my hair. He commented on how soft and heavy it was, and at a few points he even smelled it. I know I should have got up and left right there, but the irrational part of my brain told me that there was no way I could walk home (it was January, and around 0 degrees with the wind chill). 
He finally took me home and walked me to my porch, and then proceeded to grab my shoulders and kiss me flat on the mouth. I pulled away in shock, but he just smiled at me and walked back to his car. I ran inside, and locked the door. 

He left me alone for a few days, until classes started up again and I was forced to see him. He stared at me throughout class, which made me very uncomfortable. And as I was leaving, he hugged me from behind. I did the first thing that came to mind, and shoved him off. He gave me another creepy smile, pulled up his damned black hood, and walked away.

For the next few weeks, he would continue his creeper stares. He would usually distance himself from me, but I would still receive the occasional  hug from behind. Not once did I think about asking for help from any adults. I thought it was annoying, but not that serious. I did complain to my friends, but they just laughed and joked, saying he was the closest to a boyfriend that I'd ever have (don't get me wrong, they're great friends, they just didn't see the real danger yet).

One day I was walking home, he appeared again, and ran up to me. I thought about running away, but then I decided the best thing would be to tell him off so he'd leave me alone. I opened my mouth to curse him out but he interrupted me. He started going on and on about how he's loved me for three years, and has been waiting for the moment that he could run his fingers through my hair and kiss my soft lips. He said he wanted me to be his, and that he'd hurt anyone that got in the way of our love. As he said this he grabbed my hand and put it over his heart.

Now I was really freaked out. I said something along the lines of ""If you come anywhere near me I'll beat the fucking shit out of you! Don't think I won't do it you fuckass creep!""

But he just kept smiling, so I went to Plan B. I booked out of there like the track runner I am. And I didn't hear from him for another week. He wasn't in school, and part of me thought maybe he transferred or moved. How foolish I was.

I came home to find a package sitting on my porch, addressed to me. I know I should have been more careful, but I had actually been expecting a package from my uncle, who lives in Switzerland and is always sending me stuff. I brought it up to my room and opened it. 

The first thing I saw was a card with my name written on it. I didn't even notice that it wasn't my uncle's handwriting (I can be so stupid sometimes). I opened it up, and oh god how I wish I hadn't. I'll spare you all the details, but it started out with my stalker stating how he loved me more than life itself, and how he would cross oceans and so on in order to be with me. He talked about the first time he saw me, how long he loved me, descriptions of my 'delicious, soft, beautiful hair' and how badly he wanted to run his hands up and down my face.
Then things got more graphic. He said he wanted to strap me onto my bed and 'fuck me until I left scratches down his back and the sheets are soaked'. At that point I stopped reading, and just threw the card across the room, I was so disgusted. I know, I shouldn't have looked at what was in the package, but I've always been too curious for my own good, and now was no exception. 

I tore through a mountain of white tissue paper and found an album book and a weird scarf thingie. I opened the album book, which contained a few dozen pictures. They were all pictures of me, some far away, some closer. I was with with friends, with family, running on the track, giving a speech on a podium after receiving a writing award. One was even of me reading a book on my porch. I was bawling my eyes out at this point. Then I turned to the scarf, and slowly unraveled it. What I saw made me choke in horror. 

It was a chunk of my hair, cut from my head and tied together with a thin red ribbon. I chucked the whole box at the wall and collapsed on the floor crying. After a few minutes, I looked back over at the box, and saw something I hadn't noticed before. A picture of me with my best friend Jamie. But that's impossible, that picture was in a frame on my dresser...

There was no postmark on the package 

I finally broke down and told my mother. We were never really close, which is one of the main reasons I never told her in the first place. She wasn't too concerned at first, until I showed her the card and the photos. She absolutely freaked when I showed her the hair. She called my father, and then the police. They confiscated the box and all of the items as evidence. They also questioned me about the stalker. I gave his name and a description of him, and they suggested I get a restraining order. 

My friends and family were very supportive, which I was grateful for. In the time leading up to the restraining order, I did see him in school. He would still stare, but whenever he tried to get close, my friends would form a circle around me and tell him to fuck off. Again, I was very grateful. 

I did eventually get a restraining order, and he left school to be home schooled. Every once in a while I see him, always from a distance, thankfully. But to this day I continue to ask myself how he managed to steal a picture off of my dresser, or how he cut off a piece of my hair.

1347456376.0	zriy8	Library Books	junemeatcleaver	141	17	32	"Okay, so I live in a small, rural town. There isn't a lot of work here (obviously), so I travel up to the nearest city to help with special needs adults and integrate them in fun community activities. I really enjoyed it! Now, I'm not much of a city girl, so it took me awhile to finally figure out how to get to the headquarters. I finally got the hang of how to get there and where to park. I always told people I felt very Carrie Bradshaw figuring out the workings of the city all by myself.

 I was always raised right and I knew how to avoid scary situations (don't go out alone at night, don't go in dark alleys etc.), so I felt pretty confident walking back to my parking garage in the middle of the afternoon. I got about halfway there when I was standing at a crosswalk and a man came and stood next to me. He was dressed in casual business attire, carrying a briefcase. Very normal looking in my opinion, so I didn't think much of it. He made a small comment about the amount of traffic and I politely smiled, but did not answer. Then he asked, ""What's a pretty girl like you doing all by yourself in the city?"" 
This automatically sent off every red flag I've ever learned in elementary school and I replied ""I'm just meeting my friends right up here."" thinking this was the proper thing to say. When the light turned, I immediately bolted across the street and kept going towards the garage. I noticed about three blocks down that the man was still behind me. i felt very uneasy, but I continued to go. As I neared the garage, every instinct inside of me told me not to go in that big empty garage by myself. So I made a turn and went around the block in a circle, knowing this would prove for certain he was following me. And he was. I was welling up with tears, unsure of what to do- so I ran into the public library, the most open space I could think of. I ran in and went into the women's restroom and sat in a stall and waited for a few minutes. 

I called my then-boyfriend (notice the then) and asked him to come up and get me and he said he was too busy and to just wait it out. I called my brother and he said he was on his way, but coming from our tiny town- so it would be about a half hour. He told me to wait it out and just stay in a public place. I popped my head out of the bathroom and figured I would kill some time reading. As soon as I looked out, I saw him standing in the lobby, looking around the library. I ran back into the bathroom and sat there for around 15 more minutes. I looked out again, and he was gone. So I went over to a crowded study area and sat at a desk. I couldn't bring myself to do anything else, I was too shaken up. 

I sat there and sat on my phone and constantly watched the clock. I sat for what seemed like an eternity when I heard a small voice behind my ear. ""I have a present for you.."" The hair on the back of my neck shot straight up and every drop of blood in my body froze. I turned around to see the man standing there with a book. It was an art book with paintings of picnics. 
He said ""Would you like to go on a picnic with me? You seem like a girl that would like picnics.."" I turned and said in a loud, authoritative voice ""You need to leave me alone right now"" hoping to attract the attention of other library patrons. He got closer to my face so I could smell his breath and said ""I'm an artist as well, come with me and I'll show you my art. It's just right down the street, come on.""

 At this point, I am in tears and I am terrified and I scream ""LEAVE ME ALONE!"" This obviously attracts the attention of everyone else, so people start to look over at us. This upsets him. He throws the book onto the desk, lowers himself eye-to-eye with me, and whispers through gritted teeth ""Obey the law. Protect your face."" And I say ""Excuse me?"" and he runs away before someone comes over to ask if I was okay. To this day, I have no idea what that statement meant, but I quit my job the next day. I still do not go downtown. 

EDIT: I checked the book after he walked away. It was not a library book. It was his own. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1335716524.0	sy9z4	The Dog Killer	HankHillll	144	18	36	"I grew up in a very small town of about 1500 people, and I thought it was a place where everyone knew eachother; until one day I went wandering with my friend down some railroad tracks.

My friend and I were 12, we had grown really close over the last year and had taken to wandering around town any chance we got, trying to find interesting new places in the tiny town.  It was a ridiculously hot summer day when we happened to be walking along the railroad tracks, talking about what we would do if we happened along a would be killer.  It was innocent 12 year old banter, and we kept on walking, reaching a corner of the tracks we had never before encountered.

The trees near the tracks seemed to be thicker there, and curved in towards us.  We both got a creepy feeling about this area, but were excited to continue as it was entirely new territory we had never seen before.  We turned the corner and looked down towards our right.  Down about a 10 foot embankment, a trail started winding its way into the forest.  It was about the width of a car, so we weren't too creeped out or anything, and being the curious 12 year olds we were, it obviously had to be investigated.

Making our way down the embankment, we promised eachother that whatever was down this path, if something bad happened, we would run as fast as we could back to my friends house.  (As it was the closer of our houses).  We continued walking down the path for about 20 feet when we came to a clearing.  It wasn't too big, but in the middle of it there was a shack, obviously poorly constructed by someone who did not want any interaction with society.

My friend and I looked at eachother in fear, wondering if whoever lived here had already heard or seen us.  We stopped and listened just at the outskirts of the trees for any sound or sign from inside the dilapidated building.  A minute passed and we didn't hear anything, so we continued to creep towards the shack, beyond curious at this point.  (In hindsight, this was obviously a bad move, as this was almost the creepiest place I had ever been in my life and we both could have been murdered in a moment and no one would have heard it).  I was the first to reach the uneven porch, and I stepped up onto it as quietly as I could, my friend just two steps behind me.  We could faintly smell cigarettes and mold coming from inside the building.  Was someone actually living here? We had to find out.

I slowly peeked my head up into view of the window, and could make out various objects inside.  A small wood stove in the corner, an obviously hand made coffee table, a dirty mattress on the floor.  Looking around for signs of life and not finding any, I signalled to my friend to follow me inside.  Pushing the creaky door open, a smell hit us that was indescribable.  The best I can descirbe it was like hot garbage mixed with a porta potty and burned wood.

Now that we knew no one was there, we were free to talk normally again.  We walked around slowly, inspecting things, wondering aloud who in their right minds would live in a place like this.  Our town was too small to have homeless people, but I guess whoever lived in that dump was the closest one we had.  There were broken egg shells all over the floor, along with coffee grounds, numurous banana peels, and pieces of paper covered with writing.  I picked up what appeared to be a journal and found an entry going back to 1978.  I read it aloud to my friend and we both got chills.  The entry was titled, ""My First Kill"".  We new we had to get the fuck out of there as soon as humanly possible.  Without thinking, I pocketed the journal and we both turned for the door. That's when we heard the treebranches breaking...

The colour left our faces and we turned towards whatever was making the sound.  We could see out of the small, dirty window directly behind us that a pudgy man with shaggy hair was making his way out of the forest, heading for the shack.  We half ran, half tripped towards the door and opened it as quietly as we could.  Not knowing which way he was going to come around to the front, we guessed and went around to the left.  It turned out we were correct.  The creepy man turned the corner and hopped onto the deck just as we were hopping off.  Just then he yelled/screamed, ""WHO HAS BEEN IN MY HOUSE?!?!"" All I could picture when he bellowed was the big, bad wolf, and for some reason that scared me more than ever.

My friend and I turned to look behind us and the man was leaping off of the porch towards us! We had no time to think, we just ran as fast as we could down the windy path towards the train tracks.  The man was surprisingly fast, even though he was a little on the heavy side, and he was only about 10 feet behind us when we reached the embankment... We scurried up it as fast as we could, hoping that the stocky man wasn't as fast with climbing as he was at running.  We continued to run down the tracks, our lungs and legs screaming at us to stop.  We only bothered to look behind us when we had to go down another path onto a well used road.  The man was thankfully nowhere to be seen.  Although he wasn't near us, my friend and I continued to jog towards her house, even though it was probably 35C out that day.  Once we got there, we shut and locked the door and collapsed onto her couch.  That's when I remembered the journal.

I opened it and we began reading.  Every single entry was about his love of killing dogs, and the new ways he had created over the years. It was beyond horrifying.  We were thankful that he wasn't killing humans, but who knows what he would have done if he had caught us in his house without us hearing him outside first...

I haven't thought about that man in a long time, but finding this subreddit, it all came back to me and I thought I should share.

TL;DR My curious friend and I found a creepy shack where a man who kills dogs lived. A chase ensues, pants are almost shat.

1334336291.0	s85s3	[My] number had to be changed.	Buried_Dolls	153	29	21	"Around October of last year, my mother thought it was a great idea to buy a car from the auction block in Illinois.  The car was only 700 bucks and it was a complete piece of shit, but it ran, the heat worked, tires were good, so why not.  She gave me the keys and I was able to use that to visit my sisters and go to school, look for jobs, the usual.

On the way from dropping some clothing off to a Goodwill bin, the car shut off.  I wanted to get it checked out immediately, so I took it to the auto-mechanics shop for a quick diagnostics.  The guy at the front desk, Oscar, was a pretty cool dude.  He was good natured, funny, even said that the ring on my finger was a throw off even though he knew I wasn't married.  I found his skills of deduction impressive at the time, and he asked for my number.  I told him I'd think about it.

A couple of hours later, I got the call to come pick up the car, but unfortunately it costed too much to fix at the time.  While I was paying for the check up, Oscar offered me his number and I gave him mine in turn.  As soon as I left the place, he called.  Like, right away.

""I want to see you again.""  And I was like.. uh.. okay.  What time do you get off of work?  He told me the time, which was fine, because it was after I had to pick up my kids from school.  So I asked if we could meet at the Starbucks near to his job.  (At first he offered to pick me up at my house, I -always- meet people AWAY from my house, I'm somewhat of a recluse and I don't like when people randomly show up, which in this case, is a damn good thing.)

So, I got a nice coffee and he got some juice, we sat outside and smoked and talked about past relationships and what we were looking for in other people.  All in all, the conversation was a really decent one that didn't raise any red flags.

It wasn't until he walked me back to the car, where we were still talking, that he proceeded to push my hair out of my face.  Odd.  Then I said that I had to leave, and he immediately asked for a kiss.  What?  I told him no.  Then he asked for a hug.  I thought this was reasonable and gave him one, but it lasted -way- too long, he wouldn't let go.  I had to say 'Okay' at least three times before he let up.  So, I hurried up and got into my car and left.

The weirdness didn't start yet, it actually started an hour after I got home.  He texted me and said he wanted to meet up again, and I said fine, lets hit up my Uncles bar and go shoot pool.  I gave him a time and a date and the place, and everything was alright.  I didn't think I'd hear from him -right- after, so I took a nap (probably from a headache).

When I woke up a couple of hours later and checked my phone for the time, i saw that I had at least 30 goddamned texts from Oscar, telling me about his car, saying how it broke down and he fixed it, that he really wants to see me and he misses me, and asking why I haven't texted him back and he's getting worried.  Then asked if I was ignoring him and if I even liked him, and what was going on and who I was talking to.  This guy went apeshit in a couple of hours and all I did was just go to sleep!

So I told him in texts that his constant texting was freaking me out and to let up a little.  He said okay and goodnight, he'd talk to me tomorrow.

Dinner was made and cooked, kids bathed and in the bed, and during that span I get spammed with 10 messages.  What are you doing.  Are you mad at me.  Did I do something wrong, why won't you answer.  So I ignored him, went to sleep.  Woke up?  More upon more texts, why aren't you answering, do you want to talk to me at all?  I'm going to call in a minute, why won't you pick up the phone?  (I believe he did call, my house has shitty reception, thank you Sprint!)

It was just something that I didn't want to see when I woke up in the morning and I was seriously glad I didn't give this creeper my address.  So I told him flat out, You're texting too much and it's honestly bothering me.  How about we call this a loss and not meet?  At the time, I felt like complete shit, but I was honestly creeped out and I promised myself that if something bothered me, I'd be open and honest about it.  He asked why, and said that he'd stop, and it felt like I was already in a damn relationship with the dude already?  So I told him that we just don't need to see each other and lets move on.  He didn't answer back.

I thought everything was fine until the span of the week I kept getting random texts of.. why won't you talk to me, can you come meet me?  I'll come pick you up and we can go get something to eat, as friends, etc.  Then I got the 'If you don't answer me by Thursday I know we won't be meeting Friday.'  Which was weird as shit, because I told him I didn't want to see him at all cause he was a creeper.

So I just ignored the texts, Friday came around and my phone was spammed to holy hell with apologetic texts about how women always treated him and how angry and upset and depressed it made him.  And this was all during my creative writing class.  So I turned off my phone so I could focus, and the minute I got a break (the class ran for two hours, so we got 30 minute breaks to stretch legs and just fuck around), I immediately turned the phone on, called Sprint and requested an immediate number change.  The amount of people I had to call and the paperwork that I had to put in afterwards was completely worth it, fuck that guy.

I know this story wasn't much, but this guy creeped me the hell out and raised too many alarms.  As a single mother with kids, my paranoia extended to the highest level that entire week and I was watching where ever I went for a few months after that.  And I never went to that car shop ever again. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1372882869.0	1hl8hv	Date my Son!	scarlerdior	147	19	47	"I come from a small town in Canada. We only have 2 bars in the whole place and they are frequented often by the locals in the winter and summer. Same old people that know each other, some get a long so do not.

In the summer time we get a lot of cottagers and people from the city. We like to call them cidiots because some of them can be really douchey, rude and simply have no regard for politeness.

Well one night we were at the local bar and having a good time. I went there with a girlfriend of mine and her 2 friends whom I have never met. But they were really nice but not my type.

I see a Cadillac Escalade all black with chrome rims and a white Mercedes pull in to the parking lot. I was kind of intrigued so I made sure to take note on who walked in the door. I suddenly feel a touch on my shoulder and it's a young Arabic/pakistani/indian man asking me to dance, I politely declined. I must say I am not racist, but he wasn't my type, I like metal look. 

I found him to be very weird as he was sitting at the bar staring at me. He takes out his cell phone, takes a picture of me (the flash was the dead give away) and seems to be sending it to someone. Within 5 minutes those people who I saw pull in the parking lot earlier come inside. It is an older Arabic/Pakistani/Indian (forgive me I come from a small town in which the population is pretty much white so I am not sure exactly the race) He looked about 60 he had 2 middle aged men with him and 1 younger male about my age, who I must say, was pretty cute! 

I continued dancing with my friends on the dance floor but couldn't get passed that creepy feeling I was being glared at. My friend tells me that those men are staring at me and pointing and it's kind of freaky. I decide to get off the dance floor and go sit down with my friends and have some drinks. The older man came over to my table and tapped me on the should and asked me to come over so he can talk to me. I walked over and he said I want to introduce you to my son. He waved his son over and we shook hands and said hello. I asked him if there was any reason why he wanted me to meet his son and he said I am a very beautiful girl with nice hair and clothes and that he wants me to date his son. I kindly said no thank you I am currently seeing someone at the moment. He kind of looked at me with a weird look of disappointment mixed with rage. He then put his arm around me and pulled out a wad of cash and said come on let us buy you a drink and talk to us more, you may want to leave that other man. 

I looked over at my friends and they were waving me over and were like WTF. I said one minute and talked to this man a little more (stupid me I know, but I was curious at this time) I asked where they were from and they said Mississauga and they were wondering if I want to go up to Ottawa and party for the weekend at their mansion. I declined and he kept pressuring me on to his son. I finally got his arm from around me and walked over to my friends. 

They took a couple more pictures of me before leaving the bar. I thought that was really weird, like am I being targetted for a kidnapping or am I being shopped around to being someones wife or something, maybe a sex slave? I had no idea, but it was too weird for me. 

Last call hits and we decide to grab our jackets at the coat check because it could be a very big line. We grab out jackets and wait outside for our taxis to come. Stupid people were jumping and pushing for cabs in front of the bar so we decided to walk down to the other street and call one from there. We waited a few minutes and who comes rolling around the corner? Those men in the bar. They have a third car with them. My friend and I, the person I was seeing and the 2 men that came with us were all freaked out and they stood there blocking me from their view. They called me over to their car, I did not go. They got out and were walking towards us and my friend snapped pictures of them and said she also wrote down their license plates. They called her a whole bunch of hurtful names got in their cars and drove off. 

I didn't go back to the bar for a while, but apparently there was a rumor going around to be careful because there are men trying to lure girls into the city with them. I don't know what they wanted from me, I don't know what they are doing with the pictures. I stll don't know what to think of it."	t5_2t3t8	True
1362960742.0	1a1uwe	My sister's creeper	thelazyloser	168	45	46	"My sister and I went to the same high school, but she was older and leagues above me on the popularity scale. She was a senior and I was a sophomore. I barely had any friends yet she was friends with the whole school. Her birthday was coming up and she wanted to throw a party at our house to celebrate. She invited almost everybody and sectioned off a part of the house to have some privacy from our parents. The tally was around 200 people. They came in droves and stayed till about midnight. 

There was a person there named Andrew. I never met Andrew like I did most of her friends. I found his wallet behind the couch in one of the rooms they were partying in. Inside it was his photo ID card and a picture of my sister and a note folded away in one of the pockets. I went to my room and read the note.  Here's what it said:

""Happy Birthday Ashley! I'm so happy for you. Do you know how awesome you are? You are the single best girl I've ever met. Since the moment I saw you I've been crazy in love. I can tell you like me too. When you smiled at the picture I drew you in art class, that's when I knew you were the one. Everything about you is perfect. The other day I saw you going into the girl's bathroom. I followed you and waited a few seconds for you to come out because I had something tell you. Maybe I shouldn't have but I went inside and got in one of the stalls to play a practical joke on you. Girls rarely like to be friends with me and I think it's because I'm not funny enough. I know girls love it when guys are funny, especially you. So I wanted to do something funny so you'd like me more. I wrote our names on the wall with a heart drawn around them instead of pulling a prank. I was in there as long as you were but I'm sorry I just couldn't think of anything funny. After you got done I walked out behind you and went back to my class. I felt so bad. I blew my big chance to make you think I was funny. I promise I won't miss out the next time. My idea was to write you a note explaining how much you mean to me. Never has anyone meant this much to me in my entire life. I love you Ashely and I know that you haven't loved me yet, but that's okay. We have time.""

No doubt I showed my sister the note. She didn't really care and thought it wasn't real. A week goes by. The doorbell rings. I answer it and I see Andrew in our front yard running back to his car parked in the street, engine running. At my feet is a bouquet of roses and one plush teddy bear. He drives off and Andrew doesn't come back until three years later.

But this time he doesn't ring the doorbell, he breaks in. Nobody was there though. My parents were at a BBQ and I was somewhere with a friend. The neighbors saw our front door kicked opened and called my parents then my parents called me and I called the police. We knew it was him from a clue he left engraved on my sister's bedroom door. A big red heart with the names Ashley and Andrew in the center."	t5_2t3t8	True
1346219157.0	z097i	I wish I knew where this man was now.. 	bbmamadrama	145	21	6	"I can't say I remember exactly how old I was but I was between 5-7 years old when this happened to me... I used to live on the fifth floor of this nasty looking apartment building. I guess it's nasty looking now - it was alright before, a lot of kids around to play with...

I used to get dropped off by my school bus and I would have to wait for my older brother to come home from school since he had the house key. I wasn't old enough to keep one yet. So one day, while I waited, I sat at the stairs looking out at the lake and I noticed an old man with a little girl, she must have been 2 years old. I was a pretty sociable kid so I ran down there because I wanted to meet the baby and play with her. I just remember her being so beautiful.

I found out where they lived and the granddad told me I could come play with her whenever I wanted; my initial thought was ""cool beans!""

Then one day I actually did go... They lived in the same building as me on the second floor. I knocked and he let me in, being real nice like he had been before. I asked where the baby was and he showed me to the room where she was just laying in bed sleeping. There was no one else in the apartment and since she was asleep, there was really no reason for me to stay so I began to say goodbye. 

He came up behind me and grabbed me by my waist, making a lewd comment about how small my waist was. He was so close to me I could smell the alcohol on his breath as he slobbered on the back of my neck. I was freaking out on the inside because he was pushing me towards the wall slowly. I managed to slip out of his reach and told him I had to go, I lied and promised I'd come back just so he'd let me go. I don't think he was going to try and keep me there because when I said that, he laughed at me. 

I opened the door and bolted out, running up the stairs to the fifth floor. 

Although I thought fast and managed to escape, to this day I wonder what the hell did this man do to that little girl? Did he try to molest her too? I regret not telling my parents about it until years later because I could have stopped him from hurting that little girl. 

I don't know. I regret it so much. :-\ "	t5_2t3t8	True
1343430143.0	x9tlb	Why I never go swimming any more...	KiraNinja	165	41	59	"So this was a long time ago, however I thought I should post it here regardless since I remember it quite well.

I think I was around 12 when this happened and I was on holiday with my family. My brother (2 years younger than me) and I decided to go swimming in this awesome indoor pool, and it was awesome, I always loved water and swimming but I don't like it so much any more. We had just gotten out of the pool and we went into the changing rooms which were unisex, I noticed a man standing around in a area where the cubicles were all empty which was strange because at first I thought he was waiting for someone, I can't remember too well what he looked like just that he was quite skinny and normal height. I proceeded into a cubicle and I noticed how he looked at me as I walked past, this didn't bother me at the time but anyway, I put my clothes down and locked the door, before I got changed I was putting my hair into a ponytail and looked down to see a head pop underneath the wall of the cubicle he must of been really stupid because it was super obvious and as a young girl I panicked, I didn't say a word and froze for a few seconds at him trying to adjust himself to see me properly, he must of not noticed I'd seen him, but I grabbed my stuff and booked it outta there, got changed in a cubicle as far away from him and alerted my mum, who attempted to go in to look for him but stupid me said ""don't worry about it mum"" and she said ""are you sure?? You should of kicked his head in"" and by god, 16 year old me now would have, well, I think I was stupid for not allowing my mum to go in and find him...

1343166358.0	x3gi8	The beginning of something very unhealthy.	woahlookihaveapillow	151	24	42	"Before I started college, I wasn't exactly ""popular"" with guys-- I don't think this is because I'm bad looking or anything, but rather that I've always been a tomboy and have easily fit in as ""one of the guys."" When I started school, I was used to being polite to guys and assuming that we would become fast friends. However, this very quickly blew up in my face.

There was a guy, Marvin, who happened to approach me at an outdoor concert during the first week of school. He was your typical nerd archetype-- acne prone, skinny, an odd way of carrying himself, and a clearly nervous, shaky voice when he spoke. He came behind me and said, without introducing himself, ""Those guys are talking about you."" I turned and didn't see any particular group paying attention to me, but I kind of laughed and shrugged the comment off and responded with some comment, but didn't want to talk to him further. Something about the way he was staring at me unnerved me, but I quickly forgot about this event. 

The next day, I was sitting at breakfast with one of my friends and the same boy, whose name I did not yet know, came and sat next to me without introducing himself. He sat, and did not talk, but listened to our conversation and we tried to include him as much as possible, both of us assuming that the other knew him. He got up and left, and we each asked the other what his name was and neither of us knowing. Once again, I shrugged this off as a nervous encounter during the first week of school.

After that, things started to get stranger. I would see him more often around campus, near where I was sitting in the dining hall, on my way to classes, but he never seemed to be there on purpose nor did he ever talk to me. However, some of my friends started to tell me that he often asked where I was if he saw them without me, even if they had never introduced themselves to him before. Naturally, I started to become a bit wary of his presence and hyper-aware of him.

A month or so passed (with this behavior continuing), and there was a small dance that was held for some of the first years. My friends and I go, hoping that it might be some fun and as I am dancing I spot him in the crowd. All girls are able to tell when a guy is watching them on the dance floor and trying to approach them, and I got this feeling from him so I naturally began to distance myself from him. Eventually, it got to the point where I walked off the dance floor in order to grab a snack. Suddenly, I felt a hand on my shoulder and I turned around to see him standing behind me, his body shaking and his face sweaty. 

""Can you talk to me outside?"" His voice shook and his grip tightened on my shoulder. 

Terrified, I quickly replied, ""No, about what?""

His voice sputtered it out, shaking even worse, ""About how crazy I am!""

I backed away and said ""No"" a dozen times, completely unnerved, and he scurried off outside, later going to talk to my friends, asking why I ""hate him"" and ""never want to talk to him,"" despite this being one of the first attempts of him ever speaking to me.


The story has gotten worse over the past two years, but I don't want to make this too long. However, it has gotten to the point where he has arrived in my room twice (despite me NEVER telling him where I live), writing me an anonymous (disturbing) love-poem online, multiple lengthy passive aggressive messages on facebook that have never received replies (and an eventual ""block""), multiple occasions where he would try to position himself in class so he can watch me, and him trying to ""befriend"" my friends and constantly ask them about me/about my whereabouts. 

TL;DR Typical stalking

1330539168.0	qblqp	Creepy guy while fishing (with video)	tr_morrison	144	17	42	"I regularly fish off of a small jetty on the river where I live with a friend. On this particular day, I went on my own as my mate was working. When I arrive, I see a young girl (later find out she is 14) sitting on the jetty, so I decide to fish off of the beach so as not to make her uncomfortable, but she waves me over onto the jetty anyway. Apparently she had seen me fish off there before and wanted some company.

As I'm setting my gear up, this guy in a uniform walks up onto the jetty wearing what looks to be a police uniform ([this is what your average Aussie cop looks like](http://www.peacebus.com/CyanideWatch/060718Police.jpg)) and starts talking to the girl in an official manner about someone who had been riding their dirtbike on the park grass, talking about ""apprehending"" him, etc. From the get go I can tell there's something not quite right about this guy.

A closer look at his uniform tells me he isn't actually a police officer, and his uniform in fact appears to be a Marine S.E.S. (state emergency service) uniform.

My friend arrives, and his conversation with the girl is turning out to be unintentionally hilarious. This is where I bring out my phone and start recording this [VIDEO](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0kXxW-VZFs&amp;list=UU5OidzhUYrccU2hn8FjcRcA&amp;feature=plcp).

The conversation turns more and more inappropriate, with my friend and I making a point to not interact with him outside of a couple remarks. At one point, after the guy on the dirt bike came back, and this guy (we'll call him Marine Officer Badass... MOB for short) tried to ""apprehend"" him, only to be told to ""go get fucked, cunt!"". MOB returns and appears to call the local police and file a report (throwing in bullshit claims of the guy doing burn outs and doughies, all of which never happened, the guy just peacefully drove away).

Then, suddenly, the guy decides *he* wants to fish as well. Off he goes, on his little push bike, meanwhile the girl chats with us and makes it clear she's creeped out by the guy. When he returns in his, quote, ""civvy clothes"", he proceeds to sit very close to the girl and fish with her, all the while she is making very audible hints that she doesn't feel safe with him, such as talking to my friend and I ""Please don't leave me here alone"".

The real creepy part is when she decided to leave, he also decided to leave and seemed to be of the impression that they would walk home together. She of course stuck around and talked to us, while he awkwardly and PAINFULLY slowly started walking his bike off and looking back regularly. Even stopping at times and staring at us.

Obviously, this wasn't going to turn well if we let her walk home on her own so we decided to walk her home to keep her safe from this guy. As we are parting ways at the end of her street, she gets a phone call from her mother.

Apparently, this guy, while her back was turned, has gone through her phone and taken her Mum's number, and has now *called* her Mum and told her that her daughter is walking home with two pedophiles.

WTF.

Turns out this guy is NOT with the S.E.S. and just dresses up like this to feel important, or something.

Ended up posting this video to facebook, and find out this guy was caught with fireworks/explosives on his porch, which exploded while a group of children were there, causing a young girl to be burnt severely.

The fact that this guy was so *brazen* about **hitting on** this girl right in front of us makes me think he might have actually done this with other girls. Very worrying, so much so that we make it a point to go fishing even when we're not too keen on it, so that girl doesn't get bloody raped or something. Her parents don't seem to be the greatest.

Sorry if this isn't really LNM worthy but it's an ongoing saga and I will update as we get more creepy stuff."	t5_2t3t8	True
1328844194.0	piu0c	[MY] Milwaukee Gas Station Encounter	C4l2LY	151	24	38	"Let me start off by saying that this story is no where near as scary as the others ones that can be found in this subreddit, but I thought maybe some of you would get a kick out of it.



I remember it was winter; winter nights always seem the darkest in Wisconsin. My boyfriend and I had just finished a day full of winter festivities, you know, ice-skating and hot chocolate drinking, things of that genre. Since we had driven all over downtown Milwaukee for the majority of the day, it came as no surprise that my car was in need of some gas, and fast. Not quite knowing the east side of Milwaukee that well, I trusted my boyfriend when he told me that the BP gas station on the corner of North and Farwell was a “nice” one. As we pulled into the gas station I realized he was right, the gas station looked brand new and the neighborhood seemed rather nice as well. As I was filling my car, my boyfriend and I began to joke about the encounters we had throughout the day, laughing and talking rather loudly. Suddenly, we here this loud pitched scream. Startled we looked in the direction of the noise and saw a man running like a “bat out of hell” toward us. The closer he got the more I could make out that his screams were actually shouts for help. “HELLLLLLLLP! HELLLLP MEEEE!” He shouted so loudly that even the echo of his words sounded just as loud as his previous shout. 



He continued running just as fast, if not faster than he was before, towards the gas station. As he passed my boyfriend and I, he looked directly at me and shouted, “THEY ARE AFTER ME! YOU HAVE TO HELP ME!” I remember him being an average looking guy. He was skinny, had blonde hair, and looked like he was in his mid 20s, but the thing that really got me were his eyes. They were wild, yet somewhat glazed over, and they looked like they were about to bulge out of his sockets. As he disappeared into the gas station I looked over to my boyfriend and told him that we were going in there to see “what was up.” After I had finished putting my gas into my car, my boyfriend and I entered the gas station and found the crazed man hiding behind the isle that had the chips and the Slim Jims. 



“Are you okay?” I asked him. 


“NO!” He replied, still yelling. “YOU HAVE TO HELP ME. THEY ARE AFTER ME!” 


“Who? Who is after you?” I asked


“Uhhh…” he hesitated this time. “Four guys. I was just robbed outside my house. They are probably still waiting there for me. Help.” He was no longer yelling, but almost smiling.


“Did you call the cops?” I asked the man. I quickly glanced at the cashier; he disapprovingly shook his head at me, and mouthed the word ‘LEAVE.’


“No, no, no. I can’t.” The man said. “I just need you to give me a ride to the Twisted Fork.” This is when my boyfriend decided to step in.


“No way man. You need to call the cops.” He said, before turning to me. “Let’s go.”



As we left the gas station I asked him why he decided to speak up. He told me that the Twisted Fork was right down the block and that it would take the man literally less than a minute to run to it. He was convinced the man was out to murder us. I laughed and brushed it off as him being a chicken. As we got into the car, I looked into my review mirror. The man was now outside of the gas station, smiling and waving. As I started my car I saw the man raise his hand to his neck and glide his index finger across it, his smile never wavering. I hightailed it out of there as fast as I could. To this day I have still not told my boyfriend what I saw; I hate admitting he is right. I am not sure what that man would have done if I would have let him in my car, but I sure it would have involved some type of pain."	t5_2t3t8	True
1365926352.0	1cbf66	Bus Stop Detour	Breetastic	155	31	12	"Here's a simple little tale to start off here. I haven't been lurking for long here but I enjoy this subreddit. I intend to share my creepy stories along with everyone else.


For a preface, I am 21 years old, 4'11 and 107 lbs. I'm petite as fuck. This happened when I was about... 17 or 18.


There was a period of time that I would head to Capital Community College in Hartford, CT just to hang with friends during the summer. We'd sit in the cafe or the gameroom and play YGO cards and fighting games.


I usually didn't go home 'til around 9 or 10. It was pretty dark by then. The CT transit buses would line up in front of the Old State House, and my friends and I would go on our individual buses, splitting ways.


There are 3 different bus stops around my house that I can take to head Downtown. At the time I only knew of one, the Vine Street route. Vine Street straddles Love Lane, and the surrounding area is mostly forest. Further up Vine is an old folks home and a rehab/mental clinic I believe. The bus stops at the intersection of these streets, and continues up Vine.


I had to walk up Love Lane a bit before I reached the residential area that was somewhat close-by.


At the time, I was a fearless little tomboy who wasn't afraid of much. The bus, with a few other people on it, and myself, were driving down Vine with no issue. There was a certain fellow on the bus, who looked a bit disheveled and all, but I didn't pay him any mind. I mean, it's Hartford, for god's sake. Nonetheless, he was on the bus too.


My stop came, I pulled the little indicator, and got off. This guy also got off as well, he took the back exit, I took the front.


I minded my business, told the bus driver ""Thank you, have a good evening,"" and went on my way... I walked up the slowly inclining hill, and hear the bus beginning to slowly pull off. The man was behind me, and was going in the same direction I was.


I have short legs, but I walk pretty fast, but still, I couldn't shake this fucking feeling off...


Anyone who's taking the buses in Hartford knows the routes, but generally the Vine Street bus is only supposed to go on Vine Street. The bus driver turned onto Love Lane headed our direction, and stops next to me. The guy behind me starts shouting for attention, not sure if it was at me, or the bus.


""I'll take you where you need to go, I don't trust that guy."" The bus driver gives me a look, and I climb onto the bus, giving a simple thank you.


The guy is now waving and shouting at the bus, and I can't help but look, and wonder... What if I just kept walking? What if the bus driver didn't decide to drive me home?


He goes up Love Lane and turns onto my street, and drops me off in front of my complex, before heading onto Tower Ave and heading towards Vine Street to continue his route.


I guess the only thing I have to say is don't be a girl and walk in a wooded area, cause shit WILL HAPPEN. Obviously enough from all these other stories on here...


TL;DR version: Creepy fellow might have possibly got to me if it weren't for the valiant efforts of a bus driver going off the route for me. The end.

1343241450.0	x5792	[Comp] No one's outside	firef1y	150	26	13	"I feel like my life might be a span of creepiness, but here is something that happened to my mother and me a few years ago when I was visiting from college.


It was spring break, and I flew down to South Florida to see my mom. One night I had come home a bit early from hanging out with friends, around midnight. It was raining pretty heavily, and the power had started flickering on and off, so I decided it would be best if I just went to bed since I couldn't watch TV or go online. My mom also decided to go to bed as well, but she is an insomniac, and while trying to fall asleep she heard noises coming from our backyard. 


She looked through the blinds, but could see only darkness. She went into my room and woke me up and told me that she thought there was something going on in our backyard. Our backyard is fenced off with a screened patio, which is locked with a screen door. We both went to a window and looked through the blinds and I could see these really faint shadows, but it was so dark. I decided to flick on the lights to our backyard, as I flipped the switched on and off I realized the power was totally gone, and that meant our alarm system was also disabled.


I pressed my ear against the glass while still hiding behind the blinds with my mom. I heard a clinking sound that you would hear if you rattled an empty aluminum can and the coke tab had fallen in. I thought I heard voices, but I couldn't be sure because of the rain. After sitting at the window for a few minutes my mom and I decided that maybe it was just our imaginations, although neither of us wanted to go outside and check it out for sure. 


""There is probably no one outside,"" I said to my mom. I could see she was really worried (we are both petite women). We both went to our respective rooms, and a few minutes later I heard a loud bang. The sound was so loud it echoed through the house. Without thinking, I immediately jumped out of bed and ran towards the window that overlooks our backyard. I ran so fast that I slipped onto the tiled floor as I came up onto the window. I pushed the blinds away, only to see a faint crack on the window that was spreading quickly through the glass. I realized immediately that the glass was cracking and it was probably going to shatter. 


At this point my mom was at the window with two hurricane flashlights. We shined them through the cracked, but still in-tacked, glass only to see the patio door swinging wildly outside, but no one was out there. 


After the storm subsided we called the cops. We all went out to the patio door to inspect it and sure enough the lock had been tampered with and the cops said it looked like there were several people out there by the look of the grass and bushes (the bushes looked like they were trampled on.) 


As for the glass, the cops said it didn't look like someone hit it with anything because the glass was cracked in a million pieces, but it didn't shatter. There was also no sign of an impact. 


After the cops left, my mom and I reasoned the loud bang could have been of the glass snapping because of the pressure change from the storm and maybe that sound freaked out whoever was trying to break in.  Very surreal.

1338567652.0	ufsay	It could have been me. 	korukyu	142	18	25	"4 years ago, I lived in an apartment building in the university area of Pittsburgh, PA. The walls were thin, the hot water was sporadic, and the residents were unfriendly, but it provided a short commute to classes and it was fairly cheap for the area. 

It was, however, one of the few buildings in the area that was *not* primarily occupied by students, which was quite strange. Non-students tend to keep different hours than those who have classes and office hours to attend, and it was because of that, I believe, I ran into trouble.

It was maybe 8 or 9 pm in mid-May when my studies were interrupted by loud banging on my door. I didn't have a chain on my door (something that I've since insisted upon in every subsequent building in which I have resided), so rather than opening the door, I called, ""Yes? What do you need?"" through it. 

From the other side, I heard a man's voice. ""KEEP IT DOWN, YOU BITCH. IT'S LATE AND YOU'RE MAKING TOO MUCH GODDAMN NOISE."" 

I turned the music off and apologized; it wasn't even that loud, but as stated before, the walls were thin and I definitely didn't want to make any of my neighbors angry...or at least angrier than they already were. 

But turning the music off didn't make him go away. He kept yelling, mostly incomprehensible ranting interspersed with the pounding on the door. But I was able to make out ""OPEN THE DOOR"" and ""LET ME IN"" amongst all of the crazy, which made me reach for my phone. 

He stayed out there for another 2-3 minutes maybe; I didn't check the time, as I was too busy trying to decide whether to call the police or not. I finally heard his heavy footsteps wander away, then a door slammed near the end of the hall. Could he really hear my music from all the way down there, I wondered?

From that point out, I only played music through my headphones, but I probably didn't have to do so. One week later, I came home from an incredibly difficult Statistics test to find police swarming my building. There was crime scene tape on the 4th floor -- the floor on which I lived. 

Since I never looked out, I don't know if it was the same guy that came to my door. But Terrence Andrews had stabbed another resident to death. He apparently had told his mental health physician that he was going to kill somebody, and then did exactly that. If my stats professor wasn't so intent on having late-night exams (seriously, starting at 9pm? who does that?), it could have been me.

1371956818.0	1gw21j	Real life man under the bed story	hoyahoya	155	30	30	"So, after reading the trending story of a man with a knife under the bed, I felt I should write this story which happened to a girl who attended my high school and was two years my junior. I don't want to reveal too much info, and I'm not sure if this was in newspapers or not, but it occurred about two to three years ago in Charlotte, NC. This is no wife's tail. 

Our story begins as Daphne was going to bed one night during a Charlotte winter, which can get unpleasantly cold. Daphne tells that she remembers being restless during her sleep, and that she remembers groggily waking up and pulling her covers up, which had gotten displaced several times throughout the night. 

At one point, Daphne wakes up shivering as her blanket had yet again maneuvered it's way to her waist. Without moving or opening her eyes, Daphne lay in silence wondering why she would keep kicking her blanket off in her sleep when she felt her blanket being *pulled towards the foot of her bed*.

Terrified, Daphne opens her eyes to a man staring at her intently while pulling away at the covers. Immediately, Daphne jumps up screaming and runs out of the room to her parents. 

The man escaped through the window and was never found. Police were called and discovered beer cans and a knife *under her bed*, giving them reason to believe that the man would frequently watch her at night. Nobody knows if the man was planning on raping her, merely liked watching her sleep, or was having himself a nice wank while he watched her. Given southern sensibilities, the family would probably not mention if he were masturbating while he watched her, but it's a possibility."	t5_2t3t8	True
1352025763.0	12lvzc	"""You a virgin?"""	ladyaud	162	37	27	"I just discovered this place and thought I would go ahead and share the story of what happened to me in my senior year of high school. 

A bit of background: my sophomore year, I moved across town. However, I was very shy and socially awkward so I didn't want to switch schools and leave what friends I did have. It would have affected my school work and my mental facilities, as I was depressed at the time and actively seeing a therapist and psychiatrist. Therefore, I had to start riding the city bus to and from school as I was out of district. 

Fast forward to my senior year. Still riding the city bus daily. On a normal day, I would be out of the house by 7:02 and at the bus stop by 7:13. I was very precise and finicky and would become very anxious if I was a minute late. It was not a very far walk. Down the street, take a left onto a half street, a right onto a half street, and across the main road. Until that point, however, it's pretty deserted. 

It was early spring. The sun was shining but it was crisp outside, so I had my sweater. I'm about fifty feet out of my front door and I notice a young man about one hundred feet in front of me, walking slowly. As I said before, I was very shy. I didn't want to overtake him and have to acknowledge him in any way. I bend down, re-tie my shoe, and dilly-dally a bit. When I stand up, I notice he has turned around and stopped, looking at me. I begin walking and keep my head down. Soon, I'm near him and he starts chatting me up. I'm getting a bad vibe and I feel extremely uncomfortable. The conversation was as follows:

""Hey, didn't you give me your number the other day?""

""No. You have the wrong person, sorry.""

""Yeah, it was you. You were on that street over there with your friend."" 

""Sorry, no.""

He asks me for my number, and I tell him I don't have a phone (all the whole trying to hide the bulge in my pocket that was my phone.) I should mention now that he absolutely reeks of marijuana, which makes me feel sick. No idea why. At this point, we're walking past a field that has tall grass growing most of the year. I'm tense and trying to be polite but firm, and failing miserably. 

""Want to smoke with me?"" He asks. 

""No thanks. I don't do any of that.""

""You a virgin?"" He asks. This details me completely. I stutter for a moment before saying yes. While this is the truth, I was weighing the consequences of each. ""Why? You're fine, girl. Thick in all the right places. I can take your virginity. I live right there. Come on, baby. We can smoke and fuck.""

At this point, I'm contemplating running home and staying there, but I'm almost to the main road which is very busy. He still tries to get me to come with him, but now my replies are simply ""No."" I cross the street and sit down at the bus stop bench and he walks into an apartment complex behind me. After a few minutes, the bus pulls up. Right before I get on, he comes out of the complex and asks me the time. I tell him, get on the bus, and hope that he doesn't follow me. 

Luckily, he didn't and I never saw him again. Due to my issues, that was one f the scariest moments in my life even though nothing really happened. I apologize for the wall of text, this was strangely therapeutic and turned out much longer than I had wanted. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1350244943.0	11h361	Guys, shouting at girls from across the parking lot is not the way to meet a decent lady.	so0ks	161	36	33	"About a month or so after I turned twenty, I caught a really bad stomach virus. With no mommy to take care of my sick self, I drove out to the grocery which was located with in the outdoor outlet mall I worked at. I was going to pick up some Gatorade and soup and papers from work. Parked my car in the grocery's parking lot and started walking over to the mall to my work when I start hearing this guy shouting. It took me a bit, but I finally heard that he was saying, ""HEY! YO EXCUSE ME!"" I look around, and realize that there's nobody else but me and this guy standing with his friend shouting at *me* from clear across the parking lot. ""COME OVER HERE FOR A SECOND!""

I start thinking, ""What in the fuck??"" and just continue on to my store with the guy still shouting out to me from across the lot. I farted around there longer than necessary, and when I finally came back to walk to the grocery, no sign of the guy. Right as I walk by the Rite-Aide next to the grocery, that same guy walks out. ""Hey, you in high school?""

""No, get the fuck out of my way.""

Being a little wierded out, I took my sweet ass time in the store getting my soup, and I even took a peek out the windows to see if he was out there. When finally I leave, I think he's left, only to have this guy pop out from behind one of the columns outside. He tells me to have a good day, and I ignore him and continue to book it back to my car as he made some innuendos to his friends about me.

Make it to my car, and, as I go to close the door, a hand shoots out and stops me. I turn and see that this dude fucking followed me to my car. He tells me, ""Hey, my name's Truth."" The shit? He proceeds to badger me, holding onto my door so I can't close it, asking me my name, where I'm from, if I've got a boyfriend and asking if I want to go out that night, which I shot down right away with my sick excuse. After all my one word answers, goodbyes and trying to pull the door shut, he asks me for my number. I snapped at him, ""I'm not giving that to you.""

""Well, you know, I'm new around here. I was thinking you could show me around.""

""There's not much to see.""

""Listen, I'm not a bad guy and blah blah blah."" Yeah. A guy named ""Truth"" that followed me to my car and preventing me from closing my door isn't sketchy. At all. I finally was able to get him away from my car, and leave, and I haven't heard or seen this dude since. I told my co-workers what happened later when I finally was able to go back to work and got a bunch of exclamations of ""OMG! I would have called the cops! alsdfjaewijl~!"" I've had guys shout at me from across parking lots before, asking me how I'm doing, if I've got a boyfriend, so I didn't pay too much mind. But fuck! He followed me to my car after I ignored him and was short and fairly rude to him; you think I'm interested? Guys. This is not the way to try and meet a girl. Seriously."	t5_2t3t8	True

   I am a 28yr old mom of two who resides in NJ. I walk my kids to school every morning at either 7:30am or 7:45am. I can choose 3 different paths to reach their school. I switch up all the time as I'm naturally paranoid.

   I just dropped off my kids and was walking home when a man walked up to me. I have seen this man before and he set off my spidey sense. He walked up to me started akwardly flirting. I sternly shot him down (crazy doesn't understand polite) and walked off. The nutball grabbed my arm and started dragging me! He was reaching in his pocket so I freaked. I looked him in the face (definitly wasn't looking in the eyes I'm a easy read) and matched his crazy. I screamed at the top of my lungs ""WHAT YOU WANT THIS DICK! DO YOU WANT THIS DICK?"" Dude ran off. I called the police, gave a decription and wanted to be contacted if he was caught. Nothing so far.

I know your like yeah right my ass. I grew up in Hudson County and loved exploring NY. Me and my friends have a million creep plans in place that one just jumped out first lol. I also carry a taser and mase but when he reached in his pocket  I just reacted.

1344360871.0	xtzlu	Listen to your instincts. 	challengereality	152	26	16	"When I first subbed to Let’sNotMeet, I felt I didn’t have any noteworthy stories. But some of the posts on here have jogged my memory… 

My first year of high school, my locker was in a main hallway, right next to the first floor girls’ bathroom. As a big theater nerd, I usually stayed after school for rehearsal. My routine didn’t vary much: when the last bell of the day rang, I’d go to my locker, get my books, and wait for the kids taking the bus to clear out so I could use the bathroom in relative peace. 

The hall monitor assigned to this hall was the new female field hockey coach, Coach Bren. Coach Bren was a tall, intimidating woman. Every day, once the buses had departed, Coach Bren would come into the girls’ bathroom and check around. I’d usually pass her on my way in or out of the restroom, or I’d hear her come in while I was in a stall. It struck me as odd- why would she need to patrol the bathroom after the school day had ended? As far as I knew, none of the other bathrooms in the school were checked at this time. I chalked it up to an overachieving faculty member taking her duty as “enforcer of the peace” very seriously. Although I saw Coach Bren almost every day, she never gave anything other than a nod of acknowledgement. She rarely made eye contact. It was a little weird, her just walking into the bathroom, looking around. Checking under the stalls. I’ve never been a skittish or nervous person, so I berated myself for even giving her behavior a second thought. Regardless, I listened to my instincts and tried to book it out of there every time she showed up. Or used a different bathroom. 

Fast forward a year. My friend calls me up to tell me that Coach Bren had been charged with sexually abusing a 15 year-old female student at a school she’d previously worked at. The abuse had gone on for several months, after which she quit her job and got a new one- at my school. She was arrested and later convicted with second-degree sexual assault and a few other things (she actually was released from prison recently, I believe). 

I always wonder if her reasons for checking the bathroom after school were more sinister than even I had originally suspected.

1371824314.0	1gsmky	What is he do- ooooh. OH!	crazy_slop_jocky	152	28	21	"So this is the one memorable creepy encounter I've had.  It happened in a quiet suburb, in my childhood home, from my brightly lit room. 

I'm in high school at the time, maybe 16, finishing some homework.  It's fairly late, everyone's asleep and I'm in my room on the top floor.  I should have been asleep an hour ago and my eyes need a break from my computer screen.  I stare out the window but don't see much more than my reflection.  I turn back to my computer but something catches my eye.  I press my face to the glass to get a good look and I see it.  

In my driveway is a strange car.  In the strange car is a strange man.  His interior lights are on and I can sort of make out his face.  He has sandy hair, a beige shirt, he's maybe 30 and he seems to be sort of leaning over to the passenger side.  I look away for a second, confused more than scared.  I think maybe he's lost and pulled in to get off the street.  Maybe he was reaching over to his glove to get a map.  I turn out my lights so I can better spy on this weirdo and every few seconds I press my face against the glass to see if he's still there, which he is.  In the same position.  Fidgeting.  

My eyes finally adjusted to the low light and it dawns on me what he's doing.  I reel away from the window.  I realize he isn't looking for a map, he's leaning over so he can see me better from the top of my driveway.  He isn't wearing a beige shirt, he has no shirt on at all.  Or pants.  Or underwear.  His twitching is him touching himself.  His lights are on because he wants me to see him do it.  I realize you can see at least my shoulders up from where he's sitting.  I realize I'm not wearing a shirt.  

I can't really see below his waist thanks to his steering wheel but it's still really weird.  I have no idea if it's something I should wake someone up for or call 911 about or what I'd say if I did either.  I put on a shirt and go downstairs.  Thankfully my mom is already up and at the front door, which saves me an awkward conversation.  She looks like she's trying to see his licence plate number when I stand next to her.  I see him still staring up at my room and get a bit of a shiver.  I tell her I think that guy might be naked, I leave out that it took me 5 minutes of staring to figure that out.  I also leave out why he's naked.  She agrees and shoos me away from the door, passing me the phone she was clutching.  I guess she was thinking about calling the police but instead she bursts through the front door striding right towards his car and screaming.  He sees her in a second and speeds off before she's even close.  His interior light still on and still buck naked.  

Nothing really comes of it.  I go back to my room and she calls the cops and describes the car and the man.  They say they'll be on the lookout but there's nothing to really do about it.  It's pretty uncomfortable and we have a bit of a weird laugh about whether he drove home completely naked or stopped to put on pants.  In the end it was pretty strange but harmless.  I barely ever remember it but when I do I cringe at how naive I was.

1364440306.0	1b5m2z	Week of Terror - Brace yourselves, this was a 3-pager typed...	CustosClavium	153	31	50	"When I was about 17-18 years old, my family and I moved to a rural farmhouse that sat, isolated, on 700+ acres of land in Chester, South Carolina. It was a sweet deal: $550 rent each month (2002-2004).

[**Here is a handy map!**](http://i.imgur.com/FQ7exBa.jpg)

At the time, it was me, my dad, my mom, and my dog Pepper - a flatcoated retriever of about 19 years of age. Ol' Pepper was getting hard of hearing, and mother's Day was coming up, so I got my mom a German Shepherd pup for the occasion.

About a month later, right around Father's Day (Day 0), my dad decided to leave my mom. My Dad sat me down and told me he was leaving, and left a note for my mom, and left, saying he'd come back in a few days to get his stuff. The next day (Day 1), as he was leaving, the GS pup ran out in front of his truck and was hit. He suffered a broke puppy nose, and was put on antibiotics and had to sleep in the laundry room while he healed (our dogs were outside dogs).

The next day (Day 2) I was coming hom from school/work, a 30 minute drive, getting me home around 8:30pm. Our house sat on a looooong paved country road, and about a mile from the main road, there was our house sitting back about 150-200 yards from the road. About 75 yard from our drive way was another road that came out at the road in front of our house, and was at a slight angle. So, as I came home, I noticed there was an older white truck just parked there, no lights on, and a guy just sitting in the front seat; the truck was basically positioned to look right at our house. As I passed, he flashed his lights. I thought *”WTF...*”, floored it, and got home. 

I explained the situation to my mom, and she said it was probably nothing. So, Day 3 comes. I go to school like normal. I leave school for my job at the library like normal. I get off at 8:00pm and head home. I turn down the long country road. For shits and giggles, I start flashing my high/low beams as I get closer to my house...and then I notice the white truck is back and I nearly shit a brick. There he is, sitting in the truck again. I get home and tell my mom, and now she’s concerned. She calls up the Chester Co Sheriff’s and asks for someone to come check it out. It takes them no less than 30 minutes to respond, and the officer can’t even figure out where our house is. He calls and says “I think I am in front of your house, do you see me?” and my mom says “Yes! I see you! Waving a flashlight, right?” And he says “No ma’am...I’m not doing that...” Holy. Shit. My mom and I immediately run from the front porch and back inside, because who the hell is doing that?!

About 15 minutes later, the sheriff *really* finds our house, and mentions that he didn’t see any truck where we said it was. He then says “Well, even if there is someone parked up there on the road, there’s really nothing we can do about it unless a crime is being committed. But do call us again if anyone is on your property.” Uh huh. Thanks.

Day 4: My mom has now gone to Lowe’s and bought those cheap little magnetized alarms that you can stick to windows/doors, and that chirp if said window/door is opened. These go everywhere. She also buys and installs motion-activated floodlights all over the house. She calls my aunt who lives in a neighboring county, and she comes over and parks her bigass car in front of the house and brings her revolver. That night, my Aunt slept in my room while I slept with my mom in her bed. I didn’t have to work that day, so I came home right after school and we didn’t notice the white truck parked at the road, because eventually it gets dark...

We sit in the front room, which has a huge picture window that looks out toward the main road. The old dog is asleep on the porch, and we have the pup in the living room, who insists on sitting *right* in my lap despite how he has been growing like a weed. Then, my pup just gets still. His ears perk up. He looks *right in the direction* of where the truck normally parks, and lets out a blood-freezing, low growl more intimidating that I had ever heard from an adult dog. I mean, it’s *scary*. He just keeps staring right out the window and growling in the direction of where the truck would be.

My mom and aunt look at each other, and I am told to go to my mom’s room with the dog. At this point, the flood light is on toward the front of the house, and my old dog is on the porch snoozing away because she couldn’t hear an atomic blast in her age. The curtains are drawn, and I am in my mom’s room. The floodlight *behind* the house is now on (mom’s room is on that side of the house, I see it from her window). My mom and aunt are basically now walking around the house making sure shit is locked. My mom and comes into the room and sits on the bed with me and the pup, who is still growling sporadically and whining.

My aunt is in the hall between mom’s bedroom and the living room, and then we hear it. BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP. Someone has tried to open a window or a door in the house. Pup is barking. My aunt is yelling “*I HAVE A LOADED GUN AND I WILL USE IT IF I HAVE TO.*” Nothing else happens that night. The alarm is shut off, and we’re “safe” for the night. We call the cops, but again, they take forever to get there and they see nothing.

On Day 5, we are on guard big time. We can’t really go anywhere for the night for some reason (don’t remember), but we’re like hyper vigilant. On this night, nothing really happens. I come home from school/work, there’s no truck, flood lights don’t go off, alarms are silent, dogs are calm. Day 6 goes off without a hitch as well. My mom and I figure the guy got the message with the alarms, lights, my crazy ass armed aunt, and the cops coming out a second time (we assumed he was aware somehow). 

So Day 7 rolls around. We’re starting to get back to normal. We think maybe there was just a deer in the yard setting off the lights, because hey, it is the country. Maybe the air pressure changed and made the door move enough to set the alarm off. Maybe the guy in the truck was just a local drunk hanging out away from home, or maybe it was some guy and a lady needing a secluded place to screw around. No biggie, right?

This night, I come home from school/work...and there’s the truck, only this time, no one is in it. I race home, pushing my shitty little Geo Metro down that long gravel drive way as fast as I can safely drive. I run in the house. “Mom. He’s back. And he ain’t in the cab!.” My mom says “Go to your room, and get enough clothes for tonight, and meet me in the den as soon as possible.” Our den was the room next to the carport. I meet her there in like 2 minutes flat. In the meantime, she has locked all the doors/windows, drawn all curtains/blinds, and turned on all the lights in the house. This was the first night we let young pup back outside to be with the old dog, and both were spending most of their time on/near the front porch.

“Listen, I am going to the car. You watch from the window, and when I have the car running, run out and get in. Pull the door shut behind you, but just get in.” I express worry about the dogs, but she says they are dogs and will be ok. She takes my bag, gets in the car, and starts it. I run out, pulling the locked door shut behind me, and my ass hasn’t even hit the seat completely before she has that thing reversing our of the car port at about 30mph. We take off flying down the driveway.

We get to the end of the driveway where we have to turn left to get onto the road. The driveway is lined with big oak trees and pecan trees, and a few stumps. We are about 30 feet from the road, when I see something dodge behind a large stump. I say nothing. My mom accelerates the fuck up, turns left without even stopping for safety, and high tails it to the highway. About a mile from home she says “Um...did you...notice anything?” and I say “YES! You saw him too?!” She says she did, but didn’t want to scare me.

That night we slept in a motel about 45 minutes from home. My mom called the sheriffs, who again saw nothing and didn’t seem to care. No one could take us in. My mom miraculously found a house for rent in the paper the next day. She called the landlord and said what happened, so we were released form our old lease and were lucky enough to move in to the new house (in the city) the next day. We got our stuff from the country house during daylight for a few days after, and left behind a lot of stuff that we just couldn’t get.

To this day, we have no idea who the white truck belonged to or what the hell he wanted. He seemed determined to get to us though. I still get chills thinking about it (not to mention typing it out!)

**EDIT**: Added a map w/key places noted; no way to tell where this is since I removed the pertinent info (road names, zip code). Also: Boy, are my distances off! That driveway is longer that I remember!!

1355191088.0	14n24n	My mother's creeper. 	FatGrandaddy	146	22	18	"About 4 or 5 years ago, my mom started dating this guy Mark. I never met Mark because it wasn't a very long relationship at all. My mom had found out he was still married (going through a divorce, but still married at the time). My mom got pretty pissed off when she found out and ended it with Mark. This, however, pissed Mark off and he began sending her several letters that were aggressive, threatening, and just flat out rude. My mom started to realize that something wasn't right with this guy and told one of her good guy friends, who confronted the guy. After that the letters stopped and he had no further communication with my mom.

For New Years last year my mom, her cousin, and her boyfriend went to the beach to watch fireworks. I was left alone at home, so I just had a party of my own with a few of my friends. My friends however were shitty house guests and pretty much trashed my house. I had to practically babysit them all night, then take them all home about 5 am. When I got back from taking them home I had to clean my entire house before my mom got back. After the house was clean I passed out, but was awoken a couple hours later to my mother who seemed pretty upset. I thought to myself ""Shit, she knows!"". But instead of freaking out over the house she was freaking out over some texts she had recieved.

The texts were really creepy; They were going on and on saying things like ""beware the evil that lives next door"" and stuff about a little girl and the devil. The texts weren't how a normal person would text either. Probably the creepiest part was that the text was worded as if someone centuries ago had sent it, like an old timey riddle of some kind. The end of the text had an address, that google told us was a few houses down. So my mother was creeped the fuck out and called the cops. 

After talking with her about the text messages, the cops decided to go to the house addressed in the texts. Turns out Mark's ex wife and daughter had just moved in the house in an effort to get away from him. The ex told the cops that he was crazy and they had a restraining order against him. Not only was he not supposed to know where they lived, but he also wasn't supposed to know where we lived (seeing as my mom never told him where she lived and never brought him around). I'm not a 100% sure what the cops did about the situation, but I'm pretty sure they put a warrant out on him for violating the restraining order.

Until a few weeks ago, we had forgotten about Mark and his creepy shit. That is until I went to the mailbox and saw there was a package for my mom. I put it on her bed so she would see it when she got out of the shower. I went back to watching TV, when my mom barges in and says ""The cops are coming, I'm sick of this fucker and his little games."", then walks back into her room. Confused, I follow her back to her room asking what the hell was going on. She hands me the book that was in the package and says ""Remember that crazy guy, Mark?"". I replied ""yeah"", then looked down at the book titled 'The Resurrection'. I asked how she knew it was him, she told me that he had made up a fake address that was along the lines of ""123 Stethescope Lane."" (He had given my mom, who is a nurse, a stethescope as a gift) And on the inside of the envelope it said ""save (his daughter's name)"".

The cop told my mom that there was nothing that could really be done, since there was no real evidence it was him and left. My mom walked to the ex wife's house to speak with her about it. The ex told my mom how he had also sent copies of the book to her, her mother, her attorney's wife, and his attorney's wife. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1348281873.0	10a5if	We had a near miss in Rome		150	28	23	"I spent the last school year studying in Europe, and couldn’t really afford to fly back and forth to the States for Christmas, so a couple of my friends and I decided to travel around a bit. Our very last stop before we went back to our home city was in Rome. My friends and I were in a nice hostel in a kind of seedy part of the city by the train station, but it honestly wasn’t a place that I felt threatened since I lived in a similar area, and the other girl I was in was from even worse. The hostel was an apartment in a building with a little garden area out front and a gate separating it from the street. 

We spent a few days touring around the sights, never having a problem with people in the area but we always kept our eyes open since Rome has a bit of a reputation. By the third day the other girl and I needed and break from the history and decided to go on a pub crawl. We decided to ditch the guy we were traveling with (he ended up being a much less pleasant person then we had originally thought), and went off to get a taste of the Roman nightlife. Part way through the pub crawl, a small group of us broke off and decided to go with a couple of people who helped run the pub crawl but weren’t working that night. 

I honestly have no idea where we went. We went from bar to bar, enjoying a more local crowd as opposed to the usually empty places pub crawls are wont to go. My friend and I made friends with one of the guys leading it who was African and when a racist bouncer (SS lightening tattoos on the back of his shaved head) wouldn’t let us into a sitting area where everyone else we knew was we decided to bounce. 

So, we left. At this point it was my friend and I, with the African tour leader guy and an Aussie who just happened to tail along since the asshole bouncer was being a dick to him too. We walked around the city for a while, chatting and what not and eventually we decided it was time to call it a night. The local guy left first since he lived nearby, and we walked back with the Australian guy who told us a super cute story of how he’s in love with a girl back home. We eventually got to the point where we split off from him. He offered to walk us the rest of the way, but we politely declined thinking that we were fine since there was two of us. Wrong. So very, very wrong. 

We parted in high spirits. It was about 4 in the morning. We were still buzzed from drinking all night and we were discussing all the crazy things that had happened. So, we got to the gate and my friend started having trouble figuring which key was supposed to open it. I leaned again the fence while she fiddled with the key ring, but I was snapped back into stone cold sober reality when I saw something dark moving quickly out of the corner of my eye from the direction from which we had just come. I could tell from the silhouette it was a man, he had his hood pulled over and he was sprinting straight for us at full speed. 

Just at that moment, my friend managed to get the gate open. Without a moment to spare I shoved her through it, threw myself in and pulled it shut. Not even a second later the man was at the gate. He shook it with all his might but he never took his eyes off me. He spoke to us, but I can’t remember even what language he was speaking; I was so scared he could have been speaking English and that wouldn’t have computed. I just kept backing away and repeating “NO! NO!”, praying that the gate would hold. 

My friend and I triple checked every single lock that night before we went to sleep. She told me that she hadn’t even seen the guy coming at us, and we shuddered at the thought of what may have happened if I hadn’t reacted. I find it amazing that the creepiest moment of my life so far happened in about 15 seconds but take this as a reminder to always keep your wits about you when you’re traveling. Bad things happen, even when you’re having the time of your life.

1341187650.0	vwepn	The bartenders at The Muse	dextorsamson	149	25	22	"Shortly after my best friend, Charlie, and I moved to Nashville a couple of years ago, we met some awesome people (three of whom were in a band together) and became instant friends. Before Charlie and I were employed, we made it a point to go to all of the band's shows, including a couple that were at The Muse.

My first time there, one of the bartenders took a liking to me. He followed me around everywhere and while I was initially too drunk to care, it started to weird me out after a while. I started asking Charlie to accompany me to the bathroom and watch the door, as he couldn't go inside the women's bathroom on account of his penis.

I would notice the guy look at me from afar, but he left me alone until we were getting ready to leave. He followed us out to my car and was rambling about music and whatever the hell else. I couldn't get him to stop talking and he was holding my door open. I was finally able to get him to shut up by telling him to give me his number. I sped off shortly after. 

That bartender, however, was a ray of motherfucking sunshine compared to the skinhead bartender. I guess this guy had gotten too drunk or maybe the stalker barkeep told him some fantastical story about how I gave him the best footjob of his life in the parking lot. Who knows? Either way, I was headed to the bar during a performance when the bald, old man cornered me.

He touches my hair and tells me how sexy black women are. He then shows me all of his swastika tattoos and regales me with stories of how he used to beat up black men with his friends during his time in the KKK. ""But that was the past,"" he says. Then, he decides that I am surely aroused by his hate crime stories and goes in for the kill. He starts talking about what he wants to do to my nether regions and how he's into bdsm and wants to tie me up. This man is a good deal bigger than me (as was the other), so I'm trying reject him as politely as I can. He starts closing in on me when the band that was on stage finishes playing and everyone begins pouring out to get more booze. I quickly escaped amidst the crowd and stayed close to my friends the rest of the night.

These stories are nothing compared to some of things I've read here, but it was still pretty unnerving. I've had a few other run-ins with creepy men, the last one that happened a few months ago being the worst. My shyness and social anxiety is what I believe kept me from being assertive and telling these people to go spontaneously combust somewhere. This is no longer a problem for me. I will be an asshole to an asshole. I don't know if that's good or bad."	t5_2t3t8	True
1339321333.0	uufhu	The Provincetown Stalker	WritingImplement	140	15	21	"When I was 12, my parents decided that they liked camping.  Now, they didn't actually *like* camping, but they decided we had to go camping.  Before I knew it we were at Nickerson State Park in Brewster, MA.  My parents are also suckers for buying stuff for which they have no need, and so a few days in we took a trip to Provincetown.

For those of you who don't know, Provincetown is somewhat of a progressive resortish town at the tip of Cape Cod.  It's mainly known as a resort town for gay and lesbian couples.  Because we live in a time where homosexual folks still aren't fully accepted (moreso 13 years ago), many folks saw Provincetown as a haven to safely explore their more... wild sides.  It wasn't uncommon to see pairs of men lounging in the yards of cozy bed-and-breakfast places in banana hammocks making out.  I guess the big point here is that slightly-deviant behavior isn't looked at twice in P-town.

We were walking down Commercial street, when I noticed that a guy had been following us.  He was somewhat lanky and awkward, with patchy facial hair (a style affectionately known as ""chin pubes"").  He looked away when he noticed I was looking at him.  Feeling kind of awkward, I stayed extra close to my parents.  We went into a military-themed surplus and junk store.  I wandered off, figuring I was relatively safe among the piles of cool stuff (plus, they had a full suit of medieval plate mail for sale that I had to stare at).  I was eyeing some old army helmets, when I looked up and saw Chin-pubes down the aisle.  When we made eye contact, he quickly turned to look at something on a shelf.  Every few seconds he would glance back to see if I was still watching him.  I felt pretty damn uncomfortable.

I ducked into a nearby aisle while he was pretending to look at something and booked it to the register in front (near a witness), and waited for my parents.  They opted to not buy anything, and we went on our way.  Given how boring the rest of the stores were, you'll have to forgive me for glossing over what happened, but at every store, Chin-pubes was there.

After some more store-hopping, my parents decided it was time for dinner.  They spotted a restaurant they wanted to visit called Arnold's Lobster and Clam Bar (in Eastham, I think?), so we all piled into the car and took off.  I looked out the rear window, and there was no Chin-pubes in sight.  Suffice it to say, I was pretty damn happy that he was gone.

We arrived at the restaurant, and were seated.  I was happily munching away on my chicken tenders (it was very, very rare that we ate this well, so I was really savoring every bite), when I had to pee.  I got up, found the men's room, and got into a stall (I was a really shy and timid kid). Just as I was about to unzip my pants, someone else walked into the men's room.  Like any incredibly shy person, I paused in order to wait for him to leave.

He walked to the urinals, paused briefly, then walked to a stall.  He got on the ground and looked under the gap.  He got back up, and repeated at the next stall.  At that point, I was frozen with fear.  He got up, stepped outside my stall, then got down on his hands and knees, and poked his face under the door of my stall.  It was Chin-pubes.  What can only be described as a pedo-smile spread across his face, and he reached for me.

I screamed bloody murder and punted his face as hard as my chubby 12-year-old legs could kick just as he grabbed my left leg.  He let go of my leg, grasped his face and reeled back before I could kick him again, and bolted out of the bathroom.  I opened the stall door, and there was blood in a trail from the stall to the door.  I timidly left the bathroom, looking around nervously, and got back to my parents' table, where I told them about Chin-pubes.  I was told I ""have too much imagination,"" and they don't want to hear about my stupid stories.

I didn't sleep one wink for the rest of the trip, because I knew if Chin-pubes could follow us down half the Cape without being noticed, he could follow us back to the campsite.  The next morning, I couldn't help but notice my clothing from the previous day wasn't on the clothesline anymore."	t5_2t3t8	True
1329366420.0	pruhu	The Hotel	enjoiturbulence	150	23	23	"This just happened, tonight. Not to me but to my wife. I'm writing this from a McDonald's parking lot three blocks from the police station where my wife is giving her statement. 

She works front desk at a hotel. It's a busy one, given more to the business types. She usually works until eleven or midnight, and being the protective type, I'm usually there with her, though not for altogether altruistic reasons, but wifi, coffee, and tv. 

Three weeks back, I'm there watching an episode of Justified and I meet this fellow. I got his name but forgot it instantly. He's staying there long term, not going to say why. Business of sorts. I don't like him, one he interrupted my show, two, I can tell he's off. Rambling, has a cast on his hand from what he said was hitting a wall. Speaks of 2012 prophecy and fundamentalist Christianity. Talks of being sober from drink for 36 months but takes a lot of pills. 

He's got issues. He had an ambulance called last week, apparently an OD. 

Still there, tonight he calls down to my wife. Says call the police. My wife asks if anyone's hurt. He says someone will be in about 90 seconds. 

She acquiesces, cops are called.

I'm not there tonight, what I know she told me while waiting to be interviewed.

He comes down and goes to the dining room. He's got a gun. The assistant manager goes out there and then my wife does, a couple minutes later. The assistant manager is face down on the carpet, the man over him, still holding the gun. He sees my wife, that gun points at her.

Monday the manager of the hotel says he doesn't want me there all the time, nothing personal he just thinks it might be weird to the guests. That's why I wasn't there, I was out with some friends.

The man points that fucking gun at my wife. 

He here's something, gets distracted, my wife backs up and gets behind the wall.

The police come in, a lot of them. 

She hears the man yelling, then she hears a shot. She didn't know who pulled their trigger.

1368318010.0	1e5o94	Apparently, I make some pretty damn good tea.	cadeea	153	33	23	"This is another tale from the Java Bar at Wild Oats before it was merged into Whole Foods. I was a nineteen years old, female, and had long auburn hair at the time (this will be important later).


**Background: The Gem and Mineral Show** *You may skip this paragraph.*

Every year (around February) Tucson hosts The Gem and Mineral Show. Apparently, it is the largest one of its kind, and attracts dealers from all over the world. Big, thick quartz crystals as big as your arm, towering stalagmite sculptures cut in half to display twinkling mounds of amethyst inside, fat golden drops of amber nesting prehistoric insects in their glowing depths… Even if you weren’t a geologist’s kid (like I am), you’d be swept away with all the wondrous items being sold at stalls. Dust and silt from giant limestone slabs peppered with fish from ages long past settle over everything in a grimy haze. The only true language spoken amongst the vendors is that of commerce and the occasional cough from the silt. Wads of cash exchange hands at a dizzying rate and rare collectibles disappear in a swath of wrapping paper and plastic bags. Because it is such a lucrative business, it tends to attract those looking to make a quick buck at someone else’s expense. It is not uncommon for the vendors to import their own guards to ensure the safety of their valuables. The less-than affluent dealers learn that Tucson is native to various scumbags, most of which are very skilled in exchanging stolen goods for something that’s easier to consume in a less than legal manner.


The Wild Oats is located on Speedway, just east of Alvernon. It is a pretty central location and sits on several major bus lines. During late January through February, it becomes a bustling hub for all the out-of-towners staying at hotels in the area. Colorful dresses from India stick out the most, but everyone else pretty much chooses to don western attire. You can guess at where they’re from by eavesdropping on conversations, or what kind of accent they have when they try their English out.  Honestly, it is my favorite time of year, and I don’t even mind that it’s busy.


I was working the late juice bar shift (again) and scrambling to get everyone their correct orders. My espresso bean supply was dwindling from all the double-shots being ordered, but the volume died down around 6-7ish. Having no immediate customers, I propped my elbows up on the counter and people-watched the checkout lines (it’s a favored pastime). Among the couple of people I had been overtly staring at, there was a man in a tailored grey suit with a partially opened black shirt, salt-and-pepper hair, and a chiseled, well-defined jaw line. His skin was swarthy, and he had a neatly trimmed goatee.  This was before the latest series of Batman movies came out, but I swear to god the casting director had this guy in mind when he was looking for someone to play Ra’s al Ghul. Being a very striking gentleman in his late 40s to early 50s, I mentally remarked on his attractiveness before moving on to people-watch the next cashier’s line.


My glance must’ve caught his attention, or he had a real hankering for a spot of tea. I see him jerk his head towards me, and two **huge** muscled men wearing sunglasses, tight black shirts, and slacks lumber out from behind in line and escort him to my juice bar. The one that was on my left actually pulled the chair out for Ra’s al Ghul and scooted him in. The guy on the right had his massive arms crossed and stood just a bit behind his boss. I mentioned it before, *but both men were wearing their sunglasses indoors after the sun had already set outside*. Who does that anymore?


Mr. al Ghul was very charming with his thicker Russian accent, and would have had a soft-spoken elegance to him if not for the presence of his two bodyguards and the slightly menacing way he carried himself. He politely asked what kind of teas I had to offer, and said he would not be offended by the typical American assortment usually provided. After going through the usual list of Tazo teas, he sighed and responded with something along the lines of “Surprise me.” Naturally, I interpreted that as “Don’t serve me swill, or Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum will break you“. 


As an aside, my mom is a worldly woman, and spent childhood and her adult life England. South Kensington, to be precise, but I have no idea where that’s located. All I know is that she has tea protocol and preparation down to a science, and imparted a good deal of that onto me. Don’t scorch the tea or plunk lemon wedges in it, and may heaven help you should you dare sweeten it with honey. If it is black tea, make sure to warm the cream before adding it, or you’ll make it lukewarm. When removing teabags, do **NOT** squeeze the excess tea off with your fingers. Wrap the string around the back of a spoon twice and gently pull, then discard immediately. Etcetera, etcetera.


Luckily, I had a box of tea behind the counter that wasn’t Tazo. I don’t recall the exact brand, but it was an import black tea with a yellowed parchment box and black lettering. Some customer had wanted to sample it, so they let me keep the rest of the tea bags behind the counter. I warmed some cream up with the steamer while his tea was steeping, extracted the tea bag, added some rock sugar crystals, and gently poured the milk in, holding back foam with the spoon. Stirring gently, I placed a napkin in front of Ra’s and positioned the cup on his right. I noted that during the entire preparation process, he was staring intently at my hands.


Looking directly at my face, he brings the cup to his mouth and takes a short sip. I remember seeing surprise on his face, but the details of whether it was a quirked eyebrow or a glance down at what he was drinking are kind of hazy. I do recall that he said something in Russian and the bodyguard on the right detached himself and wandered over to a lady with slightly frizzy hair, chatted, and escorted her over to stand behind Ra’s al Ghul.  During their exchange, he’s telling me that this is the best cup of tea he’s had and I can definitely hear excitement in his voice. He then tells me that they’re looking for a girl to watch the booth at the show here, and at another one someplace in Russia. It is at this point that my ears perk up, because I’m always on the lookout for more money and a chance to travel. Of course, I expressed my interest and he hands me a business card.


It was on a very heavy, but vaguely transparent card stock with stamped gold letters and a symbol of two fish intertwined. (I regret keeping at my ex-boyfriend’s house because it was so beautiful and I wanted to share it with all of you, but he probably burned it along with my copy of Dragon Quarter and the pair of panties I left there. At least I hope he did.) On the English side, it gave an address in Singapore, and on the Russian side I think it said something else. Unfortunately, I don’t know enough about the Cyrillic alphabet to even type it out. Needless to say, it was very impressive, expensive, and not something you can order from Kinko’s. It was a work of art.


After handing it to me, he kind of squinted his eyes, smiled, and remarked on what pretty red hair I had. As I said before, my hair’s naturally auburn, but a lot of people mistake it for being red. He then motions for the woman to approach, and starts speaking with her. I can tell it is German, even if I don’t quite grasp what they’re saying. Excited because I had just enrolled in my first semester of German, I waited for a natural pause in their conversation to offer her a polite *Wie geht es dir?* and smiled.


This apparently shocked both of them. Before she can respond, he holds up a fist and starts bombarding me with questions. What languages do I speak, how tall am I, do I have a boyfriend. A little taken back, I answer a little German, some Spanish, and Japanese. Maybe 5’9”, and no, not yet.


“No Mandarin?”


“Ah, no. Sorry.” I don’t know why I apologized.


He grinned at me, and then told me that he needed a governess for his children in Singapore. His wife only speaks German, and he would like me to make him tea. I had no idea that the woman he had treated so rudely was his wife, but she did not look offended at all. The way both of them were smiling was a little unsettling. This guy had complimented me in front of his wife, and had offered me a position based on my ability to make a good cup of tea, and my hair. 


Shrugging it off, I asked how long they were in town for, and he said for another week. He told me to contact the number on the card and he would purchase the set of plane tickets. Standing up now, he once again thanked me for the tea and I responded in turn. With bodyguards on either side and his wife trailing five or so feet behind, he left the store looking like a Russian mob boss.


Now, I never did contact him. I told my story to a few of my coworkers and showed the business card, and they told me he was probably in the human trafficking business. As for me, I’m not so sure. I definitely got weird vibes off him, but he might only have wanted a tea wench. Thoughts?

1354920499.0	14gwca	My subway stalker (the sandwich shop not public transportation)	Krillzbee	146	24	12	"When I was 16 I got part time job at a Subway.  There's some details I should write now. 1.) The store was in a plaza and the entire front of the store was windows. 2.) I had a set schedule every week because my extra curriculars. 3.)Little Caesars is on one side of the store and a laundromat is on the other side  Anyways..  We often had people come in and just get drinks and cookies (as opposed to an entire meal) because we were right next door to a laundromat.  I pretty much assumed they just wanted to mosey around, get a snack, whatever!  This one particular guy Cederick would come in regularly.  He was this short, skinny guy and talked A LOT.  I'm pretty social and would small talk with him.  I never thought anything of this because frankly, I loved most of my regulars! Cederick had been coming in for a couple of weeks but after awhile he stopped purchasing things from the store.  He also started standing at the end of the counter (near the bread if you are familiar with any Subway set-up)  and would talk and talk.  He started to really get on my nerves. He would talk while I was helping customers and his conversations started getting really aggressive, suggestive, sexual, and completely not-okay.  One of my coworkers, Deb, had no patience with this at all and she told him that he can no longer just come in to hang out and that it's rude for him to talk over other customers.  Well Cederick disappeared for awhile after she confronted him.  
A few weeks later though, I noticed that I would see him lurking around outside and staring into our windows.  Sometimes I would see him right at the edge of the windows peering in at me.  It was creepy but I brushed it off.  Then one week I had some obligations and had to take some days off, work days I normally didn't and just move my schedule around.  Well, Cederick noticed.  He came in when I was normally there and demanded to look at the schedule to see when I was working.  Deb was fucking pissed. (she was pretty protective over me for some reason.. loved her for it too!!!) Deb was so angry that she had a meeting with my manager and myself so we could talk about him.  We came to an agreement that if he came in and didn't buy anything that we could call the police.  Welp, Deb told this to Cederick a few days later when he came in to see me (while I was hiding in the back of course!)  Broke and crafty Cederick found a loophole... and started begging people outside of Subway to buy him food!!  When someone agreed to purchase him a sandwich, it was his ticket in.  When people wouldn't buy him food, he just stood outside and looked in at me.  This didn't happen for too long because we told our manager about the begging and she was extremely mad that he was not only harassing a little innocent krillzbee but our customers as well.  We called the cops and they told us to let him know he's no longer allowed in there, it is considered trespassing now, and to call them to come sort things out if need be.  Well ""if need be"" happened when Ced became irate when we kicked him out.  He RAN when I called the police and said they should come down because there's a bit of a situation.  Mr. Cop showed up talked to us took a report and left.  That did the trick and Cederick was gone forever after that. 
JUST KIDDING. Shortly after the cop-calling event I away for college for about four months.  I came back in December to work for a couple of weeks though.  On my second or third day back I went outside for a smoke break.  As I step out back near the dumpsters I look over and there's Cederick.. all dressed up in his Little Caesars uniform with the creepiest 'ima rape you!' look on his face. While I was away he took it upon himself to get a job next door!! I ran inside and told my co-worker (not Deb) who thought I was over-reacting.  When I got home I told my mom that the stalker was back and she told me that I really needed to talk to the Little Caesars manager.  I talked to him and he was completely understanding of the situation.. he also informed me that Cederick had said some really inappropriate things after he saw me outside that one day. (he wouldn't give details.. sorry) Cederick was fired within the week.  I saw him one last time creepily outside of the window but this time he was scowling and angry.  I have since quit that part time job and moved away so I hope I never have to encounter that weirdo again.

I was 18 years old, and my younger brother was 17. Now, a little background, my brother was not a tiny teen, he was 6'3"" at 17 years old already. My mother, as well, is 6'0"". 

We were walking around in the mall, when off in the distance, we heard a shout. My mom looked up, and saw this huge man, about 6'1"" and probably 300 pounds walking at an aggressively fast pace. He looked really angry, and was closing in on my mom for some reason. When he was about 10 feet away, my brother noticed he wasn't going to stop and looked like he was about to attack my mother. My brother then stepped in front of her, in between her and the man. The man walked right up to my brother and pushed him hard with his entire body, trying to get around him to get to my mother. At this point, the man and my brother were screaming at each other, the man telling my brother to move, and my brother telling the man to fuck off. 

The had just started throwing punches when another man, who had a very small build probably about 5'10"" and around 50-60 years old, jumped onto this man's back and started trying to drag the man off of my brother and away from my family. This is when the mall security decided to come around and drag the man away. The cops showed up, took statements from us all, including the older gentleman. 

The cops and mall security told us that the man had attacked a number of other women in the mall, for reasons unbeknownst to them. The older gentleman who jumped onto the man told us that he saw what the man was doing to my brother and that he was attempting to attack my mom and decided to help us out. He was very kind. It was such a scary event, and to this day we aren't sure what happened to that man in the mall."	t5_2t3t8	True

In complete odd stroke of coincidence, a cab then comes around the corner, and stops for us. Which was weird, because no one had called for one. The cab picks up another couple and we're off to the races. The couple gets dropped off first, then our house is the next closest stop. Eric (the bro) gets out of the cab at our stop with us. He tells the driver that his house is just a couple blocks away and that he'll walk. We pay the driver and I wander inside. 

I take a leak, get out of my bathroom, and Eric is sitting in the giant bean bag in our living room about to pass out. I look at my roommate like ""WTF"". He says that he just asked if he could have a glass of water, and when he turned around, Eric had made himself at home. Now keep in mind, although I'm calling him Eric now, I didn't even know this dude's name. I wrote it off and figured ""Well, it's just another party dude that partied a little too hard. We'll just let him sleep then kick him out in the morning."" So we let him pass out. 

I wake up early the next day, and am moving about the house getting ready for work. Eric wakes up like 2 hours later. Now normally, I'd expect someone in this situation to be like ""OMG where am I? I was sooooo drunk last night. Thanks man, see ya later"" But no. Not this fucking guy. Not Eric. 

Eric gets up, uses my bathroom, grabs himself a glass of water and starts watching Netflix. I want to say something, but I have a long day ahead of me already taking up space in my mind. The audacity of this guy was something else. Not since I was like 8 have I seen someone make themselves at home like that in a strangers house. 

My roommate then asks if I can give him a ride to his car. I say sure, and offer to take Eric home on the way. He says that he wants to go with my roommate. WAT.....ok ""sure man."" My roommate says. 

As I'm working that day, I get texts from my roommate that they ended up hanging out all day at a Country Club pool and drinking cocktails. My roommate doesn't know a lot of people in this town so I figure it's good for him to hang with someone, even if he is kind of a douche. 

Well 5:45PM or so, I hear my roommate come home. And Eric's still with him. They are going to a resort in a small town over an hour away and through the mountains. At this point I'm kind of wondering WTF my roommate is doing spending all day with some weird dude he just met but whatever. They go to the resort that night. 

As the evening progresses, my roommate is sending me more and more text messages. He's becoming more and more annoyed with his new buddy as the night goes on. He eventually ends up ditching him at like 3 in the morning and driving home. I was well asleep several hours before that. 

I wake up the next day, and my roommate was telling me how much of an asshole this guy had turned into as the night went on. As he's telling me this story, I hear the doorbell ring. It's Eric. 

""Whasup, brah?"" he says to me somewhat giddy as he stands there with his Big Gulp. 

This dude was abandoned 70 miles away and ended up right back on our doorstep 7 hours later. I was getting the ""I think we fed a stray cat"" feeling. 

Thankfully, my roommate was getting ready to drive out of town to go work and I had to leave for work as well. Eric asks for a ride to the bank from my roommate. He says ""Sure..."" in a not so enthusiastic way and off they went. 

About 7 hours later, I'm home alone and I hear my doorbell ring again. I open the door, and Eric just walks in and starts raving. He claims that he ""forgot"" about his drunken disorderly in public ticket he had gotten recently and he needed to pay the fine by midnight or else he'd have a warrant for his arrest issued. He asked if my roommate was coming back and I told him no. I knew what was going to happen next....

He asks me if he can borrow the money to pay the ticket until tomorrow. I tell him flat out no. I just don't have it. He starts to kinda argue with me a bit more. I shut him down again and tell him ultimately that I don't know him and it's not my problem. He leaves in a huff with my roommates number. I had foolishly given it to him *before* I knew what the fucking problem was. 

He blew up my roommates phone but my roommate never answered due to my warning him not to answer his phone tonight from any strange numbers. The roommate said he got at least 5 calls and a few text messages. 

Fast forward even more. It's midnight. *DING DONG* GUESS WHO? 

Fucking Eric. Again. This time, he claims he left his house keys in my roommates car and he just now noticed he didn't have them. He needed a place to crash and that my roommate said it was ok. My roommate told me that he was full of shit and that he didn't have any strange keys in his car. 

I told him that I thought he was full of shit, but from the looks of him, he looked drunk and like he was going to tip over at any minute. I told him that I know these kinds of games and that he could stay one more night, but I was getting him up at seven AM and he wasn't welcome back. Once I gave the ok to stay, he took off his shirt and was passed out again in the bean bag within minutes. 

I drug his ass out of bed around 7:30AM (I slept like complete shit with some strange weirdo in our house AGAIN) and took him to the bank. I told him ""good luck"" and drove off as he walked into the bank. 

Here's the kicker. My roommate called me this afternoon and said he had Googled this guy's full name. I didn't know it until he told me. The first two links that come up are forums where people describe this guy doing the same kind of shit all across the country. He's apparently been abandoned by his family or some craziness and does this shit all the time. 

[Here](http://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/p/37138466/Anyone-know-Eric-Lannon.aspx) and [here](http://phantasytour.com/bands/1/posts?page=1&amp;topic_id=3262895) are a couple of links of other people discussing his douchebaggery. Sounds extremely similar to what I experienced with him. There are pictures of the guy on those forums as well and I can tell you he looks the same. 

If he comes to my house again, I'm calling the cops. Enough with the riff raff.

1367180488.0	1dah59	You touch me, I punch you	Retiarius	173	54	11	"At the time of this story I was a 21 year old female. I was living in Italy  and had become pretty used to men staring or even calling out at me (seriously, does that ever work for these guys?). Anyways, some American friends came to visit me and I decided to take them to Verona. Verona is a very nice town and very rich, so the men there tend to be a little less creepy. I helped my friends order some gelato and then I went outside to wait for them while they paid. Suddenly I felt a hand run up my thigh and land on my ass while this creepy older voice (the kind of cackley voice that smokers get) says ""oh, che bella!"" (""oh, how pretty""). I was wearing shorts at the time, which really increased the whole icky factor. I should probably add now that I'm a black belt in Tae Kwon Do, on my university's sparring team, and my coach also puts high stress on self-defense techniques. My immediate reaction was to spin around and punch. I'm pretty tall and Italians (at least Northern Italians) are pretty short compared to me, so I aimed a bit lower than his face actually was, but I did land a solid hit at the base of his neck. While this didn't deal any significant damage, it did stun him enough that he stared wide eyed for a second before scuttling off.

While luckily this is a pretty benign story, this kind of encounter really freaks me out. How does anyone (regardless of culture or gender) think they have the right to touch someone in any sort of manner without their consent? Ugh."	t5_2t3t8	True
1360963054.0	18lo7m	No Drinks Beyond this Point	firerod0302	157	34	19	"When I was a child, I'd visit my grandparents in Mexico every other summer. I loved it. I loved having my grandpa spoil me with fattening Mexican candy, my grandma cooking REAL Mexican food, I LOVED IT. 

One of my favorite things to do with my grandma is take the pesera (a taxi bus) to the centro (a sort of flea market that was spread over about a mile). I liked watching the people, all crammed in their seats. At times I'd get uncomfortable, noticing men stare at me. I never thought it was because I was ""hot"" or anything, I just didn't like the intent in their faces. I noticed a man dressed in a suit, which I thought was weird, because I thought maybe he could afford his own modes of transportation. As a paranoid child, I already felt a bit of uneasiness. 

So my grandma and I are about an hour into shopping when I want some lemonade. You're not allowed to have drinks in the store where my grandma needed to go, so she warned me that I'd have to stay by the door. The set up of the store is quite simple, imagine a large car garage with clothes in it. You could see the back of the store from where I was standing, and the ""door"" was up during shopping hours. 

I could see my grandma clearly. I can't remember what exactly I was thinking, but I just know that I still had those men's faces from the bus fresh in my mind. I just know that I didn't not want to be alone. In the daylight, in a crowded block, I did not want to be alone. Now, as an adult, I've come to realize how intuitive I am, and how intuitive I have always been. 

About ten minutes of standing in the heat, holding two lemonades, I felt someone stand very close to me. Too close. Maybe it's because I'm used to the American definition of ""personal space"", but I did not like how close this person was. I was trying to see as much as I could out of my peripheral, but all I caught was that the person behind me was a man dressed in a suit...like the suit from the man on the bus, the kind you'd wear to a nice party. 

I took a step to my right...he followed behind me. I took a step forward...he got closer. I took a step to the left...and to no surprise, so did he. I was so nervous at this point, I didn't know exactly what to do. All I know is that the lemonade I had wanted so bad at one point was acting like an anchor. As I was looking for a garbage can to get rid of the drinks, I saw the man's hand rise up. He grabbed my shoulder, tugged me back, and that's all I needed to drop the lemonades. I ran inside the store, where I have been watching my grandma. She was picking out socks for my grandpa and just said, ""What happened to the lemonades?"" I can't remember my response, I can only remember the socks. I didn't look back, not once. 

Now as an adult, I feel that the reason he didn't hold on to me was because I spilled the lemonade onto his shoes, which probably made him step back. I don't know.

1353041902.0	13a8f1	"""I'm tryin' to get me a woman!"""		140	18	19	" After my freshman year of college I had a month to kick back before my internship started up. I ended up spending most of it back home in small town Tennessee with my parents, who were ecstatic to have an extra person around to help out with chores. One particularly chore I loved doing for them was to run errands while they were at work. I usually took my little brother with me for company and would buy him an ice cream or a soda for coming along. 


 One particular trip I had stopped to gas up my car at a local station. A pickup pulled up next to me, and the driver decided to strike up a conversation with me about my car while he fueled up. I drive an older model that seems to get comments whenever I'm out, and this man certainly seemed like the older car guys I was used to chatting with, so no warning bells quite yet. 


 My brother came out of the station with his prize soda, and the man asked whether he was my son. This struck me as odd. There is a bit of age gap between my brother and I, but not so large as to mistake us for mother and son. I laughed it off at first, then I caught the man's gaze. He was practically leering. I quickly answered no and turned to stop fueling up. 


 One of his friends asked from the truck if he was going to be done soon, and he yelled back, ""No, I'm tryin' to get me a woman!"" He then turned and grinned at me. ""So, you single then? No baby daddy or husband to worry about?"" I stammered out that I had a boyfriend and it was very serious (a half lie, but at that point a necessary one), finished fueling up, and jumped into my car.


 Had it ended there, it would have ended up as a weird little story for my brother and I to laugh about later. Instead, he followed me around town as I ran errands. Grocery stores? Check, all of them. Post office? Check. Even the little store where I went to help my brother pick out some new shoes. He never got close, always standing back an aisle or two and leering at me. 


 On the way home, going down one of the back roads, I spotted his truck behind me. My brother turned and confirmed it was the same guy from the station. I apologized, asked him to hold on, and floored it. I grew up in the area and knew all the little twists and turns. I took the most confusing maze of roads I could think of at speeds I definitely shouldn't have (sorry again, little bro) to shake this guy. I finally got home and parked my car where it couldn't be seen from the road.


 I'm now super cautious as to where I go and who I talk to when I'm driving without my father, older little brother, or fiance (all three pretty large, imposing guys), and I always expect to see that man whenever I go back home. Probably an overreaction on my part, but it's kept me out of trouble for the most part."	t5_2t3t8	True
1334246829.0	s6c65	So there's a creeper living on my street now	Tiz3r	145	21	56	"Haven't been home in a while, with college and all, but I was relayed this story at Easter dinner this past weekend.

There's this old guy next door to us. He recently had his middle aged nephew move in with him, and apparently he's become a bit of a menace. From what I've been told, he just sits out in front of the house all day and yells inappropriate stuff to people that walk by. We have a group of elderly women that walk up and down the street every day and they've stopped going past his house because he's been yelling that he can 'Smell their pussies' as they go by.

The house is also right at the end of the road, right next to the bus stop for the kids going to/coming from school. Several parents have taken to guarding the bus stop during this time because the guy has on a few occasions tried to get the kids to go with him. It's been checked, and the guy is apparently not a sex offender.

He's also made a habit out of looking into peoples windows, and he's told several of our neighbors that he's done it several times at my house. There's also been several occasions where he's apparently just walked right into other peoples homes uninvited.

I don't know what is up with this guy, but from what I've heard he's close to getting a serious beating from a few of the parents. My parents have actually used this as a reason to finally buy a gun for the house. I'll be home in 3 weeks or so, not sure how well I'll react if I see this guy pulling some of his creeper/pedophile shit."	t5_2t3t8	True
1332447005.0	r8uik	Gas Station Encounter		140	20	33	"First time posting here. My husband said I should share what happened a few months ago while I was at work.


PREFACE: I'm a 25 year old female, and at the time I was working the graveyard shift, by myself, at a gas station in southern California. I had worked for this company for a few years, and had never had any real problems because the corporation that owned the chain was very good about enforcing safety precautions. In the last few months before this incident happened, however, the chain was bought out by another company, and all of the things that were set in place to protect our safety, were disabled and thrown out to save money.
* security monitoring company was terminated.
* we were normally supposed to keep the magnetic door locks engaged at all times (from 10pm to 5am), and only let people in if we felt safe to do so. The new company made us leave the doors unlocked at all times, no matter what.
* we were previously not allowed to go outside on the graveyard shift, period. The new company wanted us to take trash out to the dumpsters and clean up the lot. Keep in mind, graveyard workers, work *alone*, and I happened to be the full time graveyard worker.



It started out as another typical night. I arrived at work for my shift at around 10pm. On graveyard, we were responsible for cleaning and stocking everything, all while helping customers. Liquor sales were stopped between 2am-6am. So, every night at 2am, I would engage the mag locks and not let anybody in for about 1 hour, so I could sweep/mop and stock the coolers, even though I was technically not supposed to lock the doors. 


So it was about 2:30am, and I was busy carting cases of soda back to the coolers for stocking (the main cooler is a huge walk-in, so I couldn't keep an eye on the front doors while I was inside, which is why I always locked the doors while I was stocking).


Suddenly, as I'm walking out of the backroom with a case, I hear somebody banging on the doors. I have a sign on the doors saying when I'll be back open, but what can I say, some people still just don't seem to get it. So I walk out, and there's this huge black transient man, obviously with a screw loose, screaming at me through the doors. I don't have time to sit there and talk with him, so I just say ""come back at 3:30, I'll be back open then,"" and I go about my business. 


Fast forward an hour, I've finished stocking and I've started making coffee for the morning rush. I collect all the trash, unlock the doors, and head out to the dumpster which is across the lot. **I should mention, there is nothing/nobody around.** All the surrounding businesses close at 9pm and don't open until long after my shift has ended.

Anyways, I walk out the doors with trash in hand, and suddenly I notice the same guy from earlier, just walked around the corner of the building next door, and he's waking straight towards me. He's also dragging a wooden baseball bat. I start panicking, trying to think what to do. I drop the trash bags, but I know I can't make it to the doors and lock them before he gets to me. 

He gets halfway to me across the lot, and I'm just standing there waiting, and assessing the situation. **right at that moment**, Ricky, a guy who works the night shift at an Albertson's a couple blocks away, pulls into the lot. The guy looks back at Ricky, and turns to head for the doors instead of directly at me. He leans his bat against the wall outside the doors, and goes inside. Ricky pulls right in front of the doors and sees the bat. We make eye contact, and he knows something is wrong.


He walks inside the store with me, gets a soda refill from the fountain, and then stand at the counter with me, while we wait for this guy to leave. The man walks up with a huge slushy that he tries to buy with food stamps. I inform him that he can't buy fountain drinks with EBT, so he grabs it off the counter, and dumps it on the floor. 


Now I'm pissed. Nobody fucks up my nice clean floors. *Nobody*. I go off on him, and tell him (in so many words) to get the fuck out of my store and threaten to call the police. This whole time, he's also yelling obscenities at me, and then Ricky goes off and says ""hey buddy, you don't talk to a lady like that!"" to which this man responds by getting in Ricky's face (Ricky is maybe 5'10"" tops, this guy is easily 6'4""and huge).


I engage the mag locks, and just keep telling the guy to get out. The crash bar on the doors disables the locks, so you can get out, but you can't get in. he's backing up to the doors, opens it, but is still standing there yelling with his foot in the door. He starts reaching for his bat, but can't reach it with his foot in the door. Finally, he slips his foot out for a split second, the mag locks engage, and he's locked out, screaming and banging on the doors, threatening to do all kinds of horrific things to me. 


The cops (6 of them!) finally arrive after a few minutes, and they instantly know who I'm talking about. They inform me that he is a local transient with a history of psychological disorders, who has been in and out if prison for violence, assault, and several sexual assaults of minors.


Ricky was my guardian angel that night. I don't know what would've happened if he hadn't have pulled in right when he did. Thank you Ricky, I truly believe you saved me, and I didn't know it at the time, but you also saved my daughter's life. I was 2 months pregnant.


I quit my job that same day. The company has done nothing to improve/change safety precautions. The transient man still frequents the store."	t5_2t3t8	True
1328496985.0	pcmqc	Crazy Lady Creeping Our House	hitomi013	142	19	39	"I was told that this would be better in this subreddit :)

This started last night while I was asleep and my mom and 2 sisters Sarah and Geena told me this morning. Last night there was loud crashes on the porch and a loud banging on the door around 10pm. It woke up mom and dad. Geena, who was still awake, went to Sarahs room(cause she was closer) and woke her up. 
A lady banged on the door harder and screamed for us to let her in. That helicopters were chasing her, something about a $1000 bond and that she had a 7 year old son who was cold. My mom grabbed her .22 and asked the lady who she was and why she was here. The lady who turned out to be fat(who also had her 7 year old with her. A tiny blonde cutiepie) and told mom she was running through the woods with someone chasing her. 
She said her name was Heather Johnson and asked if she could come inside. That her son was freezing. Mom said the boy could come inside but not her, and told the lady she wasn't afraid to use the gun. My dad called the cops, who soon arrived. At that point the little boy was sitting on our couch sipping some hot chocolate we made with the lady outside. The cop immediantly asked if she was on ICE(meth) Then when asked her name again, she said it was Heather Lilley. She asked repeatedly what county this was. Then insisted she needed to go to the bathroom. We agreed to let her use ours if the cop would escort her. She stayed in the bathroom for so long that twice the cop asked if she was okay. She came out with one of ours towels with her... bloody underwear in it. She threw in the trash. She was on her period and told us she owed us a new towel. After that we gave the boy an old winnie the pooh blanket, the cops escorted the 2 of them to God knows where......
 Now today was a half day at school. We come home at 10:30. Me and Sarah came home while Geena went to a friends house. On the way home we saw a red car down the dirt road. I jokingly said it might be the crazy ladys. Not even 5 minutes home there was a knocking on the door. Thinking it was dad coming home from grocery shopping Sarah opened the door. The lady was there with the red car in our driveway. She said the her son had had $200 in his shoe last night and thought it was somewhere around our house. Sarah, I don't know why said she could come and look for it. I jumped up and said no, thats not necessary. The lady looked at me and said I look like my mom then asked if I was going to call the cops.
 Sarah saw 2 figures across the street in our abandoned neighbors property and said they weren't supposed to be there. She said they were with her. One was her son. The other was an incredibly thin young lady with long dark hair and a gaunt unhappy face. I told her I was going to call my mom and she went down the walkway back to her car,pausing to paw through our trash. She left. My mom was in a meeting so I called dad who cursed and told me to lock everything. I eventually got a hold of mom who called the cops. She also got my aunt who lives close and is a total badass to come over until my parents got there. My aunt hurried over with a tight hold of a switchblade and a box cutter. My dad soon arrived and made me and Sarah recount the story. The my mom arrived. We all waited on the cops that took over an hour to arrive. My parents talked to them but the cops only said the lady might of stashed something in our house and had come back to get it. They confirmed that she was dealing in ICE and other illegal stuff. They said to call again if we saw her car and she would be arrested. Not much of a story but still quite unsettling :/"	t5_2t3t8	True
1374310947.0	1ioqyg	When I was 16 I was being stalked by a creepy guy I met at the beach	xXDiegoDestructionXx	140	19	36	"It was the summer of 2011 and I just turned 16 and got my first car. So like any 16 year old kid I liked to hop in my car turn up the music to ear splitting levels and go.
I started doing a lot of outdoor stuff when I got my car. My friends and I liked to go fishing and hiking.

One day I wanted to go fishing but everyone was busy, so I decided to head out on my own. No big deal. I packed my car and headed to the beach. It was a nice warm day on the gorgeous California coast, the only thing that would make it better was having a friend with me. 

I walked onto the pier and began fishing. People came and went, occasionally making conversation with me. I was there all day, and around 4pm an Asian man who appeared to be in his mid forties walked up and set up his fishing stuff right next to me. ""uh. Ok. Whatevs"" I thought to myself. He started making conversation and before you know it 2 hours had passed. 

""well shit, I better get home. Hope you catch something good out here""

I started packing my stuff and this guy says

""oh hey, can I have your phone number so we can text?""

I wasn't even thinking, I normally don't hesitate because I was used to giving it out a lot at school. 
""oh sure its *******""   oh shit.... What the fuck did I just do? I thought to myself. At that moment I already knew nothing good would come from this. Sure enough he called it to make sure I wasn't lying. The creepy bastard. I left without saying anything. Guess what? He followed me back to the parking lot saying he needed to go too.

Oh dammit. my hart started racing. He was gonna follow me. I knew.it. Luckily for me he parked way on the other end of the lot. He asked me to wait for him cause he still wanted to talk. ""ok. Yeah. I'll be here..."" yeah right.

I packed my car quickly changed out of my sandy beach smelling clothes, jumped in my car and drove away. My phone went off, and he started following me to the freeway entrance. I didn't answer.

As soon as I got on the on ramp I floored it and started weaving through traffic at 95mph trying to loose this creep. He already had.my cell number and knew my car. Luckily I was 45 minutes from home so I had plenty of time to lose him. thanks to my trusty Scion tC I was able to lose him after a 15 minute car chase. I got off the freeway, and went through some city streets where I managed to lose him after making various turns and getting bAck on the freeway.

He started harassing me over text messages. Saying that he wanted me and he would get me one way or another. He would ask me for nudes. He sent me some of his own and I kept the messages to show the police if things went further.

After months of not replying to his messages he asked me ""are you mad at me? I didn't ask for nudes that was my friend messing around"" . Chills ran thru my body every time I got a message from him. I was on the edge at all times constantly checking my surroundings and started carrying a switchblade. 

One day I finally replied to a message with ""uh whose this? I just bought this phone with this number. U must have the wrong number""

Lucky for me, that's all it took. He bought it. It stopped. I erased everything he sent me and went on with life. Since then I learned not to just blurt things like that out so quickly. Who knows what this dirtbag would have done to me. It still scares me to think about it."	t5_2t3t8	True
1370633805.0	1fvrqo	Welcome to College	Laugh_With_Me	154	34	32	"(18 year old female) I've been stalked quite a few times in my life, but thankfully most of the perpetrators were annoying rather than scary. Though these two individuals never got to bloom into full stalkers due to the fact that I moved out of the state, they were easily the creepiest individuals I'd ever met.

I'd begun attending community collage, and in an effort to make friends, joined an Anime Club. Once a month we'd scrape together enough money for pizza and soda, reserve a room in the library, and spend the day watching everyone's favorites. Everything was great until the second meeting. We watched Princess Mononoki and Kiki's Delivery Service and some other similar movies. Then Chad put in the last movie of the day. It was animated softcore porn. None of us knew what to do. We were all kind of socially awkward. He'd sat through our movies quietly and politely. Were we supposed to do the same? We spent the hour and twenty minutes red faced and casting each other horrified looks while Chad watched the porn with rapt attention. Finally it was over and he turned around.

""What did you guys think?"" he asked.

He was looking directly at me. That was the first time I noticed that I was the only female in Anime Club. Trying to be polite, I made a huge mistake.

""It was... um... interesting.""

I meant it to convey his *choice* was interesting considering that we'd all brought in Disney movies, but he took it to mean I was *fascinated with creepy porn.* From that day on, he showed up everywhere I went on campus. The second I entered any sort of common room, there he was with his laptop trying to show me anime porn, seating himself way, way too close to me so we could both lean into his screen and watch it. Each time I would tell him, ""I don't really like this show,"" as politely as I could and move to another table, but he would move right back uncomfortably close to me and assure me that I would get into the story if I just watched.

One day he sat down next to me sans laptop and I heaved a sigh of relief. He pulls out a note book and shows me a drawing. It looks like a creepy robot uterus. Hoping I'm wrong, I ask what it is. It's a creepy robot uterus. He's writing a book about an AI sex toy that invades lady parts and turns them into ravening sex fiends willing to do anything for the D. He wants my opinions on his story. I told him it wasn't really my kind of story and tried to move again. He followed and began asking really inappropriate questions in the name of ""research.""

Thankfully at this point, Vincent, the boy who'd brought me into Anime Club, noticed that Chad was following me table by table through the lunch room as I turned ever redder with embarrassment and came over. Chad fled before he even spoke. Chad was afraid of Vincent. Oh, thank *god.* Vincent was awesome and always in the lunch room. I could just hang out near his anti-Chad force field.

Vincent played World of Darkness with his friends in the lunch room, and I had played all through high school. By proximity I was eventually asked to join the game. I met with the storyteller, Paul, and gave him my character sheet. He informed me that I could keep whatever stats I had, but I was going to be taking over the role of ""Jenny,"" a long standing NPC. I asked who Jenny was, but was only told I'd get a huge kick out of it. So I attended, waiting for him to introduce me to the team.

They were playing the game in a seedy strip club setting. Everyone looked bored but Paul and a player named Bill, who were wrapped up in the ordering of a pen and paper hooker. I didn't know Bill, but he was huge and creepy, with an intense, unblinking stare that was always focused either on Paul... or me. I start to get a bad feeling, then Paul announces Jenny the hooker has arrived to service Bill's character. He turns to me and grins lewdly. Bill's searing focus locks onto me.

""I'm not playing a *hooker!*"" I yell. Paul looks crestfallen. Bill looks *enraged*.

""Dude, just let her play the bartender!"" Vincent sighs when Paul begins pressuring me.

Paul eventually relents, sulking. I finished that game, and showed up for one more, but Paul insisted on sexualizing my character, and Bill just sat there across from me both games breathing heavily and glaring. I quit the game. Bill started following me. He never spoke to me, just sat across the room from me, glaring and snorting. With Chad. They were friends. Of course they were.

I had to abandon the cafeteria entirely, because while Chad was creepy, I was pretty sure Bill was dangerous, and he wasn't afraid of Vincent. Also, it really looked like Chad was encouraging him to do something while they stared at me whispering.

I left the state at the end of the semester, but kept in touch with Vincent. About seven years later, I married him. When I brought up all the crazy things that happened back when we met, he told me that actually *everyone* was afraid of Bill, particularly Paul. They'd tried to disband the game because all Bill wanted to do was rent fake hookers, but he'd made veiled threats that he might do something insane if they stopped playing with him.

To this day I think Paul was offering me to Bill the same way you offer the crazy guy at the office a Snickers, just in the off chance that if he *does* do something drastic, he won't do it to *you.*

**TL/DR** Two scary college students creep me my first semester at college, but I met my husband, too.

1364238406.0	1azn86	Fake police carjacking... or worse	wemptronics	142	23	11	"Alright, I live in a major city in the South. It's a pretty big city, and as such one finds themselves driving everywhere at all hours of the day. This is not an elaborate story, nor typically terrifying, but there's enough left unanswered that it still gives me the creeps to think about.

It was around 1:30am and I was driving home from a friend's house with my then girlfriend Allison. We had been partying a bit, but as I was driving I had opted to maintain sobriety. Allison had a few drinks, but nothing serious and over the course of several hours.

Now, the house I was leaving is not in a particularly bad neighborhood, but not a good one either. The city where I live there are lots of gentrified areas where crack dealers live next to four person families. It's a place where you are fine in the daytime, but you wouldn't want to be walking the streets alone late at night. Being familiar with the area I decide to take a little cut-through street.

As I pull onto the street I end up at a stop sign. I look behind me, and there is a truck that pulls out of an adjacent road behind me to my left. I move forward from the stop sign and he continues to follow me. I think nothing of it. The road doesn't have many street lamps so its pretty dark and I can't get a look inside the truck's cab. 

I drive about another 20 feet and all the sudden I see blue lights in my rear-view mirror. Cop lights. Now I think, ""Awww shit, not again!"" However, as I look into the rear-view mirror I notice several things that don't seem right.

For one, there aren't many police trucks in the inner city area. Sure, there are some, but they are not common. Secondly, the police lights are not on the top of the cab like a normal cop car, but next to the actual headlights by the grill -- like a detective's car.  I also notice there is an air freshener dangling from his rear-view mirror. I've dealt with police officers on numerous occasions, but I have *never* seen one with a stereotypical pine tree freshener. Lastly, as I keep moving forward, slowly contemplating the situation considering pulling over, I notice the final strange variable: there is no police siren, no horn, no noise. It was late, it was dark, and I continued to drive slowly as I thought about all the odd factors.

If I had only noticed the first two factors I think I may have stopped, but the fact that the blue lights kept flashing without any siren was just... off. Also, I know in my state it is legal to pull into a well lit area at night time just for these circumstances. I decided that the air freshener, the position of the lights, and the lack of sirens was just too weird. I wasn't going to risk pulling over in the bad area so I decided to move forward at around 20mph until I got to a gas station.

The truck continues to follow me. There are a lot of speed bumps and road signs on this road, and thinking there is possibly a cop pulling me over I abide by all the laws. The final straw that I determined made this truck a false police officer: he also obeyed all the traffic laws. When a cop wants you to pull over, you pull over, and if you don't they aren't going to stop at a stop sign to let you get away. This guy stopped when I stopped, moved forward when I did, and even turned as I decided to get to a more populated road.

After about 100 yards he turns off his lights, both the blue lights and his main headlights, takes a left behind me, and peels away. It was at that moment I knew he was not a cop. I don't know exactly what I avoided that night. I drive a nice car, so it could be a car jacking, but I don't rule out something worse. If it weren't for my ex-girlfriend's presence I may have stopped.

Ultimately, I'm just happy I didn't.

1352679048.0	1319b5	He still contacts me.	danooper	152	32	29	"To start, I'm 21, female.

When I was 14 years old, my family and I moved across the United States to the east coast. I was angry because I was lead to believe that would be spending my high school years with my best friends, but in a quick turn of events, we ended up moving when my dad suddenly decided to retire.

I was lonely, sad, maybe depressed. I hated my first days of high school. I spent most of my time online, as we finally updated to DSL. I was finally awarded unlimited internet access with no supervision. 

One night, I was about to send an IM to one of my old friends. I typed in what I believed to be her screen name, and sent a message. I asked how she was doing. It wasn't her. 

After clearing up the misunderstanding, me and whoever was on the other end continued to talk. Being 14, I'm sure I talked about myself a lot, but mostly because I was prompted by plenty of questions. I found out the person I was talking to was a man, who lived in NYC, and was going to Cornell. 

After about a month of talking online, he convinced me to give him my phone number. Neither my parents nor I had cellphones at this time, so I gave him my home phone number late one night. He said the caller i.d. would say unknown, so I would know it was him. I answered in the middle of the first ring so my family wouldn't wake up.

We talked all night. He had a kind voice. I knew he was older than me, but not how much. We spent weeks talking on the phone while my family was asleep. One day he messaged me on AIM, addressing me as Miss 300, which was the number of my house address. I asked how he found out my address, and he said my phone number and last name.

Looking back, I feel like an idiot for exposing so much of my personal information to a complete stranger. I got a cell phone two months after talking on the home phone. We began texting and I learned how to use t9 without looking. He was my only ""friend"" and I felt disconnected from people my own age. 

He was 27, a 13 year difference. He introduced me to lots of sexually explicit material that I never would have been exposed to. I sent him pictures of myself when he asked for them, and eventually when he didn't ask. But we also talked about politics, different languages, having a family. He told me when I turned 18, he would marry me and take care of me. It sounded like a fairy tale. 

One day when I was 15, about 9 months after we had been talking and ""in love,"" I read an article in some teen magazine about adults having interests in adolescents, about how it's disordered for mature individuals to be attracted to young teens, how there's a huge gap in developmental stages. I felt a pit in my stomach. Why hadn't I ever thought of this before? How stupid could I be to believe that someone who is twice my age could be in love with me? I cried and threw up and couldn't eat for days.

I told him to never speak to me again, never contact me again, leave me and my family alone, or I would tell the police. I didn't really know how to tell the police, but it seemed like a good threat. 

It's been several years and I've graduated high school, had several serious relationships, and am pursuing 2 bachelor's degrees. My life seems normal for the most part, except for my hyperactive sexuality that I don't think would exist without him. A few times a year, he'll message me from AIM (which is connected to my phone number) and ask me how I'm doing, but I never respond. I don't know how. Sometimes I fear that I'll look up and see him somewhere, but then I remember I've never even seen a picture of him. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1352234038.0	12qz2b	Red car, white van.	elfinette	145	25	21	"I was eleven years old when this all happened, so it was about ten years ago. From ages six to ten I lived in a very tiny town, so I was very young for my age and pretty ignorant about stranger danger. When I was ten we moved to a medium sized city called Kelowna in BC.

I would ""ride my bike"" (aka walk my bike because I hated riding it) to and from school every day. I was terrible at navigating. I would pretty frequently get lost on my way to school or on the way back home. Not super lost, just ""take a wrong turn and end up needing to ask a nice gas station attendant or stranger for directions"" lost.

In October I kept noticing this red car. It was a little red hatchback from the 90s with quite a bit of rusting around the doors. I was a very daydreamy kid so I was pretty terrible at minding my surroundings. But even I couldn't miss how, nearly every day on my way home from school, I would see this red car drive by me. He would drive by me on the street my school was on, and some days I'd see him again on the highway or even sitting in the parking lot of the gas station I would walk by.

This went on for about two weeks. I finally mentioned it to my mom, who asked me if I'd been watching X-Files again and told me to get control of my imagination. I came to the conclusion that the red car probably belonged to a schoolmate's parent and that's why I would always see it around the school. Totally normal.

The day after I told my mom about the red car was a Saturday, so I didn't go to school. I walked to the gas station to buy some five cent candies and, probably by chance, I saw the red car at one of the pumps. The owner didn't seem to notice me, but I got a good look at him.

He was in his early twenties, with dark but sparse facial hair and a short haircut. He was very tall and skinny, and even though it was well into October he was wearing shorts and a light sweatshirt. Something about him creeped me out. I just went home without any candy.

On Monday I was feeling a bit jumpy as I walked to school. I was on the lookout for the red car, which didn't really make sense as I only ever saw it in the afternoon, on my way home from school. As I was on the last stretch of road to get to my school, a white van pulled up beside me and was driving slowly along. I looked into the window and saw the young man who owned the red car. He was wearing glasses and had his hood up, but I recognized him. We made eye contact and something in me said, run!

I dropped my bike and booked it. I ran up to the first house I came to and knocked on the door. The man who answered the door ended up being a classmate's dad, and he took everything I said very seriously. He had me come in to the living room and he called the police, and then the school. The cops talked to me and kept an eye out but didn't find the guy.

A couple weeks later another girl (she was a grade younger than me) was approached by a guy who matched red car guy's description. She was playing on the playground after school when he tried to talk to her. She ran into the building and told a teacher and the guy booked it. After that we had a really nice police officer come to our school to teach us about stranger danger. But the guy seemed to give up after his second attempt with the younger girl and everyone just sort of forgot by the summer."	t5_2t3t8	True
1342725207.0	wtyfh	My campfire story.	mndcndy172	145	23	19	"Earlier this year I went camping, as I am wont to do. I chose to head to a campground that I often use because it's not far from my where I live (Since I've had kids, and I like to stay reasonably close just in case something happens) and also because it is almost always empty. I invited a few friends who were supposed to meet up with me the next day if they could. I arrived at the campground, put $4 in the honor system box and drove to my usual campsite. I was pleased that I had the place to myself.

I first walked over to the pit toilets to make sure they had TP, which they did, and then spent about 5 minutes looking at some of the rock formations near the entrance to the site. When I came back, the parking permit that showed I paid for my campsite was gone from under my windshield wiper and laid in the grill. I thought it was strange, but figured it was the wind – after all, I hadn't seen a sign of anyone else.

I left the campsite and hiked about a mile to the small lake where swimming and fishing is allowed. I put a line in the water and walked over to the beach. I started to get the feeling that somebody was watching me, but wrote it off as paranoia. That was until somebody started throwing rocks into the lake. I couldn't see them, and they didn't seem to be aiming at me, but every minute or so, somebody would throw a rock, make a splash, and then nothing – no giggling, no screams or “ghost” noises like I'd expect from a stranger playing a prank.

I realized that it was most likely one of my friends who knew I was up there and wanted to have a little fun with me, it's something we do quite often. I immediately hiked back to my van, it was unlocked and would have been too tempting a target to pass up. When I got there, my side door was open. I expected everything to be gone and/or tampered with, but everything seemed to be in order. I assumed I had startled who ever opened it before they could do anything to my gear. I locked my van and went back to the lake for my fishing pole. The entire time I was aware that someone was following me, but they never did anything. This let me narrow down my list of suspects to 3 or 4 friends who have the necessary skill to sneak up on me in the woods. 

I grabbed my pole and headed back, no longer aware of being followed. I assumed my friend got tired of playing with me and would have a surprise for me at the campsite. I was right, somebody had drawn a smiley face in the dust where I was going to put up my tent. It was both lame, and somehow chilling. I went ahead and set up my tent and got everything ready for the night. At the appropriate time (23:00 I'd guess) I announced - “Right! I'm off to bed, see you tomorrow!” to whoever was within earshot. I bunked down, but didn't go to sleep.

Some time later, I heard someone approach my site. I even thought to myself that whoever this was needed to work on stealthy approaches. I heard them shuffling the items I had on the picnic, but couldn't see anyone because I had put the rain-fly up on my tent to discourage a prankster from blasting me with a super-soaker or water balloons. Then I heard liquid being poured and thought to myself “bastards are ruining my coffee” (there's no potable water in the campground). Then I saw a flash and realized my visitor had used some stove fuel to light a campfire. Since we were under a burn ban at the time, I knew it had to be my friend who works for the National Forest, nobody else I knew would have done it. We might be assholes to each other, but we're always respectful and law abiding.

I sat up in my tent and said, in the most threatening voice I could muster - “Garou, I love you like a brother, but when I get out of this tent and you don't have a cooler full of beer with you, I'm going to bury this hatchet in your face!” There was no answer, just silence. I continued “Yeah, there might be some remorse, but I'll be over it before your body hits the ground.” 

With that I opened the tent, and glared at the figure in the camp chair across the fire. I was expecting to see my buddy, a tall native American man. Instead it was a thin, pale, blonde woman. I choked out “What?” just as she shot up and ran into the woods.

I did what I believe is referred to in the parlance as “Noped”. I broke camp and drove 20 miles away to a different campground. It's weird, but the fact that it was a young woman somehow scared me more than it would have had it been another guy sitting out there. She easily could have shot me (if armed) or even set me on fire if she chose to. 

The next day when I told my friend and erstwhile suspect the story, I was still so shaken/confused that I blurted out the amazingly awkward/creepy line “I thought I was going to kill you last night, but you didn't have a penis!”

1335875368.0	t1fgc	Angels and demons. 		140	20	18	"I've been debating on whether to post this on Let's Not Meet for a while, mainly because I have never seen the man, who is the subject of this story, face to face. I've only ever heard him. But it keeps playing on my mind, as do the memories in general, so here I am. Perhaps someone will be interested. This may be long, as the memories have been whirling around in my head for a while.

My childhood was spent in the middle of the countryside, a beautiful house in the middle of a field, surrounded by woodlands and farms. I could see a wood outside of my bedroom window - I remember watching all the crows fly around it at dusk. The closest town was two miles away, although we were on a hill so we could still see it from where we lived. The road by our house was long, but just your usual country lane, and there was never any traffic. Yep, it was a beautiful place, and pretty secluded. 

In my first memory of this, I must have been 8 or 9. It was either a weekend or in the summer holidays. The weather was gorgeous. I was playing in our large garden, collecting stones or leaves or whatever I used to do. My step-mother was doing her gardening, and my father was outside of our property trimming the tall hedges along the road to stop them from growing over (not really his responsibility, he's just a good guy). 

So I was doing my thing, and from behind me I heard the crunch of quick footsteps on our gravel driveway. I turn around to see my father jogging straight towards me, covered in twigs and leaves from trimming the hedges, shears in hand. He completely ignored my step-mother, until she began to loudly call out (our garden really was large) to him 'What's wro--', to which he got a massively stern look on his face, looked at her quickly and put his fingers to his lips, indicating to keep quiet. He got to me, and told me to come inside quickly. ""Come. Inside now. Quickly"" he said. I remember he said it gently and kindly, but he was obviously frantic. He waved my step-mother in with us hurriedly. Neither of us asked questions; My father has always been a laid back guy. I was wracked with nerves at his behavior. 

So we got inside the house, and me and my step-mother stood in the hall near the front door. My father locked and bolted this door, and then ushered me and my step-mother into a part of the hallway where there were no windows. He then went to - I assume - lock up the back door, then he returned. 

By this time, I could hear shouting and yelping from outside of the house.

Before my step-mother could say a word, my father simply said to her, quite breathlessly. 

""He's out there. He's only bloody out there. All this time.. He's bloody there. He's coming down the bloody road."" and then he shot a quick look at me.

My step-mother responded with an exasperated sigh, closed her eyes and put a hand to her face. The confusion and fear seemed to melt away from her, to be honest, but it was replaced with something like annoyance. I was still terrified, and kept staring at my father. That's when he told me exactly what was going on.

There had always been a rumour, apparently (I hadn't heard it), of a 'crazy man' who lived in our area of the countryside. As my father told me right then, he specifically slept rough in the almost unused wood storage yard a mile from our house. Except it wasn't a rumour, and the man was about to be walking past our house. My father had encountered him a few times before I was born. There had been rumours of people having accidents, regarding this man. While my father was explaining, I had began to hear the outside shouting more clearly - at least, out of the continuous stream of words, I managed to pick out a few of the loudest;

""ANGELS... the ANGELS.. Deeeeemons.. NOW.. ALL OF YOU.. DEMONS, EVERYWHERE.."" are the ones that stick in my mind.

He took a long while to go past our house. All I could do was stand there and hear the shouting. In all honesty, I was on my step-mothers side of things - while I was creeped out, surely it was just a mild annoyance? Why would my father assume he would be dangerous to us? Perhaps.. perhaps we could even talk to him, and he would be a nice (albeit crazy) guy? 

This happened a few more times from that point on. I'd have to stay in the house whilst the man passed. Sometimes the man would sound extremely angry, so I'd go in the part of the house furthest from the road and put the TV on. Sometimes he would just be shouting sporadically, in which case I went to the bedroom nearest the road and looked out the window, to see if I could catch a glimpse. The positioning of the window meant I never did, though, because of the hedges. Every single time it happened, I wondered why we had to hide. Why my father was reacting like this. 

Any wondering about that almost completely melt away with what is now the very last memory I perhaps have of this man.

I was about 12 or 13, I remember because I was now going to a different school. The man had passed by very early in the morning that day - I'd heard him, he had been particularly loud and angry, and he'd woken me up. I don't think he had woken my parents though. Anyway, my step-mother was taking me to school, my father already gone an half hour ago. We walk out of the front door and we spot a shadow underneath her car, which was on the far end of the driveway. Fearing it was our pet cat, my step-mother asked me to go and get him while she set the house alarm, so she didn't accidentally drive over him whilst we were pulling out.

I walked over to the car, and bent down to look underneath. ""Dudsy! Come on now, kitty... wha..""

I was looking straight into the eyes of a severed sheep's head. Right in the middle of the space under our car was a clean severed sheep's head. Eyes wide at me, tongue lolling out. My whole body went warm and my eyes fuzzed over with the shock. I got up calmly (still shock, I'm supposing), and ambled back to the house.

""It's a sheep's head"" I told my step-mother.

""...Don't be ridiculous..?""

""It is."" And I just waved my hand at the car. I just couldn't speak anymore.

I then had to watch whilst my step-mother knocked it out from under the car with a broom. I saw the blood spatter on the gravel as we drove away. The car ride to school was in silence.

There is no proof it was that man. All I can say is that we live in the UK, the only animals around us that would perhaps try to eat a *lamb* (this was a grown sheep's head) were foxes, and they were way too small. That would not account for how the head was cleanly severed. 

He was also louder that day. Perhaps that means he was closer.

It would also explain a little more why my father feared this man's crazy.

This past Sunday (April 29th) I saw my father for lunch. I decided to ask him about the man, knowing I'd probably give a try at posting on Lets Not Meet. See if there were any memories I had forgotten. Sorry to tell you, but my father didn't want to talk about it. He just nodded 'Yep, I remember' at everything I said, without offering much more information. He did let something slip though, in his mutterings about how he remembers..

I was told, when I was 8 or 9, that this man slept rough in the wood storage yard a mile from my house. Apparently, going by what my father said on Sunday, that was a white lie. He slept in Bluebell Woods. The woods I could see across the small field outside of my childhood bedroom window."	t5_2t3t8	True
1375553498.0	1jmxjn	The Grey Woman	AuchnotOuch	141	21	30	"I was reading some stories in this subreddit, and it occurred to me that I might have an interesting experience that might pique your interests. A couple years ago before I joined the military, I was a performer at a well known theme park/animal sanctuary/water park in the US. After a long hot day of dancing, I went back to my apartment to get cleaned up for a date with a guy I was interested in at the time. He came to pick me up and we went to the mall to go have dinner and a movie. 

After the date, we got in his car and began to leave the parking lot. We pulled up to a stop light that just turned red and was notorious for taking an eternity to shift colors. So we sit and wait and he asks me about my day at work (he also worked at the theme park), and I did the same to him. While we were talking I saw some movement to my right outside the car and glanced in the direction and saw a tall lanky woman with wire like grey hair jumbled in a huge knot of nastiness. It was dark so I couldn't see her face and just thought it was a homeless woman and felt sad for her. 

I returned my attention to my date and started to say something when all of a sudden I heard my side's door click open and the woman from outside was trying to get in. For being all skin and bones, she was quite strong and I struggled to pull the door in. She had one hand on the door and in her other hand was a medium sized kitchen knife whipping at me. She managed to cut my face, very minor, but nonetheless terrifying. As I struggled I looked at her face; It was the scariest part. She was obviously very malnourished, possibly struggling with drugs. Her face looked more like a pure bone skull than a flesh covered one. Her skin was wrinkly, making her appear elderly, but no way she could be with her strength. Her eyes were bloodshot to the point where her pupils blended with the rest of her eyes. But the weirdest part was the color of her skin. It was grey. It resembled the color of ash, but not in the dry skin kind of way. Her expression was a mixture of desperation, rage, and hunger. It was obvious she was seeing red, and my life could be in jeopardy. 

Realizing this, my brain released even more adrenaline and I managed to finally pull the door shut. My date was frozen with fear and I had to scream at him to lock the doors and hit the gas, regardless of the stop light still being red (he had an older car, no automatic locks). So he hits the gas, and I kid you not, the crazy bitch held on to the door handle and was dragged along side us for maybe 30 or so feet. I told my date to make a left turn up ahead sharply to swing her off, and he did, and she went flying off. I looked in the mirror and saw her barrel roll to a stop. My date stopped the car for a moment, trying to compose himself. We both looked back and somehow she managed to get up within a few seconds and she just stood there staring at us. Finally, she slumped her shoulders in defeat, turned around, and slowly paced away from us, seemingly unharmed. 

My date drove forward and we were both silent the entire way home. We ended up staying with each other because we were scared. It was completely terrifying, and really the first time I ever felt that scared. But I couldn't help but feel bad because she was obviously desperate for some kind of nourishment or resource. 

To add to the creepiness of the incident, the mall we went to had an urban myth that supposedly there are zombie like ""people"" that stalk the property. I doubt it was a zombie, but probably was a homeless woman in need of drugs, food, or money. Either way, her face and bloodshot eyes haunt me to this day.

I like in a smaller city with a very active nightlife, so there were plenty of people around. I noticed a man in his early thirties (I was 20) in an outdated green suit. He was very thin, and about 5'10. He was watching me, so so I made a note to be cautious of him. 

This is a fairly safe city, but there is a lot of homelessness and drug use. I'm used to being approached by strangers for one thing or another, and I'm generally good at getting rid of them.
Suddenly as I was passing an alley, a huge arm fell around my shoulders.  ""Hey baby, what's a guy got to do to have a friend like you for the night?""

I look up, and the speaker is a huge man, over 250 pounds and around 6'5. I tell him I'm just walking to the nearest casino to meet my friends, but his arm only tightens. He starts leading me toward the alley, and I can't get away. I'd like to point out, I was wearing a jacket that was buttoned from my neck to my knees, no makeup, and flat shoes. No way in hell did I look like a prostitute.

The man in the green suit pops up in front of us.
Honestly, I don't trust either of them. The giant man stops walking, and green suit asks him what's up. The giant responds, ""Nothing, just hanging out. She your wife?""
Green suit says yes, the giant hightails it out of there, and green suit walks me down the road a bit to make sure he's really gone.

1370395606.0	1foxgd	Man in the snow	Cal97	133	14	13	"This encounter is real, and happened to me 6 years ago, when I was 16.  For context, I'm female.

I live in New England (a northeastern region of the United States), where the winters are very snowy, with long, cold, dark nights and short days.  One such night in February, I was alone in my parents' house, which is in a safe, quiet suburban neighborhood where the houses are within about 100 feet of each other.  My parents had divorced years before and were still on good terms, so when my mom decided to sell the childhood home, my dad bought it so I could continue living there.

While in the process of moving, neither of my parents stayed at the house for a couple of nights, and only my room upstairs had furniture.  The rest of the house was mostly empty with boxes scattered about, and the internet had not yet been switched over, so I often sat at the far end of the living room and mooched off of our neighbors' WiFi.  It was fun not having my parents there for a couple of nights, so I stayed up late with my new laptop and surfed the web into the early hours of the morning.

During my second night of being alone, it snowed late into the evening and I sat in the dark living room on a folding chair with only my laptop screen for light, with snow falling quietly outside.  The neighborhood was silent, as cars don't usually drive by past 10 at night, and neighbors stay inside to keep warm.  At 2:30 AM, I decided to head to bed, and was wrapping up my internet activities for the night when I heard three very slow, quiet knocks on the front door, just a few feet away.  I immediately closed my laptop, knowing that the bright screen made me visible to the person outside since the windows weren't covered.

I got off my chair and walked very quietly over to the door and knelt down below a window to listen outside.  Frozen with fear, I waited for what was probably about 2 full minutes when I heard three more identical knocks.  They were very slow and would have been too quiet to wake anyone up who had been sleeping.  I gathered the courage to look outside through the window and saw a dark figure standing very close to the front door, dressed in a black winter coat and black pants.  A hood pulled over his head obscured his hair and face, and he stood still with his arms to his sides.

I contemplated calling the police but ultimately decided to continue waiting.  I moved back behind the door away from the window, and after about 2 more minutes passed, I could see the man walking down the walkway past the front of the house, leaving.  Suddenly, he stopped, turned around, and looked directly at the window through which I watched him.  About fifteen seconds passed as we stared at each other, but I couldn't see his face under the darkness of his hood.  Finally he turned around and walked down the driveway and down the street.  He didn't stop at any other houses, just continued down the street in the falling snow, and I watched him for about 10 minutes until he faded into the darkness.

As far as I know, this has not happened since then.  I still live in that house, and occasionally have nightmares in which the scene replays itself, except that in the dreams, I open the door for him."	t5_2t3t8	True
1370255673.0	1fknur	Stalked by a Morris Dancer	stalkedbymorris	153	31	34	"I've been wanting to tell the story of my stalker here for a while, but it seemed too long, so I hope nobody minds the length and details. It honestly surprises me how many of us out there have had encounters like this; every time I tell it to a friend, I get at least one other girl in the room reciprocating with HER creepy stalker story. It makes me angry that we can't expect to live our lives free of nutjobs and creeps.

I'm going to call MY stalker Morris to bring some levity to the story for myself. If you don't know what Morris dancing is, well. It's an English folk dance where the men wear little hats and knee-high white socks with bells on them. They dance in circles, kicking their ankles and giving little leaps. This guy was into it, and no, I wasn't living in England at the time. I can still console myself that at least my stalker had a unique hobby. A quick google image search will give you some sense of amusement over it too.

Morris and I had the same circle of friends, but he was about ten years older than most of us. This was when I was in my early twenties, and everyone thought of him as quite pathetic, but generally harmless. He was a big guy; over six foot, with a sad beer gut, long, lank greasy black hair and unfashionable, thick glasses. He had a way of speaking that betrayed exactly how shy he was - uneven intonation, rushed words, nervous laughter when nobody is saying anything funny.

Most of us were into drama, and while he was an amazingly terrible actor, we were always short on men for shows so he usually wound up with a bit part. Being in the same circle meant we usually wound up at the same parties. He came to a Halloween party at my house one year (yes: he even wore his Morris dancing costume), and the next year I bumped into him a few times over one busy month in the party season.

It started with messages. They were pretty harmless. I got one every few days, starting with ""Hey, it was so good to see you last night. Great talking to you, look forward to seeing you again."" At first, I didn't know whether he was extending the branch of friendship or trying to start a flirtation, but he had always creeped me out and so I decided to ignore it. 

The next message, later that week, was similarly along the lines of ""It really was nice getting the chance to talk to you a little more, hope we can talk again soon."" Considering we'd had about a 5 minute conversation of small talk, I had no idea what deep and meaningful connection he thought we'd had. I ignored it.

 Next it became a little more obviously stalkery: ""Hey, I see from facebook that you're going to Dave's play this weekend. I'm going Friday night. So maybe if you're going Friday night, we could sit together."" As a matter of fact, I was going to go Friday night - not any more. I changed all my plans for the weekend to avoid him, and continued to ignore his messages. I also decided to stop responding to facebook invites and skip a couple of parties. I was freaked out that he was using facebook to track where I would be. 

I didn't want to seem presumptuous by telling him to just leave me alone. For one thing, he hadn't outright tried to flirt with me in a way that I could call him out on, so maybe he was just being awkward. It seemed a little arrogant of me. 

For another, he was so awkward, I didn't want to deal with the repercussions of an outright rejection in our friend circle, because some guys lash out and tell their own weird version of events. The whole thing just sounded like a lot of work, so I ignored it, hoping it would go away.

The messages continued, two or three a week, utterly banal. They began to be timestamped from weird times - the middle of the night. I sort of laughed it off with ""Oh, another message from my stalker!"" That is, until the last message, which came after about two and half months of short, ignored emails. I opened it up, message timestamped 4am, and it said to me ""It's clear to me now that this is never going to work between us. That doesn't change how I feel about you, but I know I have to move on. At least I will always be able to console myself with memories. I will never forget what it felt like to hold you in my arms, to kiss you, to tell you how much I loved you.""

What the WHAT NOW? YOU DID WHAT? Of course, this had NEVER happened between us. Never in a million YEARS. I don't think I had ever even touched the guy casually, because he gave me the willies. I was freaked out, called in my housemates and showed it to them; they were freaking out too, suddenly realising that if this guy was genuinely delusional this was a bigger problem than we all thought.

That, of course, is when it hits me: this guy knows where I live. He's been to a party at my house before. 

Suddenly the constant barking of my small dog begins to freak me out; one of my other housemates is so concerned she runs straight to the front door and checks it. Unfortunately, our front door lock is broken; it has a chain that holds, but the door itself had a habit of popping open against the chain. None of us are happy and we all vow to check the doors when we go past.

My consolation is that I'm about to leave the country for a two month vacation. I therefore email Morris back, for the first time. I don't tell him I'm going away, I just tell him that I don't know what he thinks has happened between us, but I am not interested, never have been interested in him, have never even replied to a single message from him, and basically have never touched him and WOULD never touch him. I even use the word 'delusional,' because not only am I scared, I am MAD. I end my message by telling him that I blocking him from all my social media and that I do not, under any circumstances, want him to talk to me again, not even to apologise. Just leave me alone.

I thought that would be the end of it, because honestly. Who gets stalked by a Morris dancer, for crying out loud?

Nope. I'm about a month into my vacation abroad and I check my email. My housemate has emailed me. I open it, eager from news from home... And she tells me that she's freaking out because yesterday Morris stood across the street from our house for 45 minutes. Staring. Directly. At it. For 45 minutes. Cool.

 I tell her that if it happens again, she should just call the cops to scare him off.

Eventually, I come home and audition for the summer theatre production. Well, guess who else gets a role? Morris. I haven't told any of our circle of friends about his weird behaviour, because honestly, again, I don't want to seem conceited, and I also feel like he has so few friends anyway, I don't want to ostracise him from them. He's weird enough as it is, right? People barely tolerate him as it is. 

But this is too much. Our summer theatre production is theatre in the park. A big, wide city park. A park with a lot of dark places and a lot of trees. A park where the carpark is quite some walk from the performance site, a walk right through these dark places and trees, and long rehearshals will mean multiple nights walking back to my car in the dark. With Morris out there somewhere. I told you he was a big guy; tall, and solid. Well, I'm a small girl. I'm petite. I was freaking out.

I bite the bullet and go to our middle-aged, male director, who I don't know from a bean, and tell him that I don't want to cause trouble but I'm scared of Morris because he has a slight history of JUST a little bit of stalking. I expect him to laugh it off. I even feel like I'm over-reacting; I mean, this was months ago now. But to my pleasant surprise, the director is actually very concerned. He takes it very seriously. Chivalrously, he even offers to kick Morris out of the production, but I'm too scared to agree to this.

 I don't want Morris mad at me for taking away one of his two social activities, because he's still going to know I'm here in the evenings rehearsing.  So the director agrees to let him stay as long as Morris promises not to talk to me, AT ALL. He also promises me that he will make sure I have an escort back to my car after rehearsals. Of course, word begins to get around, and I am approached by another cast member, who tells me ominously ""It's not the first time he's done this, you know.""

OH cool. Confirmation that he's really crazy. Just what I wanted.

Miraculously, I make it through the summer and not once does Morris even approach me, despite our dark evenings in the trees. I begin to stop worrying about the whole thing, but not quite so much that I don't check the locks on all the windows and doors before bed each night. When it's time for the end-of-production cast party, it's being held a block from my house... But I decide not to drink so that I can drive my car that one block, and not risk Morris following me home. It's been nearly a year since this started, and he hasn't spoken to me all summer, but this would be his last chance to do something crazy.

A few days later I was moving out of my hometown permanently, to a new country. Everyone knew it, and I was looking forward to the party because it was going to be the last time I hung out with a lot of my friends. I noticed as soon as I got there that Morris was speedily downing beers in the corner, and I was ignoring him just fine until about an hour later. He came up to me and disrupted another girl who was talking to me mid-sentence. He's looming over me, invading my personal space, and I'm feeling my heart jump.

""So, I guess now that you're leaving forever, it's okay for me to talk to you again,"" he says in his weird, nervous, breathy voice. 

I realise stuff at the party is slowing down and everyone is turning to look at us, just like in a movie.

I just stare at him for a second, and then give a very loud ""NO. IT ISN'T."" Then I deliberately turn back to the girl I was talking to, making it clear that I am turning away from him.

I didn't expect that he would try to grab me. In front of everyone, Morris reaches out and grabs my shoulder, spinning me back to him, and he's just screaming into my face ""I GUESS YOU'RE JUST A BITCH, THEN! YOU ARE SUCH A BITCH!""

Nobody had expected this quiet guy to snap like that, but within seconds every male member of production at the party, including the director, has grabbed him, and every female member is pulling me back away from him and huddling themselves around me. My first reaction is shock, followed not by fear but by anger, again, and most of all, gratitude. I have never seen such an instant display of support from a group of people. They're all outraged for me, worried, reassuring.  And now everyone knows he's indisputably bugnuts.

The guys drag him off and there are noises about kicking him out. I'd love that idea, if not for the fact that somewhere between me and my house, a mere block away, Morris might be waiting, furious and drunk. It's just safer if I leave. My farewells are spoiled by the whole thing, but I make the rounds, make my goodbyes to all my friends, drive home, lock the doors, and two days later I leave the country. Fortunately, I've never seen or heard from Morris since.

I don't go back to my home town often, but when I do, I have a vague sense of unease that perhaps I will run into him somewhere. My friends have warned me, jokingly: one dark night somewhere on the street, I'll be walking along, alone, and then I'll hear it. Softly behind me jingling somewhere... The sound of Morris bells."	t5_2t3t8	True
1368080016.0	1dzjnm	We almost didn't get inside the house in time.	braveliltoaster11	147	29	24	"So I just discovered this subreddit today, and while I should be studying for my chemistry test tomorrow, I thought you guys would appreciate the story of what happened to a friend and I a few years ago.

About four years ago, I was in my senior year of college and lived in what could be called a ""party house"". I lived with five other roommates, and because there were so many of us plus friends who would just stop by, the house was almost never empty. 

So anyway, one night I am by myself in the house and it is just pouring outside, lightning and thunder and everything. This is pretty unusual, being central California, plus the house being empty had put me a bit on edge. To make up for the quiet, I decide to play a little rock band by myself. While I am doing this, all of a sudden the lights go completely out. Now of course, I feel ridiculous about this, but I get pretty nervous and start to imagine things creeping around, so I use the light from my rock band guitar to go down the hallway, find my purse in my bedroom, and grab my phone.

I call my friend Jennifer and tell her all the lights are out, and ask if they're out at her place. She says no, so I tell her I am coming over cause I don't like being in the empty house all in the dark. I go over, she suggests we go to a party down the street, so I offer to be DD since I will need to drive back to my place later anyway. So we go to this party for maybe 2 hours, I have only one beer while she knocks down quite a few and some shots, then we leave so I can drop her off and go home.

By now it has stopped raining so when we get to her place, I park and she asks me if I want to have a cigarette with her before leaving. I say yes, so we both get out, and light our cigarettes and start to chat while standing in front of her townhouse. She lives in a generally quiet part of town, and being probably 1 am there is no one else around, even though her place is on an intersection between two streets.

Anyway, as we're chatting, I notice this guy a fair distance off, across the intersection walking down the middle of the street. He is tall with a pale face and curly black hair, and wearing tight black pants and what looks like a black sweater or turtleneck. Even though it's a little weird, I ignore him and we keep chatting. As we're smoking, Jennifer and I see him light up a cigarette of his own and keep walking our way (he's maybe 100 feet away at this point). 

Now at this point I'm still not worried, thinking it's a college town, maybe he's drunk and just wants to socialize with two girls, plus there's two of us and one of him. But as he gets closer he still doesn't say anything even though he's staring right at the two of us. Both of us glance at each other, feeling that nervous twitter in your stomach that you feel when something's not quite right. But we do our best not to stare back at him, thinking if he wants to come hang out, he'll say something and come over, maybe he's just shy or something. 

So we go back to chatting, and for just a moment I forget that he was there. Jennifer's pretty drunk and not paying as much attention, so when I remember, I look back over slyly, trying to see where he went. 

And he is gone. Just disappeared. I whisper to her and ask her if she saw where he went and she just shrugs but seems a little weirded out too. We're not quite done with our cigarettes but I tell her maybe we should finish them in the courtyard (the implication being that it would be safer in there). So she walks over to the wooden fence and as we're trying to open it, I look back right across the street from us. 

At first I think I see nothing, then I notice a thin plume of smoke floating up from behind a minivan parked directly across from us. I'm momentarily confused but it is then that I see his eyes. Crouching down in silence behind the minivan, his eyes are just peeking over the window, looking through both windows of the minivan and staring directly at me. Without breaking eye contact he takes another drag and silently exhales, the plume rising again above the minivan.

Now is when I realize something is really not right and that we need to get inside immediately. Jennifer has gotten the wooden gate open and we hurry into the tiny courtyard and I tell her we need to go inside right now, so she goes to open the sliding glass door but it won't budge. It's locked. The wooden gate has started to swing closed when I realize we need to go through it again, towards the man, in order to get into the house. 

So I pull the gate open and she is digging around in her purse trying to find her keys, laughing kind of nervously because she's pretty drunk and doesn't really understand the gravity of the situation. She finally pulls her keys out, and then drops them on the ground. At this point I look over and the man in all black has stood up and is walking around the side of the minivan towards the front. I start looking for anything I could use as a weapon, but the only thing in sight is a red metal post pounder, that's too far in his direction and looks like it would be too heavy to grab and swing at him. 

The man's now in front of the van. Jennifer has picked up the keys, but she has probably 6 different keys on her ring and a few of them look the same. She puts the wrong one in first and laughs extremely nervously when it doesn't turn, her hands shaking as she pulls out the key. Meanwhile I look back up and the man is staring straight at me, and starts to walk towards us, with a half-smile that doesn't reach his eyes, like he's a cat who is crouching waiting to jump on a mouse, and it terrifies me. He still says nothing, and I realize that if he reaches us, something terrible will happen. 

I feel a rush of energy and fright as I move closer to Jennifer and the door, but in between her and him. Jennifer whispers to me, asking if he's coming towards us. She is staring at her keys, figures out which one it is and is fumbling around trying to put the key in. I have a realization that if I tell her the truth, she won't be able to get the door open, so I quickly whisper ""No"" back to her as he is walking directly towards me, only about  10-15 feet away. I can see his hair rustle slightly as he takes another step, his arm starting to reach up. I feel every nerve in my body tense, wired up, my brain screaming at me to run away, and then it happens. 

The doorknob turns. The door gives and starts to swing inward and I shove Jennifer in, pulling myself in by the corner of the doorway as fast as I can physically manage. I grab the handle and slam the door shut, my hands slippery as I lock the door lock and the deadbolt. She stumbles and grabs onto the stair railing and I look at her and say, ""We need to get upstairs!""

We run up the stairs, adrenaline pumping, get to her room, and close the door. That's when I tell her that he was actually walking towards us. She looks at me terrified, and then asks if we should call the cops. My heart is pounding in my ears as I'm listening for any signs that he's trying to make it inside the house, or climb up to the window, but I can't hear anything and it's suddenly incredibly hard to think. Finally I nod, and she digs her phone out and calls the cops.

Normally I hate the cops in this town, because they just go after drunk college kids since there is very little real crime. However, that day we were so thankful that they responded so quickly. Jennifer explained the situation on the phone as I (in slight terror) checked the window, but didn't see any sign of him. The operator was kind enough to stay on the phone with us while we waited for the cops. 

We waited in near silence for about five minutes, listening for any sign that he was still coming after us, before I saw the red and blue lights reflecting off the window. The loud knock on the door startled us, but we cautiously went downstairs and I opened the door after looking through the peephole and seeing it was a police officer with a maglite. We explained what happened and the cops spent a decent amount of time looking for him, but they were never able to find him. He just disappeared."	t5_2t3t8	True
1365536224.0	1c0cyr	Pillow Case	golightly25	141	21	21	"I used to live in a small housing development on the edge of my city.  We were surrounded by fields, and the main road up to our suburb had forests on both sides of the street.  It was poorly lit; it wasn't a high income area so if the bulbs in the streetlamps blew, the council didn't replace them for weeks at a time.

One evening in winter I had been collected from school by my grandparents.  14-year-old female me assured them that I would be fine walking up the road to my house.  I'd done it thousands of times (in daylight) and they were just sitting down to dinner so I didn't want to trouble them.  For some reason, they agreed and told me to phone them as soon as I got home.

I switched my clunky school shoes for my trainers and set off.  In retrospect, I was stupid to make the walk alone but at least I decided to leave my mp3 player in my bag so I could be more aware of my surroundings.

Before my encounter, I felt most scared before I had actually started up the main road.  With the trees crowding either side, barely any lights, and branches obstructing the lights that did work, it was almost pitch black.  It was only once I was under the canopy and my eyes started to adjust that I felt more secure.

I was about two thirds of the way along, thinking about taking out my iPod once I was clear of the woods.  I was having a little daydream about which band to listen to and wondering what I'd have for dinner, when I heard a faint, high-pitched squeaking noise to my right.  I didn't slow my pace but I peered curiously through the trees and didn't see anything unusual.  What the hell was that noise though?

I shrugged it off as some kind of critter and was calling myself a paranoid idiot when I heard it again, to the right, but this time further in front of me.  Whatever had made the noise was going faster than me but not making a sound.  You know, twigs snapping, leaves rustling, nothing.  Except this time, the weird noise was slightly clearer because I was paying attention.  It sounded like someone was crying.

I am not a naive person.  I am a worst-case-scenario kinda thinker, and I promptly shat a brick, figuring something bad was about to happen.

I started to speed up and then STOMPSTOMPSTOMP, this guy comes running out of the woods and jumps to a stop right in front of me, facing me.  He is completely nude below the waist, save for a pair of socks.  He has a pillow case over his head with a big ovular eyehole cut out of it and he is thrusting his hips at me, making his flaccid peeper slap up and down.  With each thrust he makes this high-pitched noise, amplified, ""REEEEE-HE-HE-HE!!""

I was too startled to even scream.  My split-second immediate reaction was to run across the road on the diagonal so I was still in the direction of home.  Luckily (unluckily?!) there wasn't any traffic at all and I ran full pelt until I had passed the last tree on the left and my breath was ragged.  I chanced a look over my shoulder but couldn't see him.

I physically couldn't maintain my sprint any more, but I managed to jog to the nearest building with lights; the petrol station on the corner of my housing estate.  We called the police and I gave a statement, but because all I'd seen of the creeper was his dick, I knew they wouldn't have much chance of catching him.  Sure enough when my mum followed up with the police, they had swept the woods immediately and he was nowhere to be found.

The aftermath, well.  My mum gave me hell for walking alone after dark and I wasn't trusted with much independence for a good few months.  It could have been much worse.  It's a story that I nervously laugh about when I tell my friends these days, but it was one of the most unsettling things that's ever happened to me.

**TL:DR** - Walking past some woods when a mostly naked guy jumped out at me with a pillowcase on his head."	t5_2t3t8	True
1357844526.0	16bty8	Inviting them into your apartment's usually a bad idea	bankergoesrawrr	195	76	35	"When I was in college, I was president of the Asian Pacific Student Association (APSA). During one event, this girl came up to me and snidely pointed out this girl who was standing alone in a corner and told me how she would show up to every event all alone. I thought she was being a complete bitch, and being a former wallflower myself, I decided to talk to that girl and introduce her to everyone.

At first, I thought the reason she had no friends was because people can be pretty mean to obese and really ugly people. Turns out there was a valid reason.

One day, I found her outside my apartment. Since I was the APSA president, this wasn't too weird. I let everyone know I have an open door policy, so I often have people coming over to borrow my kitchen, sleep in between classes, study, etc. I invited her in. 

The conversation was weird. It's like she has this idea of how ""popular"" girls act (bitchy) and she's thinks she should act that way. I started getting annoyed, so I told her I needed to study and she should just leave. I opened the front door for her, but she made no move to leave. Long awkward silence as I hold the door open for her, and her sitting on my couch and not moving at all. She went, ""It's ok, I can be quiet.""

I should have called for help now, but somehow I missed the warning sign. I left the door and pointedly started studying. I eventually forgot she was there. 2 chapters later, I looked up and holy shit she was still there. STARING at me. Just staring and smiling this creepy smile.

So I told her, ""Well, you're probably hungry and want to go home for dinner now. I'm cooking dinner *for one*."" I actually cooked dinner for just myself and ignored her when she talked to me while I ate. 

Finally, I told her she should really, really leave because I needed a shower. I marched to my bathroom in the most non-inviting way possible, but she followed me anyway. She shouted through the door as I showered. She didn't even make any attempt to leave when I got out in my towel.

By then, I had to physically shove her out of my apartment, which was rather hard since she's morbidly obese and I'm much smaller than her.

Played SC2 for a bit and forgot about her. My room-mate eventually came back. 

""Um, do you know why there's a girl pacing outside our apartment?""


From then onwards she would keep waiting outside my apartment. It got to the point where I had to hide in my friends' apartments until my room-mate told me it was safe. Finally I solved the issue. I really shouldn't be proud of this, but.....I introduced her to all my guy friends. 

When she tells me, ""I think X likes me..."" (somehow she thought any guy who was paid any attention to her was into her)

I would go, ""Really? You know, I don't believe in girls waiting for guys to make the first move. If you're into someone, you should just make a move...""

2 of my friends became her new stalking targets. One of them no longer talks to me. I really should feel more guilty about that.

I grew up in a small town in Ohio, I lived in a little house with only 2 other homes on the block. We lived a short (like 3 minutes) bike ride away from a park by a river. My brother, his friend (who also lived on our block) and myself would ride to the park and play. 

On our way home one day I got ahead of the boys and was about a minute from home waiting, they were messing around trying to ramp onto the bridge. A black van pulled up to me in the parking lot I was waiting in and the driver looked like my brothers friends step dad so I said ""Hey! They're still on the bridge"" the man said ""That's ok, get in and we'll get ice cream."" I stood there for a minute confused, why would he not care what the boys were doing??? 

The boys rode up and the guy drove away. My brother asked who I was talking to and I realized it wasn't the step dad so we rode home fast. In the next couple of weeks we saw that the police were looking for a man on the news the Sketch looked like my brothers friends step dad and I told my mom that I thought it was the guy who had talked to me and she informed the police. Once the man was caught I found out that he was wanted for the murder of 2 girls a little older than me a few towns away. His name is William Sapp. I imagine that I could very easily have been one of his victims that day."	t5_2t3t8	True

This formality was just to get everything setup, fill out paper work, meet my co-workers, etc. Well, that's where my story begins...


Day 1, I arrive precisely on time. I was given a warm welcome and introduced to the rest of the staff. Shortly after my arrival, a second character pulls into the driveway in this blue minivan. I instinctually note his vehicle choice: ""must be a family man"", I think to myself as I watch him walk up to the front door. My employer greets the newcomer and a similar welcome is exchanged with the stranger. It appears I wasn't the only one who got hired for this position after all.


The man is escorted up the stairs and introduced to me as one *Josh Powell*. I silently judge people upon first meeting them and this guy made it to ""possible child molester"" within seconds of talking to him. Something was clearly off, but I attributed his odd behavior to aspergers or something. 


It didn't take long before I saw the full scale of Josh Powell's social oddities. He had a propensity for talking over people (including the boss), stealing the spotlight, peppering his comments with manipulative phrases that made him look good, and acting generally douchey. Again, I associated it with some form of social inhibition. 


After we were given the grand tour of our new company, everyone was treated to a delicious lunch at a local restaurant. Things got interesting at that point... My new co-worker manipulated odd topics into conversation which I took note of. He made sure to stress his love for his children (in a forced, unnatural way), iterated over his need for controlling finances (I have no idea how he brought that up), and was fairly curt to the waiter who served us our food. The meal itself went over well enough, but I kept noticing these subtle comments and behavior traits that Josh Powell radiated. 


Before the day was over, I had grown accustomed to cringing every time Josh opened his mouth. He was always rude, loud, and generally obnoxious. He made comments about things he *clearly* had no knowledge of and this was just day 1! Something is definitely off about this man.


After getting home, I went on to my computer and had the brilliant idea to look up my new co-worker on facebook. Maybe I could get some additional info about him? For whatever reason (perhaps fate?) I did a standard search and facebook decided to look at news articles instead of people. Seconds after the search completed my eyes got big. ""Holy shit"" I thought to myself as I read the article. ""Josh Powell - Husband suspected of murdering wife."" I look closer at the picture and nearly had a heart attack from shock. That was *indeed* the man who I now considered my new co-worker.


I became obsessed with his case and was really tempted to try and befriend him in an effort to solve the murder mystery. I didn't get a chance, though. Jump forward almost exactly a year later and my hatred for him quickly skyrocketed until his untimely demise. He took an axe to his two children (whom he *always* talked about) and then blew up his house and died of asphyxiation.


Sometimes I wish I had taken the risk and tried to solve his case... I had many opportunities. In fact, 2 days before he went postal I had talked on the phone with him and scheduled a meeting to help him learn some programming concepts (because he was never really good at programming). I kind of got depressed after he killed his kids and felt really shitty for not noticing some of the signs beforehand. (That was almost a year ago, I have long since come to terms with the reality of things).


He was definitely one of the creepiest people I've ever met..."	t5_2t3t8	True
1348208847.0	108k6r	Mall Creeper	luckynumber3	133	13	9	"This is something that happened to me as an 8 year old about 12 years ago. At the time my sister was in dance class (nothing too serious as she was only 3, yes they have dance classes for 3 year olds) and the dance school was doing a performance at a local mall. My mother personally doesn't like this mall at all, mostly because it's known as a gang stomping ground, but a commitment is a commitment so she took us.


Once they finished setting up the dance area my sister started ""performing"" (by which I mean her and the other small children just shook their hips and spun in circles) a man came up behind me.


He had only been there for a couple minutes when my mom glanced over and hissed at me, ""Luckynumber3, get over here now!"" I, being an oblivious child, asked why. ""Just do it!"" I, being a stubborn and slightly stupid child, stood my ground unless she told me why. At this point my mother grabbed me by the arm and hauled me away forcibly. I later saw the man being handcuffed by police officers and led away.


Obviously my mother didn't tell me why she dragged me away at the time. I found out a few years ago when she brought it up again (I believe the context of the conversation was something about being aware of surroundings, and to be honest I had forgotten about the entire incident). Apparently he had been masturbating and staring at me."	t5_2t3t8	True
1345023300.0	y966q	[Comp]The Cash Cab Creeps		148	28	34	"This encounter happened just before summer of 2009 when I was 20 years old. My then boyfriend, Jason, had decided to surprise me with what should have been a lovely trip to San Diego. I came from a family that never had the money to travel or go on vacations, so I was rightfully excited to get out of Arizona and dip my toes in the ocean for the first time.


We never made it to San Diego. 4 hours into our drive we started experiencing mechanical problems. It started with a flat tire in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night. Jason was a mechanic, and we were back on the road in no time. After crossing over into California things started to really go downhill. 
Only 100 miles were between us and San Diego when the car decided to die completely. Jason flipped the hazard lights on and coasted over to the shoulder. Fortunately for us, California has call boxes on the side of the highway every mile. We watched the sun rise as we walked back half a mile to the last call box we saw. Jason had AAA and a tow truck was dispatched to the scene.


2 hours later (and one incident of the lovely California Highway Patrol pulling their guns on me for no reason) we were in the cab of the Tow Truck taking us back a few miles to a small town called El Centro. We were dropped off at a mechanic's shop where they told us it would be ""awhile"". I was bored and hungry by this time. Jason and I decided that we would walk the main streets and window shop while looking for a place to get some food.

 
We hadn't been walking more than a few blocks when I heard a voice coming from behind me.
""Can I have me one of them cigarettes?"" an old woman said directly. Jason was a social guy, so he obliged this woman's request and we stood there and made awkward small talk for what seemed like eternity. I didn't feel right about this woman. She was average height for a woman, a little on the thin side and maybe between 50-60 years of age. Her face was aged prematurely and I noticed she didn't have many teeth. Her clothes looked like they were purchased at a Goodwill in 1995, and her dirty blonde mullet hung in unkempt clumps in front of her eyes.

 
Her and Jason got to talking about the situation with the car, and that we were stranded in town for awhile and very hungry.
""I live just down the street. Do ya'll wanna come over and sit in the air conditioning for awhile? We can order pizza."" the woman says.


Every inch of me wanted to just say no, but Jason had exuberantly responded, ""Sure we do! Thank you for offering.""


The woman turned on a dime and started walking briskly down the sidewalk. Jason grabbed my hand and we followed. Every few minutes she would look back and assure us that we would be there soon. I told Jason I didn't feel right about it, but he told me not to worry and that he would protect me if harm came my way.


We finally get to her house. It is a little on the small side, but it looks no different than any other house in the neighborhood. Once inside we are immediately greeted by a man (her boyfriend or husband). He is around the same age as the woman, prematurely aged with not many teeth. He was taller than me and Jason, but he was also very thin and lanky. He had medium length salt-and-pepper hair that looked as if it had never seen the contents of a shampoo bottle.


These people just rubbed me the wrong way. The man was very insistent on getting a drink for me. He came and sat down on the couch in the small space between Jason and I, totally invading my personal bubble. At this point I am screaming on the inside and the creep factor is through the roof. I asked the woman if I could use her bathroom. She led me down the hallway to the most disgusting bathroom I have ever been in. The toilet hadn't been cleaned in what looked like a year, and dirty towels took up most of the floor space. The trash was overflowing.


I was eavesdropping in the bathroom. I resisted the urge to snoop through their things, so listening at the door was the next best thing. The woman was talking in a loud voice. It sounded like she was ordering a pizza for delivery, ""Yes a large pepperoni. Okay. Okay. so expect between twenty and thirty minutes? Okay. Thank you. Bye.""


I decided not to use the restroom or wash my hands and cool off my face like originally planned. I exited the bathroom just in time to see the woman put the phone back down on the side table, and go take her seat in a wooden stool near the kitchen. When I went back to the front room, creepy man was sitting on most of the side of the couch I previously occupied. He was mindlessly flipping through channels on the small old television set.

 
""ALRIGHT! CASH CAB IS ON!"" he yelled out in delight, ""DO YOU LIKE CASH CAB? COME WATCH CASH CAB WITH ME!"" he beamed when he saw me.


I found myself sitting uncomfortably on the couch as far away from this man as I physically could. After the host of the game show would ask a trivia question, the old man would loudly blurt out an incorrect answer. Jason and the woman had also been calling out answers so I decided it was safe to join in talking to the tv.


After 5 or 6 correct answers in a row for me, the man's mood turned from enthusiastic and playful to angry and callous. I decided to stop answering the trivia questions. I sat in silence for fifteen minutes while the episode came to an end, and a new one started.


""Why aren't you playing the cash cab with me anymore, girl?"" the old man persists with a rude tone in his voice.


Suddenly there was a terrible pain in my forearm. With lightning speed (and superhuman strength) the old man had grabbed me by the right forearm and was screaming in my face:


""DO YOU THINK YOU'RE BETTER THAN ME? HUH?!?!? DO YOU?!?! YOU LITTLE BITCH!""


Jason was on his feet in a second, and I was in silent tears and crippled by overwhelming fear and disbelief. The man let go of my arm while simultaneously trying to shove me to the ground. I reached over to the table on the side of the couch nearest me and grabbed their wireless home telephone. 
My fingers fumbled as I frantically tried to dial 911. I put the phone up to my ear.


Nothing.
The phone was out of service completely. Dead. No dice.

 
I exchanged panicked looks with Jason, who was now trying to wrestle the man away from me. 
""Jason! Get up now, get up and run!"" I screamed as I stumbled to my feet and flung myself across the living room and into the front door. The door leading to freedom.


I couldn't seem to do three easy things: unchain the chain lock, unlock the deadbolt, and open the door to get away. Jason was throwing wild left handed punches at the advancing man while he was simultaneously  fumbling with the chain and lock.

 
High pitched cackles were emanating from the old, haggard woman who was now walking slowly towards the door. Towards us. Her face was mad. She was smiling wickedly, showing off her five jagged teeth. The man slowly got back to his feet too. They were both advancing at us, slowly but not breaking eye contact.
The next thing I know Jason had pushed me through the now open doorway into freedom. I bolted across the stepping stones and didn't even bother opening the small white wooden gate at the end of the walkway. I just jumped over it like I was hurdling in the 100 Meter Dash or Death.


Jason was a bigger guy, and out of shape, but he was thundering down the sidewalk after me. I glanced back to see the old man snarling at me through the doorway. I could still hear those shrill, piercing shrieks of laughter coming from the house.

 
""Got somethin' for you, bitch!"" he screamed at me.

 
My memory gets sort of choppy from here. I know I was already across the street waiting for Jason to catch up with me so  we could get out of there. I know I watched that sinister old man crossing the front lawn in large strides with what looked like a hypodermic needle clenched tightly in his fist.
Jason and I started running together. I sort of knew the general way back to the car mechanic since I took in all the details of our walk to that house earlier. Every couple of blocks we would turn down, I would cast a quick glance over my shoulder to see if they were coming.

 
When we got to the mechanic, our car was parked outside in the front. I clawed the door to the office open and had a quick exchange with the mechanic about the car being ready to go and how much I owed for the repairs. I thrust all of the cash I had in my wallet (about $400) into his hands and snatched my key off the counter.

 
Jason was already getting in the driver seat. I dove into the passenger seat and jammed the keys into the ignition.

 
""Go!"" I bellowed.


Jason turned the key and the car sprang into life. We peeled rubber trying to make a quick exit out of that parking lot. Out of that town. I decided to do one more ""creep check"" glance back to see if they were in pursuit of us. I can't be too sure, but there were definitely two people down at the very end of the street heading our direction. My last memory of this glorious vacation was rolling up my window and turning on the radio to drown out the sounds of high pitched laughter coming from a distance as we hit the I-8 east back to Phoenix."	t5_2t3t8	True
1343063306.0	x0vgj	"Old Guys in Speedos Aren't Always ""Trying to be Young""..."	MagentaParrot	147	32	19	"Okay, so back in 2008 (when I lived in Kentucky) we went for a weekend up at a campground about 2 hours from our house.  Twin Knobs was my FAVORITE place to go all through childhood.  It had a little beach setup right at the lake where a good portion of the visible water was buoy'ed for swimmers.  
This particular time, my cousin Anna had come along with us.  We were swimming out to the border when we spotted this old man.  Not thinking anything of it, we continued to wade around.  I looked back and saw the old man swimming under the boundary line, then popping back up to laugh like a lunatic.  I gave my cousin ""the look"" and we made our way back to shore as unnoticeable as possible.  I looked behind me to see the freak with his mouth under water, following us insanely close.  I yelped and we made a mad-dash to my mom on the shore.
    We ran over to tell the lifeguard.  He was about 18 or so and looked almost hungover.  We pointed out the guy (who was still in the water) and he told us he couldn't do anything about it because he hadn't seen him.  Just then, the guy came out of the water in a speedo and laid down on the sand.    The lifeguard laughed and said ""Old coot thinks he's hot.""  We rolled our eyes and went back to my mom, carefully avoiding the sight of the freak.  

   We got lunch and then walked up the hill to leave.  Just as we got to the car, Anna looked over and saw the old guy on the ground, naked.  He was sticking his hand under a car tire.  He got up and did this about 3 more times to different cars until he came back up with a key.  My mom was on the phone with 911 while we all hid behind a random SUV.  He unlocked the car and sat inside.  It was a silver volvo with a fucking sorority sticker on the back.  

  He got out of the car with a camera and took pictures of people's license plates, including ours.  He got back in and sped away, out of the parking lot.  We had to stay and extra 2 hours at the ranger station so my mom could help fill out the police report.  And that concludes my experience with a lunatic. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1342805052.0	wvs9c	The 71/2 foot tall Man	XxmsmaliciousxX	152	36	48	"This was about 10 years ago now. 

I was walking down the street with 2 buddies of mine. We just had a wicked dinner, and we were heading to a friends for a party. Now, I'm in downtown Calgary. It's brightly lit where we were, a few people around, nothing too crazy for a Tuesday. Anyways, we are absorbed in our conversation, and I get this weird feeling that someone was watching/following us. 

I turn my head and look behind us, sure enough, about a block away from us is a guy that looks mean. He looks about 6 1/2 feet tall, covered in tattoos, Bald, combat boots, the regular punk gear. Us being punks too we didn't think too much of it. But me being 5 foot nothing, 90 lbs on a rainy day holding a brick if I'm lucky, was thoroughly creeped out. 

So we keep walking, and I turn back to see if he's still there. Sure enough he was now speed walking toward us. Closing the gap pretty quickly. The next time I had looked he was right behind us and he looked beyond mad. So I do the logical thing and run. Just took right off. My buddies scattered. I hear this guy behind me and start screaming for him to back off, and what did I do??

So he catches up to me, and scoops me up. By this time, no word of a lie, he is not the 6 1/2 feet I thought. He's 7 1/2 feet of angry punk. He growls and throws me into a garbage can and proceeds to kick the can over. All the while with me screaming. Finally, I stop being rolled around and kicked. He pulls me out and apologizes, says he thought I was someone else. Dusts me off and walks away. 

I was pretty angry myself at this point and I marched up to him. Since I literally basically come up to his ribcage, I punched him in the butt and told him he should make sure he knows who someone is before just randomly beating people. He laughed and just kept walking. Never seen him again. 

My buddies ended up running to the party and left my butt. I just went home. 


Creeps.

1342480105.0	wo4rv	ReverseLetsNotMeet, or when did you last creep someone out?		146	25	146	"So I'm homeless.  I live in the woods near a bridge (IN A VAN DOWN BY THE RIVER - though not really, just thought that would be funny).  I get wifi through libraries, or in the local Safeway, which closes at 1:00 AM and has a Starbucks inside.  I charge my laptop in the same places, and in gazebos and public parks, though I try to avoid them when the weather is nice and people are around, as I don't want the cops to snatch me up and beat me to death.

Anyways, I have the place to myself during the Fall, Winter, and Spring, because it's coastal Oregon and it rains all the time and is cold.  But when it's nice out, the place is crawling with people, and every single one of them look at me like I'm their worst nightmare, whatever that happens to be.

This fat woman who jogs in the park and on the railroad tracks with her dog has seen me three times.  When she saw me this morning, as I stumbled out of the wooded path and onto the asphalt jogging path, she literally grabbed her dog (who was pooping) by the collar and ran away from me, as fast as she could.

Needless to say, I fucking hate everyone I see, because of little incidents like this.  I talk to myself too, sometimes (boredom), and once in a while someone will walk around a corner and catch me doing it, which doesn't help.

Anyways, my most recent creeper encounter, which for once didn't take place inside another person's imagination, took place at the public boardwalk, where I eat my dinner because there's a restroom nearby where I can wash my hands afterwards.

This guy walks up to me, and starts talking to me.  Fat guy, mid to late 20's, talking about how nice the park is.  I presume he's gonna ask me to come into his truck so he can blow me or something, but I'm trying to eat my dinner so I can't tell him to fuck off until I have my shit put away, so I can run and hide.

So I make one-word replies, hoping he takes the hint.  He doesn't.  It turns out that he isn't trolling for cock, but is instead one of those dead-seriously earnest types who wants to give me his pocket change.  For the first time in my career as a homeless person, I refuse the proffered change, just in case he's a careful gay who's waiting for me to feel obligated to him before he gets creepy.

****

Other than those fairly mild encounters, the only creepy thing I've done the past week is to leave a note for a homeless guy who left a mess in the woods, telling him to ""CLEAN UP YOUR MESS OR GET OUT"".  Later that night, I heard someone screaming, so I assume he found my message.  When I went by there yesterday, most of the mess was gone, but he was still ""hiding"" his stuff in plain sight.

What do you guys need for proof that I'm homeless?  A picture of my campsite?  My pack and clothes and stuff, unpacked?

Anyways, post your stories of times that YOU were the creep - deliberate or accidental."	t5_2t3t8	True
1342055092.0	wf079	Were they really policemen?	bluepills0808	131	11	36	"This happened to me and my family about 2 years ago (2010) This happened during the summer. 

( I was asleep during most of the incident so i will retell what my mom told me, and then what i remember) 
My mom was asleep like any other night. She woke up to go to the bathroom, and as she was sitting, there was really loud knocking on the door. She looked at the clock in the hallway and saw that it was 2 in the morning. She crept to the guest bedroom to look out of the window and saw that it was three very tall white men in police uniforms. So she went back to her room and woke my dad up that the police were here.

My dad woke up and they both went to the entrance of the house to see the policemen. They opened the door and the policemen said that they had received a call coming from our house about someone hiding out in the house. My parents still groggy, just said it wasn't us and that they didn't make the call. The policeman insisted about the call and that they had to check the place out. Us having nothing to hide my parents said yes, and let them in. The three men checked every room in the house, one of the men entered my room as I was sleeping walked around my bed and looked in my closet then left.

As this point i woke up from all of the commotion, I walked up to my mom and she quickly told me what was going on. They checked the back yard and told us that the found nothing, they were going to leave and we could go back to sleep. 

My dad escorted them out and they left. As my dad closed and locked the door, my mom was really nervous. She said to us ""Did any of you notice that one of the policemen had his entire arm covered in tattoos?"" ( I guess 'cause it was during the summer they were wearing summer uniforms with short sleeves) We turned off all of the lights and decided to lookout one of the windows. 

The three men walked off of our property and down the street. As they walked away we all realized that there wasn't a copcar, nor bikes, nothing they walked down the street until we couldn't see them anymore. We were all equally freaked out and double checked everything was locked. We really didn't sleep that night, and just sat in the dining room discussing what had happened. 

They never cameback and nothing happened after that. But we all still think it was wayyyy too weird, and too out of the blue. We didnt think of calling the cops, or anyone to see if they were real cops or not. We also realized they never showed us ID, and we never really asked for it.

At least nothing happened, and we just got a scare that night. But I do still wonder if they really were cops."	t5_2t3t8	True
1333558219.0	rt3wm	[My] ex-neighbour makes the news.	atomic_bobomb	141	23	29	"Edit: I have put the picture back up of the police cruisers outside of the apartment because the story just isn't the same without it.  Anyways, the picture of the article will remain down.  I like my privacy way too much.

There is this house on the corner of two very busy highways in my town that had been converted into two apartments; bachelor apartment upstairs and two bedroom downstairs.  My boyfriend, Alex, rented the lower apartment for a year, but when he lost his room mate he decided to downsize and take the apartment upstairs.  The landlord was a rich bastard and put no money into these apartments so there was no soundproofing, sinks with a separate hot tap and a cold tap, windows that were a foot wide, no doors on any of the rooms, the fridge and stove were about 20 years old and the apartment was on a steep angle.  For $350 a month though, it fit my boyfriend's budget at the time and the location was very convenient.

Eventually an older couple in their 40s named Deb and Luke move into the apartment downstairs.  We got along great with them at first; smoked a few joints with them, had a few beers, talked, and Alex even helped Luke with his laptop.  The first month they did a lot of celebrating with alcohol and a lot of sexy timing, but my boyfriend and I didn't complain.  It was their first apartment together and who were we to ruin their excitement?  Eventually the party came to an end for them and the honeymoon phase of moving in together had quickly ended.  They were fighting all the time, Luke would blast his techno music all day, the amount of alcohol they were drinking increased rapidly and eventually my boyfriend and I stopped interacting with them as much.  It didn't help though since the building had no sound proofing whatsoever; we heard all the fights, every word of them.

Soon Luke started building himself a little area outside where he could sit.  He built a small fire pit, bought a cheap patio set and would often invite us to drink out there with him.  We would join him if we some beer in the apartment and the weather was nice.  He wasn't a bad guy to talk to, just very dumb.  One night he invited us to sit with him and have a beer because he had exciting news: Deb was expecting their first child.  Awesome.  The spawn of Satan is going to live below us.  They continued to fight and argue all the time, Luke would blast his music to drown out Deb and eventually go outside to cool down by his fire pit.

Fast forward nine months and she pops out the demon.  Things went from bad to hell in a matter of weeks.  They were fighting more frequently, Luke was often drunk and stoned, Alex and I had already gotten into a few altercations with them over us being too loud with our friends (we tried to be quiet, but after the alcohol gets flowing it is often hard to exercise volume control).  Soon it progressed to the point where Luke would purposely blast his music while Alex was trying to sleep.  I can remember one incident where I was attempting to fall asleep with Alex when Luke decided to start playing his music.  I took the speakers from the stereo, laid them flat on the ground and started playing some of my boyfriend's music to  see how much Luke liked it.  He didn't.  Soon the texts start coming (these are paraphrased as my boyfriend didn't save the texts):

""I can keep this up all night.""

My boyfriend passed the phone off to me and went back to sleep.  I told Luke that as long as he is playing his music then I would continue to play mine since Alex was trying to sleep and had to be up at 5 am.

""Oh good, I am talking to his old lady.  Why don't you come down here and we can settle this once and for all.""

I tell him I am not going downstairs.

""Fuck you. Come down here and I will shut you up.""

I again tell him I am not going downstairs.  He is a forty-something year old man and he is attempting to start a fight with a 22 year old female who is half his weight.  He keeps texting me after that telling me how Deb has a problem with me and they all have a problem with me and that I should just get the fuck out and go away.  I don't know what prompted him to start attacking me, but I said ""fuck it"" and kept my music going.  Eventually I hear Deb yelling and I turn off the music (it was unfair to do that to Deb).  She's yelling at him for telling me that she has a problem with me and whatnot.  They fight for about an hour and Alex finally decides to put in earphones and doses off.

Things only escalated from there.  We started receiving more aggressive texts, Luke started leaving his empty tall boy cans on my car, on our porch and on the steps outside leading up to my boyfriend's apartment, and the music continued to blare while Alex was trying to sleep.  The fights had gotten to the point where it sounded like Luke had begun to hit Deb (she would cry, scream in pain and tell him not to touch her).  Luke also began yelling at me through the floor when I was home alone.  Telling me how I was useless and did nothing to contribute to my boyfriend's life so I wasn't welcome there and how I was welcome to come downstairs at any time and deal with him face to face.  He had a lot of pent up anger towards me.  I really wish my boyfriend had listened to me and saved some of the text messages he had sent to me.

A couple days later I arrive at the apartment after work around 9:30-10 pm.  Luke is sitting out by the fire pit with about four empty cans of beer laying around his chair.  I pull into the driveway and he shoots me a glare. As I get out of the car, Luke gets up from his chair and just stands there staring at me.  I decided to forego getting my laptop from the trunk and just run past Luke to the stairs.  He yells something and starts to take a step towards me, but I was already on the fourth step of the stairs and was now running up the rest of the stairs.

About 15-20 minutes later I hear a thump at the front door.  I asked Alex if he was expecting anyone and he told me that he wasn't so we ignored it and continued to watch TV.  I figured it was the screen door  since it had been broken in a windstorm a few months back and never really closed properly. Another 45 minutes go by and we hear Deb screaming ""PLEASE LET HIM GO!  OH PLEASE GOD LET HIM GO!""  I am on full ""what the fuck"" alert right now.  I peer out the back window and this is what I see at 11:15 pm:

http://imgur.com/DkcND

Now, these are not all the cop cruisers that were out there.  Four more cop cruisers were pulled around front, but unfortunately the street is right below the front window so I couldn't angle my phone to get a good shot of the other four cruisers.  This picture gives you an idea of where Luke was in relation to my car and the stairs leading up to that door I am taking a picture from.  It's about 20 feet from my car to the bottom of the stairs and half way in between is where Luke's little fire pit was located.

Now the kicker: our friend lives across the street and tried telling us what happened.  Someone had tried to break into the house downstairs and was apparently armed.  We go on thinking this is what happened.  I am scared out of my mind thinking that noise I heard at the front door was actually the robber trying to get into our apartment until the next day when I read this:

""O.P.P. have arrested and charged a 44-year old man in connection to a robbery and assault in [town removed]. Police say on Wednesday night a home owner came home to find his neighbour inside their house.  After a brief fight, the man broke free and fled the scene back to his house.  A short time later police located the man outside of his home and arrested him.  Charged with armed robbery, assault, break and enter and trespassing is Luke [last name removed].""

I am only sharing this because last night my boyfriend finally told me a little secret after a nice meal and a few drinks to celebrate moving into a new apartment.  When I walked past Luke that night and he had gotten up to walk towards me, he had already robbed and assaulted the guy.  I had walked right past him, made eye contact with him and he didn't even seem to care that he had just attacked someone for no reason.  

I am now convinced that the thump I heard that night was Luke opening the screen door and trying to open the front door.

1374286280.0	1io81y	Too broke for the bus	tuesdaysister2	152	34	21	"Hey all...this is one of my off hand experiences that was a bit nerve wracking at the time but thankfully, didn't turn crazy.

About five years ago, I (late 20s F, petite in height and build)was taking a lot of night classes at my local community college. I was only working part time, so often I'd run out of cash for a bus ticket (a monthly pass is $70, which was nearly half my paycheck some weeks), but it didn't bother me too much since I lived only about a mile and a half from the school.

The college is in a residential upbeat area, nicer town in an urban community. The street is a main drag, with a fair amount of traffic even after 9pm. There are only a couple blocks near a gated apartment complex that are pretty dark.

One night in the fall just as it was starting to get colder more quickly, I decided to save my money and just walk. I had my ipod on, with the hood of my XL sweater pulled up over my head. My silhouette isn't very curvy and generally I dress fairly tomboyish; I had long hair at the time but I felt confident that I would blend into the night. I had no purse just a backpack on my back.

Just as I was coming into the dark stretch, out of the shadows appeared a man (skinny and not much taller than me and I'm 5'4"") dressed in a shabby hoodie and shorts, looking like he was headed out for a beer run. Normally I would be alert but not paranoid especially since I knew there was a restaurant ahead of me and a gas station behind me if I needed to run--but something felt off, so I turned off my ipod, but kept the buds in my ears.  I could hear the man's footsteps as they trailed off a few yards, before they appeared to turn around towards my direction. 

I kept my pace steady, felt for my cellphone in my front pocket, and caught sight of the restaurant ahead as I crossed the midway point of the darkened block. I glanced back quickly and saw the guy was only 2-3 yards behind me. I picked up my pace and luckily as I did, an older couple came out of the apts on my right, walking between me and the man.

I sent a text to my boyfriend, asking him to meet me at the restaurant, explaining that I was being followed. I stop at the light before the restaurant, the older couple goes down the side street, creeper stays behind me. I try not to run across the street, into the parking lot, into the restaurant, leaving the man behind...or so I thought. I stand there waiting for the hostess for a minute, then hear the door behind me open. I don't look back, only smile at the hostess as she grabs menus, and says, ""Table for two?"" 

Dread in the pit of my stomach, I nervously laugh and say no just one, but my BOYFRIEND is coming, catching a look at the man in the light. He looks fairly normal if just a tad drunk and looks away when I catch his eye as I walk to my table. The hostess was chatty and sweet, and apologizes for assuming about my bf, since the guy was standing so close to me. I whisper that he followed me as I take the menu...and we both look up to see the man being seated at a table to the left of mine just on the otherside of a shortwall. Instead of having him tossed out, I told the hostess to keep an eyeout and that my bf was meeting me. She chatted with her manager and the wait staff, just in case the guy got weird.

Thankfully, things never progressed aside from him looking over a little too long, until he saw my bf who was twice his size and resembled a nerdy Viking. The man slumped in his seat, a bit sad faced, we drank beer and went home without a hitch. Needless to say the rest of the quarter, I didn't walk home alone."	t5_2t3t8	True
1371057467.0	1g7gq5	A short scare.	GlassChild	132	15	13	"When I was in high school the bus would let me off at the worst possible place ever. At the bottom of a hill, right off of a very busy skeevy main road. I was about sixteen, and clearly female with long blond hair, and often I'd get harassed on this road, so after the bus dropped me off, I'd start my trek up the big lame hill and out of sight onto a dirt road that led to my house. 

Often I had to turn down rides from strangers in trucks, creepy strangers who weren't often overly persistent, just creepy. But that wan't the worst of it. One day I was headed up the enormous hill, making certain to pay attention to the cars. It was ALWAYS bad news when a driver passed looking at you, and doubled back. I noticed a man with curly hair in a tan car doing this on this day, and, since he didn't stop, I continued my walk. 

So the road I walked on was paved up the entire hill, and it was even paved up MORE HILL that went into the forest, branching off from the main road. It only became gravel after about 10 feet of incline into the forest. This part of the road was out of sight and solitary. Well, As I continued into the forest I'd lost sight of curly, and started thinking instead about how badly I had to pee. I was at the gravel by the time I heard the noise. I swear that car was so quiet, he must have driven so slow behind me. He was at the very top, still on pavement, in his car, and the moment I looked behind me, he stood on the gas. He was trying to kill me. 

Being a forest child really saved me. Instead of remaining on the gravel road, I exploded off into the thorns and trees where he couldn't follow, cutting the bend of the road and crashing straight through the woods to my house. Somehow, for the first time ever my key was the first thing my hand touched in my bag. I busted in the door, hyperventilating, and freaking out. My mom was home, and I told her immediately, but she didn't seem to give a single fuck. I guess she thought I was exaggerating despite the fact that I was bleeding from thrashing through all of the thorns. I never saw him again but I always stood like a meerkat at the top of that hill after each walk home, making certain I wasn't being followed.

Edit: Can't spell meerkat."	t5_2t3t8	True

My sister and I (I'm a guy btw) were out tossing the football, riding scooters, shooting baskets in front of our house. Now, we live in a nice neighborhood, by that I mean it's the last place a 9 and 10 year-old would feel unsafe. Except for that night. As we were playing a silver car drove up to us and some old guy poked his head out the window, he looked nice enough and we thought nothing of it, until we had the following conversation: 

Creep: ""Hey kids, I need your help.""

My older sister: ""What is it?""

Creep: ""This is gonna sound crazy but could you help me look for my friends kid? She went out with out telling him and now we can't find her. She's about your age so just hop in and we can look for her!""

At this point my sister and I are looking at each other and freaking the fuck out, we throw our football at his car say ""SORRY NO BYE"" and run inside as fast as we can. We told our mom, who got mad that we were outside with out permission but then said we made the right choice for getting the hell outta there. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1369141191.0	1ererj	Uninvited Party Guest	ellaheather	143	29	12	"This is no where near as bad as some things i have read on this sub but it kind of chilled me at the time and has made me feel a lot less safe in the city at night. It happened to me last year. I was 22 (f) and had recently moved down to Sydney from a more rural coastal town for work.

One night my boyfriend at the time and I were heading into the city for a friends party in a fairly dodgy inner city suburb. We weren't really sure of the address so we were walking from the train station kind of aimlessly. This was probably at about 8 or 9 at night and in winter so it was pretty dark and the streets were deserted as it was a residential area.

We reached the street the house was on but it was long and not well lit with those adjoined terrace houses so it was a bit confusing. We walked past this young woman, she didn't look much older than me. She was just standing alone on the foot pawan staring blankly. I couldn't help myself and as we walked past I asked her if she was ok thinking she might be lost or something.

She muttered something like 'far from it' in a monotone voice then kind of lurched towards me. I was stunned but my boyfriend grabbed my arm and pulled me away and started walking briskly. The woman kept walking towards us but slowly, keeping pace with us. As we quickened she did too, she was literally behind my shoulder, I could feel her brushing against me but she didn't say anything at all.

At this point I realised she didn't have all her faculties and was a bit irked by her silently glued to my side. My boyfriend wasn't a big guy and not great in a confrontation so I was not at all confident that if she turned violent or unpredictable he'd be able to do anything so we ended up pretty much jogging up and down the street looking for the house occasionally crossing the road/moving in between parked cars.

We eventually found the party and there were some guys outside smoking so the door was open and my bf basically pushed me straight inside. However the guys outside assumed the woman was with us, as she was basically arm in arm with me and let her in too. Once we realised we kind of yelled out ""No no, don't let her in"" and a couple of guys took her outside. They asked her if she needed help but she just said ""I'll just wait here for my friend"".

She sat down on the steps by the front door silently for a good hour after we closed the door. She eventually left because she wasn't anywhere in sight when we left the party (and we walked quick smart back to the station!). 

I'm sure she wasn't an actual physical threat but her appearance was well unnerving and the fact that she said absolutely nothing and followed us through all our dodging and weaving, practically touching my hair was quite creepy. I felt stupid for being naive but in all honestly I would probably still try to help someone in that situation again. Probably not when I'm alone though!"	t5_2t3t8	True
1366962215.0	1d54mt	Two is Better than One	MinusSide	142	24	33	"I'll make the back story short this time. I had a good friend named Connor who started dating a girl named Joceline when he was a senior. I was a freshman at the time. She seemed normal enough, but within two months she started acting.. well, like me. She adopted how I dressed, things I would say, and even started preying on the guys that I was interested in (while she was still dating Connor). My friend Connor didn't care. I figure he just wanted her around for a piece of ass after awhile.


One night while Jake (a guy I was pursuing) and I were over at Connor's house, she loses her shit. After she sees Jake and I kiss, she runs to Connor's room and proceeds to beat the walls with her fists. Jake and I are pretty spooked by her behavior. Our friend Shaun told us that she kept saying, ""Magdalene will never be mine, now."" I asked Connor about it the following day and he basically tells me everything Joceline has told him about me. It amounted to a lot of sexual fantasies. He told me that the other night pretty much shattered her world. He then tells me that if I want to do all of her fantasies (some including him), that he'd like that. At that moment, I decided I was going to cut them both out of my life.


Within a week of talking to neither of them, I start getting text messages. Now these messages are weird as shit. I don't respond to any of them, but they keep flooding in. They go from, ""Hi, how are you?"" to ""I need help. I need you to help me. Here's my address..."" and the location would be in the middle of nowhere. At first, I figure it's just some stranger. Until I tell a friend about it, and she scrolls through her phone and confirms that it's Joceline's number. I had never given my number to Joceline or Connor (he didn't have a phone at the time, anyway.)


Then she goes to Facebook messages. She sent me about 200 messages on Facebook all together. I ignore all of them. She then starts contacting everyone I know and asking about me. They pretty much tell her that it's a lost cause and to stop trying to get a hold of me. For the next eight months.. this is no joke - she keeps tabs on me through a mutual friend. She occasionally sends a Facebook message during these months about something I was dealing with. Now I say it was all the mutual friend telling her this, but then there would be times where the details were just so eerily correct that I just wanted to nope.jpg out of there. There were things that I wouldn't even tell this mutual friend. I deleted my Facebook after that, changed my number, and went into seclusion. I didn't hear about her again until a year later. She was telling a friend of mine that I was a ""frigid ice queen"" and that he should be weary of me. Real nice. 


Two years later - Connor joins in on the fun. I get out of class one day, and Connor is sitting in his truck in the parking lot. He gets out of his truck and calls me over. It's been two years, I figure he might've changed. Connor says he'll take me home since he told my ride that he would. Instant ""... fuck me"" moment. I get in the car and while he's driving to my house, he's acting really nervous. Keeps choking on his words, eyes are darting back and forth, and he looks like he's sweating. We make small talk. When we get to my house, I rocket inside. 


I don't know how he got my number either, but he starts texting me as well. He tells me about how much he loves me and that he knows that I love him too, and I'm the sweetest person he knows. I'm a little frightened at this point. It's been two damn years. He hadn't even seen me during that time! I ignore all the text messages. Since I won't answer my phone, he starts coming to my house. The first time, my brother answers and tells him I'm not home. The second time, he says I'm at work (he found out where I worked actually and asked my managers for my work schedule - they barred him from the premises). The third time, he tells him that I'm not interested and to go away. My brother decides to stop answering the door after that. He would come and knock on the door once or twice and leave. The last time, he knocked on our door for 15 minutes before he finally left. 


I had deleted my facebook, but decided to make a throw away account so I could send him a message. It was the meanest thing I've ever written in my life. I meant every word. He stopped after that."	t5_2t3t8	True
1351718013.0	12f5ep	Creepy hotel guests, hot water, and stuffed animals	ChimiHoffa	137	19	19	"I submitted this a year ago to AskReddit long before I knew this subreddit existed. It was just one of those experiences you never forget.

I was working at a Holiday Inn in Omaha, Nebraska back in my college days. Normally I was a bellman, but sometimes I worked the desk. One day an odd-looking guy comes up to the font desk. He's wearing clothes straight out of the 1970's (like a super creepy version of Dan from The Good Guys). Aviators, greasy hair with a massively receding hairline, and a mustache. He has a cane and walks with a pretty severe limp. He asks me where he can get paramedic patches. He says he was called into town on special assignment to help out with paramedic duties, but they make him provide his own patches. This all seemed pretty damn odd to me, so I told him I didn't know where he could buy them, and he eventually left.

Later, I got a call to a room to check out the hot water. There was a report that the hot water wasn't working--it was coming out cold. I went to the room, knocked on the door, and an old lady in a nightgown answered the door. I introduced myself, but she didn't respond. She just stood there motionless. Her mouth was agape the whole time, the way you'd imagine a lobotomized person to look. I saw a motionless pair of legs lying on the bed, but I didn't look around the corner to check it out. I went into the bathroom, turned on the water, and it was instantly extremely hot. The old lady never said a word, and I told her that the hot water was working just fine, and I quickly left the room.

Later, the creepy man from before arrives back up at the desk complaining that he'd called about the hot water not working in his room. Naturally I connected the dots, and an ""oh god not this"" mindset set in. I followed him back to his room at an extremely slow pace--he was very dependent on his cane.

When we got to the room, the old lady was standing there, still agape in her nightgown, not saying a word. This time, I could see that the pair of legs on the bed were attached to an old man, now sitting. The old man sat there motionless, also agape and not saying a word, just looking at me.

I explained to the creepy man that I'd already been there, and that the hot water was working just fine. The weird part was that he didn't care at all about the water. He got out a duffel bag.

From the duffel bag, he pulled a stuffed Bugs Bunny doll. He held it out at arm's length and offered it to me. I reached out for it, not knowing why, and he pulled it back in a ""Mine! Don't touch it!"" kind of manner. He held it out to me again, as if he were offering it to me. I reluctantly reached out to grab it, and once again he pulled it back.

The old man and woman kept staring at us, not saying a word, but smiling with their mouths open and making ""laughing"" sounds (that's the best I can describe them) the entire time this is all happening.

He then took a Donald Duck doll out of this bag. He held it out to me. I didn't reach for it. He kept holding it out. Kept holding it out. So I reached for it. He immediately pulled it away with the same ""You can't have that!"" reaction.

I backed out of the door, told them to have a good stay, and never saw them again.

TL;DR - Hotel people are creepy as hell, and sometimes they offer you stuffed animals."	t5_2t3t8	True
1351292973.0	125dqr	The car in the alley	RainingSilently	133	14	27	"This will require some explanation.  Several years ago I started a project that I have been writing on ever since: I went around interviewing professional criminals to ask them what they did for a living, why they did it, and how they felt about it along with a battery of other questions.  Being young and ambitious I plowed onward with little heed to potential risk about what I was doing.  During that time I brushed with gang bangers, hit men, extortionists, and numerous other unsavory character but one memory in particular still gives me chills.

I was at a point in my work where I was interviewing women and men involved in the sex trade.  It started with independent prostitutes and expanded to include escort agencies and pimps.  I was looking around for my first pimp to interview when I was hit up by a prostitute I had already spoken to.  The girl was an Aussie living in the US, a petite blonde girl who happened to be crazy as fuck but willing to talk.  She said that a friend of hers, a dominican girl, had a pimp that said he wouldn't mind being interviewed.

One of the most important skills I learned during those days was discretion and screening people before I talked to them.  Ironically this skill was taught to me by independent escorts who had to do that kind of screening to avoid cops or clients.  I asked her about the guy in a round about way and got a rough description: a big forceful black guy who strong armed most of the women under his employ around as well as several potential competitors.  She went on to explain that she often had to feed her dominican friend because her pimp would take all of her money and wouldn't hand over a dime even though she was starving.  Asking around on the grapevine of women in the profession that I had come to trust a picture soon emerged of an abusive and dangerous man who beat on other pimps as well as his women.  However he was a fellow known for his vanity, and an interview with me was something he felt that he was entitled to given his self-importance.  With some trepidation I went to this meeting, but on a tip from my friend I timed my arrival during a period when his associated muscle would be out around town and busy with other things.  

I started off the night without any particular worries: I'm a pretty big man myself, a former athlete and lifelong martial artist.  I had lived rough before and had few qualms about getting physical if I needed to.  As silly as this attitude is knowing that you're walking into situations where people have guns and aren't afraid to use them, the way you carry yourself around those kinds of people seems to deter guns being pulled.

I drove into town, spoke with Kelly at an apartment she was staying at, then made my way over to the apartment that this pimp was at.  As I made my way there I felt like eyes were boring into my back.  I didn't look directly, as eye contact in the ghetto can lead to a stare down, which leads to all kinds of crazy shit, but I checked a passing reflection.  Across the street was a car parked in an alley just sitting there.  I knew without looking that there was someone inside, and this feeling of being watched had a kind of malevolence that put me on edge even after everything I had already seen and dealt with.  I brushed it aside as some boogieman or other I had yet to interviewed and made my way inside and upstairs.

The apartment was the kind of temporary shelter common amongst traveling pimps and hustlers on the go: cheap enough to be in the ghetto so as to keep the criminal out of scrutiny, but big enough to be cozy and house anything from prostitutes to hired muscle to stashes of contraband.  I was greeted with surprising warmth by the big man who's employees were all out working that night.  He had dressed for the occasion, not just with strong cologne and a blocky suit but also with a cheap smile and half-remembered manners from some long forgotten upbringing.

He made his best attempt to be charming and I humored him, complimenting his attire and business savvy and inviting him to monologue to his heart's content in response to each question.  He went on about a number of topics, from his status in ""The Game"" to how much money he made, to how fine his hos were, and finally to how he was muscling in on some other rackets to diversify his business.  I should have payed more attention to that last one.

My questions answered and I thanked him for his time, though only after we enjoyed a few laughs and a bit of wine.  I'm pretty good at charming even people I despise.  I made my way out of the building richer my first conversation with a pimp and a good bit of information I was still processing.  As I rounded the corner I felt it again: the death glare from the car still in the alley across the street.  I pushed it out of my mind and just kept walking.

***********************************************

It was about a day or two later that we figured he must be dead.  I got the call from the Aussie girl that her friend was sleeping over at her place terrified.  When she had come back from working that night the apartment had been broken into and from outstide she could hear it being ransacked.  She fled back to the hotel room she had serviced her Johns in and waited to be contacted.  After a time she went back by and found that place broken into, completely ransacked, and without trace of her pimp.

When I got that call I went numb, because everything came together: the talk of how this guy was ""muscling into"" other rackets, the car parked across the street casing the place, and the careful timing of waiting until all of this guy's backup was out of the picture.  I had proceeded the killers in the alley's by only a narrow margin, and it was only due to luck that I hadn't come into the place in the middle of a murder.

This guy was not the only pimp I interviewed, and he certainly wasn't representative of all of his compatriots, but he sticks out in my mind to this day."	t5_2t3t8	True
1345966673.0	yuge5	Walmart Creeper	fallen4him	150	32	38	"This happened to me earlier this year, it was around midnight and I was shopping around Walmart. I casually walked to the register to pay, and I was the 3rd person in line. The first person had a full cart and after the cashier finished ringing them up, the cashier had to change the cash drawer like they do every time it's midnight. So I'm just standing there behind my cart when a man in his late 20s early 30s gets in line behind me. He slowly creeps closer and closer to me and soon enough his body is touching mine and I get really nervous and I have an idea to get gum which meant i had to take a few steps out of line. so I pretend to look at the gum and I look at my cart and the man has his hands on my cart. 

I politely say "" excuse me, can you move?"" and he moves back a little bit. but it wasn't enough for me to get behind my cart, so I just stand next to my cart because he was violating my personal space. 

He starts to talk to me but I ignore him and act like I don't know he's speaking to me. He taps my shoulder then says ""I like your hair"" and I awkwardly say ""thanks...?"" Now the cashier who is a female is just watching us talk while she's ringing me up. And then the guy asks me ""do you like guys with green eyes?"" I didn't hear him so i said ""What?"" and he repeats his question ""Do you like guys with green eyes?"" as he takes off his cap and winks at me. I did not answer his question but instead gave him a look of LEAVE ME ALONE and I turned back around to look at the cashier and she can see that I'm feeling uneasy.

The guy then talks about me and him and about going out. All I could say was ""OK, whatever.""

I pay for my things and as I""m walking out the door the guy yells at me ""BYE! I MISS YOU ALREADY! MAYBE ILL SEE YOU SOON, AT A FANCY RESTAURANT OR SOMETHING!"" and he has a creepy face, it freaked me out so much my heart started racing even more and once I'm out of his sight I run like hell, because I know he will be out soon because he only had 3 things, I get to my car and throw my things in my vehicle, and hide in my car for a little bit because I did not want him to see me or my vehicle.

It was summer and I decided that I would go see a movie. I didn't have anyone to go with so I went alone. I get to the movie theater, pay for my ticket, and walk to the theater. Looking back I don't remember the movie but it's not important. Anyways I walk into the theater before the previews start and find it completely empty except for one guy. He is sitting fairly close to the screen and off to the left. I take my seat right in the center. As I sit down I remembered seeing the guy turn back and look at me a few times. I only saw it from my peripherals, but it seemed fairly normal.

The lights in the theater go down and the previews start. Half way through the second preview the guy stands up and starts walking out of the theater. Except he doesn't. He stops at the row right in front of mine and walks down it taking a seat directly in front of me. This would have been weird enough, but then I started to hear whimpering. I could hear and see him crying. Then out of no where he jerks his whole body around and just starts absolutely sobbing. I mean bawling. He starts grabbing my knee and saying ""I""M SORRY! OH GOD I""M SO SORRY!"" 

At this point I am tweaking balls and all I can think to say is ""It's ok."" But he just kept right on crying and apologizing. Finally I figured the man had some serious mental issues and needed to get out of there. I mustered up the courage to stand up, but he was clutching onto me still. I literally had to pry his fingers open so that he would let go of my pants leg. I guess it is worth mentioning that his hands were soaking wet from wiping away tears and snot. When I finally got him off he just kinda fell to the ground and kept crying. I sprinted to the ticket box and found a manager. I told him what happened and he just looked at me like I was crazy. Finally I convinced him to go check it. 

About ten minutes latter he walked out with the man. He was still crying hysterically and when he saw me he just started apologizing again. The manager came back and offered to let me see another move for free but I just wanted to go home. The thing that really still messes with me 7 years latter is the image of this middle-aged-man looking right into my eyes as he went through something very traumatic. I never saw him again thankfully. In the end, I kind of just want to know what he was so sorry about."	t5_2t3t8	True

I can't remember the dogs name but from what I remember in pictures, the dog kind of looked like a friendly sheep. It was all shaggy haired and poofy but it was clearly a dog.

One time when my grandma was out for a walk with her dog, she stopped to sit down on a bench and take a rest, she ended up dozing off and woke up to her dog growling violently. My grandma told me she never saw a dog THAT pissed off.

My grandma looked over in the direction of where her dog was barking and there was this man who was walking towards her with a rope in hand and was twisting it around in his hands. He noticed my grandma was awake and asked her ""Does that dog bite?"" with a grin on his face.

My grandma looked that bastard dead in the eye and said ""You bet your ass he does!"" and what happened after that I can't remember what she told me, but I believe the guy walked off slowly looking back at her every now and again until he was out of view.

She told me that she was thankful she had that dog, because she felt very threatened and felt like she was going to die that day. 

I'm so thankful she got that dog as well, or else my mother wouldn't have been born, nor would my two aunts and eventually myself and my little sister.

Edit; I was looking on facebook for pictures of the dog and managed to find one. My mom commented on it mentioning how it was also at the time of some murders via strangling, even more yikes.

I met a girl, Helena, who lived with my friend at a small party/gettogether. She was a small girl, maybe 160 or so, very skinny and with very blonde hair and pale skin - almost transparent on both counts. She seemed sad at the time, so I asked her if she was alright and we talked for a bit, at first inside with the others and then outside, just the two of us. She WAS sad, her mom had died the year before, and her older sister had killed herself 8 months before. Her dad hadn't been able to cope with it, so now she was alone with her little sister, as he'd left - her sister was in a boarding school though. She was putting on a brave face though.

 After that night we became friends - I have a protective streak, and this little sad girl seemed like she needed someone to talk to and hang out with, and she was pretty cool apart from the obvious tragedy of her situation. So we'd watch movies together, play games, etc - she was pretty geeky. At one point we started making out, but I was just out of a relationship, and I made it clear to her that I wasn't interested in a girlfriend at the moment, but that I liked her as a friend and that we could do a FwB sort of thing, if that was alright with her. She said that it was, so we start being FwB, obviously a big mistake on my part. There is some drama - she is jealous on occasion, and at one point tells me that she took some pills in a suicide attempt, so I have to call an ambulance (which she tries to run from, and later lied about what pills she'd taken). 

Anyway, we carry on like that for a bit - I still like her when she's not having her episodes, and the sex is phenomenal, but I'm getting the feeling that she's way, way more attached to me than she lets on, and I tell her that we can't continue what we're doing, but that I'll still be her friend if that is what she wants, after some time apart. Worst 'breakup' ever. She starts crying (prepared for that), tries to force herself on me (not prepared for that) and tries to block me from leaving. She's a small girl, and I have 20 kg on her, but I don't want to hurt her, and she's crying like a baby the whole time. I felt so bad for her. She even follows me into the street, her friend basicall had to restrain her physically and drag her back to their house. 

Anyway, that's when the stalking started. At first I tried to help her - she was a pretty damaged girl, and like I said, pretty cool for most of the time. But it's pretty clear that she has major issues when it comes to me, and I soon have to put a stop to it - phone calls 24/7, she would show up at my door when I explicitly asked her not to, would threaten suicide, would not leave, etc. Basically put the responsibility of her own well-being in my hands, so to speak, and trying to pressure me into having sex with her, kissing her, etc. 

I was reluctant to call the cops, because I didn't want her to have a record, and she wasn't threatening me or being violent, but it was taking a pretty big toll on me after a few weeks of non-stop harassment, and so I called them one night, after my threatening to do so didn't deter her (it had on a few other occasions). Turns out, cops do not take you particularly seriously when you tell them that there's a tiny little girl outside your door - I was asked to just remove her physically (thanks cops, just tell me to assault a woman, how nice). One night I was drinking with my buddy when she came to HIS place in an effort to talk him into getting me to talk to her (at this point I've just ignored). My buddy (who used to live with her, and in fact introduced us) had moved to the same dorm as me by this time, albeit in a different block. Of course she freaks out when I'm there, and it takes an hour or so for us to get her to leave. We drink on, but then get this - by the time I go home to my own room, she's there, just sitting in my room in the fucking dark, greeting me with a ""Where have you been?!"". This at 4 am, I am drunk off my ass and can't be bothered to have a conversation with her, so I just go to sleep with her there - she's never threatened me in any way, so I don't fear for my (physical) well-being. The next morning I try and talk to her, to get her to see a psychiatrist or check herself in. She agrees, but tells me that she wants to call her dad first, I say alright, and give her some space - I go outside my room to let her talk. I can hear her try and talk to her dad (who rejects her again again). I go to get some tea (my nerves are pretty wrecked by this point), and when I get back I can't hear her talking, so I go in

 She's in my bathroom, trying to cut herself with my razors - they're safety razors, but she's somehow pryed them open so she can cut herself. There's blood everywhere in my sink and on her hands, and I immediately wrestle them from her and call the cops. She tries to run away again, but I hold her there, and then they bring her to the psychiatric hospital. I come with her, being a stupid fucking nice guy again. We have to wait for the entire day - she doesn't want to be admitted, but her (2nd at least) suicide attempt and her family's history means that she waits for the psychiatrist to come and check her out. In the meantime we talk, and I tell her that if she gets treatment I'll start talking to her again, provided that she can learn how to behave - I really do feel for her, in spite of how batshit crazy she is. She calms down. But then the doctor finally comes (in DK where I live, only people with medical can have the authority to keep someone in the psychiatric hospital against their will, and no psychiatrists were on duty at the psych hospital, only psychologists and similar staff). But the guy isn't even a psychiatrist, just some young doctor fresh out of medical school, who just asks her if she's going to try again, and then takes her on her word when she says no, against the council of the other staff present. I get pissed at her after that, like I've never been before, and outside the psych ward I tell her how fucked up her behaviour is, and that she can't be my friend in any way shape or form until she gets the help she needs. I somehow got through to her, and she agrees to go there, finally. 

And she did get help, but once she got out again (after a few weeks) she started her usual bullshit up again, and I had to call the police after she threatened to throw herself into traffic. This time though, I didn't come with her to the psych ward, since it seemed that she had only gone in an attempt to manipulate me, and she was trying to do the same thing again. 

After that, I get a program to block all her phone calls and texts (I cannot recommend this enough - ignoring messages is one thing, but it still stressed me out). She starts accusing me of abusing her back when we had been sleeping together, and at one point shows up with some of her friends outside my door. I was pretty freaked out then, as I know that at least one of her friends has gang connections, and her other friend is threatening me with her own connections. Our mutual friends also stop talking to her at this point - she is starting to transfer some of her erratic behaviour to them, and they won't stand for it, as they've really tried to help her all they could. I got stress/panic attacks at this point, and I'm taking a break this semester from uni to deal with that. It's been 6 months now without her contacting me, but I still get freaked out if I see someone who looks like her, afraid that she'll start over again. I'm probably one of the only people in the world who get anxiety attacks when I see small blondes in public, but there you have it. That's my story, sorry for the walls of text."	t5_2t3t8	True
1357870751.0	16cr3t	I was a really stupid 12 year old	12yroldidiot	147	32	17	"Using a throwaway since this is a story I don't like sharing IRL and my friends know my account. 

When I was 12, my mom was busy shopping and my younger sister and I pestered her so much, she let us wander around the mall on our own for an hour. We went to a bookstore and I noticed 2 guys, clearly tourists, who were trying to talk to the cashier and having problems with the language. I speak English fluently so I came up and help translated for them. Then I went off to browse.

They came up to me and thanked me for my help. Then offered to take me for dinner as a thank you. Even though I thought I was really grown up then, something felt off. I told them I needed to go home. They asked me where I live. I told them my parents were really private people. They insisted we should grab coffee *now*. By now, I realized that they're standing on either side of the bookshelves and I'm trapped in between them with my sister. 

My younger sister was smarter than me and she ducked under their arms and ran for it. I was just frozen there stammering out excuses and they were moving closer and closer. Soon they were just inches away from me and I was sandwiched between them. I guess my sister got the shop assistant and she came over and asked what's going on and the two guys immediately moved away. I ran out with my sister immediately.

Now this is where I was totally stupid. I should have looked for my mom ASAP, but it was 20 min before we were supposed to meet so I didn't know where she was. I had a cell phone, but I forgot to bring it (my mom's absolute worst pet peeve) and I had lied and told my mom I had it. I was scared of my mom yelling at me, so I convinced my sister we should just walk around a bit more. Besides, they were clearly foreigners so I thought maybe it was just a case of foreigners being foreign.

That's when we realized the 2 guys were following us. At first we thought we were just being paranoid, so we deliberately went inside a lingerie store to see if it was a coincidence. After all, most men usually don't go into lingerie stores unless they absolutely have to. They went right inside too, went straight for me, told me it must mean something we kept ""bumping"" into each other and we should really hang out. I guess their behaviour came off as a bit off to the shop assistants as well (guys don't walk in so purposely into a lingerie store most of the time) and they surrounded them and politely asked if they could help them.

My sister and I ran for it this time. We went straight to my mom's friend's jewelry store, since they always had scary-looking security guards, and the one who worked there on weekends were always nice to us. I told him what happened and he was really pissed. At first I got scared and thought he was angry at us. He wasn't, obviously. The guy was so nice. He called up mall security, stayed right by our side the entire time and even offered us nicotine gum (he tried looking for candy in his pockets and only found that).

Mall security came, and the only description we could give was, ""Big, white dudes.""

Of course, I got yelled at by my mom for not bringing my cell phone and talking to strangers. My dad asked me what I was wearing when he found out about this (um, jeans and a sleeveless shirt? Are arms too provocative?). My aunt who lived in Switzerland and New York yelled at them for that. I love her.

They didn't find the guys, but I did hear that the mall security guards were extra racist and began harassing all white guys who came (sorry to all white guys out there).  

I remember I was scared shitless but thought it was my fault or I was over-reacting for the longest time. It's only when I got older, I realized that was completely inappropriate. By the way, I wasn't a mature-looking 12 year old who could have been mistaken for someone pass the age of consent. I didn't even have boobs then (or now, come to think of it). I'm also one of those Asians who tend to look a bit younger than my age. When I was 19, I got told I looked 15."	t5_2t3t8	True
1349802200.0	117cgk	Need some water? 	hypnotally	138	21	7	"So a number of years back when  I was still in high school (maybe 5 years ago), my best friend at the time and I wanted to get healthier. We had been best friends since we were in middle school together (grades 7-9) and as a result, we lived really close to each other. 

Our plan was to start jogging near her house, which happens to be a relatively new and 'hip' neighbourhood with fancy stores and coffeeshops. Anyways, we figured we'd start off jogging in the early evenings since it was summer and insanely hot when the sun was up. 

This particular night was our first night attempting to jog together. We met up at her place in our gym clothes, did some quick stretches and headed off down the street at the same pace. It's a nice and quiet neighbourhood so we didn't encounter anyone on the street as we worked up a sweat. 

Now, considering we were JUST starting, we were pretty out of shape and completely didn't have the foresight to bring water (or money) and we were at least 10 blocks from her house. My friend in a stroke of genius and decides that we could make a quick pit stop at this corner store down the street. She knew the owner from church and knew he'd let us have some water for free. 

So, we jog over there and sure enough he welcomes her in with this big smile on his face. She small talks with him a bit in Korean (her native tongue) and he gestures for us to come further into the store. He gives us a bottle of water to share, which I promptly chug down. The whole time, he doesn't take his eyes off my friend. She's smiling politely and answering his numerous questions. He says something to her and then leaves to the back room of the store. 

Out of earshot, my friend looks at me and says ""he wants to show us his dog that he picked up last week, it's in the back"". Now, my friend is generally the naive trusting type, but even I can sense the hesitation in her voice. ""He's a family friend, so I don't want to offend him...."" she says. 

So we head to the back and it's this tiny little room filled to the brim with stock. There's no dog to be found. He comes out of a little door and says in Korean that the puppy is actually just upstairs (where  he lives, I believe) and if we would just follow him up, he'd let us play with it for a while. 

At this point, my friend and I share a glance. She says something in Korean, all the while nudging me in the ribs to get out of the room. We are backing out and he is coming closer, speaking in Korean, giving us this creepy smile, and gesturing towards the stairs. 

We get out to the main store area and he's still coming at us slowly, smiling. Forever smiling with that look as if he knew something we didn't. My friend the whole time is speaking in Korean with this polite tone. She's trying to sound light and laughs periodically, but I can hear the panic when her laugh breaks. I'm too afraid to turn my back and go through the door, so we stand in front of it ... still smiling and nodding politely. 

He starts trying to offer us food and candy from his counter, all the while STILL coming towards us. At this point, I'm panicked. Full fledged panicked. I turn around, push open the door, grab my friend's arm and yank her out with me. Once outside, she gives me a look of shock, but neither of us say anything as we promptly bolt up the street at breakneck speeds. I remember feeling the rush of adrenaline giving me so much more energy than I had only 10 minutes ago. 

We get back to her house and she tells me that the whole time he was talking, he kept asking us to go upstairs with him. He wouldn't let up on that. He at first offered the puppy, then said we could take a nap upstairs, then asked if we wanted to eat some dinner with him. She was saying how she didn't know what to do because he was someone from church, someone that was always very friendly and in good terms with her parents. She was scared, but she was now scared of the repercussions - what if he called her parents and told them how she had stolen water from his store or that she had been rude to him? 

Thankfully, nothing came of it. He never approached her or her parents again in church and we try to avoid the topic as much as possible. To be honest, I didn't quite realize how creepy it was until I stumbled upon this subreddit and recalled the entire night."	t5_2t3t8	True
1339532341.0	uyir9	Let's not be FB friends.	dizzymcdizzerson	155	38	26	"I worked at an airport and to get the highest security clearance I had to submit a passport photo. Off to Walmart I went to get a cheap passport photo, in uniform, on my break. The ""photographer"" was a dude, about the same age as me and was very chatty while taking my photo. Asked where I worked, what I did, if I liked it, etc. I didn't ask him anything... so the conversation was pretty one sided.  When it was time to pay for the photo he started asking me questions while typing stuff into the cash register/computer.  Thinking that he had to ask these questions (because it seems like you can't buy anything these days without giving your phone # or postal code) to put into Walmart's system, I answered. He asked my name, phone #, and email address.  Then I paid for my photo and left.  The next day I had a friend request on Facebook. I didn't know the name, but when I looked at the picture it was the ""photographer"".  He didn't send a message like ""I hope this is ok but I thought you were cute"" or anything like that... just his friend request was there.  I felt violated!!! I gave that info to him because I thought it was required for my passport photo... not so he could add me as friend on Facebook.  I declined his request and he persisted to try 2 more times.  I still declined and avoided that Walmart for a while.   After his last request, I started looking at his profile page and skipped down through his friends list. Turns out he had 3 profiles of himself, all with different variations of his name and was friends with himself. Seriously. 
One of his alter egos was making a movie. Ew."	t5_2t3t8	True

1328397912.0	pb6bp	Running Away From [My] House.		145	27	20	"While reading a couple of stories here, I was hesitating whether or not I should tell my story because I don't think it'll be in the right category.

Well, please excuse any grammar mistakes for English is not my first language. Here goes, a little bit of background first.

All my life I've lived with an abusive father, a VERY nice mother (she passed away almost three years ago) and an annoying brother. 
He would get furiously angry and violent whenever we'd do... who the fuck knows what. Things we would consider nothing bad, he would.

One time I wanted to put on deodorant, but it was almost all out. I decided to get the little pieces and rub them against my armpit.
I sat down on my dad's computer and left, and when he came home he started screaming ""Who did this to my chair!?"" The little deodorant pieces fell on his chair. I had no idea they were going to fall off (I was 11 at the time... yes I matured quickly.)
I got hit, of course. 

One time we were going to the barber shop. My mom always crosses her legs when she sits. 
It was summer so she wore shorts, and with her legs being crossed and two guys sitting in front of her ""staring,"" dad got extremely jealous.
He told her ""You did that on purpose, you whore. You sat with your legs crossed so those two men would be staring at you!""

It was ridiculous.

It was bad. He'd sometimes be so mad at us, he wouldn't talk to us and would throw the plate full of food my mother had served him, to the floor. ""I don't want to eat your damn food.""

I'd sometimes stay stuck in my room for three days (yep, he holds anger that long for something small and stupid) fearing he'd hit me if he'd see me outside.

I hope you get the idea on how my dad is. He's also very big and strong... the more reason to fear him.
I'd tell my mom numerous times to divorce him... but she said she wouldn't.
My childhood is a blur because of so many horrible memories... he's even molested me.
I wouldn't tell my mom because we're already poor enough and didn't want us to be in financial trouble. I didn't want my family to be apart.

Jumping to the present, we lost our house and lived in a family friend's garage, whose two daughters I've known since childhood.
My mom passed away on the 15th of February two years ago, and without part of her income, we couldn't afford to keep paying for the house.

My brother (21) started to do bad things, like going out at night, drinking.
He came home drunk one night and my dad got mad, mocking him while my brother was vomiting.

He kicked him out, took him off the insurance, and wasn't able to afford education anymore (pity, my brother is extremely academically smart).
It was just dad and me now. My  brother ran away to my uncle's house. 
Dad forbid him to bring anything with him, but he did when dad was out working.

It was just dad and me for a long time... scary things happening, me having to sleep with our ""front door neighbors"" various times.
I tried to be strong, I tried to cope with him.
I thought ""If mom did it, so can I.""
People would always tell me, even my brother, if dad starts to get too abusive... to just, run away. Run.

I even started to have weird dreams... of my dad molesting me while I was sleeping. I don't want to know if those were real.
He'd sometimes wake me up getting REALLY close to my face, which made me extremely uncomfortable.. he'd always get a little too close to me.

And now for the actual story.

I'm in my college's orchestra, so we sometimes get free stuff.
Each of us got two tickets to go to see Lord of the Rings in concert.
I thought, since I already went with dad to see Journey/Foreigner/Night Ranger, I'll invite my best friend (who LOVES LotR).

I asked dad if he could take me. he got pissed and started telling me how I treat him as a chauffeur (not true, he rarely gives me rides, I barely go out. I always take the bus.)

""Ok, if it bothers you so much, I'll take the bus."" There is a bus stop like 3 minutes away from my house that drops me off at my college (which is near where the LotR concert was gonna be).

He said no, I'll give you a ride.

The concert was absolutely amazing. My friend and I had a blast.

But for some reason my dad always loves to be a dick and ruin my most fun days (like graduation, he admitted he didn't care that I graduated... him not even finishing middle school. He dropped out. One of the worst nights ever.)

But this night was *the* worst.

I called dad.
""Hey dad, can you come pick me up please?""
""Who do you think I am, a chauffeur?""
""Ok... I could always ask my friend for a ride.""
""No, I'll give you a ride.""
Me, not knowing much about street rules, I saw these cars parked in front of me and he said ""No, I can't park there!""
""Why not?""
""Shut up, I just can't. Stop asking so many damn questions and meet me in front of the restaurant.""
""There's way too much traffic. Why not on the side of the center?""

He hung up. Fear started to dwell upon me because I knew what was coming. Another fun night ruined and going to get beaten.

A lot of time has passed and I started to wonder where my dad is (he hasn't called me).
Turns out he was parked 20 feet away for quite a while.

I got in the car, started bitching at me for NO REASON at ALL.
""I'm tired of your damn attitude, I'm gonna take you off my insurance and I am going to kick you out immediately. Just like your brother, and you're going to be kicked out with absolutely nothing on you. You're tiring me you little fucking bitch.""

I was frightened all the ride home.
We got home, our front door neighbors were asleep.

He kept bitching to me about the same thing.
""And turn off those god damn fucking lights!""

He would come in my room and turn them off.
He would always do that, even when I haven't had a chance to put everything away and dress up in my pajamas. I'd have to use my cell phone for light.

He said ""You can fucking get out of the house, for all I care. Go ahead and just fucking leave.""

I thought for a moment, and suddenly I was thinking of something I've never dared actually doing (well once, but I really didn't want to.)
To run away from home.

Quickly, I packed up the most important things: school books, laptop and notebooks.

He said ""Where are you going? Are you going to our neighbors to cause more pity?""
I said ""No, I'm leaving.""

I ran all the way to the main street. 
Now... this was at midnight, in a neighborhood full of homeless people and drunkards. 

I ran behind a Jack in a Box. I knocked and cried but they wouldn't let me in.
I called my boyfriend to come pick me up immediately. I didn't have time to explain.
I saw my dad coming, and I ran across the street, ignoring the streelights (thank goodness there were no cars out at all).

There was a fight going on by the gas station. I was full of dread and other intense mixed emotions I honestly wouldn't care if I got killed.
I ran across to the street next to it.

There are a couple of bars there, some drunk teenagers and a couple of bums.
I hid between the bushes on the Starbucks drive thru, squatting for 40 minutes.
I'd stand up a few times to stretch but I really didn't want to in fear of my dad spotting me.

I was afraid the drunks and bums were going to do something to me.
Thanks goodness they did not. One of them just asked if I had any money. I mean, I'm a woman and women are more prone to being harassed. And even though I'm 18, I look really young, like a 14 year old. 

I saw my dad's car pass a couple of times on the streets... I was very glad there was a building next to Starbucks so I was not visible to him on the streets.
I was very scared that he might go through the drive thru, though.

I keep texting my boyfriend ""Please, please hurry."" ""I'm no longer at Jack in the Box, I'm at Starbucks now.""
(We live very far from each other, like 30 minutes away.)
but it took him longer.

Finally, he texted me ""Ok, I'm here behind Jack in the Box.""
""Shit,"" I thought ""I don't want to go back there again. What if I get seen!?""

I just stood up and ran like a motherfucker diagonally across the street.
I couldn't find my boyfriend but turns out he brought his dad's car.
I quickly got inside, and told him to drive away.

I was still shaken by the whole experience. I still get chills when I think about it. This all happened three months ago and I haven't returned home.
I am currently trying to start over with my life."	t5_2t3t8	True
1356582451.0	15i436	Just find the dog...	thenightbattles	143	26	39	"I have to go backwards before this story happened. I was raped a few days before Christmas and I did not have a supportive home life at the time. To be concise, my parents had no interest in helping me and despite being 17, I had to go about picking up the pieces by myself. And it did not go well.

Toward the end of winter, a friend invited me over to her home for a sleepover. We were both 'goths' and I was feeling pretty good that day so I decided that it would be nice to have fun like a normal girl for once. She lived on the other side of town and she always had to pick me up from the bus station because I have a terrible sense of direction and I would get lost. We also made big plans to go to the larger city because it had store that sold 'goth' stuff and we wanted to go shopping.

We got back to her house and set up for the night: Sleeping bags, junk food, pop and my bag. My friend suggested that we rent some movies and we could easily walk to the video store by her house. I put my cell in my bag and we set off. Got to the video store and found our favourite: low budget 80's slasher films and they were only available on VHS but we were prepared and had set it up.

Walked back and began to cut through the playground of a school because it was dark and the streetlights offered poor light. 

Standing on the basketball courts was a man, standing by himself. Ever since the rape, I was constantly afraid of strangers, the dark and my own shadow so I immediately took this man as a threat.

He asked if we could help find his dog, it had run away. My friend began to answer but I cut her off and said we had to go home. He began walking toward us, begging for us to help find this dog and I was pulling my friend's coat to make her start walking. Something felt very wrong about the situation.

He realized we were not going to stop and he was about 1m away from us and pulled a crowbar that I suppose he had slipped into the waistband of his pants and held it like a bat. I froze, and she froze.

He said ""Don't move. I won't hurt you.""

With his other hand, he undid his pants, pulled everything down and began masturbating and awkwardly shuffling toward us, pants around the ankles. When he got closer to the light, I saw he had a bandana wrapped around his mouth and nose.

My friend and I turned and ran and he began screaming that if we just held still and stopped moving, he wouldn't hurt us. I grabbed my cellphone and called the police and began hysterically telling the operator that we needed police and when she asked where we were I started and stopped because I really didn't know where we were.

I looked for my friend and she had gone a different way than I had and the man was advancing on her and this is what went through my head at the time:

I knew what he was going to do and I resigned myself to that fate but a horrible thought occurred. My friend was a virgin and had never had a boyfriend. I made the decision that I would convince him to rape me instead of her. It had already happened to me and I was already used garbage, filth. But he would not touch her.

I began running at him, screaming as loudly as I could. In hindsight, I'm not sure what the plan was, but my screaming got his attention an he began advancing toward me. My friend took advantage that his back was turned and she threw one of the VHS boxes at him.

I grabbed her arm and ran. He was still screaming for us to stop, that he wouldn't hurt us.

We stumbled into a convenience store and began crying and begging the owner to call the police. I had dropped my phone in the process. He called the police and also made us tea. It's funny that it's been such a long time and I can remember the tea in the styrofoam cup.

The police came in droves. They separated us and gave me a female officer because I looked the worse out of the two of us. I sat in the back of the car and tried to calm down to tell her what happened. I remember being very surprised that there was no room in the back of the car and I spilled the tea, but I told her what I remembered and began crying when I realized that I could offer nothing. Didn't see his face clearly, only that he was white and male. The officer was very nice and was very patient with me, despite the fact that I was probably making little sense, apologizing constantly for not stopping the man and crying.

They drove us home and explained that this guy was a repeat offender they were trying to catch, he had recently done the same thing to a small girl but was scared off.

We got home and my friend began to cry hysterically and I sat there in sort of a numb haze. We agreed that we'd both still go to the city and 'make the best of things'. We tried to have a good time, but it was false and after awhile I began to get scared of every man I saw. For some reason, I decided that the best course of action was to chop off my hair and dye it black. I wanted to be invisible, I didn't want anyone to look at me and it seemed that black was better than the natural blonde I had.

In hindsight it sounds so silly, but at the time it sort of wrecked me. I was 17 and even more afraid of the dark than I had been before. I was a jangled mass of nerves and I used to have nightmares. And I did tell my parents about what happened. They weren't interested because ""nothing had happened to me"", but were very angry that I dyed my hair. Thankfully, my friend's mother was very supportive of my friend and took very good care of her.

The nightmares have almost gone 100% away. Thank you for reading my story, I apologize for any poor grammar or spelling."	t5_2t3t8	True
1350758384.0	11t2yy	My creepy roommate [UPDATE]	resmiranda	148	36	19	"Original story [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/11ojdg/my_creepy_roommate/)

I completely moved out of the room yesterday into my new dorm, and my roommates here are really awesome so far. My roommate has been going to counseling. As for having to pay the money for the new dorm, I haven't heard anything from my parents yet. I think they dont want to worry me about it.  My father was on the phone for an hour with DPS, the RD, and the Housing Director about this issue, and that man knows how to get what he wants. I know from past events that he is not afraid to take legal action. 

I returned back to the dorm when she wasn't there to start putting my things into boxes. I got an email from my RD assigning me to another room, but I had to give my new roommates 24 hours before I could move in. The roommate came in and again when I was almost done packing and gave me a dirty look and sat down against a wall. She started to interrogate me. My room is shaped like one of those sideways z blocks, so I was emptying my closet out of her line of sight while she was sitting on the floor on the adjacent wall. I was trying not to keep my back to her side of the room. I heard her mumbling and thought she was talking to her family on her computer via skype since she had it in her lap. Then she started to speak louder in an angry tone. Keep in mind that this conversation was very fast paced, happening within a few minutes while I was trying to figure out what I needed most for another night away from this suffocating room.

""Did housing ask you to leave?"" 
""I just think that we both need our space now.""

""Why are you being so cold now to me? You weren't like this before, you don't like me anymore do you? It's because of what happened last night isn't it?""

In my head I'm thinking, ""OF COURSE IT WAS BECAUSE OF LAST NIGHT!!"", but I said, ""I just don't deal well with stressful situations and my courseload doesn't help."" 

""Can you tell me what I did to be a bad roommate so I don't make the same mistakes again with the next girl? What happened last night scared you off didn't it?""
Of course I'm not going to tell her all that bothered me because she was already using an angry tone with me and I didnt want to set her off. 

""I don't think that really matters anymore."" 

""It is because of last night right? I need you to answer the question right now because I feel like everyone is leaving me and I need to know why.""

At first I was a little sympathetic to what she said, but she said it so forcefully that the thought completely disappeared. 

""Look, I went through some really hard times last semester too, so I understand that you need your space to sort things out. This campus is so small that we barely get to be alone to think about things. I'm trying to give you that time."" 

""What did you go through last semester?"", she said in a patronizing tone.

""I had some major family issues that took me out of school.""

""What kind of 'major family issues'?"" She was mocking me at this point. 

""Ones that I don't care to discuss with you or with anyone. Now if you'll excuse me...""
I grabbed as much shit as I could carry and got out of there as fast as I could. 

One of my friends said she saw my roommate sobbing uncontrollably in the school cafeteria during dinner.

I came back the next day with some friends to help me move out of there. I explained to them the situation and told them not to be in the room by themselves just in case. All I had left to move were a few heavy boxes. When we were almost done my roommate came in, but she was in a better mood.  I hope the counseling center was able to help her overcome this.

1348166241.0	107e1q	Lured into the basement at 3 AM	tkmac69	166	49	31	"I finally remembered this story that happened to our mom in my house maybe five years ago. I'll do my what I can, but she tells it best.

It was about 3 AM. Everybody in the family is home (my brothers, my sister, me, and my dogs). We are all sound asleep; except for my mother. She's startled by the barking of my dog, Trevor. Trevor is old as shit and generally an asshole, so we almost always disregard his barking; but sometimes you just *know*. 

She leaves the bedroom in her pajamas. The entire house is pitch black. As she descends the staircase, step by step, she can hear a faint buzzing; sort of like a vibrating phone. This is weird. 

Trevor sees her in the kitchen and gets that alert look on his face, like he was trying to say, ""I want to tell you something."" 

Anyway, my mom checks every door. All locked. Every window. All closed. She can still hear the buzzing and follows the noise to the basement door. She is half asleep and sees nothing wrong with going into the isolated basement to find a weird noise, and all while alone.

Keep in mind my basement is very large and totally unfinished. There is a cold, concrete floor, cracked stone walls, and a few hanging lightbulbs with dangling pull chains. You have to walk up to them to turn them on if you want any light. There's no light switch down there.

So my basement is pitch black, save for the three window wells that carry the moonlight in through the dirty, barred windows. As my mom climbs down the creaky wooden steps, the buzzing is becoming much louder. She enters the basement and it is very prevalent that the sound is coming from my dad's workshop, which is hidden in a little cranny on the other side of the stairs.

She doesn't have a flashlight.

She steps nervously on the cold stone ground and follows the moonlight around the corner. This leads her into the workshop, which is especially dark. 

There's the sound. 

My dad's sander is plugged in, turned on, and buzzing violently on his desk. My dad unplugs all of his tools when he is done with them, to save energy; and he surely would have noticed if he left it on. 

My mom calmly turns it off, when suddenly it hits her.

""Somebody turned this on so they could lure me down here.""

She sprinted through the basement, back up the stairs, and locked the door behind her.

It never happened again, and we never found out how the sander turned on.



**TL;DR:** My mom believes she was lured into the basement by a stranger playing with my dad's power tools.

NOTE: I am coming home this weekend and will upload pics of my basement for reference if y'all want it.

NEW NOTE: I went home. Forgot to take pictures. Was too busy to go on Reddit. Sorry folks :/

1328388206.0	pazsp	[My] My Stalker, Batman	fluffyplague	129	12	27	"In the late 1990s, I was living in South Texas, in my mid-twenties and engaged to be married. I went to Cosmetology school to get a certificate as a nail technician, attending classes at a local beauty school for a 2-month-or-so long course. At the time that I began classes, I was the only Anglo there -- aside from me and a black woman, everyone else was Hispanic.

Including Batman.

Even though he denied it. (If he had a name other than Batman, I never knew it.) Batman was crazy, schizophrenic, and believed that he was Bruce Wayne, also known as -- you guessed it -- Batman.

I was never sure why exactly Batman was there, but he was a fixture of sorts at the school. He was in his early 30s, obviously, deeply, *scarily* mentally unbalanced, and desperate for female attention. The teachers and administrator took complete advantage of Batman's problems and personality, and used him as a sort of ""gofer"" when they wanted something. I once saw him run at a dead sprint at the height of a Texas summer to the Dairy Queen four blocks away, just to get the admin a Blizzard. He hung around all day long, creeping all over everyone...and I became his favorite target.

For as long as I was there, the teachers would tease Batman about his ""crush"" on me...""He *really* likes white girls,"" they would sneer, giggling. Batman began to stop creeping so much on other students, and would stand by my table and entertain me with the intricacies of his delusions. He may have been schizophrenic -- in any case, he heard voices. The loudest voice belonged to ""the Colonel,"" and apparently talked non-stop about killing people. He told me in great detail about how he was really Bruce Wayne and his ""stupid Mexican parents"" were just fakes, secret agents, who were working against him...I really wanted to bring up that the fictional Batman's parents were dead, but I didn't want to show interest in any of his shit for fear I might wake up with him skinning me some night.

As I got closer to graduating, Batman got scarier. My fiancee used to pick me up after class was over, and Batman became very hostile but never made a move or said anything to him -- mainly because my then-fiancee (now husband) is six foot five and looks like a biker. I got married while attending classes there, and the day before the wedding my fiancee came in and, while he intended to get a crew cut, there was a miscommunication and the girl ended up shaving his head with no guard on the clippers.

The next time I saw Batman, he had shaved his head, too. It was terrifying -- even if it hadn't been creepy because I knew he'd done it after he'd seen my fiancee's hair, it also made him look disturbingly like Bjork's crazed stalker. The one who tried to send her a mail bomb and then shot himself on camera.

The teachers were still less than helpful -- asking them to please keep Batman away from me, because he made me uncomfortable, just made them tell him that I shouldn't have gotten married, and that he needed to step up and make me see how much he loved me. I have to believe that they didn't actually mean me any harm, and didn't really understand just how unbalanced and possibly dangerous Batman could be. They didn't understand that this was probably the worst possible thing they could have said. They just wanted to stand back and giggle while I squirmed under Batman's creepy attentions.

My last day, I was thrilled to be graduating. I'd hated coming to school not just because of Batman -- I was desperate to be free of the ""cool girl's clique in high school"" atmosphere, too. The teachers really leaned on teasing Batman that day -- ""She's leaving! You'll never see her again, Batman! You better do something!"" By the time I was leaving, I was extremely on edge. Batman hung onto me like a tick you just can't get at to remove. He kept offering to take me home, that I didn't need my husband, he'd take care of me, on and on.

The building was shut and locked up for the evening, the teachers and students were all heading out to their cars, and I was stuck waiting for my husband, who had picked today of all days to be late. I came very close to begging one of the more sympathetic teachers to stay, but she left, too. The only nearby phone was inside the building, locked up. (No one had cell phones then.)  I was alone with Batman, standing outside the building. I was scanning the street anxiously while Batman tried to convince, plead, or cajole me into going with him to get his truck. (He lived nearby, I think.) He would give me a ride home, he said, and show me how he felt about me.

I kept insisting that I needed to wait for my husband. Batman got very intense -- he never touched me, but the intensity in his eyes was terrifying. He finally declared that he was going to get his truck, and I'd see. He'd show me. The minute he was out of sight, I ran. I cut through the parking lot to the next set of buildings, ducking down behind a dumpster and keeping an eye on the road and parking lots. I saw his truck come back, cruising slowly through the lot, and then an adjacent one, farther away from me. When I saw his truck move on back to the street, I ran again, heading for the grocery store nearby.

I remember standing in front of the store, buffeted by the waves of people going in and out and the blasts of cold air when the doors opened, shaking and terrified. I hoped that being in a public place would keep me safe. If I saw his truck, I could run inside. My husband would be able to see me, hopefully, when he drove by, and pick me up -- otherwise I had no way of calling him. I was *definitely* not going back to the school.

Eventually, my husband did show up. I got into the car as soon as he pulled up, before he'd even braked properly, tearing open the door and bursting into tears. I never went back to the beauty school, or saw Batman again. I've known mentally unbalanced people before, been in dangerous situations before (I was assaulted as a teenager by a man with a gun, as one example) but I can't ever remember being as afraid for my life as I was standing there, alone, with Batman. I truly believe that if I hadn't run, he would have killed me."	t5_2t3t8	True
1358798420.0	1709jw	The church stalker	slugagainstsalt	129	16	19	"I was a young and naive youth minister working at my first job at a church. I was very eager to know my kids and their parents. I had made a pretty active program and we were attracting new kids everyday. 
One day this single father and a little boy show up. OK, normal story. The dad is a big guy-not fat, just overall big. But just creepy looking. He was missing some teeth, didn't show much, and it flagged my intuition. The little boy is a trouble maker. his first day there, he is already pushing other kids down. He is a bully that has some serious issues. The dad has a sob story that he just left his wife and she was abusive. The little boy starts to show up to youth events, and so does his dad. Normal. 

One day I am sitting in my office, alone, and I hear something in the copy room. I don't think anything of it because we keep our door locked and you have to have a key or be buzzed in to get inside. I assume someone with a key is in, maybe the other minister. After a few minutes, I hear a kids voice, so I step outside into the lobby area. There is the creepy dad and the boy. They are going through the cabinets in the office. I have no idea how they got in here, so I hold my cell phone and stay in the lobby with them. I say that I am about to run some errands and I have to arm the office, so they would have to leave. In reality, I was going to take a trip around the building to get rid of them. It is a ethics policy to not be alone with congregants in the building as a protection for not only the congregants, but the ministerial staff. I was going to do anything to get them to leave. As we leave, they go out one door, I go out the other. I have my phone ready in my hand in the car and the creepy dad starts knocking on my car window. I had an older car without power windows at the time, so I reach over and roll down the window a little bit. He wants to know if I would baby sit his kid someday. He said he left the kid last week and the kid peed all over the apartment, so he was looking for a babysitter that would be a good influence on him. I said that No, I couldn't do that. I had other obligations and had no room to fit that in my schedule. He sat trying to open my door for a few minutes, then trying to push the barely open window down, begging me to babysit before I said that I really had to run an errand at that moment. He finally leaves me and I drive away. I knew he would be there for a while waiting for me to return, so I go get an iced tea and a snack at my favorite fast-food joint. I drive back to the church and he is still there. I call one of the older people that I knew lived close by. He agreed to meet me at the church. By the time we both got there, the creepy dad and kid were gone.

 The next week, I hear them in the office again. I still have no idea how they were getting in the office or what they were looking for. This time he has come to tell me he DVR'd a special about Jesus and he wants to invite me over to talk about it and eat dinner. He said he would even buy wine. I told him no, that is not something I could do. He then invites the youth group to come over to his apartment and watch the Jesus movie. I suggested that we could watch the Jesus movie if it was at the church, but that is all. He got pretty agitated at this point. 

It was about this time I started getting weird text messages. I would get text messages that said ""you look so pretty today"" and ""I like that blue shirt"" almost everyday. Mind you, I wasn't at the church everyday. I started putting things together when one Sunday morning, I was using my cell phone in the front of the church for a children's message when it started to ring. It was that number I had been getting text messages from. I hadn't ever responded to the number, so I just ignored it. He kept calling it and laughing in the back of the church. He later said that it was him who had pranked me in church, so I knew the texts were coming from him, and I knew he was watching me when I wasn't at the church. 
About a month later, the text messages were starting to get a little more perverse. I was getting texts from my ""secert"" admirer and graphic details of our date he had imagined in his head and was planning for us. I had mentioned the texts to my male supervisor a few weeks before, and he suggested I responded that I am not interested. My professor at my seminary, on the other had, said to completely ignore the messages, which i had been doing. 

Well, this pissed off creepy dad. The messages started getting aggressive like ""If you don't reply, you will regret it."" A few weeks later, I was at a summer camp with kids at this point, and a fellow female minister looked at me while I was crying about this and basically said that this guy was a perv, and I needed to get rid of the guy. We had a co-minister who was a male  call the guy and told him to stop, or I would press charges. 

The creepy dad then went and complained about me to the church board, saying I was leading him on and I was the one sending him the perverted and graphic texts. He had imagined that I was flirting with him while at church when I talked to him and his kid, when in reality, it was my job. It was at this point that the senior minister actually listened to me, read the messages that I had been forwarding to the senior minister from the creepy dad, and was shocked about what was going on. My supervisor didn't believe me at first saying that sexual assault doesn't happen in church from a congregant to a minister. It was at this point, whenever I did something in the service like pray or preach, creepy dad would walk at and stare at me from a window outside until my part was done and then creepy dad would return to the santuary. It was at this point that a congregation member who was friends with the lady minister above put things together and that he wasn't just sending me messages, but to 5 other ladies in the church. 

As things turned out, he has been going around to various churches in the area, preying on the single women in the congregation and using his kid as a bait to get sympathy so he could have sex with them. It turned into a huge fiasco because the church didn't want to ask him to leave because it was open to everyone, but we had a predator in the congregation that made many people feel uncomfortable. He ended up having to move because of his job, but I am still creeped out by him this day.

1356754298.0	15lxt1	"""White chocolate is my fave."" The Update"	MidnightOfcourse	154	39	104	"First post: http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/15kdv7/white_chocolate_is_my_fave/

Like I said in my last post, this guy kept calling up until Christmas Eve. I thought perhaps he was done with his obsessive interest in me but we all know that just because we think something is over, doesn't mean it really is. 


Christmas day I was up at 7:30am and ready to get the day rolling. After opening gifts at my own house, I got ready to go to my grandma's. She lives about 10 minutes away in a neighboring town. I had fear of going out (I had stayed inside cooped up since the day he stopped outside my house) but it was Christmas and I wanted to spend time with my family. I was outta the house at 12:30pm and started my short drive. 


I kept looking behind me, scared out of my mind that he would somehow appear out of thin air. He never did appear. I could see two cars behind me most of the way, a red and green car. I spent 2 hours down at my Grandma's without incident. As I was ready to go, we hear the buzzing sound of the motion detector at the end of her drive. We look outside to see who it is and a red car is sitting at the end of the driveway. The lurked on for a few seconds and back down. I breathed a sigh of relief. The red car that pulled in the driveway WAS NOT the same one that was behind me, like I said the ones behind me were there most of the way but not the entire way. Both turned off at different points as I was going through the town. (Thank you to the PMs asking this, I was typing too fast to catch that I didn't clarify)


I was back in my town and at my sister's for the rest of Christmas by three. The drive back was uneventful and I was thankful for that. I was at their house enjoying a great time when my cellphone started ringing. I looked at the number but only PRIVATE appeared on the screen. The number called 5 more times before leaving a voicemail. I went into the bathroom and checked it. This voicemail was crisper than the others I had gotten from him.


""Hey baby. Merry Christmas. I can't wait to f**k you tonight, that's a great present isn't it? Mmm...I thought so too, toots! So I was nervous you would be going somewhere to meet up with some man, but when I checked on you, I noticed you were behaving like a good girl. Such a good grandbaby you are...Mmm good girls deserve to get nice gifts, right babe? I'll see you tonight."" 


I literally started to gag I was so scared. I called the cops on my cellphone, telling them he was planning on 'seeing' me tonight and told them about his past actions. They asked if I had a number, I said no. License plates? No, he was driving a different vehicle. His name? No, he never mentioned it. How does he know you? I don't know! Has he threatened you? Not exactly but he keeps talking about me being with other guys and being sexually explicit. 


After all the questions, again I was told there was nothing that could be done. I begged and begged for them to do something and finally they agreed to drive by my house a couple times that night. Later that night, I was looking out the windows scared out of my mind thinking he would pull up. A cop sped by once or twice but that was it. Some protection, huh?


I didn't see any suspicious cars driving by but I couldn't stop wondering if he was in any of the cars I had seen. It was midnight when I got a text from a number that actually had actual numbers.


12:05am
1********89
""Hey baby. I'm waiting. When are you gonna come out? I wish you wouldn't fight me! Always fighting me, toots! If you keep fighting me, it will be worse on you. Why do we always fight? You won't be dissapointed if you just came to me, yano that right? just come on.""


I called the cops again and gave them the number he sent me. They said they would look into it and get back to me tomorrow. I was told to stay in the house. I never replied to the text and I never even opened my door. The next message was the first one to get violent.


2:26am
1********89
""Why do you have to be a little slut? I told you that I didn't want someone touching on you! F*cking little bitch! Come out, I will make sure you get f*cked properly, nice and hard like you deserve! You can scream f*cking no! I won't give a damn! I will keep going till you f*cking tear! That's what happens when you don't F*CKING listen to me!!!!!!"" 


I didn't know what he was talking about! I don't have a boyfriend so whoever he thought I was with in my house is beyond me. I called the cops AGAIN and told them he was getting more gruesome and threatening. They sent someone out to patrol. I didn't sleep Christmas night needless to say.


The next day, the cops call me and tell me the number is a throwaway. A tracfone. Nothing else. They said to call them if I needed too, I told them I would call them if anything happened. I didn't know who this guy was or how he was stalking me so thoroughly when he knew nothing about me. 


Now it is the 28th of December and I have taken it upon my self to obtain the necessary license and paperwork to own a gun. I told the police that I was doing all of this and they seemed apprehensive. But I will be damned if some guy is going to rape or kill me because I didn't have the right means to protect myself. 


Today, a letter was in my mail box in a white plain envelope. It only said, ""Let's stop fighting, (my name). Love, Darren."" 


I called the police immediately and told them the name. I don't know if it's his real name or not. So as of now, I have a man named Darren making me feel like a caged animal. I only go out if necessary with my mom or my sisters. I don't really have any extra details but I don't know if anything else will happen. I'm not gonna be hopeful but I don't want to assume the worst.

1350283877.0	11i2tu	Secondary school Creeper	sheepinabox	133	17	19	"When I was in secondary school, I had a pretty hard time adjusting to others. I was the socially akward penguin kind of person, the one standing in the corner of the school yard with her equally awkard friends. We all were in different classes, and we all were pretty much the outsiders in our classrooms.

I was very shy back then. The boys in my class used to bully me, since I´d either way wouldn´t talk back or if I did, my replies would be so dumb I´d embarass myself even more. Most of the girls were rather nice to me, though most of them only lower themself and talk to me if they needed the answers to current exercises/homework, since at least I was pretty smart.

The only time I was in a different class was during math lessons. I pretty much suck at maths, thus I was in Class B. The differences between Classes A, B and C was this:

* In Class A were the ""smart"" people. There you´d find the geeks, the ""normalos"" and the posh, who got their grades by copying the geeks´ work.
* In Class B were the more wierd people. The ones walking around in baggy clothes who were constantly caught smoking or taking snuff.
* In Class C were the dumb people. I can´t describe it any different. The roughnecks, the slutty looking kind of girls. The ones who were convinced that 1 + 1 equals 3.

___
Note: This of course was the stereotyped thinking of a teenager. 
___

Although I didn´t get along with *everyone* in my math class, some of them also liked to pick on me, I felt a lot more comfy than my main class. They wouldn´t mock me about my clothes, or for not wearing make-up. (I´m allergic to most of this stuff, so I was pretty bummed about that) They simply didn´t give a fuck.

Amongst my class was a boy, I believe he was two years older than me, who sat in the row in front of me. His name was Stefan. Two weeks after school started, I noticed he often turned his head to look at me. Sometimes randomly while we´d have to do exercises, sometimes when I had to anwer a question.

One day he walked over to our group during lunch break and asked if he could talk to me. He made compliments, saying stuff like I was pretty and charming and what-not. Now, the thing is, I´d already heard some rumours and gossip about him. Turns our many girls had already been approached by him, and the general opinion about him was that of a horny wierdo. 

Our schoolyard was rather small, so it was inevitable to not hear the gossip going around. Even amongst the socially awkward penguins. Nevertheless, I was flattered when he started flirting with me. Until then, boys either way pretty much avoided me in large curves or were being douchebags, and my self-respect wasn´t exactly high. Hearing stuff like ""You´re pretty"" and ""I like you"" made my brain go complete mush. 

One thing led to another, and after one month of awkward conversations we exchanged phone numbers. We used to walk home together (even though I lived about 2 minutes from my school), and he often sent me lovey-dovey messages on Facebook or through SMS. As time passed he began to become rather pushy. His text messages became more frequent and went from ""I love you"" to ""You´re so sexy"" and ended with stuff that was way too inappropriate. I never replied with ""I love you"", I either way wrote stuff like ""That´s so cute of you"" or ""&lt;3/:)"". I became pretty scared of him over time. He began to get more and more pushy, often trying to kiss me and calling me his girlfriend to others - even though I never said or agreed our relation was more than friendship.

The occurence that finally made me flip my shit was when I was at a friend house on a wednesday afternoon. We always had a free afternoon on this day, and I´m the kind of person who always forgets to take the phone with her. When I got back home in the evening and checked if there were any messages on my phone, I freaked out. Stefan tried to call 54 times and sent 72 messages consisting of ""are you there?"", ""why aren´t you answering me?"" and ""PICK UP THE PHONE"" - over and over. 

I didn´t tell anyone about this at first. Next day in school I told him to stop sending me messages or calling me. I had already rejected an offer when he wanted me to come to his house for dinner while his parents were away and was generally creeped out. I wanted him to stop talking to me, stop approaching me - in short, leave me the hell alone.

He agreed, all the while giving me the sad puppy look and repeatedly telling how much he loved me. And allthough he kept his word and stayed away from me, he still sent me stuff on the phone or on my Facebook wall. I didn´t really care though, because I never used my phone a terrible lot lurk on Facebook.

Then, out of the blue, he started following me. My house didn´t lay on his way home. In fact, he had to walk pretty much the opposite direction. I didn´t notice him at first, only feeling the tingly sensation of being watched, which I simply brushed off. There were many other students taking this way. One day I was walking with a friend, who decided to stay over. Halfway home she pokes me and asks, if Stefan had recently moved house(she knew about our ""relationship). To my confused question why she´d think so she answers ""Because he´s been following us the whole way."".

I asked the guys in my math class the other day if Stefan had recently moved to another place. His best friend declined, but I didn´t think more about it. Maybe he visited a friend living near me that day.

A few weeks passed, and he still took the same way as I did. I´d try to walk faster, and he´d adjust his speed, trying to catch up with me. Sometimes he´d ring the door bell, to which I never answered, always waiting for him to give up and leave. Back then we lived in a five story house. My room was on the second floor and the only window pointed towards our garden. We didn´t have a fence or anything, so anyone could walk around our house and look into the living room - sounds absolutly fantastic, right? We never had any cases of theft or break ins though, because we lived near a farm which had this huge dog running around. He wasn´t exactly a guard dog though. He´d bark and yap at every fluff passing by, thus annoying the shit out of everyone at night.

Winter came by, and left our garden in a big pile of mud. I used to look out of the window a lot, because my bed was right underneath it and you had a fantastic sight of the sky. As I watched the stars one night, my parents had already gone to sleep, I heard faint shuffling noises coming from outside. I look down, only to see someone standing in our garden, staring up to my window. The glass door to our garden has a PIR. If you went near it, the lights around the house would go on - they were very bright, enlightening the whole facade.

I don´t think I need to tell you who I saw, standing in the light in our garden. He ran away shortly after the lights went on, but you could clearly see footprints in the snow, which had started to fall shortly after dark. I told my dad about Stefan, showing him some of the text messages he had sent me (not the inappropriate ones, of course). He assured me he´d take care of it, him being your typical over-protective father.

The next night, he hid around the corner in front of the glass door, where one wouldn´t be able to see him while standing under my window. That creeper Stefan actually came back to stare up to me, this time with more distance so he wouldn´t set up the light. I was trying to get to sleep at this moment, when I heard my father yelling. I looked out the window and saw him grabbing Stefan by the collar of his jacket.

 Now, my dad is about two metres tall, sturdy and he looks rather unpleasant to deal with when he´s pissed off, while Stefan was about 1.50m. Dad lifted him up until his feet dangled over the ground, yelling at him to leave his daughter the fuck alone, and if he´d ever catch him again on this property, he´d shove his fist straight up his ass.

Needless to say, he never showed up by our house again. He stopped texting me and avoided me like the devil - he even moved his place in class as far away from me as possible. 

I´ve recently added him on facebook - it´s been six years, and I figured he´d stopped being a creeper by now. I´never really held conversations with him but by what I´ve seen on his wall, he has a girlfriend now.

TL;DR: Creepy guy starts showing up underneath my window at night, gets table flipped at by awesome dad.

Also: I´m sorry for any grammar mistakes. English isn´t my native language and I get to use it rather sparely."	t5_2t3t8	True
1346923246.0	zfxqf	Timmy	cincharge	151	34	47	"Alright Redditors, after finding a salty mix of solace and horror, I have decided to submit my own gigantic slice of ""yikes!""

This story takes place over about 3 weeks during a summer in the early 90s. I was almost 9 years old and about to go into the 4th grade. My parents, needing something to do with me while they were at work, found a day camp that took place in a park within walking distance of my house and signed me up without hesitation. I put on my best neon t-shirt and went off without protest.

Living as close as I did, I was about 15-20 minutes early for the first day of camp. Fortunately, the counselors were waiting to receive me. The only name I recall was Stacy, a 16 year old girl who sported a heavily teased, blonde hairstyle, humidity be damned. After getting all checked in, I was introduced to the only other kid there, Timmy. On the surface Timmy was actually pretty adorable; he was tiny with auburn hair (I know, I know...a ginger, but we didn't know back then), big brown eyes, and dimples for miles. He was seated at a picnic table and lit up when he saw another kid had arrived. He introduced himself and divulged that he was about to go into the second grade at the same Catholic K-8 school I attended. I remember being confused about that as I had never seen him. Each grade had 15-30 kids so everyone knew most everyone else, but I reasoned that since he was younger we never shared a floor and thus, never met. We chatted briefly, but as a young girl about to enter into this pre-middle school phase of my life I was willing to be polite, but not looking to befriend what I saw as a ""baby."" Soon other kids began to arrive and I drifted off with girls my age.

As that first week went on, I was enjoying time with the friends I had made, but Timmy was not having the same luck. He was always sunny in disposition and very polite which made him popular with the counselors, but not the rough and tumble boys his age. Unfortunately this led him to tag along with me, the first person around his age I guess he felt he had connected with. 

For the first week and a half, I was nice to him, letting him come along when we went to the ""big kid"" swings, etc. But it wasn't long before he began telling me that he thought I was beautiful and that we were boyfriend and girlfriend. That was more than I could bear; he was cramping my totally awesome style as it was, and if the girls I hung out with caught wind of this it was OVER. I took him to the tire swing and in the nicest way possible told him that I thought he was really sweet, but that I needed to hang out with people my own age. I could see he was sad, but he shrugged and sighed, ""Ohhhkaaayyyy,"" in agreement.

We had weekends off from day camp, so I was home on that Saturday in between the 2nd and 3rd weeks when the phone rang.

""Hello?""

""Hi Cece!""

""Who is this?""

""It's Timmy! I missed being away from you soooo much so I called to tell you that I love you and can't wait to see you on Monday!""


I know that it all sounds fairly benign and perhaps even sweet in our adulthood, but in that moment my stomach flip flopped because this just felt wrong.


""Timmy? How did you get my phone number?""

""Miss Stacy had it in her papers.""


That's right; little dude jacked my phone number from the counselor's roster. 

I told him that I had to go and ended up having to hang up on him because he wouldn't end the call without me saying that I loved him.

I tried to get out of going to day camp on Monday, but my parents weren't having it. Once there I avoided all eye contact with Timmy and told my friends what had happened so we relocated if he even came near us. Unfortunately due to the small size of the park, we couldn't avoid him all day and he caught up to me eventually.

""Why are you being so mean?""

""I'm sorry, Timmy. I don't want to be friends with you.""


He sighed sorrowfully. What he said next and how he said it will stay with me forever.


""You must think I'm a fucking asshole.""


Now, he said this with quite a bit of sadness in his voice, but for a girl who is not quite 9 who attends a Catholic school, the words themselves hit me like a ton of bricks. I immediately ran to tell the counselors, with Timmy running close behind. As soon as he saw them, he mustered up some fake sobs. I whispered what had been said into Stacy's ear, and she looked at me with complete shock, although not in the way I expected.

""Cece! Timmy would NOT say that. Did you say something bad, Timmy?""


His eyes got ""Disney wide"" as though he were the most innocent creature in the forest.


""Never ever, Miss Stacy!""

""You see? Don't make things up, Cece. No one likes a liar.""


To this day, I still feel some of the injustice that I felt in that moment. Not being believed when you are telling the truth, particularly when you feel like you might be in some danger, is the absolute worst.

With that, she scooped up the fake crying Timmy in her arms with her back to me. As she soothed him, he dropped the act and stared straight through me. No longer a sunny little guy, his face was cold and unfeeling.

The next day at day camp, he was suddenly the counselors' favorite (I can only assume Stacy told all of them what a horrible little girl I had been to him so they took him under their wing) so he spent his day giggling and playing with them. I breathed a sigh of relief thinking it was all over.

He found an opportunity with me towards the end of the day when most kids had already left. I was alone at the tire swing and he approached me with the coldness I had seen the day before. I was a little scared, but I was miffed about the lie from the day before.

""Timmy, why did you lie to Stacy about the bad words you said?""


He ignored my question, replying:


""You're not going to get away from me. If I want to have you, I'm going to have you.""


With that, I stood up and ran past him in the direction of my house. I didn't care about the counselors calling after me. I didn't care that I wasn't allowed to be home by myself. I was going home and I was staying there.

My parents were bewildered by the tantrums I threw to get out of day camp, but could see that something was seriously wrong and left well enough alone. There was no fee for the camp, so they didn't lose out, and even though it was out of the way, I got dropped off with an aunt for the rest of the summer.

I was afraid he would call again, but he never did. Pretty soon, I shoved the incidents into the back of my mind and everything returned to normal. That is, until school started again...

About the second or third day in I was walking down the hall at the end of the school day. I passed by what I thought was a third grade classroom getting their things together to go home for the day when I spotted him. He was standing away from the class in the middle of the hallway, smiling a huge, frightening grin in delight at the sight of me. I stopped dead, spun on my heels and ran to the nearest girls' bathroom where I locked myself in a stall. A nun yelled at me, but it has never been more worth it.

And I never saw him again. What's even stranger is that he never appeared in any yearbook from that year or any year before or after. It's as if he came to school that one day and left when I wasn't happy to see him.

Sorry for the long read, but that's my tale of WHOA.

I never understood why and always chalked it up to growing up without a steady Dad. Until my mom shared 2 stories with me. I was 5 at the time, and due to a poor childhood I just don't remember anything from that time or earlier.

The first one was short and sweet. We were walking down the street, my sister and I holding my mom's hands as we went. A man approached going in the other direction, which is pretty typical. As he passed us by, he bent down, grabbed me under my shoulders, and started walking away. No word, no sign. Just grabbed me. My mom still had a hold of my hand and she ripped me from him and ran straight to the police.

A while later, after we had moved to a new town, I guess this guy started talking to me. He drove a red truck, and would stop on the side of the street and just chat with me. I don't remember, but I guess I told my mom about this guy after a while and she told me to stay away. So I wouldn't talk to him, but he still followed me. So my mom had me stay closer to home, and made sure that someone walked me to school each day, and eventually we just moved away. Pretty sure he ended up getting arrested, but as I have no memory of this I couldn't say

And finally, the one I do remember. I was a teenager. This guy who looked just like Marilyn Manson (randomly) would always be on my same bus. I thought nothing of it. But then he would stay on a stop later each time. Until finally he stayed on until after my stop. The next time I took the bus and he was on it, he talked to me. He said he has a studio in his basement and would like to record me singing. I got off the bus and never took it again"	t5_2t3t8	True
1375164851.0	1jc02z	Stay Away From Pete	InnocentLove	151	34	19	"When I was 15, I met this very charming, sweet-talking 18-year old named Pete. I had mutual friends with Pete and we met at a party. We instantly hit it off, despite me being a sophomore in high school and he was a freshmen in college. That should have been the first red flag.

Pete and I were only dating for a few weeks before he started pressuring me into having sex. If I told him ""no"" he would get angry. He would tell me that he could find another girl and I was lucky to have him. I believed him and let him talk me into it. He would make me feel guilty if I told him I wasn't in the mood. What Pete wanted, Pete got. 

A few months later, I noticed that he started getting more controlling. He would call and text me throughout the day. I'm not talking just a text or call here and there. He would literally text me every 10-20 minutes and call me frequently. One time I had to stay late after school to make up a test. The test took maybe 25 minutes or so. When I was leaving, I noticed that I had 7 missed calls and voicemails, and 16 texts. I called him and apologized, telling him I had to stay after school. When I got to my car, he was waiting there. He flipped out on me and accused me of cheating on him. I apologized again and promised to always let him know where I was. He also told me that I needed to stop dressing so ""slutty."" I was wearing jeans and a tee shirt. 

Over time, he pretty much alienated me from my friends. He wanted me to spend all my free time with him. If I did spend time with friends, he was there. If there were guys around, I wasn't allowed to talk to them. Even if a guy talked to me first, I would just make up some excuse as to why I had to leave. A little over a year into our relationship was the first time he hit me. We were arguing about him wanting me to move in with him (I told him I was only 16 and not ready). He was yelling at me that I didn't really love him and that I was sleeping with other guys behind his back. He said that if I didn't move in with him, he'd break up with me. I said ""Fine."" Well, it wasn't fine. We started physically fighting, and I left.

I broke up with him for a few days before he convinced me to get back together with him. Things were good for a while (physically better, he was still emotionally abusive and controlling--I realize that now). Shortly after I turned 17 I moved in with him. My parents were furious, but I was ""in love."" When I moved in with him, things only got worse. He would force me to have sex whenever, with the premise that he paid rent and I should be appreciative of that. I'm not saying I didn't want to have sex, but he wanted it whenever, wherever. A lot of days I wouldn't even go to school. He had already dropped out of college. It got to the point that he was physically abusive  more often than not.

About 10 months after moving in with him, I remember looking in the mirror and thinking ""What am I doing?"" I was covered in bruises. At this point, I had recently (somehow) graduated high school. He wouldn't let me get a job. So, I spent all day everyday at home. I wasn't allowed to leave the house when he wasn't home, like I was a child (plus I had no means of transportation). I hadn't talked to my parents in months (thanks to him). I had a cell phone that he checked daily, and was only allowed to talk to him. It was terrible and yet I was too scared to leave. 

That night, we were having dinner and everything was going well. He had had a good day at work and seemed to he in a good mood. I can't remember what exactly it was that got him angry but I remember him snapping. I remember it all being good and the next instant we were fighting. He grabbed me and was screaming at me. I had never stood up for myself, just always taken it. For whatever reason, in that moment, I thought ""Maybe if I stand up for myself, he'll leave me alone."" Wrong. I punched him in the face and he looked at me shocked. His nose was bleeding. He looked like he was about to walk away. Then, he grabbed me by the hair and started beating the shit out of me. 

I ended up in the hospital with a broken nose, two black eyes, a concussion, my entire face was bruised, a broken wrist, amongst many other bruises. He dropped me in front of the hospital once he realized the extent of my injuries. He told me to tell them that I was mugged. Are you kidding me?! He left me there. I told them the truth and he was arrested. I moved back home with my parents. I stayed with them for a year before moving cross country.

I haven't seen or spoken to Pete in 7-8 years. The last I heard, he was working some shitty job and with some new girl (he's 29, she's 20). I guess he thinks that if they're younger, they won't stand up for themselves. Well, I did. "	t5_2t3t8	True

I had just gotten in a fight with my best friend about something stupid and decided to walk it off. It was around 12 am and I was just walking around my subdivision listening to music chain smoking. After about 3-4 laps around, my street makes a circle around more streets so you can walk around in circles, I noticed that there was a white van driving around. It had passes me a few times.
Around 130 I got a phone call from my friend I was fighting with, and I stopped on a corner and sat to talk it out. After a few minutes of sitting I noticed the van was parked a few cars away but the engine was still running, I told my friend about the van and he said to start walking home. 
Bad news, the quick way to my house I would have to walk right past the van, the other way was about a mile and a half to get to my house. I was a little freaked. My friend told me to dial 911 just incase and he would be there in a few minutes. So I started to walk the long way home and the van started to creep up behind me...
Noticing that my friend's girlfriend's house was about 5 houses away I ran. Luckily she was awake and my knocking didn't wake her parents. As she opened the door and walked out the van sped off. 
About 2 days later I was watching the news and in another subdivision in my town a girl about a year younger than me was abducted and raped by a man in a white van. I think about that a lot. And never walk alone at night anymore."	t5_2t3t8	True
1367025925.0	1d6xhx	"""I need my tools."""	sashathebrit	133	18	15	"I was a summer camp counselor in NYS the summer I turned 18. It was there that I realized I couldn't stand kids, mostly because of this encounter.

I was in charge of the girls aged 11-14. They were...difficult, at the best of times, but one girl in particular was impossible to deal with. She was twelve and very quiet, withdrawn from the other kids, and never wanted to listen to anyone. One day I took the girls back to the cabin after lunch for quiet time and she asked to go outside. One of the other counselors volunteered to go out with her and anyone else who wanted to go because she knew I needed a nap, so they went and I caught some z's.

I was awoken about fifteen minutes later by the counselor who was frantic. Katie wasn't to be found. Could I help her look? I sent two campers to the office to tell the director that there needed to be a lost camper alert, and we went to find Katie.  Our cabin was right at the edge of the woods that covered a rather sizable hill and I hiked the hell out of that thing, yelling for Katie, threatening, pleading, etc. I eventually found her sitting on a rock, and in her hand was the biggest goddamn knife I have ever seen.  I calmly asked for it and she shook her head. ""I need my tools,"" she said firmly. I sat down next to her, keeping my eye on the knife, and tried to have a conversation with her about her ""tools"". She confided in me that she took this knife from her dad's hunting gear and hid it here during a night hike, and that she planned to hurt the people here she didn't like. It was fucking chilling to listen to her. Her voice was very calm, her expression never changed. I asked her which people she didn't like and she named a few campers, then looked me dead in the eyes and said ""...and you. You're always trying to talk to me. I don't like talking to you. I want you to shut up. I'm going to make you shut up.""

I was almost shitting myself at that point. I don't know how but I managed to grab her wrist that was holding the knife and held it above her head. I yelled for the camp director who was searching the woods with a couple other counselors (as per regulation) and she rushed over and saw me manhandling this kid who was biting the hell out of arm trying to get me to let her go. I still have the scars from those bites - it was like a snake lashing out at someone, she broke skin and my arm was seriously bloody. We called the cops who called the parents and Katie was taken away. The director told me some months later that Katie was in the psych ward after threatening to bomb her school and was never allowed back to our camp. This came with a job offer but I sure as hell wasn't going back."	t5_2t3t8	True
1357878769.0	16d0ol	Trevor?	elfinette	141	30	18	"
When I was in my first year of high school (grade ten) I was in a class called Leadership. We would organize school events, like the Terry Fox Run, or put on fundraisers for charity. Lots of poster making, and we would organize all the dances.

One of the quieter guys in the class was Trevor. Trevor was quiet and never volunteered for anything. His jeans were always filthy and his hair usually unwashed. He was new to the school and usually sat off by himself. I noticed he had a couple nervous twitches and hated to show his teeth when smiling or talking.

I volunteered to make a banner for some school pride thing. Me being in the class was a bit of a joke really, since I am not exactly a great advocate of school spirit. I just needed the credits, but I did like like making posters. The teacher, Ms Frink, decided that Trevor had sat on the sidelines long enough and paired us up to work on the banner. I could have handled it myself, but I knew what Ms Frink's motivations were, so I decided to extend an olive branch of friendship (or at least civility) to Trevor.

I sat next to him that class to sketch out ideas. He was very shy and would hardly make eye contact. I told him that I only live five minutes away from the high school, so if he came over after school we could finish the banner this afternoon. He agreed.

We met outside the school office and walked to my house. I tried to make polite conversation, but he was shut up like a clam. When we got there, we went into the rec room The rec room was in the basement, but my brother was in the same room watching *Serenity*, so I felt safe.

We sat on the floor and colored the banner with big markers. I asked him if he had ever watched Firefly, and he said he hadn't, so I was telling him about it. Suddenly, he grabs me by my shoulders and sticks his tongue in my mouth mid-sentence. Seriously- just stuck his slimy tongue in my mouth, no warning. I pushed him off of me quite quickly, but the damage was done. I told him that I unimpressed with his behavior and told him to get out. He left and I finished the poster alone. My oblivious brother didn't notice a thing.

That night, around 8, I got a phone call. When I picked up the home phone, Trevor's usually quiet voice was confidant and slightly slurred. He told me he loved me and asked me why I didn't love him back. I told him that he was drunk and that I was hanging up now. He stopped me with this gem-

""If you hang up I'll kill myself. I'll kill myself and your dog. I'll shoot your dog.""

""No, Trevor. You are going to crawl into bed and sleep it off. I'll see you in Leadership."" I hung up the phone and went back to washing dishes. I was a dumb fifteen year old.

Around 10, my dog began barking like he would when a stranger would come onto our yard. I immediately got a ""feeling""- just a bad feeling. I put a sweater over my pajamas and went outside. It was Trevor. He actually didn't look drunk at all. His eyes were very intense and focused. The street was dark except for the one street lamp that hadn't burnt out yet. It was chilly and I was not happy he was here.

""Trevor, go home. Seriously!"" That was when he pulled the gun out of his hoodie pocket.  

""Say you love me or I'll shoot myself. I will shoot myself and you."" My mind was racing through every possibility. If I ran, would he shoot? Before I could answer, he said, ""I am going to kill your family.""

Now, kids, I was an idiot. Please, don't do what I did. Run away and call the cops. But when he said that, I pictured my little sister in her bed. Eight years old. Honestly, since my mom worked night shifts and slept during the day, I'd been looking after her since she was a baby. And the thought of this guy hurting her filled me with rage.

I ran at him and tackled him to the ground. I threw all of my 108 pounds into it, and I think he was so surprised he didn't even try to move out of the way. I managed the get the gun out of his hand, threw it as far away as I could, and proceeded to punch him in the face a couple of times. It was after I got a couple blows in that I realizes he was shouting something.

""It's not real! It's not real!!""

I stop. I stare at his face for a moment. I'm breathing hard. He looks like a scared little boy. I get off him and run to grab the gun from out of the street.

It's a lighter. A heavy, metal, very real looking lighter shaped like a handgun. I put it in the waistband of my pajama pants and tell him to get off my yard. He complies and jogs off. I wait for a minute, breathing deep to calm down, before going back inside. When I do, my brother doesn't look up from his computer game. I wrap the ""gun"" in a couple garbage bags and put it in our trash bin. My mom was already at work, so I never had to explain what happened that night.

The next day I went to the police liaison at my high school and told her what happened. She wrote down everything I said and thanked me for telling her. I don't know what ever happened to Trevor, but I never saw him in Leadership again. He switched schools during winter break and then moved to another province when he graduated. I just hope he got some therapy or something.

1351267891.0	124nuq	From weird old dude to potential spree killer in one semester	blackbasset	142	29	20	"Beginning of last semester, I noticed that weird dude in one of my classes. He was a Masters student like the rest of us, but seemed to be between 50 or 60 years old. I first noticed him because the first few sessions of the seminar, he always came late and sat down right in front of the professor, whereas the rest of us was scattered through the back of the room.
 
  Herbert, as he was called, looked and acted kind of strange, always wore some kind of icky sweater, and looked unclean altogether, but I'm not the person to judge others by their look. 
 
  At first, he wasn't that striking, just kinda odd (not the only one at my university, I must say), but after the third session or so, he started to ask random question. The class was about the medieval and modern depiciton of Jesus Christ (I don't know why I was taking that, but the professor was great and she is always able to make things interesting) and Herbert always tried to start some discussion about church, how it inflicts misery on the world, etc. - absolutely unrelated to the class, as the professor pointed out. Herbert also somehow tried to imply with everything he said that he was some kind of great sufferer, akin to Jesus. When he spoke, it kind of sounded as if he had a stroke, as if he had no full control over his mouth and everything he said sounded kind of incoherent. The rest of the class and the professor decided to ignore that behaviour since we did not want to exclude someone from studying just because he isn't up to our ""standards"".
 
  Fast forward a few weeks, Herbert is becoming weirder. He starts to bring plastic bags with him, filled with empty or nearly empty bottles of juice, energy drink, etc. He tends to mix together the bottles remaining contents and drink it in class. Which was, I might add, kind of disgusting to watch. Of course, he is still always late and his questions continue to be weird. One time, he asked another student for her book, because he forgot his own. She's a nice person and thinks he wants to sit next to her and read in it with her, so she agrees. But he takes her book, goes back to his seat, closes it and falls asleep. 
 
  Another friend told me that, in other classes, Herbert often stands up, looks out of the window for a few minutes and then sits back down. Other professors noticed his behaviour, too, and friends in the student council tell me he is a regular visitor in their room, talking about random stuff and refusing to leave.
 
  Next week or so, Herbert had to do a presentation for our Jesus-and-stuff-class like we all had to do, but he didn't show up. Our professor told us that Herbert called her office six times the day before, always asking which topic he should cover. She talked to us about what to do since his behaviour was becoming more than distracting and you could see that she was concerned. Since it didn't look like he would show up at all, the session continued without him. He did show up though, _only_ 80 minutes late (of a 90 minute session). After the professor closed the session, Herbert raises his hand and asks: „Can I now please start my presentation?“ She replied: „Well, you're way too late for that!“ „But you can't do that, I'm from Dortmund!“ (a city that is 30 minutes away from my university)
 
  Once again, fast forward a few weeks. My friends from student council tell me he also phoned them, complaining about rumours that they allegedly spread about him. Next thing, he appears in their room, talking about random stuff and how he went to the firing range the last weeks and mumbling stuff like ""you always meet twice"".
 
  Even more stories surfaced. Apparently, he also threatened other professors and their families after class, often saying things about how they wouldn't want their kids to be hurt and so on... Also, there seems to be a peeper on campus, since someone tried to film female students going to the toilet. Now campus security is patrolling the corridors, especially around the classes Herbert enrolled in. 
 
  Nothing happened after that, apart from occasional warnings by professors and so on. Everyone seems to be relieved he is gone. This semester, everything seems back to normal, at least what's considered normal for a german university..."	t5_2t3t8	True
1342764585.0	wv0m9	Our run-in with the KKK.	tetrisman95	143	26	69	"So, let me start by saying I have no clue if this belongs here, but I do know it's a good story.

So I live in a state where the KKK are still really active, and one of their main ""secret meeting places"" (Just about everyone in town knows where it is, and it's also an effing freaky wood that teens go to to get freaked out) an old battle ground is around 15 minuets from my house. So one day we decide to go to ""Hobbit Land"" (That's what everyone calls the woods as their are legends of evil Hobbits protecting their woods.)

When we get there, we know somethings not right as we can here a bunch of people off in the distance, so Mike kills the lights, and drives the car a bit farther into the woods, that's when we saw a big group of 70-100 people gathered around a big bonfire.

We get freaked out because we know that they don't take kindly to strangers, but as he starts backing the car out the way we came, we hear a woman *screaming*, like, bloody murder screaming. Shit was not alright.

So, Mike, trying to be a *hero* turns on the light, and drives the car right into the opening and yells many profanity's at them, telling them to let the woman go. They didn't like this.

We see a group of about 5 men running into one of the trucks parked there, so Mike steps on the gas and we go flying into the trails in the woods, with them right behind us. 

After about five minuets of driving through the woods, not being able to lose them, Mike gets the an idea... he slams on the breaks, and gets out of the car.

Then, the five men all jump out of the truck, with baseball bats in hand and start walking towards our car while shouting things at us along the lines of ""You're going to regret coming back here."". When they're about 10 feet away from Mike, jumps back into the car, locks the door, and slams on the gas.

We got out of the woods and couldn't see their lights anymore, and headed back into town.

I still freak out about what they would've done if they caught us, and what happened to the woman.

TL;DR Got chased through woods by people my friend yelled at for possibly torturing a woman. Get into town, it's after 2 A.M. so we didn't get any tacos.    

**EDIT** After righting this out, I'm really not sure if it belongs in this sub. But I like the story so I'm going to leave it here for now."	t5_2t3t8	True
1340774192.0	vo6k0	I came so close to being kidnapped.	cl0udaryl	134	18	7	"Although this story is short, it has resonated with me to this very day.  When I was about eleven years old or so, I was out playing with a couple of friends close to my house.  It was a closed off drive so unless you lived there or were visiting, you had no reason to drive in.

So as we were playing what was most likely Dragonball Z, a flashy red sports car with a man we had never seen before drives up along side us.  Without hesitation he asks where a local girl we knew off was called Florence.  I told him her usual hangout spots and that's all I knew, one of the main spots was simply a drive over. 

This is when things began to get weird.  The driver, in his 50's unusually calmly tells me to ""Hop in, and you can show me where she is."" My friend instantly turns to me and gave me a look of worry.  Fortunately, he did.  I was an easy-going kid and had a habit to be naive and that look of worry really urged me to not get in the car.  

After him further prompting me to get into the car and telling me he was Florence's dad, almost as though he was in a hurry, I told him that I would walk to the bottom of the street (which wasn't far) to show him where the drive was.  He agreed and drove slowly along side, even at the end of the road he attempted to convince me to get into the car.  Thankfully, even though I was young, I knew it was impossible for him to not know where to go.  I had pointed directly at the drive in question.

It was a few days later that we found out through a few friends that it was not Florence's dad at all.  Not only did her dad not own a car, but the man's descriptions rung no bells to anyone.

I came so close to ending up in a pretty bad situation.

EDIT: I should also add, I never found out anything about this man.  No one had any idea who he was, nor did we ever see the car or man in the area again.  Florence was about 4 years or so older than me, so thinking back it was unusual to even question us as to where she was, especially when she never hung out in our street.  As to how he knew the name Florence, I will never know."	t5_2t3t8	True
1333665320.0	rvct1	[MY] A Lucky escape.	_Lobo_	138	25	16	"So this incident happened to me a couple of months back.. I was returning from work rather early around 1:40 p.m or somewhere near that time frame to the apartment complex I lived in. It's not the best area in the city even though the police station is just up the street it doesn't stop all the sketchy activity that goes on. As I unlocked the front door to the complex so I could make my way in I headed over to the elevator and pushed the button and awaited till it arrived. As it had arrived I pushed the button for the 4th floor, reaching into my pocket I pulled out my cellphone to check out some recent text messages I had not looked at earlier. As the elevator climbed up to it's destination I could start to hear a lot of screaming and thrashing I pretty much thought it was a bunch of kids screwing around in the damn complex. As I pushed open the elevator door I looked down the hall towards where my apartment was located and my eyes locked onto some madman who was banging on my neighbors door wielding a knife with blood running down is hands and smashed glass from one of the hall windows scattered everywhere. He was yelling aloud about how he wanted his money and it looked like he was trying his hardest to break down the damn door, my first thoughts was ""this guy is clearly on something and want's his damn money"". Now I can't get to my apartment for two reasons. 1) he was in the way and no way of sneaking past and 2.) The apartment complex was set up awkward so the staircase was on the other side. Just then out of all my luck my damn phone began to ring and that's when he turned his head towards my direction and began to yell even louder using every damn swear word I've ever heard of, before I could even mutter a word he began to walk towards me hitting the knife against the wall letting his blood smear all across it I figured I was pretty much fucked at this point.

Opening the elevator door I frantically pushed the 1st floor button and was watching with anticipation as the elevator doors slowly began to close I could now hear him running towards me yelling louder about how he was going to fucking kill me. Just as the doors closed I could hear him banging on the outer door and just screaming as if he was being murdered or something a scream i'll never forget. As the elevator began to descend down it clicked in my head ""What if this fucking psycho is waiting for me downstairs?"" All I could do out of instinct was hit the emergency stop button on the elevator and call the cops. From what the operator had told me was the cops were already called and were standing outside that's all that I pretty much got out of the call I made.. As I sat in the elevator for what seemed like eternity I could finally hear a bunch of noise bellow me I guess I was at the half point of the 2nd and 1st floor.. It was the cops detaining the guy as I worked it up I finally clicked off the switch to let the elevator resume it's descend to it's destination.. Looking out the glass doors I could see    the police walking off with the man in cuffs one of the officers walked up to me and asked me If I saw anything, I told him I got off of the same floor the psycho was before he started to make his way to me apparently I got off lucky as they had also retrieved a gun from the man I was told. Shortly after that incident I moved out the complex to a better part of town but i'll never forget that psycho and all the blood smeared on the walls and the way he was wielding that knife."	t5_2t3t8	True
1332480856.0	r9lrq	I'm back unfortunately		139	28	45	"Hey guys. So I'm back with another damn story about something that happened tonight. It happened again while I was working. So I get pulled off of my register by managers and they take me into a room I've never seen before at work. I think it might have been AP office or so. But they pulled a video up on one of the screens. Of...my...car. Employees have to park out in our own parking area, which is really far away from the store. Ok anyways, there was a dude by my car. I was like ok... And I asked what was going on. Sometimes they play pranks on employees and write on their cars. Well, this guy by my car starts smearing something all over my windows and car. At this point I was staring at the screen with my mouth wide the fuck open. They ask me if I knew the guy. I flat out told them no, even though I couldn't see who it was. In the next few seconds I see the flashing lights of cop cars. They surround my car and the guy just continues smearing something on my car. They wind up tasing him and after he is sedated or whatever, I see an ambulance pull up. This whole time I'm just sitting here, silent tears streaming down my face from absolute horror. He goes away in the ambulance with the cops following. Two of them come into the store, escort me to my car to ""identify it"". Ok the dude fucking smeared BLOOD all of my fucking car. He slit his arm or wrist and smeared the blood on my car. At this point I fucking noped my way to a phone and called my friend. After the cops took pictures and samples, he drove my car to a car wash and cleaned it for me. That is a brand fucking new car and now I don't want it anymore. 

So here's another fucked up tale. That's the second one in a month. 

Sorry for the wall of text. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1331526432.0	qsh1k	I can never repay him.	1PostAccount	131	18	51	"Sorry for my horrible writing format, I suck at writing and I just kind of tell the memory as I remember it. This is the only thing that has ever happened to me that can relate to this topic.

This all took place in Northern Delaware. Involved me 13, my brother Anthony (17), his friend Matt (16-17), and my friend Louis (12-13). It was summer time of 2007 and we were all riding our bikes to a local park that boarders the Delaware river, with New Jersey in close view across the water. Anthony and Matt loved to hang out with all their friends there and I loved even more to tag along. They were really cool friends, they never shunned me for being young and they never acted like they had to censor themselves, so as a 14 year old I thought this crowd was [the bees knees](http://larrydixon.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/bees-knees2.jpg). I always looked up to my brother, he was the epitome of cool to me. He was very smart, if you ever wanted to know something you could ask him and he knew it all. Machinery? Yep. Circuitry? Uh huh. Carpentry? Yessir! But he was also really street smart because before our father died he had raised Anthony just as he (Dad) was taught in the military. We could literally walk into a room and Anthony would sometimes say ""There are (Insert number) of people wearing (insert object)"" and I thought that was amazing it was like he was from that show ""Psych"". 

It's about 9pm and the sun is setting, which usually means the police to a quick sweep of the park since it's open from dusk till dawn. All of his friends left except his friend Matt and my friend Louis since we all lived about a 3 minute bike ride from the park. The four of us decided to find a bench along the walk path near the small shore and eat the wings we had brought with us and chat. We eat our wings for about 5 minutes when Anthony suddenly falls quiet. That's not usual since he is usually the center of conversations, but I usually know it means either two things.

1. He senses something is off.

2. He is thinking about something. 

I shrugged it off as the second since he spaces out [alot] (http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_D_Z-D2tzi14/S8TRIo4br3I/AAAAAAAACv4/Zh7_GcMlRKo/s400/ALOT.png). It's very random but he will sometimes do it in the middle of sentances while talking, so I pay it no mind. 

We keep talking and are talking about a fort we found in the woods a couple weeks ago, that we started rebuilding. About 3 minutes into the  conversation, Anthony motions his hand downward and says ""hey... Hey... Guys shut the fuck up!"" in a whispering urgent tone. He is looking off to his right, down the pathway. We knew that he knows someone is there and since there aren't too many trees in this part of the park, the moonlight makes for O K lighting. But we still couldn't see what he was looking at. I personally thought it was the patrol getting ready to leave, but when I said something to him he told me the patrol would have flash lights. 

He told us to keep talking and act normal, so that he could ""make the person/persons think we are oblivious to them so they will get closer. Knowing Anthony, I knew he could fend off most people, and I didn't help that he was in this phase where he ALWAYS carried [this] (http://www.trueswords.com/images/prod/c/TS-FTBRNSOD17_540.jpg) around with him. It is a 2ft thin blade that fit easily in the inner waist area, so it was basically going down his outer thigh. 

We started talking again, trying to face forward and not look around so we don't seem suspicious. Another couple minutes pass when I see it. Right near a crop of trees in the distance I see the silhouette of a person walking at almost molasses speed, almost as if he was doing the stereotypical burglar walk with the hunchy back and the hands near the chest.  I look at anthony while the other two keep the sound going, and let him know of what I see. Without even looking to his right, he keeps his eye locked on mine but looks as if he isn't looking at me at all, and just says ""I know I see it too"". 

we watch this guy do a half circle around is for 15 solid minutes, keeping a football fields length away the entire time. Once he gets to the opposite side of us as to where he started, he then moves in slowly. He finally comes within description view, which was about 50ft or so. At this point I guess he realized he is skulking and turns his skulk into a suave like stroll. It's so fucking weird to see someone try and change their sway like that. He was about 5'5-5'7, he had on tight black pants, with black boots that I can only describe as the boots that the Columbine kids wore, a coat that flowed to the bottom of his butt, long black hair with a receding hairline and a small goatee maybe about in his late 40's. He just kind of stood for a second like he was aloof. He let out a small cough, to start off his sentence, then proceeds to ask for a light. Louis give him a light, hoping he would be on his way and maybe just scoping out what we were up to. But he didn't, he just kept asking these throw away questions. I noticed Anthony wasn't talking so I took that as neither should I. That's when the probing questions came along ""how old are you boys"", ""you guys have girlfriends"" then he said he was a sex ed teacher. He stated his name, Keyser, yes, Keyser, then proceeds to ask for ours. Anthony says ""I don't think we need to exchange names nor answer the unnecessary questions you are asking, given the circumstance"". The guy shoots him an eye and he shoots one back ten fold. To break the ice the man asks us what we are doing out here so late and where our parents are. We answered the first question by pointing at our box of wings, but left the latter unanswered. Anthony in his sternest voice told the man ""You should probably be on your way"" while motioning his hand to his waist. He looked at me square in the eye and said ""you kids shouldn't be out this late, it's dangerous"" and slinked away to a park bench that was facing the direction out table was located and just sat there watching us. 

We get up after a couple minutes and walk across the park to our bikes. Anthony looks back and notices the guy no longer at the bench, so he fell to the back of the pack and had us walk ahead of him since the guy would have to be behind us. We get to our bikes and book it home like the speed of high particle collision. Once home we sat and talked about how awkward that was, and at the time it wasn't too scary because he just came off as kind of creepy. It wasn't until 2 weeks later when my mom (who worked for the police department) told us that 2 weeks ago there was a rape and robbery of one of the houses that is on the edge of that park. Knowing it was our common hang out, she told us she didn't want us there anywhere NEAR the sundown. I soon told my mom of said even and she flipped shit. She went to work and read the report, along with adding our description or Keyser to it. She later told Anthony a month or so later that they found a large hunting knife, and lube in a tree near the hill (Theres only 1 hill so it's THE hill) The SAME... SAAAAMMMEE hill Anthony and I noticed him first emerging from. 

I have no clue how this would have turned out if Anthony was't there. We still bring it up from time to time but it always gives me the chills."	t5_2t3t8	True
1375090541.0	1j9n5v	I still get shivers when I hear car horns	streuthguy1	139	26	15	"This happened a few years ago when I first got my driver's license, I was driving to the country for a friend's birthday. I'd worked late and had left home for the 4 hour drive by myself at 7 at night since all my friends had left before, but I really wanted to be there so I didn't mind. The area I was driving through was quiet, sparsely populated farm area, it was known to have a few weirdos around, but nothing serious. Either way, I wasn't worried when I set off.


I had been driving for ages, just listening to music and zoning out and i'd found myself on a road called Buckets Lane, a 80km stretch of road thats mostly straight and was absolutely empty at this time of night. At some point I took notice of headlights in my rear view mirror, it was the first car i'd seen in a long time, and although it seemed a long way behind me it started to catch me fast. I was driving my twenty year old Ford wagon, and was driving about 110km/h, but this guy was coming up REALLY quick.


Soon after I saw the car, I started to hear the faint noises of intermittent honking that grew louder and louder as he got closer. I'm not sure if this sounds scary, but it was really eerie. He was honking from a huge distance away for no reason, I was alone, I didn't even have phone reception. It gave me a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach, I had a strong feeling this person wanted to mess with me.
After a while this car finally pulled right up on me, I could see it looked like a black pick up with two people inside, and before I knew it he was tailgating me and still honking repeatedly. I freaked out, I was trying to wave him around me, but he wouldn't go. I didn't want to slow down but I couldn't outrun him, so I was sort of stuck. At this point he started flashing his high beams, which made it really hard to see, and then he started hitting my rear bumper, really smashing it.
I was trying to keep my shit together enough to keep my car on the road, but I was dealing with the bumping, the high beams, and the honking that was driving me insane. All this was happening at around 100km/h (60+ mph), and eventually something had to give, I swerved off the road, luckily it was on open field, slammed on the brakes, the car did a full 180 degree turn and I slid backwards into a small ditch.
I checked myself quickly, made sure I was all in one piece, the car miraculously wasn't damaged and I hadn't really crashed so I was fine. I then looked up to look for the truck. It had kept driving but it was slowing down, and then turned around, drove slowly towards me and started that fucking honking again.


I panicked big time. I put the car in reverse for some reason and slammed down on the accelerator... big mistake- I just dug the car in to the soft grass. The truck was driving in to the field towards me, at this point I realised this person was potentially dangerous, before it could have just been someone playing a stupid prank, but now they had run me off the road, and were coming back, still honking the horn, obviously not coming to see if I was ok.


They pulled up close to me, probably 20 meters off, and were shining their high beams on me so I couldn't see a thing. I was still trying to reverse out of this ditch like a moron, and finally decided to put it back in drive. By this point the honking had stopped, and someone had stepped out of the drivers door. This person was short and fat but all I could see was their silhouette, and this silhouette was now walking towards my trapped car. I took a few deep breaths, I was shaking and terrified, and slowly eased the pedal. The car was moving but my wheels were spinning and I didn't know if i'd make it out. The person moved faster now and got up to my door. I locked it in the nick of time when pulled the handle, so he just started knocking on the window. This was fucked, because he didn't bash on it, he just tapped on it, really calm, and very slowly. I begged my car to move and finally it did, i got some traction and got back on to the road and just floored it. 

The honking started again and pretty soon I saw the truck was racing to catch up with me again. FINALLY a car came in the opposite direction, I flagged him down by flashing my high beams and this middle aged woman got out of the car. I was hysterical, but once I stopped, I saw in the distance the lights of the black truck stop, turn around and zoom off in the other direction. Thank god for this woman, she calmed me down and took me to the police station. I gave a statement and everything but I didn't really see anything but a short fat silhouette and a black truck, so no help there.


No one was ever caught, and the sounds of honking horns still send shivers down my spine.


TL;DR: Got terrorised by a big black truck while driving alone at night in the countryside."	t5_2t3t8	True
1372084914.0	1gyy5v	Always trust your instincts.	kristimarie8799	138	25	118	"When I was fifteen I went to the beach with my family. One night my younger sister and I decide to walk down the main road where all of the shops and hotels are. We notice a shop advertising body jewelry. I had got my tongue pierced about six months prior and was happily looking at the tongue rings. There was a group of three guys standing near the counter talking to a man working there. The man that worked there came over and started suggesting tongue rings for me. He kept saying he thought the one with the number ""69"" on it would be perfect for me. I had always hung out with people a bit older than me so I knew what he was trying to get at so my sister and I both left very quickly. 

We got down the street some and the three guys from the first shop were behind us. They didn't say anything at first so we continued talking and enjoying the beach. Then one of them asked if we had a moment. I looked behind me thinking it couldn't be *us* he was talking to. He was at least six feet tall and maybe in his mid twenties. We kept walking and the ring leader kept asking us to stop.

The ring leader finally said ""Hey girl in the white dress. Don't ignore me!"" I stopped and turned around. I didn't say anything I just raised an eyebrow while making a circle motion with my hand as if to tell him to hurry up and say what he wanted. He did it back and I laughed it off thinking maybe he wasn't that bad since he seemed to have a sense of humor. 

He started telling me that I was ""Pretty damn sexy"" and made remarks about ""How fine dat ass looks."" I am not the type of person to take that sort of thing as a compliment. My sister and I turned around and kept walking. They continued to follow us. Each of them asking if we were single or if we were interested in a ""good time."" We ignored them until we got back to an area where there were more people. Then ring leader asked me to stop one more time. Since there were people around I decided to see what his problem was.

He kept being a general creep and saying very inappropriate things to me and my sister. He got close and acted like he was going to touch me while asking if I had a boyfriend. I did so I finally said yes and to go away. He asked me how big my boyfriend was so I told him he was a little shorter than him but built like a tank. Which was true, that boy looked like he was a body builder in training. The guy immediately apologized and walked away. My sister and I had a moment of confusion but went back to our motel room thinking nothing more about it.

A few hours later I went outside to sit in my mom's van (it was right outside the door) to call my boyfriend and tell him about what had happened earlier. We talked about it for a while and I decided to roll the window down about a fourth of the way because it was hot.  After about fifteen minutes one of the guys from the earlier group was standing outside of my mom's van. I pretended not to notice him and put my boyfriend on speaker phone so I could text my mom and ask her to come outside. 

The guy came right outside of the door and asked me to roll the window down. My boyfriend stayed quiet at that point. I said no and asked what he wanted. He said we was having a party upstairs and asked if I wanted to come up and drink a little. I told him I was only fifteen. He looked surprised, apologized a few times and left. My mom came outside about that time and asked what was going on. I told her never mind because I thought the guy seemed like he was genuinely sorry and that he had mistaken me for someone older. 

She went inside and I continued my phone conversation eventually forgetting about the guy from earlier. I had got out of my mom's van and started walking in a little circle around the pool. My boyfriend said he needed to do something and would call me back so I sat by the pool and waited for him to call me. Wouldn't you know it the same guy was walking around as well. He was carrying a trash bag and watching me as he walked to the dumpster and put the bag in it. I was so scared I didn't know what to do. For the first time I was alone in the dark near this guy who went from rude, to creepy, to just a guy who made a mistake, to someone who I felt very threatened by. He started to walk towards me when my phone rang. I answered and put my boyfriend on speaker again. The guy ran away when he heard my boyfriends voice. I left him on as I ran back to the motel room and went inside. 

I didn't tell my mom. I guess my stupid young teenage brain thought I was being more responsible and independent by ""handling it myself."" Our last night at the beach my mom, sisters, and I decided to go to the amusement park. We were about to leave when my mom realized she had lost her keys. Her van has a key code door so we were able to get in it. She told us to lock our doors and wait for her while she looked around because she had just seen her keys a from moments ago and didn't want to drag my other sister who was only at the time four around looking for them. After a few minutes she came back and said she was going to go to the help kiosk and to keep the doors locked. Before you judge her leaving us behind, the kiosk was probably a three or four minute walk from the car going at a normal pace. 

I can faintly see my mom at the kiosk talking to who I assumed to be an employee. The car was starting to get extremely hot and I had a snow cone I didn't want to melt so fast. I opened my door even though I wasn't supposed to, which both of my sisters reminded me of. I sat in the seat with my legs outside of the car so that I could turn my head one way to see my mom and the other to see my sisters in the back. I was talking to them and we were all goofing off. I felt like someone was watching me and looked in front of me to see the man from before only a few feet away but in good light. For the first time I could tell he wasn't in his mid twenties but was probably in his mid thirties. 

He asked me what I was eating and I didn't want my sisters to panic so I acted like it was okay. I said a snow cone. He came a little closer and asked if they were good and tried to explain that he had a daughter a little younger than me and he didn't know if she would like them but they looked like something she would like. I was still scared but just said ""Go get her one then."" He came closer again and asked what flavor it was. I started to panic because he was getting close enough that he could have touched the vehicle door but not me if his arms were stretched out. I didn't answer him because I was scared into silence.  He smiled at me like a starving lion would smile at a limping gazelle. I felt like I knew exactly what was going to happen. In my head I could see him grabbing me and pulling me into the bushes near by and running away with me. Just as he took a step forward that would have gave him enough room to touch me I heard my mom yell ""What the fuck are you doing near my daughter?!"" He looked stunned for a second and in that second my mom was within inches of the car. The man started to back away stammering. She yelled ""You son of a bitch get away from my fucking kids NOW!"" as she came around to my side of the car. He ran away. 

Eventually the man from the kiosk found my moms keys and we left. After we left I got a serious talking to about not keeping things from my mom and listening to her when she makes a rule. It still freaks me out when I think about what would have happened if my mom had not noticed him near me. The time span of me opening the car door and her showing back up yelling was probably only ten minutes, eight of them talking to my sisters. Sorry for the wall of  text! "	t5_2t3t8	True

About a year ago, I was driving down the highway, midday, with my family. We're all joking and having a good time being together, when I look to the right of the car and see something that was just **REALLY** off.

There's this guy wearing a hockey mask driving a sort of beat up land-rover. I point it out to the rest of my family as he drives past us. So we all look at this guy, driving down I-95, wearing a hockey mask. Then I noticed that only one of his hands is on the steering wheel, while the other is holding a baseball bat in the passenger seat.

After he passes us we all start freaking out, so we call the police and tell them what we saw and the direction he was heading.

I don't know what happened with this guy afterwards and I don't remember there being anything in the news about it, but it was one of the creepiest things that I have ever seen.



**Edit:** After consulting with my sisters, apparently it wasn't a hockey mask, but a cheap clown mask. Minor detail, but I thought I should add that."	t5_2t3t8	True
1331516290.0	qs9ky	Posted on /r/confession and was told this was also a good place to post my story 	NotEveryoneOneDies	130	17	24	"One day my mom took me to the laundromat and I decided to stay at the arcade area. It was located next to the bathrooms. I spent a couple of minutes there and from my peripheral vision I saw a glimpse of man standing behind the bathroom door. I thought nothing of it. Until I looked closer and notice that the man behind the door had his hand in his pants and was staring at me. My mom came to check up on me and I told her about the man in the restroom but as soon as she turned around he closed the door and my mom left. I was starting to get creeped out but continued to play games. Then the door opened up again. He continued doing what he was doing but this time he had took his penis out. This time I decided to leave and went outside. There was a bench outside located in front of the laundromat. Behind the bench were these large windows and you could see the seats inside the laundromat. The man that was in the restroom saw me leave and sat in the seats inside the laundromat. He had a newspaper in his hand and put it on his lap. I was thought he was going to read it but he then proceeded to take out his penis again and start to masturbate. I turned around because I did not want to watch what he was doing. Then I heard a tapping on the window and turned to see him trying to call my attention. I was very scared and decided to move somewhere else. I then saw him get up and I was terrified at this moment. He got in his car and continued to masturbate. He then tried to call me over and I don't know why but I decided to go up to him. He told me to get in his car but I knew better and was starting to walk away when he said it in a more forceful tone. I was just standing there scared not knowing what to do. My mom then came out to look for me and told me not to talk to strangers. When the man saw my mom he left immediately. My mom did not notice what was going on and just told me not to play on the parking lot. I am pretty sure if my mom would not have came out when she did I would most likely not have seen her or the rest of my family ever again. To this day I refuse to go to anymore laundromats. They give me the creeps.

Edit: It happened ten years ago at the age of six."	t5_2t3t8	True
1373168663.0	1hsabe	Guy lurking around K-mart	ambeecee	133	19	21	"Okay, so I was around 9 years old. I remember because my birthday was coming up so i had some early birthday money from family that i was going to spend. I also remember because it was the night Dale Earnhardt passed away, February 18, 2001. Anyways, I went to K-mart. It was a Super K-mart so it was pretty big. I went with my mom, Aunt Jeanine and my older cousin Amanda. Amanda is about 4 years older than me so she was like 13 at the time. 
Amanda and I wanted to look in the toy section and my mom and aunt went to look at clothes. I remember we were looking at Easy Bake Ovens. He must have heard me say her name because this guy comes up and says “Amanda?” and my cousin obviously doesn’t know who this guy is. He’s like “remember me; we met at Wal-Mart when you were with your mom getting glasses.”(She has glasses) Amanda says “no, I don’t remember” and he won’t take no for an answer and he starts saying, “Remember, my names john and my kitten scratched my contact lens that’s why I was there too” Thankfully, my cousin realizes what is going on and we walk away and he’s following. So we start running and find my mom and aunt. We tell them about it and they say that we will notify security when we get to the registers but for now just stay by them. The guy ends up walking past all of us, but does not make eye contact or even acknowledge our parents. This is weird, because if he met my aunt and cousin, then he would have acknowledged my aunt. He looks straight at me and my cousin and walks past us. We go to check out and he is walking outside. We tell the security guard and he asks if we want walked out. My mom declines for some reason, I’m not sure why.  
So as we are walking out he was already at his car and he had a bag with something he just purchased. He throws it in his car and walks back in. I always thought he walked back in to lurk other children. He was obviously a creep.

1372260316.0	1h424b	"""Silk or Cotton?"""	bigkidtable	133	22	12	"A couple weeks ago my friend Anna (22) was shopping at our local grocery store when a man sitting at a kiosk representing a credit card company stopped her and asked her to sign up for one. She refused and went on her merry way.

A week later, she went back to the same grocery store with her mother to keep her company. While she was scanning the makeup section, a voice from behind her shoulder says, “I see you’re buying makeup. Want a five dollars off coupon?” Anna turns around and it was that same man from last week who tried to get her to sign up for a credit card. A little freaked out but a person who loves deals, she follows the man back to his kiosk and she begins filling out paperwork. Five minutes later, her mom comes by with the cart and asks her what she’s doing, and she responds saying she’s getting five dollars off her makeup. The man pipes in and says, “Actually, you’re signing up for a credit card. I forgot that we don’t have those coupons anymore.” Anna what-the-fucks out of there (seeing as he was lying to her), leaving the paperwork and grocery store behind. 

A few minutes later, she receives a text from an unknown number, asking “black or white?” Anna texts back asking who it is and what are they talking about. Completely ignoring her questions, the next text sent asks, “silk or cotton?” Realizing that this unknown number was asking about her panties, she tells the stranger to fuck off and to never text her number again. She then connects the dots and realizes that she had put her cell phone number down for the man who tricked her into giving him her information.

Although the man hasn't texted her since, it’s still scary to think that he has her name, number, and home address.

1359847101.0	17s003	School Bus Creep	Pachipie	127	19	12	"To start off, I've had two very creepy encounters in my life, this was the first of them. At the time I was 11 and in 6th grade, I also developed early which might be important (I'm not sure he would have done this if he had known how young I really was.)

 I had always lived in a small sort of country town, and school had started early, one day I was waiting for the bus (I had been the only one) and then we had a neighbor in our small apartment complex. So he came out to wait for the bus as well. We started talking for a few minutes and this became a normal routine for a few months, we'd just talk some before the school bus came. Well one day during Christmas break he knocked on my door and asked if I wanted to come hang out and play in the snow. (I think he might have had some sort of mental problem because he always acted strangely childish).

 It was starting to get dark out (my parents never minded because we'd always stay in the tiny apartment complex as long as I checked in every hour or so.) We were walking in the snow and he started to talk about things that struck me as weird. (Also, he was in high school, I think a sophmore, sorry I'm not good at storytelling and this is sort of important, and the high school and middle school kids shared the bus.) He was saying how sometimes girls would walk out of the bathroom and he'd grab their crotches and they'd moan, then he said how badly he wanted to lose his virginity but was Christian so he'd have to wait until he was married. I ignored all of this, hoping to stray from the subject. At this time we were behind some of the apartments and he asked me if I wanted him to grab my crotch, I said no and told him I didn't want to talk about this, but he rushed at me and put all of his weight on me to press me against a wall, calling me a slut and saying how I wanted it. (He was a big guy and I was pretty small) He started to shove my face into the brick wall and hump me from behind, and that's when I began screaming as loud as I could. That made him run and I ran to my house (with thank god was only about 30-40 feet away.)

 Once I got inside I locked the door, I seemed very distressed so my mom asked me what was wrong and just told her I thought I saw a bear. (which was really common around there.) The next time I saw him at the bus stop I told him never to talk to me or touch me again, and he didn't say anything but laid off. A few months after that he was actually arrested for sexual molestation and disappeared from my life. I felt bad for whoever actually took action because I felt if I had spoken up it wouldn't have happened again, but overall I was just happy he got what he deserved."	t5_2t3t8	True
1343114873.0	x2aa3	Creeper at the Library	melancholymagpie	121	10	31	"This isn't as intense as some of the other stories here, but it was definitely...not great.

Working in a public library, I come across a lot of...unusual people. Mostly it's just close-talkers, or the overly chatty, or the occasional explosive outburst. But nothing quite like what happened today.

I was in the stacks, which means I was fairly isolated from the rest of the library. I was doing my usual routine, shelving books and shifting things around when I'm startled by what sounds like a sort of strangled cough. It makes me jump, but I assume it's just a patron in one of the other aisles. I grab my next stack of books and walk down to the shelf - at this point I'm pretty much in the corner of the library, though there is one shelf between me and the wall and a little walkway for safety purposes. I start putting the books away when out of the corner I see...

EYEBALLS!

PEERING RIGHT AT ME!

It's not someone looking for a book and we happen to catch eyes - this guy is staring at me intently. It is, as you can imagine, completely unnerving. Now, one of the first things we're told when we're hired is that if we ever feel the slightest bit uncomfortable because of a patron, we're to immediately grab one of our co-workers, preferably someone senior to us. But I figured, ""Hey, this is definitely weird but I only have a few books left so I might as well finish up.""

I keep putting items away and only have one or two left when I notice - again in my peripheral vision - the guy has come over to my aisle. I glance his way and then proceed to have a little conversation with myself:

""Huh, it kind of looks like...""
""No, it can't be...""
""Wait, wait, wait""
""Oh shit, he TOTALLY IS""

That's right - dude was standing in the aisle with his pants down, masturbating.

Did I mention he still was still *staring straight at my face*?

I froze for a moment, then turned and ran the 30 ft or so to the front desk. Somehow, between me leaving and coming back, the guy had disappeared, and we couldn't find him anywhere in the library. Pretty much all I could do was send out a description of him, though to be honest the only things I could recall in detail were his eyes and, you know, his penis."	t5_2t3t8	True
1343013776.0	wzx7h	Creepy Guy at Charles de Gaulle	SartreCam	136	26	41	"I just found this subreddit today, and I love it, so I figured I'd share my story. (I'm a guy for clarification.)

I was returning to France for a program where I taught English. I was very excited to be back and start teaching. The worst thing about it is flying. I really fucking hate flying, and as a smoker, to not be able to have my favorite stress reliever was horrible. 

After the nine hour flight, we finally land, and I get through customs and everything. I rush outside to have my first cigarette in what feels like an eternity. The only thing was that after not having flown in a while, I wasn't sure about the TSA's policy was on lighters, so I didn't bring any. 

I walk outside the nearest door and ask the closest person for a light. The guy was probably in his mid-forties, thin, with black-going-to-grey hair and thick-rimmed glasses.

He handed me his lighter and complimented me on my French. I thanked him, and he asked me what I was doing in France, if I was just travelling or what. I replied that I was teaching English in a smaller city. 

Here's where it gets creepy. He looks me up and down, and over his glasses he says to me in a very thick French accent, ""Euh, I could uses some lessons in Eeenglish. You should teach me sometime. I would pay well."" I was a little put off, but not wanting to be terribly rude, I just smiled and responded, ""Yeah, maybe...""

I immediately regretted that. I had forgotten that typically in France, a smile implies that you're flirting. He asked me how I was getting to my city. I told him that I was taking the train. He said that if I wanted he could drive me into Paris, and he pointed to, I kid you not, a windowless white van. Now I'm not some clod that thinks that everyone in Europe wants to kidnap and kill Americans, but my mind immediately flashed to Taken. 

I quickly made my apologies and declined. I then said that I saw someone I was supposed to meet, and dragged my bags over to a couple Russians and pretended I was with them. 

In the end, he could have been either really friendly or really creepy, but I wasn't about to take the chance. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1340228401.0	vclfu	Long Distance Relationship Ends Badly.	mezmarises	131	22	45	" Bare with me Reddit, this is the first time I've told this story since it happened and it happens to be an extremely long story. (This story takes place four years ago and requires a little history.) 

I pretty much grew up as an only child in northern Michigan. I have an older sister who is eleven years older than me who moved off to college as soon as possible. Because of this I was always extremely close to my parents, to this day we are still best friends. The one thing we all truly enjoyed was video games. When I was younger I would sit and watch my father play Laura Croft on the computer for hours, I absolutely loved it. When I was nine my parents introduced me to an MMO called Everquest.

We started off as casual players but through the years and the game's expansions we quickly advanced. By the time I was 17 I was playing constantly. It was extremely hard for me to maintain an active social life and because of this I had never had a boyfriend before. The three of us decided to apply to the highest ranked raiding guild on the server we played. That's when I met my ex and the trouble really began. Within a few weeks the raid leader had quickly taken a liking to me and not wanting to upset him, we exchanged myspaces. (Yes, that long ago.) 

I've always kept myself in decent shape and would consider myself to be fairly decent looking. He only had one picture on his myspace however and it was extremely dark and blurry. It raised a red flag that I quickly dismissed. From his myspace I learned that his name was Kurt and he was ten years older than myself, something that he had failed to mention when we first started talking. Because of his age I kept our friendship (that was quickly growing into a relationship) from my family. We began talking for hours, late at night on the phone. Within two months of us meeting, he told me he loved me and I was ecstatic to finally have someone. The relationship had always been verbally abusive, if I didn't send him multiple nude pictures or videos throughout the day he would lose his mind and tell me how fucking worthless I am. He would often remind me that I wasn't pretty enough or smart enough to find someone else that would love me, still I stayed.

Three months after hiding our relationship my parents found out. They did whatever they could to keep us apart, including taking away my cell phone, deactivating my myspace page, and threatening to delete my Everquest subscription. In the end they inevitably failed and being the foolish young girl I was, I fell even more in love with Kurt. Through the next couple months my mother had actually began to take a liking to him, he was extremely charismatic and could fool anyone. He convinced me to move to Tennessee to be with him, (admittedly I was excited about this idea.) in August of 2009 (by this time I was 18) I met him for the very first time. My parents were there to help move me into my apartment, (they were somewhat wealthy and agreed to pay for the first three months as long as I got a job and finished beauty school as soon as possible.

Almost immediately after my parents left to go back home to Michigan things started going horribly wrong. The very first night I was there I cried because it finally hit me, I gave up my entire family and all my friends to be with this man. Seeing my tears upset him and he began throwing himself at the walls, onto the bed, anything he could hit to try to hurt himself. He would tell me how worthless he felt for making me cry. 

A week later I started beauty school located just down the road from my apartment, everything was seemingly going fine. Until I started making friends. I became close to two girls, and Kurt absolutely hated this. He would accuse them of trying to break up our relationship and trying to make me cheat on him. (Though they hadn't met him and didn't know anything about him.)

He wrote me up a schedule I had to follow daily. I could go to beauty school but I had to be home within twenty minutes of the school closing. I was no longer allowed to go out by myself and going out to lunch with my two new friends was strictly forbidden. He began monitoring my cell phone and only allowed me to talk to my parents when he was around, ensuring I couldn't tell them anything without him knowing. 

A week later, he hit me for the first time. I don't remember what we were arguing about, (I've always been more of the quiet type.) but I remember him punching me in the back of the head and falling. I remember laying on the floor as he screamed at me, kicking me in the stomach, in the legs, everywhere but my face. I heard him grab my cell phone and my car keys and put them in his pocket. I closed my eyes and pretended to be asleep. In the middle of the night I woke up and was found my cell phone laying next to him, my car keys no where in site. I grabbed my phone and quickly left the apartment, making sure to make as little noise as possible. Once outside I called my mom and told her everything that had been happening. My father had been in the hospital the day before for a major surgery and my mother was already exhausted. She was also hysterical.

She told me that she was going to call Kurt's father and tell him to get the fuck out of my apartment and remove all of his shit before she called the police. (No, we never did call the police and I'm still unsure why. Mostly fear on my part I believe.) She told me to go inside and to get my keys and get out of there, her and my father would be coming down in two days to get me and move all my stuff back to Michigan. I waited a few minutes then went inside. Kurt was up and talking on the phone to his father, he began screaming and throwing furniture around (picture a blonde, slightly gay looking hulk.). He viciously grabbed me by my hair and asked me how I could do this to him. I quickly brought my right arm up and elbowed him as hard as I could in the nose. I  grabbed my purse and my keys that were on the counter, while my back was turned he grabbed a knife and tried to stab me, I effectively dodged him and kicked his arm hard enough he dropped the knife. I made my way out the door and was at the very top of the stairs leading up to our apartment when he grabbed the hood of my sweatshirt and kicked me as hard as he could down the stairs.

I was on my feet (ignoring the pain throbbing throughout my entire body.) as fast as humanly possible. I made my way to my car only a few feet away and once inside I looked back, Kurt was no where in sight. I assumed he went back the apartment to damage my belongings, I quickly sped off and called one of the friends I had made, she was more than willing to offer me a place to stay.

Two days later my parents showed up, (I'm not sure who was in rougher shape, myself or my father who was still recovering from surgery.) and I never saw Kurt again. Nor have I been back to Tennessee. In hindsight I definitely should have called the authorities, but I knew the kind of connections Kurt had and I was worried what would happen if he ever found me or my parents. 

Before the bashing starts in on my parents, in their defense they knew very, very little of the situation until it was over. My father was extremely ashamed that I was dating a man that much older than myself and made it clear several times, I however was just too stupid to listen.

TL;DR? Moved states away to be with my then boyfriend who ended up beating the hell out of me. Also, myspace.

1328348030.0	pahtc	[My] first evening without my husband at home..	kb13733	130	22	23	"My husband and I just moved into this new house that was built in 1890. So the house itself is scary as is. The neighborhood we're in is not the greatest (lots of crime, run down houses, drug central). But our house is close enough to the main street so we weren't too terribly worried about it. 

But that day was the first Friday night without my husband for me. He was changing shifts at work and ended up staying there till midnight that night. It's about 5pm when I go out to the store to grab some things and as I walk out there is this clearly homeless man riding his bike in circles in the middle of the street. His ""friend"" was pacing along the sidewalk in front of about three houses, mine was in the middle. His friend would frequently glance at the houses while discussing something with the biker and then they would continue on their way. I thought this was pretty weird and it gave me a chill so I pulled my coat a little tighter and went to the store. When I got back, they were both gone and I was pretty relieved. 

Fast forward to about 9pm. Its dark and I've locked up the house and I'm sitting at the computer, probably reading Reddit but diddling around nonetheless. Out of nowhere my border collie stands up with his hair raised and he emits this low, guttural growl. He perks his ears towards the back door and if you have ever seen a border collie stare, he was doing just that while on full alert. My other three dogs tend to ignore sounds but my border collie is pretty spot on for when things are amiss. 

I tell my dog to lay down and usually he does what I ask but he wouldn't let his eyes off the back door. My heart starts to race and I'm sitting there quietly to try and hear what my dog can hear. 

Something runs up my stairs and tries to open my back door. My dogs go crazy at this point. All four of them are barking and that's when something starts banging on my front door. My border collie immediately jumps over the baby gate and is guarding the front door while my other three dogs are still at the back, barking. I hear feet running away from my house and at this time I went into the bedroom and grabbed my husband's gun. I went to the front door first and made sure it was locked and with my border collie in front of me, I walked to the back and checked the back door.

I called my husband hysterical, and spent the next three hours cooped up on the bed with a gun and four dogs.

Probably my scariest night ever."	t5_2t3t8	True

My and my Mum were on holiday in Tunisia, I'm about 14/15. We were out having a nice day in Port el Kantaoui, took a boat ride, had lunch etc etc. During out ramblings we came across a small zoo, lovely! We were about half way round when a young man approaches us and starts chatting way, he said he was a student who has just returned from England and was really interested in chatting to us as he loved England. So we get to the end of the zoo and say goodbye, nice chatting, he looks disappointed but says his goodbyes. Mum and I continue our stroll, looking in shops mostly. Suddenly we spot him, staring at us... We pick up pace hoping to lose him and we do for a time. In the middle of the square there is a huge fountain and we stop and sit, that's when I spot him talking to a group of 6 guys (aged 15-20 or so) and pointing at us. Now we are scared, they seem to start trying to herd us out of the square, following us around the fountain. This goes on for a good 15mins. At the end of the square is a crappy theme park/hotel so we make a break for that hoping to see some security or something, no such luck. We start to panic when I notice a big burly Scottish guy that was on the boat with us earlier in the day. 

After explaining our situation to him he takes us down an alley into a taxi, as we drive away the original guy pops out of the alley obviously at a run. I did the mature thing and gave him the finger as we drove away. The full impact of what could of happened didn't come to me until a few years later and I will be forever grateful to the Scottish man, he saved us from who-knows-what that day."	t5_2t3t8	True

We had probably gone out about two dates when he decided to bring me back to his apartment. From past conversations and information my friend had given me, Paul was a business student and had worked the same job at a bookstore for the past six years. He had never worked in a medical facility.
__________
On our third date, Paul and I went to the movies and he invited me back to his apartment for a quick dinner. He opened the door of his apartment and when I took a step inside the doorway the first thing I saw was an enormous collection of what I assumed to be human organs, soaking in formaldehyde, inside mason jars.  By enormous collection, I mean approximately fifty or sixty jars lining his shelves, his coffee table, his counter tops, and basically any place you can fit sixty jars of organs in an apartment.  I didn't get the best look of what the organs were, but the ones I did see seemed to be removed tonsils.

________________

   I was in complete shock, and froze at the doorway, slowly turning to face Paul to see if he would provide some type of explanation for his serial-killer esque decor.  Paul walked into the apartment without any hesitation, as though it is completely normal to welcome a woman into your home full of body parts.  I naturally stared wide eyed for about thirty seconds, then bolted down the stairs to my car and sped home.  I never spoke to him again."	t5_2t3t8	True

When I first met my wife, she was living alone in a studio apartment near her work in Garden Grove, CA.  She is a very independent person and never had a problem with any of her neighbors.  Being young, single, and living in OC, she didn't have a car and would either take public transportation or walk.  Now, everyday on her walk to and from work, she passed by a bunch of town homes and would some times hear cat calls or rude comments in Spanish from the guys who lived there.  Not thinking too much into it she went on her way.  Until one day, a truck pulls up along side her and a Hispanic guy asks if she wants a ride.  She refused, but the guy got out and tried to drag her into his truck.  She was able to escape and run to work since she was less than a block away.  She reported it to the police, who informed her that the town homes that she passed everyday on the way to and from work were actually half-way houses for rapists and pedophiles.  They said that the guy had probably been watching her for some time before attempting to abduct her.  From then on, she was able to get a ride from one of her coworkers and didn't walk that way again.
Bonus: She also found out that the mentally handicapped guy down the hall, who was always so nice to her, was a registered child molester.

Some background, when I was  a child my mom was a drug addict. Simple as that. It was a dark time for our family, and not something I like to think about. It affected my in many ways, but I was never physically harmed. To ""start a new life."" my mom decided to move to Arizona, yet like most addicts, she and the drugs reunited even before her bis arrived in the state and darkness fell over her life once again. I was staying in our home state with some family while she was supposedly 'getting her life together' and 'making a home for us'


Fast Forward 11 years.


I am now a grown woman, and an avid redditor. I started reading letsnotmeet and I was discussing some of the chilling stories with my mother who loves scary movies and stories herself. Regrettably, I asked her what the scariest moment in her life was. (Keep in mind now she is clean, has her life together, and is much healthier)

""Do you really want to know?"" She asked.
""Yes, I guess so."" Is how I responded, thinking 'how bad could it really be?

This is, as close to her own words I can remember the event she describes. 

""When I was living in Arizona I was poor. So poor I couldn't afford a hit let alone a package of top ramen. We were living with some really scary people and I was afraid and extremely dope sick. So, I went out in to the night to sell myself for a hit. 

Eventually a man pulled up in a truck and I got in. We drove for a bit, but I kept telling him 'let's just pull over here,"" again and again and he just kept driving. We must have been 45 minutes away from Tuscon by that point. He was scary, and I was getting more and more afraid of what might happen. 

Finally, in the middle of no where we pulled up to a house and he told me to stay put, that he would be right back. He was in the house for a really, really long time. I got bored and started feeling around the car, under the seat I pulled out a giant machete. The biggest fucking machete I had ever seen. I unlocked the car door and started running down the road as far as I could. Jumping into the side of the road whenever I saw headlights, afraid it might be that guy. 

When I got far enough away I started waving down cars for help, eventually someone stopped and was kind enough to drive me back to Tuscon. I left Arizona not long after.""


So, you can see why I don't like thinking of my mother in that position, or what may have happened to her. I sometimes wonder if it was just simple quincidence about the man having the machete in his truck, or if he was actually a  killer. I guess I'll never know.

1357675891.0	1679ho	First time meeting an actual Brony (xpost from /r/Bronyhate) 	batize	205	94	89	"I went to a house party last summer which consisted mostly of geek/nerd kind of people, but outgoing ones. The usual stuff: a keg, pot and some music. People having an awesome time. 

There was this one brony guy that no one seemed to know where did he come from and he seemed to be there all by himself. The guy was 20-something but he sounded like he haven't had his voice break yet. 

He went on from one group to another and started asking questions like ""Who's your favorite MLP?"" He seemed genuinely flabbergasted that no one wanted to talk about ponies with him. He pulled this shit all night and getting more obnoxious about it while he got more drunk. 

""How come nobody wants to talk about ponies with me? People are weird."" 

I met a nice girl at the party, and we went to sleep together in one the bedrooms and closed the door behind us. Suddenly, in the middle of the night, I wake up, and the creepy Brony guy is standing in the middle of the room and staring to me and the girl sleeping naked next to each other. Not saying anything, just standing there and staring. 

I start yelling to him GET THE FUCK OUT NOW. And I had to repeat myself for a good ten times when he finally took the hint and left the room. 

I felt violated and dirty."	t5_2t3t8	True
1346092875.0	ywzuc	This is the sickest thing to ever happen	cmtel15	138	26	37	"Ok I'll start out with some background

I live in a small beach town where the only real violence happens at high school sporting events between players. This is also a well known area for havinga high cost I living and the neighborhood I love is only really gets the occasional weed smoker. Well i have a fairly typical family except that My brother is adopted and special needs (seizures and developmentally delayed) but is relatively high functioning so he hangs out with typical kids quite often and is actually quite the ladies man on campus (he's two years younger than me). He's also very trusting and friendly so he makes friends easily.

Now I'm not sure how he met this kid we'll call him ""Tyler"" but he and this kid hit it off pretty well. Tyler was a typical middle school aged boy who was very polite and always nice to my brother. They would go to the movies and get ice cream at the local shopping center about half a mile away. My brother even attended his bar mitzvah and I worked it. 

Although this kid was nice, he always seemed a bit strange mostly jus kind of a geeky kid who would still play Pokemon in middle school (for the record this was 6 years or more after Pokemon kinda faded into other things) but I never really figured anything of it seeing as most of my brothers friends were kind of geeky. Well one day my brother comes home looking clearly upset and tells us that him and Tyler got in a fight which we played off like no big deal seeing as friends fight. But after this fight my brother starts to act very distant. He won't give my dad a hug anymore or even let our dad touch him so we know something is wrong. This lasts for two years along with other social and emotional problems that come with a special needs child learning that he'a different (very sad). My brother takes up running away when he gets upset and other things. 

Finally after two years of this happening and me being gone at college for a year my parents explain to me what happened between him and Tyler.

So apparently they never really had a fight but they had been hangin out at Tyler's house and Tyler thought My brother an easy target so molested him. Needless to say as an older brother I would not mind beating the shit out of this kid and making his life as miserable as its been for my family the last two years.


TL;DR my younger special needs brother was molested by a child child molester. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1343860848.0	xj4x1	He followed me there	Nerflet	132	22	34	"I was in the process of applying to university a couple of years ago.  I was overjoyed to receive a notification asking me to come to interview at the Cambridge college of my choice. We didn't have a car or much money but I was determined to find a way, even if it meant me going alone (the tickets were £90 ($140), and the college would only provide one single room for interview candidates). The trip would mean I had to travel 200+ miles alone and swap several trains, but I'd done it once before for a summer school and figured I'd have no problems.

I got off at the train station in a city I'd never been to before, and all I had to navigate was a vague Google maps printout of the college I needed to head to. Now, the place I was interviewing at wasn't exactly out in the middle of nowhere, but it wasn't central enough for there to be streetmaps pointing the way, as there are for the other ones (which attract a lot of tourism). My sense of direction's never been great, and I quickly got lost, even though the college was less than a mile from the train station.

I was wandering around the city, and it'd been an hour or something and I was starting to get worried. My interview wasn't until the following day (they'd told me I could stay the night since the journey would take most of the day), so I wasn't worried about missing it. That being said, it was starting to rain and my backpack with interview clothes and some books I wanted to brush up on was pretty heavy. I was feeling nervous anyway, and I started to get myself worked up pacing the streets and trying to find out where the hell I was going to. It started to rain and I felt close to tears, really wishing my mum had come with me.

That's when the guy turned up. He was maybe in his 40s, probably about six feet tall to my 5""6', heavy set with little round glasses. He looked normal enough - maybe like a teacher or something, and I ignored him and stepped to the side of the road, still obviously studying my Google Maps printout. I looked up after a few minutes and saw that he was still standing there. His expression was sort of vacant and smiley. It weirded me out, but I said nothing, and after a moment I realised that I was standing near a bus stop. I figured he was probably waiting for the bus. That's when he cleared his throat and started talking to me.

""Where are you looking for, darling?"" he asked, and I was scared, because in my experience nobody voluntarily helps out tourists, and that's what I looked like. I looked up, and dumbly told him the name of the Cambridge college I needed to get to. I even tried for a smile, even though I was exhausted and feeling teary. I'm pretty socially awkward so even talking to a random guy has my palms sweating. Something about the slimy way he said 'darling' was off, too, but I figured I was just being paranoid.

""Oh, that's miles away from here - do you want me to show you?""

I thought he meant on the map I was holding, so I meekly offered it out to him. He ignored it, though, and picked up the bag he was holding and immediately started walking away from me, as if to get me to follow. I stayed where I was, and shook my head, telling him that it was okay, I was sure I would find it - and if not, I'd go to the train station and take a taxi, because I remembered the way back.

Once I'd said it, I felt intensely stupid, because I knew I'd essentially just told a creepy guy where I was going, and it was starting to get dark. I was lost in a city I didn't know and as I headed away from him, my heart was beating in my chest a little too quickly. My steps were a bit shaky, too, but I felt instantly better the second I had got some space between us.

I wandered around for another hour and figured I was utterly lost. I start to believe what the guy had said about being miles away from my destination. Figuring it was best if I got to the college before it got past twilight, I headed back in the direction of the train station, following the very clear signposts to guide me. That's when I saw him again. This time he was in a car stopped at traffic lights.

I kept walking, but as the other cars pulled away his slowed to a stop near me. Again, I kept going, but this time I'm looking around me for other people in slight terror. Despite the fact that it was a busy city and was the middle of the day there was not much in the way of traffic or people on the streets. I felt a bit sick with nervousness as he wound down the window of the car and gestured for me to come closer. I didn't, standing my ground on the pavement, but I did look in his direction.

""You're still lost?"" he asked, and grinned at me. I nodded quietly and looked up the road; the train station was right up ahead and there were rows of taxis just lined there, safe and snug for me to climb into. 

""My son's interviewing at Oxford, you must be scared, all by yourself."" 

I gave him a little smile, and somehow the words 'all by yourself' hung in my mind, and I felt intensely vulnerable. I just wanted to get out of there and slide into a licensed taxi with a big guy at the wheel. I swallowed and waited for him to drive off, but he didn't. I kept walking.

""Hop in, and I'll take you straight there. It's on my way home, it'll only take five minutes.""

I shook my head quickly, and it was like my voice was stolen. As soon as it came back, my voice is a little more stern than I'd meant as I said 'no way'. I was scared, and I knew this guy knew where I was going. I kept walking, picking up my pace, and the gray car followed me, crawling behind.

""Are you sure? It's just around the corner. I'd be happy to give you a lift...""

Again, I said no, and at this point I was scared stiff. I could see the bright, safe lights of the taxi rank up ahead, and I practically broke into a run down the last stretch of road, threw myself into one of them, and shouted the destination at the driver. He gave me a weird look, and I settled back into the seat, my heart still thudding. Two minutes later, I ducked down as we drove up to the gray car with the creepy guy and pulled up beside him at the traffic lights.

The look he gave me was indescribable. It was something between a glare and a sneer, eyes glinting, and as he pulled away in a cloud of exhaust I knew that I'd made the right decision."	t5_2t3t8	True
1340273553.0	vdjc2	Scared Me and My Pony	brundle_fly	126	16	22	"Been lurking here all day at work and thought I'd share.

This was about 6 year ago during my freshman year of high school.  For background: I'm in college 6 hours away now, but my family still lives here.  My house is on about 3 acres of land in South Florida close to the everglades (like close enough to have alligators show up in puddles around the neighborhood).  We have a barn in the back yard that's stalls let out into little paddocks.  we are surround by other houses that are all on about 3 acres as well.

Anyway.  We had 3 horses at the time of this story: My spunky old pony Sargent, my sister's flighty mare Candy, and our mom' friend's old gelding John.  Basically Sargent and Candy shared a stall (they got along really well and the stalls had little run-out paddocks so they had plenty of room) and John had the other stall.

I was in charge of feeding the horses every night.  My mom had read an article about feeding your horse smaller meals 4 times a day rather then 2 (my mom is a crazy animal person) to ease their tummies or something.  So at this time I would feed them grain and a pad of hay each at 7:30PM and then a pad of hay each later right before I went to bed.

I should also mention that our property is a bit creepy at night.  There are no street lights on my street so it can be quite dark.  

One night I go down to the barn around 10PM to throw the horses their last pad but when I turn on the barn light I see Candy and John waiting to be fed but no Sargent.  This is odd since Sargent is a little shit fat pony and knows when he hears foot steps that its food time.

I look in the little paddock attached to Candy and Sargent's stall and there's Sargent, tied to the fence with a halter and lead rope.  I think its odd but i reason that maybe my sister came out and brushed him or something.  We're both teenagers and whenever something bothered us we would go out and pet horses, so not really too weird. I also noticed that the stalls (both of them) were not properly locked.  I make a mental note to tell my sister not to be careless and feed the horses and go to bed.  I forgot about the mental note.

A few days go by and nothing happens.  i forget about the whole thing.  Then one night I go out to feed their last pad at 10PM again.  This time I think its kind of weird because the barn light is on. I just figure someone forgot to turn it off earlier and go about my business.  This time both Sargent and Candy are tied up to the fence and John, who is a pretty mellow boy, looks freaked out. The locks are also not on the right way.   I untie the horses feed them and haul ass back up to the house.  I wake up my mom and tell her what happened and she agrees that its weird and maybe its some asshole kids.

The next day we buy a couple pad locks and my dad sets up a motion detector light in the barn. we put the pad locks on the horse's stall locks.  

A couple days go by and nothing happens.  I'm watching tv in our living room around 9PM with my mom.  For reference our living room has these glass sliding doors that you can see out to the backyard through, clearly seeing the barn.  All the sudden we see the motion light turn on over at the barn.  At first we see nothing, and we think it's just one of the barn cats, so we go back to the tv.  

Something makes me look again a minute later though and i see this guy (or I think so, couldn't see his face, could have been a lady but the build says man to me) all in black petting the horses.  I freak out and my mom jumps up and opens the slider door to the backyard and screams ""GET THE FUCK OUTA MY BARN!  GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM MY HORSES!""

they guy sprints off and we call the cops.  The cops can't really do anything though since he's gone.  We never saw the guy again and have had nothing like it happen since.  

My mom worries that he might have been trying to steal the horses. This isn't super uncommon and usually the horses get sold to illegal meat markets.  I dunno though.  He never hurt them and always tied them up inside the stalls.  I think the guy just might have wanted to pet some ponies...

TL;DR guy petted my ponies without asking"	t5_2t3t8	True
1376237937.0	1k5dzc	The Man in the Doorway	will_fart_on_yourcat	134	26	35	"This happened just 7 hours ago.  

Background:
I'm a male living in a college town slightly off-campus in a duplex.  This town isn't the safest town in America, but the part of town I live in doesn't seem to have much trouble besides the occasional robbery, etc.  I live with 6 other people, but they come in and out each day.  Last night there were only me and three others.  I live in the basement of the house in a double room (I'm the only one in this room for the summer) and my floor-mate is on the other side of the basement.  There is a door from the outside that leads to the basement, and only my floor-mate and myself have the key to unlock this door.  My room is small; it can barely fit two twin beds into it and my door is on the opposite side of the room from my bed. 


Anyway, it was a normal Saturday.  I had woken up super early and decided to just be lazy all day.  Around 10pm, I decided to get into bed and watch some South park.  I had fallen asleep around midnight I think.  The actual encounter happened very fast.

I had woken up at 4:43am with an overwhelming feeling of dread.  It was dark, but it only took me a few seconds for my eyes to adjust to my surroundings.  I looked at my clock with is right next to the door and I noticed a figure standing in the doorway no more than 8 feet from me.  He was staring at me with a sickest grin I have ever seen.  The guy was a fucking monster, ugly and big as hell.  I froze.  I had no idea what was happening.  

I jumped out of bed after a few seconds and yelled, ""Who is that?  Get the fuck out of here, now!""  As I rushed to the door to slam it shut, the man slowly closed the door, still staring at me with that malicious grin.  I locked the door and heard heavy footsteps walk away very slowly.  This guy wasn't here to rob me, I can tell you that.  The way he shut my door was too calm for any 2-bit thief that just got caught B&amp;E.  

I heard him walk to the basement door, and he left.  I immediately called the cops and they showed up within minutes.  They did a walk-through of my house and just chalked it up to some drunk guy wandering through houses.  I told them that this guy could've been watching me for hours for all I knew, but they obviously dismissed it.

They left and I woke up my floor-mate (a girl) who was asleep throughout the whole ordeal.  She had gotten in a few hours after I fell asleep and she said she locked both the deadbolt and the normal lock.  They were both unlocked.  Well, simple solution: I change the locks.  Fine.

But the thing that worries me the most is that this guy specifically came into MY house.  I don't know how he got in, and I don't know if he's watching me or someone in the house, but I am freaked the fuck out.  Once I told everyone that was home, they didn't seem very concerned.  What the flying fuck?  I guess their opinions would change if they had seen this man like I had.  His grin was so eerie, and his face was messed up.  But the way he just calmly shut my door as I charged towards him is actually nauseating. 

Today, I change the locks and find myself a baseball bat.  I'll gladly take any other suggestions.

1374964570.0	1j6o7c	at least he didn't have a gun? (long)	ectopia	131	19	30	"First off, I work at an independent video store in a highly residential, nuclear-family infested neighbourhood. We don't have any porn, but we do have a lot of fancy shmancy Criterion movies and other critically acclaimed international titles that are hard to come by. Most of our customers are regulars, and a lot of them have been coming to our store for 15+ years. I am a petite, girly blonde in my mid-twenties. I love movies, and I love my job - but it doesn't pay extremely well. 

This particular encounter happened roughly two years ago. It was during the summer, so a few of my co-workers were on vacation and I had taken as many extra shifts as I possibly could (working somewhere between 30-40 hours a week). My mother lived within short walking distance from the store, so I didn't have a problem taking a few closing shifts at the time. The store is pretty small, so I always ended up closing alone. 

This all happened at about 9:30pm, half an hour before closing time. This guy stomps into the store, dressed in baggy black clothing. I remember noticing him because he legit looked like Xzibit. Anyways, he comes in, and immediately goes to the very back of the store where we kept all our blu-rays. Our shelves aren't very tall, so I can see his head poking through. I go back to work, and fifteen minutes later I realize that we're the only two people left in the store, and that he's still in the exact same spot in the blu-ray section, staring at me. I'm a little startled, but I stare back until he looks away. Closing time is fast approaching so I decide to go talk to him, see if maybe he needs help choosing a film or whatever. 

When I finally approach him, I immediately notice that he looks like he's about to piss his pants. He looks crazy anxious. His eyes are darting all over the room. I give him my usual speech, tell him I have to lock the door in less than five minutes and offer to help him choose something quickly. He stammers something along the lines of ""oh... i uh.. she's the one who sent me here... she wanted something funny... i never... she's... it won't take me long..."" I notice that he keeps playing with what I assume to be his belt. I can't see what he's doing because of his long baggy t-shirt, but I know he's playing with something at the back of his pants, at waist level. I start to suspect he might be concealing a weapon, and that he's planning a hold-up. 

I do my best to hide how scared I am and head back to the counter. I have the strength of a wet noodle, so I had no intention of trying to be a hero. I was going to give him everything in the register, but I knew he'd probably be disappointed by how little was in there (no more than 400$). Unfortunately, my boss hadn't deposited the money in the safe under the counter in over two weeks so I began to pray that this guy wouldn't ask me to open it. Because it isn't actually visible, I figured there was a chance he didn't know it was there so I did my best to conceal it entirely. 

Finally, he starts walking towards the counter and says he's not going to rent anything. I was doing my best to look busy, all while keeping him in my peripheral. He stopped about a foot in front of the counter, directly in front of me, I could tell he was holding something in his left hand and my heart sank. I looked at it, expecting to see a gun or a knife. Thankfully, it was just his penis. Just an average, semi-hard penis. I heaved a sigh of relief and began my closing routine. 

The flasher seemed confused by my reaction, and I guess he thought I didn't look at it because he began contorting his body so his dick was in better view, trying to get my attention by saying random shit like ""uh so uhhh I'm leaving? uh, goodnight then?"". So I looked up at him, looked back down at his dick and said ""Yeah, whatever."" He seemed even more confused at this point and left quietly. 

I called the cops, but nothing much happened. They had me look at some mugshots, but none of them looked anything like Xzibit. I figured I'd probably never see this guy again, because I assumed my reaction disappointed him since I knew for a fact that it didn't get him fully hard. Wrong.

Two months later I am working a day shift by myself on a Wednesday. The flasher staggers in, still wearing baggy clothes but this time everything is bright yellow. He comes up to the counter and starts awkwardly trying to chat me up, he points to the red writing on his blindingly yellow baseball cap and says ""Hey Mama, see this? What's it say?"" I totally can't help side-eyeing him as I answer ""Draid?"" he ignores my obvious lack of interest and chuckles ""Yeah girl, that's my name! What's yours?"" I lie and say my name is Deborah ""Do you work here a lot, Deb?"" 

At this point, I don't feel like playing along anymore so I do my best to sound as tough as I possibly can. ""Why the FUCK do you want to know?"" his smile instantly fades and he begins to stammer, and he proceeds to give me possibly the most absurd explanation I have ever heard ""Oh uh... well uh... y'see... I um I have this TWIN brother and like, he's kind of shady and like, he said he comes here a lot... so uh... if he ever did anything shady in your store um... like, I wouldn't want you to think it was me... cuz I'm not shady... but my TWIN is..."" I think I actually snorted. ""Alright Draid, whatever. I do work here a fair amount and it's possible your twin came in while I was here but he clearly didn't make much of an impression."" He seemed disappointed by this, shrugged and said ""Oh... Ok... Well uh that's good..."" and pretended to look at movies for about five minutes before bolting out of the store. 

Once more, I stupidly assumed that would be my last encounter with him. I wanted him to think that he hadn't left an impression on me, since he clearly gets off on shocking people. I thought that by telling him that I didn't remember him, he'd be discouraged. Sadly, he had more of a ""Challenge: Accepted!"" attitude.

I didn't work night shifts for a good six months after this, but when I finally took one as a favour to a co-worker... yeah. Flasher shows up. I was already having a pretty shitty night, so by the time he entered the store I was already in a sour mood. 

He walks in wearing his all-black outfit, has a big grin on his face and turns to me and says ""Hey, girl. Remember me?"" I was pissed. I could barely conceal my anger when I answered. ""Why would I?"" he seemed to lose some of his initial confidence and blurted ""oh... guess I got the wrong girl..."" 

He goes back to the same corner as he did the first time, peeking at me over the shelves from the back of the store. My cheeks were burning with rage. It really pissed me off that this guy kept coming back, that the cops would do pretty much nothing about it since he'd totally have time to run away before they got here, and that my fucking boss STILL hadn't installed security cameras. All he did was give me a ""beatdown stick"" (it's a heavy, wooden table leg with sharp corners and a duct tape handle.)

I knew from experience that he'd still be staring at me so I looked up and made eye-contact. I glared at him. Since acting indifferent didn't work, I took a different approach. I wanted to scare the fuck out of him. I yelled at him from across the store ""WHAT DO YOU WANT? YOU'RE STARING AT ME. DO YOU NEED HELP? YOU KEEP STARING AT ME LIKE YOU NEED SOMETHING"" he began to shake his head. ""NO? YOU DON'T NEED ANYTHING? YOU SURE? YOU'RE STILL STARING AT ME LIKE YOU NEED SOMETHING"" he shook his head some more. ""ALRIGHT WELL IF YOU DON'T NEED ANYTHING STOP STARING AT ME."" his head shot down. 

I pulled out the beatdown stick and rested it over my shoulder like a baseball bat. I still wanted to scare him, but I was aware that being a petite little blond girl in a pink sequin dress didn't make me look like much of a threat. So I decided to make myself look like a crazy maniac. Before he came in the store, I was watching It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia so I figured I would just pretend to keep my attention on the show, all while exaggerating all of my reactions to it. I started yelling at the screen, like ""HAHAHAHA WHAT CRAZY MOTHERFUCKERS HAHAHA SO FUCKING HILARIOUS""  I made sure my laughter sounded fake and angry, and waved the beatdown stick a few times. It took about ten minutes but yeah, he ran out of the store FAST. 

So yeah, I haven't seen him since and I really hope I don't either 'cause fuck I am out of ideas now. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1358295034.0	16ngmq	Baby	Booty-B	150	42	19	"If you're new to my stories, [here is the first one](http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/16jgge/artie/) [and the second one](http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/16l601/seriously_artie_stop/) this is the last big story I have of Artie. I'll make one more post about a few of the other little things he did before and after the restraining order.

It was close to the end of the summer. I was going to start my junior year in two weeks, and I was trying to get in as much summer fun as I could before I had to go back to school. I had decided to block Artie's number and block him on facebook as well. I didn't want him to have any way to contact me. 

I was still living with my grandmother. I had decided to live with her full time because she needed help around the house and I worked at the daycare she ran. Artie didn't know where I was living now, so I felt pretty safe. 

I was out walking my dog, Maggie, during the early evening. Right before the sun was going to go down. I know my neighborhood very well, I know all the relatively safe places to go, plus I had Maggie with me (a lab-pitbull cross, very bulky dog) I didn't feel in the least bit concerned for my safety.

I was halfway through my walk, when Maggie perked up her ears and looked across the street. I followed the direction of her eyes, and who do you think I saw? Artie. He was matching his pace to mine, but he wasn't looking at me, it looked like his was texting on his phone. I hoped he hadn't noticed me. I quickly turned the corner that would take me back to the street my house was on. I was hoping Artie would turn the opposite way. I wasn't so lucky though, he kept following me, but remained across the street. I quickened my pace, so did he. I walked a little faster, so did he. I broke into a run, so did he. I decided to stop and face him.

I turned towards him and yelled ""Artie, I have pepper spray! Leave me alone!"" All he did was look at me. He made no move to cross the street. He just looked. Then, he made his arms into a cradle, and did the sign for baby.

This needs to be explained. His sister Ivonne has always called me baby in sign language. It was something very special and deeply personal to me. She is the only person allowed to use that sign when referring to me. When Artie used that sign, I felt violated in a way that I'm not sure I can explain.

At this point Artie started to cross the street, I tried to move away towards the nearest house, but Maggie wouldn't budge. Sensing my distress, she had started growling at Artie when he made a move to come across the street. The closer he got, the more frantic she became. Tugging at the leash, snarling, and overall just being as menacing as she could. That stopped Artie in his tracks. My dog is powerful, I had been tugging on the leash this whole time, trying to get her to move. Artie could see her power and seemed to be put off by it. 

The person in the house nearest to us finally opened their door and asked what was going on, probably thinking that they were witnessing what could potentially be an animal attack. I think Artie decided not to risk it. He quickly walked off and Maggie calmed down enough where I could get her to walk with me to the house. I told the person at the door what had happened and asked him to call the cops. I was hoping maybe everything that had happened so far would warrant a reason for Artie to be arrested or something. I don't know, I was too upset to think of anything else. The man agreed and stood outside with me until the cops came. 

I told them what had happened and they urged me to get a restraining order. They then called my mom and told her the same thing. They took me home and promised to patrol just in case Artie tried to come over. 

I don't know if they really did patrol the neighborhood, but either way I didn't feel safe. I felt violated and angry. My mom agreed that a restraining order would be the best means of action against Artie. I feel a little safer with it, but in the end, if he decides he really wants to do something fucked up to me, the restraining order won't stop him. It's going to take me awhile to feel safe again. 

Note: After this incident, Ivonne and I drifted apart. It makes me very sad to say this. Neither of us could see past the incident. She is a wonderful girl and I feel bad that she has a horrible brother.

1354538316.0	1474h3	My Birth Certificate	brr42	144	35	31	"Hi everyone! I am 20, female, born in the States but I've been living in Italy for fifteen years because my father is in the Italian Air Force.
This isn't very exciting or creepy but it sure scared the hell out of me.
When I was about fifteen, my friend and I decided we would google our names and see what came up. 
Well, the results for my name were a porn star's home page (haha okay), some other stuff that had nothing to do with me, and then one that clearly stated my name, last name and date of birth. I obviously clicked it.
It turned out to be a page on a website where emerging writers post their poems or stories. 
What I found was my birth certificate, completely translated in Italian. Some fucker had gotten his hands on my American birth certificate and even taken the time to translate it.
So I checked out the other files submitted by this user and found a bunch of random documents of different foreign people, like a Romanian woman's residence permit and an Ethyopian couple's marriage certificate, all translated in Italian. All these people happened to live around my area, as I figured out by some of the documents.
I called my parents and asked them if they knew anything about it, and they had no idea. We ended up calling and asking some people, like my mom's old job (she taught English in a private school, where many foreigners who needed to learn Italian could be found) to see if maybe they had posted these documents for, I dunno, bureaucratic reasons. Which still would have been pretty weird.
Nobody had a clue as to why my birth certificate was online and my fervid immagination lead me to be scared shitless. Some Italian xenophobe country bumpkin was watching me and wanted to break in my house and kill me, I was sure of it.
My parents contacted the website and told them what was going on, and soon after that the page and user were both gone.
Obviously nothing ever happened to me but I still sometimes wonder what the hell was going on.

TL;DR: Googled my name, found that some weirdo had translated my American birth certificate in Italian and posted it on a website/blog for writers.

BTW, I'm sorry but I do not remember the name of the website."	t5_2t3t8	True
1353037549.0	13a3y1	Obsessed	PantheraLupus	128	20	63	"So this is my first /r/LetsNotMeet story. I have a few to tell.

Well, this one is recent, and is still an ongoing problem so advice would also be appreciated.

Just over a year ago we had recently moved to my home town. I wasn't quite 18 so nobody wanted to approve my fiancé (who was 22) and I for a house (rental, of course). So we were forced to move into a cabin in a caravan park. (I believe many of you would refer to this as a trailer park?). My fiancé didn't know many people here so he would just go about his business, going to work and coming home. Not really going out to see friends. He had given up smoking weed and all since it was mostly a social thing.

Then he started talking to this 37 year old guy named John who worked and lived at the caravan park, who happened to be a stoner. He invited him over a long with a few other young male friends and they'd all smoke together.

It was okay for a while. I went with them once and was pretty horrified at the living conditions of this guy. A decrepit old caravan, obviously hadn't been cleaned at all inside or out for years. It smelt and was so grimy and disgusting I had to try pretty hard to not let my disgust show, because that's the polite thing to do.

He smelt really bad, too. I later found out he almost never showers and hasn't washed his clothes in a very long time. I guess these are the signs of someone who is quite mentally ill.

Slowly, he began to act weird. Chucked tantrums over silly thing like claiming someone else's lighter was his. Our friend accidentally stumbled onto gay porn on his computer (which he flat out denied and said it was our friend who was watching it). He started to get overly weird towards my fiancé.

Slowly, everybody stopped going to his caravan except my fiancé. And that's when the text messages started. One minute he would send a text message to my fiancé calling him gay and accusing him of sleeping with all these guys, and that he had it on camera. The next he would beg forgiveness. It got so bad that upon waking up of a morning, my fiancé would have between 40 and 100 unread messages on his phone.

We reported to management about this but they couldn't do much. The third time we complained, they fired him but let him stay in the caravan still.

And then it got even worse. The messages would sometimes even say ""I'm sorry I love you bro"" and even ""joke"" about wanting a blowjob, or would offer to give my boyfriend a blowjob if he would just get him some weed (he didn't know anybody else to get him any) or if he would just hang out with him.

Then he would say stuff about me (I can't remember exactly what, but it was an attempt to both anger me and my fiancé and damage our relationship). He would direct some messages at me, claiming that when my fiancé said he was just going to the bathroom, he was really going to John's and having sex with him.

At night I would hear someone snooping around our van (we had moved into our own caravan by then, since the rent was cheaper if we owned it). I'm almost certain it was him.

This made us all the more desperate to move. So we did finally. He never left us alone. The messages kept coming. My fiancé would occasionally reply and I'll admit, I sent him a few that would have completely fucked with his head and emotions. I think I may still have them on my phone from when my fiancé put his sim in it for a while.

Eventually he got rid of that simcard. We got a home phone and Internet. Forgot about him for a while. And then the desperate creep started messaging my fiancé on Facebook. He would say all this creepy stuff. He threatened that he would get a gun and shoot me and my new kitten (he must have stalked my Facebook or something to now about that). 

We went to the police several times, they wouldn't do anything.

He would say that ""I have that video of you and Allan having sex, I saw it through the curtains and taped it. I'll send it to your missus."" And all this crap. Then he made a fake profile under the name of ""Nathan Green"" and pretended to be his own friend and would message my boyfriend from there as well. (And they were the same person, the profile is obviously fake and their dialogue is identical. You learn to tell who's who when you have countless e-friends who have their profiles deactivated and have to choose a different name.)

Even looking at his profile now creeps me out. For over a year most of his posts are referring to me or my fiancé. And his fake profile talking to himself about me and my fiancé. He even has the nerve to refer to both of us as speed junkies (which we most certainly are NOT), and in several posts even talks about having us killed.

He got our home phone number and would call at ridiculous hours and breath then hang up.

A few months into my pregnancy, I woke up (completely starkers, mind you. When you're pregnant I swear sitting in an ice bath would still be hot) to a policeman barging into my room and demanding I get up and put some clothes on. They raided our house and completely trashed it and broke things unnecessarily . Someone had reported that we had a meth lab. It was obvious who it was, and he even messaged me admitting to it. And admitting to the phone calls as well. He blocked me shortly after.

At this point, I developed antenatal depression and couldn't even bring myself to clean up the mess left behind by the police. The depression eventually led to the premature birth of my little girl.

And still the phone calls and messages came. We rang Telstra several times but they said it wasn't a good enough reason to change the number.

And the, it got creepier. He started saying eerily accurate things about our sex life. Now, if someone were to stand right at the window of the kitchen they would be able to peek through the gap in the curtains and see directly into the bedroom. 

He would make comments about the condition of our car and the caravan sitting out the front. Because Telstra, despite us requesting otherwise, had posted our details online. Which is how he got our number in the first place.

Finally, after bringing the baby home and having her woken up far too often by this guy and his phone calls, Telstra agreed to change our number and make it private. The calls still continued, it turns out they still made it public. So we had to change it a second time. We're finally free from the calls but not the messages and my fiancé refuses to block him.

 Recently I've also found out that he impregnated a 13 year old girl and then sexually abused the resulting little boy. He has also admitted this to several people.

Seriously, this freaks me out. He's obsessed with my boyfriend and jealous as well, not to mention mentally ill. What if he snaps one day, breaks in and harms our baby and I? It scares me when I think about it.

TL:DR Fiancé meets creepy 37 year old who becomes obsessed and or falls in love with him and won't leave us the hell alone.

EDIT: He has also recently made a third profile and subscribed to my public Facebook updates and keeps commenting referring to my fiancé on the few posts that I make public."	t5_2t3t8	True
1345003109.0	y8srx	"""I can cut your grass"""	sociallyawkwardpoet	132	19	19	"long time lurker, found this sub reddit on the random setting  and have been in love every since. here we go.....

so, came to visit my dad. nice neighborhood, small town outside of a big city. not much crime, mostly kids pulling minor vandalism shenanigans. 

I have two small sons, four year old and a three month old. we were waiting for my dad to come home with dinner. he calls, says he'll be here soon. 

knock at the  back door. my older son runs to the door to open it as I yell, ""whats the password,"" thinking it's my dad with his hands full. double lock is on, kid can't get out open, I come behind my son to the door with my three month old in  my arms. 

I hear a mumble, that immediately is unrecognizable and I lift the blinds to reveal a very old man. disheveled, dirty, bloodshot jumping eyes. he is at least in his 70s.  (side note; my father is a pastor.) I assume it is someone from his church, they often stop by with food, concerns, etc. it's a close knit community and most of his parishioners live nearby.  convinced it is either one of them, or some guy down on his luck stopping by  to ask for some help. again, close knit community, most everyone knows my dad and that he is a minster at the  church a few blocks over. 

I, stupidly answer, ""dad is not here,"" hand on the knob, ""did you need me to tell him something?""  he answers in a raspy, wavering voice. ""I can cut your grass, forty dollars for the whole yard.""

at this point, my creeper senses are up. remember, this guy is easily in his 70s, pretty frail looking, awkward smirk on his face. 

""um, I'm not the home owner. my father will be home soon, you can stick around if you want down by the road."" he shuffles off. I am pretty paranoid, I am on this subreddit way too often. automatically think the worse. 

take my kids to the kitchen. best place to see all three doors. it is a tri-level house. I would have a good head start if he came in the basement, can see directly the front door and sliding glass door on patio. I sneak a knife behind my back. didn't want to freak out  my older son, who is bugging me to go downstairs and play. distract him with fruit snacks. call my dad. warn him of creepy guy that may still be waiting, he shrugs me off  and says he'll be here soon. 

I stay in the kitchen until he gets here. ask the if the guy was still there he says yes, he was around the back end of the car port, and asked again if we needed our grass cut. dad politely declines and proceeds to make fun of me for the next hour for thinking the old man was going to do anything.

I go out later for a smoke on the back screened in patio, and immediately notice the screen in the door is sliced across the bottom and along the side where the handle is. scream for my father, we call the cops and the guy next door who is a state trooper, cops take description, promise to patrol the area. neighbor moves his cop car to the front of our house  to ward off the guy if he tried to cine back. 

I can only imagine what would have happened if my dad  didn't get here and I wasnt on edge thanks to  you guys."	t5_2t3t8	True
1374142801.0	1iju10	followed by a creep in a car	holyrandom	131	22	3	"I was 14 when I started walking back home from school alone. My brother used to walk with me, but he had finished school the year before. It wasn't a long distance and the route I always took was pretty busy all the time. 

One day I was very bored and decided to take another street. It was parallel to other one, it wouldn't make a difference. But this other street was deserted, not a single person or car passing by. I wasn't scared or anything, just glad I had new things to look at. 

At some point a car slowed down beside me and the guy inside started talking to me. ""Hey gorgeous, come with me. What's your name? You look amazing. Ride with me?"" I never looked his way and started walking faster but he kept following me. He started saying nastier things and became angrier, ""little bitch, come in or I'll kill you"". I had nowhere to run, there were only houses around me, no shops or things like that. He followed me for about 10 minutes and at this point I was shaking pretty bad and just looking at the ground thinking ""I'm gonna die right now"". Then he finally accelerated his car and went away. I looked up and there was a guy walking towards me and the creep probably chickened out when he saw him. I stopped, hyperventilated like crazy for a while and then ran home.

1371327518.0	1gf02v	Creepy next door neighbor	whambamthankyouma_am	124	16	5	"This is my first time posting on this sub, so bear with me.

When I was about four (sixteen or so years ago), my family moved from a rough part of the state to a nice city. It was typical suburban bliss; white fences, picturesque homes all with nice, lush yards. My sister and I were about twelve and four when we moved.

Our next door neighbor, Gene, was an older man in his late sixties, early seventies who had just recently married Kathryn, another woman in her mid sixties. My parents were friendly with Gene and got the notion that Kathryn and Gene had been married before which wasn't a big deal, but plays into the story later.

I always got the creepy vibe from Gene. One of my best friends lived in the house behind me so I often passed Gene's house to visit her house. Gene's favorite hobby was to sit on a lawn chair in his driveway and every time I passed, he made it a point to talk to me, more so than the friendly neighborhood talk. One time, I was about six, I was walking past and he called me over.

""Come look at these pictures!"" Gene said and I cautiously headed over. It was a thick stack of pictures of children - not child porn or anything, but just children at play. Even at six, I thought it was a little strange. Why was an adult showing me pictures of other children? I mentioned it to my parents later and they told me that it was most likely Gene's grandchildren and, being only six, I didn't think much of it.

Fast forward a bit and this is where the story gets really creepy. I avoided Gene as much as I could in this time period and, save for the occasional creepy encounter, it was fine living next door to him. This occurred when I was around 12 and my sister was 19 or so.

My sister developed fairly young and by 19 was extremely curvy (this adds to the creepiness factor in a moment). At 12, I hadn't even really developed yet, I was still a bean pole. On hot summer days, my sister and I liked to play badminton with the sprinklers spraying us in the backyard. Since we were getting wet, we wore our bikinis to play. It was innocent and fun and we played almost daily.

A few days after we played, my sister pulled me aside. ""Gene's in his camper,"" she whispered to me. I looked over. Gene had a massive trailer that was so big, the windows could still probably peek over our fence. Sure enough, the door was shut but the windows to the camper were open and Gene was watching us play badminton in our bikinis.

This occurred almost daily when we were playing. Gene would come out, watch us play in his air-conditioned trailer, and shortly after we went in, he would, too.

Then one day, we were playing, knowing Gene was watching us but somehow hoping we were mistaken, when Gene popped his head up over the fence. My older sister had a heart attack, but cautiously walked over to Gene.

""Is this your birdie?"" Gene asked, holding up a bright purple birdie. ""It came over my fence.""

My sister shook her head. ""That's not our birdie, our birdies are only blue and green,"" she told him. We had bought them in a set, we had no purple birdies.

""Well, I've got a bunch of 'em over here, come get them,"" Gene said. My sister politely declined then told me we were done playing for the day.

My sister and I instantly knew that Gene watched us play then had gone out, purchased a set full of birdies to talk to us and, most likely, lure us over to his house.

After that, we stopped playing badminton.

We later on learned that Gene had kissed one of our neighbors on the mouth right in front of her husband and that Kathryn wasn't his second wife, she was his eighth, and he ended up divorcing Kathryn to marry a woman in her twenties. He moved away from next door and my sister and I have never been so relieved.

1370505146.0	1fs1nk	Stalker poisoned our dog	beachcover	123	12	29	"When I was 11 (I'm female), we lived outside of Charleston, SC in a large house, several acres, nice neighborhood but so much forest and creeks it's almost rural. We had two golden retrievers, Sunny, and her pup we kept from her first litter, Big Mac. We also had my two brothers' wolf/shepherd hybrid dog, Lobo. We love dogs. We also had several ducks, a cat, two horses, and hamsters. We love animals.

We knew all our neighbors next to our house, played with their kids, shared dinners, etc. Our dogs knew all our neighbors too and were friendly. Goldens could only be called ferocious or mildly intimidating if you count licking someone to near death. Ours were no exception. Lobo on the other hand, was intimidating just by his looks. You didn't want to test him if you didn't know him.

One day Mac goes missing. He's only about 8 months old and never left his mom's side. We search all over, finally finding him unconscious across the street in the woods. Rush to the vet and we learn he's been poisoned. Rat poison. Huge amount. More than what an individual rat would consume so it was not likely that Mac had simply eaten a poisoned rat. He recovered much to the vet's surprise but his brain was damaged from having bled so badly. ( In the future, full grown he never developed emotionally or mentally beyond that of his 8 month old puppy self. Sadly sweet to see a 50 pound dog think he's still a lap dog or galumph around like his paws were too big for him.) In the meantime, my brothers find a plastic bag with hamburger in it and white residue mixed in, tossed in our bushes near the road, another in bushes by the driveway.  The next day, there's a new bag tossed on our lawn.  Someone's purposely trying to poison our dogs. We think it's probably meant for Lobo. We report it to the police, who say yup we'll file a report. We have no suspect.

My 17 and 19 year old brothers go into full combat mode. It's the south, in the 1970's, so guns are a given. Out come the hunting rifles and camouflage. They enlist two friends. Our property is at the end of a cul-de-sac, so whoever drives in must exit the same way after following the roundabout. They position themselves strategically in the heavy under brush across from our freestanding basketball hoop along the street under a streetlight. They want the license plate if this guy gets away. They wait all night in sleeping bags. No one comes. My mom is sick with worry and thinks someone's going to get hurt. Bob, my oldest brother, tells her that's the point.

The next night it's the same setup. The neighbors are aware of the plan. They're outraged at what's happened. I want to be there and whine and cry when they say no. It's not safe. But, but, but...They remind me how I was when I went duck-hunting. Oh yeah. No patience and I talk a lot and there's no food. I acquiesce though not very gracefully. The boys are in two separate groups along the road in the shrubs. They have their walkie talkies and strategize. I go in my room to peak out of my blinds and watch from the comfort of my stuffed animals, I try not to doze off. Around 1:00 am, a car with lights off comes rolling quietly down the street. You can hear the individual gravel pieces crush against concrete slowly under tires and then stop. The car idles low in the night, not moving, assessing the situation. It rolls forward once again and a plastic bag hits the grass. The lights are still off. The shadows of the trees hide the car. I am biting my fingernails to nubs, watching this unfold. My bros want it to drive past their first location to see the plates. (They said later, the plates were duct-taped over.) My brother stands up aiming directly at the driver's window. That car takes off with a screech and a roar in reverse all the way back down the street, lights blazing on. The boys chasing after, trying to get the make of the car. It's so dark. Boys are yelling, dogs are barking inside. I'm wishing I had popcorn. Bad guys are gone.

This repeats several nights, my brothers standing guard in the bushes and this dumb-fuck actually comes back two more nights, like it's a challenge. My mom has reported all this to the cops but they only send a patrol once a night through our streets. The cop actually advises my bros to stop antagonizing the car. My bros don't stop. The second time the car came back, they floored it through our round about digging a giant donut in the turf. My brother shot at the tire. More for a warning, he said. Car takes off. My bros report the color and make of the car to police. They make a note. The last night the car came back, it idled far up the street and revved the engine. My brothers stood in the street by our house and held up a gun. The car revved, but then backed up and left. My mom had dialed the police, who came an hour after the car left. And that was it. The car didn't come back again after that. We still had a habit of checking our yard for poison. But they didn't come back. TL;DR: Nobody messes with our dogs."	t5_2t3t8	True
1361239721.0	18shhg	3am Mystery Attack	gonzodie	131	25	23	"It was 2007, I had been living in my first apartment on my own while attending a theater conservatory program in LA.  I lived about two blocks from the school, and for about a year had been living a carefree existence devoted entirely to costuming and theater. 

Sometimes I stayed over at my boyfriend's house, who lived closer to the downtown area. One night we had an argument and about 2 or 3 in the morning I brilliantly decide to drive home because I'd had enough of his bullshit. Only...I didn't have my own parking spot at my place. I had to park in the street, as certain parts of Hollywood just SUCK when it comes to parking. So it's 3 in the morning, I just parked about 2 blocks away from my house and I'm walking back to my apartment laden with bags of my stuff. My phone rings as I'm walking and it's the boyfriend calling to make sure I at least got home alright. Somehow our argument gets re-ignited and I am now obliviously arguing on the phone instead of paying attention to my surroundings.  As I'm yelling on the phone, I suddenly felt the air change. I hadn't heard anyone, I hadn't seen anything, all I know is that I suddenly felt someone behind me. I stopped talking, turned around, and there's someone in a dark hoodie just standing there looking at me. 

It was too dark to tell if it was boy or girl, It was tall-ish, with a slender frame, and It was holding a tire iron. I screamed and dropped my phone, and thats when It started beating the hell out of me with the tire iron. I dropped all my stuff and started screaming for help but the streets were deserted. It went on hitting me for a few minutes and when I fell to the floor It started kind of half-heartedly kicking me.  I'm just lying there panicking, all these thoughts running through my head like why? what did i do? They're not even hitting me that hard, why am I not fighting back? What else are they going to do to me? They finally stopped, dropped the tire iron, and ran to a car that had been waiting on a corner across the street the whole time, about 60 ft away.  I got up and grabbed the tire iron, irrationally chasing after the car as it sped off...They didn't try to rob me or rape me or say anything...they just beat me up for no fucking reason. I stopped to gather all my stuff and my boyfriend called to tell me he was on his way to my house, he said when I had screamed and the phone cut off he felt absolutely sick and started panicking. I had lumps all over my head but wasnt seriously injured.

 For some reason I was more angry than scared and when we talked to the cops they said it sounded like some kind of gang initiation.  When my lease ended about a month later I made sure to move into a building where I'd have my own parking spot. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1349628479.0	113ckx	"""You live around here?"""	gingergypsy	126	15	14	"My first creeper encounter is [here.](http://as.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/112mnv/sure_youre_a_meat_salesman_all_right/)

When I was 16, the freeway by my house was completed, and I took this as a sign from god that I was destined to finally go to the mall on my own.  Now, I had driven up there with friends, but I had never just gone to the mall by myself.  It is 15 miles from where I live, and my mother, being super-protective, had always gone with me if no friends were available.  I never complained, I liked hanging out with my mom, she is fun to be around and she also paid for whatever I bought.

So, with my newfound freedom, and my new car (moms old buick) I decide to go to Barnes and Noble (a large bookstore) near the mall. I lived in suburbia, and the only thing nearby home at the time was a grocery store and a shit ton of cotton farms, so driving to civilization was a true treat.

It typical teenager style, I dressed up. I put on make up, (too much, I'm sure), a short skirt, and heels.  Looking back, I probably looked like a tramp, but when you're young, subtlety is not your strong suit.

I made the 20 minute drive, and hopped out of my car and headed into the store.  As I walked in, I noticed a pick up truck parked out front at the very entrance, in the fire lane. A man is sitting in the drivers seat, dark hair, looked hispanic.  I didn't give it too much thought.  There was also a man leaning against the building, smoking.  He had on a white t-shirt, jeans and a blue baseball cap.  Pretty average looking white guy, maybe in his 30's. I made a mental note that he was there, but disregarded it.  

I was feeling pretty fucking invincible that day, so I strutted my purdy ass in the door and flipped my hair.  Oh, to be young and naive again.

I began perusing the non fiction section, not really looking for anything in particular.  I looked up, and saw the man in the white t-shirt, through the shelves in the other aisle. He was kind of fidgety and nervous. I kept one eye on him as I browsed.

A minute later he came around to my aisle.  He said, ""Um, hey. Do you know where (some random store) is?""

My creeper meter was pinging, so I said no.

He paused a second and kind of looked around. ""So, do you live around here?""

Creeper meter at code orange, I said, ""No, I don't live around here.""

He continued kind of shifting his weight, his eyes darting around. ""I'm lost, could you come outside and show me where the freeway is?""

Now, at this point, creeper meter hits code red, because, you can see the freeway from the entrance.  There is no way that you could miss it.  His questions don't quite make sense, so it becomes apparent he just wants an excuse to approach me.

I tell him I can't help him, and walk away, directly to the check out counter. There is a girl at the register and I tell her, ""Hey, there is some guy approaching customers, he is kinda creeping me out.""

At the same time another employee walks up, a kind of big guy, a few years older than me.  Overhearing me, he says, ""Was he wearing a blue baseball hat?""

I say, ""Yes, he was. How did...""

""Because he just ran out the front door."" With that, he takes off running after the guy.  He comes back in, and says the guy hoped in a pickup truck with another guy and sped off.

Then it hits me.  He had been trying to get me outside, so he could get me in that truck. That is why his questions didn't seem to fit together quite right, and why he was so shifty.

The guy employee walked me to my car, and I headed straight home.  I wondered for a while why the guy had targeted me.  Was it what I was wearing? Was it because I had flipped my hair? In the end it doesn't really matter.  He was looking for an easy mark, and he thought I fit the bill. It was a while before I felt comfortable going out by myself after that, and even worse when I had another encounter after this one.

This is something that I had forgotten all about but through reading some of these stories I got reminded of it. Its not terribly bad...but it still creeps me out when I think about it, what could have happened to me. So I may have been like 8 or 9 years old, walking around in Kroger. It was a smallish town at the time so there was really no apparent danger in me walking to the magazine aisle or anywhere. I had to go to the bathroom so I walked over to it. These were the one person sized bathrooms at the time, the kind with the lock on it. So I knocked on the door, no answer. One more knock just to be sure, no answer. I opened it up and there was a man standing inside so I did what any little kid with manners did. ""oh sorry, I didn't hear you say anything"" and started to close the door. The man comes back with ""oh it's okay i'm almost done you can come in here and wait."" heck no...no no no. I backed away and let the door close and waited against the wall. Not 5 seconds later he opens the door and pokes his head out with a creepy smile that gave nicholson a run for his money and said to me ""really...its okay, come on in here."" needless to say I decided that I didn't really have to go anymore so I went and found my mom and dad. I don't know what would have happened if I wen't in there, ~~Maybe he was just being friendly, maybe a pedo, but~~ to this day even as an adult I still triple check to make sure no one is in the bathroom when I knock. 


EDIT:// okay holy crap people...thank you for pointing out my poor choice of words with ""friendly"" now let it die. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1340536364.0	viry9	My train stalker.	lovepenguin9	129	19	15	"I have been an avid reader on reddit for about a year now (thanks to my bf showing me) but this is the first time i've posted, only because I want to let reddit know about one of my many creeper experiences. 

(FYI- I'm a petite blonde female living in WA Australia) 
I was 18 at the time and had not got my license yet so everyday I would have to catch a bus, a train then another bus to work, and the same on the way back from work.
I was waiting at the bus stop at the train station before work one morning and a tall guy with glasses came and sat next to me, he looked about 30. 
It's illegal to smoke at the train station but I saw the guy get out a pack of cigs and light up, he offered me one and the ciggie fiend I am said yes (frankly I was dying for a cig before work). 
He told me his name was Dave and sat next to me when the bus came. We talked in a friendly manner and I discovered we caught the same bus and train to and from work.  
So nearly every morning I would arrive at the train station and he would be there waiting for me, often buying me cokes from the cafe. 
This went on for 2 weeks until one day he rocked up at the train station in a car and offered me a lift to work instead, I accepted (god knows why!)He spent most of the car ride telling me about how he is great at making girls orgasm. As soon we got to my work he insisted I give him a hug, which lasted for about a minute while he breathed deeply into my neck, later that day he came into my work around lunch time to (see how I was) then literally bolting out the store when my boss showed up. This is when I thought, this guy is actually a fucking weirdo.

I told my mate about him and she insisted that she take me to work for the next week. About a week and a half later (I had not seen him at the station at all this week) I hopped onto the train, it was dark outside and the train was empty, he came in holding a laptop he usually carries. He immediately sat right next to me, I just tried to be distant but friendly knowing my stop is before his one, as it came to my stop he stood up got off the train with me.
Me: 'Um don't you get off at wellard station?'
Dave: 'Nah i'm meeting a mate today at that pub you told me about'

My stop is the one before the pub, so I knew he wouldn't get off at my stop unless he wanted to walk for 20 mins. It was at this point he opened his laptop and proceeded to show me pictures of me on his laptop (probably stolen from my facebook) and tells me he had done (and I quote) 'unforgivable' things looking at them while staring at my face to see my reaction. I could only reply with ':0...eew! wtf dave?' 

He then got on my bus, All I wanted to do was get home, as the bus finally arrived at my stop I jumped off and started power walking.
'HEY!', I turn round and see him walking towards me. 
At this point i'm freaking the fuck out. I try put on a brave face and say 
'why did you get off at this stop? I told you the next stop will take you to the pub'. He just starts walking next to me mumbling an answer. I can see my house at this point but don't want him to know where I live so I just say 'my house is down this road' (points to random road)
He then asked if he could come see my house, I said I was busy and
power walked down the street phone in hand, 000 already dialled into the keypad. I could hear him yelling for me to give him a hug ,over and over. I just started jogging and took a short cut though some bushes to get home never looking back.

That was the last time I caught the train from work.

1338921770.0	umhey	"""Alex"""	melodybelody	129	24	23	"It was the end of a weird and wild party in Boston. I was at this girl's house, ready to fall asleep on her sofa, using some guys jacket as a blanket. It was a bad idea to go to this party in the first place, and especially to get as intoxicated as I did. 


Anyways. I'm on this sofa, when I hear a lot of clattering and drunk talking. Sitting up, I see this tall, bearded guy in the archway. He's looking right fucking at me and saying things like ""I'm so depressed. I want to end my life. God, you're so beautiful. Why are you so pretty? I hate my life. I hate being homeless. I hate being poor. You're so cute. Can't we cuddle?"" 

Clearly this guy is extremely drunk, definitely homeless, and I have NO idea how he got into the apartment. I slowly reach down to my purse alongside the couch. Digging around my purse, I start to tell the guy, ""It's okay. Living's better than nothing... Why don't you go over to that couch"" I point into the other room so he knows what couch, ""and lie down? You'll feel better soon?"" 

Meanwhile, as I'm saying this, I'm grabbing hold of a canister of MACE in my purse. I sneak the mace under my pillow and hold it tight. I'm literally terrified of this guy. I have this overwhelming sensation that he's dangerous, and if I move from this couch, he'll strike out. 


He's still standing there, swaying in the archway... and he doesn't take my couch advice. Instead he comes over to me and sits ON my legs on MY couch. I tell him ""Ow, get off! There's no room!"" and he tries to cuddle with me, falling over my body and mumbling about how depressed he is. I'm extremely tempted to use the mace at this time, but push him back instead, afraid he would get angry and knock me out if I sprayed him. I'm a tiny girl, and this guy was well over 6 feet tall. 


I make sure to tell him, ""NO. You cannot come on THIS couch."" He looks at me, his eyes full of tears, his breath reeking of rotten wine and old beer. He reaches his hand out to my face (now I'm REALLY about to mace the shit out of this guy) before he falls onto the ground and starts BAWLING his eyes out.


Now I'm freaking. I'm alone downstairs. Everyone else is passed the fuck out upstairs, and I'm stuck with a strange, crying, piss-drunk homeless man trying to get with me. I tell the guy to calm down and put my head on my pillow so he thinks I'm going to sleep... but really I'm just discreetly clutching my mace. 


He cries and cries, still asking me if he can just come up to ""cuddle his sadness away."" Eventually he cries himself to sleep on the floor by my couch... but I'm wide awake all night. Hours and hours later, the guy gets up and stumbles out the front door into early daylight. I immediately leave once he is gone. 

When I asked my friend who lived in the house about a ""sad, drunk, homeless guy"" she said his name is Alex and he just lost his job and apartment. He's been showing up at their house for weeks, looking for food and alcohol (which they give to him). I told her she's fucking insane to let this guy wander into her house at all hours of the night. I haven't talked to the girl since, nor have I seen ""Alex."" Creepiest experience of my life. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1376408608.0	1ka7gu	Curtains, always a good idea.	Le_Curieux	130	21	37	"Let me preface this by saying I do not live in a safe neighborhood. It's not the most dangerous neighborhood, but we have our thieves and crackheads and bums like any other inner-city neighborhood. I've had a few scary encounters before, but nothing quite like this.


One night I'm sitting in my living room, on my computer, while my boyfriend is asleep on the couch right next to me. I live in an older ""shotgun"" style house with an abandoned house on one side of me and a working class family on the other. There is a window in my living room that faces the abandoned house and it's at the same level as someone's head when sitting down. It's located over the right shoulder of my comfiest chair and since it's not visible from the street, we never bothered to put up a curtain to cover it. 

So I'm lounging in my favorite chair, browsing reddit, half watching whatever it was my boyfriend fell asleep to. I'm very used to friends coming by at all hours of the night, using my porch when I'm away or asleep, locking up their bikes/mopeds in my backyard etc. So when I saw, out of the corner of my eye, someone walk past this window, I didn't think much of it. When it happened again, I got a creepy feeling and actually looked out the window, I didn't see anyone or any new bikes chained up in my backyard. I was pretty unsettled, but I shrugged it off and went back to my redditing. 

I was reading a pretty enthralling story, probably an SCP (LOVE the SCP series) or something from /r/creepy[1] , when I get start to get this chill in the top of my spine. It was a slow onset, and by the time I realized it wasn't the story giving me the chills but something else, a few minutes had gone by. My first instinct is to not move, so I sit there and pretend to keep reading, but in actuality, I'm petrified. I could feel that something was in the window, and I knew the window was less than a foot from my head. After a few seconds that felt like days, I turn to look. 

Staring me in the face is a white male with glasses and a black hood, a complete stranger. We stare at each other for a second until I regain control of my body and scream while violently shaking my boyfriend awake. This is enough to send the creeper running toward our back alley. Of course my half-awake boyfriend takes off after him with a knife, but to no avail.


To this day, I don't know if this guy was casing our house, casing me, or what, but whatever the reason, he was outside my house, staring at me through a window less than a foot away from my head. Sufficed to say, we keep that window covered now."	t5_2t3t8	True
1374074882.0	1iho4e	The man outside my school	ARandomAsianGirl	137	27	17	"When I went to elementary school, there was always this old, seemingly harmless man outside the gate with his furry little dog.
Years later I finally understood why he always brought his dog to the school &amp; that was his route.
This old man would usually strike up random conversations with the children (only) and would ask ""innocent"" questions.
I was/am a sucker for animals so I never missed any of his visits to the school. (I was allowed to pet the dog, a cute, small Maltese breed with the most cheerful personality I'd ever come by.)
He started asking me very personal questions like ""where do you live?"", ""what's your phone number?"" Etc.
And don't misunderstand, I have two VERY protective parents so I know the rules and go by them Til this day, but when I was a kid I was taught to always include people. 
And I saw this old man as my friend so I answered his questions.
This old man started asking me more personal and sexual questions than before. ""Have you ever seen a penis"" and he once even asked me if he could see my ""hoo-haw"". 
Ok, so I knew where the line goes, so I stopped talking to him.
The next few months were full of phone calls where no one would talk, only heavy breathing and groans.
He would try to catch me on my way home, but I always ran away from him. (My parents started picking me up after school
After an incident I will write shortly and they both would always answer the phone.)
Now here's the creepiest part, he once tried to pick me off from school.
Because the school had never actually seen/bothered to remember my parents faces, they didn't detect the danger at the spot.
They ALMOST let me leave with this very dangerous man despite my numerous calls for help, but the one who saved me from a cruel fate was my older brother, he saw me and the old man and didn't wait a second to part him from me and shouting for the teacher to come.
The man had already ran away by now so they couldn't catch him.
I didn't know what happened to him until I was encouraged to do so out of curiousity.
He was convicted of (many) sexual assaults that traced back to his young self. (Sex with a minor) 
He was also convicted because of his connection to child pornography.
I was one lucky gal. (Thanks bro!)

1364921096.0	1bivti	Larry	Chelslaw	132	22	10	"Hi guys. This is my first post to LetsNotMeet, and it's long. It covers about 8 years of my interactions with Larry, so I apologize for it's length. 

My first memory of Larry is fairly hazy. I was around 3 or 4 at the time and Larry was 20 or 22. My mother had just started taking me and my younger sister to a new church about 45 minutes away from our home. I remember being picked up from behind and swung around someones head, and being taken from this person by my mother. She took me aside and said ""don't let that man touch you, OK?"" I had no idea what she meant at the time, but I was careful not to be without my mom while we were at church.

Larry and my mom became friends through the years after this, and he would buy candy from the store down the street before the sermon started and give it to me and my sister. Obviously, this was pretty exciting for a young kid; free candy, right? I remember being disappointed when he didn't have any to give to us. Larry became a friend, a nice guy in my young mind. I forgot about the warning my mother gave me, and she seemed OK with him giving us candy and such. It was when his car broke down, and we started giving him rides to and from church was when the red flags started for me.

Larry lived at the half-way point of our commute to church, and we had to get off the high-way to get into the town he lived in. He would call my mother in the morning before we left to tell her if he was coming that day or not. 

When he got in our car, he would sit next to me and complement me on what I was wearing or how my hair looked and how much I looked like my mother. He would touch my shoulder or my knee and tell me that I'd grow up to look just like her. Whenever he would do this I got a panicky feeling in my gut. It would make me so uncomfortable and I couldn't say why. It was his whole posture and the way he said certain things about my appearance that really bothered me. 
But it was the things he'd say when my mother wasn't around that made me constantly wary and alert around him.

He would tell me that I'd need to start wearing a bra in a few years, and how all the boys at my school must have crushes on me. During all this he would constantly tell me how pretty I was and touch me on the arm or head. He had no interest in my sister at this time, he never said anything like that about her. 

I began to avoid him. I was about 8 I think when I realized that the things he said to me were not appropriate for a 25 year old man to say to an 8 year old girl. I was afraid to tell my mother about how uneasy he made me, because I felt that she wouldn't believe me. They were friends after all, and we gave him rides and such. He even when with us to visit my great-grandmother sometimes, who lived just outside of the town. We would visit her after church, when Larry couldn't come that week, but he insisted he didn't mind sticking around town for a few hours. 

It got worse at my grandmothers house. My mother and her would be talking in the kitchen while my sister and I would play in the living room. Larry would follow us sometimes, to ""keep and eye on us."" My sister and I would usually stop our games when he came into the room. She would feel uncomfortable and leave to go be with mom, and I would be left alone with Larry. He would start telling me intimate details about his relationships with other girls, how often they would kiss and the sexy clothes they would wear. He would usually sit next to me on the couch, or block the doorway to the hall and I would have to force my way around him to get back to my mother. 

I would feel sick to my stomach whenever we pulled off the high-way to head into his town. I would fight my sister for the front seat every morning. When he got in I was cold and unresponsive. I thought that if I was rude and unfriendly he would leave me alone. He would call me out in it when we were alone, and ask why I didn't want to be his friend anymore. 

Things finally came to a head when my great-grandmother died. We went to her house after church a week after the funeral to pick something of hers as a memento. For some reason I still don't understand, Larry came with us. Most of my moms side of the family was there, about 5 other people not including us. They were talking in the living room and looking over old photos. My aunt had brought her dog with her, and I was petting it on the floor in the kitchen. Larry came in, grabbed a chair placed in front of me and straddled it. If I wanted to get up, I would have to step over his knees; he had me in the corner, between the door to the backyard and the wall. 

He started talking about this girl he liked, but she wasn't interested in him. He seemed really upset about it and kept asking my opinion on what I think he should do. My response to everything he asked was ""I don't know.."" I felt really scared and trapped. I didn't know what was happening or what he would do. I started to tear up and told him that ""maybe you should just leave her alone..""
He stopped talking and just looked at me. It was quiet for a few minutes before I worked up the nerve to get up and move around him. I had the dog by his collar and put him between Larry and myself. He never said a word, he just stared at me as I left the room. I let go of the dog and went to the living room to be with my mom.

After we had dropped Larry off that night, I started to cry. I told my mom how I felt when I was around him, all the things he would say and how he behaved when we were alone. My mother was shocked, but she believed me. She told me that she'd keep more of an eye on me and that she'd never let me be alone with him again. She told me to just not talk to him at all. The only problem was that she continued to give him rides. It took me about a year after this to stop going to church all together. My sister did the same soon after, because he started turning his attentions to her. 

The last I heard of Larry, he wasn't allowed to be near kids or school grounds. Apparently he grabbed the clasp of a 12 year old girls bra and unhooked it. Her parents took him to court."	t5_2t3t8	True
1355272688.0	14p2qi	Dodgy Online Dating Stories, anyone?	walnutwhale	149	41	50	" Backstory: I used to do a lot of online dating because the city where I live is very hard to meet people in (everyone kind of keeps to themselves). I met this particular champ on OKCupid.

____

I guess you could say I go for a certain kind of guy: Tall, handsome, well dressed, driven, intellectual, with a touch of hipster and geek thrown in there. I guess you could say I have high standards. Therefore, I spent a lot of time ""screening"" potential dates with extended messages. chatting or texting before we met in person. I like to believe that because I basically raised myself on the internet, I have a good sixth sense for creeps and weirdos. I call it my FIF: Funny Inner Feeling.

George was everything I seemed to be looking for: he rocked a pompadour and a six o'clock shadow with the ease of Ryan Gosling. His profile was rife with eloquent language, and his messages to me were flowery and deep. We touched upon philosophy, literature, and fantastic music and I was quickly smitten. We started texting, and our texts were similarly full of excellent vocabulary and unique conversation topics.

One chilly fall night I went out with some of my friends to an independent hip hop night and I drank more whiskey sours than I care to admit. While sober walnutwhale may not have been so reckless, tipsy walnutwhale felt like texting George at 1am asking him if he wanted to meet up for pizza felt like a good idea. After all, spontaneity generally leads to good things and excellent adventures, right? 

I walked into the pizza place and saw George sitting amidst all the empty tables, awaiting me. He was even more beautiful than in his photographs, and my heart skipped a beat. Our conversation rambled and weaved itself for hours - we had an excellent rapport and I felt entirely at ease with this man. That's when at around 5am he offered to take me to his house to watch a movie he had made I was not alarmed. However, I very firmly told him I would be happy to accompany him home, but I was not the sort of woman who fucks on the first date. With a smile that dented his dimples, he told me he respected that and linked his hand with mine.

We practically skipped to his home, still babbling wildly at one another. I was so full of excitement - I felt that we had a real, tangible connection. When we reached his abode, I became even more impressed: he lived in the basement of a massive old mansion. He had five roommates, all women and all professional artists. As we tiptoed downstairs to his lair, I was assaulted on all sides by good taste - and that only continued as we hit his ""cave"". Full to the brim of awesome art and interesting artifacts, I found myself even more fascinated with him.

We both curled up on his bed, comfortably enjoying one another's company as he queued up the student film he had made a few years prior. It was some sort of 3D mess of colors and lines set to Brian Eno, but truth be told we weren't paying much attention to it. George stared at me, and then he went in for the first kiss.

And when he pulled away, he had changed. His mellow, happy attitude had intensified - but not in a sexy way. His eyes had turned stoney, his features had sharpened, and his grip on me tightened. 

""I'm James Bond, you know.""

I giggled nervously; suddenly all my alarm bells were going off at once. ""I'm sorry, I've never seen the movies.""

His eyes narrowed as he regarded me. ""What I'm saying is - don't get too close. Don't get close at all.""

What? We had been having such a great time. I was incredibly confused with this sudden Jekyll and Hyde personality switch. 

""Let's uh... watch your movie."" Attempting to back out of the situation gracefully and thinking perhaps he just showed nervousness strangely, I inched slightly away from him and leaned back, trying to appear nonchalant as I fixed my eyes to the TV screen. In reality, I was on alert, every nerve in my body ready for flight. I'm a big girl: not fat, just tall and Amazonian. George was about the same height and build as me, and I knew I could probably take him if something happened, but I wanted to tactfully extract myself from the situation before that happened.

Backing off seemed like the wrong thing to do. I felt George tense beside me before he jumped on top of me, trying to force his hand up my shirt. 

""George!!"" I protested past his reaching tongue. ""I told you: I'm not going to fuck on the first date!""

My heart was beating a drumline in my chest. I didn't want to become violent in case something even worse happened, but I was pushing him off of me as intensely as I dared.

""THEN WHY THE FUCK DID YOU COME OVER TO MY HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT?! I TOLD YOU, I'M JAMES BOND!!""

As he bellowed in my face, I shoved him off of me and stood up all in one quick motion. As I snatched up my purse and charging phone as quickly as possible, his demeanor softened again.

""Look, walnutwhale, I'm sorry. I can't... I just... my ex girlfriend, she really fucked me over, y'know? I'm broken. I can't... I can't love."" He opened his arms, trying to get me to come to him again.

Something deep within me twinged, some inkling of compassion for this suddenly broken man in front of me, but I knew it was a ploy. I buttoned up my jacket and shoved on my hat. ""I need to go home.""

Again, his expression changed. He set his jaw and a flash of hatred passed his visage. ""Fine. Fucking fine. I'll walk you out.""

""No, that's okay-"" I protested.

""NO, I said I am going to WALK YOU OUT.""

Meekly, I nodded. I made a beeline to the basement door, fumbling with the lock until I was free into glorious frigid early morning sunshine. My breath fogging in front of me, George followed me like a kicked puppy.

At the gate, I paused to say goodbye to him, full of confusion and regret. He stared at me, the man I had met earlier that night, all gentleness and handsome aloofness. Then he grabbed both of my arms in a vice grip and attempted to kiss me. I turned my face sideways and he collided with my cheek, and his fingers tightened around my arms so hard that I had bruises the next day.

""George, you're hurting me. George, I need to catch my bus.""

Wordlessly, he released me and stonily watched me walk away until I rounded the corner. I haven't heard from him since then, but I have seen him at the bars and he is always laughing and looking perfectly normal and approachable."	t5_2t3t8	True

I used to live in a relatively quiet suburb when I was 15 years old, home alone, when a man that I have never met, or seen before was knocking on my door. We had windows on either side of the door that I peered out of. Thats when he saw me, and proceeded to shout ""I need something to drink. water, anything, please, help me"" He was pulling on the door handle violently. I didn't know what to do, do I open the door? Call the police? I wound up calling my dad who instructed me to retrieve the (unloaded) shotgun from the gun case. I went back to the window, and he was gone.

1328995029.0	pl6jq	Stalked by [MY] Coworker	Laleiden	132	23	12	"This is an encounter I had with a coworker of mine autumn of last year. 

I am a young woman, only 19-years-old. I've worked for three years at a restaurant that is locally owned and operated in the Cincinnati tri-state area. About two years ago, a young man named Jeff was hired to work back-of-house at my place of employment. He seemed like a nice enough guy, but it was easy to tell that he was a bit... off.

At the time, I spent many of my working hours in the kitchen as well. I didn't really dwell from that one central location, and I worked many hours on-shift with Jeff. We spoke often and I learned a lot about him. He told me how his dream was to be a firefighter, and all about his fascination with laser pointers and listening to the local police with his radio scanner, which he always had on him. 

After a while, Jeff became extremely needy of social contact. Especially with me, it seemed. He would text me in the wee hours of the night, and he would continue to send me texts even if I didn't respond. These texts came every night, and typically I would ignore them. I would just talk to him like nothing had happened the next day at work. He never made a big deal about it and neither did I.

I had found out from a coworker of mine that Jeff had been in a sports accident when he was a young child, and as a result suffered irreparable brain damage which caused him to act out. Because of that, I allowed my sympathy for him to cloud my judgement. I was letting him get a little too close.

He began confiding secrets in me that I couldn't even have fathomed about him. His wanted to become a woman, the fact that he has been taking breast pills, etc. He even began sending picture messages to my phone of him in a bra and women's clothing. I didn't know whether this desire to be a woman stemmed from the brain damage he sustained as a child, or whether that was simply a personal decision of his. Regardless, I was getting creeped out. However, my sympathy for him outweighed the icky feeling in the pit of my stomach.

I was also told that he suffered from some sort of psychotic disorder, and because of this and a variety of other social and judicial reasons, he had spent quite a bit of time in a home for disturbed or criminal boys.

Eventually, he began asking me to hang out with him at his house, at my house, and that is where I drew the line. I wanted to keep our 'friendship' within the safe confines of work. So, I made excuses to not see him. I started telling him that I was too busy with school, that I was working a lot more than I actually was. I thought after the first week or two he would back off like any normal person would, but the requests continued for months.

One Friday night, after a particularly rigorous dinner rush and after-hours clean up where Jeff and I closed the kitchen together, I was beat and relieved to go home. So I climbed into my old beat-up Saturn and turned to leave the parking lot. With Jeff right on my heels. It seemed like no big deal to me, as we would both be going the same way for a few minutes. 

I knew something wasn't right when he turned on his turn signal behind me, signaling that he was going the same way as me. I thought, that can't be right, and just continued on my way, figuring he would turn in the opposite direction at the next intersection. I was wrong. He was following me, and I had to think quick to lose him. We were heading up the hill, Jeff trailing ever so slightly behind me. The hill was winding, so you could easily lose sight of the person behind you if you weren't careful (or you tried hard enough). So just as I was about to wind the final curve, I flashed my right turn signal (even though I would be continuing forward), and sighed as I saw him turn onto the road as I had hoped. I sped up and eventually he was out of sight.

When I got home, I locked the doors and ran upstairs and laid in bed. I felt scared, and I felt like my privacy had been violated by someone whose mental and emotional stability was highly questionable.

I never said anything to anyone until one of my other coworkers, named Bobby, started telling me about how Jeff had mentioned following his female friend home to find out where she lived. I was shocked that Jeff had not only admitted to doing it, but also felt like it was completely normal.

1376363251.0	1k959c	So Glad I Had That Knife	unreal-ity	130	22	39	"After finishing my freshman year of college a few months ago, I came home for the summer. A little background: I'm a 19 year old girl from a very safe suburb. My neighborhood doesn't even have streetlights, and our police force is confined to dealing mostly with off-leash dogs and cranky old ladies. I haven't encountered very many creeps, but the college town next to my university is populated with enough weirdos to prompt my dad to buy me a smallish (2.5 inch locking blade) pocket knife. We laughingly picked it out together as somewhat of a joke, in fact it's even my girly favorite color purple. We both figured I would probably never need to use it, but it would definitely make me feel safer walking alone at night. I planned to take it with me back down to school in August.

Anyways, I kept the knife in my purse and besides playing around with it enough to be able to open &amp; close it with one hand, I barely touched it for weeks.

Flash forward a little bit and I'm in my car after dark around 11pm headed to pick up my boyfriend from his job at a coffee shop. He works in a small, corner shopping plaza right off one of the main drags in my town. He often worked the closing shift that month and I would pick him up, so this had become sort of a familiar thing. 

Anyways, I pull into a spot near the coffee shop (but not quite right out front) and  strangely enough there's a car parked close by, facing me, with a man sitting in the drivers seat. And I notice he's looking right at me. He has crazy eyes, leathery, wrinkled skin, and dark hair. I figure he's probably picking somebody up from work like I am, but I just got a weird feeling about him that I couldn't shake. I figured that it was just me being paranoid or having an over-active imagination, so I tried to forget about it and turned my attention to my phone. But every time I glanced up, he was still staring right at me. This continued for about ten or fifteen minutes, and I was getting increasingly freaked out.

At this point we're the only two people in the parking lot. Any stragglers or other cars have vanished. I look in my rearview mirror to see the coffee shop entrance and I see my boyfriend. Wave of relief. I can also see a few of his coworkers leaving and it seems like he's the last one inside. I think 'ok good...he must be almost done and then we can get the fuck out of here and laugh about this'

But here's where it gets scary:

I take my eyes off the rearview mirror to check the car with the sketchy guy in it. But there's no one in the car. Full-on panic mode. I scan around frantically trying to see where he went, and I spot him WALKING TOWARDS MY CAR. I lock the doors, put the key in the ignition, and make a show of taking my knife out. In the back of my head there's still a voice saying ""you're overreacting, he's probably just lost or something, there must be a reasonable explanation why he's coming over here"". That voice quickly shut up when he knocked on my window.

""Hey, I need help. You help me. Get out of car."" the man said in broken english. At this point I'm having a major deer-in-headlights moment, but something inside me still yells ""FUCK OFF"" as scarily as I could manage.
He gets angry and pounds on my door, then stars peering in my car looking for a way in. I bring the knife closer to the window where he can see it better and once he realizes what it is he starts to back off. He glares at me and yells something I can't understand, then goes back in his car. Still staring at me, he turns on the car and circles the parking lot twice, then he seemed to have left and gone out the exit (my view of the exit was obstructed by the coffee shop).

I finally exhaled. I don't know why I didn't drive to the police station down the road, but I think I was in a little bit of shock. FINALLY my boyfriend appears with coffee in hand. 

""Hey hun. Why's your knife out?"" He asks me. I explain the whole situation, he seems visibly angry and upset. But I'm fine, just a little shook up, and I start the car and head out towards the exit

Only to have the creepy guy, who was waiting in the concealed, dark area near the exit pull his car out and BLOCK ME IN. He stares right at me, I'm shaking, yelling ""That's him! That's the guy!"". This creep notices a guy with me in the car (My boyfriend's a big metalhead, and scary enough for this guy I guess) and the creep takes off before my boyfriend can get out of the car. I'm crying at this point and my boyfriend drove me home. Luckily didn't have to sleep alone that night.

In the morning I told my dad what happened, and he also seemed upset and distressed. 
""I bet you're glad you bought me that knife, huh?"" I asked him over breakfast.
""Maybe we should go check out some purple guns."" He said, half-joking

1367771730.0	1dqjt7	The old man and his truck.	trainsounds	124	19	8	"(I may have posted this somewhere else before, but I don't think I've ever posted it here.)

So when I was a kid, the only way to deal with the summer heat without biking all the way to the pool was going to the river. Me and about five other friends (all girls, around 8 years old at the time this happened) would bike over to the park, which had a road winding through it, and hang out in the river, which was right next to the road.

So a few days before this incident, an old man had taken to parking his red pickup on the road and he'd pretend to sleep, while watching us. It made us all creeped out, because we'd have to go around him to get our bikes and leave, and we decided to leave in pairs and all at once, so he couldn't follow us all. The first pair to leave were asked ""hey, want a ride? Come on, get in."" when they got on their bikes. The rest of us glared at him as we got out, and he just smiled.

So anyways, we decided not to tell our parents about this, but we did tell all our friends, so we could all keep an eye out for him. One of the girls told her mum, who said that she would only be comfortable letting us go back if we had her keeping an eye on us. So, whatever.

She sat in her car, closer to the trees, reading a book. For a while, the old man didn't show. Then, he parked in the exact same spot. S's, mum got out of her car and asked him to please move, he stared at her for a minute before driving away.

Even after he left, we all felt pretty uncomfortable, and I decided to leave. I got on my bike, and I remember looking at the road as it went into the trees, and thinking ""What if he's right around the corner?""

I told S that, and her mum offered to drive behind me until we were out of the park. I accepted, and we started heading out, me about 15 metres in front of her.

Lo and behold, as we rounded a corner into a sheltered picnic area, his truck was right there, with him wide awake and grinning like mad- until the car behind me showed up. When it did, he pretty much deflated, and fell back to his ""old man asleep"" pose.

I really don't want to know what would have happened if I had left alone."	t5_2t3t8	True
1355322592.0	14q542	From embarrassed to scared	ya_tu_sabes	138	31	24	"Female, 16 at the time, tiny frame, 5 ft 2, barely 90 pounds, baby face makes me look 12.... 

At the time, I was at the cadets. I’d go there right after high school as I lived 45-60 min away. So from 6:00PM – 9:00PM, I’d be at the cadets and I’d get home at around 10:00PM wearing the standard army cadet uniform, coat, gloves and beret. You get the idea! My home is a street away from the bus so I had always felt relatively safe going home that late. This is my itinerary home: cross the street twice to get to opposing corner, walk down until the first intersection, turn right and my home is the 5th one to my right. See? Real close, familiar neighborhood, not much to be worried about! There are two unsuccessful clubs right in front of the bus stop. I say unsuccessful because this place has changed vocations so many times in so little time. Cafe, restaurant, club, lounge... Nothing lasts in there but there’s always someone trying. I've never had any problem with the people that go there as it is a friendly neighborhood so even then I wasn't worried. There is a pharmacy right next the those two lounge clubs and a large parking lot which I can go across to go home. To add to the context, note this happened in the middle of winter in Canada, where it’s dark outside after 5:00PM so by 10:00PM, it might as well be in the middle of the night... 

So I got off the bus and wanted to go to bed early. I always carry a small travel toothbrush and tiny travel toothpaste tub with me so I decided I would brush my teeth during my 5 min walk home and save those minutes for extra sleep! I hid my toothbrush handle in my hand so it would look like I was eating a lollypop and cheerfully walked home, very content with my genius idea. So I had only crossed the street once when I see a car driving off the parking lot of the club. The parking lot is right in front of the club facing the street, right across the bus stop so I was very visible. Nothing unusual here so I keep an eye on it as I am wary of my surroundings by habit and was self conscious because of what I was doing. I mean who the hell brushes their teeth while walking outside. I saw the car leave so I kept walking while humming to myself and secretly brushing my teeth. 

I’ve still only crossed the street once at this point. The car has made a U turn and is now slowing down right by my side. Unexpected. Shit, he’s rolling down his window to talk to me. It’s a guy in his early twenties, handsome, well groomed and fit. He’s not wearing his winter coat in his car – only a classy shirt so I noticed. He asks for directions. I have a freaking toothbrush in my mouth! Shit. Shit! I panic slightly. I can’t very well spit out right in front of someone. I close my eyes and force myself to swallow. Dear God, this is embarrassing. I subtly remove the toothbrush and hide it in my pocket, careful not to have it touch the fabric inside. I finally answer his question and start walking again. He keeps up with me and starts asking questions. “Do you live far?” Nah, I live real close by. “Do you want a ride?” I politely decline starting to get wary by now. “You don’t have to be wary of me, I’m not dangerous.” To be honest, if I had been stupid I would have said yes. The guy is handsome. He is friendly. He doesn't give a creep vibe at all, the kind of guy you want to trust. He obviously has money. He has a nice car, the kind you just want to sit in to feel the rich interior. It is winter and cold outside. The roads are frozen and it’s a bit difficult to walk – you have to be careful not to slip on the ice. I am an insecure scrawny teen who looks like a kid and I am getting this sort of attention from this kind of guy? Sweet! Warning – that’s the thing: I look like a fucking kid. Why is this guy insisting on having me get in his car? 

I’m starting to get nervous and am making up excuses. He offers to have some fun at his place (I only now realize this didn’t mean playing video games - I was pretty innocent for a 16 year old...) but I decline saying my mom is waiting for me. (Half lie. She won’t go to sleep without me in the house but know I sometimes miss my bus and have to catch the later bus – an hour later). He offers a ride again. I tell him it’s not in his way. (When he asked for directions, he asked for the bridge which is where I just came from.) He says it’s no problem at all and insists. I start freaking out at this point and decide I’ve been polite enough and bolt out of there. I speed walk through the pharmacy’s parking lot: he can’t follow me past the parking lot, there are cement blocks to stop cars from getting out that particular way. He follows me and tries to keep talking to me. I ignore him and keep rushing, toothbrush long forgotten in my pocket. He follows me until he can’t then speeds back to the street and tries getting to me on the other side by going around the block. I don’t fully come out of the parking lot and hide in the shadows of a building. I see him look for me, give up and speed the hell out in the opposite direction he had originally inquired about. 

That night, I decided to get start bringing the knife I use in cadet expeditions with me every time I had to go home late. Years later, when I finally got a cellphone, I kept that story close to mind and would pre-dial 911 just in case and keep my knife nearby. I never had to use either one, thankfully. I can’t help but wonder what his intentions were. Rape? Kidnapping? Am I being paranoid? Probably not... 

**Note**: I am not advising to bring knives with you. Actually, I had to stop bringing it with me because as my boyfriend pointed out, it is illegal and I would get in heaps of trouble for having it on me (though I’m not worried about being searched by the police. I am a cute tiny piece of a woman, not at all what you would consider suspicious or police search-worthy). Also, it could be used against me if I did come into a situation where defense was needed (hey I’m tiny and not all that strong.)

1353609297.0	13mp3y	I Dated a...Predator?	Elizabish	170	61	61	"Age when it began: 14
I am a female.

I've never been very good at making friends and having developed several destructive habits at an early age along with being diagnosed with several mental disorders and given a variety of cocktails to help me be ""normal""... My childhood was anything but ""nice"". From middle school through almost all of high school except the very end of it, I have blocked out subconsciously. According to my mother, it is probably best that it ALL stays blocked out. (Not just because of what people did to me, but because of how I behaved and the actions I took. I can explain more in comments if you're curious.)
Also, I would like to note that I am a Psychology major, so understanding everything about the human brain is fascinating to me (also because who better than to help people with mental disorders than someone who has experience(d) them). I'm rambling.

In middle school I was in a rough crowd and was spiraling out of control, never touched drugs or alcohol though. It was more of my mental stability. As a consequence, my parents elected to send me to a private Catholic school because they believed a more structured environment would help me.

It's safe to say they were wrong about it in two different ways: one was that my mental state continued to decline to where the voices in my head were now manifesting into shapes and people, they were becoming real and I talked about them like they were real. And two, I met Jerry.

Jerry was one of those guys who was a complete sweetheart and he was incredibly charming. Jerry was also a senior and 18 years old. He was sly and devious much like Ted Bundy. At 14 I was still incredibly under developed and I was very thin. I looked even younger than I was (I'm almost 21 and I still look like I'm 16), but I thought he was into me because I was ""different"" ""beautiful"" ""insert overly exaggerated adjective here that would make a young innocent (and lonely) girl feel wanted"". 

You see, no one had ever really called me beautiful before. Don't get me wrong... I got hit on, but I usually sent them right back to where they came from because being a bitch was a natural defense mechanism and because I was always the ""hot crazy unstable chick"". Not the beautiful one. 

So, I didn't have any friends and I was (and still am) socially awkward and here he was paying all this attention to me. Within a couple weeks we were dating and everything got out of control before I could even say, ""no"". He was my first boyfriend and I wanted to make him happy, so when he touched me in places I truly didn't want to be touched, I just went to a happy place in my mind much like I did when I went through a very traumatic experience of being violated when I was in middle school. (I can post that story on here as well, but it will take some time because it honestly still traumatizes me and, hell... my hands are trembling and getting all clammy just trying to think about it).

I never said ""No"" out loud, but in my mind I screamed it as he fondled me... even in public places. We were in a crowded movie theater and my friend was on my right and Jerry was on my left and he fingered me. I began to go into what would be known later as Elisa mode. Elisa is strong and sexy. And she is completely void of emotions. She protects me in a way from reality. Elisa is currently tucked deep within me and she has not been ""out"" for over three years thanks to therapy, medicine, and for me coming to terms with myself.

I know that none of this may sound very creepy, but please keep in mind how young I was plus how much younger I looked and that he was a legal adult who knew exactly what he was doing and knew how to get what he wanted. After several months of being at his side ready to do anything for him at any instant, like a trained dog, I found out he had been cheating on me. He claimed he wouldn't have cheated if I had just given him my virginity and had sex with him and that he couldn't help it. Even though I was in that bad of a relationship, it broke my heart and I ended it. (Yes, I kept my virginity intact. That was the one thing I wouldn't let him have.)

A few years later and I'm back at a public school for my Senior year of high school because tl;dr I went to rehab for anorexia and other mental reasons and was inpatient for 2 months and outpatient for several more months. No one was suppose to know, but once it got out it spread like wildfire. Also, my boyfriend at the time left me for my ""best"" friend and they began dating not even a full month after we broke up. (Didn't give it up to that boyfriend either, so he moved on and found a more willing girl. I don't mean to sound harsh, but in all reality he wanted sex and he whined for it, begged, and even tried but I had to tell him forcefully to stop.) ...Bad luck with boyfriends, I know. I'm rambling again, forgive me. I haven't slept in some time now and stressed. ...The excessive amounts of coffee probably aren't helping either.

So, now I'm a senior in high school. Out of those idiotic Catholic school uniforms and into regular clothes and looking for a rebound. I get a Facebook message. You guessed it, it was Jerry. He basically apologized and wanted to meet up for coffee. Me being an idiot who obviously didn't learn the first time, agreed. One meeting turned into many and soon I was sneaking out every night to see him. We would make out in his car, and somehow my clothes always managed to come off. I was never in control of the situation and I realize that I am at fault for that. I should have spoken up about how uncomfortable I was and how it didn't feel right to be naked. 
Side note: my body still hasn't really matured at all, just a better waist to hip ratio. 

One night he got on top of me and he started to insert himself into me. That did it for me. I inwardly flipped the hell out and told him to stop. I asked him what he was doing. His response? ""I don't know."" And then he smiled at me and laid back down beside me.

He was TESTING me to see how far he could get without me saying no, without me resisting. Somewhere in the middle the angry phone calls began. He yelled at me through the phone for reasons I can't even remember and I'm so much of a loser that I still think I probably deserved to be yelled at and treated harshly.

That relationship ended almost the same way the first time we started dating. Except this time he had never broken up with his previous girlfriend, so they were still together romantically and sexually. And he was seeing another girl that he actually brought to my house and introduced me to. Both of these girls knew that I was under the assumption that I alone was dating him. And both of these girls knew about each other. Ironically, he admitted all of this (and knew I would dump him) three days after I turned 18. 

That was when I realized he was a sex addict and a polygamist. 

Fast forward to present day...
I'll be 21 in a couple months. College is wonderful. Friends are wonderful. And my boyfriend of over two years is wonderful and literally the most caring man I've ever met.
A former friend of mine texted me and said that there was something that I probably wanted to see. She told me that I would just have to see for myself. 
What I have seen cannot be unseen. He has a profile on a ""meet-and-fuck""/porno site where he has favorited hundreds of videos. All those videos? ""Barely legal!"" ""Little girl gets blank in the blank"" ""Scared virgin...blank"" ""Daddy's little girl.."" ""

Now, I get it that some of you may have fetishes for role-play. But, the girls in the videos did not look of age... trust me. And it was sick. I mean, to each their own. But, for ME to look at it and realize that I was his ""type""... it made me ill. 

Once again, I know that this may not sound creepy to many of you, but I'm putting this out there because it needs to be said:

**Do NOT be me. Do NOT stay silent. Always speak up when something doesn't feel right. Don't be afraid like I was. And do something else that I never did... tell someone about it. A parent, a sibling, even better-- a police officer.**

My mistakes of not speaking up and being to scared to say ""no"" caused me severe emotional trauma. It was so bad that in order to actually lose my virginity, I had to train my vagina and my pelvic muscles to calm down and not tense up to the point where it is almost impossible to penetrate and where the slightly penetration feels like a knife sliding in. I had to train myself to stop flinching every time someone reached out to touch me slightly. And I had to train myself to learn to trust again. Thankfully, my boyfriend has helped me immensely and thanks to him I now know how it feels to be treated right. 

**tl;dr- I started dating a guy(18) at 14, then dated him(21) again at 17. Broke up right as I turned 18. Found out he was/is into the younger girls years later and I was a victim.**

Gender: Female
Setting: Kohl's parking lot

I've been lurking this subreddit for a while and figured this would be the place where I submit my first post.

Some backstory:  I've always struggled with my weight growing up, but once I started college and got my first job, I managed to drop a fair amount of weight and actually reach what I think is probably my ideal weight.

So, having lost a lot of weight my clothes didn't fit any more and I had a job and nothing else really to spend my money on other than clothes, so I shopped a lot (because it's a lot more fun when cute clothes fit you for the first time ever).  One night, I decided to shop at Kohl's since their clothes are typically hit or miss and lately they had been nothing but ""hit"" for me.  It was late, but that didn't bother me since I was getting used to working late at my bookstore job.  I got pretty comfortable being out at night.

As I was walking into the store, I noticed there was a guy just sort of hanging out by the lights outside in the parking lot.  I figured he was just a worker taking a smoke break and wanted to be in the light instead of around the corner in the dark.

I do my shopping and by the time I come out it's about 10PM.  I see that guy again and he's just sort of wandering around the parking lot.  The store doors closed behind me and I start walking straight to my car. I'm keeping an eye on him and I notice that he's stopped wandering around and he's now heading straight for the store, which also meant he was heading straight for me.  I didn't think much of it because in my mind he was still someone who must work there and maybe is waiting for another co-worker to leave, maybe he needed a ride or something.  Maybe he's a husband who can't handle shopping with his wife.

I keep walking and he's getting closer and closer.  The closer he gets, the more I start to just sort of look at the ground to make it obvious I'm not interested in talking to this guy considering how late it was.  When he gets within about 15 feet of me, he says, ""Hey mama"".  I look up and see his face.  He's sort of a tall, maybe stocky guy.  He doesn't have a harsh or very distinctive face, just sort of looks like THAT guy who says things out loud to girls all the time as a flirting technique. The guy who's too outgoing and a little too friendly. The kind of guy that talks AT you, not with you.

I analyzed the situation.  He's 15 feet away from me.  He's big, probably slow.  His line, ""Hey mama"", is pretty lame and awkward, not something I think a dangerous person would say.  So, I'm thinking, ""I can outrun this guy if he tries anything, but he's probably just flirting and if I keep walking he'll leave me alone.  He's probably harmless.""  I took one more step and realized how wrong I was.

It was surreal.  Like a split second just exploded into a long period of time in my mind and yet all I visually remember are snapshots.  Within that split second, he managed to close the gap between us.  I don't even remember him really taking any steps, just one second he was a good distance away from me, a distance I thought was enough time for me to react and run away, and the next split second he was standing in front of me.  The next second, his arms were around me and my heart stopped.  It wasn't until that moment that I got rid of that ""invincible"" feeling and I realized just how powerless I can be to someone so much bigger than me.  

The next second, I remember he threw me on the ground and it felt like my head hit first and forced me to close my eyes from the pain.  When I opened my eyes, all I could see was the Kohl's building slowly moving away from me and I realized he was dragging me across the parking lot.  As cliche as it sounds, that whole ""I heard someone screaming somewhere and then I realized it was me screaming"" thing... that's actually how I felt.  I was so panicked that this was it, he was taking me to his car, there's no one else in the parking lot, I'm going to be one of those kids who goes missing, that I didn't even realize I was screaming.

Luckily, either 2 workers there were leaving or maybe were informed of a guy hanging around outside and so they were watching, but two Kohl's workers came running outside.  I remember the guy finally let me go, grabbed my purse, and started running towards his car.  I remember getting up off the ground and with all this adrenaline running through me and now that he was running away and there were two guys there running towards us, I (idiot) started running after him too.  One of the guys started screaming at me, ""Miss, don't run after him!  Don't run after him!""

I started feeling faint, probably from all the cuts I had from him dragging me on the pavement, and I stopped.  One guy stayed with me and the other ran after the car and got the license plate number.

The cops showed up quick and found him a few streets away.  They had to escort me in a police car and take me to him.  When we got to where they found him, he had someone else driving (which terrified me to know there were 2 guys the whole time) and despite how quickly he was caught, he had enough time to toss my purse and he had changed his clothes.  While we were driving up, I was so certain it wasn't him.  It wasn't until we pulled up close enough for me to see his face that I recognized him.

I started crying when the cops asked me questions about what happened and for whatever reason I said, ""Why me?""  And all the cop said to me was, ""Because you're small.""  The first time in my life anyone referred to me as being ""small"" instead of ""overweight"" and it was in the most negative, unfortunate way possible.  I gained back a lot of weight after that.

Well, long story short, he went to jail for a few months, they couldn't call it kidnapping because he didn't actually get me to the car, but they called it ""aggravated robbery"".  I got the court papers and found out his name was Miguel and his middle name was ""Angel"".  Wow.  And then he went on parole, ran off, and he hasn't been found since.  

TL;DR - I went shopping alone one night, a guy threw me down and dragged me across the parking lot. Got caught by police and found out his middle name is ""Angel""."	t5_2t3t8	True
1347836263.0	zzr8a	Late Night Cigarette Run	qcdiko	130	21	32	"I always thought my boyfriend was being ridiculous and a little bit sexist when he insisted he walk the dogs with me after 11pm, or insist that I take a cab home from the bar if it got too late. I’d been living in the city for nearly five years now, and before that I’d lived in a pretty rough part of Texas. I could handle myself, and NYC never felt unsafe to me.

So when Alan was stuck in the kitchen until one am, I didn’t think much of walking to the bodega to pick up a pack of cigarettes. Our apartment at the time was in a pretty quiet neighborhood in Queens, and it was three blocks away from Queens Blvd.

There weren’t a lot of streetlights, and I guess maybe a bulb had gone out recently next to the building, because the area outside the apartment was usually more well-lit. I remembered that Alan complained about it, because his boss paid him in cash once a week, and as head chef (even at a small little kosher place) it was enough to make him nervous, so he’d been coming home in cabs from Flushing on paydays.

I thought he was being overly paranoid, because it wasn’t like our neighborhood was awash with criminals. 

I tugged the zipper of my hoodie up and I wished I’d worn something a little bit more substantial underneath. It was October, and the air was starting to chill a bit too much for my southern tastes.

I’d just reached the corner of the building when a man called out to me from a van. “Hey, miss, can you help me?”

I wanted to just keep walking, but sometimes my manners get the best of me, and I figured he was in a van and I was standing at least two yards away. Besides, it wasn’t exactly a desolate area. I crossed my arms and looked at him, but I kept my weight on the balls of my feet, because I could feel that there was something not completely right about this.

He was sitting in a van with the power turned completely off. No lights on in the car at all, and I could barely see his face.

“Come here.”

Yeah, no, that was not going to happen. I was nice, but not nice enough to go traipsing up to a stranger in a dark van in the middle of the night.

“Come on, mami, come over here,” he called out again. “You look so cute walking those dogs.”

My blood froze and my hands shook and I walked like a demented speed-walker away from his truck.

How did he know I had dogs? 

 “Hey,” he called.

I’d walked them well over five hours ago.

A car door slammed, and his voice carried more clearly across the night air.

“Come here.”

I could run back to my apartment, but I’d have to go through him.

“I have something to show you.”

The bodega was a straight shot, but it was three blocks away.

I looked desperately for anyone who might help, but there was just an old, drunk Russian guy throwing up in some bushes. Just great.

I started running. My ballet flats slipped against the sidewalk and I nearly turned my ankle, but the adrenaline kept me going. I refused to look behind me. I just wanted to grab my phone and call the cops, but I only had a block and a half to go and I didn’t want to risk anything slowing me down.

I realized he wasn’t following me when I heard a car engine start behind me and I whipped my head around. He was gone. I even felt a little stupid, like, maybe some guy was just catcalling and being a dick, but that didn’t make him dangerous.

Then I saw his van pull onto the street. He was driving the wrong way, against traffic, but I don’t think he cared that much about traffic violations.

I sprinted like I was back in high school track, and he just kept pace with me, this big, ugly white van with fading paint that looked like something you would buy at a car lot especially created for creepy people with bad intentions.

I felt a huge stitch in my side as I neared the bodega and Queens Boulevard, and I was relieved I’d finally made it because I couldn’t run anymore. Cars rushed by, and people ambled down the street. I’d made it to civilization. I was safe. 

He left the van in the middle of the street and stepped out.

I ran into the bodega, but I felt vulnerable standing there with all the glass windows.

Sure, Queens Boulevard was busy, but would anyone really intervene if some guy tried to grab me? Tales of Kitty Genovese ran through my head, and the bodega guy just shook his head furiously at me for making his night more difficult.

I called 911, and the man outside watched me during the entire phone call. He stood next to his truck so that shadows obscured his face, but when he slowly tilted his head I nearly dropped the phone.

Before I’d even finished the call, he wagged his finger at me and drove away.

The bodega man was pissed I’d brought my drama to his business, and wanted me to leave after I bought my pack of cigarettes, but as bad as I wanted a smoke I waited for my boyfriend to show up from work, and then we both waited for the cops, which took nearly half an hour.

The cops were about as nice as NYPD cops get, but there clearly wasn’t a lot to do about anything. They said they’d patrol the neighborhood some more, and they escorted us back to Alan’s apartment.

We moved a couple of weeks later – we’d already put the money down on another apartment – but I never saw him again. 

TL;DR: Went to buy a pack of cigarettes at night, got stalked by a crazy van man, quit smoking soon after.

1376425037.0	1kaun7	The K-Mart Creeper	dal_segno	127	21	21	"This happened several years ago, so some details as far as the specific dialogue are somewhat fuzzy. That said, I remember it pretty clearly, given how off the whole interaction was.

I was in my mid-late teens at the time, probably 16-17. I'd gone to K-Mart with my mom, and went off on my own to browse the videogame/electronics section.

I didn't hear him approach, but while I was scanning the game titles, I started to get that feeling you get when someone is standing just a *bit* too close. I did a quick head-check, and saw a short, but very overweight man standing at my shoulder, maybe two feet away. Probably in his forties or so. He was staring at me expectantly, and I thought maybe he wanted to look at something I was blocking.

I mumbled a ""sorry"" (never been very socially comfortable, myself) and edged away from him.

""Nah, you're fine,"" he answered, rather cheerily. ""You're into games?""

I was, so we started talking about what kinds of games I liked, which ones he'd played. The conversation shifted over time, and was actually pretty mundane until he started talking about taking vacations, where I'd been and where he'd been. First major red flag came up at this point-

""I went on a skiing trip once, you know,"" he was saying, ""and some guy went off one of the jumps. He landed wrong, broke his leg pretty bad.""

I gave the socially accepted, ""Oh, that's too bad-"" but he went on:

""Yeah, everyone says that. But you know what, I think people actually enjoy it.""

""What?""

""I really think that people secretly love watching other people hurt themselves really badly. Like, just eat that shit up. I know I do. It's like when you see a bad car wreck and you're just hoping to see the, I dunno, guts and stuff. It's the best.""

The whole time he's going through this speech, he's getting more and more excited - breathing fast, all that. The worst part is that, while he's getting into it, he's advancing on me. I backed away, and ended up bumping into the aisle wall-thing. I remember feeling the display hooks hitting me in the back and just being like oh, fuck.

""So I keep going on the ski trips, because people *always* break an arm or a leg or something, and it's great. Sometimes you see the bones poking out, too - you ever see that?""

I'm glancing around, looking for a store clerk or another customer or anyone at this point.

""So what do you think? Don't you just love it?""

At this point, my mom came looking for me (thank god) and found me backed up to the display with some visibly excited creeper wheezing all over me. She rushed up and said something like, ""C'mon, time to go"" and the guy looked up at her and took a step back, giving me room to make my escape.

But as I hurried after my mother, I heard him - ""Farewell! I'll talk to you again sometime - I'll summon you with my mind!""

(Yes, I swear to god, he said that exact thing.)

Thankfully, he never managed to telepathically summon me."	t5_2t3t8	True
1369228237.0	1ety7j	When flashers reappear in daylight.	TwerkOnThatShark	131	23	22	"Heeeey! You guys may remember this story about the dude on my back porch. If not, [the story's here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1d32vu/pull_your_junk_out_on_my_back_porch_will_ya/). Welp. I finally figured out what happened to the guy. Because I saw him again in a less-than-pleasant manner.

Typed this up last night but there was an error when I posted. Let me try this again.

Well, guess who I saw this morning? *Great* way to start off my day.

For starters, I'm a 22 year old female. That being said, let's continue. I'm on my porch this morning before I have to go to work. Sipping my drink and messing with my phone when I'm partially startled as I hear a ""Hey there!"" I look up, and guess who's on my walkway?

It's the guy who, about a month ago, decided it would be a grand idea to whip out his junk on my back porch in the middle of the night. Seriously, all I could really do was look up at him with a look that screamed ""Oh man, you are *seriously* in my yard right now, aren't you?"". My course of action, a slow shake of my head and resuming my tinkering. I am not giving this guy the time of day. Nope. Noooope. Nope.

""Hellooooo?"" He waved his hand close to my face. Oh gawd, he's still there. And in my space now. Okay, maybe he's here to make nice or apologize or whatever. How do you go about apologizing for something like that? *Oh, hey! Sorry I exposed myself on your back porch! Friends?* Whatever.

""Yes?"" Yeah, no sense in hiding my annoyance, bro. You know what you did.

Him: ""What's up?""

Me: ""The usual.""

............

Him: ""How's your day?""

Me: ""Not much of a day, seeing as how it's still early.""

Him: ""Hahahahaha! Cool! Who ya' texting?""

If this was most anyone else in the world, I'd probably be civil and happy to talk to them, but this is a bit too surreal for me, and I'm done being nice to perverts and creeps. So, mug down, I give him a death-look from the stoop.

Me: ""Okay, you need to go.""

Him: ""Wha- why?"" He starts getting defensive. Whatever dude.

Me: ""Because, last I saw you, you were running away from my house in the middle of the night."" *After you had your junk all over my back door, so excuse me if I'm not so friendly anymore, bro.*

Him: ""I thought we were friends!"" He starts to raise him voice at me. 

*Yeah, cool, I'll be right over to rub my ass all over your windows.* Casually speaking to each other a handful of times for a few weeks automatically makes us bosom buddies, apparently.

Me: ""Well, no, not after what happened the last time we saw each other, I'd have to say no."" Do you I have to remind him of what he did? Seriously? Could this get any more terrible? At this point, I'm starting to shake a little. I couldn't tell if it was because I was angry or nervous or what, but I wanted this idiot away from me.

He then loomed over me and said ""You need to STOP!"" So I stand up, barely reaching his eye level, even though I was up one step, and looked him straight in the eye. 

""Seriously, you need to go."" Then I walk up my steps. 

I FEEL HIM BEHIND ME AS I REACH MY DOOR. He's barely an inch away, and I look over my shoulder and see him. At this point, there is no way I'm opening my door, for fear he'll follow me in or something. For a quick second, I pondered slamming the screen door into him face, if I could only manage it.

""Get off my porch!"" I said, voice raised. This was actually very bad, as I am literally unable to physically yell, thanks to a past medical run-in that resulted in damaged vocal cords.

""Why are you being such a bitch???"" he bellowed angrily. Now I knew that I was shaking from nervousness, as this guy was always very docile and calm, if not weird, whenever we had previously interacted.

I was nanoseconds away from pushing him backwards so that he would take a tumble down those concrete steps. 

""Dude, you're-""

""Hey! What's going on, TwerkOnThatShark?"" *That* was the heavenly sound of my neighbor, Mr. G, who had come out of his house and was now viewing the two of us. Mr. and Mrs. G are retired 60-something year olds who are sweet as pie and are the only people on my block I don't actively ignore. I had thought they were vacationing in their many hideaways around the country [they are gone 2/3 of the time, having their grandchildren so occasional maintenance on their lawn or hang out in their house, or whatever] , but, lucky me, they happen to be home this morning!

""This guy bothering you?"" Mr. G asks in an abnormally gruff voice.

""I just came over to-"" the guy starts out before I interrupt.

""Yes, he is. I want to get into my house."" That was meant to come out a lot more confident, but I ended up nearly stuttering it.

""Boy....."" Mr. G started out before being interrupted with a ""WHATEVER!"" as the offender suddenly turns and marches off my property and turn down the sidewalk in a huff to wherever. 

I seriously felt like I couldn't even move. I just watched that fucker go down the walk until I couldn't see him anymore. Mr. G asked if I was okay and what that was all about, so I came and sat with him on his porch and told him all about what had happened at what had started it all. He kindly asked if I wanted to stay in his house for a bit while he dialed the police. I declined and said that I was going to call the cops too and just go back to my place. 

Gave the cops his name and told him there had been an incident between me and him previously. Cops said they'd look into it, but, again, I haven't heard anything about it since then.

Doors and windows locked and secured tonight, even though it's hot as balls and I have no AC. Whatever. Time for epic fan night. Tomorrow, I look into getting a restraining order. Hurrah."	t5_2t3t8	True
1365037850.0	1bmobu	When our fire dimmed	batmangirl15	140	34	25	"When i was around thirteen i went camping with my girl scout troop. This wasn't uncommon for us, as we camped often, at least twice a year. The only difference was that my troop had the privilage to camp out two nights and in cabins. The cabins were not big. I was 5 foot and if i were to lay down width wise we only had about 3 feet of walking space in between the bunks. each side had two sets of bunk beds so there were 8 beds in each cabin and there were four cabins. We had a large troop so we occupied three cabins including the moms who stayed the night with us. During the day activities went on as normal, other troops came to spend the day and we did arts and crafts, archery, and other sport like events. This ended around 7 when all the other girls went home.

Around this time we cooked dinner, ate, talked then started a fire. We sat around and had girl talk like normal, ate dough boys, and marshmellows until 9 when we had to go to bed due to the camp sight's curfew.

In my cabin I had my two best friends, one in the bed bellow me, and the other in the bunk across from me.  We had bunks that were close to the window. To imagine the cabin just imagine a rectange with walls, and a screen door, now go into the screen door and on either side of you there are, as i said, four bunks, and at the end of the ""cooridor?"" a window. My mom was sleeping in the cabin across the way with my troop leader and the other mom.

Soon we were all asleep but my friend, Lisa, who was bellow me wasn't very good at sleeping outside and was soon awake and sitting on the edge of my top bunk poking me. I cracked my eyes open and shone my flash light at Lisa, then at Tara who was across the way, she was awake as well. Since we weren't technically allowed to be awake unless we were using the bathroom we decided to go get my mom who would take us through the trail to go to the bathroom just to let Lisa catch a breather.

By now the fire was basically out and we had my flashlight as our light source. So we bundled up because New England is Freezing at night even if it is spring. As we were getting dressed i put my flashlight into my mouth so i could use both my hands. But out of the corner of my eye i saw a shadow. I thought it was my own and camping was playing tricks on me but i looked anyway.

My scream may have broken all the rules the camp had about curfew. My entire cabin was up, my friends were screaming and my mom and my leader were trampling over each other to get into the cabin.

When i turned to look at the shadow i saw that it was actually a man staring through the window. I don't know how long he was there, and when i started screaming he took off. My troop leader talked to the ranger the next day and he said he would talk to the night time ranger but we never got an answer other than maybe it was an animal.

Either way i never went camping there again. I hope you guys enjoyed reading this. It still haunts me to this day "	t5_2t3t8	True
1364641491.0	1baplz	Someone in my basement.	DeathAndTheGirl	120	14	37	"Unfortunately an event has recently occurred, and now that the dust has settled, I've decided to share.

I live on a rough, but generally harmless street. The people are nice, and like to drink out on their porches late at night. Everyone knows everyone, at least by face, if not by name.

The house I live in is a great big old house, built about 1910. It has a basement, a main and upper level, and a small attic. We've got an adjacent garage that was added on much later after the house was built. It connects through the kitchen, separated by a heavy wooden door, with a small screened in porch between the two. (That was obviously the secondary entrance to the house, now blocked by the garage.)
Besides the cellar door in the backyard, the front door is the only used entrance and exit. My bedroom is on the main floor. I live with my girlfriend of nearly six years, and our purebred, pink-nose 95lbs pitt. Our dog was trained by my gf's brother, the dog's previous owner, as a guard/attack dog, as he was a drug dealer and couldn't have people breaking into his house. When we got our own place, he gave us Karma as a house present to keep us safe.

Now.
For a few days, when it's usually just the dog and I home, we'd both been hearing some knocking/banging sounds in the house. The first sound we heard sounded like a heavy door shutting. She'd pop her head up from a dead sleep and kind of grumble, looking around. When she'd let it go, I would, too. But these strange sounds persisted, nearing the point that I began to believe perhaps some sort of racoon was in my attic. But with dog, and flashlight in tow, we turned up empty handed. Dusty, but empty handed. 
One day in particular, I was showering when Karma started barking really aggressively, I could hear the snarls and her throat vibrating. I ran out of the bathroom, to the bedroom where my gf's AK-47 is kept. I found the dog confronting our refrigerator, and scolded her. (Not realizing she was hearing the sounds beneath.)

That night in bed, my gf and I could hear a man talking in angry gibberish, but with our windows open, we assumed it was a drunk next door, and slept through it. 

I awoke the next morning, my gf gone to work already, by the sounds of loud, heavy thumping in the basement. This is where our laundry appliances are, and sometimes our washer -Which is ancient, but reliable - makes a whud-whud-whud sound when doing the final rinse cycle. I ignored it, thinking my gf may have thrown a load in before work, though I heard Karma growl a few times. She'd been growling at everything it seemed, so I dismissed it. 

About an hour later, I went to the basement to check on the wash. I was confused that there was none to be switched, so I immediately felt on edge. The dog, who is somehow too much of a baby to ever walk down these rickety basement stairs, stayed at the top, but with her big ol' head poking down, listening. I could hear her sniffing and snorting and letting out little complaints here and there. 

On the wall opposite the laundry appliances is the door that, when opened, takes you up a set of stairs to the door in the backyard. (The door in the backyard lies flat on the ground, like a cellar door. I don't know who made this house, it's all wonky.)

To my surprise, the locks were busted, (combination locks) and the door was ajar. I rushed upstairs and took the dog out of the house. She immediately ran to the backyard, where I saw the door had been busted open.

It then occurred to me, that someone didn't break into my basement. *They were breaking out of it.*

I filed a report with the police, who are still as unsure as I am of how this person got into my house. They agree someone left the basement, possibly because they couldn't leave without being seen/attacked via canine. But then how did they get in? Obviously no signs of forced entry. The locks have all been replaced. The basement shows no evidence of someone being in it, other than us. Worse, is that I had been down there fairly regularly doing laundry. He could've hid easily, as the basement has separated areas. 

I would've never of seen him.
But he saw me."	t5_2t3t8	True
1358794164.0	1703rd	Do you want candy?	bear123456789	117	10	13	"i was 10, and was out selling candy for my school, i went to catholic school, it was just something we did every year. i live in a suburban area, known for safety but it also has plenty of trees and wooded areas. 

i brought my friend who was 9 at the time with me, and we walked from house to house. we came to a house that was kind of surrounded by bushes near the entrance, i could hear a lot of dogs barking. i knocked on the door, and here's the weird part: the man who answered the door never opened the screen, but i could see the inside of the house. there were no dogs, and i never saw the man who i talked to

""im selling candy for my school ***, would you like to buy some?""
""come inside, itll just be a second, i need help with my puppies""

remember, i have not seen this man at all, but the front door is open, the screen door is not. my friend is standing behind me. i remember she wanted to go help the puppies, i should add that i'm allergic to dogs and my face swells up if i get licked, so that may have helped me refuse to go inside, along with my mother successfully raising me to be completely paranoid of strangers, so i automatically said

 ""no, do you want to buy some candy though?""
""just come inside real quick""

i was hit with the strongest feeling of fear i remember to this day, (not sure if i was scared of getting licked by one of the dogs, or of him) i didn't reply and he said...
""hello?""
i stupidly replied
""Do you want candy?""
""come here for a second, just real quick""
then, i shit you not, whoever this was started to open the screen, but i only saw his hand, never his face because then i yelled, ""run!"" and we both bolted, i heard the screen door slam, we didn't look back until we were on a different street so i couldnt tell you if the man ever came out or not, 

to this day, eight years later, i still wonder what the hell that was all about. i never saw any dogs even though i heard them, i never saw the man either, thankfully

1358411504.0	16qrh7	CVS creeper	Polite_Naivety	132	23	21	"A few years ago (when I was 20-ish years old), I went to CVS/pharmacy, I think to get some medicine for my sick boyfriend (now husband).  While I am there, I browse some of the other aisles briefly.  As I am looking at some ramen noodles and cookies, I see a very tall (looked about 6'4''), older (50's?), disheveled looking fellow.  I live in the suburbs, where the sight of homeless people are pretty rare, yet this guy looked as if he hadn't bathed in a month, his clothing stained with who knows what, his hair shaggy and in a greasy matted state.  He stops me, smiles, looming over me (I am 5'3"" and 110lbs), standing very too close for comfort, and asks me for the time.  Even though I felt something was ""off"" about this guy (I mean, he was TOO stereotypical to be true, you know?), I really try to treat everyone I come into contact with well (not to mention I use to part of an intense hippie crowd, so eccentric, unbathed people weren't too much of stretch for me).  I just smile at this man politely, and tell him the time on my phone, and go back to my business browsing, figuring that just because this guy is looking and acting a little off, I shouldn't be so paranoid, and shamed myself to be too quick to judge.  

I continue for a few minutes browsing the aisles, and I can see this man staring at me over the aisles, smiling.  I tried to pretend I didn't notice him, and just kept him in my peripheral.  Finally, I think just being in the same building as him was giving my nerves a shock, because no matter where I went, I felt like he was staring at me.  I wrap things up and go to the cashier, and she asks for my CVS card.  Crap! I forgot it at home!  No worries, I can pull it up using my phone number.  I remember being hesitant, because at this time the man was now directly behind me in line, but again I just shamed myself for being paranoid and judgmental, and I went ahead and gave the cashier my phone number. 

 As soon as I gave it to her.... right there in that very line... my phone started to ring.  My mind immediately went ""HOLY SHIT"", paranoia speaking to me, but I push it down again and tell myself ""Oh please, WAY too stereotypical, don't be so judgmental, it's probably just your mom calling, etc.""  I scramble to get my phone out of my purse, but as soon as I get it out, the ringing stops. The number is one I don't recognize, another red flag, but again I think ""oh, okay, just a solicitor.. or wrong number... surely not anything out of the ordinary"".  I pay for my things, and go out to my car.  It is broad day light.  As soon as I get in my car, right there in the parking lot, I get another call.  I answer ""Hello?"".  Caller, an older man's voice... sounds VERY familiar.. like 5 minutes ago-familiar.  All he says is ""It's meeeeeeeeeeeeeee"", and giggles... literally giggles.

At this point, I am 99% sure it is the man who asked for the time in the store, but I hold onto my denial and think ""There is no fucking way.  This is too stupid to be real.""  I ask the man ""Who is ME?"".  He stupidly told me his name, I forget it at this time... Matt.. Mark...Mike?  I very hopefully think ""Oh... it wasn't really that creepy guy in the store.  It is just some guy who called the wrong number,he probably thinks he called a friend of his, cut him a break.""    So I tell the man ""I'm sorry, sir, I think you have the wrong number.""  and I hang up, and drive back to my boyfriend's and go about my business.  Then I start getting calls a few times a day,  now from private numbers.  I ignore them out of my paranoia, and just try to convince myself that they are solicitors or something.  I finally pick up the phone.  Me: ""Hello? Who is this?""   the man on the phone ""It's meeeeeeeeeeeeee"".  this went on for about a week.  I kept thinking this was just some sick joke or something and tried to ignore it.  Every once in a while I would answer just in case it wasn't him, but it always was.  He would just say ""It's meeeeeeeeee"" over and over and giggle. 

 I finally got fed up with feeling like a helpless victim, and I called the police to ask for advice, and how to deescalate the situation, and to just make a report of it from what I knew, just in case things were to get out of hand.  The man ended up calling back, of course, and I (usually a very meek, shy, self-sacrificingly nice person) rustled my woman skirts and basically told him off. I made note to remember his name, and I called him by it, and said basically that he needs to back off, this is entirely the wrong way of gaining attention.  I flat out told him that he is being creepy, the reasons why he is creepy (maybe no one ever told him and he seriously doesn't know?), and that I have informed the police.  If he continues to harass me or contact me in any way, I will pursue further action.  

He went silent for a few seconds, then just said "".....oh...."" and *click*.  Thankfully never heard from him again. 

What I learned from this is: 
 1. Don't say your phone number outloud in public, or any personal information for that matter. 
 2. If someone gives you a creepy vibe, try to push away your niceness/meekness and act faster and swifter in your best interest.
 3. I think creepy people target me because of my polite naivety, and that I look much younger than I am.  Try to look strong and confident, even if you aren't on the inside.  Having the gall to defend yourself seems to scare creepers back into their holes."	t5_2t3t8	True
1352139839.0	12og8q	Bad Romance	lalaland302	130	26	23	"Its was the winter of 2008-2009 when I met Mike. I had just graduated high school and was working a night shift at the Wal-Mart in the next town over. One day I logged into Facebook and noticed I had a friend request. I got that excitement we all know that we secretly get when we have a friend request and we hope it's not some random e-whore trying to get more friends. I clicked the button and immediately recognized the person as the son of my childhood Girlscout leader. He was a moderately attractive man, heavy build, big brown glittery eyes, dark skin, and a gorgeous smile. I was curious so I accepted his friend request and we started IMing for a while.

After a week or so, we finally decided to meet up for a little bit and decided to meet at one of the parks located near my house in our small Colorado town. Being as it was kind of late in the evening, (Mike also worked nights at the meat packing company) and I being a very careful person, decided I would take my dog with me. My dog is actually the sweetest thing in the world, border collie/golden lab mix, and would never hurt anybody, but she was protective and would bark if we even rough housed at home or if someone made her nervous. I figured she would be good for protection and if she didn't get nervous about this guy, then I didn't have anything to worry about. I hooked Sydney up to her leash and mad the mile trek to the park. By cutting my way through the elementary school and across the large grass lot, Sydney and I made it to the park in less than 10 minutes where I found Mike sitting on one of the swings and walked over to him. I was a little leery at first, but eventually warmed up and we decided to walk the trails that led around the golf course. We spent an hour or two walking and talking, and found out we had quite a bit in common. It went well and eventually we parted ways.

The first couple of weeks went by smoothly. We'd meet up before we went to work at night and spend a couple of hours walking or sitting at my house watching television in my room on the nights we had off, as we both had Wednesdays and Thursdays off. I remember one night towards the beginning of our ""relationship"" we met up at the park again. He parked his truck and we decided to go for a walk. We had just started working up the hill on the road when a cop pulled up next to us and questioned us. The officer had thought his truck broke down and wanted to make sure we didn't need help. After taking our names and licenses (making sure we weren't out past the town curfew for minors) everything checked out and he let us on our way. We decided it was pretty cold to be walking so we got into his truck and went for a drive instead. Eventually we parked next to the basketball courts and spent some more time talking and sharing stories. This is when I had my first kiss. Now, when I look back on it, I remember how terrible it was.

""What's today's date?"" Mike asked me.

""December 4th."" 

""Then that will be day the you had your first kiss.""

I really wish he hadn't said that, because this is something I have spent my whole life trying not to remember. He was a terrible kisser and ended up drooling on me. I guess I should have cut it off right then, but I figured maybe he'd get better.

Christmas rolled around and we exchanged gifts and started spending more time together. Then things started getting weird. He was always talking about this girl he really liked. She was 15 (Mike was 22 and I was 18). This is when the red flags started going up. He would always tell me how she gave the best head and how he liked sex and has had sex with so many girls. I felt like he was pressuring me or encouraging me to give myself up to him and that's not what I was looking to do. I'm not so much of a prude, but I spent the many years before me as a girl with very low confidence, always struggling with my weight and my appearances. I hated always comparing myself to these girls he claimed to have had sexual relations with.

In late January, I finally came to my senses. I realized how completely creepy this guy was and that I didn't need this in my life. He had been telling me about how he was trying to get this girl to speak with him again, as her parents had prohibited her from seeing him. He would leave notes with another one of his teenage friends to give to her at school. Then he'd start reminding me that we were not a couple, we were just friends with benefits. I may not have had self-esteem, but I sure had self-respect and I was not going to be one of those girls who got tied up in a relationship where the guy simply didn't want to consider them a couple because he had other girls he would rather be with. He called me one night and I told him that I didn't want to speak to him anymore. I told him I had heard enough about his sexual encounters and that it was creepy that he would even think to tell me of such things. 

""And to think I was just going to ask you to be my girlfriend,"" he told me.

""Well then I called you just in time. I don't want to be your girlfriend. Please don't call me anymore.""

A couple of days went by and I hadn't seen him or heard from him. I began spending time with my friend and co-worker, Jessie. Then one night at work, I was in my department in infants, and Jessie was over in the craft department and needed some help cutting fabric. Our small-town Walmart wasn't much for training and I was the only person that night who knew how to do it, so I went over to crafts to help her. We were cutting the fabric when I heard the familiar sound of Mike and his friend Daniel in the toys department nearby, I looked out of the corner of my eye and there he was, watching me. I had told Jessie about the relationship and how strange it had become. After we cut the fabric for the customer and the customer went on her way, I pulled Jessie to the next aisle and told her that Mike was there and that I wanted her to walk me to my car after work. The feeling in the pit of my stomach made me more nervous than ever. There were only a few minutes of work left so I hurried back to my department and finished my work and met Jessie in the back at the time clock. We clocked out and hurried into the parking lot and to our vehicles.

Suddenly I was just seeing Mike everywhere. I thought I was just paranoid, that since I didn't want to see him, it would feel like he was all over the place. I would run into him, literally, at the dollar store, the grocery store, the movie theater. As his personality quickly soured, I started seeing how unattractive he really was. His big brown eyes started to look like beady, menacing rat's eyes and his smile seemed more sinister and terrifying. The site of him would make me cringe. Then the text messages started.

I should tell you, I lived on a street of modular homes off of a county road, Although we weren't really near the rest of the town, we were still considered in city limits. To drive past my house, you would have to drive out of town to the first county road, then onto my street, which was kind of like a cul-de-sac. It went straight down and then turn at the end and go back around and meet up with the main road in the middle. My bedroom window in the house faced the elementary school nearby and the street is not in a location that you would just drive by during your daily routes.

That's when I got the first text from him in a couple of weeks, and it was my night off, ""Hey, Jackie, what's up?""

It was from Mike. I ignored the message and went about messing around on my computer when my phone dinged at me again, ""I know you're awake, I drove by and your light is on.""

At this point, I panicked a little bit. I shut off my light, closed my blinds, and went around to make sure the doors were locked. Being that I was working nights and I had only recently woken up, I just went back to my computer and my phone dinged again, ""I see how it is. See you soon.""

I was still seeing him everywhere. He'd be at Walmart every night before he went to work and I would hide myself somewhere so as to avoid him. He would stand in my department and wait for me to return before eventually leaving. I ended up quitting my job and became afraid to even leave my house alone. Jessie had coincidentally quit the day before me and would come to my house to pick me up before we'd head off to hang out.

Valentines day rolled around and I still hadn't completely gotten back on track to my sleep schedule. I was taking a nap in the late morning/early afternoon. When I woke up there was a bouquet of daisies (my favorite flower) on my desk and a puzzle of a penguin (I love penguins and puzzles), along with a card and a mixed CD. I opened the card and it was one of those stupid singing cards and written were the words ""YOUR SO SEXY"" in Mike's ugly handwriting. I threw the card into the trash and remembered the mixed CD. Being curious, I put it into my CD player to find that it was full of stupid love songs. I took it out and broke it in half before throwing it into the trash along with everything else. I went out to the living room to find little my brother (who was 10) had returned from school. I asked him if he knew anything about the gifts on my desk.

""Mike brought them over. He took them to your room, he was in there for a while so I figured you knew.""

Feeling even more creeped out, I walked back to my room and sat at my desk. I was texting Jessie and telling her about the gifts when my I received another text message, ""Did you like my gifts? By the way, you look so peaceful when you sleep."" I literally had to run to the bathroom and throw up. I couldn't believe he was standing in my room watching me sleep.

Eventually the messages started slowing down before coming to a stop. I didn't run into him anymore. I assumed he had gotten tired of following me with no results. Soon it was as though he had completely disappeared, or so I hoped.

Last week, I was back at Walmart picking up some groceries. I was browsing through the teas, deciding upon the better value. Suddenly I just got this unmistakable feeling of being watched. I looked around and saw nobody, figuring it was just the chill of the store, I continued browsing through the different teas. That's when I heard his voice, ""Hey."" I looked over and right next to me, where seconds ago, nobody had been, there was Mike. Staring at me with his devilish eyes. I quickly grabbed a box of tea bags, mumbled, ""Hi."" and walked off as fast as I could without looking too obvious.

1349596328.0	112wvi	Friend turned out to be a Murderer. 	Acseeley	121	17	14	"I was a Marine stationed in Jacksonville, NC at the time. I lived in the barracks, but had a friend named Matt Hurley who was a Crew Chief on an Osprey who lived off base. He and his wife were really cool and we had a group of friends that would party at their house quite a bit. He wasn't ""plain vanilla"" normal, they had an open marriage and a friend of mine lived with them and partook of his wife quite often. Other than that, he was a normal Marine. In 2000 things took a turn for Matt, he got busted down for something and went from Sgt. to Cpl. This forced him to live in a ""Restriction"" Barracks on base. One day he up and went missing, UA, and could not be located. I think he was gone for about a week, charged up a shitload on Cash advances on his credit card, and ultimately we found out he spent it on crack. He turned up in the hospital after some drug deal had gone awry and someone stabbed him. He had one of his lowlife friends drive his Escort and park it in the driveway of his home off base, and he told his wife that it needed to be cleaned out, to not go inside it (gave some BS excuse I can't remember because nobody thought twice about it at the time). That was late in the week, like a Thursday but I am not 100% sure. So he is in jail, and his wife is done; she is packing up their daughter and moving. So being the friends that we were we helped her load the moving truck which took a couple days.

It was a night shift, I know this because I was working on base and there weren't a lot of people around and I get a call at work from one of my buddies:
Buddy: ""Dude, we just found a dead body in the back of Matt's Car."" Me: ""Whaaat? run that by me again?"" Buddy: ""Under the clothes in the back car, there is a body. I went looking for (Wife's Name)'s camera in the car and I found it.""
So while we were packing up his wife for several days, we had no idea we were walking past a corpse. Turns out Matt had gone on this crack binge and some girl had tried to steal a rock from him and ended up tucking it away in her mouth. So he choked her, ultimately taking a cord or something, wrapping it around her neck, and torquing it down with another object like a twist tie then duct taping a bag over her head.

True story. Still friends with the guy who found her, we haven't talked about it in a long time.

1367290229.0	1ddwn3	Come on inside.	Devileyekill	132	23	12	"I've been reading this subreddit for a while now and one or the posts brought back to memory a chilling experience of mine.

Backstory time.

I live with 3 roommates, we are all young guys in our 20's, so typically we aren't worried about anything except not having enough damn food. 

We have different work schedules and only a 3 bedroom apartment. So of course the youngest one gets the living room to sleep in. He also has the latest shift coming home at around 3 am. Normally there is one of us home at all times unless we're out so we keep our door unlocked. 

At this particular time two of my roommates were gone for at least the weekend and the other one was expected to be home soon. I remember that I had to park across the parking lot that night because our neighbors were having a party with quite a few people. After a few hours I heard my roommate coming in, or at least trying to. Now, I love scaring my roommates when ever possible so I crept up to the door waiting for him. But he was taking forever to unlock the door so I just punched the door and yelled ""BOOM!"" as a last attempt at getting any shock from him. Well it worked perfectly because I heard him stumble back and fall into the other side of the corridor. Laughing, I unlocked the door and checked to see if he was alright only to see him sprinting off at an alarming speed. 

It was only then did my roommate ask ""What the FUCK was that??"".... from behind me in the living room.... Chills went up my spine as I realised I almost let some random burglar into my apartment without even knowing it.

I don't know what would have happened if I didn't want to scare my roommate that night and instead had just unlocked the door and let him in. Also the next day our maintenance man said multiple people's apartments had been broken in to and my charger to my GPS had been stolen out of my car... Not the actual GPS... just the charger...

TL:DR? I accidentally gave a would be house burglar the ability to fly by turning him into a human shit rocket."	t5_2t3t8	True
1366916878.0	1d3nl8	The Man in Her Bed	StrangeLoveNebula	125	22	9	"Alright, so this is an old coworker's story that I thought I'd share because its always creeped me out. Stella was a pretty tough old bird, but even she was shaken by this. Stella's husband is really devout, and usually goes to church every Sunday. Sometimes Stella goes, but since she sometimes worked Saturday nights, she would often stay and sleep in while her husband went to the early service.

One Sunday she did just that, and her husband gave her a kiss on the cheek before he left, which she groggily remembered. About half an hour later, she felt someone get into bed with her. Being disoriented and exhausted, she figured her husband decided to leave church early or didn't go or something. They were spooning, for lack of a better term, just cuddling while he stroked her hair and whatnot. He's kissing her neck and getting more handsy when she feels rough stubble and freezes. Her husband always has a clean shave, not an inch of stubble. She rolls over and it's some Mexican guy. She freaks out and jumps off the bed, and he starts trying to rapidly speak to her in Spanish. She lunges for the phone on the nightstand and calls 911 while the guy tries to flee. They catch him (Stella lived in kind of a rural area with lots of fields), and they find out he was a migrant worker.


Not sure what happened with him after that, but I figured I'd share Stella's story with you guys considering it gave me chills and she would never post it to reddit anyways (she hates computers). She also worked as a policewoman for a long time and has other creepy stories from that aspect, so if you're interested, I'll share. Thanks for reading!"	t5_2t3t8	True
1362947045.0	1a1fu2	Classroom stalker	EgweneSedai	121	17	15	"Hi guys and gals! First post on this subreddit.

A few years back I tried to sell some dresses online. I put up pictures of me wearing them. They weren't revealing and I had cropped out my head. I was stupid enough to have my phone number on there, hoping it would sell faster. Not long after I had sold all the dresses I started getting creepy calls. Pretty sure they were related to the dress-selling since I hadn't put up my phone number anywhere else.  

The first call was on a Saturday. I was sleeping in, so when I got a call at 9:30 I was a bit annoyed. I answered the phone sleepily with ""hello this is Egwene"" and got no answer. I waited a bit and then suddenly someone said a bit flustered ""hello"". Nothing else. I ask who I'm speaking to and the man says ""Peter"". Still nothing else. I press further and start to ask what he wants but he interrupts and asks me ""is this a good time for you?"". Since I'm really annoyed by now I tell him it isn't and he says ""ok I'll call back. Bye!"" and hangs up. I thought it was a call-center or something and go back to sleep.


A few days later I get called again. This time there was moaning, breathing and porn sounds in the background. I was dumbfounded and didn't know what to say really, so I just hung up and laughed it off. This continued for a while though, a long while. I'm pretty sure the man who called just days earlier was the same guy (in any case this ""Peter"" never called me back) and I'm pretty sure he was looking at the pictures of me in the dresses while he was phone-fapping. Gross. Months go by of me getting sporadic calls in the middle of the night. I generally just didn't answer and had my phone muted by default. My boyfriend once picked up the phone but he hung up immediately.


Ok now fast forward a few months later when the phone calls had died down a bit. Hadn't gotten one in weeks when all of a sudden, yup, missed call by ""anonymous"" (always a hidden number of course). I started really considering getting a new number, but I had to go to class so I put it in the back of my mind.


I get to class and notice that I don't know anyone there. I'm also a bit late so I just sit at the very end of a row of seats, one of the few open seats left. It happens to be right next to some guy who looks at me a bit creepily, grinning. He is a scrawny fellow with a scruffy chin/neckbeard, sitting in a slumped position. I think nothing of it, maybe he's just awkward. During the class I saw from the corner of my eye that he was looking at me, and I don't mean glancing. He had his head turned completely to the side and staring directly at my face and what I was writing down. This started to bug the crap out of me so at some point I just looked straight at him and said ""hm?"", thinking he might want to ask me something but is too shy to do so. He turns bright red, stammers a bit and then gives me a creepy smile and asks ""um.. what were those three points again?"". The three points being the three main points of the class. These points were also on the slide, on the huge screen right in front of him. I tell him as much (""look in front of you, they're on the slide"") and he doesn't even blink or look to said screen. Just keeps giving me the same smile and staring at me. Then he says ""I'm Peter by the way"". 


Ok now I'm not a paranoid person. But the missed call that morning, combined with the name Peter just freaked me out. I start to think ""probably a coincidence. But the missed call this morning.. How would he know I was here though. I decided to sit next to him. Peter's a common name. But he did stare at me, he gives me the creeps. Am I being a big wuss?"" Eventually I decide I'm just reading into things too much. After the 15 min. break (we have breaks in the middle of 2 hour classes) I find a different empty seat, Peter wasn't there yet, and hope that's the end of it. He walks in, sits right besides me and stares at me some more. Super. After class I immediately called up a friend and had lunch with a bunch of other people because I was really freaked out at this point.


That week I got several more of the creeper-calls, which didn't help my paranoia. The week after that I was prepared for class. I came in early, picked out a row that had some people sitting in it. I asked them to stand up (being very annoying, seeing as how entire rows were still empty), walked past them and sat at the very end, next to the wall. I figured he would never ask five people to get up, like I just did, just to sit next to me. I constantly check over my shoulder when I see Peter walk in. He looks around the classroom until he finds me, then starts to walk down the stairs towards my row, right up to the small group I had asked to pass earlier. He asks them something (he spoke softly so I couldn't hear) and points towards the seats between me and them. They get really annoyed and tell him something along the lines of: ""dude just sit here, we don't want to get up again, there are plenty of empty seats"". Admittedly they were a bit douchy to him, but I could've hugged them. Peter just stands there awkwardly, looks around, sees no other seats near me and walks out. I mean, he just walked out of the classroom and left. I later found out he not only skipped class because he couldn't sit next to me, he completely dropped the class. I never saw him again in that classroom. Not sure how to put this as English isn't my main language but the class wasn't optional. Just dropping out is a really bad idea.


This could all be a coincidence. Peter could just have been some shy, awkward guy who wanted to hit on me and got so anguished after embarrassing himself in front of my that he decided to drop out of the class. If that's the case he had some damned bad timing. It was really scary to me at the time. 


The calls continued for a while, I never answered again. After a few months they stopped completely. I still don't answer calls from hidden numbers. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1359767211.0	17q9ex	The persistent police officer	walnutwhale	160	53	21	"So, we're talking about cops now? I have one - less creepy and more hilarious (but probably still a little creepy if you're not as ballsy as I am). Also, this story that lead me to the cop encounter is creepy in its own right, so you're getting a two for one. Yay!

A couple of years ago I was a freelance writer and was doing ANY other spare job I could find to supplement my incredibly inconsistent income. As a fairly talented photographer, I found myself hauling my camera to clubs and photographing the woo girls and bros I encountered there. I described my job as social anthropology, and it gave me an interesting perspective into a subculture I was not familiar with. However, being an attractive young lady with the big camera made me a perfect target for drunk creeps and girls looking for fights... but those are stories for other times.

The company I worked for set up photobooths on the weekends at some of the more ""swanky"" clubs. Camera on a tripod, macbook connected to a monitor so you could see your pics, etc. I manned the laptop and the printer in case people wanted to buy prints of their photobooth pics, but there was a lot of time in between rushes of drunk people so I was always playing around on my phone.

On this particular night I was working at one of the more ""ghetto"" clubs - there was at least two fights a night and people liked to have sex in the bathrooms. I had been playing around on my (brand new) iPhone 4s when a rush of people assaulted the photobooth. I didn't have pockets on my dress, so I wedged it between the printer and the box of photo paper. Out of sight... or so I thought.

A big, bossy girl came to talk to me about buying some prints of the photos she had just taken with her weaselly boyfriend. She shoved a huge stack of sweaty dollar bills in my hand and I turned to sort them and unlock the money box. When I turned back, I immediately noticed something was wrong - my brand new iPhone was missing.

""Did you see who took my phone? Did you see?"" I asked the girl. She shook her head, staring at me innocently. I knew she was lying to my face but I had no proof. I started raising my voice and asking everyone else milling about: Did they see anything? A group of lovely military lesbians latched onto me and started interrogating other people, trying to get my phone back, and the big bossy girl slipped off to her weaselly boyfriend. 

I KNEW it had been the two of them. He had commented on my phone earlier that night ""Oh, is that one of the new iPhones?"" I beckoned over my favorite security guard and pointed them out, and he took them aside to pat them down. I was 99.9% certain she had shoved my phone down her boobs.

But no luck. He wasn't allowed to look down her breasts and she wasn't cooperating anyway. The club security just shrugged it off as ""oh well"". I was filled with blind rage and adrenaline. I had just spent $600 of my own money on that goddamn phone. As a writer, my phone is my LIFE. I collapsed into exhausted tears, determined to get through the rest of the night before I could make my way home and handle this.

Then, the weaselly little gangster ran up to me and started screaming in my face. ""OH, YOU THINK YOU SO GOOD YOU DUMB ASS BITCH? YOU GET OFF ACCUSING ME AND MY WOMAN OF THEFT BECUZ WE BLACK? YOU RACIST ASS HO! YOU RACIST SLUT!"" I stood there blankly, staring him down. He only came up to the bottom of my chin, so I put on my best nonplussed face and stood there until the security guard grabbed him. In reality, my heart was pounding. I was scared. A lot of these people were gang members and shootings within this crowd were not uncommon. But I went back to work, tucking it back in my mind as valuable information (see: guilty behavior)

The moment I got home (at around 3am), I went banshee screaming downstairs to wake up my roommate/best friend and her boyfriend. I explained the situation and they were immediately in Sherlock mode - time to fix this! We set up an information center: I booted up find my iPhone and my roommate sat on hold with the police station. I watched my iPhone travel on the minimap - from the club, to an area known for drugs, and then... out of my city. Waaaay out of my city. An hour south. Dammit.

The cops told me to go within a block of where my phone was and then call them to come intervene. Fine. We did this once at 4am and two young cops showed up. They were very helpful but said they couldn't knock on doors (it was an apartment complex) until at least 9am, and to come back.

Sigh.

Home for a quick nap, then BACK DOWN TO GET MY PHONE! (queue adventure music)

At 9am on the dot I called the cops again and up rolled an older gentleman. I'm not going to lie - he was *gorgeous*. Total ex military silver fox - cropped grey hair and piercing blue eyes. He immediately started joking and flirting with me - it was flattering, but I wasn't interested as he was about the same age as my father. 

I sing him my ringtone (the chocobo theme!) and he decides that he is going to start calling my number as he knocks on doors of the apartment complex to see if it rings from within. I wait in the parking lot. After a few minutes, silver fox cop comes striding back from around the building. He has no expression. ""We should get out of here, this is a bad area and I don't want you to get hurt.""

""But... did you get my phone?"" I ask, my voice quivering.

""Oh... you mean this?"" He asks. Suddenly he's smirking and he pulls my phone from his front pocket and holds it out to me. I snatch it and in complete reflex from this harrowing experience I give him a hug. 

""Oh, sorry!"" I laughed, trying to pull back. He tightened his grip and held it uncomfortably long. ""Oh, I wish I got payment like this more often..."" he purred into my hair. 

Ummm. Okay.

So I disentangle myself from mister cop and thank him, inspecting my phone. Again, he prompts me: ""let's drive around the block so I can tell you more information in case you want to press charges.""

I head for my car and follow him to another parking lot. He opens his door and sits in his driver's seat, eying me as I stand there awkwardly. I begin to try to talk to him about what happened with my phone, but he keeps changing the subject.

""Oof, a hot young redhead like you would be the death of me.""

I giggled nervously. ""So, how do I press charges?""

""We'll get to that in a minute. Have you ever been on a motorcycle? You'd look amazing on the back of mine.""

I had to bite my lip to keep from laughing. It was such a midlife crisis thing for him to say. ""Not since college, sir. Now about my phone...""

Things went on like this for awhile. He kept deterring the conversation to flirty, sexually overt comments and I would steer things back. It was getting annoying. Finally, after he gave me his card with his cell phone number written on it (you can call me anytime, even for things not relating to the case *wink*) I thought it was finally time to part ways. Nope. 

""I sure could go for another one of those hugs.""

Whatever, fine. I hug him and leave. My roommates find the entire situation hilarious, as do I. They make a bunch of jokes about how I should fuck him because he probably gives great head with so much experience, etc. I forget about it. It wasn't that weird - people persistently hit on me pretty frequently.

But then the calls began. Always from a blocked number, always labored breathing. Definitely someone masturbating. Thinking my little brother had posted my number on 4chan again, I ignore them.

I'm a very public internet personality. I have a pretty well known blog. So then the weird anonymous blog comments start. Really, really explicit things. ""I'd part your legs and fuck you til you were raw.""
""Your lips are so perfect, perfect size for my dick.""

Things like that. Again, I think: bitches be trollin'. Unfortunately I'm used to stuff like this.

But then they become more specific.
""I'd fuck you with my night stick.""
""How do you feel about older cock? I could treat you right.""

AND IT ALL MAKES SENSE. Aggressive silver fox has been bizarrely stalking me. Finally, he actually calls me - keep in mind I never gave him my number. Says he can't stop thinking about my ""perfumed red hair"", and would I give an old man a chance. I politely decline, hoping that will be the end of it.

A few calls later where he continues to ask me out (""c'mon, just let me give you a ride on my motorcycle"". ""I bet your boyfriend doesn't treat you right, I have lots of experience."") I finally call him out for the phone calls and blog. He's silent for a moment, and then laughs nervously. ""You have a blog? Cool! I'll have to look it up.""

NOPE.

Luckily, that was the end of it. I laugh about it now, but it was still a little disconcerting at the time to be mildly stalked by a cop. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1354898891.0	14g881	The 4 a.m. Calls		138	33	15	"I've been a lurker lately and I realized that I have quite a creepy story as well. This whole thing started back in 2008 during my senior year in  high school. 

I woke up late one night to my phone ringing. I looked at my clock and wondered who would be calling me at 4 in the morning. The caller ID said it was a private number. Thinking that is was some automated call, I didn't answer and went back to sleep. Whoever it was didn't leave a voice mail, so I didn't think anything of it, until these calls started to come more often. It made me uneasy, but they were so rare, I didn't think too much of it.

During my freshmen year of college, these calls started happening almost every night and always around 4 a.m. I never answered them, just because answering to an unknown number has always creeped me out. And knowing by then, that whoever this was, it definitely wasn't an automated call or anything. 

They started to get adamant. Like, calling 3 to 4 times repeatedly after not answering. I was starting to get pissed off, because I'm a student who has 8 a.m. classes and whoever this is, needs to leave me the fuck alone. So, I finally answer. The first thing I notice is loud rap music in the background. 

""Hello, who is this?""

No response

""Please stop calling me. I think you have the wrong number.""

I hear menacing laughter and incoherent mumbling. Even though I couldn't understand what he was saying, he just sounded....threatening. It still gives me chills thinking about the laughter.
  
""Look, whoever you are, you have the wrong number. STOP CALLING ME."" 
And I hung up. 

I'm thinking this guy is probably drunk or on something because I couldn't understand a word he said. It was just the way he said them. It really creeped me out. I got a gut feeling that this guy was someone I never wanted to meet in person. Ever. And that's when I began to wonder if I had a stalker on my hands. I really became paranoid about it. The calls continued for months. They were so frequent that I ended up turning my phone off at night so I could sleep. I never thought about calling the police because I didn't have a number to go by...I was always really aware of my surroundings from that point on though. Being on the third floor of an apartment helped, but still...it really messed with me. 

During Christmas break that year, I went home to Memphis, TN. It was nice to take a break from school, and just relax. But early one morning, I get a call from the private number again. Except this time, it wasn't 4 a.m. but around 8 or 9. I answer ready to go off on this guy. 

""Who the hell is this? You have the wrong number. Leave me alone.""

Then I hear a deep male voice respond in a demanding way,
""Are you going to meet me?""

This was the only coherent thing I've ever heard from this guy. He sounded like your typical thug, which being from Memphis, isn't the best situation. So, in shock, I respond.

""No. I don't know you.""

In the most menacing voice I've ever heard, he said,
""I know where you live. Be there soon."" *click*

This is the part where I flip the fuck out. I'm in full out panic mode. I rush to my parent's room and wake them up. I'm on the verge of tears and I tell them what happened. Obviously, they're really worried and were on the same brain wave as me-stalker. I'm wondering how this guy could possibly know me. Should we call the police? What would we tell them? My Dad, with his military training, is up immediately and grabs his gun from under the bed. He is on full alert, and starts keeping an eye out for mysterious cars driving around. I was petrified the whole day and sleep definitely wasn't going to happen.

Sorry to be painfully anti-climactic, but thankfully, nothing ever happened that day. I decided if I got another call from him, I would call my phone company to see if they could trace his number and report him to the police. But, the calls just stopped after that. I've haven't gotten a call from him since. I've always wondered if it was someone just messing with me, but from the way he said ""be there soon."" didn't sound like messing. He sounded menacing and threatening. My gut told me I was in trouble. Nothing came of it though. Everything just....stopped.

I can't help but wonder if he thought he was calling someone else. Someone he knew. He was going to go over to that person's house and something bad was going to go down by the way he sounded. I really hope it wasn't some other girl who just happened to sound like me. If it was, I really hope she's okay. The way the calls just stopped completely makes me think otherwise.

1351096935.0	120hgu	Creeper At Closing Time	LaurelSnow1	125	23	13	"I work at a popular family sports bar in a small city in Florida. It's the kind of place where the majority of customers are regulars, and everyone knows everyone else. I've only been working there for 5 months, but nothing weird or out-of-the-norm has happened since I've been there, until last night. 



 We were closing up the place when I noticed a small, white pick-up pulling into our parking lot. I immediately thought that was strange, since I knew none of my coworkers needed a ride and the community knows that we close at 11. As I was sweeping the floors, I could see a guy in his late thirties get out of the truck and pace from one side of it to the other. I thought that was odd, but I wasn't alone and we still had regulars outside talking by their cars, so I sort of shrugged it off and continued to sweep. 


About 20 minutes later, just as we're finishing putting up the chairs and getting ready to clock out, he walks through the front door mumbling to himself. Luckily, the owner was there and asked him, ""Can I help you?"" He responded with something along the lines of, ""Don't even worry about it. Frank's coming. I'm meeting Frank here."" The owner, Bruce, told him ""Sorry buddy. We're closed."" He kind of stared at him with a confused expression and stumbled back out. His walk, talk, and appearance signaled to us that he was either drunk, high or both. Bruce asked my coworkers and I if he had been in the restaurant that night, and we confirmed that he hadn't but had pulled in as we were closing up.


Once he stumbled back out, Bruce locked up all the doors and we finished up, keeping an eye on this guy through the windows. He was outside trying to strike up a conversation with our regulars outside, who blew him off. He then tried to open our doors again with no success  and walked out into the parking lot towards Bruce's car, which was not parked close to his truck. 


 He started looking through Bruce's car windows and banging on his window, and that's when we called the police. We explained that there was a man outside the restaurant that was incoherent, who had apparently driven himself there, trying to get into our restaurant after telling him we were closed. Now he's looking through our car windows and banging on them. While 911 is getting a description from my coworker of this guy, he comes back up to the restaurant and starts pulling repeatedly on the back door, all the while smiling through the window at us.  At one point he and I made eye contact and the look on his face really freaked me out.


 Being a small city with not a lot of crime in the area, within minutes of calling 911 several squad cars showed up in our parking lot. When they arrived, he was still at our back door, tugging and trying to get in. Apparently, he told police that he knew Anne that worked here (no one works there by that name). He also thought he was in a city 40 minutes away from where he actually was and that he worked next door to us even though he did not. He had a hospital bracelet around his wrist and told the police that he had just gotten out of the hospital for a problem with his liver enzymes. I'm not sure if he was doped up on medicine or something else, but it was clear that he was not coherent. 


  Eventually, police used his phone to call family members to pick him up and take him home. Luckily, nothing happened in this situation. After police were finished talking to him, I don't think the guy had malicious intent, but he was acting crazy and still not someone that I would want to have encountered up close. I'm just grateful that the owner was there that night, so it wasn't us girls by ourselves. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1344707498.0	y20cl	Always lock your bedroom windows	Pixilight	130	23	10	"As a child my favourite hobby was growing monarch butterflies from caterpillars in my room. When the leaves on the swan plant dwindled, I went down to the supermarket and bought whole pumpkins for them to feast on. This of course resulted in excessive numbers of engorged caterpillars crawling around my room when they were ready to become chrysalises. I ended up with them everywhere, under my bed, under my desk, in my wardrobe, off the sides of my dressing table, on the curtains etc. 


Our two story house was embedded on a hill in the suburbs on a large section. My room was staggered in between my parents and my sister’s bedroom. Theirs was at ground level and hers was almost at the two story level, mine was somewhere in between. I had large double windows looking out on to part of the yard that lead to the back section and a flat deck that connected to our driveway. I also had a smaller window on a bit of protruding wall on my parent’s side which was about six feet to the ground.  The deck was attached to stairs that lead up to our front door and larger deck that was in an ‘L’ shape going around the lounge and dining area. This looked out over the neighbourhood and down the driveway. Downstairs was a two door garage, a second bathroom, and another windowless room at the back, built into the hill like a bomb shelter which in later years would become my sisters room when she was a teen. The property was surrounded by a two and a half metre high fence, aside from the bottom of our exceptionally long and steep driveway where we didn’t have a gate.

  
One night when I was nine or ten, I was lying in bed, staring at the glow in the dark stars on my ceiling and as usual unable to sleep. The days before the internets. It was the middle of a summer so I had left the windows open with security locks on them so they opened about half a foot in width. My parents were still up, but out in the lounge watching telly with the hallway door closed and my sister was out at a friend’s house for the night. 


I heard a sort of snuffling, grunting noise right outside my side window and I assumed it was a hedgehog or a dog taking itself for a walk. I looked over casually to see my curtain bulging like a breeze had caught it. I had the sudden urge to take a huge pee at that moment so I jumped up and off I went. Coming back from the loo I noticed the curtain was edged to the side by the wind so I wandered over to close it. As I held the curtain, I heard that same grunting noise again directly under the window but it was much louder.  I looked out the window into the darkness but I couldn't see shit so I told whatever it was to ‘Go Home’. It went quiet and I closed the curtain and went back to sleep. 


The next morning I rolled out of bed and opened my curtains and I immediately noticed several squashed chrysalises on my inner window ledge. I was a bit distraught and blamed myself for their deaths because I had let the wind blow them off. I decided to keep that window shut from then on. 


Several nights later the police showed up at our door step as there had been reports of a prowler by a neighbour a few doors down. He had tried to get in through their window. As far as I know they didn't catch him.


I didn't even think about it until years later, well after we had moved from there when Mum brought the story up about a prowler in the neighbourhood. I realized then what might of happened had I not locked the windows. I never told her about it.


TLDR;Prowler tries to come in my bedroom window, saved by deadlocks and dead butterflies.

1341960095.0	wcpys	Is Mary Home?	msdmg17	118	13	37	"First post here. When I stumbled across this subreddit I knew I had to post my story(sorry it is a little long)! This takes place over the course of a few months and I have yet to stop wondering whether I am still being watched. . .  
        


 This is the first year I have ever been away from home; I recently graduated high school and moved away to college. It was just another day, I was riding my bike back home to my apartment which was only a block away, and I made it back without any incidents as usual. I locked my bike up and as I turned around I noticed a guy who looked a few years older than me casually leaning against the wall staring right at me. I smiled to be polite however I felt my stomach drop as this immense feeling that something was very off about this guy. It was nothing to do with his appearance, he was a pretty average looking guy, but there was something about his demeanor that emanated an overall bad-creeper-up to no good kind of vibe. 

He began to make small talk with me which was fine until he said one seemingly innocent remark that haunted me for the rest of the day: I've seen you around a few times. I was taken aback. I have never seen this guy around campus nor my apartment complex, and to add to the ""creepy"" factor he mentioned he had only just moved in downstairs about a week before. He then began to ask me for my number, and I politely declined and told him I had a boyfriend. He was persistent though so I quickly welcomed him to the apartment complex and made an excuse to leave. I made my way upstairs, where he watched my every move never lifting his stare. I told my roommates about what happened, and the incident was forgotten. 
      
  

About a month later as I was coming back home from dinner with my roommates I noticed the very same guy lurking in the same place where I had my first encounter from him. He was hidden partially by shadows since my apartment complex is a piece of shit and won't install proper lighting under stairways or anywhere for that matter. Instantly I hastened my pace and grabbed my keys from my purse hurrying my roommates the entire time joking around that we were going to miss our favorite TV show (which was true) and quickly I locked the door behind us. One of my roommates noticed him lurking around and mentioned that perhaps he was the one responsible for the series of bike thefts that had been going on lately. It was then that I mentioned that was the same guy from a month earlier. We called the police and that was that, I never knew if they interrogated him or if he disappeared before they arrived.
        
 

 I thought that was the end of that. I was very wrong. About a month and a half later I left my apartment with a friend to go throw out the trash while my roommate stayed back cleaning up the kitchen. My stomach dropped with the first step I took out the door. There he was standing in the same spot as usual, looming. I made absolutely no attempt to acknowledge his presence and am glad my friend was completely oblivious to the weird creeper hanging out at the bike racks. Part of me was on edge, and the other was telling myself to ""relax because it's daylight."" The trip to the garbage and back up the stairs did not take more than five minutes. As I went to open the door I noticed it was locked. I almost lost it! I began to violently knock on the door and tried to desperately open the door. My roommate had not locked the door when we left the apartment and my mind automatically went to thinking that this creep could be in there with my roommate and she is in danger. 

I was so relieved when my roommate opened the door and let us in, but the expression on her face did NOT put me at ease. She looked shaken up and was unusually quiet. When I asked what happened she began to say that while she was cleaning up, she heard the doorknob quietly turn. At first she thought we had forgotten something until the door began to open ever so slowly. The body of a man appeared through the doorway: it was him. She yelled at him asking what he wanted. He was clearly surprised (not expecting anyone to be home surely) and stuttered out a ""Is Mary home?"" She firmly told him there was no ""Mary"" here and he needed to leave. He stumbled out and she ran to the door to lock it. I was almost in tears. This was the furthest it has ever gone. This guy stepped foot into my apartment. 
       
  

I am so thankful that the final encounter did not escalate any farther. I often wonder what would have happened if my roommate was back in her room. What would he have done then? I now constantly am locking doors and checking my surroundings every where I go. I have no longer seen this stranger since and I have moved back home for the summer until school resumes again.

1341858943.0	wa6rg	Walking home from school....he started to follow me. 	deweywebber	118	16	7	"In middle school I used to walk home from school with two other friends nearly every day. Our walk would take us along one of the more congested roads through most of our 2 mile walk but towards the end, as we got near our neighborhood, we would cut through an industrial area that lead to a small trek of woods near a canal and dirt road that lead up towards the back entrance area of our neighborhood. 
One day I had to make this walk on my own which was no big deal. As I got toward the area where you would leave the main street walk way and cut through the industrial area, I noticed a guy just hanging out around the cut off area. I never seen him before and since my 'hood was really small, I knew he wasn't from anywhere I lived. I sort of adjusted my direction that would lead me a little further away from him by still in the general direction of my normal short cut. 

As I adjusted my walking direction I noticed that the guy had begun to follow along behind me- maybe 100 ft or so. Just before going down the dirt road there is one building where we'd usually duck inside to get water from their fountains. I went inside quickly so I could get a drink but also try and figure out where the hell this guy was going. As I left the building and walked around to the back of it where the dirt road started I noticed he was about half way down the dirt road just standing there. He was ""acting"" like he was looking out over the canal area and just standing there. If I was going to get home, I was going to have to walk down the dirt road and past him. I slowly made my way down this slight embankment and had all kinds of wild thoughts running through my head ""Can I out run him?""  ""Should I grab a rock?"" ""What should I do if he attempts to grab me?""  ....I made it maybe 20 steps toward him when I heard a car horn honking back behind me. I spun around and there was my dad waving at me. I turned around and jogged up to his car. My dad didn't live with me. My parents were divorced and he lived about 10 miles away. He just happened to be driving down the main road that day and saw me walking home from school. When he turned his car around to come give me a ride home, he lost track of where I went so on a whim he drown down this dirt road to see me as I was starting to walk toward this guy....As I got in my dads car, that strange guy looked up toward where we were and started walking back in our direction. He didn't continue down that path toward my neighborhood and I never seen him again.  I often think about telling my dad about this story and how I think he saved my life that day. Well, maybe. Who knows.

1340337335.0	vf428	A creep in my backyard	Brooklynnn88	122	18	21	"It was St. Patrick's day of 2011 and I'd just gone out for beer and wings at a local pub with some friends. I didn't feel like staying out too late because I had class early in the morning the following day. I had maybe 2 or 3 bottles of beer over the course of the night, and was mildly buzzed but nowhere near drunk. Because everyone else planned to stay out much later than me, I walked home alone around midnight, which wasn't a huge deal because I only lived about 5 minutes away. At the time, I was living in a small basement apartment in a quiet, residential neighborhood. I went into my bedroom, which had a small window near the ceiling that faced the backyard. Outside of the window, the ground was dug-out and there were some large items belonging to the backyard pool (which was out of service for the winter) stacked around the brick wall. 

I turned on the light in my room and started to get changed. I was completely naked and facing toward the window. I glanced up and saw what I thought to be the reflection of my face in the window. I glanced away, thinking nothing of it at first, but then I felt like something really wasn't right. I looked up again, and took a closer look at the face in the window. My eyes widened and I tried to awaken slightly from the alcohol buzz. I looked closer, and realized that the face was moving around in a way that did not mirror my own movements. Also, the face was smiling and speaking. I realized there was a young man who must have literally trespassed into the backyard, maneuvered himself behind all of the pool supplies, and crouched down in the dug-out area outside of the window.

I FREAKED THE FUCK OUT and promptly grabbed a blanket to cover myself and then ran into the living room. I was home alone, so I called one of my roommates, who attempted to convince me that I must have been imagining it because I was drunk. I'm not sure what was worse; seeing what I saw or not being believed about it.

The other crappy part is that the next day when I told my classmates, they laughed at me and were high-fiving each other and being like ""Bro, that's hilarious"" :\

Scary and awful."	t5_2t3t8	True
1374449960.0	1is0qg	I hope he doesn't come back...	Falleni	147	44	22	"I didn't know where else to post this, but I have to get it off my chest:

2AM last night I was in the car with my girlfriend heading back to my place to drop her off to her car. I notice a car parked on the side of the road by the stop sign of our street. It didn't look like anyone was in it so I just ignored it. We continue down into the end of our road and pull into my driveway. I walk her to her car and kiss her goodbye. 

Minutes later she calls me panicking, ""Someone is following me! He's trying to hit the back of my car! Help!"" I swing the door open to my room and hurdle down stairs to my car in the garage. I floor it and find out where she was. Sure enough it was the car that was parked by the stop sign. The guy was right behind her car weaving trying to get beside her and almost hitting her car. I quickly jot down his license plate and speed up behind him. I pull beside him and act like I'm going to ram him off the road. He pulls his car over slowly and I slow down to get a good look at him. He was smiling with his eyes at me in a ski mask. 

I start calling the cops while I'm following my girlfriend who is now calming down on the phone. I look in the rear view mirror and see him turn around slowly and go into the opposite direction. The cops show up and I tell them everything, but there's not much they can do at that point. He knows where I live... I hope he doesn't come back... "	t5_2t3t8	True
1369868523.0	1fatcx	The first day of university.	lk09nni	124	20	13	"We all saw he wasn't like us, from the very start. His posture was different, his smell was pungent and heavy, his gaze was either right in the base of your skull or all across the room. But it was our first day at the university, we were all very happy to get into this very prestigious science program, and we were all very nervous about coming across as weird ourselves.

I tend to have an open mind about eccentric people, I mean, I am a comparatively young blonde woman but I am still in the science field. There's a lot of extremely intelligent but kooky professor-types out there, and in the start there was nothing to suggest this guy would be any different. 

I first talked to him in the afternoon of the first day. There were some introductory activities where we were placed in small groups and were to play name-games and such in order to get to know each other. I presented myself, like you do, and was all friendly and polite, like you are. I found out he was a master chess player and thought that was kind of cool, and I told him a little about myself, too. He was really keen on finding out my home address for some reason, but I didn't think much of it. 

I think my first mistake was that I decided to go outside and have a cigarette with him. Damn, i know smoking is bad for you and all, and I don't do it that often, but when you're nervous and looking for an opportunity to have some casual conversation with new people, it's just so practical to have something simple like that in common. It was near impossible to have a conversation with this guy though. He just couldn't keep track of what he was saying, and he kept echoing my words for some reason. And he really had a strange smell to him - a thick, sour odor that wasn't really sweat, or dirt, or smoke, or breath. 

I've since spoken to the old, weathered nurses who work in the psychiatric department of my hospital, and they would have sworn under oath that they could smell schizophrenia before even talking to a new patient. I guess that must have been the smell. I saw that his hands had been all busted up, too, and asked him about it, but the conversation trailed off. 

Our little group had all exchanged phone numbers and e-mail addresses, like you do, and the first time he called me was because he had trouble getting into his new university account. ""They rewired it"", he said. I said I didn't know what he was talking about and asked him to call the IT-department instead. ""No, I can't do that, they don't want me at their university so they rewired my account, just to mock me!"".

The next day I tried to avoid him, but he kept following me around like a little dog in a huge blazer, carrying an enormous bag, full of books that kept falling out on the floor. I felt sorry for the awkward guy so I didn't really tell him to fuck off at first, but I really started to feel uncomfortable when he put his hand high up on my thigh during a lecture. ""Please don't touch me"", I said as politely as I could, and saw some strange kind of flicker of electricity passing through his eyes. 

At the time, I was working as an aid to a handicapped girl who sometimes had trouble breathing during the night. An awesome job, most nights she only needed help once or twice, so I could stay up and browse the internet for a good hourly salary. I had the night shift, so that day I just passed by my little student room quickly, picked up my stuff and left for work. 

I got his first text message just as I got on the bus to work. It wasn't much, just a simple ""can we meet tonight?"". I didn't reply. Ten minutes later, the phone rang. I didn't reply. Almost twenty minutes later, I got that little text message saying I had voicemail, and that it was a 20 minute long voicemail. Then a text message again. ""I'm outside your place, can we meet?"". And then a phone call. And another. And another. And another. I let each one go to voicemail, and each one led to a 20-minute long recording that I didn't dare listen to.

I was a bit shook up but the girl I was working for was cool about it, we had a laugh, I had a coffee, turned off my phone and helped her get to bed. 

After she was OK I sat down to check my mail. I already had three new e-mails. All from him. They were short and practically incomprehensible, but seemed to alternately express a desire to ""end our relationship and concentrate on school"", ""go to New York together"", and ""lose everything like Romeo and Juliet"", anger for me having ""not opened the door"" and ""turned off my phone"". No real threats, though, apart from him saying that he would kill himself if he couldn't be with me. Which most definitely was serious enough. 

I didn't do much that night apart from sitting in front of my computer, seeing e-mails drop in every five minutes until five AM. After that, they stopped, so I figured he had gone to sleep and had the guts to finally listen to my voicemail.

They were filled with the same type of ramblings, what sounded like a sincere man breaking up with someone, intertwined with stuttering, animal-like yells and tiny little whimpers. I swear that everyone I let listen to these recordings would go ashen and say it was the creepiest thing they ever heard.  

I realized I had to do something but didn't really know if I should call the police, or the hospital, or what. But I remembered that a university psychiatrist had been present during our first introductory days and told us to contact her if we ever needed to talk about anything. So I sent her an email explaining the situation, hoping she could tell me what to say or do.

This amazing woman sent me a response at 7 am, even before I had ended my shift. She told to stay home from school that day, and that she would try to set up a meeting with this guy to see what was up. I felt really off and unsafe, so I went to stay over at a friends house. Later that day I got an email from the psychiatrist telling me that the guy was ill and had been taken to the hospital, all was OK and I could go back to school the next day. 

I went back home and saw that the electric code-lock had been bashed up with some sort of a blunt object, nobody seemed to know by whom.

I found out later that the psychiatrist had managed to pull a few strings with the university administration so that the start of his program would be postponed for a year. They couldn't kick him out, I mean, he got into the program fair and square, but they got him to agree on that he'd have to wait until he was feeling better.

I had almost forgotten about him until I saw him on campus a year later. I spotted him from miles away and think I managed to sneak off track before he saw me. And I got one last  e-mail, with a simple ""how are you?"" that I didn't reply to. 

But what really freaked me out was that I later heard that the psychiatrist had called for an emergency meeting with all of the students in the grade below me. I only heard this as rumors, but reportedly she had told them that a special student was going to start with them and that they were NOT to talk to him or interact with him for any reason. The university was going to do all they could to get him off the program, but they had no legal possibility to just kick him out. He was to be considered very dangerous, and they were to contact her if they heard anything from him at all.

I moved out from my little apartment soon thereafter. It just didn't feel OK to stay. And I deleted my Facebook. And I still look around me before I sit down in the bus, or subway, or lecture-hall. It's not such a big city after all.

I am a very paranoid woman, always casing my surroundings, so it didn't take me long to notice the lone man skulking around some buildings across the road. 

I'd never seen any traffic in, out, or around the building, so I immediately knew he was ""up to something."" Sure enough, he was walking around the perimeter, now behind a corner, now hesitantly skirting a wall once again in my view. I am still sitting on the bench, by this time looking for any oncoming traffic or people that might come into view. The street is completely dead. No cars have passed between me and the buildings for many minutes and there are no pedestrians as far as the eye can see.

Of course, if I know this, he knows it too, and it is in this atmosphere of isolation that he finally stops stalking the grounds, chooses a cozy spot directly in my line of vision, puts his back to the brick wall and proceeds to draw out his penis while leisurely masturbating while

I didn't have very long to make a decision. I took one last look around the area, confirmed that I was absolutely alone, and weighed my options. Some might try to pretend it wasn't happening and ""ignore"" him. Obviously that's what he was counting on. However, as I err on the side of caution, I calculated that it was safest to address the problem head-on. Without hesitation I rose from the bench, pulled myself up to my full height of 5'5"", and began striding purposefully toward him with my fists ready. 

Thankfully I had measured him correctly as an utter coward and he split quicker than you can say ""pull up your shorts.""

1365562043.0	1c1crn	Ordinary late night bus ride becomes Greyhound groping.	shraaaamps	126	25	15	"So I've been a long time lurker, eventually made an account but never felt like I had anything worth sharing until I came across this subreddit a couple days ago. 

This happened about 2 years back in 2011, but it had to have been the first time I had a personal experience with a creeper and the details of the incident just stuck with me so vividly. A little background, I go to school out of my hometown so I commute via Greyhound, Go Bus etc to go home on weekends/holidays. 

I usually left in the afternoon but this particular Friday, I found myself bussing to the Greyhound Terminal (which was further downtown) in the late evening. I wouldn't have been in the city until almost about 11 pm- 12 am. Outside of the University and it's periphery of about 13 km,  was pretty sketchy. Aside from a few homeless guys or drunkies, I had never thought much of it before.

As I was boarding the bus, I noticed there weren't too many people but we were the first stop so I wasn't worried. I settled in my seat, got comfortable and was about to pop in my earphones when an asian male (looked about late 20s) donning a grey overcoat 2 sizes too big asked if the seat next to me had been taken and if he could sit there. I took a quick glance around the bus and noticed that most of seats were empty. I immediately got an uneasy feeling about this guy but I reluctantly agreed to just let him sit next to me. 

After adjusting into his seat, he started up a conversation. Fairly general questions, nothing that really struck me as creepy. I noticed throughout our short talk, he would not make eye contact with me but was sitting uncomfortably close. Eventually his questions got too personal, and after a draining week, I really didn't want to muster the energy to keep this conversation going. Slowly, I turned to face the window which was entirely darkness, given the occasional streetlight and other vehicles on the road (we hadn't made it to the main highway yet, so we were still commuting through the smaller towns picking up passengers). He made no further attempts to talk but the light above our seat was on, so when the window was dark, I would catch his reflection and every time he was facing me. 

I soon placed him further and further in my mind and let the the flow of Yiruma's melodies drift me off to sleep. Biggest fucking mistake. I woke up from a warm moist feeling on my left thigh. I was still groggy, but I felt as if the warmth was something foreign, something unfamiliar to me. My eyes snapped open, and this motherfucker had his grimy hand on my upper inner left thigh. I was wearing leggings too, so he copped a nice long feel that sick fuck. At this point, I had slept for quite some time (the commute to the city was a couple of hrs) and the bus had filled up to a fair amount of people, particularly for this time of night. This sneaky dirtbag had taken out his laptop, and rested it on his leg to conceal the fact that his right hand was placed on my thigh. Judging from the warmth and moistness of that spot on my thigh, it made sick to know how long his hand must have been there. As soon as it had occurred to him that I was awake and had turned my head to face him, he quickly slipped his hand underneath his laptop before I could say anything, all the while maintaining eye contact with me. 

My initial reaction was confusion, as I had just woken up, which became fear, but that was quickly overcome by anger. I gathered my stuff, stood up, and said, ""I don't know what you were trying to do, but don't you ever fucking touch me again."" I didn't sound as angry as I had hoped, but it was enough to garner attention from other passengers and to get my point across. The moment that I had started to get up and open my mouth, he had immediately pretended to be asleep. At which point, I didn't care, I said what I needed to say and I stumbled onto another available seat a few aisles down. 

As soon as I had taken place in my new seat (I sat on the opposite side, but he was still in my view), my heartbeat immediately began to race. It was like the sudden rush of adrenaline and anger I previously had just a short moment ago, completely disappeared. I felt helpless and scared at the thought of what he had already done and thought about doing if I had kept sleeping. As soon as we arrived at the terminal downtown, I rushed to the subway station below and felt a bit of relief knowing that I would be home soon. My heart instantly skipped a beat when I looked across to the other side, and saw him standing there in his overcoat, with his laptop bag to the side and the same solemn expression painted on his face, just looking in my direction. I turned away until my subway train finally came and I hopped on. 

Sorry for the wall of text, hope you all enjoy reading about my Greyhound experience. 

TLDR; Creepy guy in large overcoat sat next to me on empty bus, I fell asleep, his nasty grimy hand copped a nice long feel on my upper inner thigh. Told him off, spent rest of way home in fear.

1364749444.0	1bd5xb	"The ""Nice"" Guy"	justanothergirltohim	134	30	28	"This story happened when I was 21. I went out one night with a group of friends. After the bars had closed we walked back to one of the guy's houses. My friend, and also designated driver, decided that she was too drunk to drive. She said she'd wait it out and sober up a bit. While ""sobering up"" she ended up going off with a guy she liked and hooking up (even though she had a husband and child at home).

She left me with four guys, who I would say were no more than acquaintances. One guy passed out, two others were busy watching a movie, and another made me a drink. Now, by this point I didn't feel that drunk, but definitely a buzz. I told him I didn't want another drink but he kept insisting. I had a few sips before going off to the bathroom. When I was in the bathroom, I started feeling really light-headed and drunk. I thought it was weird, considering I had just felt fine, and only had a few sips of the drink he made me.

After a few minutes, I walked out, with a plan of trying to find my friend. The guy who made me the drink had other plans. He grabbed me as soon as I walked out of the bathroom. He pulled me into a bedroom and was undressing me before I even realized what was going on. I told him ""no"" a few times and he told me to ""relax"" and ""enjoy it."" I tried to fight back and I remember his hand on my neck at one point. I must have blacked out because I only remember part of it. 

After it was over he told me that I was ""good,"" and asked if I wanted to stay over. I quickly left and found my friend who was surprised that I hooked up with him (I'm not one for random hook-ups like her). I told her what happened and she said, ""Eh, you were both drunk. Shit happens."" For like a week straight, I had to wear scarfs to cover up my neck, which was completely bruised.

I had another encounter with him last year, if anyone is interested I'll post part 2. Obviously I don't talk to any of those guys or my so-called ""friend,"" anymore, who all took his side. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1363713103.0	1alpm3	That shining, gold tooth.	Postry	122	19	24	"So, this happened about 10 years ago, when I was roughly 9 years old. My mother and I went everywhere together, since she was a single parent. We attracted a lot of attention at times in public places; she was young and gorgeous, with silky black hair, pale skin and light brown eyes. I however, was her little shadow, with a shock of long blonde hair, rosy cheeks and blue eyes. Being that she looked much younger than she was, people would often ask if she was ""babysitting,"" or some of the more brazen folks would ask if I was adopted since we are so different looking. Since she and I have pretty much been on our own my whole life, she always taught me to be wary of strangers and keep an eye out for anything out of place. We've had some other weird incidents happen to us in the past (which I may also post).


Anywho, she and I had been driving home from my music lesson one Friday, which was usually at the local junior high school, but this time, due to a change in my teacher's schedule, was at a junior high school across town pretty far from our suburb. So, as we were on our way back, it was getting pretty dark, being that it was late fall and the sun was setting much earlier than usual. Mom glanced at her dashboard and groaned – we were almost out of gas. She resigns to pull over at the nearest gas station and fill up just enough for us to get home. Ho hum, nothing unusual. She goes to pay, and – ""Ugh, are you serious?"" I hear her say through the window. The outside card reader isn't working. Not wanting to leave me outside, she locked up the car and took me inside to pay the cashier. She even promises I can go and pick out a snack.


The sleeping man at the cash register is obviously not prepared for this at the end of the day. He mumbles, then snaps awake and nearly falls out of his chair, with a jumbled ""Sorry, ma'am, how may I help you?"" (I'm sure her being beautiful didn't really hurt in this case). He starts talking to her about her day, and I let the voices fade into the background while I stare at the treasure trove before me that is gas station junk food. To a 9 year old with about 32 sweet teeth, it's heaven. Hmmm..... Chocolate bar? Crunchy chips? Sour morsels? What to choose, what to choose. I am so lost in a reverie of excitement I almost fail to hear the bell over the shop door ring. Almost. 


In lilts an African-American man, who almost seems to walk with a kind of limp. Were he standing up fully, I'd gander he was maybe 6 feet tall. He stops in the doorway, looks first at mom as she is perusing the magazine rack, then at me. His gait changes, something in his eyes seems to sharpen and he makes a beeline in my direction. He immediately begins to talk to me. ""Well hello there, little one,"" he drawls. ""You pickin' yourself out somethin' tasty?"" I stiffen a bit, but there's no harm done yet, he's just being friendly. ""Yes sir,"" I say. In all her motherly instinct, mom walks closer to me from across the tiny shop and puts her hand on my shoulder. ""Looks like your momma taught you well, sayin' 'yes sir' like that. Now where you headed?"" I say ""Home, sir."" He makes a noncommittal shrug as he turns over his shoulder, I notice he is looking in the direction of our car parked outside. ""Now, where would your daddy be?"" He glances down to mom's hand on my shoulder just in time to see the absence of a wedding ring. I feel her bristle unconsciously. ""He's home waiting for us,"" she lies. ""It was nice talking to you."" I snatch a pack of bubblegum from the shelf quickly as she turns me toward the cashier and pays, one arm still around me. The oblivious cashier bids us a nice evening and I turn to see the man standing there, smiling at me, ear to ear with a wide grin. On his front right tooth is a shining, gold cap that caught the fluorescents just right. I had never seen a gold cap on a front tooth and was stunned. I was out the door as quickly as I'd seen it, and hurried to the car with mom, the gold tooth still gleaming in my mind. 


As soon as we got in, mom locked the doors, as she is accustomed to, and said ""Well that guy was a little creepy,"" with a giggle. We quickly forgot about him and set on our merry way home while I smacked my bubblegum happily. It was early evening and almost dark. By the time we got across town and back to our sleepy, wooded suburb, it was dark out and a half hour later. Mom had a late-night shuttle party to attend (she works for NASA), and my 19-year-old aunt Paige had been dropped off and waiting inside for us so she could watch me, since the party would run late. Mom kissed me goodbye, gave Paige the usual run-down of ""Make sure she bathes and brushes her teeth,"" and was on her way.


So, it's a normal evening. Paige is watching reruns of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and I'm in my pajamas already, playing Pokemon Crystal on my Gameboy, still masticating a wad of pink, sticky bubblegum that must've accrued 7 or so pieces. Then, out of nowhere, the doorbell rings. 


It is about 8 o'clock at night and pitch black outside, and I hear Paige grumble about ""who the hell comes around at this hour?"" while telling me to go see who it is. I get to the door and peek outside the little window to the left to see who it is. It is an African-American man, about 6' with a heavy coat on – a little odd for Texas, even in the fall. In the darkness I can't see his face too well, but I do see a nondescript van parked in our driveway behind him. Since there are no curtains in this window, he sees me almost immediately and says ""Hello there, would you open the door for a minute? I want to ask you something,"" in a heavy drawl. As I hear Paige walking up behind me to the door, I see him smile. Not just a smile, but his lips curl back, and even in the dim light, I see a shining, gold tooth gleaming almost unnaturally before me. 


He is the man from the gas station. In my 9 year old mind, I am dumbstruck, very confused, but also instinctively afraid. Something about seeing that tooth set me off and as Paige opens the door a sliver I slam it shut, turn the deadbolt and yell ""I'm sorry, you have to go away now!"" He looked surprised to see Paige standing behind me for that split second the door was open, but I wasted no time in moving. I grabbed her hand and yanked her into the hallway, out of sight, where she was about to give me the mother of all talking-to's. ""What the hell was that for, dummy? He was just a man at the door! What were you thinking?""


Of course I breathlessly try to explain the gas-station and the creepy vibe, but all that is lost on her as she sighs, noogies my hair, and returns to her shows on the couch. I called mom and told her what happened, and she came home immediately. I am lucky to have a mom that trusted my instincts. We all got little sleep that night, but we still never heard from the man with the gold tooth again. 


It was not until a little later that mom and I started to piece together some of the implications. While the idealistic 9 year old me tried to say ""well maybe I was mean.... maybe it was a coincidence that he turned up here,"" I remembered the gas station we stopped at was 30 minutes across town. I also noticed there were no other cars in the driveway, and he had not seen Paige at all until she opened the door. If he had been waiting near our house, he would have seen my mom leave and thought I was home alone. The fact that behind our back yard is nothing but a huge open field with tall grass also made for a stomach-turning coincidence. The gas station, the conversation, the van, the distance, the heavy coat – it all made me feel so uneasy.


And to this day, that shining, gold tooth is still etched in my memory. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1360474082.0	188ft9	Lives in the same apartment complex...	jeridanielle	129	26	21	"Backstory: I am in my fourth year of undergrad (traditional student, now 22 - was 21 last semester when this all began).  I work in the college Women's Center and I am officer in a few student-run clubs, including the LGBT-focused club. The first weekend of each semester (""Welcome Weekend"") consists of orientation activities for students new to campus and training for student workers.  I may forget a few details since I'm recalling a lot from last semester.

Welcome Weekend last Fall:  I'm working an event that consists of one-act plays that are supposed to give students some basic information on situations such as bullying/harassment, sexual assault, and suicide.  The harassment skit touches on anti-LGBT bullying, after which a co-worker or myself tell the students about resources on campus like the Women's Center and the LGBT club.  Afterward, I am sitting at a table with pamphlets and an older male, non-traditional student approaches and starts talking.  I quickly find out that he has a history of drug abuse, and he lingers and chats until I excuse myself to help with the next round of plays.

During the first week of class, the Women's Center hosts an ice cream social and later a pizza party.  He shows up to both events and talks to me while I try to maintain friendliness.  At one point, he insinuates something about me living in a dorm, so I correct him and tell him I live off-campus.  He asks where, and being a horrible liar/unable to think on my feet/unaware of impending creep, I tell him the street.  He basically says, ""No way me, too!"" and asks where, and again with my horrible foresight I tell him it's a weird shaped complex, to find out he lives in the same one.  He proceeds to joke about me having ""wild parties"" and how he'll have to come ""bang on my door"" or call the police, and at one point says something about seeing or hearing my bathroom (the complex is small and shaped like a U).  After he leaves, a few coworkers talk about getting a creepy vibe from him, and another coworker tells me about how he would linger at her post during her summer job on campus and basically told her about his anger management issues.

Another night during the first week of class, the student government hosts a ""club craze"" event.  Given my officer positions, I tabled at the event.  About midway through the event, I spot him from a distance and freak out a little, telling my co-officers that I saw him and want to avoid him so I go and walk around and visit other club tables.  While I'm writing my e-mail on a club list, he lurks near and says, ""traitor!""  I'm stuck.  I step into a cordial role and try to conduct small talk.  I'm getting antsy and tell him I should get back to my club table, when he says, ""you can leave whenever you want, women always leave me.""  I'm just like T_T and for some reason feel obligated to not just leave him.  Eventually I manage to move back in the direction of my table, but he follows me and lingers for a good 10 minutes until a friend creates a diversion for me to get away.  A bit later, however, he finds me again, and again I'm stuck.  Since it's nearing the end of the event, he talks about walking home, and basically asks me to go with him while telling me he'll protect me.  I tell him that I rode with a friend and I need to stay and help take stuff down.

He finds me on Facebook a couple days later (my name is not common) and sends me this message: ""hi there i hope your having a great weekend it was nice to see you on thursday so don't do anything i would not do"".  A couple days later, some friends come by my complex to pick me up so we can go thrift shopping.  As I walk by his door (absolutely impossible to avoid in order to access my door, coming or going) he steps out on his porch and greets me.  I throw a quick ""fine"" and get into the car.  Later, I come home to a facebook message from him, ""hi there i hope everything is ok if by chance i get on your nerves or if i do or say something that crosses any lines just tell me,"" to which I responded, ""i'm just not comfortable being friends really"".

Throughout the semester, I heard from my boss that he would regularly stop by my boss's office for no evident reason.  When my boss was out, he apparently yelled at other staff members, claiming that my boss ""isn't doing his job"".  Even after my boss tried to talk with him and tell him that he (my boss) couldn't be his (creeper's) counselor, he continued to lurk around my boss's office.

From the time club meetings started, he attended the meetings of the LGBT club.  He would usually stand by the door, and sometimes speak up about something or other.  Before the election, a volunteer for Obama came in to speak about the importance of voting and asked for volunteers for phoning.  He tried to battle the volunteer, belittling them by saying stuff about local politics.  When no one agreed with him, he got in a weird fluster and left.  Later, the entire club received and e-mail from him ""apologizing"" while still arguing his point.

Sometime after midterms, he apparently became very disgruntled with the club and sent another e-mail, though this time just to the officers (though we suspect he might have intended it to go to everyone).  In the message, he attempted to ""call us out"" by talking of himself as an adult who speaks his mind and saying we never took his thoughts into consideration, and said that we ""intentionally excluded him""/""never made an effort to include him"" at events.  At some point he claimed that he had ""gone through more than any of you [us] will ever go through"".

That right there is what tipped the scale for me.  As a survivor of multiple sexual assault incidents, I was furious.  I responded to him (while BCC'ing my co-officers) calling him out in turn by telling him that making such a claim is egotistical bullshit and totally ignorant of other peoples' situations.  I proceeded to tell him that he obviously isn't aware of how he comes off: creepy, and that constantly creeping around my boss's office is unnacceptable.  I ended the e-mail saying to not bother responding because I wouldn't read it.

Of course he responded, and of course I read it.  He tried to re-assert his horrible past and insist that what he does around my boss's office is none of my business.  I deleted it all and put the whole thing away.  For the rest of the semester, if we crossed paths I would ignore him/treat him like any other stranger in the crowd.  He didn't come to another meeting of my club, but apparently he continued lurking around my boss.

I haven't thought much about this whole situation until recently.  Late semester, I came home at one point to my windshield smashed.  It obviously wasn't an act of nature, it definitely looked intentional.  I reported it, had my windshield replaced, and moved on.  Just the other day, however, I came home to see the passenger sideview mirror broken off and nowhere in sight.  I open my vehicle and see the glovebox open, things strewn everywhere, and my rearview mirror detached and laying on the dashboard.  I again reported it, and I assumed nothing valuable was missing since I don't keep valuables in the vehicle, but when the officers asked for my registration I couldn't find the wallet thing in which I keep it.  While I've lived here, no other car in the complex lot has been vandalized or subjected to criminal mischief, so now I'm suspicious.

TL;DR: Stephen B., 47m, is creepy, has admitted to anger issues, and may have vandalized my vehicle."	t5_2t3t8	True
1353762332.0	13pnvw	Two-faced infatuation 	Onetwothree5	134	30	4	My girlfriend and I were living in this shared house about 2 years ago when we were in college. It was a nice place and we knew all the people living there till the manger opened up the farthest back room and rented out to a creeper. My girlfriend and I lived on the second floor so we never saw him inside the house, just outside interactions. One day I go out back to smoke. He comes out and I say hello. He ignores me. I begin to notice all his windows have been covered with black window tint. His apartment is littered with trash even though he lives closest to he garbage can. I pay no mind. Until my gf tells me she was invited to hang out with the guy. She met him while taking out he trash and he seemed really nice. I told her my experience and she thought I came off wrong. So fast toward to that night. We both head over to greet him properly. However, she never told him I was coming or that we were a couple. When he sees me, I can tell he immediately was upset. He begrudgingly lets me in but warmly welcomes her. Inside I see roses spread around and candles lit. It's seemed romantic. He lets us sit and we talk a bit. He is very engaging with her but stone faced and callous with me. He starts to try way too hard to impress her with facts or knowledge of w/e topic we came across. I begin to get how he might have a crush on her. I ask to use the bathroom and he points to a door without looking at me. But several mins after my gf goes to use the same bathroom and he stops her and insists she uses the one in the master bedroom ( his personal bathroom). This creeps my gf out and we leave right away. If this wasn't odd enough apparently when I was in the bathroom, the guy just stared at her smiling, neither of them talking. After this incident we never tried to interact win him again and he moved out a year later. We did find out after the incident from other people living there that this also happened. He'd be nice to women but mean to the guys. He even treated girls with a bf worse than the guy. 	t5_2t3t8	True

 Please forgive my writing style I haven't got much sleep the past few days and this is kind of a rambling vent. I love this subreddit also. Far more scary then a lot of true paranormal stuff.


 I've played World of Warcraft (or WoW) for a few years. Yes there are hazards of being a female player such as lewd comments and what not but I rarely if ever encountered that. I suppose I was lucky to have involved myself with people who respect a person's playing skills instead of focusing on their sex. I used to play on a pure PvP server (Player vs Player) but myself and a friend decided to change things up. Being a fan of D&amp;D etc we decided two years ago to move to an RPPvP server to test the waters of WoW RP. It was a big mistake. 


 Every server has its own unique community and we made friends quickly with some great people. We joined a guild and became active contributors. it all seemed normal if not far more relaxed then the competitive sharp edge of a PvP server. It was a nice change. One of the people we befriended was a player named Phil. He seemed like a normal every day guy wanting to RP with the guild and was funny as hell. Myself, him, and a few others became fast friends and anything we all did was filled with goofiness. Just to let it be known I started dating a guy who was also involved in the same guild (not online dating we just happened to live in the same town and hit it off) and he was friends with Phil. 


 Things seemed normal. My gut didn't give me any creep vibes at all from this Phil person. From what I saw he had a girlfriend who played WoW also. They even role played a wedding on that game. Myself, Phil, and my boyfriend always did things in the game together and we were like the three amigos. I considered him a friend and I trusted him.


 Six months went by and one day my boyfriend and I got into an argument. I was miserable logged and onto WoW just to not deal with it. Phil seemed to sense something was up and kept asking me what was wrong until finally I told him that there was an argument. That was it, nothing else no gory details. It was like a light switch. My world was turned inside out that very moment. Suddenly Phil poured his heart out to me telling me how he had always loved me and that we were meant to be together. I was the reason he logged on WoW and I made his days better because I was in his life and that he needed me. Literally a tsunami of this came out, completely out of left field. I sat in stunned silence as he kept telling me over and over how he was in love with me and that we HAD to be together. I didn't know what to say. My friend, someone I trusted was pouring their heart out to me like this and it was absolutely not reciprocated. I gently turned him down and told him that although I was flattered, I didn't feel the same way and that I was in love with my boyfriend who was his friend and that he should respect it. Phil let out a mournful statement ""Now I have to put you in the friend zone. I can never be with you!""


 A little history on this guy Phil. He isn't very stable. He came to me in confidence and told me about how he was arrested and thrown into the psych ward multiple times for attacking his Mom then trying to commit suicide. He also bragged about using women who were depressed to get sexual favors out of them. He quickly recanted it though claiming he was joking when I got angry with him. Other than him sometimes coming to me and talking to me about his personal problems there was no indication of any attraction from his end. 


 It was different after that. I told my boyfriend what happened and he was not happy at all. He considered Phil a friend and what he did violated his trust and respect. He barely tolerated him if not at all. I don't blame him. Phil was a different person after that. He became obsessive and clingy. He kept bringing up that I was making a mistake and that NO ONE would love me as much as he did. He kept making ultimatums and threatened our friendship claiming he was quitting the game pretty much anything he could to try and change my mind. He didn't respect the fact I could make a fucking choice to be with someone I love. It's like he didn't understand I have the right to choose who I want to be with I didn't HAVE to be with him because he claimed he loved me.


 It got to the point he pretended to overdose/suicide on vent (a program people can use to talk to each other). I wish I was kidding. My boyfriend got pissed and logged off and I got very angry. I blew up at him how dare he pull this shit (my brother overdosed in front of me when he was suffering from drug abuse as a teen and Phil knew of this) I ripped him a new asshole telling him to quit his shit or I would ignore him and tell everyone what he was doing. I also told him I was going to call 911 right then and there to go and save him. Phil clammed up quickly and left vent. Not two hours later he was miraculously okay. 


 Things seemed to quiet after that. Phil stopped communicating with me and stayed away from our group of friends. It was peaceful. A month later he came back with a new girlfriend and I breathed a sigh of relief. Okay, I don't have to worry about this anymore. It all seemed like it was back to the old times but it only lasted one day. Just one. The next day I received a message from him about how he doesn't know how to choose between me or his new girlfriend and that he was still madly in love with me. What was there to choose?? I don't want you! I got really angry at him. I told him that he needed to respect his girlfriend and not pull this shit and to respect me and my decisions that I make for my own life. I would never EVER love him or ever be attracted to him.


 He became quiet again but a week went by and he started saying ""I love you"" to me in front of our friends and he started posting on my Facebook wall things about me breaking up with my boyfriend. Apparently random girls were sending him nudes to which he would text me and be like, ""what should I do? I want to be loyal to my girlfriend."" Hilariously I found one of those very pics on a porn site as an ad. I took a pic of it and sent it to him. The pictures finally stopped. The last time I logged out of vent at the last minute he said ""I love you"" and I logged back on and chewed him out in front of everyone. I told him to NEVER say that to me again and if anyone else hears him say this tell him to shut the fuck up. I was so angry and embarrassed. It was negatively effecting my relationship with my boyfriend and so I completely cut Phil out of my life. I unfriended him on Facebook. I blocked his number from being able to contact me as well.


 It didn't stop him though. He figured out my Skype info and started messaging me there. He also pestered my friends in game (who were wise to what he was doing) about me. Wanting to know info about me. It got to the point he asked someone for my personal address. In the end all of my friends blocked him from communicating with them and it seemed like it was over. Now and then he would try to communicate with me or one of my friends claiming he wanted to have a friendship again but he was promptly shut down. I wish I could convey in words the drama and misery he created with all the things he did. There was absolutely nothing to salvage. 


 We all moved onto bigger and better things, different games, different guilds. I became engaged to my boyfriend. Our relationship survived Phil and his craziness. It was all plain and simply wonderful until a few days ago. While I was offline Phil started making threats in the trade channel chat in regards to myself and my personal info being posted on a malicious website. The master of the guild, my fiance, and our friends joined immediately ran to my defense and pretty much had to threaten Phil's image to guilds he role plays with to get info from him. Phil at first tried to refuse claiming he would only talk to me but once his image was threatened he relented and he forked over the damage he did. He tried to claim I was being targeted ,completely random btw, that my personal info was released, pictures of me, and my WoW info. With some investigating it turns out Phil was the one who hacked into my personal emails and various other goodies and tried to ruin me some how by posting it on a dangerous website. It's frightening what he tried to do and all because I didn't want to be in an on line relationship with him. What's more crazy he told my guild master that he should make sure that I email him thanks for letting me know what happened. What a douche bag. 


 I consider myself lucky because it could have been far worse. He lives thousands of miles away from me. What damage was done was the end of a friendship I thought I had, the mental draining, the paranoia, and loss of security. I don't feel safe right now and I contacted the proper authorities in my area and I'm going to be filing harassment charges against him. Luckily I screenshot his nuttiness. Also I wrote a GM ticket begging for help regards to Phil's actions. He used to be my friend and I did care about him now I hate him. He wont stop, it doesn't matter how much time passes. Every few months he comes back and this is the climax. I just want peace. I realized long ago Phil didn't ""love"" me. He wanted to control me and him interjecting himself into my life now and then is him stilling trying to maintain control some how. Is it really so hard to just let go? If you have feelings for someone and they don't share them, the greatest way to show that you truly do care is that you respect them and let them be.


TL;DR - Guy becomes progressively more obsessed and destructive in our friendship ultimately causing him to be alienated. In revenge he posts my personal information on a malicious website and hacks my personal emails.

1352693951.0	131ot1	Nightmares for an active imagination	Gingerelicutter	120	16	23	"Ok, so I'm going to begin this by saying that I have an active imagination. Always have. Anything from the stereotypical, ""that tree branch on my window is a hand!"" to ""That mosquito bite is a tumor!"". I have THAT kind of imagination. 

This happened two years ago, when I was 14. I had two brothers, both on the varsity football team, and my dad, who was a boxer. So as you may imagine, little 5'2, 113 pound me felt very safe with them. I have a really bad habit of peeking around corners and doors before I walk, but that's besides the point. 

My brothers and dad were at a concert one night for some stupid reggae singer(not a fan) and I had just been dropped off at my house from the stable I keep my horse, so I smelt like a
Mixture of sweat, leather cleaner, and manure. I immediently ran upstairs, and jumped into the shower.

The layout of my upstairs is this: once on the top floor, the only room on the left is the master, where my dad sleeps. Right across is my room and at the end of the hallway is my brother Joe's room. Joe and I have little time rooms attached to ours, with nothing but a single sink and tiny counter with drawers. Then, attached to that, is a bathroom with a toilet and a shower, so all in all my brother and I share a shower, and if you go through the six doors(starting from mine), you would go in a giant arc that led back to the same hallway. It's pretty cool.

Anyway, I was showering, and while in the shower, I realized that I was infact home alone. I, like always when not in the protection of my men, began imagining all the awful things that could happen. My douchebag brain thought up every scary movie I have seen in the last 3 years. I vaguely remember poking my head out of the shower to glance and make sure both two doors were locked.

For that split second my eyes were closed to wash the soap off my face, I thought I heard a door open. I listened for a while, before deciding it was my imagination.

Then, I finished my shower and turned off the faucet. My heart will still skip a beat when I remember what happened next. I distinctly heard a drawer close. My drawer. Right outside of the bathroom, on my sink. Then I saw the door indent a bit on my brother's side, as if someone was leaning against it. I was frozen in silence. With the shower off, I could do nothing but listen. They never said anything. My phone was charging on my bed. I thought that if they couldn't hear my scared panting, they would hear my heartbeat.

It was probably 3 hours of sitting in the shower before I felt comfortable enough to slowest open the door to my room, make sure the coast was clear, and sprint to lock the door leading to my hallway. My room was a mess. All the drawers were taken out of my beauro, and my wallet, Jewelry, and stereo were missing. Even my makeup bag was dumped on the floor, in someone's search for valuables.

When I called the cops, it took probably 30 minutes for them to arrive. Whoever was in my house were long gone, but they took our two TVs, my fathers computer, and our microwave, along with an entire safe filled with nothing from my fathers closet. 

My dad didnt answer his phone Untill after the concert. We never got our stuff back. But trust me, I'm less inclined to stay home alone now."	t5_2t3t8	True
1347839305.0	zzu4c	Why I never go anywhere alone at night	Micha_Lee	121	17	28	"I lurk and lurk. Finally decided to post my story. For the record female 5'2 and about 100 pounds.

3 years back, shortly after I turned 18, I was working at a restaurant on a busy main road just outside Halifax Nova Scotia Canada. A very quiet place with very little crime especially at this time. 

So work had just ended, it was about 10pm and darkness had overtaken the warm night. I left the little diner and went to the bus stop to go about 10 minutes up the road to my then boyfriends house. The bus stop was in our now empty but fairly well lit parking lot and with all the kitchen staff still mere meters away inside the building I thought nothing of going out to wait for the bus myself.

I had been sitting for only a few minutes when a red 2 door pulled into the parking lot. I thought nothing of it. People pulled in after closing, saw the closed sign up, and left. Except this guy didn't. He didn't even go to the door.

""Hey""! He called from in his car which he stopped about 10 feet from the bus shelter separating me from the entrance to the restaurant. 

I gave a polite ""Hello"" in his direction and went back to watching for the bus.

""Where are you going beautiful""? He then questioned. 
I turned to look at him this time. He was still in his car, baseball hat pulled low, he appeared to be only a few years older then me. 

I responded that I was going to my boyfriends. The man then asked if I would rather hang out with him. When I declined he threw out this lovely comment ""I bet his dick doesn't look like mine"". 

I was incredibly nervous by this point but what could I do? His car separated my path inside. I reached into my pocket looking for my cell phone when it happened.

""Get in the car"". He cheerfully stated making a nodding motion beckoning me over.

I continued to, what I had hoped was discretely, search for my phone without ever taking my eyes off him giving him another polite ""No thank you"". 

Then, as if in slow motion he opened his door and rose out of the car turning to face me. Gone was that cheerful voice as he said it again much more aggressively. ""get in the car"".

Terrified doesn't even begin to describe how I was feeling as he took a single step beginning to round the hood toward me.

Then I heard a door open and out stepped Jim. A member of the kitchen staff with large tattooed armed and a long beard. He stared down at me from the steps and it took less then a second for the man to get back in his car, gun it from the parking lot, and screech off down the road. I tried to stare after him and get a plate but he moved too fast.

It still haunts me to this day what could have happened to me if Jim hadn't come outside at that moment. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1346110014.0	yxijg	The Salerno Strangler Stole My M&amp;M's	thoughtbubbles	119	14	11	"My first job was at the dollar tree. I was in 10th grade and it was the only place that would hire employees under 16 (I was 15). I had been working there for a few months when the owner began leaving me alone during my shifts. I typically worked Saturday and Sunday nights because the other employees were older and wanted to go out partying.

There was one man who became a regular customer later during the evenings. He would show up with a different woman every night. I suspected the women were hookers. He would always approach me at the register looking like he was cracked out his mind and ask for coffee. I explained to him that we did not have any coffee. Then I would have to reiterate the fact that yes, everything in the store was $1. He would end these visits almost every weekend night by grabbing a handful of M&amp;M’s and walking out of the store.

As a petite 15 year old girl, I would follow him to the door but not venture outside. I told him to please return the M&amp;M’s which he had not paid for, and a few times he looked at me genuinely confused and turned around to give the M&amp;M’s back to me. These visits happened a total of probably 5 or 6 times within the span of 3 weeks, and I wrote various reports about them to management.

A few months after the last time I saw the man, I was watching TV with my Dad when this man’s mugshot appeared on the screen. I had no doubt it was the same man I had encountered during those night shifts. He was being held without bail for the murder of 3 women he had paid to have sex with him. They were strangled in the woods across the street from the Dollar Tree where I worked, and he was deemed “The Salerno Strangler.”

My Dad made me quit my job, and my next job was working during the brunch/breakfast time at a coffee shop. After that I worked for pet stores and as a camp counselor, and have avoided working alone at night ever since."	t5_2t3t8	True
1342041554.0	wemil	I hear someone under the floor	mcmeowmix	119	15	12	"I've been lurking around, enjoying this subreddit, so I thought it was high time to share to share one of my stories. This is my first post ever on reddit, so be gentle please- advanced apologies if I do something incorrectly. This is my mother's story as much as mine, since I was so young at the time. 

This story took place in the mid 80's, when I was 4 or 5. My mother was in the process of divorcing my dad, and we (mom, older sister &amp; I) were staying with my aunt (her sister) and her family. My aunt and her then-husband had a nice piece of property, maybe 1/2 acre wide by 1 1/2 acres deep, dotted with oak trees and the remains of an ancient fruit orchard. The property inclined sharply from the road, crested about halfway through, then sloped downward at the back. On this property are two houses; the first is a very small, century-old farmhouse set into the hill, and the second is much newer (mid 70's) and much larger and sits at the crest of the small hill. My aunt and her family lived in the newer house and usually rented out the small house. During this time, though, their renters had just moved out and in the space between renters, my aunt and her husband were doing some work on the big house. Due to the nature of the work, they were using the little house for showers/cooking etc., and camped out a few nights to avoid paint fumes.  My mom, sister, and I were staying in the small house as well for a few weeks until our new house was ready. It was a little chaotic, but I liked being around my older cousins and loved climbing all the trees.

The little house has an interesting layout- the house is built into the hill, so the front facing the street is two stories, and the back is one story, but the living area is in the upper part of the house only. Under the middle part of the house is an odd-shaped root cellar/storage space/crawl space that is accessible only by double doors on the outside of the house and is barely tall enough to stand in. The ground floor (or first story) facing the street is an unfinished room usually used for storage since there is no insulation. Like the other storage room, there is no access to the upper part of the house, only a door that opens to the driveway that borders the house and leads to the big house. This room has two tiny windows set into the rock wall facing the street but no electrical wiring so at night it's pitch black. This room is directly under what at the time was the living room.

One day, a week or so after we had started staying there, my mom was washing dishes in the kitchen and I was playing in the living room. Everyone else was either at school or work, and my aunt's husband (who worked nights) was napping in the big house. It was probably around nine or ten, and I had just finished watching some cartoons. I turned off the tv, but was puzzled to still hear music. The sound was soft and words were indistinct, but I could still make out the melody of ""Twinkle, twinkle little star."" I knew we were the only ones home, and I couldn't figure out why the tv would still be making noise, so I looked around for the source. Once I realized where it was coming from, I went straight into the kitchen to tell my mom:

""I hear someone singing. It's coming from under the floor.""

She looked at me strangely, then followed me into the living room. She paused for a moment, listening, then without warning grabbed me and ran to the back door, pausing only for her keys, and ran to her car. The car was parked behind the small house, and as we drove down the driveway, we had to pass by the storage room doors. As we passed, the door to the larger storeroom opened and a man we had never seen before stepped out to watch us drive away.

My mom drove to her parent's house across town and called the big house to warn my aunt's husband- no answer. She then called my aunt at work, and explained what happened. My aunt left work and drove home, where her husband had been sound asleep the whole time. Later that evening, my aunt had a discussion with my mom, which I didn't hear about until years later. Apparently, my aunt's husband had a soft spot for those down on their luck, and had a habit of letting them stay at the little house between renters. Apparently he had told some guy he could spend a few nights in the storeroom, but hadn't told anyone, including his own wife or the single women with children (us) who were sharing the house at night alone with this ""roommate."" My aunt admitted later that because of the type of people that showed up randomly, she often slept with a knife under her pillow.

(This was especially disturbing as not only were most of the ""hard luck"" guys druggies/drunks, but the town in which this happened is known nationwide for our one claim to fame: the state hospital for the criminally insane, which has a special ward for sexually violent predators. Escapes are non-existent, but many are released directly into our community.)

My mom, sister, and I ended up staying with my grandparents for another week before we moved into our new, normal house. We only went back to the other place to get our things, and the little house was rented out shortly after. My aunt divorced my uncle a year or two later, and we lost touch with him after that.

That's not the end of the story, though...

I NOW LIVE IN THAT SAME HOUSE.

My aunt's ex had kept the property in the divorce, and continued to rent out the little house. A few years ago, my husband and I were living a few towns away from my hometown, and we heard through the grapevine that the house might be up for rent again soon, and we reconnected with my aunt's ex. He had long ago stopped letting drifters use the house, and while the house has a few drawbacks due to its age and shoddy construction, the property is beautiful and more than makes up for the uneven floors and lack of AC. The odd layout of the house means that any of the bedrooms could be used as a living room, so when we moved in, we chose to use the back room as our living room, and the old living room at the front of the house is now the guest bedroom. The storerooms are now both wired with electricity so we can go in them at night, and I feel totally comfortable in the house- I've slept there alone and been fine. We use the front storeroom for just that purpose- storing stuff. This room will always be creepy, due to the rough stone walls and hordes of spiders that enter through the cracks in the mortar, and when we were moving in it stank overwhelmingly of death...due to the possum that had died in the walls. We don't spend much time in there, just a quick dash in to grab/put something away, and we keep it locked.

Every once in a while, in the dead of night, I will hear deer moving from the field next door towards our house and I swear it sounds like footsteps on the driveway, headed for that door...which is just below the windows in the room where we sleep.

1341861440.0	wa9md	Trust your instincts.	beep_beep_boop	117	14	13	"So this happened a few nights ago.

I came home from work at about 10:30 pm. I had worked a double so I was pretty tired and out of it by the time I arrived home, and I went inside forgetting my cellphone in my car. By the time I realize this it's a little after 11. Now, I don't live in the best part of town (not ghetto, but sleazy is a good way of putting it), but I have lived here for about a year now and nothing ever happened so I figured I would be fine to grab my cell from my car. I'm about to leave my apartment when I get a strange feeling in the pit of my stomach. Enough things have happened for me to know to trust my instincts, so I grab a tazer that my boyfriend gave me not long ago.

I walk through my building and outside to the parking lot. My car is about 50 ft. left of the door, if that. I walk towards it and I hear the shuffling of feet to my right. I see a man walking across the lot, he is hiccuping and stumbling around, obviously drunk. I don't really think anything of it as I see drunk people shortcutting though the lot all the time. 

I reach my car and quickly grab what I need, making sure to keep  an eye on this guy. I lock my car and turn to head back when I notice he starts swinging his keys. He swings them around violently and looks in my direction. At this point I'm really freaked out so I turn the tazer on but keep it hidden in my jacket. The man continues to stumble towards me, hiccuping but not saying a word, wildly swinging his keys in the air, and his pace quickens. 

Suddenly he's standing not 10 feet from me, I could tell by his eyes that he had had far too much to drink. At this point he had basically cornered me in between my car and another. I decide to speak up finally and manage to ask him ""Whats up man?"" I don't break eye contact, not that you could really call it that, and he doesn't say anything but takes a few more steps towards me still swinging those keys.

At this point I NOPE, and pull the tazer out and shoot it off in his direction, and firmly tell him to, ""Back up."" He reels back a bit, stops swinging his keys, and looks me up and down. Now I'm not the most intimidating person, (20 y/o female, 5'6"") but it seems that the tazer was enough, he backed off, and started stumbling off perhaps continuing to his original destination. I keep my tazer out and run back into my apartment, making sure to lock the front, patio, and bedroom doors. 

I don't even want to think about what might have happened if I hadn't listened to my gut feeling.

1340059558.0	v8wkz	Minnesota Nice Can Get You in Trouble...	TheRipsawHiatus	114	12	27	"This happened about four years ago when I was seventeen. Me, about ten girlfriends, my mother, aunt, and cousin, all took a trip down to Minneapolis one December. We planned a day of Christmas shopping, dinner out, and to end the day watching the Holidazzle Christmas Parade. 

Well, the day went pretty decent. I'm not really someone who enjoys shopping, in fact I hate it. So when evening came, and it was time for dinner, I was grateful to sit down and be done with walking through the crowds at Macy's. 
We were all sat at this long table that was lengthwise parallel to an equally long window that faced the street the parade was going to be coming down. It was a perfect view! We could eat dinner and stay warm from the Minnesota cold while we watched the event. It really could not have been better. 

At dinner, we were all having a great time. I think we were all feeling some Holiday cheer. I was feeling in particularly good spirits for what ever reason, and every time a passerby on the sidewalk would walk passed our window, I would smile and maybe throw out a friendly wave to them. I've always been a firm believer that the small gesture of a friendly smile can brighten someone's day, even a little bit.

One man walked by slowly and looked in the window. He looked poor, his teeth were rotten and missing even though he only looked to be in his late twenties, and his clothes were baggy and a mess. I gave him a warm smile when we made eye contact, and went back to eating my food. 

A few minute later, I see him walk by again, looking right at me the whole time. I didn't think much of it, and went on eating my dinner. 

However, after about the seventh time he passed the window, each time with his eyes locked on me, I started to worry. As did everyone else.
Even more so when he finally stopped walking by the window, and just stood across the street for about 10 minutes, looking at me the entire time he stood there.
I tried to not make eye contact with him anymore, hoping that if I ignored him he would stop, but every time I would look up to see if he was still standing there, sure enough he hadn't moved. 
Then he just disappeared from across the street. We all thought, ""Oh, thank god he's gone.."" and relaxed a little. Then my aunt who was sitting across from me said, ""Don't turn around. He's in the restaurant.""


At this point, I WTFing pretty hard. I didn't dare turn around to look at him, I just ignored his presence, trying to make conversation with my best friend, but he was hard to ignore when in my peripherals I see him sit down at the table right next to us. 

He turned his chair slightly, and just stared at me for five fucking minutes. Doing nothing but staring at me. I did the only thing I could at that moment, and just ignored him and encouraged everyone else to do the same. My best friend was freaking out, she's a huge paranoid basket-case, and the biggest worry-wart I know, I kept telling her to just shut the fuck up and get some dessert. I was worried that he would hear us talking about him.

After staring at me for five minutes, he got a cup of coffee and pulled out a beaten up old notebook. He quickly got to scribbling away, hunched over the pages, furiously writing things down, and occasionally taking a break to look over at me. This went on for about an hour. 

It came to the point when I had to pee, but going to the bathroom meant walking right passed him. Figuring there's safety in numbers, a couple of my friends agreed to go with me. As soon as he saw me stand up, so did he. But he quickly sat back down when he saw my friends stand up too. He watched me as I walked to the bathroom. 

We came back to the table, and of course, he's still there writing away on his notebook. After so much time had gone by, it was almost, *almost*, easy to forget he was even there. After all, I was in a public place, surrounded by people, friends, and family. If this creep was going to try anything, it wouldn't be easy for him. 

The parade started, and I relaxed a lot as I watched it go by. That was until he approached me. There he was, standing to my right, less than a foot away, with a letter in his hand. He spoke to me, and well, I couldn't understand him. He was clearly mentally handicapped. I really wish I could make out what he said, but I can tell you his voice was kind, and non-threatening. I simply smiled and nodded and said, ""Oh, OK."" I took the letter he handed me, and he walked away. 

I waited for him to leave before I looked at the letter, and felt a rush of relief as he walked out the door. There were about four pages all folded up. I unfolded them with everyone at the table leaning over me trying to see what this guy wanted me to know so badly.
 
Now I had saved these notes for a couple years, but eventually threw them out while cleaning my room. I really wish I hadn't now that I'm writing this to you, but I'll have to just give you a recap of what letter said as I remember it. 

For starters, his handwriting was awful, almost unreadable. I've seen five year-olds with better penmanship. His spelling was no better, and the entire letter was incoherent. So, if what I'm about to write is hard to follow, well that's the point.

The letter started out strange right from the get-go. He said he saw me on a bus a long time ago, I was with my little girl, and I smiled at him. (let me just say, I don't ride the bus, and I don't have a little girl). He said he thought I was beautiful and my little girl looked like an angel. In fact, he was convinced we were both angels, him as well. He said he would often think of me, and hope that I was doing OK, and that my little girl was safe. He was so excited to see me today at the restaurant, when I smiled at him through the window, he knew it was me. He would recognize that smile anywhere. 

Then things got creepier:

He told me how he has a little girl too, and he needs my help to get her taken away from her mother who has custody of her. He wanted my help to kidnap her. He wanted me to buy him a car, so we could take him and his daughter out of the U.S. to somewhere safe, where the government wont find us, like Canada, Holland, or Israel. So we can be a family, and I can have lots of golden-haired children with him and make God proud of us. 

Yeah, it was disturbing. But truth be told, he was obviously a very sick man, and I couldn't help but feel bad for him. I'm guessing by how jumbled and incoherent the letter was, he was probably schizophrenic. 
I think everyone at the table felt a bit sad for this guy, after all, I don't really think he meant any harm, he was just *very* confused.  

The parade had ended, and we were getting up to go. We walked out of the restaurant, and there he was, waiting on the corner across the street. He saw me walk out and immediately started running towards me. Luckily there was a huge crowd of people on the streets heading home from the parade, and we easily let ourselves slip away in to the crowd, and entered a nearby building to take the skywalk out of there. 
And that was the last I saw of him. 


We grow up being told to not talk to strangers, but in Minnesota where it's common practice to smile at people on the street, one would never think of the danger that just *smiling* at a stranger could do too."	t5_2t3t8	True
1334776095.0	sggou	My encounter with a serial killer	Melawian	120	18	27	"I was living in Asheville, North Carolina at the time.  I hung out at a local coffee shop all of the time.  The day I met this guy was like any other.  I went in to the coffee, ordered my coffee, and sat down to read the local IWANNA when an older man came up to me and asked if he could sit down.

I had gone in there to meet new people, and usually I went for younger guys, but I thought what the heck.  I said yes, and he sat down and started to ask me questions.  Where did I work? Where did I live? Did I have any relatives? etc.  Of course, during the discourse, I asked him questions and found out that he was a traveling salesman who travelled I 40 from Ohio to Asheville. The last question he asked me was how old I was.   When I told him, he couldn't believe me.  I looked a lot younger than I was.  At the time, I was 29, but looked like a teenager.   Part of my kitch was to show people my ID, and I showed it to him, too.  As soon as he saw it, he said, ""Thanks for the chat,"" and got up and left. 

I didnt think anything of it until I went to get another cup of coffee.  The guy behind the coffee bar asked me if the old man was bothering me.  I told him that it wasn't anything I couldn't handle and thanked him for his concern.

The next night I went to a strip club with my on again off again boyfriend that had just opened up a town over.  My boyfriend asked me if I wanted to strip because someone had offered the manager $500 for me to strip.   I didn't want to, but was pretty interested to find out who it was that was going to pay me that much to strip.  Coincindence or no, it was the same guy from the coffee shop.  I was creeped out.

He came up to me later on that night and started talking to me about how many people he had killed in Vietnam--especially young woman and children.  I was really creeped out then and edged away from him and found another group of friends to hang with and made sure I as never alone.  He didn't try anything, though. He just left.

I kind of freaked out, but didn't really do anything about.  I just went to work the next day, and one of the girl's I worked with came up and asked if I had heard about that girl who had been stabbed in the neck from behind as she came out of one of the bars.  The girl went on saying that her dad was a cop, and they were looking for a serial killer who was killing young girls from Ohio to Asheville off of I40.  They werent sure but they thought he was an older guy who probably was a traveling salesman.  The cops thought that he had a thing for woman who had my characteristics and were 18 and under. 

I freaked out and told her about that guy.  She called her dad, but I dont know if they didnt believe me or what, but they didn't question me.  I really think that the only thing that saved me was the fact that I was much older."	t5_2t3t8	True
1376200861.0	1k4rgm	Psych Ward Phone Calls	makennawenna	126	22	11	"For some background information; about two years ago, I had to go to a psychiatric facility so I could deal with my depression issues. At this time I was a 14 year old girl. I was at the hospital for three days when all of this started.

The third day I was there, I woke up with an awful stomach ache. I convinced the nurses to let me stay in from the activities and sleep off the pain. So i'm alone in the hospital (plus the staff) when the patient phone starts ringing. I run over to answer thinking it would be my boyfriend calling, but instead its a mans voice I don't recognize. 
    ""Can I talk to Sandra?"" 
I was the only patient there, so I said she wasn't there.
     ""Oh, alright. Thanks. Who is this?""
The voice sounded a lot like my friends dad who I had just met the night before during visiting hours. I told him my name, figuring he would recognize it.
      ""What are you in here for, makennawenna?""
I told him it was personal. This started to raise red flags for me, because I had told my friend's Dad why I was there the night before.
       ""Did you fight to get in here? Like beat up other girls""
I said no, and I was quickly becoming creeped out. It took a few more personal questions for me to realize there was no Sandra at the hospital. I wasn't sure on everyones names but I definitely hadn't heard Sandra before. I really started becoming uncomfortable and I told him I had to go, and that was that. 

Visiting hours come around and theres a phone call for me. A man asking for makennawenna, saying it was my Dad. But my Dad was sitting right next to me. I explained that he had called earlier, and my Dad was pissed. He went over to the phone and demanded to know who was calling, the man didn't say anything and hung up.

After a couple more calls asking for me by name, I told the hospital staff. They became very concerned and we weren't allowed to answer the phones for a while. Apparently a convicted rapist has been calling the mental hospital for years, getting names of the girls who answer the phone. He then uses whatever information he learns from the girls and calls back continually posing as their Dad or boyfriend. Apparently he even tried to pick up patients a couple times. The weirdest part is, when you call the hospital you have to know the birthday of the patient you are trying to reach, or the staff won't put the call through. So he somehow knew a bunch of crazy teenage girls' info, and used it to prey on us when we least expected it.

It definitely freaked me the fuck out, seeing as he should've been the one in the hospital."	t5_2t3t8	True
1375775895.0	1jssmp	The Faceless Driver	mikefthrowaway	126	24	8	"I was in about the 4th or 5th grade and finally old enough to walk home by myself from school like a big kid. It wasn't a very long path, but I felt a sense of pride in it, as if every single one of those footsteps were tiny bridges bringing me closer and closer to my ultimate independence. Looking back now, it’s eerie to think how close my first steps of freedom were to making me run for my life. 

It was the mid 90’s and we had just moved to Miami, Florida. Shortly after we got there, news broke out over an abduction, rape and murder of a boy only a grade older than me. His name was Jimmy Ryce. It was the first time I learned that there were bad people around who did bad things.

I’ll never forget how much my parents and teachers stressed me not to talk to strangers, how to dial 911, and other hints, tips and tricks to help keep me safe after that. I think it’s safe to say I was a bit more cautious and aware of my surroundings than I would have been otherwise had it not been for Jimmy. 

Well on this particular day when I was walking down the avenue home from school, I noticed something strange that caught my attention. The same old junky car sitting at the stop sign in front of me was sitting at the last two stop signs behind me. As soon as I would cross the street in front of the car, the driver would zip around and the block and be at the next stop sign, once again waiting for me to cross the road.

But after about 3 more blocks of this, I turned down the last street to my house and he drove away. I remember thinking it was weird, but I figured that he have been lost or something. Just a strange coincidence. I didn’t think too much about it after that. 

Fast forward a few weeks later and it’s Friday. I’m super excited for the weekend and my best friend Luis is walking home with me so we can play video games and watch movies after school.

Well as we’re walking home together, I noticed that same old junky car pull up to the stop sign. Words cannot begin to describe the speed at which my brain re-calculated the previous event, which I had almost forgotten, and refiled the thoughts I harbored of him ""probably being lost"", and replaced them with the ""oh my god"" as I realized I was possibly being targeted by this person. 

As soon as I noticed him I tried to play it cool. I didn’t want him to read my face. I told Luis not to look, but gave him the run down that the same car ahead of us at the stop sign had followed me one time when I was walking home, and that we needed to make a plan. 

As we crossed the street I tried to nonchalantly draw my eyes over to the drivers seat to see the face of the man inside the car, but his tints were so strong that I couldn’t see anything but the silhouette of a man facing directly at me. 

I’ve read a few times before that when someone points a gun at you and you’re in their cross-hairs, your body can somehow sense it, even miles away. I suppose it’s the same way you can feel it when someone is looking at you in a room. Now I don’t think this person had a gun pointed at me, but my body could feel his eyes watching me while I crossed the road in a way that gave me feel terribly uneasy. The only way to describe it was feeling like a big hungry alligator was really mad at me and I didn’t know why.

My skin was crawling as he turned around the street and pulled up again in front of the next stop sign. I could tell by the way he drove that his attitude was different this time. The first time it seemed he was trying to be inconspicuous and just blend in, this time I think he knew that I knew what was happening, and he drove with more bravado, and would inch the car closer to us at the stop sign to intimidate us whereas before he would stay fairly well behind the white line. 

It felt like he was getting himself pumped up for something. 

We were totally freaked out, but we were still trying our hardest to play it cool and act like we didn’t notice.

While he drove around the block to meet us at the stop sign at the street my house was on, we planned to write his license plate numbers down. As the car pulled up to the stop sign, we made a right instead of crossing him, and Luis pulled the pencil and paper out of his backpack and I read him the plate numbers real quick.

He definitely noticed what was going on, because he peeled away from the stop sign to go back around the block again.

At this point he wasn’t even trying to hide it anymore. It was time to run.

As soon as he turned the corner we bolted all the way to my house as fast as we could move. I don’t know if I said anything to Luis, or if we were communicating telepathically to each other, but somehow we both knew we had to get inside my house before he could see which house we were going to.

 Anyway, i’ll never forget this, but as soon as we were crossing the final street two houses from my house I looked down the road to see if he was there and I saw him turn a sharp corner super fast about 300 ft away and just saw him flooring the car so he could intercept us. 

Before that moment I had only seen him pulling up to the stop sign, but this time I was seeing just how aggressively he was actually pursuing us and it was scary as fuck.

Luckily enough we were fast and able to unlock the door and get inside just before he pulled down our street. I stared out the peek-hole and watched his car slowly drive around a few times before he finally disappeared.

I called my mom and told her to come home because we just got chased my some weird man and she rushed home and we told her everything. Thankfully, my mother works in corrections, and as soon as we told her the story and that we had his license plate numbers she was able to send a few police officers she worked with over to visit the guy.  

I don’t know if I’ll ever really know what happened, but she told me that the cops found the location of the owner of the vehicle and decided to go have a chat with him “off the record”. I didn’t know it at the time, but I found out years later that she went with them. She said he was some thirty something year old guy living with his parents, and that he denied everything, and his parents were surprised, but that the cops thought he was a fucking weirdo and didn’t believe anything he said. 

They told him they were going to be watching him cause they know what he was doing and that if I ever saw him again they were gonna personally come back for him and they scared the shit out of him. 

I never saw him again."	t5_2t3t8	True
1363287964.0	1aaubt	The Honeymooners	clash_by_night	130	26	11	"I worked at Holiday Inn one summer before starting grad school. I was a part of food and beverage service, which meant I spent most of my time in the restaurant, but some really bizarre stuff happened when I went to other parts of the hotel, especially when doing room service.  

One night, a young couple checked in and we never saw them after that. They never came out of the room and ordered room service for every meal. We only ever spoke to the man when he called to order room service and only saw him when we delivered it. He always answered the door alone and only far enough to hand us payment. The only thing that let us know another person was there was that he ordered two meals each time, usually burgers. They also never took the “Do Not Disturb” sign off the door, so housekeeping never went in, either. After a couple of days, the staff started talking about this sort of strange behavior. I assumed that they were perhaps on their honeymoon. It was the only thing that even remotely explained why they never left the room and didn’t want to be disturbed. 

After about three days, though, we realized that the trays we had brought the meals on were still in the room, and we were running out of trays. Even if they didn’t understand that they were supposed to return the trays, there’s a little card on each one that explains that when they are done with the meal, guests can set the tray outside their room and someone will come and get it. 

Finally, we had to do something because we were running out of trays. It had been a few days, and they ordered room service for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, so they had to have had more than a half-dozen trays in their room. With our manager’s permission, we called and asked if we could remove some of the trays from their room. The guy, who had been extremely polite the entire time, said sure. Another girl and I got a cart and headed off to the room. 

The man met us at the door dressed only in shorts, which he was zipping up as he opened the door. Frankly, this in itself isn’t that unusual. I was still under the impression they were on their honeymoon, so lots of alone naked time with the new spouse is expected. He was at least wearing clothing. We quickly went in and noticed several odd, disturbing things. 

First, the trays we were after were stacked all over the room, covering every available surface, including the TV, and even the floor. Each one had half-eaten food. This is two or three days worth of old food just sitting in the room. That’s pretty gross, to start with. 

Second, the woman was lying in the bed with the blankets pulled up to her neck. When she shifted a bit, we could see that she was wearing a t-shirt and underwear only. Again, not that unusual, but she seemed to be really out of it. I thought she had to have been under the influence of something, or perhaps sick or injured. She didn’t speak to us, but she was mumbling a bit and her eyes weren’t focusing on anything.  It was completely bizarre. 

Third, the room was sweltering. The heat was on, and this was about mid-July in the South, so nearly 100 degrees outside. We were in a sweat just being in the room for a minute or two. Again, the woman had the blankets completely covering her body, except for when she moved slightly and they slipped off. 

We got our stuff loaded up and the guy, though very nice and polite, clearly couldn’t wait to get rid of us. We waited until we were out of sight before turning to each other and confirming that yes, what we had just seen was incredibly weird. 

I went from thinking this was a young couple on a very sex-filled honeymoon to wondering if this woman was sick or going through detox or something. It was just overall weird. Hot room, nearly naked people, rotting food lying around, the woman’s behavior, their reluctance to let anyone in, even to clean, and their reluctance to leave… it was strange. 

I was concerned about her, so I asked my manager about it. The couple was later asked to leave because of non-payment, but that’s all I know. 

Oh, I didn’t mention the smell. That was another thing. It smelled like sickness or rot. You know the way your skin smells when you take off a band-aid? Well, the whole room smelled like that. Some of it might have been the food, or maybe their sweat from the damn heat, but it was awful. 

To this day, I wonder what I witnessed. 

TL;DR: Couple acts very strangely in hotel, no clue what I saw, and oh, god, the smell.

1355721144.0	14z9i5	The creeper in the red van...	RUA_bug_Bill_Murray	144	40	12	"Me: 10-11 year old, male.
Location: New England


So I remember one day after school, me and 3 of my friends were playing 2-on-2 football out in my front yard.  It was winter time, but not that cold out, and I remember it was still light out but getting dark, so it was probably around 4pm-4:30pm.  


We didn’t live on a busy street, so not a lot of cars would drive by, and when they did we usually recognized them as somebody who lived in our area.  That made it a little weird when we saw the same red van drive by slowly 4 times in a row within like a 10 minute span.  You know how most cars might go 15mph-20mph on those side residential streets, well this guy wasn’t even doing 5mph.  The first couple of times he drove by we didn’t really notice and didn’t think much about it, as this was the time of day when a lot of people started coming home from school and work, and besides we were involved in our little football game.  But every time the van drove by, and like I said he kept driving by real slow, we saw the guy in the van looking out at us, as if he was checking us out.  After that 3rd and 4th time we started to get a little freaked out about it.  What is that guy doing?  Why is he checking us out? Why does he keep driving by real slow, looking out at us?  Having driven by 4 times now, we definitely got a good look at him.  He was a younger guy in his 20’s, unshaven, unkept, dressed all messy.  Me and one of my friends were definitely freaked out and thought we should go back inside, but my other couple of friends wanted to finish the game and argued that it would be dark soon so if we went in now we’d never get to finish the game.  Also they reminded me that my dad was home, so what’s the worst that can happen?  Besides that van’s probably not coming back again anyway.  We were stupid kids, and the 2 that wanted to stay out were definitely hard headed, and they ended up convincing us to stay outside and finish our game.


Wrong decision.  We had barely completed one more play, when that same red van started creeping down our street again, and this time it seems, he’s driving even slower! But instead of slowly driving by us like every other time, this time the van stops right in front of us.  My heart stops and I freeze in my tracks, my other friend, the one who wanted to go in, took a few steps back towards the house ready to run if anything happened.  That's when the guy in the van rolls down the window and started talking to us.  We couldn’t hear what he said, and while I was still frozen in my tracks, the hard headed friends who were insistent about staying outside to finish the game actually went up to the van to see what the guy wanted!


That’s when my dad came outside.  “What do you want!?” He angrily said to the guy, in a way to let the guy know he was right there and don’t even think about messing with my kids.  He said something back to my dad, my dad said something back to him and ended up just driving off, but not before driving by one more time.  This time he didn’t stop though.  So apparently my dad saved us from a creeper, or so we thought.


*NOW THIS IS WHERE THE STORY GETS WEIRD!*  I was actually the guy driving the van.  Lol.  One Christmas break from college, I got a job delivering flowers/holiday arrangements to make a few extra bucks.  I had this one delivery to Mrs. Clark on 125 Side Street.  Drove down the street and back again slowly looking for the house, didn’t see it, so I drove down and back yet again trying to find it.  Still nothing.  These kids were on the side of the street where the house should have been.  They were at like house number 119 or something (while I’m looking for 125), but the road curved shortly after their house and then there was a little wooded area, and then the next thing you know you’re looking at houses with addresses in the 130’s.  Hmmm.  Having no luck finding the house on my own, I pulled up to the kids and asked if they knew where the Clarks lived (hoping one of them would say, “that’s me” or “they live right there”).  The kids didn’t hear me at first (them being on the passenger side of the van), so one of them came up to hear what I was saying.  That’s when the dad came out, and angrily asked what I wanted.  I was just innocently delivering flowers, and couldn’t find the house (apparently though people often ordered flowers for family/friends but got their address slightly wrong a lot, making some houses basically impossible to find).  Looking back though, I can definitely see how bad it looked.  Nondescript red van, has driven by several times slowly, then tries to talk to kids playing in the front yard.  That’s the thing about a lot of these stories though, a lot of times people are creeped out about something that may have actually just been nothing.  Haha, maybe those kids/dad really thought I was up to no good and will even post that story here some day.

1352935694.0	137iko	Switched classes because of weird guy	morbidmind1	119	16	21	"I am a 22 yr old guy in college. I just started this one class and by the second week I notice this one loner. I had the misfortune of being nice to this guy in class. He sat way in the back and in a corner when only half the class was taken up.I didn't think this was weird as I also sit in the back but closer to the front. Anyway, one day I interact with him and try to chat. I notice he had anime as his laptop background. Being sort of into anime/animation I bring it up but he begins to get creepy. He quickly brings up his fetish for anime porn or hentai. I think...""okay, hes a guy. He obviously watches porn and this happens to be his thing. Whatever"" I treat this as a guy thing,I brushed off. Then he pulls up this folder and shows me some hentai porn...in the hallway of our college. After a few pics of tentacle porn, I had enough and leave until the class room is open. Sadly, the guy SITS next to me in the back of the class rather than his corner seat. Throughout class he shows me random Japanese comics which I don't get while he laughs loudly, disrupting class. I just nod and smirk while I try to pay attention. It's the weekend and I don't need to see him till next week. On Friday, I get an e-mail from this guy. I never gave him my e-mail. Apparently, the teacher did not hide the e-mails when he sent the course info and he was able to find my e-mail because it has my name. He sends me a message wanting to hang out on Sat. and some random anime pics. I ignore all e-mails. Next class, I sit in a different spot near some attractive women I've sort of got to know (hoping he'd be to intimidated to sit near them) he comes right to me and beings telling me his weekend. I spoke maybe 3 sentences to this guy and he immediately wants to form a connection. He asks how come I didn't respond to e-mail and I said I forgot. He then demands my number in a joking way but I can tell he really wants it. I say I am not comfortable with this. He then got quiet and went to his old seat. I am kinda worried but who cares. What happened creeped me out.  To preface this, I live near campus. He live far away, no where near me (keep that in mind) Next class, I am a little late. He is already inside. He walks to me and says ""what took you so long?"" I asked ""what?"" and he told me he saw me leave me apartment and saw me take my usual route to class but did not arrive in the amount of time it usually takes from my apt door to class at my average walking speed. He actually said that entire thing to me! I nervously laughed it off. I immediately go to the teacher and request I transfer to another time he teaches this subject, citing work conflict. I also take a different walking route to school. Scary enough, a few weeks after I run into those girls I tried sitting next to and talk with them. I ask if that creepy guy is still in it and they said after 2 weeks of me not showing up he simply vanished. His name was on the roster but he stopped showing. I did see him one day near this Asian market, just watching people. Luckily he didn't see him.

Edit: I forgot to mention he told me about his love (he said love) of writing incest/rape fan fiction. And offered to write me into one of his stories.

tl;dkr - crazy hentai guy started stalking/obsessing over me. Still creepy last time I checked. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1352445120.0	12wjix	Creepy guy casing my house	Olivesophia	125	22	8	"So this isn't that creepy, but it still kinda freaks me out. 

Just some background information, my dad doesn't work, he has chronic back pain and can't sleep too well. He lets my mom sleep all night and then sleeps all morning after she leaves for work. My senior year I only had to take 3 classes and was home by 1030 most days and my dad would still be asleep for quite some time after I got home. It was one of these days we received a creepy visitor at the door.

He rang the doorbell and got my dogs riled up, I put them in the back yard and opened the door. He said he was with ""such and such"" security and wanted to speak to an adult. I told him that my dad wasn't available and he countered with ""Well where's your mom?"" And I said she was at work and he told me ""Well I can come back, when is your dad available?""
Just to note that not one single bell is going off in my head, I answer and say ""idk mostly in the afternoons,"" (it's only 11 o' clock right now) and he goes ""and when does your mom get home from work?"" And of course stupid me tells him ""about 9 pm most days"" and he tells me ""ok, I'll be back to speak to them when they're available."" I tell him ok and shut the door.

All of a sudden my dad who must have heard the door bell comes in and asks who it was, I tell him it was ""Joe from ""such and such"" security wanting to talk to you"" my dad asks what I said to him and I give him a detailed description of our conversation. My dad instantly bolts out the door and stands in the driveway looking up and down our street then asks me ""if Joe is going door to door, where is he?"" At this point our  cross the street neighbor comes over and ask who was I talking to at my door. I tell her and she responds saying she thought he was from the home owners association because he walked up and down our street twice, stared at a couple houses but only rang our doorbell. So my dad calls ""such and such"" security and asks if there is a Joe working the neighborhood. Not only do they not have a Joe working for them but they don't have any circulators out this week. 

My dad called the police and lo and behold, no one fitting the description was found in the neighborhood. My dad told me that he was trying to find our schedules so he could rob us. Fortunately, my dad is Always home and always being vigilant of strange sounds or anything of the like so we were never robbed but I still feel kinda creeped out everytime someone comes to my door.

1344671042.0	y1h6c	Surreal, creepy apartment	unipine	127	23	25	"So, first post. Here goes.

In Michigan there is a place called Traverse City. It's a smallish, very esoteric hippie kind of town. In this town there is a bona fide abandoned mental institution, complete with an absolutely enormous deserted grounds and delapidated buildings, an old rusty water tower, a huge stone basin in the middle of the woods that could hold maybe fifty people- you know, the works. This isn't the creepy part, believe it or not, as nothing scary really happened there. It was actually quite the popular hangout for college kids to get stoned and whatnot. It's more of a small detail on how strange this town is, and kind of a backstory. See, when the mental ward shut down, the patients were basically let loose to their own devices and many of them ended up as one of the many homeless people that roamed the town. And some of them just ended up in The Whiting.

The Whiting was the cheapest apartment in town, basically a month to month hotel. It really wasn't a bad place-there was a housekeeper that stopped by once a week to clean the place up, it wasn't falling apart or infested with pests or anything.It was technically a sort of halfway home years and years ago, and had to be shut down when some man was found dead of heroin overdose on the front steps. It reopened to the public again, and some of the people who had lived there previously had nowhere else to go and moved back in. At this point of the story, I was a brokeass college kid. I got some weird vibes from the place but was short on money and thought it would be an interesting experience anyways. I wasn't wrong.

First of all, it looked like the architect had gleaned inspiration from The Shining. Long narrow hallways, some straight, some swooping around, some that started out normal and then got so narrow that you literally had to walk sideways to fit. There was painted over doors, doors that led to nowhere, tiny doll-sized doors in the hallway that never opened. Creepy pictures of crying girls or off-putting abstract paintings decorated the walls. My friend lived in a small room that had a large mysterious 'X' painted over his bed. He also had a painted-over, locked door to his left. And my other friend who lived on the second story, at the end of the building, had a window that looked out at a straightup brick wall. 

Bizarre, but ok, right? Wait until you meet your neighbors. Schizophrenics and drugged-out zombies wandered up and down the halls or peeked out of their doors before slamming it shut. You could be walking along when the door would suddenly open and a battered-looking woman would tell you that the other tenants were trying to murder her, and that she was sleeping with a knife for protection. Another friend of mine once opened her door and found an entire lamp, taken apart piece by piece and aligned on her doorstep. 
A few incidents stick out in my mind. Once I went down to the shared kitchen to make myself lasagna (often you could find free food when the schizophrenics left them for fear of government interference. They would leave garbled notes with the food and everything). One of the women was already there, sitting in a kitchen chair talking to herself in a high-pitched girlish voice. Now, this woman was a big and rather imposing individual, made all the more intimidating because she had a habit of ramming people in the shoulder when she passed them in the halls. She's sitting there and she's mocking me and insulting me the whole time, but all to herself as if I can't hear her, all while eyeing me with a sideways, dead-eyed kind of look. Every now and then, she gives a high-pitched giggle that sounded truly sinister. Well, I say ""everything alright?"" and she's muttering to herself ""the thing's talking to me, I won't respond, giggle giggle"" and I am definately perplexed at this point. I pick up a fork and I'm getting ready to exit and she really flips and starts talking rapidly, ""You got that fork? You gonna kill me with that? YOU GONNA STAB ME INTHE THROAT AND MURDER MY FAMILY WITH THAT FORK??"" Yes, she was screaming by the end of it. I didn't stick around, I could still hear her screaming when I take my shit out the door, going on about murdering her. And just like some movie, I can hear high-pitched, hysterical laughter echoing down the halls as she gets louder and louder. Truly brought goosebumps up my arms, I can tell you that.
Another time a man, so fucked up on some substances that he could hardly stand, tried to chase me. He was at the foot of the stairs and I had to pass him, and he tried to slur some nonsense at me while I walked by him- think he said something about a ""shower"". Well, he reaches out and grabs my arm and pulls me toward him. I pull away so fast he gets knocked over, and as I'm running up the stairs he's trying to collect himself and stand up. I hide in my friend's room and we can hear him slouching and banging up the stairs, calling for me in a doped up sort of way. A week later, he apparently forgets about it and I see him in the lobby. He asked me which room I lived in.

So yeah, that's a brief summary of the creepy place I lived in for a short while, although its missing some additional details and stories that add to its general surreality. Don't know if it belongs here but thanks for letting me ramble. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1342379804.0	wlr17	"Creepy ""neighbors."""	_lobster_	126	22	16	"This was about three years ago.

A friend and I moved into a house on the south end of Seattle, in an industrial district on the Duwamish river.

It was a nice sized two bedroom house and because of the location rent was very cheap. There were few other houses in the area so we thought it would be a great place to host parties, shows, and other various events. Which we did, briefly.

The one issue with this house was that the landlord was currently allowing two people to live in their rv parked in front.

At first things were fine, they were about five years older than us but didn't mind us having people over and for the most part kept to themselves.

Then one night we were having a planning meeting for a sort of ""punk rock swap meet"" that was set to occur at our house.

Bands, record swapping, stuff like that.

Anyway, we're sitting in the living room when the sliding glass door opens and the wife from the rv strolls into our house extremely intoxicated.

She starts yelling at us saying we had no right to be in ""her house.""

Turns out, they had been renting the house but when they became unable to pay the rent our landlord started renting them the rv.

Eventually the husband and daughter who was visiting came over and escorted her out of the house.

We spoke with our landlord and he assured us that he would tell her that if anything like this happened again they would be evicted.

Things were fine for a few weeks until one day when I came home from work to find that the sliding glass door in my room (which was always locked and had been in fact blocked by my desk since the day I moved in) was open and our front door (also always locked) was wide open and my cat was wandering around outside.

I talked to my landlord who then admitted that he never got the keys back from the couple when they moved out and also never changed the locks.

1341713998.0	w7dmv	Don't go outside at 3 AM.	Seanll55	132	28	41	"This is my second post on here, I decided I want to tell my stories through threads to maybe see if some people are like me, or are aware of the dangers in our world. 

It all happened about a week ago, on the first of July. We were hit with an awful storm which knocked out the power and left all of the houses in my town dark. The storm soon passed, and the outside was shockingly clear. 

I thought maybe that the power would come back on around 1 o'clock, 2, but I was wrong. My brother and I were sitting in the dark basically the rest of the night. Mind you, I am a Sophomore in high school, and my brother is a Senior, and we live with our parents, sister, and two pit bull puppies. 

Ryan and I thought it would be fun if we went outside late and sat in the moonlight and told scary stories, I had 20% battery left in my phone, and I decided on playing MrCreepyPasta podcasts for the rest of it's small battery life, so anyways, we were laughing and talking about what would we do in the predicament of the stories. We could clearly see around the yard, the moon was almost full and it was so bright!

It is now 3AM and Ryan and I are quiet just looking around while we sit on the porch. I begin to hear a noise, like gravel moving by footsteps, but really heavy stomping. Ryan claims it is just a car driving slowly, but I continue to listen. I turn of my phone and blow out the small candle we had lit on the cement.

""What the hell?"" He asked.

""Shhh..."" I whispered. I then saw him. Or her, I couldn't see well. I guess it was a man from the way he was walking and motioning. I don't know if he could see us, I hoped he didn't. It was 3AM, who was walking now?

I then realized maybe it could be someone going to work, but had to walk because of a car problem or something, maybe he was just homeless?

I wasn't truly scared until he stopped. He stopped right in front of our house, and turned, just standing there. He had to have seen us. I mean the moon was bright, and with all the power out, maybe we were more visible? Ryan and I froze, just standing there dumbfounded this guy was just watching us. He didn't move, his body a shadow in the night just watching. 

When Ryan and I moved was when he did, he stepped forward abruptly, and Ryan and I booked for the door, forgetting the candle outside. Which made especially creepier is, one, we were listing to Creepypasta stories, two, once we were inside and we closed the door locking the bolt and closing the hatch. 

He stood there for a few minutes, then walked off. He could have still been around our house later that night but we didn't know, we told our parents and they said it would be too stupid to call the police. But they said it was surly freaky. They sat up the rest of the night with us. 


Also, just found out there was an Amber Alert through our area searching for a missing little boy, and his mom. WTF.

I am truly so happy at the success that this subreddit has fallen upon, but there are certain things that you, as writers, need to remember. Also, later in the post I will talk about celebrations!

IF you have a post to share with us, remember these certain rules.

1) This is a non fiction subreddit. All stories told here are TRUE. Unlike /r/nosleep, this is where people come to tell their stories of interactions with terrifying people, not where writers come to fabricate tales of supernatural encounters.

2) This is NOT /r/nosleep.

3) Don't say that your story may not be as scary as others. When a story starts out with ""Sorry, this isn't that scary..."" that ruins the entire atmosphere. This has to stop.

4) Don't beg for karma. Especially not like this: ""I'm new here thought I'd give it a try, please be nice, I suck at writing, sorry I hope it's possible to enjoy this!"" This RUINS the story. Completely. It is also Karmawhoring so don't do it.

So I live in NY and was going into the city to meet my parents after work one day. I think I was about 18 at the time, and I'm female. I was on the subway just getting in to Penn Station and it was extremely crowded, right at rush hour. I sat in one of the seats by the end of the car and the car filled in slowly around me. A man stood directly in front of me and held on to the bar above my head. Immediately I felt very uncomfortable having his crotch literally in my face but I reassured myself, thinking that it was very crowded and he probably didn't mean to do that. I decided to look at him as little as possible, so I instead would look down at the floor and his shoes or to my right out a window across from me. I kept counting the stops, feeling very nervous even though I told myself there was no reason to. So as I was studiously trying not to look at the man in front of me I turned to my left. A man there was looking at me with a very odd expression. It for some reason made me wonder what was going on with the man in front of me so I turned to look...to see out of the corner of my eye that the man had his dick fully out and erect in my face. I panicked. I had no idea what to do. I leaned away from him as much as possible and refused to look at him. I noticed that he kept leaning in with the motions of the car and leaning further into me but I refused to look. I had no idea what to do in this situation. There was nowhere to go, the car was packed. Finally my stop came and I ran off as quickly as possible. I found my mom soon afterward and cried, I was so shocked. We found a police officer and told him about the incident but he wasn't concerned. 
Now I make sure never to sit in the edges of subway cars and next time I will stand up and make a scene rather than sit there. I know this isn't much for most of the posts on Letsnotmeet, but it was really disturbing for me.

TL:DR- A man put his dick in my face while on a crowded subway."	t5_2t3t8	True
1342589592.0	wqusg	The Gas Mask	kitaxhaku	132	33	39	"I did not think I'd ever have anything to put in LetsNotMeet...but tonight I was proven wrong.

I am in summer school in college right now, and I live on campus in a dorm. The dorms have card access, so only students who live there can get in the building. We also live in a small mountain town, so there are very rarely any problems.

Well, I am a girl, and my father raised me to have very quick reflexes to protect myself (he'd literally jump out or wrestle with me until I was 18 to get the message across...he's over 250 pounds and I can beat him in a wrestling/fighting match), so I'm never truly worried about myself.

I've been lurking on letsnotmeet for about a week now, constantly reading EVERYTHING that shows up on this subreddit, so my imagination has been running wild. I also have become more alert around myself.

Now onto the actual story. It was around 12:30am tonight, but I hadn't been paying attention to the time since I was happy and just derping around on the internet. My roommate had left the room, and said she wouldn't be back for a while, so I was taking in the lovely peace and quiet.

Suddenly there was a loud knock on my door. They were solid and loud, as if they were trying to wake me up if I was asleep. I got out of bed and didn't think anything of it, not realizing how late it was. I figured it would be one of my roommate's friends, who sometimes come around to try and find her.

I look in the peephole. I do not recognize this man. He is a college student, I can tell, but something's off. He is looking to the side, like he doesn't want to make eye contact even through the peep hole. I am instantly on alert, but I remind myself that he very well may be an RA, since I noticed there's a lanyard around his neck (no students wear lanyards around there necks here). 

I open the door, and my hands are just coming down from fixing my hair when suddenly someone jumps in front of me. He's wearing a gas mask, and he's leaning in close to me.
I don't scream. Instead, I jump back, but find myself fueled by adrenaline. All I can think is 'I'll get him before he gets me.""

And so when I take a step towards him, and he takes a step back, I lunge at him and punch his arm HARD. I don't recall what happened after that, I was so deep in my mode, but apparently I'd punched him multiple times, leading him half way through the hall in fear.
I see my roommate, who is grinning nervously, and I realize all of this was just a harmless little prank. I'm shaking from the rush, and I step back into my room, shaking my head. My roommate apologizes, saying that she thought I'd just scream and laugh about it. Some of her friends had found the gas mask, and wanted to see how many people they could scare. I ended up scaring them more.

Apparently I'd taken the advice from a thread on here of looking terrifying and angry, because the guy I had punched had taken off the mask and was shaking in a corner. We all laughed about it after I explained why I had seemed so angry (they thought I was insulted and really angry, when in reality I was only trying to protect myself).

In the end it was harmless, but I left the situation learning that I can truly protect myself, even if for a little.

EDIT: Oh, and apparently as I went after him, I screamed ""come here you little shit!"""	t5_2t3t8	True
1342230834.0	wj4gu	Mini Manson	amanda_pandemonium	132	30	40	"Recently, family friend of my parents asked me to babysit for her, since she and her husband were working. I was supposed to be there every day from Monday-Friday, 8 a.m.-5 p.m., and I agreed, since I was broke, and it was only for a week. 

Some back-story:
I've known Dawn, the mom, George, her husband, Charlie, her thirteen year old, and Austin, her twelve year old, since I was about six.  My parents are close to Dawn and George, and I've been babysitting for her since I was old enough. 
About three years ago, they adopted Tommy from Guatemala when he was eight. Since he got to the states, it's been apparent that he has some issues from his awful life in the orphanage, and before it. He'd scream until he threw up when Dawn and George left, scared that they wouldn't come back to him. Seeing him so scared and sad, well, he's always had a special place in my heart. He's eleven now, and a part of the family, more or less. 
Charlie and Austin have never liked him much, but that's understandable, since he instigates, lies, steals, and breaks their things. All that slowed down, and then stopped, but he had caused them a significant amount of problems, damn near tore their family apart. 

Fast forward three years, the two boys tolerate him, but Dawn and George, I've noticed, are always tense around him. Whatever, they're stressed and busy, no big deal. 

The first four days I watched them weren't bad, only a few minor fights over something on Minecraft. 

Today was my last day, and I was planning on using the time while I'm stuck there to work on some notes for my AP history class. 

Nope. 

Turns out, today was the day no one wanted to get along. Everyone is yelling, Tommy and Austin are in hysterics and snotting on themselves (and me) while trying to tell me why they're crying, and Charlie is hiding in his room playing COD. 

And they're out of coffee, meaning it was going to be an even longer day for me. 

I separate the boys, making them all go start on chores right away even though it's only 8:30 in the morning. Everything is quiet, peaceful, and shit is getting done. 

And then my headphones break.

It's still quiet though, so I figured whatever, I can deal with cartoons in the background while I take my notes. Pretty soon Charlie and Austin are done with their chores and want breakfast. I make some, and check on Tommy who has gotten practically nothing done so far. 

Tommy then starts complaining about how he always has more chores than Charlie and Austin, and how everyone hates him and no one listens. It's far from true, which I gently explained, but he DOES have more chores than his two brothers today, so I offer to help him fold the laundry so long as he promises to behave today. 

Charlie and Austin wander back to the living room/kitchen area to return dishes, and almost instantly T starts to rag on them calling them ""Meg"" (from Family Guy), and generally being an asshat of a little kid. I make him finish the folding on his own (which was about two towels). 

Then he starts saying that I hate him, I don't listen to him, he hates me, I don't care what happens to him, etc. I replied, rather calmly, ""Tommy, I want you to listen. I know you're just being dramatic, and I know that you know none of this is true. Calm down, take a deep breath, try to stop crying, ok?""

Hysterics continue.

By this time, my patience is wearing thin, so I tell him to go hang out in his room for about twenty minutes and try to calm down. Since I always feel bad yelling at the boys, or being the mean babysitter, I let him take his iPod touch to play around on while he's calming down.

Then I go downstairs, thank the other two for being good, and let them know Tommy is calming down and to just avoid him when he comes down so that no one ends up in tears. They agreed (but probably had no idea what they were agreeing to since they were playing COD). 

After fifteen minutes, I start to feel bad and think I overreacted, and go upstairs to see how Tommy is doing and end his time-out. 

When I walk in, he's laying between his bed and the wall, almost hidden from view, in about a foot and a half of space between the two. He's also singing along to a pop song and wearing nothing but boxers, and was rolling around on the floor rubbing his front side on it. 

He didn't look up or anything when I called his name, so I just figured he had his headphones on and didn't notice me.

I walk over and sit on the edge of his bed. From where I am, I can see the screen on his iPod, and see what looks like a murder scene or something weird on his screen. Then I notice it's kind of grainy, and really poor quality. 

It's a snuff film.

 Then, thoroughly freaked the fuck out, I tapped his shoulder to get his attention. Previous to this, he hadn't been able to see me where he was laying. He jumped, hid the screen, and hit the exit button. 

""Tommy, what were you watching?""
""Nothing!""
""Give me the iPod.""

I walk into the hallway, and then I go to his history, and find the most horrendous shit on the internet in that list. Enough to legitimately terrify me more than anything on /b/ ever could.

There was hentai (which is odd for an 11 year old, but whatever). Then I find extreme torture/gore videos and pictures, what I think may have been child porn, beastiality videos, rape scenarios, and a shit ton of snuff films. 

Stupidly, I take the iPod downstairs and set it on the counter in the kitchen because I don't want to have it near me. 

Later on, I find him with it, ask for it back, check the history again hoping it wasn't deleted, and find that it has been.

1342007023.0	wdpiy	The creeper with the fake booze. 	lamasgrande	126	28	18	"So when I turned 18 - the legal age to drink and go to clubs in my country- a friend of mine decided to take me around some of the city clubs. We ended up at this place that was popular because it was cheap and there was no cover fee. 


I'm sitting there, definitely NOT having a good time, since the music was bad, there were barely any people left and my friend is hooking up with some guy. Then this other guy, with an all douche appearance - tight shirt, unbuttoned all the way down to his belly button, some long heavy necklace around his neck, too much hair products - comes and tries to strike a conversation  with me. I didn't feel like talking to him, and he said ""hey, you know, instead of getting bored by yourself, why don't you get bored... with me?"", I still couldn't get him to leave, so my friend told him that my (non existent) boyfriend was in the bathroom. 


He apologized, left but kept an eye on us. After realizing there was no boyfriend, he came back. I can't remember much of the conversation - it was years ago and not interesting, just stupid and he demanded to know why my friend lied to him about me having a boyfriend, and that he could go into the bathroom to find him for me unless of course the said boyfriend was a lie, in which case I had to give him an explanation on why I lied to him- but my friend and I did not want to talk to this guy, he was weird, so my friend told him that we were lesbians and we hugged each other... Yeah, not a smart trick... and he said he respected people like us, and that he had brought a drink for us. Back then, I didn't use to drink but there was something very strange about his drink: it wasn't in one of the club's glasses, but just a plastic one, like the ones you get at a convenience store. I had a fake ID since I was 17, and used to club a bit, and never saw any club where they would give you cheap small plastic glasses instead of those made of  real glass, not to mention that no one else in the club was drinking from any glass similar to that one. It was also full to the top, another strange thing.... So I declined, but my friend who was much more adventurous took a very good sip of it. We decided to leave, since the club wasn't getting any better and the guy wouldn't leave us alone. 


It was a 15 minute ride to my friends place, and a little before we got there, she started complaining about an awful headache. Now, it wasn't my friend's first drink ever, and she had been drunk a few times before that night. She said it was deep and it didn't feel like a ""natural"" headache she had ever had before, and was pretty sure it had been the guys drink.

What was in it? we'll never know.

1336977585.0	tm4iz	I always lock the doors now.	equalitarianism	127	28	19	"In 2009, I was living with my aunt and uncle in Florida, but my uncle had gone up north to visit family and would be gone for several weeks, so it was just my aunt and I. She has rheumatoid arthritis and has had several hip surgeries and is on a lot of medication, so I had to keep an eye on her, go to town for her and whatever else. 

I was dead asleep in my bed, but for some reason I started to wake up because I felt that I was “being watched”. I opened my eyes a little bit, looking towards my sliding glass door that goes out to the pool in the yard, then looked at the side of the bed I was already facing (I never moved my head) and I saw a figure crouched down by my bed. At first, I didn't react, thinking it was just my imagination, but as I became less foggy in my little brain I started to realize it was a PERSON a PERSON was in my room, staring at me. 

I shot up in my bed, still staring at the figure and I started screaming, but not for long. The figure got up on top of me, pushing me to the bed covering my mouth. I started thrashing around trying to get them off of me, kicking, and just being all around difficult because no way in hell was I gonna die. 

Then, they started to talk to me in a hushed tone, “shhh, baby! It's just me.”

It was my “boyfriend”. Mind you, I broke it off with this person, took them to a city that was a good two and a half hours away by car to his friend's. I broke up with him because he was abusive, stole from me and my aunt and uncle. He threatened to kill me and my family if I ever decided to leave him. Oh, and he WALKED to the house, he did it because he loves me – at least, that's what he said.

That's all that I could think of. He was going to kill me and my aunt and it would be my fault.

I stopped screaming, he uncovered my mouth and kept telling me how much he loved me and how much he cared for me, would NEVER do anything to hurt me and all that other fun stuff.

I'm still scared out of my mind, but I convince him that I'm okay, everything is fine and we'll all be happy. 

He stayed with me all night, sleeping next to me and I'm up wide-eyed, paranoid. Morning came and I told him he had to leave before my aunt woke up and I'd be in trouble. He calls his friend and leaves.

(I look around the house to see where he got in – it was through the screened area that's over the pool, cut a hole above the latch to the door and through the sliding glass door that is never locked.)

Now, I'm going to tell you something and you're going to think I'm stupid: I ended up getting back with him, but because I became terrified for myself and my family and I needed to protect them. I would stay with him because that was what he wanted. The longer I stayed the worse I would get hurt by him and we ended up being homeless sleeping in a Krogers parking lot for months because if he was going to break into a house, after walking all night just to get to me, who knows what else he would do.

I did end up leaving him though, still scared that he would hurt me and all I knew, giving me threatening phone calls telling me he knew where my friends lives, would kill my cats, my ex-boyfriends and the like. What cemented my leaving him was because I finally broke down and sort of told my dad what was going on and he explained to me that I was always safe at home. I seemed to forget the fact that my dad has 50+ guns. 

I still get e-mails from him sometimes, asking me how I am. I never respond.

Also, before you mention the cops – I told them he was stalking me, but I didn't have enough proof and when he beat me outside of the police station and the homeless shelter (right across from each other), we were just told to move the truck because we parked there too long. Yeah, never really bothered with going to the cops again for help."	t5_2t3t8	True
1330457372.0	qa2gk	[MY] Story - Almost Raped, Murdered, Robbed 	GotMeaGunBitches	115	12	56	"I just found this subreddit though another posting thanks to the shameless plug by a mod (thanks mod!).  I just finished a few hours of reading harrowing stories and I've decided to finally get this off my chest. 

This is a throwaway account because I don't want.. I mean.. yeah.  You'll see. 

This happened to me on Friday, December 23, 2011, just a few months ago.  I am a white female in my early 40's and I live in an urban area known for violence but I live in a rather decent part of town on a quiet, dead-end street. 

It was early evening but dark outside &amp; I was at my car parked in my driveway.  I was cleaning out my car because I was about to take some people to the airport and I was trying to hide the fact that my car can get rather messy.  I have 2 dogs, that's my excuse and I'm sticking to it.   I'm was just finishing up when a car drives up the street past me, turns around in the culdesac and the drops someone off about 2 houses up from me. 

I noticed the car. I noticed the man - but ZERO red flags were raised because I thought he'd been dropped off and was going into a nearby house.  Also, he was incredibly casual.  It's the one thing I feel shame in regards to this whole situation - that he didn't raise any flags inside me. How could I have been so obtuse? I know better.   

I walk from my driveway, around the front landscaped area and to my stairs.  I had heard him behind me, but assumed he was just walking down the sidewalk to pass me.  Just about the time I got to my stairs, the hair on my neck stood up and I got goosebumps.  I tried to turn around, but it was too late.  One hand grabbed my shoulder and one hand pressed something HARD into my back and he kept me in the forward facing position. 

He was taller than me and I felt him lean down to whisper, ""Shut up or get cut.""  I could smell booze on his breath and I could tell he was a black guy from his tone? Voice? words?   Let me tell you that being stabbed or killed with a knife is honestly my absolute worse fear of fears.  I've always had nightmares about getting stabbed to death.   I had JUST been to the bathroom a few minutes before, but I was so scared that, even so, I let go of a tiny bit of urine.  I wish my bladder had been full, maybe he would have been disgusted and run off. 

He kept hold of my shoulder, kept something in my back and he pushed me upstairs and into my house.    As we got inside I tried to say something, hoping my tenant was home who lives across the hall in his own unit, but he said, ""SHUT UP!"" through clenched teeth.  The tenant wasn't home, anyway. 

I live alone with 2 dogs, though both of them were frolicking in the back yard and didn't come inside while this was going on.  I'm glad of that because my littlest one (20 lbs) is a fearless little fucker &amp; would have bit the shit out of the guy &amp; might have gotten hurt or killed.  Little guy actually did bite a mugger once, but that's another story.  My lab would have run over for pets because she loves absolutely everyone, even rapists. 

Once he pushed me into the house &amp; looked around (while still holding me) I could tell that he was disappointed because I heard him say ""shit"" under his breath.  I don't have a flat screen TV or other fancy equipment.  I live simply &amp; frugally.  I have a 15 year old tube TV, a Wii (both of which live in a closet), a 20 year old bookshelf CD/Radio player and a MacBook, that's it!  I don't do Christmas so there was no tree &amp; no presents, either.

He pushed me into the bedroom, which is right off the living room (no hallway between them) and then shoved me away from him toward my bed.  I remained standing, but I finally got to turn around.  I was terrified to LOOK at him in the eye, I didn't want to aggravate him. I concentrated on his shoes.  His very distinctive shoes that I was able to later identify. 

I also got a look at the HUGE mother fucking knife he was holding and a new wave of adrenaline shot through  me and made my eyes kind of blurry, I felt dizzy, I felt like I couldn't get enough air but I was breathing heavily at the same time.  My knees felt week, I felt my insides were jelly and that I was going to vomit.   I've never been more scared in my life than that moment.  I told him to take whatever he wanted but please leave me alone.  

He said, ""Take off your pants"" and he stuck his hands down HIS pants to start rubbing himself. 

I said, ""Ok, but I have AIDS, you need to use a condom. I have some.""  (I don't, but I was hoping to avoid getting an STD or AIDS if I survived this.)

He smirked, ""I've heard THAT one before. Get 'em off."" 

And two thoughts went through my head at the same time: He's done this before.  God damn, he's calm.   

And he was calm.  He wasn't breathing heavily, he voice wasn't strained, he wasn't sweating. This was just another day at the office for this waste of human flesh. 

And just then, by the way he was saying things, something about his tone and his attitude, I absolutely knew he was going to rape THEN murder me, then rob me, in that order.  Dead Certain.  I've never been more sure of anything.

Then the oddest thing happened.  In the space of about 3 seconds I calmed right the fuck down.  I got CLARITY -  My mind was clear, clean, I could see, taste, smell, think, LIKE A GOD (or goddess in this case). I realize it was just the adrenaline but I've never felt anything like it.  I stopped shaking.  I stood there marveling at this new feeling for a moment before he repeated the order to take off my pants. 

So I did. In the time it took me to take off my pants, I had already formulated a plan because it was only then I remembered something that was nearby.  I was about to get all sweet &amp; coy ""I'm so glad you came over tonight, I'm so horny.. and god I love big black cock..""  etc.. etc..  

The plan was to lay down on the bed while talking to him and then reach wait for the right moment to pull out my MOTHER FUCKING GUN that I have attached to a custom holster on the back of the nightstand.  I was going to shoot him point blank in the temple if I had to. 

I didn't have to do that because as soon as I took off my pants, I think he thought he had me under control because it was HIS turn to do the oddest thing - he turned around and started rummaging in the living room, opening the china cabinet and closet.   

He was only out of my line of sight for about 3 seconds but that gave me enough time to reach for the gun.  It's a .38 revolver with no funny business about cocking it or safeties.. it's just point 'n pull the trigger. 

I had the gun raised and leveled at him by the time he came back to the doorway and my hands were NOT shaking, I said, ""You better get out of here Mother Fuc...""  I didn't get a chance to finish the sentence because he reacted instantly, ""OH SHEET"" as he headed for the door faster than could be believed.

I followed him out, locked the door, went to put on pants then called the police.  Though the police got there within a few minutes, alas they were unable to catch the guy.  He still hasn't been caught and I doubt he will be. They were unable to lift prints on the very few things he touched. 

I was completely unhurt physically &amp; mentally, I'm recovering just fine. 

A few addendum points &amp; asides: 

I owe the story of my survival to my good friend Michael (RIP) who willed me his gun when he died a number of years ago.   He didn't like that I lived alone in the urban area that I do.   Thank you, Michael, wherever you are.   I love you guy, and I miss you terribly.   Thank you for saving my life from the grave. 

I also owe the story of my survival to the custom holster I had made and then installed on the back of my nightstand so that it was both hidden and within easy reach.  The total cost was $100 for everything and I wish I'd done it sooner.  I've had this gun for a number of years and always kept it in the back of the top shelf in the closet.  Had it still been there in the closet, I never would have gotten to it on time. 

Yes, I know that I COULD have shot him and technically I SHOULD have shot him since he was in my house and about to rape/murder/rope me and within 21 feet of me.  However, I'm satisfied that I gave him a warning and the opportunity to save his own life. (Hey, I'm a damn good shot, I practice!)  I think I would be much worse off psychologically if I killed him, for I am not a killer.  It would be tough for me to live with that. 

That said, I also learned something valuable about myself &amp; I think it's the best thing to come out of this experience:  At the gun safety class I took and the private instructor I got lessons from all said the same thing to a female who was scared of guns at first:   Don't pick up a gun and point it at someone unless you know you can do it, otherwise the bad guy will take it away and use it on YOU.

As a female who has never pointed a gun at anyone and only used it on the range, you just can't know what you can do until the moment comes, if it ever even comes and we hope it doesn't.  Well, I know in my heart that had he come toward me instead of going left toward the front door, I WOULD have emptied the gun into him.  No question. No hesitation or reservation.  I'm glad I know that now.  I hope I never have to use that knowledge. 


EDIT: I know I've already written a wall of text, but god damn I feel really god for having written this out and told my story.   I honestly haven't told that many friends, etc.. I didn't want to advertise to them that I had a gun or where it was located.  Thanks for listening.

1374767399.0	1j17mx	Stalked by Jeff Goldblum's doppleganger	YasashiiKaze	122	23	12	"   When I was 21 I fell on hard times and had to move to a shelter for a few weeks. At the time I was working several part-time jobs, one of which involved meeting our team at different stores around town for overnight inventories. The town was pretty decent-sized with a population of around 60,000 and since I didn't have a car, I walked to each location.

   Being homeless was a new experience for me and as a single female on my own, I was on my guard around the men from the mission. I didn't speak to them for the most part and when I wasn't working, was often assigned cleaning chores either on my own or with other women. The sleeping quarters were separated into men's and women's but all other common areas were integrated.

   About a week after my arrival, a guy in his mid-forties came up to me on mission property while I was cleaning and struck up a conversation. Now normally I am terrible with faces, but this guy left an impression because he looked exactly like a creepy version of Jeff Goldblum. If I ever actually knew his name I’ve forgotten it, so let’s use Jeff. He started out with “Hi,” and while I was avoiding certain situations, I’m also not a complete ass. I said “Hi,” back and he just kind of hung around. He asked me a couple of other, non-personal questions before informing me that he would be getting an apartment soon and would I be interested in moving in with him?

   I had literally never spoken to this guy before and only seen him around during meals. I have no idea what made him think I would be agreeable. I told him no, I wasn’t looking to get an apartment with anyone else, let alone a guy I didn’t know, and he wandered off.

   After that, Jeff started showing up randomly during my walks to various jobsites. He didn’t get his apartment while I lived at the mission, but once informed me quite proudly that he had saved up enough for a motel room and would I come over? I firmly told him no, that I had a job to get to, and walked away. He would always follow along for a short while but never very far and never showed any signed of aggression or violence so I viewed him as more of a nuisance than anything.

   Eventually I was able to trade my part-time jobs in for one full-time position. It was as a cashier at a local fast food joint in the mall, but I worked enough hours that I was able to put money aside for an apartment and moved out of the mission shortly afterwards. I always worked lunch hours when we were completely slammed and between my runner (employee who gets drinks, salads, etc. so those handling money do not also handle food) and I we once earned our store a 98% out of a possible 100% during our busiest hours. This was a big deal to me at the time.

   One day Jeff appeared in my line (there were two) during the lunch rush. When it came his turn to order, he struck up a conversation instead of ordering anything. I asked him politely a couple of times if I could take his order. I was trying to stay professional as any one of our customers could be a secret shopper and it was important to us that we maintain our high score. He refused to order anything and instead kept trying to talk to me. When I told him if he wasn’t going to order, he needed to let the next person in line come forward, he moved aside but attempted to speak over the next customer. At this point I realized I wasn’t going to be able to avoid being rude to him since he was being rude to my other customers so I told him very flatly, “You need to leave. Not even my friends are allowed to visit with me while I’m working.”

   Jeff lost it. It may have been the insinuation that I did not consider him a friend (which of course I didn’t; I didn’t even know him) but he started screaming and swearing and even attempted to come over the counter at me. Immediately my runner, the other cashier and the other runner came to my aid and we all informed Jeff that if he did not leave right this second, security would be called.

   With that he just stopped screaming and walked away. I only saw him one other time after that. He brought another woman who looked about his age with him and they bought lunch from the other cashier. He then proceeded to glare at me the entire time they sat in the food court and ate.

1372483650.0	1haphj	I've never been this afraid of work before	stephope	134	31	30	"Hi everyone! This happened to me literally two hours ago as I was closing up at work and I’m still a little shook up about it.

Wall of text!

I work in a pretty well-known amusement park in the US and part of my job every night is to shut down the park. This means that me and three of my coworkers all walk to the back of the park, split up, and walk back on our separate routes until we meet up again at the park entrance.

Anyway, one of my coworkers split off early to do her route, and the rest of us walked to the back of the park. About halfway there, we met up with these two guys, one super tall and one short, who looked like they were heading out of the park. They actually asked us how to leave and we told them. However, instead of just leaving then and there, like most people do, they stayed. The short one was standing behind one of my coworkers and the tall one directly in front of her. The tall one leaned down (my coworker is like 4’11) and pointed to the pin he was wearing on his shirt, and began telling her that “someone” told him that if he was wearing that pin it meant that we all had to give them a hug—which is NOT true, it’s actually in our job description not to touch a guest under any circumstance if we can help it as it could result in us being fired. While he was doing this, his short friend started batting at my coworker’s hair playfully. Like, what? After what seemed like forever but was probably like 2 minutes, they left for, what we assumed was the exit.

We did our routes as normal, but I know I was extra cautious doing mine, especially while clearing the men’s bathrooms just in case they came back. I got to the end of my route without incident and waited for the rest of my coworkers. At this point it had been about an hour since everything had happened.

So I was standing there and I noticed the tall one walking over to me. Obviously it doesn’t take an hour to walk out of the park so of course I was creeped out, and I was by myself this time. It was well lit, but there weren’t a lot of people around.

Anyway, he came up to me and started talking, whatever. He was saying my name a lot (we have nametags so he could obviously read it) and he kept asking if I was a manager because I had a radio. I’m not, we just need them to clear the park. I told him so and he asked me if I liked being along in the park at night. Um, not right now, no. He also kept staring directly at my chest. He did not make eye contact once.

He finally left me alone and my coworkers got back from their routes. They had apparently also creeped on the coworker who had split off from the rest of the group after we had given them directions out of the park (which explains what they were doing for that hour). We were all really nervous at this point, but we felt better that we were all together.

We finished clearing the last section of the park when I looked over to the main entrance and realized THEY WERE STILL THERE. They were talking to my OTHER coworkers whose job it was to wave and say goodnight to everyone leaving the park. After they finally left (thanks to our lovely security guards) we found out that these guys, who were in their thirties, had actually asked out two of my coworkers (both 19) and had actually gone so far as to ask them if they had boyfriends and if they loved them and why.

Our security guards told us that if they tried to bother us at the bus stop to call them and they would take care of them. Luckily we didn’t have to do that.

I used to love clearing the park, but I’m downright freaked out right now.

Thanks for reading!

TL;DR: A couple of guys freak out my coworkers and I, don’t leave the park for an hour and a half, and basically stalk all of us until security kicks them out.

1369963285.0	1fdjx1	Worst hike of my life....	lostspiral	151	50	77	"A little back story first.. I'm 21 years old. Played lacrosse for 4 years in high school. Usually don't have any type of fear unless it comes to firearms, gangs, etc.


Last summer me and 3 other friends (2 girls and 1 guy) get bored from sitting around and getting high and decide to go for a hike. I tell them I know of this spot out in the countryside where the river meets a creek, you can cross it and there's a hiking trail that leads up the mountain to a small pond. We go by the gas station on our way and get smokes and some snacks and drinks for the hike.

 No problemos, steady and smooth vibes on the drive there. When we pull up there is 2 women walking close to the entrance of the trail.. they look extremely nervous but we don't pay attention due to being high. I light up a cigarette and one of the girls asks for one.. I gave her one and couldn't help to notice that she had the longest dirtiest nails I've ever seen. I didn't pay any real notice to it and just figured they were drifters or hippies or whatever.

 We head off on the trail and everything is going good. About 15 minutes from the pond, we see 3 men down the side of the trail standing and looking at a hole in the ground. You can tell it's a hole from where we're at.. probably 50-100 ft away. Just standing and staring. They know we're there because we're being loud and laughing etc. We all saw and thought it was creepy as fuck but kept walking. We get to the pond and have a sit for a smoke and a blunt. As we're smoking my friend is walking close to us but also close to the pond just scanning the bank for neat stuff. 

He finds a hatchet.. a clean, almost too clean hatchet almost 90% burried in the bank. Next to it about 5 ft. away is a can of empty acetone and a ziploc bag filled to the top with blood. My buddy played lacrosse with me and doesn't get spooked but as you can imagine anyone would be mindfucked at this point.. he comes over without saying anything at first and just sits down. After we get done smoking he's like hey guys come look at this.. shows us the hatchet acetone and bag of blood. The girls turn away and get really freaked out.. one of the girls threw up. I take my shirt off and use it to pick the hatchet up in case it's like a murder weapon.. fingerprints etc.. but it's completely clean.. i'm assuming it's what the acetone was for. The buddy didn't notice but on the bag of blood there was #19 written in sharpie on the bag. I get freaked out and suggest that we just leave it alone and leave.


On our way back to the trail I see one of the men that we saw earlier coming out of the brush a couple feet to the side of the trail.. he looks frantic and is sweating heavily. I say what's up to him just trying to come off non hostile.. He asks me what we're doing up here and I told him we just came for a hike and a smoke. I ask him the same question and he said he's lost his keys last night on a hike and came back looking for them. I know it's the guy we saw earlier because of the jacket he had on.. same dude 100%. The other 2 guys were missing. He looks at one of the girls (the one that got sick) and asks her what's wrong and if he can do anything to help her.. My buddy told him to fuck off that we didn't want any trouble.. the dude agrees after looking us both up and down a couple times. He starts to walk behind us pretending like he's looking on the ground but I can tell that he's looking at us out of the corner of his eye. We say fuck it and take off down the trail.. he doesn't follow us so I figured he was just mental or being creepy or whatever. 


We're about 20 ft. from the beginning of the trail when I see the other 2 guys sitting by our car and looking inside of it. I tell the girls to wait by a bench and me and my buddy walk up to them and ask whats going on.. they both look at us with the most evil fucking eyes I've ever seen.. the smaller of the 2 guys starts to walk towards my buddy with a smile on his face and asks how he'd like to see his 2 little friends over there get fucked by some real men. I know it's fucked up but as soon as he finishes his sentence I cold cock'd him in the jaw.. He wasn't even looking nor talking to me but I just had this feeling.. the guy that was still up against the car started to reach for something in his pocket and my buddy took his feet out from under him and slammed him to the ground.. just about the same time that I hear the girls scream.. I look back and sure enough the fucker in the jacket is about 6 ft. from the bench.. they unlock the car and run over to us and get in.. the smaller dude is still on the ground and the other guy is getting his shit rocked by my buddy.. The dude in the jacket comes up to me and hits me.. Im kinda shook or whatever but I tackled him and started wailing on him. My buddy comes up and kicks him hard as fuck.. like I'm pretty sure he broke something in the dudes face when he kicked him because dudes head just tilted to the side and his eyes closed.. we got up and left.


None of us say anything about it on the way home.. 3 days later one of the girls calls me up and says that 2 kids from our local elementary school had gone missing the same day this happened. They lived within 2-5 miles of the hiking spot. None of us has ever said a word about what happened or know anything. 


We all agreed that if we went to the police then something would be turned around on us.
Not sure if this is creepy to you guys or just a hero story. But I was freaked the fuck out. If i hadn't have hit the first guy and the dude would have got to the girls who knows what would have happened.



Moral of the story and tldr ; Don't go any further down a trail if you see creepy mother fuckers. Vibes can tell you everything!!"	t5_2t3t8	True
1367398053.0	1dgzop	Tried to help out a friend who was being followed around; really wish I hadn't.	Hapoobah	127	22	10	"This happened when I was in the eighth grade.

My neighbour, Kari, and I used to attend the same after-school math classes, about a 15 minute walk away from our houses. We had to attend it around four times a week and we would always walk there and back together.

One day, after class, a friend of ours comes up to us looking really freaked out. She points at two guys on a motorcycle across the road and tells us that they have been following her around nearly everyday. She would find them waiting for her wherever she went and then they wouldn't leave her alone, following her all the way home. (This was when we were 13 years old, so of course we only ever hung out within walking distance of our houses, and were fairly easy to follow) She was particularly freaked out that day because they had a laser pointer which they were directing at her boobs. She only lived a few minutes away, and we decided to walk her home so she would feel safer.

The guys follow us, obviously. They do nothing overtly creepy at first. They just keep driving next to us, very slowly, always within ten feet of us. If they ever overtook us, they would turn around and come back, eventually circling around us. We thought they would be put off by our presence, and at first it did seem to throw them off. 

We drop her home and start walking back to our house, and lo and behold! The creepy bastards are now following US home! Over the next few weeks we would always see them waiting for us outside class, driving up and down the road next to us, following us home. They never came too close or said anything to us, but they were always THERE. We would take alternative routes home, and go into shops or cafes to shake them off so they could never actually follow us home. But every day, after class, they would be there, waiting for us. We told all the security guards around about them, and for a while they manged to stop them, but the guys just started waiting for us in a different place.

I don't remember how long this went on exactly, a few weeks at least. At some point I think they got bored of us or found a new victim. For some reason though, neither Kari nor I told our parents about this. I think it was a mixture of wanting to deal with it ourselves and the fear/shame of telling our family we were being stalked. It was a cowardly move on both our parts I guess, since we knew for a fact we weren't the only ones they were harassing, but we were just relieved they had finally left us alone!!"	t5_2t3t8	True
1363570393.0	1ahxxh	Followed for 10 miles	YoukoAlicia	125	21	21	"I haven't really thought about this in a while, but reading other people's stories made me remember it. 

One night in early 2012, my girlfriend and I went out with a friend. I don't remember everything that we did that night, but the last thing we did before we dropped our friend off was go out to eat. It was late, probably about 2am. When we pulled out of the parking lot to leave, a car pulled out behind us. As we went our way, it followed. We were in a busy part of town, so we didn't think much about it. However, my girlfriend is cautious about things like that. So, instead of going the most common route to drop our friend off at her car, she decided to cut through. It's mostly a woodsy area, but there are several houses spread out and in one spot there are some business-type buildings. We almost never see anyone driving there, especially at night. Well, when we turned, so did the car behind us. No big deal, maybe they live on one of these roads. Every turn we made, the car made. It was starting to weird me out. Luckily our friend was still oblivious.

I'll break here to say my girlfriend is a speed demon. She drives like a bat outta hell. She started slowly picking up speed and the car did too. Finally, she said, “Fuck this” and she floored it. I don't remember how fast we were going, I just know it was faster than what she usually drives on those roads and faster than what was safe. Anyway, this car is doing it's best to keep up with us. Even when we go down the road with the business buildings instead of the one with the houses, the car still follows us. By now our friend realizes what's going on and she's freaking out in the back seat. We finally get back to the main road and we don't see the car anymore.

We get to my friend's work parking lot where she left her car and we're sitting there for a few minutes trying to get her to calm down so she can drive home. The same damn car pulls into the parking lot with us. We sit there for a few minutes just trying to figure out what these guys are pulling. About a minute later, another car pulls in and parks right across from the other car. The guys in both cars get out and are standing there staring at us. My girlfriend started the car again and they got into the first car (the one that was following us). As we pulled out of the parking lot, I made sure I got a good look at their faces so I'd know them. We go across the street to a diner we frequented because it was the only place open on that side of town at that time of night and I've always been told go where there are people. We were also hoping our favorite waitress would be there to tell her about this weirdness.

She wasn't there so the three of us head to the bathroom and between waiting in line and talking (to each other and to some of the women waiting) it takes us about 10 minutes. When we walk out the doors that sectioned off the bathrooms from the rest of the diner, they were sitting in the booth directly across from the doors and they were staring. My girlfriend and I noticed them, our friend didn't. We got out of there and went back to the car. The whole time they watched us through the windows. They had even parked right beside our car. We got in the car, locked the doors, and went back to drop our friend off. I wouldn't let her get out of the car until I made sure nobody was lurking. I told her to go straight home, to make sure she wasn't being followed, and to let us know when she got home and was inside. We went back to the diner parking lot to make sure the guys were still there, which they were. We were there maybe two minutes then we left. The whole way home we were checking to make sure we weren't being followed.

This is (so far) the creepiest thing that has happened to me that involved people. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1354686254.0	14b4qo	Just an average summer day...	34kitten92	123	24	6	"So, this happened back when I was probably a 3rd or 4th grader (I'm a junior in college now). I grew up in a moderately wealthy neighborhood where everyone was friendly to one another and nothing bad ever really happened. Before this instance, the worst thing that had happened was that a rabid fox was roaming around. In my cul-de-sac, all of the kids close to my age were boys, and my only female neighborhood friend lived on a different street. So clearly, she and I had a secret hang-out spot that the boys weren't allowed in, particularly the boy that lived next door to her because we disliked him. My parents had told me time and time again that we weren't allowed in the woods behind our house without an adult present because there was a stream back there that got fairly deep in places and lots of ways to get hurt. This particular summer, my dad was building our swing set, so he was outside along with one of his brothers, thus allowing us to be playing in the woods. 

So Tina and I decided to finally show some of the boys we were closest to our secret hang-out spot. We're back there, playing some foolish, childhood game for quite some time when I noticed someone approaching us from the depths of the woods (they weren't really that deep of woods, but my point is that this person was coming from the opposite direction of our neighborhood and my house). They were too far away to see clearly, and I pointed this figure out to the gathered children. Then I saw something shiny in their hand. At this point, they were moving towards us rather rapidly and it was apparent it was a male. My friend, Keith, assumed it was the neighborhood boy no one liked and yelled out, ""Daniel, stop trying to scare us!"" This didn't halt the man one bit, and I suddenly saw the ""shiny"" object in great detail and realized it was a giant knife. I screamed bloody murder and took off like a bat out of hell, with everyone close on my heels.

Let me pause for a moment, dear Redditors, so you can understand just how difficult this was. My house is built on a hill made of fill dirt. You come in the front door, on ground level, and you can leave through the basement door, also on ground level. On the right hand side of my house, the hill that leads into the woods is a small, gradual slope and not a big deal. On the left hand side, it is one steep motherfucker. My dad refuses to cut the grass there because the probability of the lawn mower tipping over is basically 100%. This is the hill we had to climb to get out of our secret hang-out spot. Normally, none of us even attempt to walk up the hill because it's almost a useless endeavor and we can cut through the woods and come out by the smaller hill instead. But when fleeing in terror, this didn't occur to anyone. Our hang-out spot was maybe a 2 minute walk from the edge of the woods, and I swear, we made it out of the woods and up the hill in under a minute. We then ran up the second hill to get to my front yard, where my mom was sitting with my aunt and told them what happened. We got laughed at, and reminded that it was probably just someone in the neighborhood playing a joke on us for excluding them. Logical, sure. So we go around back to see how my dad is progressing with the swing set and if we can play with any of the cool power tools, at this point, having written off the person as Daniel, because he was the only person we ever excluded. Lo and behold, Daniel is on the swing set, helping my dad build it. Creepy, but whatever, right? Maybe he got there before we did by just coming right out of the woods. Eventually, we all forgot about the incident and went about our summer as normal.

A month later, the road next to Tina's house is littered with cops. Next to her house is this small gorge where the stream runs under the road through a large pipe. We found out that night, that there had been an escapee from the local mental hospital (which is just down the road from us) living in that pipe. We don't know what was wrong with the man, but the police found a bunch of animal bones down there and a lot of blood, along with hunting gear. 

TL;DR: We were playing in the woods behind my house, saw a man with a knife. Wrote it off as a childish prank, month later found out a mental hospital escapee had been living in a pipe next to my best friend's house and had lots of animal bones and blood and hunting equipment. "	t5_2t3t8	True

Because just thinking about what i'm going to write makes me sick.  I made this throwaway, because even after years of therapy and medications, I am still extremely paranoid.  What happened to me was because of my own fault, and has changed me extremely.  

When I say this is my own fault is because, in ways, it is.  I was the one to sneak out at night, to take midnight walks.  I lived in a pretty urban neighborhood, which wasn't really known for being good. some things happened around there, but nothing like rape or murder, or anything on those lines.  Not until me, of course.  Sorry if i babble, this is my first time writing about what happened, so panic is kind of close to bubbling over right now.

I have insomnia.  I've had it since 6th grade, when my parents divorced.  I wake up at 2:30 mosts nights, or somewhere around there.  Sometimes i can go back to sleep.  Most nights i can go back to sleep in around 20 minutes, but rest is usually waking up every hour or so and then falling right back to sleep.  That night, i couldn't.  For the fear he might find me again, i cannot say anything about when or where or who, because if i did he coul find me.

Again, back to the story;  this night i couldn't sleep.  I was restless, and nothing i would do could help me fall asleep.  I got out of bed, dressed in shorts, a t-shirt and a sweater tied around my waist. grabbed my backpack with my wallet and school stuff, and quietly snuck out the back door.  I made it a block away from my street, and started walking on th sidewalk.  I knew practically the whole 5 mile radius around here, and there is a gas station that is open 24/7.  I had about 200 $ saved up, because just turning 16, i got a job at the local pizza place, not far from my house.

After about a 10 minute walk, i stepped in.  I bought myself a coffee and a doughnut and sat down at one of two tables.  i planned to start writing my essay on something, i dont really remember.  After about an hour of this, i was done with my coffee, and decided to go back home.  The gas station was right next to a strip mall, so i walked through there to get onto a quicker path to home.

walking through, all the lights that were off gave an eery feel.  But to me, it was nothing.  I enjoyed the feeling of being alone, of feeling like i was the only one in the world.  I had passed through half of it when i was turning the corner, and i heard somethig.  a snap sounds out behind me, and i turn around ready to scream or run or fight when, they knock me to the ground.  I see stars and my head hurts like crazy from colliding with the pavement. he drags my to an alley behind two of th buildings.  They cover my mouth with there hand, and hold a knife to my throat.  I curse th tears of terror that start trickling down my face, for being too weak to fight.  He says to me, ""Make one move or noise and i'll slit your throat.  My backpack is laying 10 yards away, but i'd never get their in time.  I'm thinking this is how i'll die, when he binds my wrists.  he ties a cloth through my mouth, like in all those horror movies...

 ill move ahead.  I wont get into details, because i dont think youd necessarily want to hear them.  Basically, i'm tied up as he does the worst things you can think of with my body.  I was a virgin before that, and i wanted to save myself for the right guy, and this was definetly not the right guy.

once he's done with me he holds th knife to my face, cutting a line across my cheekbone, leaving a painful gash seeping blood.  Tears get mixed in with th cut, leaving agony on my face.  He grabs my backpack, grabs my wallet, takes all my money, and checks my phone number.  He seriously got my phone number.  I hated him with everything i had, and he takes my FREAKING PHONE NUMBER.

He comes back to my, throws me my backpack, comes up op my face.  I can smell his disgusting breath as he says those final words. ""You won't tell, will you? because i'll hunt you down.  I swear to god if you tell anyone i will kill you.""

I nod feebly, and he unbinds my wrists.  I get up, shaking, and pull my pants back on.  I'll never forget those moments, seared into my mind forever.

After that i dont think of anything except to go home.  I walk all the way back before i realize what happened, until i sink to my knees and sob at my front steps.  My mom comes out because sh hears me, and calls the cops.  I had to go through everything again, to tell th cops every single detail.  

After about a month, i finally settle down a fraction.  I'm in a depression, i have tons of pills, therapy sessions every other day, until i get a text message from a blocked number.

""I told you i'd FUCKING kill you""

I collapse again, and have a sever breakdown.  They bring me to a hospital until i can get over my fear, and we sell th house and move in with my aunt 18 states away from home.

I've changed my number, ive done everything, but the one thing that gets me is that he had everything so perfectley planned out.  He didn't just happen to pass by, he didn't just happen to find me...

He had planned everything.

Sorry for all th spelling mistakes, i just dont have the heart to write everything out again.  or, to read it.  I know it may annoy some people, but i hope you understand.  Thank all of you for reading my story."	t5_2t3t8	True
1345338514.0	ygaxn	Kind Neighbours and The Immigrant Manservant	antwatcher	115	15	19	"First, my apologies if I did anything wrong, I'm a reddit lurker and never posted anything before. I've also changed a few minor details to keep things vague and private, and hopefully I haven't violated the 5th rule of the subreddit by doing so.


Back in the 1980's, I used to live in this smallish city in a developing country where laws might as well be written on toilet paper, as long as you know the right people and are willing to part with bits of your wallet. The neighbouring country was having quite a bit of internal trouble then, so there were a lot of refugees and immigrant workers, some legal, some not. The one I'm talking about here is of the latter type. He was a manservant (that sort of thing was affordable to the middle class back then, and quite common) to a neighbour of mine, a kindly couple who owned a candy shop. I didn't know them well, but I used to pass by their store in the mornings and always said hello and they always smiled back; they also gave out extras when kids bought from them. Their son went to the same school as me. He was a nice boy. We never really talked, but he seemed nice enough : decent-looking, well-spoken, bookish, and never did anything really improper as far as anybody knows.


The manservant is another matter, though. We knew he's an illegal immigrant since he had no papers to speak of, and he couldn't speak a lick of English or the other official language. Mostly he understood the basic commands, 'go here', 'wash this', 'wipe this', and so forth, and he always looked at passing women with this leery, shifty-eyed glance. My mom always asked our neighbours whether they felt safe with him, and how they should get rid of him because they made us nervous. (At that time, there were frequent newspaper articles of these immigrants slitting employers' throats in their sleep and making off with their belongings. It's obviously not ALL of them and most were certainly decent folk trying to make the best of a shitty situation, but the fact that it happened before, coupled with the guy's creepiness, made us uneasy.) They always just shook their heads, smiled and said that he didn't have anywhere else to go and it would be heartless of them to turn him out, and he stayed there and kept acting as shifty as he ever did. So when my neighbours disappeared one morning and the cops appeared at our door, we naturally assumed the worst.


Naturally, that's not what happened.


Turns out that our neighbours were, in fact, alive and well. They just were taken in custody by the police for being primary suspects in the torture and murder of their manservant, whose mutilated corpse was found in the woods nearby a night before. Apparently he was also tortured before he died, and there were deep lacerations that cut straight to his bones. One of the neighbours was found with abrasions consistent with those of gotten from a struggling man trying to fight his way out of certain death; there were people who saw him buying ropes and saws the other day. We never knew if they were convicted or found innocent; my parents moved out to an overseas posting soon after that, and they were those ones who knew certain people and had a decent wallet, they could get away if they were guilty. They could've been innocent for all I know. And yes, in the intervening years, it would've been easy to find out how that turned out, but I didn't. Perhaps I may have ended up blaming an innocent man, but  I didn't want to go back there, to that candy shop, and see the couple smiling at me like nothing has ever happened.


There are no online newspapers that I can find, and our local papers, even if we kept them, were certainly not in English. I'm sorry that I can't give you proof. And they may be innocent. I'm just not sure I want to find out, given how the law works in that country. In fact, I'm kind of nervous posting this on reddit even if I've changed enough details and it's been so long and I'm a citizen of a different country. Something like that sticks with you.
 

English is not my first language. Sorry if I made mistakes.

1341865500.0	wae7y	My Mother Told Me to Be Wary of Strange Men	MsCellophane	115	17	13	"My spouse, Sarah, and I live in a fairly small town. It's not impressively secure (there are a remarkable number of citizens who were busted years back for running a child pornography ring), but I live close to the main road and never felt vulnerable in my home.

Two or three years ago, a snowy winter had set unexpectedly and suddenly on our area. Sarah and I had been caught unawares, so we were trying a few creative methods of digging our car out of the snow. Needless to say, our attempts were laughably ineffectual. And here, out of nowhere, came this guy walking down the street with a shovel. He was African-American, maybe late thirties to mid forties, and perfectly friendly. His name was Charles, and he offered to dig us out of the snow. Us, being stuck, felt we could hardly refuse--in fact, we were very grateful to have his help.

While he dug, Sarah and I stayed outside to chat with him. Again, I have to stress that he didn't ring the creeper bells in my head. He told us that he'd been walking around, trying to find people in our predicament whom he could help. He felt glad that he'd found us at the right time. When he'd finished, we thanked him with an unsolicited $5. He went off on his way and we went on ours.

About a week or two later, Sarah and I were doing our deviant lesbian thing in the living room (watching TV, I think, though my memory has honestly gotten pretty fuzzy on a lot of the details). It was afternoon, and we weren't expecting any visitors when there was a knock on the door. Puzzled, I got up to look behind the curtain on the door window. Charles was standing there, still smiley, and he gestured for me to open the door. I only opened it a little bit, my hackles suddenly up and alert.

""Hi, remember me? I'm Charles. I helped you dig out your car?""

""Yes?"" I said, not unfriendly.

""Well, I don't mean to intrude on your time, ma'am, but do you have any money? I was going to get some beer, and I just don't have anything to pay for it. It's just a little bit, I just need enough for one case. Anything you have.""

At this point, I was very ""lol no"" and politely told him that I was sorry, but we didn't have any extra money to give him. It happened to be true, but I honestly would have said the same thing no matter what. His nice-guy smile faded a bit, and he said he understood, thanks, and was on his way. Sarah and I laughed nervously, that was it, done.

Only it wasn't. Because shortly after that, I was awoken at about 2 or 3 AM by my white, shaking spouse. She told me that Charles was at the door. He'd knocked on our door, and, when no one answered, she'd seen him peeking through the curtains. I heard him still knocking repeatedly while she cried under the blankets on our bed, and I told her that I would take care of her and called 911 on my cell phone. By the time the police arrived about 5 minutes later, the knocking had ceased and Charles had disappeared.

Epilogue: Several months later, I was looking through the sex offender registry for our area out of boredom. One photo was shockingly familiar. There, on my computer screen, was Charles -- and he'd been convicted at least once for aggravated sexual assault.

1341857844.0	wa5i5	Nearly Raped 2x in One Night	aelizabeth27	131	32	60	"**This is really long, but there is a TL;DR down at the bottom if you're lazy.**

A large group of students from my graduating class in high school went to Hawaii for their ""Senior Trip"", myself included. I had a blast, drank way more than I should have, and felt pretty safe the whole time, save for one night.

One night, we're dancing and drinking at a bar (gotta love fake IDs and bartenders who don't care). Being the seventeen year old, dumb, exceedingly intoxicated girl I was at the time, I ask this ""really nice guy"" I had been talking to if he wouldn't mind WATCHING MY DRINK while I went to dance. 

Maybe 10+ minutes later, I return and begin talking to him again. He keeps eyeing my drink, and eventually asks, ""Aren't you going to finish your drink?"" 

I continue chatting, and a few minutes later, he again brings up my drink, ""Your ice is melting, you really should finish your drink."" 

Even in my drunken and naive state, I can sense something odd is going on here. ""Um, maybe in a minute.""

A few minutes go by with me still not having taken a single sip, and he nearly yells, ""ARE YOU GOING TO DRINK YOUR FUCKING DRINK OR NOT?""

I decided right then and there that it was time for a new drink. He got up and left. 


The same night, two guys had been aggressively hitting on me and my friend, one wearing a green baseball hat and plaid shorts (that will be an important detail). They started off nice enough, but after being politely declined (we were both ""good girls"" with boyfriends back home), they kept coming back and getting more and more vulgar and physical. I finally told them to get the fuck away from me or I'd have the bouncer throw them out on their asses. 

Jump forward a few hours. Everyone else I know has left except two of my friends. These friends want to go back and party with some locals at their apartment. I tell them that they're crazy and that that's how bitches get raped. They insist that they'll be fine. I let them leave (they had fun and returned safely). Only then do I realize that one of my friends had my debit card and cash in her purse, as I was wearing one of those pocketless, short, pleated skirts that were popular on teenage girls in the 2000s. 

Like an absolute idiot, I decide I'm going to walk the 12+ blocks back to the hotel, alone, at 1am, while the drunkest I'd ever been (6-7 mixed drinks in 3 hours in a 104lb body). Silly teenagers and their invincibility complexes. 

About four blocks from the club, I realize two guys are keeping pace with me about two blocks behind. After about three blocks, these guys push past me and go up to an alleyway about a block and a half away. As they walked by, I noticed one had a green baseball hat and plaid shorts on.

Road construction had been occurring in that area, and a few blocks had no street lamps on the other side of the street. As a female, it is ingrained into you that you DO NOT WALK IN THE DARK. However, something didn't seem right about the whole alley situation, so I immediately crossed the street and walked in the dark for two blocks, then practically sprinted the remaining blocks to my hotel.

A few days later, a large group of us are at lunch (kids from other cities included). And I overhear a conversation about a girl I knew from our hotel (different school) who got pulled into an alley and raped/beaten on the same night that I had walked home from the club. Apparently some people wanted snacks and played ""Nose Goes"" to see who had to be the one to get them. When she didn't come ""right back"", a few of them went looking for her.

My mouth got really dry. I asked where she was, and her friend told me it was the next big road that ran to the left of our hotel... the same road I'd been walking on. 

I got really dizzy and nauseous, and asked if she knew anything else. The girl, Kristen, had been beaten so badly several teeth were broken and both eyes were swollen shut. She had bruises and scrapes all over her body, and I believe her hand was broken. The girl who rode in the ambulance with her and sat with her at the hospital told me that Kristen remembered a green baseball hat. 

I ended up locking myself in the bathroom of my room and bawling for hours. They intended to get me, but she got attacked instead. I had horrible guilt for YEARS after this. I blamed myself for her attack- It was supposed to be me. If hadn't crossed the street, they would have gotten me and left her alone. 

I never found out if they caught the bastards that did that to her. 


**TL,DR: At 17 in Hawaii, some guy tried to slip me a roofie at a club. The same night, I walked 12+ blocks home and some guys pushed past me to wait in an alley for me to walk by. I crossed the street instead. Found out later that an acquaintance got pulled into the alley and raped/beaten by the same guys.**

1375763160.0	1jsi0y	In a parking lot at night	zzpluralzalpha	117	21	13	"Let me preface this by saying that I grew up in a *very* safe area. Play-outside-with-no-parental-supervision, sure-let's-go-exploring-in-the-woods, walk-your-dog-alone-at-2-am safe. Most people I grew up with don't have the kinds of stories that are posted on this subreddit; I have just this one. 

I had recently turned 16, and was reveling in the freedom of being a newly-licensed driver. After one of my soccer games, I made a spur-of-the-moment decision to swing by the mall on my way home, just because I could. It was early in the fall, so when I got there, it was still fairly light outside. I parked far from the entrance - still a little nervous about parking next to other cars. I can't remember what I bought. I can't remember if I bought anything at all. I may have just wandered around aimlessly for a while; teenagers are weird. Whatever the case, I know that, by the time I was walking out the door, it was well past dusk. 

I know now that I was stupidly overconfident. There were almost no cars left in the parking lot at that point; few mall-goers were enthusiastic enough to stay until 9pm on a Monday night. I began the long walk to my car by myself. Walking down the aisle, thinking about all the homework that I still had to do (*shit!*), it took me a while to notice that there was a car behind me. I probably would have noticed it sooner if the headlights had been on. Still, I thought nothing of it. I was walking rather closer to the center of the aisle than I needed to be, so I assumed that the car just didn't have enough space to get by me (in an empty parking lot . . .), and graciously moved over. 

The car didn't pass me. 

The driver continued at my walking pace of less than 3 mph, following me. Ok, maybe he's looking for a parking spot . . . except that he keeps passing empty spot after empty spot. Something clicked; I finally realized that this was creepy. I was afraid to turn around, to go back and try to find mall security, because this creepy car was directly in my way. In my mind, my best option was to continue walking as though I didn't realize anything was weird, get to my car, and get the hell out of there. 

I kept walking, but I moved my keys between my fingers and made a fist. In case I had to punch somebody? I've never punched anyone in my life. I waited as long as possible before unlocking my car, so creepy car guy wouldn't know where my destination was. I kept trying to convince myself that I was overreacting. 

Finally, I'm about 2 feet from my car. I hit ""unlock,"" and my lights flash, giving me away. Creepy car immediately zooms into the spot directly next to mine (on the passenger side of the car). I am in the car. I am closing my door as his door opens, and a hand reaches out and . . . 

I don't put my seatbelt on. I don't check that there's no one coming. I don't turn my headlights on. My key is in the ignition, and I am out of that spot so quickly, I think the rubber trail is still there. 

It's been several years since that incident. I no longer live in such a safe place. Still, after 6 years in a big city, I don't think I've ever felt quite as creeped out as I did that night. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1359095650.0	178s7j	The Man in the Elevator	MadonnaAndChild	118	17	5	"Hello, fellow Redditors! I just so happened to stumble across this subreddit by happy coincidence. I've been reading through all of these stories, and I have to say that I am absolutely horrified!... so, why not share my own tale of fright and terror?

This happened last year -- in October, so pretty much three months ago, but technically ""last year."" 

Anywho, my girlfriend and I decided to make a Wal-Mart run (she was having nuclear-like cramps and demanded that I take her to get some Ibuprofen. You *never* say no to a woman that is on her period). It was already late, and we got back at around 2 AM (left at 1 AM). We live on campus, as we're both college sophomores. I park in a parking garage that is about a 5-minute walk away from our dorm. Not very far at all. 

I parked on the 3rd floor, but the exit was on the 6th floor, so we decided to take the elevator. It was a Thursday morning, so everyone was in bed (or out drinking - 'Thirsty Thursday', waddup!), so the campus was unusually silent. 

As the elevator doors opened, there was a man standing there. I was taken aback, because he was hulking - about 6'5"", 280lbs, muscular, and had that stereotypical look of ""I'm going to fucking murder you."" I didn't move, but, again - my girlfriend could have taken down an entire army of Nazi troops with the way she was feeling. She got on right beside him. I followed. 

We rode up to the 6th floor, and the guy began to make small talk. He asked about our majors, where we lived, how we liked school, etc. He was pretty decent. All the while I forgot to press the button of where we were supposed to get off, so instead we just rode the elevator up to the 9th floor - which was in the parking garage ""office"" sector. There were nothing but offices up there. 

My girlfriend and I awkwardly laughed about it. When we got to the 9th floor, we expected the man to leave, but he just stood there. Waited for the doors to close, and said he'd follow us down and make sure we got out okay. I suddenly got creeped out, and I could tell my girlfriend was, too, because she tucked herself behind me (I'm only 6'1"", 170-ish lbs, with the arm strength of SpongeBob SquarePants).

But instead of hitting the ""6"" button, he randomly hits the ""3."" And in my state of shock, I just blankly stare at him. My girlfriend realized what he did and immediately tried to hit the ""6,"" but we had already passed the floor. So she reached out again, but the man grabbed her hand. His face had suddenly changed - he no longer smiled pleasantly or grinned courteously. The look of malice on his face will, until this day, haunt me. 

I intervened and pulled my girlfriend back. The elevator arrived on floor 3, and we both (girlfriend and I) *bolted* out of there. Luckily, we were on the same floor as my car. The man from the elevator gave chase for a few feet, but once we were in my car, he went off around a corner.

We drove to the campus security station (which was about a 1-minute drive from the garage) and told them what happened. It wasn't an hour later that they had caught the guy and arrested him. He was out on probation, but also had drugs in his system and was just pretty fucked up in general. 

Buuuut... that didn't stop my gf and I from making may a late-night trips after that. It freaked us out for a while, and we stuck with taking the stairs henceforth and forevermore. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1357736465.0	168vo0	Pedocreeper in my already sketch apartment complex	Wolfchen	137	36	16	"When I was eleven I was living in an apartment complex with my mother, who had just separated from my step-dad. On the surface, it looked like a really nice place. Clean, relatively new, quiet and tucked back from the road.

The longer we lived there, the more I realized it totally wasn't. Me and my then best friend had an awful habit of sneaking out much later than we should have and hopping the fence to go swimming. And seeing as my mom was dating her dad, we were really close and together almost all the time.

At one point, she had left for some reason while I was in the pool and she came hurrying back saying these people in a white car had offered her drugs. Um, the hell? It was creepy as fuck, and we were kind of afraid to head home. I realized I had seen this car drive through my apartment complex every night, and I had thought it was an unmarked cop on patrol, but now that I actually looked it was this beat up old Pontiac with tinted windows.

Okay so that was skeevy, but they hadn't done anything when she said 'Uh, no thanks' and decided to take the sidewalk that kept her away from the parking lots so I didn't think much of it.

But I looked out more. I found syringes on the ground on more than one occasion, and this car circled and circled every night. My friend says they chased her into the pool once(I don't believe her though, she was a chronic liar, but at the time it was scary). 

so, with all this, you'd think I would have learned to be on my guard right? ...Haha, yeah no.

I had made friends with two girls who lived in the apartment complex, they were 8 and 10 but acted like teenagers(which probably had something to do with a druggy mom and some of her abusive boyfriends. They were eventually taken into foster care.) so we balanced out pretty well and got along great. I lived in North Carolina and this was 2002, the year we had a massive ice storm, but I think this was before that. We had gotten a lot of snow that year, and still being kids, we were having a field day with it. snow ball fights and sledding and the whole shebang. 

One of the sisters I made friends with, the younger one Blair, had slept over the night before (friends were always sleeping over at my place, especially these two since their house was a two minute walk away) and we decided we would go get her sister Lizzy and play a prank on her. We got a big bowl and filled it up with snow, and she went in and told Lizzy to come over to my house and come hang out. Then we hid under the stairwell right outside their door, but where she wouldn't see from the peep hole (Why we thought she'd look, I don't know), and we planned to throw the snow on her when she came out, but unfortunately we were in plain sight of the peep hole from another apartment.

apparently, Lizzy felt like taking her sweet time, we were standing there for ages, and were talking about giving up and just going home because it was cold and I wanted to make snow cream. Then the door behind us opened and we jumped and turned around and apologized. We thought it was someone coming outside to leave for work or sit the garbage outside or something... It was some guy in his thirties or so, kinda unkempt and scruffy. The usual for the area, he was unremarkable and I don't remember what he looked like other than that.

He started talking to us, asking if we were enjoying the snow and what we wanted for Christmas. We were young, and he was nice and he laughed at our prank idea... It was a little odd, because he was so much older than us, but I had yet to get my hackles up. He told us he had this present for his nephew but he didn't know if he would like it, and since he was around our age, would we tell him if we thought he'd like it.

Definitely a little strange, but okay, we said, thinking he'd go inside and get the toy and then come out with it. But no, instead he says, ""Okay, cool! come on.""  And walks out of the breeze way in front of the building. Okay, very weird, but maybe it's a bike or a sled and it's out front. We get out there, and he says ""come on it's in this building back here""

We literally took two steps and I just suddenly thought 'wow you idiot, there's nothing back there but the hole in the fence and that creepy-ass shack. Why would he keep a toy in there. He was watching you through the peep hole, oh my god, you're going to get yourself and Blair raped and murdered, you're the older one here, do something.'

I grabbed Blair's hand and I knew she'd realized exactly what I had. We had both frozen like rabbits for what seemed like forever but must have only been a couple of seconds. I dropped the giant snow bowl and we sprinted all the way back to my building, up the stairs, inside and locked the door. We were so scared we were shaking, and Blair actually had her hands up to her mouth and was about to cry. We immediately, STUPIDLY, decided we could never tell my mother (who was Blair's second mother pretty much, since her own was almost always drugged out) because I would be in SO MUCH TROUBLE if she knew what I had almost done. I should have said something, maybe something could have been done. 

TL;DR: Creepy pedo watches eleven year old me and my eight year old friend through a peep hole and then tries to lure us to a creepy shack to do God knows what under the guise of showing us the toy he got his nephew for Christmas. Dnw. Sorry for rambling."	t5_2t3t8	True

I work second shift and live with my parents. I arrived home at around midnight and saw that the side door to the garage was ajar. I figured my dad had left it open so the stray kittens around the neighborhood had some shelter. I went inside and did what I usually do after work: play video games, surf the internet, and shower. 

I got out of the shower at about four AM and saw flashing lights outside the window. 

Because we have a firepit and asshole neighbors, we've had the cops called on us a few times because the fire was too tall (it wasn't). I went outside and there were a bunch of cops and EMTs standing around the garage door. 

I asked my mom what was going on and she said my father had come out to start his car when he noticed footprints by the garage door. He investigated inside and saw a guy laying on the cement floor, half-naked and not moving. It turned out the guy was from the local college drunk off his ass and he'd found his way into our garage, at one point knocking over a thing of oil. 

The cops drove him home, we didn't press charges because no harm was really done. 

However, when I went out during the day, I could see the footprints clearly. They led away from the garage toward my sister's bedroom window. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1342221520.0	wiwhs	Late Night Ride	shamrockshaker	118	19	7	"This happened two summers ago if I remember correctly. I was driving back home one night from my girlfriend's house, a very routine drive for me. As I'm passing a well-lit intersection I notice an older lady (prob mid 40s) at a bus stop with two kids. It is well passed midnight at this time, so I'm certain buses aren't running anymore. As I drive passed them, I start to feel really guilty that this family was, in all likelihood, going to have to walk home in an area that is not very safe. At the following intersection I decide I wasn't going to let that happen, so I make a u-turn and pull up next to the stop. 

I roll down my window and let the lady know that the buses are no longer running and that she should probably call a taxi. She tells me she has no money for a taxi and asks if I could please give her and the kids a ride home. I didn't get one of those gut feelings to say no, so I oblige. Before getting in the car, she asks if it's okay if her little boy could sit in the front seat since the back made him sick. I thought this was a little strange, but car sickness can happen so I figured it was better than having someone vomit in my car. She tells me where she lives and I head that way. 

As we're talking, the little boy begins to giggle quite a bit for no apparent reason. I figure that he's just an odd little boy. He then starts to giggle more noticeably. I look over at him in the passenger seat only to bear witness to a sinister, maniacal look in his eyes. At this point, his giggle has turned into more of a cackle. All the while, the lady is talking to me like if she doesn't even hear him. Then it all hit me. What the fuck was I thinking? My back was turned to this stranger; she could have strangled me with a plastic bag or a wire at any of the red lights we hit. There was nothing I could do at this point, except stay alert and hope that the boy would just shut up. I had never felt so helpless. He quiets down as she lets me know that we are very close. She then tells me to pull into a bank parking lot and I ask her why since all I wanted was to be in the safety of my own home. She points towards the parking lot and says, ""That's our home."" They lived in an old RV. She thanks me and they get off. As I drove away all I could feel was relief, remnants of fear, and, most of all, sadness."	t5_2t3t8	True
1340166344.0	vbae8	The face in my window.	ad7546	106	8	23	"   I grew up in a large, midwest community, raised by a single mom. We lived in a small, two bedroom house, in the middle of a neighborhood that was situated on top of a large hill that overlooked a busy road. 
  
   At the time of this story I was four or five years old and like any kid my age, I was having issues sleeping in my own bed. On a night like any other, my mom tucked me into bed, turned on my night-light, and shut my door. Her bedroom was located directly across the hallway so if I needed anything I could call her name and she would be there instantly. I woke up suddenly one night, not because I was scared or alarmed, but simply because I didn't feel the need to sleep. My bed was pushed up against the wall and my window was located at the foot of the bed. I remember looking at my ceiling and noticing how bright the moon was shining into my room. As I turned toward the wall to try to go back to sleep I noticed that someone was looking in my window. I don't think I was old enough to be freaked out by this because I don't remember feeling scared. The lady looked at me and made a motion for me to open my window. I got out from under my covers and opened the window a crack. There was an old nail sticking out of the wall that prevented the window from opening more than a few inches. 
  
   She smiled for a few seconds and then calmly asked, "" Can you help me find a house I'm looking for?""
  
  My mom had explained to me a hundred times that I wasn't supposed to talk to strangers and apparently this time I forgot all of her teachings because I was more than happy to help this lady!  The lady told me some random address that she was looking for. I could barely remember my own address, let alone comprehend where the address was that she was looking for. I told her I didn't know where that house was and she just smiled at me.
   After a few seconds of silence she said, ""Do you think you could come help me find this place?"". 
  I can remember slowly getting off of my bed while keeping eye contact with this woman, backing up to my door, and putting my hands on the door knob. The closer I got to my door, the closer she got to my window, until her face was pushed against the glass. 
  I threw my door open and ran into my moms room. She awoke suddenly and asked me what was wrong. As soon as I told her that there was a lady outside my window she started freaking out. She asked me over and over if I was sure it wasn't a dream. When she went into my room, she found my window still open but no lady to be found. Needless to say my mom made me sleep with her for months after this happened. 
  
   I think the scariest part about this is that I truely didn't understand how bad of a situation I was in. This lady could have easily taken me out of my window. Around the time this happend, a girl that lived in my neighborhood went missing. My mom never reported what happened to the police, but I always wonder if it could have been related. They still haven't found her. [Trudy Appleby](http://findmissingkids.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=566)

I thought he was a pretty cool dude.  I was around 24 years old and he was 33 years old. We'd always talk about punk music, concerts, horror movies and just shoot the shit during our late ass work shifts. After working with him for a year, I figured he was cool enough to have a beer with. So, one night we went to a bar, had some brews, talked shit about work, checked out some ladies. About a week after that, Him and I were working a morning shift. This really cute girl walks into the store and approaches me. She asked me a question about the milk and flirtatiously smiles. I just continue my job, she walks toward another isle. Few minutes later, she comes back and continues to talk. I ask her about what she does, what college she goes to, just to shoot the shit. At the time, matt is helping me put away milk and watching us. This girl tells me she works at her parent's fish market, which is in the same strip mall, and is a junior in high school. It was disappointing to hear that, because this girl looked like she was 18 years old. So, I kept my distance after that. I stayed nice, but was really not interested anymore. She picks that up and walks away. My manager approaches me and says, ""Man, I really hope you're gonna hit that. She's really cute."" I tell him that she's way too young for me. At least if she was 18, I would be friendly, but it's illegal. Matt tells me it's not a big deal that she's 16 years old. Tells me to go for it and was persisting that I sleep with her. I thought he was kidding, so I shrugged it off.  A week later, without  notice, Matt is transferred to another store. I don't see or hear from him for about 3 years. It's been about a year now that I haven't worked for Walgreens, but I keep in touch with my old coworkers. I invite some of them over for some booze and weed one night. They sit me down and tell me something. Mind you I'm stoned at this point and my friend/ex coworker John begins to ask me if I've heard from Matt in the past couple of days. I tell him I haven't spoken to him since he was transferred. He goes on to tell me that Matt had disappeared for 3 weeks, and was fired. Instead of Walgreens trying to contact his family, they just fired him for not showing up. The next day when I'm sober I decide to call his parents. They tell me Matt's going to be gone for a very long time. Suspicious of what's happening, I go on google and search his full name. Three articles come up about Matt indicating that he had been arrested for meeting a 14 year old in the park and tried to have sex with her. What was worse is the article indicated that it wasn't his first time and he'd been a registered sex offender. The other thing that got me thinking was how he got a manager position at Walgreens. Turns out it was completely political (connections, corruptions, connections).

Thinking about this always brings me back to the day where he told me it's not a big deal to sleep with underage girls. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1331658812.0	quro9	Crazy lady pacing around my property. 	soggybacon	118	15	57	"So I have that weird fear about sitting near windows because I'm afraid of being watched or that I'll see someone walk by. 

Yesterday, my dad told me he saw a lady outside so I thought maybe he meant someone stopping by for directions. He goes outside to investigate. When he comes back he just looks confused and slightly scared. Then I hear the lady outside say over and over that this is her house and she just wants to go home. She just stands there shaking the door handle  and banging on the door. The thing is our house was the first one built on this land. 

I get the cops on the phone right away. My dad tells them she was on our 2nd story backyard deck when he spotted her. She was telling him that she lived here and was shoving documents in his hand to prove it. She also claimed she was an officer when my dad threatened to call the police. 

While we're waiting for the officer to come, I suggest my dad take a picture of her face since she won't go away. You would think that she'd be terrified and leave when she sees us calling the cops and pulling out cameras. Nope. My dad absentmindedly opens the door, which is made of a large pane of glass, so he can get a picture of her and she unsuccessfully tries to shove her way through. She spends the next few minutes standing there with her hand on the doorknob or pacing up and down our driveway. 

And of course the cops don't arrive til after she gives up and leaves. We gave the officer a picture of her and a description of the vehicle she was in. She looked well dressed in my opinion, but had crazy in her eyes. She's obviously is delusional, but I hope she doesn't return. 

Has anyone dealt with something like this before? Or any recommendations on what to do if it happens again?

EDIT: She came back again! Same car, but this time I had the smarts to run upstairs to check out her car and plates. It's a little concerning that this time I saw her riding in the car with a male driver. She didn't knock on the door, but this is getting a little out of hand. Someone requested her picture and here it is [with a little blurring of her face](http://imgur.com/2G0GO). I don't want to embarrass her or her family if she's just having a harmless mental health issue.

EDIT 2: Day 3 &amp; no sign of her!. Is it all over? I hope so. Thanks everyone for all the advice/insight. I'm beginning to agree that she might be going through a manic episode and a family member is trying keep her complacent. If that's the case, the driver should know better than to trespass.

EDIT 3: No disturbances recently. I showed her photo to my neighbors, but nobody has seen her around before. We're in the process of installing security cameras and floodlights around the house. This is probably a blessing in disguise as we probably should have had these installed a long time ago."	t5_2t3t8	True
1374709129.0	1izpns	Noises in the Attic	zman2100	125	28	29	"I know that typically people share personal encounters here, but I knew after finding this subreddit that I needed to share this. This happened to my wife's aunt, Sarah. I apologize that I can't relay some of her emotions and at times have to skimp on a few details, as it is a secondhand account as told by my wife.

This was 10 or 15 years ago, and Sarah had recently been divorced. Her husband moved out and Sarah continued living in the house by herself for some time after that. The house was in a typical neighborhood and wasn't secluded or off by itself or anything like that.

As Sarah became used to living alone again, she felt like she kept hearing things in her attic and began to wonder what was making the noises she heard. She called the police and had them come sweep her attic looking for traces of anyone living up there, but they found nothing and told her she had probably just heard a raccoon or squirrel. In the days after the cops came to her house, she felt like the noises were getting louder and that there was no way it was a small animal. She called the police again a week later and the same thing happened: they didn't find anything yet again.

A few days after the second call to the police, Sarah came home from work earlier than usual. Fortunately for her, she had started dating during that time and her boyfriend was with her when she came home that day. As she got out of the car in her garage she noticed something out of place and scary as hell at the door: a pair of muddy men's boots. I'd like to think that if she'd been alone she'd have had enough sense to not enter her house at that point, but luckily her boyfriend was with her. They catiously entered the house and discovered upon opening the door a man, standing naked in the laundry room, doing his laundry. Sarah went to call the police but the phone wasn't working and she ended up going next door to use the phone. I'm fuzzy on the details here, but they managed to keep him in place in time for the police to arrive, and they took him away.

Turns out that this guy had access to her house somehow, and he had indeed been spending time in the attic. The cops found a small hole in the attic above her bedroom where he'd been watching her, and on that day he'd cut the phone line and had put a knife under her pillow. God only knows what would have happened had she come home by herself, but thankfully that didn't happen. I don't know any more details about the guy other than the fact that the cops took him away and he presumably spent some time in jail."	t5_2t3t8	True
1355611607.0	14wx6y	Twin Cities Airport	12freddiescomingforu	116	17	6	"In May, I was going on a trip to Jacksonville, Florida. We had a stop in the Twin Cities, so while we(my grandparents &amp; I,) were waiting for three hours, I decided I'd go and get a pizza and tea. Now, I'm not familiar with the Twin Cities airport, mainly because all the times I've been there, I was fairly young. Anyways, I ordered a tea from this kiosk-looking thing, and a piece of Hawaiian pizza from the place infront of it. I sat down to eat and got out my phone and decided to check my email and go on tumblr. 

About 10 minutes afterwards, some guy who looks sort of like [Shaggy from the live-action Scooby Doo movie](http://councillorpadraigmcshane.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/scooby-and-shaggy-afraid-scooby-doo-2992126-852-480.jpg) comes and sits down in the seat in front of me, just staring at me. I told him to mind his own business and he just said ""I, I just can't help it. You are so beautiful and I would love to show you around."" I told him that I was a minor, his response? ""No one has to find out, come on! I have a dog you can have!"" 

After that sentence I ran off into the nearest washroom and thought about what to do. ""Maybe he won't realize I ran into the washroom,"" I thought to myself; ""I can just go tell grandma about what happened and she'll ruin him!"" Needless to say, I thought wrong. I walked out of the washroom, only to be greeted with that nasty hippie face of his. ""Where did you go!? Come on, moms worried about you!"" I told him I didn't know what he was talking about. ""Oh don't be so silly, my darling little sister. Moms waiting for us! Come on!"" I realized what he was doing, and so I decided that the best thing to do was scream and say ""GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME!"" While he gestured for me to quiet down I stomped on his foot and ran off, told security, and they caught him.

**TL;DR: hippie guy attempted to kidnap me, screamed and security took him away**"	t5_2t3t8	True
1346843499.0	zdz4l	The Curious Incident of The Grandma Who Turned Out To be Insane, Somewhat.	justus_jonas	132	32	34	"I've promised to tell my ""when I got kidnapped by my grandma"" story, so here it is. Only it's really not so much of a kidnapping, I sort of promised the wrong things here. This happened either right before the 'cabinet incident' or right after, I can't remember so well. I don't even know why, I'm old now, so maybe that's it.

Me and my older sister were to spend the summer break with my grandma, our mum/ her current boy friend and my baby brother and sister were to spend it in Rome, Italy with the parents of our mum's bf's parents (he's the father of the twins, but not my dad). 
Everything was fine! We spend our holiday with my grandma. And at that point I loved my grandma. She was pretty much the best grandma I could imagine.
She always seemed jovial, warm and most importantly she always gave us money and copious amounts of sweets and chocolate.
During the holiday stays, she's let us play and we would never have to do the chores, she'd cook regular meals for us, but us new and nice clothes and toys.
Give us money for ice cream and the local swimming pool. From our perspective then, she was truly a saint.

For some reason my mother never saw it that way, the two hated each other to the core. Our mum would frequently say ominously that one day we would find out ""who she really is"" and left it at that. I think she didn't want to deprive us of the nice things my grandma would afford us, because she knew she really couldn't. I think by that time she may just have been wary, but my grandma was being nice, so she probably just hoped that she had changed. I'll never know.

As I have mentioned in my previous story, our mum did drugs, so did our dad, so did her bf. Our life was chaos. I didn't mind it- really, it wasn't loveless. But I had to be a grown up pretty much from the get go. Do the housework, fix my own meals. No one would make sure I'd make it to school, no one would make sure I'd be in bed on time,  I never had a routine, but I really didn't mind this as a kid. My grandma however was extremely critical of it. She often mentioned or suggested that she could take care of us, that our mum obviously couldn't and it would be ""the best thing"". We always refused, because as nice as she was, our family was just what we wanted more. Our family was warm, loving- OK, so we had ice cream for breakfast, but what kid would decide against that? But I do think this helped my grandma with the courts.

From my sisters and my perspective at that time, my grandma was the best though. We loved her, she was a different experience from the chaos of our home life. Nothing extra-ordinary happened during our summer holiday stay, only when we returned to Berlin ( It wasn't really uncommon for minors to travel alone, those days) our mum and her BF where nowhere to be found. We stood in front of locked doors ( the same doors of the previous story, I might add). 
We spend half the day waiting, thinking it might be a miss communication, but nothing. Our mum just didn't turn up. Towards the evening we began to panic a bit. We communicated with some of our friends parents and tried to get in touch with our dad. Eventually I found refuge in the squat my dad lived in, my sisters went to stay with one of her friends- we told our grandma and made more attempts to contact our mum, but those were fruitless.

My grandma then offered to take us back. Which we didn't really want, but the grown ups around us at that time made that decision for us ( that would be my dad, and my sisters friends parents), it was surely the best solution. We didn't make it home for a whole year. They couldn't have known.

After a few days at my grandma, our mum returned home to find us gone. Here are the things our grandma didn't tell us:
Our mum had let her know she would stay in Rome a few more days, because one of my sibling had taken ill. She wanted my grandma to stay with us in Berlin and my grandma had actually made her believe this is what was happening and that everything was fine.

When our mum returned home a week later and didn't find us there she called my grandma. What she heard on the phone was painful. My grandma told her that we didn't want to live with her anymore, that we decided to stay with our grandma and that was that. When she asked to talk to us my grandma simply told us we refused to talk to her. 

Now here is the thing, we never decided that, we never agreed to it.  Our grandma did the classic manipulation, she told us that our mum, (finally free of us!) decided that she ""had done enough"" and it was now ""someone else's turn"", that she didn't want us anymore and we were not to go back. 
Needless to say, we were broken. Our mum just had given us away, she didn't want or love us anymore. My grandma then told us that the best way forward would be no contact at all with our mum/ family in Berlin as it would be ""too difficult for us"".

As children we didn't know about all the things going on around it, how our mum fought for us. My grandma was a incredible manipulator, she got it through to the authorities that we were ""too fragile"" to be interviewed by the social services, she made up stories we supposedly have told about abuse/ sexual abuse in our family etc. I don't know what made her do all this, I guess she saw an opportunity and went with it. 

And this is how we came to stay with her and to see who she really was. 

Pretty much the minute she had custody of us, she was changed. 
From her point of view our mum had ""tainted us"", we were ""dirty, rotten"" and it was her job to ""make us pure/ make us good"".
At first it was mild stuff.. sitting us down to learn proper table etiquette, how to curtsey- things like that. Then it became more extreme, in trying to teach me how to ""write nice"" she once set me down 12 hrs writing the letter ""E"" again and again until she deemed it perfect. When my hand was swelling up, she just said ""use the other one"".

Every time we ""slumped"" we get hit. Pick our nose? Bam! Look bored?! Bam. 

It went from crazy, to totally crazy to the point where she pulled us out of the bed at night ( 2am, 3am), ranting saying she knows that we ""conspire against"" her, that she can tell our ""bad thoughts"" and she got ""bad thoughts"" too and if we wouldn't stop, she would be able to hurt us without touching us. Sometimes she just plain beat us up. Sometimes her punishments where weirder -like making us go shopping for small things an entire day ""one egg"", ""one apple"" ""one carrot"" until we were completely worn down.

We were in hell. Every night me and my sister hatched escape plans. But we were also stuck, our mum didn't want us!! WHERE could we escape to? This pretty much kept us in check. My grandma frequently told us that we had no where to go, reinforcing the idea. 

And then the strangest thing happened after about a year, my grandma changed her tune and allowed us to go back home. One of her relatives had died and there was nowhere she could put us up somewhere else I guess?  So I guess she hoped we were broken/ conditioned enough not to speak up? Maybe she though we enjoyed staying with her? It wouldn't come up? Maybe she was tired of us? I have no idea, that woman is crazy. I still do this day do not know the exact circumstance. I wonder if maybe, she eventually lost the custody battle and had to give us back anyway? But pretty much from one dreadful day to the next, we were on the bus back to Berlin. She attended the funeral and we were reunited with our mum - and our mum being reunited with us, we pretty much all just broke down. 

The funny thing is that actually it didn't come up at first, we were too relieved being united. I think it was month later when we realized what our grandma had done pitting us against each other.

Later through other circumstances we learned that our mum was taken away from her and spend time in an orphanage, because the courts found my grandma was a danger to our mum. The records weren't well kept, but it doesn't take much to imagine why.
Our mum doesn't remember, she always got told that she was a very ill child and had to go to the ""hospital"". 
We also found out that my grandma had once taken a 15 year old child (that wasn't hers) and our mum and traveled across the country with them until she was apprehended. I guess it's a sign of the times (late 60ies), but my grandma eventually married and just like was seen fit to mother again.

Epilogue of sorts. If you're wondering, no we didn't press charges. We just tried to break all contact with her. We moved eventually, but she hired a private detective to find us. For years she'd beg for forgiveness, so we decided to grand it eventually, being quite worn out from it all- it didn't last long. I have not been in touch or seen my grandma in over 12 years now. She has occasionally found us, and threatened us, but I live in a different country now, so I feel rather save. 

TL;DR- my grandma turned from the best grandma in the world into a living nightmare for me and my sister.

1346210613.0	z01lv	Inside the elevator with a dangerous creepy guy		115	17	6	"When I was about 13 years old, my family moved to a new apartment located on a high floor of an apartment building. I remember that was excited with the new neighborhood. There were plenty of open spaces to play soccer, baseball and just to be on the street.  I made many new friends in short time. My new friends and I formed a pack that used to wander about the neighborhood during afternoons, without adult supervision (this was long time ago, not possible for kids to do that now). The area was not much developed at the time, as my building was one of the first built. We also were one of the first to move in, so we lived in a mostly unoccupied complex for several months, with the elevators and some walls covered with dark carpet material. This made the hallways not well lit, even during the day as the lighting was artificial for the most part.

On a quiet Sunday afternoon, I was out with a few friends having a good time. However, after a little while, we just had to go back to our homes, as we had to ready up for class the next day. This time it just happened that I had to walk back alone. The street leading to my building was undeveloped for a long stretch, therefore both sidewalks where covered with tall bushes. That was the first time I realized my surroundings were a little menacing. I quickly walked by the middle of the road until I arrived to the end of the cul-de-sac where my building was located. 

The entrance was deserted. I opened the main door and entered the dark hallway to the elevators. When I get to the elevator door, I realized the elevator was in the underground floor where the parking garage was located. When it opened on my floor, there was a very strange, tall, shady-looking man, inside the elevator (I am almost sure he also had some kind of deformity on his eyes or face). 

 I had never seen this person before. I doubted, but decided to get in; mostly because I thought that he would get off the elevator at that moment. However, the man did not let himself out; and he said -- without me asking--- that he was going to the underground floor, to the parking garage. This was weird, as this guy was actually coming from the parking garage! From this moment on, I knew that  things were not right. I replied that I was going to the 12 floor instead, and I pressed the button #12 in the elevator control panel.  Almost right away this creepy guy pressed the button for the underground floor. Both buttons remained lit at the same time while the elevator doors started to close. My heart was racing fast at this point. I knew that if the elevator went back to the parking garage, things would get really bad. To this date, I am still thankful that the elevator went up! 

However, when we were on our way to my floor, this guy began talking out loud, angry to the fact that the elevator did not went down.  He even said something like I would have to go to the parking lot with him! I was very scared. When the elevator opened up at my floor, I quickly tried to get off. This was when he tried to block my exit with his body!  I was quick to react and jumped out past him out of the elevator and ran to my apartment. Thankfully, at that precise moment, I saw my dad at my home main door. The creepy guy did not come out from the elevator. I was safe.

1345065443.0	ya6wy	"""Would you like to go out on a date with me?"""	zoe715	113	16	14	"I grew up in Downtown Boston. As a young girl, I experienced countless catcalls, creepy comments from strangers, etc. That is all pretty ordinary for a big city, and they were usually just harmless (but still creepy) remarks. However, when I was 17, I began to have an out of the ordinary experience. 

It was a cold December night, and the snow was coming down hard. I decided to take the train back home from a night out with my friends, since it was snowing, it was late, and I was tired. There were a few people in the underground station, but one of them stood out. He was a tall man, probably in his 40s, wearing an army green trench coat. I’ve seen some crazy people on the train, but just looking at this guy gave me a stomachache. He had these big, empty looking eyes and he would not give up on his one-sided staring contest. 

To make matters worse, every time I looked up, he got closer and closer to where I was standing. I inched away, but eventually he approached me. He was only a few inched from my face when he said, ""Hello my name is Gregory, would you like to go out on a date with me?"" Now, he did not say this with any emotion, punctuation or semblance of sanity. His voice was completely monotone and he awaited my response with empty eyes and a deadpan face. I said “No, thanks” rather quickly and nervously, and he walked slowly away, all the while staring at me with his dead eyes until he reached the other side of the station. Crisis averted, I thought. I had thought about this unsettling incident a few more times, but then soon forgot it.

A few months later in July, I was walking down the street at night, window-shopping in a busy area of town. I was on the sidewalk a few blocks away from my house when I saw a familiar face. He was staring hard, and walking fast toward me. I panicked and ran as fast as I could in the opposite direction. I collapsed in front of a corner store and frantically looked around for him. He wasn’t anywhere in sight. I ran home. 

Two years later, when I was 19, I got a job as a barista at a local café. I had a long shift (2pm-11pm) and around lunchtime, a face I never thought I would see again entered the café and was waiting in line. However, this time he was wearing a strange leprechaun-esque green hat, which added to the creep factor. There were about 6 people in front of him, and I could feel his eyes looking at me throughout their orders. Eventually, he came up to the register, ordered a coffee and said, ""Hello my name is Gregory, would you like to go out on a date with me?"" in that same monotone voice and expressionless face. I said NO once more, and then he immediately left before his coffee was even ready. I was terrified. 

I told my coworker (male in his 20s over 6’) that this guy really scared me, and about my other encounters with him. He said that if he ever came in here again, he would scare him away, and call the cops if necessary. Later that night at closing time, I was mopping the floors. I stopped to look up, and there was Gregory. I dropped the mop, ran into the back room, and (half-crying and shaking) told my coworker. He ran outside, managed to scare him away and immediately locked the café doors. 

Now, years later, I live in Salt Lake City, and from time to time I remember my three(!) incidents with Gregory, and I shudder to think he still hangs around, looking for me to be his “date.”"	t5_2t3t8	True
1344385545.0	xuq75	Smeg for brains.	KingQuagaar	117	19	25	"First post to this subreddit, so I hope you enjoy what I have to tell.

This happened around 6 years ago. Me and my younger Sister (Claire) had just taken up tenancy of our flat off our Mom.
She had moved out after finding a new fella via the internet. Before meeting the next love of her life (who she is still with today) she had been dating several other guys, most of which were friendly, including a heavy metal fan who loved bringing his guitar over for a jam, another who loved painting Warhammer figures for me given the chance and one who had many stories to tell. Good times.

But this being dating through the internet, you will encounter the odd smeg for brains.

A couple months after our Mom had moved out, I was alone in the flat, asleep, when the phone rang and woke me up, it was about mid day. I worked 12 hour shifts at the time, days and nights, three on - three off. So understandably I wasn't too thrilled at being woke up from my slumber. I answered it and a guy on the other end asked for my Mother by name. I told him a probably a little bit of a harsh yet half awake tone that she no longer lived with us. He put the phone down without hesitation and I went back to bed without a second thought about it.

I few days later I was on my first day off so I had a chance to have a good chat with Claire. I happened to mention the phone call that woke me up, saying I thought it might have been a cold caller, trying to sell us a conservatory for out council flat. She looked puzzled and said she had answered the phone to someone the night before, saying she didn't think much of it as Mom had not long moved out and probably forgot to tell a few friends. I gave Mom a call and told her about guy asking for her over the phone. Never once had I thought about asking for his name or checking for a number but she said to get either if not both when he next calls, so Mom can call him back. She didn't know of anyone trying to get hold of her.

Several days later I was home when the phone rang again, this time it was later in the day and Claire was out with her boyfriend. It was the guy, still asking for my Mom. After telling him that she had moved out till be with her fella, he seemed to get a bit frustrated. I asked for his name and number, so I could pass it on to my Mom and he hung up. I did 1471 (number recall) and got nothing, just time and date. 

A few weeks past without him calling again but we started getting someone calling every day but not speaking. We'd usually hang up after leaving it for about minute for a reply. I would try recalling the number afterwords but didn't get it. It went on for about a week till Claire had tried and surprisingly got a number. I was hesitant at first but decided to call the number using my mobile with number blocker on. No surprise that he didn't pick up. About half an hour later though, he rang back but this time he was frustrated and I could hear him breathing. I told him to fuck off and stop calling or I'll get the police involved, especially now I have his number.

Our Mom wasn't to thrilled that someone was pestering us, that she suspects might have been a guy called Alan. Apparently they had a single date many months earlier but it didn't go very well as he wouldn't stop looking at her oddly and kept trying to grope her. Suspecting he got hold of our landline number after she called him to cancel their next date.

We didn't get any calls for a while after that, thinking the threat of police action scared him off. But he called again, this time while I was working a night shift and Claire was home alone. She answered it and he said ""I know where you are and I know you are in, so stop lying to me, bitch!"" This obviously scared the crap out of her, she hung up and called the police and her boyfriend who arrived about 10 minutes later. They couldn't find anyone watching the flat and gave a detailed account to the police, who gave us a number to call next time he rang. They took the number we had but couldn't investigate it unless they could directly link it to the recent calls we had been getting.

The next night I was home on the first of 3 rest days. After the indecent the night before I kept the landline near me. I was busy playing C&amp;C: TW when the phone rang. It was him. He was clearly angry and said ""You can call the police but they will never find me, bitch! I'll fuck you up before they find me!"" I picked up my mobile and called the local police by the number they gave. I didn't say anything to the man I assumed was Alan, but he didn't stay on the phone long after I started talking to the police. I checked all doors were locked and windows were closed and sat with Claire while waiting for the police to turn up via an unmarked car. They were fairly certain he was making idle threats, as again they couldn't find anyone near by. But after searching, they parked facing our front door thinking maybe he hid away after hearing me calling the police, thinking he would return. 

We had been sitting in almost silence for what seem like forever when we heard a car turn up, putting us on edge further. Claire's boyfriend wasn't coming round that night and it was almost 10pm. I wanted to check who it was but I ignored it and continued to comfort my Sister. About 30 minutes later my mobile rang, it was the police. They had stopped the car I had heard turn up. Apparently they occupier had got out and walked along the path alongside our flat. They walked towards our front door, stopped and used their mobile phone. They suddenly turned around and quickly walked back to their car and drove away. They stopped the car after it left our street and questioned the driver.

It was Alan. The reason he turned away and drove off was he couldn't get through to us on the phone. He thought we were calling the police again so he bolted. Me forgetting to hang the phone up properly stopped him from going 'all the way'. They found no weapons on him or in the car and they linked his phone and number we had to him. 

Me, my Sister and most importantly my Mother dodged a very fucked up bullet and thankfully we haven't had trouble of that kind since."	t5_2t3t8	True
1336141862.0	t6v96	"""THIS MAN IS AN ANGEL!"""	ZoneQ	125	25	17	"I was once a young, moderately attractive gay man.  This happened in the mid 90s over the course of a few weekends.

I lived in a small town about 50 miles away from a large town (small city) in the NW US.  I would travel to the city with a group of friends every Friday night...but I didn't have a car.  So if I wanted to hook-up or hang out with a guy I would have to forgo my ride back and try to figure out how to get home the next day.   

Being drunk and horny were conducive to neither good decision making nor a well honed ability to tell if the guy I was hanging with was normal.  Which will lead to me to post more than once here...

So this guy...

Part 1: MARK - He was tall, and pretty handsome.  Great smile.  Not really model material, but he made up for it in charm and intellect. We struck up a pretty amazing conversation.  I was fascinated by him.  The main thing was, and I shouldn't have been so impressed by this, he had had a bit part in a major 1980s motion picture staring Molly Ringwald. (That should be general enough, since every movie in the 1980s starred Molly Ringwald).  So I was impressed.

My friends approached me at the magic hour and asked me if I needed a ride home and I declined...the guy said he'd drive me and practically begged me to stay the night with him.

We went back to his place and he read me poetry and we ate chocolate and lounged on his HUGE bed. We had drunk awkward sex and fell asleep.  When we woke up the next day the weird started.  He said almost nothing to me.  I would try to talk to him and he'd grunt or say something very minimal and shut down.  He subjected me to this oddball silence for several hours of driving around running errands before he finally drove me the 50 miles to my house in silence.

I thanked him for the ride and noped out of the car as soon as he hit my driveway.

Part II: Several months later.

I was out and about again, but I'd arrived in the city early.  There was a $5 all you can drink beer bust at a smaller local bar.  This cute little Mexican boy (he was 21), Carlos, caught my eye at about 4pm and I started talking to him.  We clicked hard.  I spent the rest of the drunk evening in various stages of grope with him.  He was all over me and I loved it.

Mark showed up and started talking to me.  He seemed normal, like the first night.  I didn't really think anything of it.  We were in a group of people.  We eventually decided to take the party to some guy's house.  We all piled into 2 cars.  I sat in the back seat with Carlos and Mark sat n the front passenger seat.  We didn't get out of the parking lot before Mark called Carlos a prostitute and started yelling at him.  Carlos started yelling back...the driver stopped the car and Mark told us all to go fuck ourselves...and bailed.

We travelled the 10 miles to the house and started having all sorts of party fun.  I was pretty popular that night.  Carlos and I continued to hit it off pretty well.

About 3 hours later there is a knock on the door.  It's Mark.  He has walked all the way from the bar to the house.  He is furious and storms into the house.  He physically attacks Carlos and I step between them.  He starts to cry.  I grab him and drag him out the back door and put him up against the wall.  

""What the fuck, Mark?!"" 

""I'm sorry.  I can't help it.  I'm sorry!""  He's sobbing uncontrollably.

""What is wrong?"" I start to soften, and am really concerned.

""I thought we had something! We were perfect!"" 

""What?!"" 

""You and me.  We were perfect!  You never called!"" 

""You freaked me out.  You had my number?  Why didn't you call me?""

""I was scared."" 

I sit down next to him on the ground and he starts to calm down.  He starts to smile a bit and talk about how he was acting crazy.  Eventually, I decide he's calm enough to go back into the house, and we do.  He apologizes to everyone and even hugs Carlos.  The party resumes.

20 minutes later he attacks Carlos again and another guy forcibly grabs him to eject him from the house.

""I just want you people to know something.  You're all fucking losers!  You don't even hold a CANDLE...not even a fucking CANDLE to this guy,"" and he points at me.  ""This man is an ANGEL!  HE is a FUCKING ANGEL!  Sent by God to make you better people.  You don't even fucking know!"" 

He punches a hole in the wall and leaves. 

I didn't see him again for several years.  He was working at a store in the mall.  He didn't seem to recognize me. for which I am grateful.

**TL;DR: I had a one night stand with this guy.  He freaks me out.  I don't contact him, he doesn't contact me.  Months later he attacks the guy I'm with and starts shouting about how I am an angel sent from god.**

1371150519.0	1gaboz	Red Truck, Red Light	001525	108	10	11	"Ok I've got one. 
When I was a sophomore in college I was dating a guy who lived across town. On a particular Monday night, he and I grabbed dinner and walked back to his place to watch a movie. Sometime after midnight I realized the time and decided to drive home. He lived on a street lined with college bars and clubs so he made a point of walking me to my car; the streets are always scattered with drunk creeps. Anyway, we get to my car, say our goodbyes, and part ways. 

Once I start my car I notice the headlights of of a red truck behind me flash on (I'm parallel parked). Thinking nothing of it, I pull away from the curb and head home. About three minutes later I am waiting at a stop light and notice the same red truck speeding up behind me (he was swerving a lot but I felt a little relieved that there was no one else on the road that he could hit since it was so late). The truck then changes lanes and pulls up right beside me. I glance right to get a glimpse of this speeding, most-likely-drunk asshole. To my disgust, I see a middle-aged, *huge*, shirtless guy grinning at me...**as he slowly licked his palm**. I'm freaked out but figure this pervert just wants attention so I stare ahead at the red light as my fingers fumble to find the button to roll up my passenger seat window. Suddenly, I hear a car door open; the man, *totally naked*, is climbing out of his truck with his dick in his hand. Before I know it, he had his free hand in my window, slapping around the inside panel of my car door, trying pull up the locking mechanism. He manages to unlock the door, but as he goes for the outside handle I'm able to speed off. I have no idea if the light was green or not but I was out of there. I drove the rest of the way home with my passenger door slightly ajar as I didn't want to risk stopping anywhere. 

I called the guy I was dating once I got home and he nearly lost his mind. Super creepy stuff. "	t5_2t3t8	True

On the way I stopped at a rest area somewhere in Indiana. I peed, got something to drink and went back to my car. I was walking around a bit to stretch my legs. Two women in a rusted out Chevy Blazer pulled into the spot next to my car, nodded hello and went inside. They were white trashy looking, the ""rode hard and put away wet"" look,  a little butch but seemed nice enough. While they were inside I got my map and was checking it over when they came back out. 

They asked me if I was lost. I told them I was not lost and had just about an hour left of driving. They started asking me more questions. Where I was from, where I was going, if I was married, if I had kids. This is when the little red flags started popping up in my head. Why would they be asking me so many personal questions right off the bat? Then they asked me if I was traveling alone. I told them that I was and that I was going to see my sister in law at Evansville. They then asked me if I had a dog with me in my vehicle. That was when I said ""sayonara"". 

I got into my car when one of the women tapped on my passenger glass. I cracked it and she said that I should follow them since they were going to Evansville also. I politely told them ""no thanks"". She said ""there are bad neighborhoods around, you don't want to get lost, follow us"". I repeated ""no thanks"", rolled up my window and drove off. 

As I was entering the highway, I looked in my rear view and guess who was right behind me? The shitty blazer with the 2 creepy women. I would speed up and they would speed up. I would slow down, they would slow down. I passed cars, they passed cars. I could not get them off my ass. 

This went on for about 50 miles. I considered calling 911 to report them but told myself that I was just being paranoid. Maybe they really were going to the same area? My exit was coming up soon anyway. As I turned my blinker to merge onto my exit, the women got up beside me, flipped me off and sped away. I never saw them again. 

I think sometimes what their plan was. Were they looking for a lone woman to take to someone for sex or to kill? Were they looking for someone for themselves? Or were they just trying to be nice and I offended them? Either way, I'm glad I listened to my instinct and left. Looking back now, I should have called the police to report them. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1362798642.0	19yawh	Creepy Church Guy	Quetzalcoatly	126	24	12	"This happened when I was a kid, living in La Mesa, CA. I was 5 to 7 years old, I think. We belonged to a moderately large protestant church with a cheerful congregation, and all of the families were tight-knit, but there were plenty of non-regulars who stopped by. I have always been a very willful person, with a bit of an invincibility complex, and a feverish curiosity. As a little girl, you couldn't tell me not to go somewhere before finding that I was already there. I loved exploring and being alone and this story is about the day when I realized that wasn't always the best idea. 

It's hard to explain how stubborn I am in general, and my parents had noted this and always tried to communicate concepts of danger and fear to me, but it just didn't make a lot of sense to me. If something was scary, then you should confront it and fight it! That was my motto I guess, at 6ish years old. I had run along cliffs and swam out father than I was supposed to where rip tides were known to happen and played in the street and went looking for strangers to meet (you can imagine my poor mother) but this day was the first time in my life that I had ever really felt a pang of real danger, or a tiny thrill of concern that something very bad might be about to happen. 

When church would let out on Sundays everyone would proceed to the courtyard or the offices or the kitchens to help, and no one remained in any part of the sanctuary after some minutes. Since I was stuck waiting for my parents to leave, I liked to wander around up in the balcony where the choir would sing, and play with the organ or stained glass. Sometimes I would sneak around in the back, trying to get out on to the roof or playing where the vestments were kept. There was a behind-the-scenes area separated by doors from the elevated front of the sanctuary, and I had just been poking around in there when I decided to leave, and heard someone call to me. 

I turned around and saw this guy - maybe 20s to 30s, stringy blondish hair, clothing kinda indicative of a disorganized mind - not a homeless person, but casual and abused enough that even a younger me recognized that this guy was a little different. He greeted me warmly, as though we were good friends. I recognized that I had met him once before, in this very same room. He had introduced himself to me as people from the choir walked around us to put their things away. He had seemed a bit flustered at the time, and had mostly made small talk about things and then I left. I didn't remember his name or anything about him really, but I greeted him and was polite. There was no one else back here, the door on the other side was locked, I knew, so I wondered how he had gotten behind me without my noticing. I had gone all the way around when I first came in, didn't I? And there hadn't been anyone there. It didn't make a lot of sense. 

He asked me if everything was okay, and I said yes thanks but I had to go...and he said ""Wait a minute, don't you want to hear how I'm doing?"" and I said yes, but that my parents were waiting for me (lie). The guy proceeded to say he was fine and then ask me for a hug, already coming in for one. I said okay because it was clearly going to happen anyway, and I didn't yet want him to realize how opposed to the idea of being near him I was. Now I wished that someone was here, anyone else, but especially another adult. I started to think about how unlikely it was that anyone would ever come in here, how far away everyone was, how even though the sanctuary had good acoustics and the front wasn't all that far away, no one would hear me if I yelled. 

He hung on to me in the hug for a very, very long time. It felt like minutes were going by. Now I knew that something was definitely wrong about this. 

I said, ""Ok, well, sorry but I have to go!"" and I felt him begin to let go but then pause. Goosebumps, and not the good kind. I stepped back and he finally let go but the look in his eyes was different, as though he knew what I was thinking and feeling, that I was lying to him and that I didn't want to be there anymore. His eyes were kind of slitted as he looked down at me. He was obviously considering. I smiled, trying to be as convincing as I could, hoping to make him believe that I was having a good time and that he should keep playing his previous game. (I didn't understand the situation in full at the time, but the basics of the animalistic behavior at play made sense to me.)

After a moment of silence, I said (wishing I trusted myself to remember his name): ""Nice to see you! Hopefully I see you next week when we're not leaving. Bye!"" Smiled big, looked him directly in the eyes as I did so, and then turned around to ascend the few steps it took to get out the door and in to the sanctuary. I could feel him watching me, still considering. Trying not to run, those few seconds slowed down in my mind and were some of the slowest of my life, I think. Every instant I thought he was going to grab me and pull me back down in to the room. When I hit the sanctuary, after a few steps I skipped fast for the rest of the way, and finally hit the doors, back out in to the sound of all of the people talking, and the bright sunlight."	t5_2t3t8	True
1353997690.0	13v18k	She was looking for a partner in crime.	LilithImmaculate	115	16	45	"My friend Kari is a very quiet girl. She's extremely nice but very introverted and conserved. I went to a school with her previous to this one and we tried to get her involved in events, but she always turned us down and went home to hang out with her grandmother. Even in university, she is still expected to call home almost nightly to show that she's safe and in her dorm room.

One day Kari had gotten friendly one lecture with a girl who sat beside her. We will call this girl Danielle. Since they both lived on residence, they walked home together and decided to stop in the dining hall for a chat and some food. Everything was normal until Danielle steered the conversation into some rather....odd topics. 

First, she began by telling her how she had been in a mental health facility for trying to kill someone in high school.

She began telling my friend that when she first arrived in this city, she travelled downtown at night in hopes of finding an intoxicated homeless person that she would be able to overpower and kill.

She told my friend of different ways to disembowel cats, and offered to show her how to do it.
She told my friend of how she had wanted to kill different roommates since she had first arrived on res, but was too worried she would be caught. She also admitted that the only reason she was taking law and forensic courses was to learn to commit crime better.

Kari, already shy and timid around normal people, quickly excused herself and left. 5 minutes after their encounter ended, I got a message on FB telling me the entire situation and asking what she would do. I advised she told a professor, which is what she did. Both of us thought that the girl needed help, but we assumed that she was probably lying (or at least exaggerating) in order to get attention.

A few days later I got another message from Kari, telling me about the events that followed.

-After Kari told the professor, she was called in the next day by the police. The school took the threats and claims very seriously, but the police told her not to worry. They also thought she was exaggerating or lying, but said they were going to take her in that night for evaluation.

-Not long after, Kari was told that Danielle would not be coming back to residence. She had been admitted to a facility and was banned from the school. 

A few months later we were informed of the charges that were being laid against Danielle. Animal cruelty, animal neglect and child pornography. They had found videos of her mutilating animals. With my own research, I found pages of her online discussing how she liked necrophilia, paedophilia, etc. She proudly boasted about all her fetishes and claimed online that she had killed before. It turned out she had indeed been in care before because she had tried kill someone, and had been kept in confinement since she had been removed from the school as she was considered a danger to staff and other residents.

On res, her roommates had claimed that she was up all night and rarely left her room. They also reported a strange smell coming from it, and that she was a bit ""weird."" In her room, the police had also found a ""kit"" that she was preparing. They found written fantasies about breaking and entering, pedophelia and rape and believe that this kit was being prepared for when she would finally go and live out these fantasies. 

They also told Kari that they believed she admitted all of this to her within an hour of meeting her because she had somehow thought that she had found someone with similar interests, and was looking for a partner to help.

Last I heard, she had plead guilty but her sentencing was postponed as they are doing further psychiatric evaluations on her.

Fun times!

1340334911.0	vf1oq	My friend's father	AnarchyPanty	125	28	18	"I don't really try to remember this, but I decided to share it with you after reading ""Never Leave A Little Girl Alone With A Drunk,"" because it reminded me of my experience.

So this was when I was like around twelve, end of seventh grade or so. I went over my best friends house ALL the time. It got to the point I called her dad, Dad because I saw him so often. Hell, I had better time calling him Dad than my own father. 

Stacie and her family were close, but her parents had problems. I never saw them fight, or anything but I guess they didn't fight with guess over. So as most relationships end, they had gotten divorce. I hadn't been over for a while since that. Actually, it had been a year since I came over. When I went over, I looked a lot different, longer hair, ruby red hair since my mom said I could dye it (my mom's laid back and pretty creative so she was all for it) and a big pair of ""nerd"" glasses. I had started to ""develope"" as well. Her father was naturally happy to see me and he asked me things about school, family, why I died my hair freaking ruby red, and life in general. Eventually me and Stacie went upstairs and goofed around going onto sites and such to fool around talking to strangers. (we couldn't be seen)  

Well we had passed out around midnight and I remember getting up around 2:00 a.m. to go to the bathroom and get a drink. When I went to get a drink, I was leaning up against a counter trying to reach the cabnet (Ehhh I'm sort of....really short for my age. I'm only 4'9'' now T_T). I was just about to give up and drag a chair over when I felt two hands on my waist. I heard a grunt, and then was lifted up. I grabbed my cup and was set down. I turned around and there was Stacie's dad smiling at me.

""Why are you up?"" He asked.
""I'm thirsty."" I responded.
""You know you are pretty light."" He said.
""Doctors say I am under weight, but I should develope more."" I told him.
He nodded his head.
""I like your hair, by the way. It's really cute."" He complemented me.
""Thanks dad."" I smiled, turning around so I can fill up my cup.

I was able to fill my glass up like half way when I felt his arms go around my waist. I stopped the water real quickly and starred forward. ""W-What are you doing?"" I was able to stutter out. ""You really are beautiful."" He moaned, yea he MOANED. At this point he started to grope me and he licked my neck. I have issues with my neck, I HATE it when people go near it, breath down it, touch it and let alone freaking lick it. So this was horrible. I flinched, making myself bend over the counter a bit. ""Feisty!"" He called, as I had shoved my butt into him. 

Luckily at this point one of Stacie's brother called for Dad, saying he had a nightmare. He let me go, and I instantly ran upstairs, jumping into my blow up bed and hiding under the covers. I was so afraid he'd come up and try to go further. I remember before he let me go, though, he had ran his hand up my thigh PRETTY high. I couldn't sleep the rest of the night.

I never told Stacie considering I didn't want her to get mad at me, or accuse me of lying. She was my best friend, afterall. I didn't want to loose her friendship. I didn't tell my parents for that reason too. I was just afraid of loosing my only friend -socially awkward.- 

I had gone over her house often after that, but he never made a move again. Then again I made sure Stacie was ALWAYS with me. 

Stacie and I don't talk anymore. She was a grade higher, so after that summer we stopped talking. Now I go to a different highschool. As much as I miss her, I am a bit glad I don't visit her house anymore.

My sister and I had spent the day hanging out in Betty's room watching t.v. with her and it was approaching night time so my sister and I got ready to leave. Betty decided to head downstairs first and warm up her car and my sister followed her.

No one seemed to notice that by the time I got out of the room, Betty's uncle was sitting in the living room alone and asked me to come over to him to say hello.

1335219059.0	sovue	My encounter with a pervert	juh00lia	112	14	4	"When I was younger I lived in a community nicknamed ""the bubble"" because there was virtually no crime and we were raised very sheltered. 

The elementary school I went to was a walking school which meant all the kids lived within a mile of the school and there were no busses, we all had to walk home or get picked up. One day when I was in 5th or 6th grade my mom gets a call from one of the other parents on the phone tree warning parents that a man in a car exposed himself to a girl walking home and recommends car pools or walking home with your child after school for a while.

I go to school the next day and find out that it's one of my best friends, Ali, who he showed his penis to. She told me he called to her and said, ""hey girl!!!! look at this!!!"" and when she looked in his car he had his dick and balls in his hand.

 We are too innocent to realize this guy was seriously demented and just forget about it, it's spring time and we all want to walk home, we don't need to be picked up because we're very brave and filled with attitude, after all.

A couple of days later me and a few of my best friends walk home from school and are playing wall ball against Ali's garage. We notice a car drive by a few times and then Ali realizes its the man who exposed himself to her, and now he knows where she lives.

She runs in to tell her parents, who are Armenian and very intimidating. Her dad jumps in his car and races after the guy. Her mom calls the police while his dad has a full on car chase with this guy, driving up on the sidewalks and getting on the highway and everything. I don't exactly remember if her dad caught him or if the police did but I had memorized the license plate with a little song the last time I saw it drive by so I know they found him in the end.

My dad drove me by a house that was only two blocks away from mine a couple days later and told me that was the perverts house. He also told me that he had one of our family friends, ""knock some sense into him"", and I never heard anything about it after that ever again."	t5_2t3t8	True

So, when my sister was in reception classes (that's kindergarten for non UK redditors), she used to play with a kid called Jamie. One day she got invited round to play at his house after school. When my mum came to pick her up, she noticed that the house was really, disgustingly filthy, and that Jamie's mother seemed to be a little, well, off. My sister, according to my mum, was very quiet all the way home and said at the end of the car journey that she didn't want to play at that house any more because she didn't like Jamie and the house was nasty.

Fast forward ten years to when my sister is fifteen. My mum comes home one day looking a little shaken up. She has heard from a friend who lived next door to Jamie that he is now in a juvenile institution. He raped his little sister, who was 12 years old at the time.

We're very glad that my sister never went back to play. Just for the record, she says he didn't do anything to her but that he was always acting strangely and she was scared of him."	t5_2t3t8	True

I had the perfect ""bert voice"" as we called it and I was always the one put up to talk. One night we prank called a random number from my cool new cell phone. Normally people would laugh or get pissed and hang up half way through my script. We called a number and a man answered. I did my whole spill about how i was Anita Johnson and how i am looking for my boyfriend or some stupid stuff like that. Anyway the guy just went with it and played along until finally my throat hurt from my bert voice. I finally was just like dang i can't do the voice anymore dude we are 13 year olds and we gotta go. He insisted on talking and we ended up talking for a few minutes. I was kind of the chubby one so maybe i kept talkign to him because it was male attention. 

Anyway it turned out he lived out where i used to live and he was like a 40 year old man. He told me about how he has all this money and boats and a jet ski. Anway i ended up getting off the phone. The next day was the fourth of july and he called me to ask if i wanted to go out on his jet ski. He kept making comments about how he would go slow until i got comfortable but ""he really wanted to go fast because he wanted me to hold on to him tight."" I felt really uncomfortable and declined. 

He called or texted me every day saying he just wanted to talk or asking me to go eat or to the movies, most of the time I never answered. One day, about two weeks into him calling and texting me I was at a guy friends house and he heard my friend yelling at me to get off the phone. He flipped out and threated to come get me and take me to his house. I got REALLY freaked out so I finally I told my parents.

 My dad took my cell phone and texted him telling him that ""I"" wanted to come over and watch a movie. He got so excited. He was creepy as hell, just never sexual. My dad pulled up with a baseball bat and threated to beat the shit out of him if he ever contacted me again. I was banned from prank calling after that.

I'm not sure what happened to the guy, but I know the school sent out letters warning people about him. My brother hasn't seen him since."	t5_2t3t8	True
1366686237.0	1cwtqa	A night of dancing, and wayward hands.	TinyOokpik	128	33	22	"This tale begins with a bit of back story. I'm a fairly small girl (5'5"", under 120 lbs) and as such am usually pretty on-guard when I'm out at night. I've lived with the same roommate (Super tall and chatty gay man) for 5 years. 

Back in college we heard about an all night event at a gay club. I'm not usually one for clubs, but my roommate wanted to go, and there were water balloons and water guns. Who can say no to an all night water fight? Figuring I'd be pretty safe if I stayed with my roommate, I agreed.

The whole building was filled with giggles, dancing, loud music and general watery shenanigans. After a couple hours of playing, dancing and meeting new people, my roommate hopped up with a bunch of other people dancing on the stage. I followed and we were having a grand ole time until I looked out over a moving sea of people and saw one man standing still. *And staring straight at me.*

This man was probably 20 feet back in the crowd, but it was very noticeable and unnerving that only one member of a crowd was perfectly still. Figuring he was super far back, and probably wasn't even looking at me, so much as the stage, I shook my head and moved closer to my roommate; and by the time I looked back, he was gone. 

At this point, I assume I've imagined the whole thing, and things are fine and dandy until a few minutes later.  I'm just minding my own business and dancing terribly when suddenly I feel a hand violently shoved up my shorts on the outside of my thigh. Yelping and jumping away, I see this smug looking bastard standing right in front of the stage and staring, with his hand outstretched. Seeing the hand still outstretched pissed me off and I smacked it pretty violently before backing away from the front of the stage. I moved to the other side of my roommate and as I was telling him what had happened, when I felt the hand again. *On the inside of my leg this time.*

This time, I kick his elbow really hard, and the hand retracts much faster. My face is pretty obviously betraying my fury as I'm swearing up a storm at this creeping and persistent man.

My roommate at the point is also yelling at this guy, who slinks off towards the door. My relief is pretty obvious, and I just want to go home, but after a few minutes and with the promise of two extra eyes being vigilant, I hesitantly agree to stay. After all, I can't see this man anymore, and I'd been having such a great time outside these 5 minutes.

Not 3 minutes later, I feel a strong hand grip my knee, and I see another rising out of the corner of my eye. *No sir, I've had more than enough.* 

As retold to me later by my roommate and the bouncer that was evidently half way over to me, this is how the next few seconds unfold, between flashes of the strobe light.

**FLASH** - My face twisted in rage, my assailant groping at me. **FLASH** - Me turning towards this man,  who is retracting his hand. **FLASH** - Me in mid air, just off the stage, this creep looking up in surprise. **FLASH** - My fist, and this strange man's nose, come together in a dark dance so powerful that I feel a pop.

A few seconds later, a bouncer snags this guy, throwing him out, as my roommate calms me down. When the bouncer comes back, he says he saw the guy coming back, and he was trying  to head him off, but didn't make it in time.

When we actually went to leave, the bouncer was nice enough to scout outside for us, as well as hailing us a cab to go home - though admittedly I didn't feel safe until I was in my own bed. 

Even now I can so clearly picture a man; still in an ever-moving crowd.


**TL;DR - Keep your hand out of my goddamn pants, or I'll break your nose.**"	t5_2t3t8	True
1359968460.0	17uxxt	Almost might have been kidnapped earlier tonight...	Onox99	125	28	8	"A friend and I were doing door-to-door marketing earlier this night. It was not too late, but it had just started becoming dark. 

As we split up to go to separate houses, we noticed a car pull up behind us at the side of the road. The lights were still on, no one got out, and it just remained there. We joked for a moment. ""Imagine if it started following us,"" my friend said.

While I waited at the door of my next house, I looked back at the street. The car was slowly moving forward and then stopped again next to the house that my friend was at. I quickly finished with that house, and met up with my friend, who had just ran up to me, very paranoid. 

We continued, after deciding to stay close together just in case. As we made our way to the next house, the car started to slowly move again and stopped when we got to the next driveway. 

At this point, we were both extremely paranoid. No one had gotten out of the car. It was clearly following us. We both stood there in the driveway, while my friend called our manager to tell him that we might be being followed. We stood there for a few minutes, and in that time, the car did not move. The car's lights were on. No one got out. 

After a few minutes, the car finally started moving again. It went down a few houses, but then turned around. It drove past us, stopped, and its lights turned off. 

We decided to keep moving, to see if it would follow us again. As we got further down the street, I kept looking back, and the car was still in the same place. We also noticed that the cars wheels were slightly pointing left, as if it were ready to turn around at any moment. 

Once at the end of the street, we had an idea. We turned left and walked down another street for about a minute. Then we walked back to the street with the car to see if it was still there. It was, and a man was standing outside of it. It was difficult to know for sure in the darkness, but it seemed like the man may have been looking in our direction. 

We panicked and quickly went back down the other street. Our manager called and told us that he sent someone else to come meet up with us. 

Before going to meet him, we both had a foolish thought. Even though we were extremely scared, there was also slight curiosity. We wanted to know if the man and the car were still there. So, once more, we went back to check. The car was gone. We felt both relief and panic, as that meant the car could be anywhere. Then, we realized something. The car was not actually gone. It had turned around and was now parked on the other side of the street, facing toward us. 
 
With that, we were done. We ran down the other street, met up with the other worker, and went inside the nearest store.

1359261138.0	17cr50	I probably should have moved sooner	six727	118	18	18	"I had three creepy incidents happen over a few years at my old apartment that, in retrospect, really make me wonder why I didn't move sooner.  Unfortunately, my neighbor for a brief period of time before I actually did leave probably wishes she had, too.


The first incident happened a few years ago.  I got home from work one night around 8.  It was a particularly cold night in February and it was extremely dark out.  At the time, I often forgot to leave any outdoor lights on when I left in the morning, even if I knew I wouldn't be getting home until after dark.  I lived in one of the rear apartments of a duplex and, like every night, I pulled into the carport in the back to park.  The house was on a corner lot.  To enter my apartment, I used a side door that was around the corner of the house.  


I grabbed my laptop bag, slung my purse across my chest and crossed the back yard, turning the corner into the little side yard between the duplex and my neighbors house.  Just before I reached my door, I heard a noise behind me.  I had my keys in my hand.  I had pepper spray on the key chain.  But I froze.  I had just enough time for my stupid brain to think, ""Please be a cat. Please be a cat. Whatever that is, it's moving too fast and too loudly to be a cat."" before I got slammed from behind.  My glasses were knocked off and I fell face first to the ground.  My laptop bag got ripped off my shoulder and whoever knocked me down tried to pull my purse off me, too. Because I had worn it across my chest and then fallen on it, he couldn't yank it off despite his repeated efforts.  As he ran away, I looked up and, squinting, saw his figure for a moment as he ran under a street light.  I screamed after him in this unreal voice I've never heard before from me and hope to never hear again.  


The police came to take my statement and helped me find my glasses.  I was actually sore for a day or two from tensing up so much in just those few seconds when I heard him running up behind me.  They never caught him and never recovered my laptop.  


I made sure that I left all three VERY bright security lights on any time I left my house.  My neighbors laughed at me for having the place so bright but I NEVER came back to a dark yard the rest of the time I lived there.  Knowing what I know now, this was a smart move.

A few months after that, there was a period of time where my dog would get agitated in the evening when we'd be hanging out watching TV.  She'd let out a low, menacing growl.  She is a very chill dog and generally only barked or growled when someone was approaching or something was legitimately wrong.  Because I lived on the corner, people would occasionally cut through the yard and I assumed that was what was likely what was happening.  One night, just as she started growling, I quickly muted the TV and heard rustling in the yard.  I was terrified, but I didn't want to overreact and call the police for no reason.  I waited a good while and after hearing nothing, I put her on a leash (she's a pretty fierce looking pit) and stepped outside.  There were footprints in the mud under the window that looked into my living room.  I had those bamboo slatted blinds so I couldn't see out, but I realized that you could see in perfectly at night when the lights were on.  I'm certain someone had been watching me and it had probably been going on for some time.  At this point, I was starting to think seriously about moving but some part of me didn't want to be driven out of what was actually a great neighborhood and I didn't want to overreact.  Things happen, right?  I bought some of that film for my windows so it was impossible to see in, installed a security system, put up the security system signs and continued to be cautious.


The last incident happened some time later.  I woke up at 3 in the morning to my dog barking furiously.  Again, this was a very rare occurrence so, after a few heart-pounding second gathering my wits, I jumped out of bed and ran to the windows in my room (upstairs) that easily looked down into my back and side yard.  I saw nothing.  After a few minutes of watching, I turned on the lights in my room and waited for a bit, continuing to watch.  When I was sure that no one was hanging around, I went downstairs to double check that things were ok and they were.  The next morning, however, I took my dog outside and noticed that someone had broken the cover of the telephone box on the side of the house where the phone lines enter the house.  Someone had definitely been in my yard and they were obviously trying to damage the phone lines.  I filed a police report and decided I didn't want to be afraid anymore.  I broke my lease and moved out not long after that.


The last incident at this place did not happen to me, but to a girl who moved into the other apartment just a few weeks before I moved out.  Maybe 3 weeks after I left, I read a news story online that a woman in my old neighborhood had been attacked.  My stomach dropped and I had a feeling it was going to be at my old place.  I found some video of the news story that showed a puddle of blood on the front porch where I used to get my mail every day.  Apparently she had gotten home from work late one night and a man came out of the bushes on the side of the house (the side where my door was) and attempted to mug her.  She resisted and was shot, grazed in the neck by a bullet.  She attempted to get away and ran towards the back yard and the man followed her, shooting her in the knee.  


I'm sure that once I left, the security lights I always made certain were on didn't stay on.  And while I'm definitely not sure that it was the same person in all of the incidents I described above, I'm fairly certain that the man who mugged me was also the man who attacked her and that he waited for her in the same place he waited for me.


I'm so glad that I moved and that I left the lights on."	t5_2t3t8	True
1356722290.0	15l3b4	Gut instincts are your friend. Sort of. 	yudkev	124	29	9	"Age: 22. Deserted (at the time) college town. 

I feel the need to get this story out because it may not be the content that bothers me so much to this day but the inexplicability of it. This happened over the summer and I'm currently alone in the same house seeing as my roommates, like the majority of the students here, are still home for break. 

I had just returned from studying abroad and was initially excited to have a house to myself. The first few days involved some porch beer and redecoration, but then it got weird. My house, which is one of two houses on its block, overlooks a motel on the other side of the intersection along with some other old houses. As I was sitting on my porch around 1 or 2 in the morning I first notice the same car circling my block and repeatedly passing my house, as well as a middle-aged man on a bike. I assume 2 AM biking of this sort is drug related and my county is known for its property crime, poverty, and drugs. This results in a whole lot of break ins to student housing during the holidays, which is what my initial paranoia was about. 

I ended up calling the non-emergency line and reporting the car that I had now seen every few minutes for the past hour. The officer who extended his patrol stopped at my fence and informed me that tonight must be one of those nights that the motel was being used for crack sales. Apparently drug dealers are known to check out entire hallways at a time and there's not a lot anybody can do about it. This explained the ridiculous traffic in and out of the motel and perhaps the surveillance car, which I sincerely hoped did not mark me as a snitch. I stayed on my porch and two very obviously drugged out guys parked diagonal from my house to smoke and talk a million miles an hour. They were the only car on the street now and they creeped me out just enough to finally make me go back inside and try to sleep. 

This whole week was marked with a lot of sketchy dealings that I observed from my porch.  I think whatever tendency of mine is responsible for that is the same one behind my interest in this subreddit. It's pretty masochistic given my horrific phobia of home invasions. 

All of that is the context for the next night. Despite my weeklong bout of mild paranoia, on this night I finally felt at ease. It's unlikely anyone would try to rob my house as I was very clearly home. As I was getting ready for bed around 3 AM, in a great mood, I found myself thinking about how nice rain would be. Though it hadn't rained and wasn't supposed to rain again for weeks, I randomly peel back the blinds of my bedroom window that overlook the street, porch, and our crappy tiny wooden gate. 

The second I do that I see a man opening said gate and stepping into my yard. He wasn't staggering like he was drunk, nor did he look homeless. He was clean-shaven, had on a nicely fitting zip-up jacket, jeans, and a navy baseball cap. He looked completely calm and purposeful, hands in his pockets like he lived there and had just stepped out to his car for a second. He wasn't glancing around or hesitating, just making his way towards the porch stairs. He didn't have any bags on him so if he was intending to burglarize, he'd be limited to whatever would fit in his pockets. 

I don't really remember what I was thinking beyond the immediate ""seriously? now?"" but instead of hiding under my bed with an Ikea knife and my stungun as I always assumed I'd do in this situation I bolted out of my room in my pajamas (possibly just an oversized t-shirt) and swung open the front door and yelled ""fuck off."" 

It was probably the surprise of someone having noticed him rather than my menacing 5'2 stature and fighting words, but he immediately turned around and headed up the street and of sight behind the hedges. He didn't jump; I didn't *scare* him. It was the kind of defeat a hunter would have after the millionth bird got startled and flew away. 

So much of this remains very unsettling to me, and I wonder if I'd be alone here. In this same house I've dealt with homeless people banging on our door every night offering to wash our cars or just asking for money. I've watched drug-related fights break out. But this guy didn't seem related to anything like that. He could've been a professor and if he were slightly younger and fitter, a frat guy. If I hadn't *for no fucking reason whatsoever* looked outside I wouldn't have seen him, and I hate that I'm so curious about what he would've done next. Wrong house? Possibly. But I feel like if I had just scared the shit out of a tiny girl I would've apologized or at least been surprised that I wasn't at the right house. He looked like he knew he wasn't supposed to be there and how calmly he gave up suggests it wouldn't be too inconvenient to try again. I wonder if he lives in one of the other two houses on the hill that, despite the college neighborhood, seem to house a bunch of middle-aged men who never leave the porch. 

I've always hated that girls are taught to be suspicious and on the defense if they're alone. It's not right (for either gender) to have to account for the possibility of every stranger on the sidewalk being a rapist or worse. But for some reason this incident awakened every irrational paranoia of mine like that. It doesn't help living in a place like this with so many unsolved stranger assaults, including the person who's gotten away with posing as a taxi driver for the past few years and dropping his victims off on the side of some country road afterwards. That person could look completely normal, someone that *wouldn't* even evoke any heebie-jeebies. If my instincts were correct and that guy wasn't coming over with good intentions it infuriates me that he felt entitled to carry them out in complete disregard of *my* right to feel safe in my house. Obviously that's a gross simplification of every such instance ever, but this event marked the point that my feeling of safety vanished, and nothing even had to happen. Yet now pretty much every sound outside my window is that gate opening. Some of these stories here definitely embody my worst nightmares and I'm hoping I won't ever have to post a similar follow-up.

1353468305.0	13jphf	People call me Hoss	XCorneliusX	121	27	19	"My age at the time: 18  Gender: Male, dressed in black pants, white undershirt, black long sleeve shirt and black shoes. 


Passenger age 20  Gender: Female, dressed in a light colored shirt with jeans.


It was late in the 20th century and life was good. Me driving an original paint job and interior 1970 Camaro SS tipped the scales for driving fun. I was a happy guy. Sure I have had an unusual life if you have read any of my stories, but this was a straight forward request of me to bring my passenger to Las Vegas to meet her family.  She was a friend of a friend so I didn't worry about her and my car was seeming in good shape for the trip.

It was July of the year and very hot in Southern California the day we took off for Vegas.  Cuing the stereo, we headed out. 

All was going well in our drive as the temperature soared to very hot from hot and we made our way along Interstate 15 North.  If you have driven this road, you know it is extreme, but at that time there was not much along the road. As we progressed to the very long incline where a truck lane to the right exists, the shimmer of mirage came off the road. 

I didn't overexert the car but soon noted a warning light on my dash cluster.  I smelled something sweet and burnt.  Transmission fluid!  Not really so flammable, but needed to keep moving.  

I let my passenger know what was going on and said we needed to find a place to pull over.  On this incline that was a non option, so I set the emergency flashers and slowed to a slow pace about 40 to 45 mph.  

As we came to the top of the incline, an exit to the right named Summit something or other was there.  We exited and headed to what appeared to be a small truck stop and it featured a prominent tall sign proclaiming 'EAT'. 

The thing is, it was nearly deserted.  Only one old man sat on a bench out front and otherwise the place was looking long closed and dry.  I told my passenger to stay in the car while took a look at the car.  She lit a cigarette and I stepped out. 

It did not take long to find that the pan gasket for the transmission was leaking badly.  I popped the front hood and measured the dipstick.  No liquid showing.  Not good.  What I did not have with me was fluid and a gasket.

I spoke with the man and asked about a parts shop.  I had tools with me in the trunk.  He was long on slow talking but seemed a decent enough guy just hanging out in a closed desert diner/gas station.  He said the nearest place for parts I needed was Las Vegas. 

I was distressed and this was before cell phones were common to everyone.   Corona didn't even have the row of dealerships along the highway then.  I went and spoke with my passenger.  There was no working payphone and no means to get any help.  The old man was the odd thing here as he got there somehow, but had no car.

In a few minutes a Dodge Ram Pick-em-up truck appeared.  It was white with a rear cap that flared up in the back and gold flamed stripes on the sides.  The man drove up and parked.  He got out of his truck and stood about 5'10 and was maybe 60 with a head of white hair, white cowboy hat and an amiable gut.  A mature white guy who carried himself like any redneck would.  In short, in my life perspective of that time I saw no threat there. 

The man walked over to the old man and they talked for a bit and the old man gestured at us in a friendly way.  The man seemed jovial and walked over toward us. He introduced himself as Mike, but everyone calls him Hoss. I introduced myself and my passenger.  He did nothing that seemed creepy at all.  We might well have been at a social gathering with mixed ages.

Well, Hoss said he his friend over there mentioned we needed to get to Vegas.  It so happened he was heading to Vegas.  Oh how lucky for us!  We discussed that I needed to get my passenger to her family and I needed to get to a parts store, but if he could just get us to the city, we would be grateful. He asked if we had any money.  I told him I had about 40 dollars for gas and was going to get money there and had to get more due to parts. I offered to pay him 60 dollars for his trouble. He laughed and said that was more than enough and we three piled into his truck.  

All went well on the drive to Vegas and we had small talk. When we reached the city, Hoss offered to go ahead and take my passenger to her parents as they were going to pay me for my trouble and that would pay parts, a bus to my car and Hoss' time and trouble.  We all were agreeable.  What luck!  

We arrived to drop off my passenger and I stepped in with her for a brief bit and her parents paid me 300 dollars.  A lot more than I expected and that was more than I made in a weeks pay.

So when I went back to Hoss' truck he gestured friendly-like that I jump in.  I did.  He asked how it went and I told him they paid me a lot more than I ever expected. He seemed to brush that off and suggested we get a beverage before getting to the parts store.  

It was a 7-11 and I offered to get him a soda.  He thanked me and I hopped out and got us each a Super Big Gulp, a monster size cup that seemed to hold a two liter in each cup.  I paid and brought the drinks out. Getting in the truck, I passed Hoss his and sat in the passenger seat. 

Hoss said he knew where the parts store was and would take me there, to which I agreed happily.  I thanked him repeatedly for being such a great help. He just chortled and made small talk. 

In a short while he turned off a main road and started down a dirt road with nothing but a very distant something. I asked why we were on the dirt road. He said ""Short Cut"".

At first this made some sense but the road turned slightly away from the distant buildings. We were in the middle of desert.  I was feeling uneasy but stayed firm as Hoss asked me just how much I was paid. 

I was holding my drink and took a sip and replied, ""more than I get in a paycheck.""  

Hoss slammed the brakes and reached his burly arm really fast around my neck and shouted, ""Gimme your money or I kill you!""  Instinct and perception took over and I tossed the near full iced Super Big Gulp on his face and front. His grip loosened substantially and my right had went for the door handle.  The door opened and I hurdled out.  

I had gotten the element of surprise and won my freedom.   Hoss yelled out profanities at me and I yelled my suggestion of his body being better buried here by me.  With that he stepped on his accelerator and tore away from me.  I was okay and he was driving madly away, but here I was in the desert at least a couple miles from anything on a summer mid day in clothes better suited to evening in cool weather.

I chose a direction that seemed to be closest to me and started walking.  I have no idea how long it took but by the time I was nearing my goal it shone as a new set of homes. I was sweating horribly and ready to just drop. I was mad.  I mean, real mad about what just happened. 

As I got closer to the nearest home I saw a man standing there who was dark haired and lean.  He was just watching me walk out of the desert in black.  I walked toward him and as I got into earshot, I called out for water please. The man was holding a shovel and obviously wary of me. I neared and he asked who I was and why was I there.

I gave the tl;dr and asked again for water.  His garage was open and he grabbed a cup and ran some water into it from the spigot for the hose. He reached it to me and I greedily took it and guzzled. 

As I was in shade, and the man was talking me down I told him the whole story and how I ended up there.  A sudden thought occurred to me and I was worried for the passenger woman.  The homeowner was more at ease with me now though understandably unwilling to invite me inside. He had an extension for his phone in his garage and allowed me to call the womans family.

I explained what Hoss had done and asked them a favor of picking me up.  They agreed, and I gave the address for where I was.  They took my caution to be on a lookout.

Some time later they arrived and picked me up.  I thanked the man for his kindness as many could not survive unprepared in the desert.  I was lucky to be close enough to someone.  He said not everyone is a bad person.

I was taken to a parts store, bought what I needed and to a Greyhound terminal in Las Vegas.  I thanked them and bought a ticket.  

A while later the bus arrived and I got aboard.  I asked the driver to stop in Barstow.  Sitting back I reflected on what had happened and suddenly realized I was alone and that psycho knew where my disabled car was in an abandoned place.  It was not a safe place to be, but I had to get there. 

Barstow was close enough to where I was going but not close enough to walk.  I later found out I could have asked to get off at that exit since it was a real exit off the highway.  Live and learn.

So, I walked to a diner that was popular with big trucks and sat down.  I ordered a soda and a sandwich.  I was hungry.  A man was seated next to me and asked me what my story was as I looked out of place the way I was dressed.  I explained what happened and the man introduced himself.  

He was a war vet with non working legs. He had special crutches by him.  He said he could take me to where my car was as it was on his way.  He was driving a 5th wheel truck hauling cars.  I must have looked him oddly as he laughed and said, ""Don't worry, I ain'ta going anywhere fast with these legs.""  I laughed kindly with him and agreed.  He added,""whoever this Hoss guy is, you are probably better off with someone keeping watch when you fix your car.""  I know my eyes lit up with that as it was a huge concern to me and I thanked the man.

In a short while we headed out and true to his honor he waited as I replaced my gasket, torqued the bolts, and added fluid. I then tested with it running.  Not the cleanest way to do this work but it was done.

The old man at the store was gone. The sun was waning in the sky and my car was fixed.  I thanked him again and he told me, as a soldier he kept his word and to this day he remains the same.  I felt he was honest and had a slight restoration of faith in humanity.  

We both headed out at the same time and I made my way home.

Gender: Male

Setting: Australia 

Back in early high school, I would often walk home with two other friends. The walk was a lot shorter if you cut across a large soccer field that was largely surrounded by bush and a few houses. However, one side of the field dipped down into a bushy, creek area. One day we decided to play hide-and-seek in the creek area. I decided to be the first to seek and my friends scattered. I closed my eyes and started counting ""1...2...3...4"", when a much louder, deeper voice joined in, ""6...7...8...9. I can see you"". I knew this voice wasn't my friends and knew it was someone bad. I opened my eyes and looked up towards the field, I could vaguely make out a figure through the bushes - it was definitely a man and he was looking down at us. At this stage I didn't know where my friends were but assumed they had heard him to. 

Now, I knew we had to get out of the creek, but it essentially only had two exits and he could easily see which way we were coming up and cut us off. He was now yelling at us, telling us he is going to get us and we're trapped. I decided I had no choice and I'd make a break for the exit that is closest to a main road. I grab my bag and start running. My friends must have seen me and start running in the same direction, although I am back of the group as they were hiding closer to the exit. He sees us running and heads to cut us off. We get out of the creek via a small bush path that enters onto a small carpark before hitting the main road. As soon as I hit the carpark I feel a tug on the back of my bag. Hes got me. As I hit the ground an elderly looking lady, who must have just walked around the corner from the main road, yells at him to get off me and he immediately runs away, back across the field. 

The lady made sure we were okay and asked us if we wanted her to escort us home. We all decided we were fine and headed home. I didn't tell my parents or the police. We just left it. Looking back, it could have simply been someone messing with us, but it was creepy. "	t5_2t3t8	True

Back in 2009 my family and I took a vacation with some distant relatives to Ireland. There, in a small town west of Cork, my English relatives had a cottage or two which is where we stayed. I was around 13 at the time and quite innocent. Born and raised in Canada, I always tried to see the best in people. I unknowingly befriended strangers without questioning for one second if they were safe or not. 

I was the youngest person in the cottages with my family and bored out of my mind. I wanted to make friends with some Irish kids and being an innocent 13 year old, I thought they would be as friendly as me. One day, while my cousin was hanging some laundry, I saw a boy who looked around my age playing with a soccer ball and a field hockey stick in the field behind the cottages' backyard. I yelled to him, asking him what he was doing and if I could join him. He said I could play with him and so I quickly found my way to the field. May I note that I've been playing soccer since I was 4 and was quite good at it. 
We talked a little, and all I can remember is that he was 10, wore a green shirt and had an awful black eye. I tried my best not to look at it, and kept my concerns to myself. 
I don't even remember his name. 

While we played, he started getting very violent and would really try and hurt me, acting like I was a weak Canadian girl who didn't really know how to play. I tried pushing back but he was so much stronger than me, I really didn't have a chance. This is where my memory gets blurry, I just remember that we stopped playing soccer and he was holding down my limbs, trying to prove he was stronger than me. I told him that he was and that he had won. He wouldn't stop. I tried running away from him but he kept on catching me and taunting me about how weak I was. I was scared, this guy wasn't letting me go. Next thing I knew I was on the ground, and he pinned me down. He was right on top of me, his face inches away from mine. I tried to stretch my neck away from him, hoping that he wouldn't try to kiss me or something. 

All this time, he was acting like it was nothing more than a game. I really thought he was going to hurt me, and to this day have never been more terrified in my entire life. I finally mustered up enough strength to push him off me, told him that my cousin wanted me to go back home and ran as fast as I could. 

I never saw him again during the trip, but I was very shaken up about it.
I never told anyone, and when I came back home a week or two later, I promised myself to never let anyone do that to me ever again. I had nightmares about it and every time I hear an accent that sounded like his, I get a little freaked out.

 I think I was just an innocent bystander in a bigger problem and maybe he needed to prove his strength to someone after getting a black eye. I will never truly know the truth, but I'm really not that interested in finding out."	t5_2t3t8	True
1339944237.0	v6g5c	My crazy ex-husband(Long story)	jlmoyer17	116	18	53	"So, this is one of my favorite subreddits and I'm always thinking to myself ""damn, I never have crazy experiences with weird people to share..."" until my boyfriend reminded me that, oh yea...I do. About 8 years worth of weird shit from my crazy ex-husband, plus I've managed to remember several other occurrences thanks to reading on here all the time. Soooo anyways, I thought I'd share one of the scariest things that ever happened to me. Sorry it's so long. :/

Some backstory: I met my ex-husband 9 years ago when I was 16 and he was 19. We had gone to the same high school together, but never talked due to being in different grades and social circles. I ended up bumping into him one day at his parents coffee shop and we chatted for awhile, with him mostly hitting on me the whole time.(The first words out of his mouth instead of any kind of ""Hi, how you been?"" or anything like that, were ""Hey jlmoyer17, you got hot since I seen you in school."") I end up going with him back to his parents house and sleeping with him the next night(I was young and stupid and 16, OK?) and thinking the whole thing is probably just a one night stand anyways. 


The next morning I wake up, feeling awkward about last night and even more so when I bump into his parents on my way to the bathroom. So, I'm getting ready to leave when he wakes up and professes that he ""loves"" me, has always loved me and used to wish he could ask me out when we were in school, used to ""follow"" me around when we were in school(knew who my friends were, what I liked, etc.) and asked if I would go out with him, then started weeping that if I didn't go out with him he would be devastated and so on. So, I said yes.(I chalk this up to the fact that I had just had a horrible break up with my previous abusive boyfriend 4 months prior and was still pretty emotionally damaged. So, at the time I thought this was sexy and sweet instead of creepy.)
We end up dating. 3 weeks later he asks me to marry him one night after we'd finished a romp in his bed. Not really what I envisioned a proposal to be like, but I say ""Yea. Maybe someday."" without really considering the situation. In his mind, we are engaged, I'm his fiance', I should move in with him(I'm still in high school btw and he still lives with his parents) and so on. I also find out from his sister that he HAD been ""stalking"" me when he was in school. He had all these notebooks he'd written in about me, he had clothes that he wrote my name all over in sharpie and safety pins. I'm kinda weirded out by his behavior at this point but don't think anything of it and brush it off, choosing instead to think of it as ""cute"".


Fast forward a few years:
I get badgered into moving into his bedroom with him at his parents house after I graduate high school, despite my parents protest that I should get my own place. His behavior has also changed and gotten weirder. He tells me what I should wear and frequently buys me slutty clothes, then proceeds to ""show me off"" while we're in public together, but gets pissed if other guys look at me or he thinks I'm looking at other guys. He will at times accuse me of ""looking loose"" or ""like a whore"" because of how I dress. At one point he tells me that he's a ""real live vampire"" and has the urge to drink blood, but instead smokes all the time to stave off the ""urge"". He tells me he used to have 2 inch long canines, but that someone broke them when they hit him in the face with a baseball bat. On several occasions he makes me sit still while he cuts my arms and licks my blood. He constantly gets into fights with his parents, screaming and throwing things at each other. His parents also constantly get into fights and scream and throw things at each other. Mostly they fight about their ""swinger parties"" that they have once a week.


His parents end up getting divorced and his mom keeps the house we are living in. I'm now subjected to walking in on her with random dudes every day when I come home from work. She had no sense of bedroom privacy and would screw her random encounters on the couch, kitchen table, kitchen, bathroom, etc. Fun times. I'm trying to convince my ex-husband that we need to move out and get our own place. We've been living with his mom for 3 years and I think enough is enough. He constantly makes excuses, saying we don't have the money usually. His mother also doesn't want us to move out, but instead thinks that we should get married and live in the basement of her house. ""It would be like your own apartment!"" she says. Eventually, we do get our own place, but only after I have done all the work of finding and securing it and borrowing money from my parents for the security deposit. I'm unhappy in my relationship at this point in my life and I convince myself that if we can get away from his mother, things will get better. 


Things do get better after we move out, but only for a few months, then I'm back to being unhappy again. For the past 6 years, he has continued to pressure me about getting married. I wanted to wait, because in the back of my mind I wasn't sure about marriage, but he asks and asks and finally I give in and we end up going to the district court and getting married. Not really the ideal wedding I had envisioned, but I let him talk me into it. His behavior hasn't improved at all over the past few years, with him still acting like he's 19 and immature. He can't hold down a job for very long and I'm the one paying to support us both. He frequently spends money on stupid things that we don't need such as guns for himself ""to practice shoot"" and toys for himself(remote control helicopters, magic tricks, stereo equipment, fancy lighters, kites). No, I'm not joking.


We end up buying a house together and moving an hour away from my family and friends, but closer to his sister.(who is the only normal one in the whole family.) He has a full time job at this point but complains that I never ""let him do anything he wants"" or that I ""constantly ignore him"". He continues to spend money on things we don't need after we buy the house, such as a $20,000 Jeep, a motorcycle, more guns, etc. He constantly harasses me for sex every single day, multiple times, usually making me feel bad if I tell him I'm not in the mood. Often times, I'd wake up in the middle of the night to him on top of me whether I wanted to or not. He'd just pin me down until he was done and then ask, ""was that good for you, baby?""  Finally, I reach the point where I'm wishing every single day that he would just leave me and most nights I cry myself to sleep. I realize that he is never going to be the one to leave because he has been obsessed with me since he knew of me in school.
Last year, I finally get up the nerve to tell him I'm not happy and I want a divorce. 8 years after we've been together. This is when shit hits the crazy fan. 


The day I end up telling him, we have an argument before work and I leave for work, telling him ""we'll talk later"". Instead of waiting, he follows me to work and screams at me to talk to him while I'm sitting in the parking lot. I try to tell him I don't want to talk right now and he ends up pushing me into a fight, at the end of which I end up screaming at him, ""I want a divorce!"" He reels back, shocked and yells at me some more. We end the ""discussion"" with him screaming in my face, ""well, I hope the next guy treats you like shit, you fuckin bitch!"" and he storms off. The downside to it all, is that we work in the same store together, so the day doesn't get any better for me. When we get home, he's calmer but keeps saying things like, ""I want you to go get counseling"" and ""you just need time to think"". He doesn't think I'm serious and thinks I have ""mental instabilities"" He then proceeds to call his family AND MY FAMILY and tell everyone that I'm a crazy, alcoholic, pill-popping bitch who needs serious help! Mind you, I drank occasionally like a normal 24 year old, but hadn't for over a year since the medication I was on was not to be mixed with alcohol. The medication itself was for the condition I was diagnosed with, [PCOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCOS). Nothing that would affect my ""mental stability"". 
We spend the next 2 weeks with me sleeping downstairs and him upstairs in the bedroom. I avoid him as much as possible because he still maintains that I ""need serious help"". I frequently wake up in the night during these 2 weeks to find him standing over me, sometimes whispering to himself. I usually freak and yell at him to go the fuck back to bed. He continues to get up and come downstairs in the night, almost every night. I start sleeping with a knife under my pillow. I know I should have left, but I didn't want to leave my dog and 3 cats with him alone and I was afraid he'd hurt them if I left. Then the night comes that changes everything. 


It's about 11pm and I'm sitting in my kitchen, surfing the internet and texting a friend of mine who happens to live down the street from me. He knows about what's been happening and has been checking in on me from time to time. My ex comes downstairs and wants to know what I'm doing on the internet. I tell him none of his business. He tells me that Brian(the friend I was texting) had blocked him on Facebook and that I shouldn't talk to him and block him on Facebook as well because he's ""trying to ruin our relationship"". I tell him that's ridiculous, and I'm allowed to be friends with whoever I want on Facebook. He gets furious and starts screaming at me and tells me to get out. I say, ""fine, I'm going to my parents"" and pack a quick bag with some work clothes in it and text my friend that I've had an argument with Mike(my ex) and am leaving my house. He tells me to text him in 20 minutes to let him know that I'm OK. As I'm in the bathroom getting my toothbrush and things, he decides he doesn't want me to go and starts yelling at me that I can't leave.


He traps me in the bathroom and I yell at him to move. He refuses. I put my hand on his chest and push, telling him to move again. I break past him finally, and he's still yelling at me not to leave. I yell something to the extent of ""fuck off!"" at him and he snaps. He grabs a hold of my bag and starts screaming at me ""You think I don't love you?! I""ll show you how much I love you!!"". I'm yelling at him to let go, and he yanks me forward, causing me to trip and drags me through my house to the stairs that lead to the 2nd floor bedrooms. I regain my footing but he yanks me forward again and I smash my head into the side of the wrought iron railing. He takes this opportunity to get behind me and starts pushing me up the stairs while now screaming, ""I'm gonna show you how much I love you, you bitch! When I'm done loving you, you won't want to leave me!!"" I'm now terrified that he's going to rape me if he gets me upstairs and my survival instinct kicks in. I get my feet planted on the step almost level with my head and push back as hard as I can, successfully knocking him backwards into the wall and onto the landing behind him.


I slip out of his grip and grab my bag and turn to run out the door when I realize, my purse. My purse has my car keys in it and it's on the table in the livingroom. I turn to go grab it, but he sees it the same time that I do and runs, grabbing my keys out of it before I can. He runs back upstairs still screaming, ""I'm gonna show you how much I love you! You aren't leaving me, you bitch!"" I'm panicked by now and digging for my phone when he comes back downstairs with one of his handguns and points it at me. Seeing that, I completely freak, scream at him that HE'S the crazy asshole and bolt out of the house, deciding that I'll walk to my friends house and maybe he can give me a lift. He follows me outside and throws my keys at me and runs back inside. I grab them, jump in my car and drive down to my friends house. I pull into his driveway to see him getting into his car. He was going to drive up to see if I was OK, because he'd had a bad feeling when he didn't hear from me. I break down, crying and shaking. He sits me down and asks me if I want to call the cops. I say no.(I know, I know, I wish I would have now). He then asks me if I want HIM to go up and ""take care of him"".(To clarify more, my ex is a tall, scrawny, goth-type guy and my friend was a big, built, punk-rocker type guy who had a green belt in Karate). I also told him no, that I just wanted to get some sleep. It was 2am by this point. So, I stayed with him and his friends in their spare room for 2 days. 

My ex decides he's leaving the house and goes to stay with his mom, at which point I go back to the house. While he says he's giving me space, I find out that he's now constantly harassing my family, calling every day and weeping to my mother and saying nasty things about me to my brother. My brother actually goes to confront him one day and ends up having my ex's crazy mother come after him with a frying pan, screaming that she was going to kill him and my whole family. My father finally put an end to all that with a phone call to their house. I heard later that he told Mike and his mother that if they didn't knock off the BS, there would be a day where they would have an ""accident"" on their way home from work and that no one would ever find the bodies.(My dad worked for the government for 35 years and can be scary when he wants to be).

 Things quiet down for awhile and Mike leaves me alone. I go through the process of filing for divorce papers and Brian(my friend) is my main support group since I don't know anyone else out where I live. He routinely checks up on me, sometimes bringing a movie to watch to help take my mind off of things. One evening, Brian and I are hanging out, talking in my kitchen, when my ex shows up without warning. I jump up and ask what he's doing here. He doesn't say anything to me, instead pushes me out of the way and starts screaming at Brian how he's a bastard and this is all his fault and he shouldn't be in ""his"" house. Brian calmly stands up and says he's allowed to be there since I've invited him and that my ex needs to calm down. Mike starts screaming that he needs to ""GTFO or he's calling the cops"" and reporting Brian. My ex grabs my phone off the kitchen counter to call the police and I jump and try to grab it away from him. He grabs and twists my arm, then throws my into the fridge. This sets Brian off(his dad abused his mom when she was alive and he can't stand men who treat women like that) and he grabs my ex, lifts him off the ground and slams him into the wall, screaming at him that if he ever touches me like that again, he'll beat the ever-loving hell out of him. My ex tries to yell at me to call the cops(again I should have and reported my ex) but I didn't want Brian to go to jail or get in trouble.

Eventually, my ex leaves and I break down again, asking Brian if he'll stay the night on my couch, because I'm afraid my ex will come back. He does, and amps up his visits since my ex still has keys to the house. I don't hear anything from him(my ex) for a few more weeks, but have this strange feeling every once and awhile when I'm home alone. I start noticing little things out of place when I come home from work(my ex had quit his job at the store where I worked so I didn't see him there every day). One day, my fears were confirmed when I came home and found the alphabet magnets on my fridge had been rearranged to say ""Balls to U. I C you."" which scared the crap out of me. I then noticed that his handguns were gone as well. He had left the case open and on my bed for me to see. My ex had been watching my house and coming in when I was gone! I eventually got his sister to get his set of keys from him, but I was still scared that he would show up again. Things calmed down though and the weeks went by and I finally got the papers signed(his sister helped me with that as well) and he shacked up with some 42 year old woman(his mom is 46 btw). After the papers were finalized he pretty well left me alone, except to text me now and again to see if I wanted to ""hook up for old times sake"" to which I always respond, ""go tell your 42 year old gf to give you a bj and leave me alone"". It's been a year now since the divorce and all that nastiness happened, but I'm happy I went through with it and didn't let him talk me into staying in that horrible relationship with him. Looking back, I now see how creepy and crazy he and his mother were.
I'm sorry this was so long to read, I just thought it would be a good fit with the creepy/crazy people stories I see on here. Thanks for reading!

**TL;DR Had an 8 year relationship and married a guy who tried to rape and kill me when I finally filed for divorce.**

1339417183.0	uw1ff	Dry hump	SenoraNintendo	116	23	27	"When I was 16 I was expelled from school for being a ""threat to the faculty and students."" I am far from a threat. I'm 5'2, and 105 pounds with absolutely no upper body strength.
During my time of expulsion, I was mostly at my friends townhouse getting drunk and drowning in my own self pity from a break up. 

We stayed up until about four in the morning one time, just drinking and talking and having a good time. She informed me that he had invited Ozzy over. I knew Ozzy through the drug world because my ex that I was crying over was a pothead. Ozzy was cool though, so I had no problem with him coming over. 

We continued to drink and talk when he got there though he was also taking benadryl, wrapping them in toilet paper and downing them with beer. Interesting I thought, I'm not into drugs so all of the shit he would do was pretty interesting to me. It was about 6:30 when my friend and I decided we wanted to go to bed. Ozzy was welcome to stay the night but he said he didn't want to, and that he'd just finish his almost gone bottle of whiskey and he'd head out. 

I fell asleep on the couch, and I don't know how long after I was woken up, but I was woken up to something on me. Then I felt it, I was being humped! I was so scared and creeped out, I didn't know what to do. I tried to roll over, trying to pretend that I was sleeping and trying to find a comfortable position in my sleep. When I rolled over on my back, Ozzy pinned me down.

""Ozzy, what the fuck are you doing?!"" I said rather loud.

""Shhh..."" was all he said.

""No! Get the fuck off me!"" I said louder than before, hoping Heather would hear me from upstairs. 

He kept dry humping me as I was struggling to get him off me until he gave a hard hump and moaned. I pushed him off me, grabbed as much of my shit as I could and I ran out of there crying and feeling dirty. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1338698289.0	ui773	Everybody loves Raymond...except for me- this is why.	upside_down_frown	118	22	27	"I've only had a few creepy experiences occur in my lifetime (so far)...this sticks out in my mind as one of the creepiest.

I was 19 and completely naive and -I thought- untouchable. I live in a small to medium sized town, it's always been quite safe. We've had our share of oddities here and in nearby towns (Wisconsin loves to produce weirdos), but I always felt comfortable being out and about by myself after dark. 

One night, I was on a mission to find some good vinyl for my then boyfriend's birthday. I hit the local antique mall first because I wanted to do some browsing for myself also. Upon arriving at the large warehouse space housing the mall, I realized they closed at 6 pm and it was 5:45. I quickly walked through the booths that I knew sold records, and, not finding anything, I decided to head out. 

As I reached the door, a man called out. 

""Hey!""

Confused, I turned and looked. He was probably in his mid to late thirties, around 6 feet tall with dark hair and a red windbreaker. I remember thinking he looked a lot like Ray Romano. I have a pretty active imagination, as well as an uncannily accurate memory, which is why I remember this almost 12 years later.

I smiled tentatively. ""Yes?""

""I like your jacket."" 

I looked down. I was wearing my favorite jacket, a vintage wool toggle coat. 

Confused, I responded. ""Thanks.""

""Did you see the jacket they had just like yours here? Come on, I'll show you, it's just like yours!""

I had actually noticed a similar coat during my quick visit, and remembered that it was in the back corner of the mall.

I continued smiling politely. ""Yes, I did! Thanks for letting me know.""

I turned to continue out the door when he spoke again- a note of urgency creeping into his voice.

""No, really, you should come back here and check it out. It's exactly the same as your jacket!""

To this day, I find it weird that he chose this tactic to approach me. A jacket is an odd thing to comment on. And why would I believe a stranger truly cares about me seeing a coat similar to one I already owned?

He continued to try to convince me to accompany him to the back of the store, and I finally dropped the polite act, reminded him the store was closing, and walked away.

Feeling creeped out, I got into my car- I drove a cute little white Chevy Tracker convertible back then- and drove downtown to grab a bite to eat. I also wanted to check out the little hole-in-the-wall record shop on one of the side streets near downtown. As I started driving, I watched in my rearview to make sure he wasn't following me, and when it seemed he wasn't, the incident faded from my mind. After running in to quickly eat at the local cafe, I got back to the task at hand- finding a great gift.

As I was browsing through the stacks of records, I made small talk with the shop owner. He was scruffy and a little rough around the edges, but he was friendly and seemed excited to see a person under the age of 50 interested in buying records. As we were chatting, I spotted it: a rare Beatles album. It was in my price range and I brought it to the counter. The owner and I continued making small talk while he rang up my purchase, when the bell rang to announce a new customer entering the shop. We both looked up and my smile faltered.

It was him. The Ray Romano lookalike from the antique store.

He acted surprised and said, ""Small world, isn't it?"" 

He smiled. 

""Yeah"" I replied half-heartedly, completing my purchase. I couldn't get out of there fast enough and looked over my shoulder the entire time I walked down the dark side street back to the brightly lit sidewalk where I had parked my car.

All the way home, I tried to reason it out in my mind. I had been hyper aware on the drive downtown and hadn't noticed anyone following. Yet what would be the chances that this man- a man who'd tried to get me to follow him to the back of a warehouse in the process of closing- would show up at this tiny, obscure shop that few people frequented (in fact, it finally folded a few years later)?

Nothing ever came of those encounters, but I was far more conscientious and aware of my surroundings from that point on. 
And I just realized that this might account for my intense dislike for Ray Romano."	t5_2t3t8	True
1338240612.0	u99z9	Outside my window	pushthingsforward	115	18	23	"I grew up on a small farm in Innisfil, Ontario. This farm was about a 15 minute drive to any sort of village or town. The house my family lived in was actually a very historic building. It had been built in the late 1800's and was built of large stones.The first floor had massive ceilings, which also made the windows huge,roughly 7 feet high. Because it was an old house the layout was kind of weird. All of the rooms were easily connected meaning no hallways. When my step brother moved out I was able to take his room on the first floor. I was the only one down there at night, my other brother and parents had rooms on the second floor. Most nights were creepy to say the least... my father was an antique collector so everything in the house was even more terrifying at night. Sleeping in that room as a young teenager really made me tense some nights. Animals were able to get into the walls and scratch around, sometimes a car would drive up the super long driveway and just sit there with the lights on (I am guessing it was robbers checking the place out, seeing if anyone was there, or other teens thinking of something to do) Birds would hit the windows some nights and scare the living crap out of me, coyotes howling close to the window...the list of scary things can go on but there is one summer night I will never forget. Some may know in Ontario on a hot/humid summer night it is very difficult to sleep without air movement. So I have the my bedroom window wide open. It had a mesh screen to keep the insects out but I had my shutters wide open as well. If you have ever been up reading with a light on you will notice that a bright light from inside a room means pitch black darkness outside. So there I am reading a book with my light on and window open. I hear some rustling outside but always hear that every night from animals. Living in the country one does not suspect a random person to be out and about...so the clear thought was animals as always. Not this time. As I lay on my bed, there is a sudden scraggly woman's voice. I don't mean scraggly soar throat I mean 10 000 cigs and a bottle of whiskey scraggly. All she said was ""Hey, you"". I wish there is a way to better explain the terror that shot threw my mind. Not only was there someone outside my window looking at me in my boxers, but I could not see her face it was so dark. I must have jumped threw the 9 circles of hell because I have never felt that fear before or ever again. There was absolutely no way I was going to answer her so I shot out of my room, turning the corner to run up to my parents room. My mom was already running down the stairs. She is a light sleeper and heard the lady, my step dad following behind her. They bolted outside while I ran up to my brothers room. My mom said they never found anyone around and they would have seen a car driving away (because it was such a long driveway) I then slept with that window closed until we moved out. I even closed the shutters so nothing could see in and used a fan to move some air. I know it was just a lady's voice but knowing someone was there looking in at me for I don't know how long was a terrifying experience. Especially as there was no reason for someone to be wandering through the country late at night. There are a couple other scary happenings at that farm but this was by far the most terrifying.

1335916249.0	t2d2x	Zucchini Flower	Realannmariew	120	20	15	"This event happened a few years ago to my friend Sarah when she moved into her first place in Melbourne. Rental prices in Australia are crazy to say the least so Sarah took to a site called GumTree which is an Australian version of Craigs List. After looking through a few properties Sarah finally found a nice townhouse owned by a middle aged woman who lived there alone. The townhouse was beautiful, well-maintained, close to everything and very cheap. The only downside to the property and probably the reason why the rent was so cheap was because it backed onto a tram line.

Sarah moved into the property two days later and began enjoying her new home. As she worked long hours she didn’t see much of her housemate apart from the occasional times when they’d both decide to watch some late-night TV together. Everything seemed to be going fine until Tuesday night came around. Sarah was upstairs reading when she heard a blood-curdling scream from outside, “Oh god someone help me, my baby is on the tracks! He’s been hit, someone help me!” She threw down her book and looked out her window towards the tram tracks but saw nothing, no baby, no screaming woman and no tram. She waited in her room and concluded that if someone had indeed been hit she would have seen a tram and there would be a lot of sirens by now. 

Sarah didn’t get a chance to ask her housemate about the screaming woman she heard that Tuesday night until a few days later. When she finally did ask her housemate about the screaming woman she explained that there was an old woman who lived across the road who was a little crazy and would sometimes start screaming out random things. Later that day as Sarah was sitting outside her housemate came up to her, grabbing her firmly by the arm and pointing to an elderly woman standing across the road “That’s her, she’s the one.” Now this lady fit the crazy old woman look to a tee. She had wild grey hair which fell just below her shoulders, hunched over and waddling slowly to her front door dressed in moth-balled rags. 

Two weeks past and each Tuesday night Sarah heard the old ladies cries about someone being on the tracks. Sarah, content that the old woman was just a little off centre and no threat to her, ignored this as she loved the townhouse and knew she’d never find anything this cheap again. The following Tuesday night though as she sat in her room finishing up some work she heard the scream “He’s on the tracks. Someone help, he’s on the tracks! Quick, quick, he’s been hit!” rather than continue to ignore this she decided to see if she could catch a glimpse of the old lady screaming. She ran down the stairs and to the front of the house, peering out the window across the road to see the decrepit old woman wailing. She looked out the window towards the old woman’s house and saw her too standing at her front window looking out from behind the curtains not screaming but looking to for where these cries were coming from. Confused Sarah stepped back from the window and listened to the screams, it was then she realised that they were actually quit loud. As she followed the sound of the screams she came to the backdoor of her house, opening the door she found her housemate standing in the backyard screaming, zucchini flower in hand, eyes glazed over looking as though she was in a trance. Sarah froze staring at her crazed housemate who seemed oblivious to her presence even looking directly at Sarah but not really seeing her. The housemate continued to wail while Sarah looked on in shock. Finally Sarah snapped out of her frozen state and ran back to her room, locked her door and pushed a cabinet against it and waited. She stayed awake all night terrified her crazed housemate would come to the door but she never did. At first light Sarah grabbed as many of her belongings as she could carry and ran. She never went back to the house but did send some movers over to collect the rest of her things making sure not to book them for a Tuesday.

1376225660.0	1k53y3	Come out and play	itsimplied	126	30	13	"I was reminded of this when reading another story on this page, its a short one but enough to scare the life out of me.

When I was 14 we went on a school camp in a National Park with an organisation called Outward Bound who operated camps in the area, it was 3 days of hiking and camping, sleeping in tents and cooking outdoors, it was all very fun for the most part.


Our guide was a guy called Anthony who was very funny, played a lot of pranks on us, we really liked him but he could sometimes be a little over-enthusiastic sometimes. Anyway on the last night, we sat around the campfire and he told a whole lot of ghosts stories, so as a bunch of young kids we were really spooked, but then we finished up with everyone telling jokes so we all went to bed pretty relaxed.


So we were lying in our tent that night, my friend James and I had just finished chatting and were settling in to sleep when we heard movement outside. Initially we didn't think much of it, it was slow movement, a few steps then a pause... a few steps and a pause... I whispered to James, he'd hear it too but maybe it was just one of the our friends taking a pee.


After a while it got closer, and James and I were freaking out, it sounded like someone was just outside the tent, and then the tapping started. Just a gentle intermittent tapping on the outside of the tent, by this stage we were scared but we'd resolved it was just Anthony trying to freak us out, so we ignored it for a while, until the whispering started.


There was a creepy voice, just saying ""come out and play... come out and play"" over and over. It sounded so eerie, at this stage i'd had enough of this prank, as I was genuinely freaked out and yelled ""fuck off Anthony its not funny!""


The tapping stopped and the footsteps moved away, we wrote it off as just another Anthony prank. Anyway we didn't get much sleep that night because we were really wired after that weird encounter, so in the morning we were pretty grumpy.


We walked out of the tent, and there was Anthony eating breakfast in typical high spirits and a dumb grin on his face (he was one of those annoying morning people), he asked us how we'd slept or something and I was pretty stroppy so snapped off a response something along the lines of ""yeah would've slept fine had it not been for your dumb antics, that wasn't funny man""...


Anthony looked puzzled, and after much discussion this was basically what came out of it: It wasn't Anthony, in fact it wasn't anyone on our trip. He sat us down and had a very serious conversation, he said obviously no one would get in any trouble, but if no one owned up he needed to contact his supervisor. He got on the walkie talkie, we hiked to the nearest road and got picked up (it was the last day anyway). They called the police, we submitted a report but I didn't hear any more of it. From what i could gather from their reaction to the whole thing, it wasn't the first report of such an occurrence, but they didn't want to let a lot on, probably so as not to scare a whole bunch of teenagers. But that was almost 10 years ago, I haven't heard anything of it since.


As a result, i've refused to go camping ever again."	t5_2t3t8	True
1370364809.0	1fnt18	Follow up to yesterday's post	schmoo757	121	26	55	"hey there everyone. Yesterday I posted a thread about a creep from when I was 13. 

http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1flvkp/just_discovered_this_subreddit_thought_i_would/

Well now I have a follow up. 

I think the man I talked about in that thread has been following me for a long time. Just yesterday, I accepted a job offer out of state. I've been unemployed for a few months and this job was a great offer easily over 15 hours away and a few states over from where I currently reside. This morning I woke up, went outside to grab something out of my car, and tacked onto the windshield wipers was a folded up piece of paper. I grabbed it, walked back to my apartment, and on the paper was written the words, 

""No more bars to keep you safe,
No more cops in sight,
You can't leave me in this place,
You can't go without a fight,
I have no more time to waste,
I have to make a move tonight.""

with a single smiley face written at the bottom. I'll post a picture of the note in an edit when I get back on my laptop. 

I'm officially freaked the fuck out. 

The worst part is no more than an hour ago I received a call on my cell phone. The number was blocked, I answered, it was the same voice I remember from when I was 13. All he said was, ""long time no see, isn't that right Mark (my name changed for obvious reasons)""

My cousin and I are currently on our way to the police station to file a report and we're going to stay in a hotel for a few nights and try to get a patrol car to stop by. After that I'll be staying with my cousin probably until I move out of state. 

I'll make sure to keep updating.

EDIT: Ok here are two pictures of the note found on my car. [Picture 1](http://i.imgur.com/fMFv6j5.jpg) and [Picture 2](http://i.imgur.com/vbaTp7W.jpg)

I'm currently with my cousin. He hasn't called my cell phone since this morning but we're on the lookout for anything suspicious. 

EDIT 2: I always keep a knife with me at all times. I also keep a large assault knife and a taser in my car. Just checked my car, taser and knife are gone, I don't know how long they've been missing. Right now, I'm just staying as safe as possible. Will update if anything else comes up.

EDIT 3: The response to this has been pretty crazy. I'm going to get off reddit for the rest of the day. I'm honestly hoping this guy decides to try something so we can catch him. I will update the next chance I get. Be safe everyone! "	t5_2t3t8	True
1369864174.0	1fanur	Don't open the door	Preception	116	22	4	"I lived in a suburban, Northwestern area, and had a pretty fine life. I was about 8 years old, and was getting ready for school one day. 

My Grandfather would usually come by in the morning just to say hi, or come in for a cup of coffee. Since not many people knock so early we could pretty much just open the door and let him in without checking who was there. 

Well, one day, there is a knock at the door, a very loud knock. This was abnormal since my Grandpa never would knock so loud like that. We open the door, and this stranger busts into our home. He was at least 6' 3'', and looked strong. He started screaming at us about how they were coming, and how we can't call the police. 

Not knowing what to do, my parents tell me to bring my little brother upstairs, and to lock the doors. My mom calls the cops as my dad walks over to the man who is now screaming. My dad tries to calm him down, but the man ends up pulling out a knife and hit my dad. He misses, drops the knife, and ends up running outside of our backdoor, across the street, straight into another home.

This guy had apparently stabbed to death his mother not ten minutes before this happened.

1367861797.0	1dsy3w	a creepy brothel encounter...this is long.	mz_nadia	111	15	24	"Ok so I am a sex worker, hooker, whatever. I work in a legal brothel in Australia. I am fairly hush-hush about my work but my family know what I do. I am Italian Aussie.

So one day this dude shows up to my work. He asks for ""Nadia, the blonde"". That's me. I have seen him somewhere before but not sure where. He is fairly tall and slim and looks a bit arabic. I usually get the sri lankan boys cos I am a bit chubby and blonde so I am surprised. He speaks very softly and looks a bit nervous. I assume I have said hi to him at work before but he has never booked me. So he books me for two hours. Idk if you know much about hookers in brothels but a two hour booking a very long time to book on the first visit. Usually first time clients stay half or an hour. but okay.

First he wants to talk. He wants to talk about me and so I give him my cover story which is I am from interstate and studying and not seeing anyone. He gets a bit stand-offish but I figure he may just be tired. We fuck and chat and whatnot til the buzzer goes. I ask if he would like to shower first, or me. He says no he wants to extend. Ok fine. I start to feel a bit uneasy but go with it...get back into it and he starts telling me about how he knows where I used to work. I thought he meant another brothel but no he means my 'vanilla' job. He starts saying weird shit so I call him out on it and he admits he has found my real (non-hooker) twitter account, looked through everything and realised who I was and has been reading it for weeks just trying to find out where I lived so he could come visit. I have never put my 'full' name on twitter so I figure I am okay. But he tells me if I lie again he will know because he has been reading my twitter. He accuses me of not being Italian because I can't speak the language. I explain to him that my grandparents assimilated and that not even my dad really speaks it anymore so none of us kids learned it. He goes on a bit of a tangent about how I look Serbian and smirks. My mum is half Serbian but I chalk it up to a good guess.  My twitter has about 1600 followers and I can't tell who he might be to ban him yet, and during sex I am racking my brains trying to figure out if I tweeted my ethnicity there or not.

Next day another hooker friend rings me freaking out cos a dude added her on facebook and messaged her looking for me. He had the same name as my best friend. I look at the profile and it's not my best friend, but this creep. Apparently he has been messaging all the hookers at my brothel asking for me and asking for my roster and my number as my best friend (who he has obviously found on twitter).  I tell her to ignore it.

Later that week he books me for an hour. He wants to extend again so I go and get the eftpos machine and bring it to the room. I swipe it but it stuffs up and I have to swipe it again. He says ""It's ok, I trust you [real firstname lastname]"". My name is really unique and this is no mistake. It's not like he said Jane Smith and guessed right. I sort of freeze and tell him not to do it again. He calls me my real name throughout the booking and I tell him to stop and that I won't see him again.

Two days after this happens, my dad rings me. He says he got a fb message from some dude with my best friends name telling him his daughter was a whore and did he know? And tells my dad where I am working and a description of me down to my tattoos. He replied ""yes I do know but fuck off"", because my dad is not a prick and loves me anyway. I call my boss and tell her what happened and not to accept any bookings for me until I meet them in person because in the past this client has used different names. She agrees.

Next thing, I get an email and so does my dad. He's CCed in my brother too, telling me what a whore I am, how much I fuck for cash, why my partner is stupid for staying with me, blah blah blah. This creep doesn't think my family knows cos I told him my family are strict Italian Catholics. And it's got two photos of me attached- one of me in one of the rooms at work which I didn't take and one from my twitter with my sister. 

I take the weekend off work and go away for a couple of days, about 3hrs drive away to my best friends parents house. He tweets where we are (not @ my name, but just says he's ""at home"") and I get another email saying the guy is driving around the town, looking at the sights, wants to come over and meet my friends dogs, like it's perfectly fucking normal to want to hang out with a hooker you are stalking. I was so scared I spent the night in bed with my best friend cos I didn't want to sleep alone. I called my cousin to go over to my house back home and make sure my windows were deadbolted and all my house was locked up and that the cat was okay. 

About two weeks ago I was talking to another friend of mine and turns out he followed her on twitter and was asking her about me but she blocked him because she found him creepy. I don't know how many other people he has added cos I don't know his username/s. He deleted the one he spoke to my friend on and it was some garbled crap anyway. He seems to have disappeared in the past week, but I can't be really too sure and I have to be careful with work- now I get my boyfriend to drive me to work and he picks me up when I finish and drops me home. I deadbolt myself in the house as soon as he leaves, until daylight. 

He has used lots of names: Adam, Adem, Harry, Jeff/Geff/Geoff. 

And there you have it, my first reddit post. I hope it is okay. Unfortunately in my job I get some super creeps. Sorry it's so long."	t5_2t3t8	True
1365271524.0	1bt1eq	The Church Camp Nightmare	YourSkyline	120	22	40	"At the age of ten, I went to this church camp that is called Cherry Run. I didn't bring any friends with me, nor did I make any. It was a rather miserable and lonely week for me.

In the middle of the week on a Wednesday, I was sitting outside of the tabernacle alone. We just finished evening service and I had about two hours to spare before curfew. I just sat there reading a book in the dim light, feeling lonely but trying not to care.

It was about a half-hour later when a young adult male approached me. He told me I looked so sad and asked if I wanted to get a snack from the snackbar near the dorms. I was thrilled, to say in the least, that someone was paying attention to me. I agreed and never asked his name. He was very tall, with a little chub to him. He had greasy brown hair and these icy blue eyes that I will never forget.

But anyway, I ended up getting a candy bar and a bit of jerky from the snackbar and he paid. We sat on a bench and chatted for a bit and I was content. I had an odd vibe about him, but I decided to pay it no attention because he was so friendly. He took me to play ping pong for a bit, which I was dreadful at.

It was a little before curfew then when he said we should go on a walk. I didn't mind and I agreed, trailing beside him as he strayed from the gravel path that circles the middle of the camp. Eventually we ended up behind the girl's dorm, in an unlit section of camp. I thought nothing of it until he asked me for a hug. Complying, I allowed him to wrap his arms around me and I was stiff but tried not to mind. He was so friendly to me, after all.

Well, let's just say his hands strayed from my back and ended up in an unsuitable place. Then they dipped past my clothing and you can guess what happened from there.

I was traumatized. He made me promise to keep it a secret because ""imagine how sad the other campers would be if they found out how you (referring to me) sinned."" Devastated, I agreed. I felt so sick to my stomach that I couldn't sleep that night. In fact, at lights out I was so scared that he would return for me in the dark that I hid out in the dorm bathrooms until morning.

The next day, I avoided all meals and hid in various places at the camp. I didn't want to see him, and every time that I did he would give me this unsettling smile. I'll never forget it. I started getting really bad pains in my stomach and sides and would hide out in the nurse's room for hours on end.

I kept his promise and never told a soul. Now I live with this terrible secret that I feel immense guilt of. It haunts me everyday, in dreams and flashbacks. It has been eight years.

1361135811.0	18pket	Don't Take iPhones From Strangers	ScrewSnow	148	51	91	"I am an active user in many IRC chatrooms. In fact, at the moment I'm in 54 chatrooms. The fact is, I'm younger and I have met a lot of really freaking creepy people in chatrooms. However, I have never met someone as frightening as John.

After signing up for a website in Mid-April of 2012, I saw that someone was advertising their IRC chatroom in a post on said website. I decided to give it a go. The first person to say hi to me was John. He recognized my nick on the site and welcomed me warmly. At first I thought he was a completely normal human being...

Oh how wrong I was.

After talking for a little less than a week, he found out my last name. I only knew this as he tried to friend me on Facebook. I am not one to advertise myself online so I went and chatted with him. 

""How and why did you find out my real name?""

""I just want to become best friends. :)""

This man is 22. I am 14. Being extremely creeped out by him finding out my name, I ignored the Friend Request and blocked him from FaceBook.

Trying to ignore how creepy it was, I continued to talk to him. One day he brought up a conversation about his dying iPhone. I told him how I've fixed several iPhones of his model and offered some help. He got confused when I sent him a couple of links to parts to fix his phone (even thought he works for a mobile phone place) and he got confused. 

""How about you just give me your phone number and I'll help you? :)"" - John

""Uh.. I'm not exactly comfortable with that, how about I just explain it here.""

""I'm thinking of just buying a used iPhone on eBay, how about you give me your address and I'll send you my current iPhone free of charge? :)""

This should have clued me that he was trying to find out everything about me. I shrugged it off as if he was just trying to be nice.

Again, I was wrong.

I was then talking to another kid my age on IRC (Tony) who had given John his address. John had sent him a letter with blood on it. Very creepy and is considered as Bio-Hazard. 

This is when I stopped talking to John. Somehow, he found out my home chatroom and my run-away chatroom. He joined both and will not leave. In fact, I have talked to several other people from other IRC networks and they all think he's a pedophile due to the way he acts.

I found out recently that John had been arrested in 2009 for touching another person inappropriately. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What I have found recently:

John doesn't really know my address, he lied just to scare everyone. He had been threatened to be banned by 90% of the servers he idles on. Let's thank the cooperation of those servers and caring enough to think about the process of banning him. (He will just keep coming back, over and over again.)

I added a link at the bottom, on the case. I don't know what it is with my home town, Sidney, Ohio. But I have met some serious creeps in my time. I no longer live there and rarely return for visits. 

My aunt Linda dated a guy for a while named Mike in the early or maybe mid 90's. She met him at work and they dated for nearly a year. He came to family barbecues and birthday parties and holiday dinners, he was really nice and seemed like a really normal guy. They broke up and it was pretty uneventful.

 In Sidney, news spreads pretty quickly. I was out with a friend and when we got to her house her mom said ""Oh, Thank God you guys are ok! Some girls your age were just found murdered."" We found out that police were looking for a man named Mike Hensley, he killed 3 girls who I had went to school with for years in his home and went to a friends house where he killed the friend and the friends wife. (I may be slightly off on my details because it's been ages and I'm typing from memory of the events) My mom confirmed to me that night that it was the guy my aunt had dated. 

Saturday came, a few days had passed since the murders. Our town was going to appear on America's Most Wanted that night. Mike showed back up in town and had a long stand-off with police at a gas station before he was aprehended.

Everyone at the festival was under 18 (I was 17 and the oldest), and while we were in Paris, we were surprisingly unsupervised. Most of our time when we weren't performing as spent walking around Paris alone and taking the metro, etc. I don't speak a single word of French (as did most of the participants) but there were a few girls who were from South Korea who didn't speak English, much less French. 

I was on the metro one day with one of the Korean girls in our group. 2 French men sat across from us and started to speak to us in French, until I apologized and said I don't speak French. Then he got this creepy grin on his face and said (in English), ""ah, foreigners? Come with me, sexy girls..."" and grabbed our arms. Luckily, the train was stopping at that moment so i ripped my arm away and tore my friend away from them too and we ran out of the train. I look back and see that they were running after us and following us, so my friend and I ducked and ran back into the train in another cart. We peeked up just to see them looking around for us.

1351862300.0	12igcf	The therapist who couldn't let go	spookamie	123	24	24	"I saw a law and order episode like this once. I kind of wish it weren't my life.

Well. The story begins earlier this year.  I had just turned 21 and lived in Manhattan with my only friend and companion, my boyfriend of 3 years. He worked a lot and I was by myself at home fairly often as I had taken a semester off from school. I didn't know what to do with my life, I hadn't made any friends at school, I was having difficulties at my shitty retail job with a co-worker who was a bully, and my depression got worse and worse. The first time I went down to the subway tracks and stared at them, I knew it was time to go home.

So that's background info on how I ended up in an intensive outpatient program for depression and bipolar disorder, among many other things. They told me I was a borderline, and I'm sure many of you are familiar with that diagnosis and symptoms, but the ones relevant to the story are that I had horrible boundaries with people and extremely low self esteem, among many other pervasive issues.

Ok. Enough Background. So I get to my group therapy and I've got two therapists, a girl who was pretty helpful, and ""Jim"". Jim was supportive the entire time but formed a close attachment to me.  It didn't bother me throughout my stay because I was just happy to have someone who took an interest in my problems and tried to sort them out.  We would go around group and when it was my turn to share my problems for the day he would go above and beyond for me, trying to get inside my head and make me see things in ways I hadn't before. And when I would talk about my low self esteem and feeling ugly some days, everyone in the group would comment on how great I was, beautiful inside and out, the usual things support groups do. But Jim was the loudest. The most reassuring.

Fast forward to my last day of the program. I was so ready to leave and never look back. Jim had other plans.  He pulled me aside after the last session and looked into my eyes and told me he'd like to keep in touch. He gave me his business card. I took it, thinking he meant for a check-in every once in a while. Nope.  He told me I was beautiful, he was so happy to have met me, he'd like to see me outside of ""this shit box for a drink"", and showed me the scars on his arms from where he had tried to slit his wrists, telling me we were very much the same. And then he made me hug him. It was not optional. He was huge and I am not huge. Not much room for escape.

I have never been more uncomfortable in my life. I tried to rush the goodbye and bolted, called my support system one by one, cried, and tried to move on. 

I go to target with my mother, and I see an unrecognized number calling. I don't answer those **just in case**, and thank god I didn't because it was Jim. From his personal cell. Calling to see how I was. To tell me how beautiful he thought I was ""inside and out"". I got a text message the next morning saying he wanted to make sure I had his personal number (like the voicemail didn't do it?) and then a call from his office phone later that day with ANOTHER voicemail of equal content. 

I saw my individual therapist later that day and told her everything.  She called the center. I filled out a formal complaint.  I don't know what happened to him.

It's really upsetting though because he took advantage of my circumstances and it feels like he preyed on my weaknesses. I felt I had learned enough to move on with my life from that program and after this incident it all seemed so fake and useless. Like I was being fed lines the entire time. It was such a shame.  I will never see a male therapist again. I do not open up so quickly anymore. All because one fucked up dude got into the wrong line of work.

1348080782.0	105dyt	Red Lights in Suburbia	lebenalles	104	8	15	"So I live in a city that has a decent population (200K) but is mainly suburbia with a lot more residential areas than seemingly anything else.  We have our crime, of course, but just like anywhere it's usually either connected to where you live or who you associate with.  I've lived here most of my life and have pretty much always felt safe, even at night in our poor excuse for a downtown.  This is the only incident that has happened to me here that seems worthy for this thread.

Anyways, about six years ago I was driving home from a friend's house pretty late at night...probably around 2 or 3 am.  I was on a road that during the day is pretty busy, but at that time of night is quite desolate.  It's most residential with no late night businesses or gas stations, and little if any traffic.  I was only a few minutes away from my apartment and had driven this road many times without incident.

Just as I was coasting to a stop at a redlight, I see a figure on the sidewalk beside the road, standing right by the white line where my car was about to come to a stop.  Despite the fact that there were absolutely no other cars around, nor businesses, I tried to shake off my rising paranoia, telling myself that it was just some teenager walking home after a late night with a friend.  But of course I could hear my dad's voice in my head nagging me about always paying attention to my surroundings and to be extra safe (You all know the speech that Dad's put on loop as soon as their daughter is old enough to know what 'bad people' are).  So I decided to make sure everything was locked.

  By some miracle, it was.  Just after I came to a stop, the guy starts walking toward my car.  I couldn't make much out of his features since it was dark out and I was freaking the hell out, but he looked to be in his twenties, was wearing a hat, and seemed pretty pissed off.  Before I knew it, he was yanking on my door handle, yelling for me to open the door and let him.  Because of course that's going to make feel at ease and let him in for a nice chat.  Stupidly, instead of running the damn red light like a sane person would do at this time of night, I sat there, trying to obey the law while some guy tried to take my car door off its hinge.  (Reallly, past self...really??).  As soon as it turned green, I punched the gas, leaving the guy screaming behind me.  

I probably should have called the cops, but again, apparently back then I was an idiot, so instead I just called a friend, told him what happened, and made him stay on the line til I was safely in my apartment.  Needless to say, it took me a long time to get to sleep that night."	t5_2t3t8	True

As I was about to enter the library, a very strange looking guy, about 5 and a half feet tall approached me.  He was black, with a lighter skin tone, and had kind of a big forehead and buggy eyes.

To really paint this story for you guys, allow me to explain that I am a white (this is actually a relevant detail) male, and at this point in time I was 19, overweight, and had long curly hair and a beard.

Anyways, this odd looking guy walks up to me outside the library and asks if I have the time.  I found this question to be kind of strange, as at my University, the library is right next to a giant clock tower.  Also, this guy was wearing a watch (I was proud of myself for noticing these details, but shortly you will see how my detective skills failed me completely when I needed them.)  However, I told the guy the time, and just kept along my way.

I headed into the elevator in the library (the computers were on the 3rd floor), and I noticed this guy got on the elevator with me.  I figured it might have been a coincidence, so I just shrugged it off.  But when I got off on my floor, he stops me again.  And he proceeds to make one of the strangest requests I've ever heard.

He tells me that he is part of a program that sends high school students to our University (this was actually feasible, as our university did this all the time), to take college courses.  He said that he was part of a Science class, and he was asked to approach a stranger, and see if the length of his foot was equivalent to the length of his forearm.

This guy already is giving me the creeps, so I ask him, ""What course exactly is asking you to do this?""  And he replies with (I shit you not), ""Science Class.""  I tell him that this is college, and there is no such thing as Science Class, and I proceed to walk away.

He follows me and bothers me once more.  He says, ""Look, can you please help me out?  You don't even need to take your shoes off.  Just sit down and let me look at your foot and forearm and see if the length is the same.""

Now, I have a feeling I am going to get some major hate from this thread for this, but let me defend myself before I tell the rest of the story.  I am absolutely exhausted at this point in the day.  I have been lifting heavy shit for about five hours, and I just want to check my e-mail in peace.  Further, I have not made the oh so important connection that this guy is a foot fetishest at this point.  So finally, to shut the little bastard up, I tell him, ""Fine."" 

So we go to a corner in the library, and we sit, with him across from me.  At this point, he asks me to take off my shoe.  At first I'm about to protest the he just said I could leave my shoes on, but at this point I just want him to fuck off.  So I do so.  

He proceeds to just stare at my foot, and begins breathing really heavy and starts lightly grunting.  This is the point where (yes, in hindsight I feel like an idiot for letting things progress this far) I realize that this guy is getting off sexually looking at my foot.  So at this point, I just grab my shoes, and run barefoot out of the cafeteria.  I actually run up to the fifth floor, in case he tries to follow me (I figured he would naturally assume I was going to leave). 

I went the rest of the day and didn't encounter him again.  

I could end the story at this point, but I was actually fairly pissed off about this whole situation.  I was pissed at myself for giving into his stupid ploy, and pissed at some creep for tricking me into giving him some fap material.

And as luck would have it, I was given an opportunity to seek revenge on this creep.

Some time later (maybe a few months), I saw this guy's picture appear as a friend of one of my acquaintances on Facebook.  Out of curiosity, I looked at his profile (privacy settings were more relaxed back then, I believe), and, most importantly, saw his AOL Instant Messager Screen Name.

So I created a fake screen name, pretending to be a girl, and proceeded to have a conversation with him,

I told him I was a sorority girl, and that I got his screen name from a friend.  I don't remember the specifics, but I just remember talking very flirtatiously with him.  He proceeded to flirt back, and I spent a few conversations just building a rapport with him.

Finally, I wanted to mess with this guy a little, so at one point we start talking about what things people are into sexually.  I remember telling him that some people are into the weirdest things, and proceeded to give a very long list of fetishes.  I stuck the word feet in the middle of this list of maybe 10 things (ex: animals, bondage, wax, feet, clowns etc...).  

And he isolated my one example of feet.  He replies with, ""Feet?  Gross! How can someone be into something that's so stinky!  That's nasty.""  I took satisfaction in this, and ended the conversation without any other interesting comments.

In our next conversation, I went for my final gambit.  I told him that I was at a party, and a guy at the party said he had heard of my online friend that I was telling everyone about (honestly, this guy must be an idiot, because I probably did the most cliched job of pretending to be a sorority girl).  This guy at the party said my online friend was a freak who used to harass people and look at their feet on campus.

The creep at this point responded with the most bizarre response ever.  He said something along the lines of

""What?  I only did that once, and it was for a psychology class [yes, he changed the discipline].  It was with some hairy Mexican guy, and his feet were so nasty.  I didn't even want him to take his socks off [to be fair, my feet did probably smell like shit after my work shift.]""

I think at that point, I got my revenge and embarrassed this guy.  I never logged onto that screen name again.

Eventually the creep started becoming a regular at the cafeteria I worked at.  But, we never made eye contact.  I don't know if he ate their by coincidence, or if he really had a fascination with me.  But we never had any contact again.

I realize this isn't as scary as some of the other posts on here, but it was my own little experience with a creep.   I thought you folks might find it interesting.

(24 female now)

When I was around 16-17 years young my friends and I would go to this country dance ""club"" called the Country Barn, way out down a back road which was actually somewhat popular considering I'm from a small town. The Country Barn was more populated with adults trying to relive their glory days, though. 

Anyways, my friends and I always went there just to dance, act goofy, play pool, and have fun. When slow songs would come on all the guys would ask all the ladies for a dance. It was pretty adorable. It was locally owned by an older couple who were extremely nice and good Christians. They had a son who was about 26 if I remember correctly, his name was David. He would never ask anyone to dance and would occasionally play with the band playing his guitar. 

After about five visits to the Country Barn my friends and I noticed that David would watch our group dance. Near the end of the night at the last slow song David approached me and asked for the last dance. My friends were all giggling because they thought David was the cutest thing they'd ever seen so I accepted. Before I left he asked me if he could call me so I gave him my number. Stupid me. 

About a week later my best friend Bethany and I are at my house around 3 am having a sleep over and just talking when my cell phone rings. Odd enough at 3am, but I answer it anyways. ""hello?"" nothing. So I hang up. About 20 minutes later I get another call so I answered it again ""hello?"" ...nothing. ""hellooooo?"" I said again. Then I could hear breathing. I look at my friend and put it on speaker and say ""hello? I can hear you breathing"" and then Bethany and I both hear a moan. Disgusted I hung up. 

Over the next two weeks I keep getting call/voicemails like that and just ignored it out of disgust, hoping they'll stop. That weekend my friends and I go back to the Country Barn to just have fun. David see's us come in and smiles and walks toward us. As soon as he approaches us he smiles and says ""hey Tiffany, I've enjoyed talking to you on the phone"". Weird. I haven't talked to David on the phone, yet, and I tell him so. ""no, you have. I just don't say much because I get nervous on the phone. I love the sound of your voice, though"". Okay. So I say ""that's been you calling me from 3-7 in the morning?"" and he smiles and nods like its the most normal thing ever. At this point my friends are walking to the pool table because they're feeling ""awkward"" (thanks, ladies. I'm feeling peachy right now, don't worry!) so I politely tell him, ""David, I don't think we should talk on the phone anymore. It makes me uncomfortable"" all of a sudden he looks extremely pissed off and walks away while saying ""well fuck you then, bitch!"" okay. Thats enough Country Barn for the rest of my life. So I round up the ladies and take them all home but Bethany. 

Bethany practically lived at my house back then. School nights/weekends, she was always there. About 4 nights after the Country Barn incident on a Wednesday we were getting ready for sleep since we had school in the morning. After I turn my bedroom light off and crawl in bed, (or jump is more like it considering I'm terrified of the dark) my phone rings so I answer it as usual with a ""hello?"". Nothing. But the number was familiar as my creepy caller, David, so I put it on speaker and say ""David, this isn't funny. Please stop calling me"" and then bethany and I both look at each other with disgust as we hear a woman moaning saying things like ""oh, fuck me harder"" ""oh David!"". Ew. So I hang up and try my best to sleep. Calls like that happened nearly every weekend for about four weeks. I stupidly ignore them yet again hoping they'll stop on their own. 

About three weeks after the last call my friends begged me to take them back to the Country Barn. I obviously said no multiple times but gave in once Bethany suggested that since the calls stopped David must be out of town. Teenage logic, it's the best. So as we get to the Country Barn there's no sign of David. Good. So my friends and I play a game of pool. As we're finishing up David walks in with a very petit girl who looks like she's never seen a cheeseburger in her life. Poor girl also has a bruised cheek and a black eye. My friends and I just decide to avoid him the rest of the night and that we would leave if he approached us. 

Half way through the night the girl who came in with David approaches me as I'm getting a mountain dew from the concession stand. ""hey I'm Brittany"" 
""hi there, I'm Tiffany"" 
""I know. David has told me all about you. He's mine now so stay away from him and STOP trying to break us up or I'll beat your ugly ass!""
This didn't set well with me for multiple reasons. One, she looks like she's 10 years old now that she's closer. Two, I haven't been trying to do anything involving David. And three, I don't take to well being threatened. So I replied ""I never talk to David. He's too old for me and he's bat shit crazy in my opinion"" 
""yeah well I'm 14 and gave him my virginity so I'll be damned if some old woman will take him away from me!""
....I'm only 16-17, okay. So I say ""and it looks like you're bat shit crazy as well, have a nice life"" and walk away to round up my girls and get the hell out of there. 

As we're walking to my car David runs out and says ""Tiffany, baby, why are you leaving? Brittany is just jealous because I love you more. Just ignore her sweet heart"" yuck. Okay, just yuck. I get in my car lock the doors and leave. When I get home I tell my dad everything. He's a little pissed at me for ""talking"" to a 26 year old but more pissed at David and worried for the crazy little 14 year old. 

Turns out my dad knew the owners pretty well and went to their house to have a talk with them. David had been living in one of their rental homes for a few months and a runaway (Tiffany) was living in the basement without anyone's knowledge but David. David's family paid the little girls mother a whole bunch of money to keep it quiet, which she accepted I suppose since I never seen any news articles about it. (I would be out for blood, personally, if someone hit my child and slept with them. Morons). David's father promised my dad he would take care of it and it wouldn't happen again. My Das figures David will get his ass beat and possibly go to jail and that'll be the end of it. Wrong. David got to go to Europe for a year on mommy and daddy's dime so he would ""cause anymore trouble"". I don't know where David is now and I don't care. My number was changed a week later. 

I don't go to the Country Barn anymore and neither do my friends or anyone else that my dad or I tell the story too. 

TL/DR : if a 26 year old man can't find a girl friend his own age, there is a reason for it. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1343457840.0	xafrl	People watching gone wrong		125	31	29	" Hay r/letsnotmeet. So, I'm a woman in my early 20s. I dress pretty 'punk' and have blue hair. For those reasons, I'm no stranger to unwanted negative attention but I'm usually able to put the kibosh on it pretty fast. I usually don't get all shaken up for nothing but I just got shaken up tonite.

 I was coming home from being out today and had to take a train in from NYC. Before I went to go home I thought I'd walk around for a bit cause it's Friday night and I like to people watch. I got some drunk assholes in my face on the way but that's pretty harmless whatever.

 While I'm walking up the main road some guy who is smoking a cigarette against a building comes up to me. He asks me my name and if I want to hang out. Honestly, I thought he was selling drugs so I told him 'No, not right now thank you'. He proceeds to shove me and tries to pull my headphones off. I couldn't tell if he was trying to flirt or what, didn't seem like he was trying to rob me. I push him away and tell him 'wow, that's not okay'. He shoves me again and this time tries to snatch my glasses off my face. I push him away harder this time and tell him 'Leave me the fuck alone and go the fuck back to Parsippany or wherever the fuck you came from'. He starts swearing and saying he's gonna 'beat my fucking ass' and that I'm a 'nasty fucking bitch'.

 I haven't stopped walking this whole time mind you. He proceeds to walk with me up the street all the while trying to talk me and saying how I shouldn't have gotten up in his face/how i'm deserving of getting my teeth knocked out. I told him we were done talking and he needed to leave me alone. He didn't really seem drunk or crazy. Just super weird and angry.

 I stopped walking and he continued for a bit while I stared his ass down. I tried to continue walking on the street but he would hold back so he could walk with me. I stopped again and told him to walk on while I death glared. I turned the corner and he walked on forward. I was paranoid as heck and kept checking my back to see if he was still following me.

 I went over to the river to chill out and look at the city. Stayed there for a half hour or so and decided to take public trans home. I walked the couple blocks back to the train and saw this lunatic sitting on a bench right near the train station. I ignore him and walk on by. This crazy guy smiles and waves at me. WTF. I look back and see him wave again. I walked to the end of the block and called my brother cause I had enough. I didn't want to get on the subway while this dude was around cause I didn't want to get stuck underground or in the same train with him.

 My brother's not picking up. The dude has started to walk himself over to my end of the block. I cross the street and walk the opposite direction towards where I saw a group of cops earlier. He calls out to me, ""You're going the wrong way!"". I really don't want to talk to the cops because 1. fuck that 2. i had some herbal refreshment on me. I stood around them for a while until I didn't see him anymore and took a not-main entrance into the subway.

 This subway has several entrances and I tried to sneak into a side one. I was on a fairly empty platform while the one across the way was mad crowded. I'm sitting down there still being paranoid and looking around. All of a sudden I see the dude peek down the stairs across the platform and then jump off real fast. It was as if he was gonna try to come to my side without me noticing. I ran up the stairs to meet him above ground and saw him just as he was walking away from the stairs.

 I locked eyes with him and growled, ""You need to leave me the fuck alone! I don't know you! You've been following me around for the last hour! Get the fuck out of here!"" Everyone upstairs is staring at us. He's grinning/looking like a hurt puppy and headed for the turnstile to leave. I just keeping saying, ""Go"", while pointing at him and the exit. I told him if I saw him again I was going to get the cops upstairs(not true) and there would be trouble. So, he leaves and goes back to the street. I wait there for a while to see if he comes back down(he didn't) and then head back to the platform to wait 30minutes for my train.

 This guy really freaked me out. I didn't know what he wanted from me and I wasn't quite sure how to act. I just knew I didn't want to talk to him or be in his vicinity. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1343364502.0	x8dsp	Thank Dog For That Mission Abort. 	perpetualmayhem	114	16	46	"I may have been making something out of nothing as I was only about 12 years old, but hey, I might as well share right? For a bit of background, I had begged my parents for a dog for as long as I can remember, starting at probably around 3 or 4 years old. Finally, when I was 11, they took me to the SPCA for Christmas and we found Bo, an abused and neglected one year old black lab/chow mix who was actually SUPER loveable and became my shadow immediately (he's still my best pal). Although very nice and shy, he was terrified of men, and whenever anyone came to our door he would go nuts and sometimes become somewhat vicious, this was/is annoying but ended up being what potentially saved me and my brother/our house that summer.

It was a fairly typical day, my mom and dad were at work, my little sister was at my grandparents house and my brother (10 at the time) and I were left to our own devices at home. We left the door unlocked since its such a small and secure town and were just in the living room watching TV when Bo started to growl a bit. This was not unusual, he does this often and we usually just take him to the door, he sniffs it a bit, then he's fine. However this time, while walking to the door, I noticed a strange vehicle parked in front of my house. It was running and a man was just sitting in it. I decided not to get too freaked out and simply went and locked the door just in case, then went back to watching TV. Being a naive and sheltered 12 year old girl, I felt fairly secure with my guard dog, locked door and nearby phone. 

About 15 minutes later, my brother got up to get a drink and pointed out that the man was still sitting in his car and appeared to be talking to either himself or on a cell phone rather aggressively. We started to get a bit freaked out and decided to watch him from a window that he wouldn't be able to see us through due to the angle. Soon after, the man got out of the car (we still didn't recognize him), looked around, and started to walk towards our house. At this point I was grabbing the phone and calling my mom while silently thanking myself for having the common sense to lock the door.

When the man got up the steps to our door, Bo started growling very low in his throat, a more threatening growl than I'd ever heard, but its when the man started trying to open our door that he got really pissed. He jumped at the door and started snarling, barking the most vicious bark I'd ever heard from a dog in person before. The man must have realized that breaking into a house with that vicious sounding of a dog was a bad idea because my brother and I saw him booking it back to his car and speeding off right away. 

My mom got home about five minutes after the man left and when we told her what happened, she decided to take back hating that Bo barks when people come to the door. We never filed a police report because we didn't see the plate number and there was nothing that stood out about his car. It may have been nothing, but even if it was, I'm sure glad I have Bo.

1332124881.0	r2vus	Man In My Home	Social_Awkwardness	139	44	59	"This story is true and occurred two months ago, in January. 

I’d like to start off by giving a little background info about myself. I am a 16 year old female who lives in a somewhat suburban area in the city that I live in. I have a side job, if you may call a job at all, where I walk my neighbor’s dog a few times a week for some spare cash. Being a teenager and all, we enjoy not having to rely on our parents for every little thing. Anyhow, the route I walk the dog goes down random streets and through a parking lot behind a middle school, which I always have an eerie feeling about when I walk down the shady drive which, occasionally, has cars parked with tinted windows. I guess this would be a good time to share that I have a secret fascination with /r/LetsNotMeet, /r/NoSleep, Criminal Minds, and CIS, which I may add, makes me quite paranoid about my surroundings when I’m out and about. To close, I do not know how this man found me, or why he chose my home to break into. I still shudder when I wonder if he has been watching me for God knows how long without me having the slightest clue. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

It was a night in the middle of January and, being in the New England area, it was cold as fuck. I guess I was in a half like stage of sleep because I was awoken by my cat, who sleeps at the foot of my bed on a regular bases. Usually when he wakes me up, he goes off on a little meowing rampage, telling me it is finally time for him to exit my room. But this night was different. He was standing in front of me on my bed, facing the door, which was slightly closed. He had a rigid posture and his fur was standing on end. But the noise. The noise he was making was what really got my attention. For those who have a feline friend, you will know the type of noise a cat makes when they are not in a very happy state. Here is what it sounds for those who don’t know: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrbTeATxycc 
I instantly knew something was wrong because my cat only made that noise when another animal was in his presence, or another human being he did not recognize. “Jasper, what’s wrong kitty?” I whispered to him as I petted his head, trying to calm him down. I kept glancing at the door which was where his eyes were continually fixed. And then I heard it. It was quiet, but with my cat starting to freak me out, my ears were perked for any slight noise. It was a small squeak from the stairs that were located across the hall. It was common for my stairs to squeak, since they are old, but they only did when someone was climbing them. My mind raced as I tried to think who it could be. My mother was asleep, (she went to bed before I did), my brother was asleep for a fact, since I would hear his snores from down the hall, and my father is in Europe, and wouldn’t be coming home till next week. I threw the covers off my legs and placed my feet on the cold floor. I carefully made my way across the room, over to my door, making sure I didn’t make any of the floorboards give away my consciousness. I peeked behind my door and into the hallway, making sure I couldn‘t be seen. My was heart pounding so loudly that it drowned out any other noises. And then I saw the large dark figure ascending the stairs. I clasped my hand over my mouth, as I watched the foreign figure finally get to the top step, and then stop. I was in complete shock, and just stood there like a dumb girl. The figure looked around my family’s second floored home, until stopping its gaze on my door. He then started to move slowly toward me door, taking his time. I must have stood there for about 10 seconds until I saw the light reflecting from his hand. My eyes widened, as I started scrambling backwards. “Shit, shit, shit!” I hissed under my breath. I looked around my room furiously. *Where the hell can I hide?!* Under the bed or in the closet is too obvious… And, well, that was it. There was no other place to hide. If I scream, he might kill my mother when she comes running to the rescue. And my cellular device was downstairs charging. *Oh, Christ on a bike, I’m going to die.* I then remembered for some hell of a reason a movie I watched recently called ‘Sleepover’, a chick flick. Anywho, the girl climbs out her window to go out with her friends. I look at my window, then back at my door, and then I sprint. I grab my continually sound making cat off my bed and put him under my arm, I rip my curtains off my window and, with violently trembling hands, I slid my window open, and jumped, the cold crisp air wrapping around my body. My cat, going into survival mode, stabs his claws into my side, while we hurl out the window. When I hit the ground, I, surprisingly, land on my feet. The pain that shot up my legs was horrendous, but with my adrenaline high, I kept moving. The cold ground numbed my feet as I ran, since I was only wearing a pair of thin sweats and a tank top, and it was well below 30 degrees. I ran across my street to my neighbors’ house, which contained four guys (all in their almost/ early twenties) and their parents. The lights in their living room were on, and I let out a sob of relief as I ran up their porch. I banged on their front door, hiccupping and sniffling as my tears soaked my face. One of the guys opened the door and looked at me in confusion (it was 2 AM). “I-I n-need h-help.” I mustered out. The rest of his family came to the door, surrounding me as I told them what happened. The four guys and their dad set off toward my house, but not before the dad got his shot gun. Their mum sat me on the couch, wrapped me in a blanket, and called the police. I sat on the couch shaking, clinging to my cat. 
------------------------------------------------------------------

To finally conclude this tremendously long story, my four guy neighbors and their father went into my home and got my mother and brother out. When the police came, they searched my home, noting that my back sliding porch door’s lock has been tinkered with, and was broken. They finally found the man, hiding under my bed, holding a machete like knife. They arrested him, you know, the usual. I have sleeping problems now. My mum has to sit next to me until I fall asleep, like she always did when I was a child in my early years in elementary school. I still do not understand why that man had come into my home. Was it me that he was looking for? If so, why did he choose me out of all the other more estrogen-ized girls in my town? "	t5_2t3t8	True
1331633523.0	qucwj	The Partyvan Makes a Late Call	Reddit_guard	122	26	23	"So I've been whittling the night away by reading these stories, and I figure I may as well share one of my own.  

A little over two years ago, I was taking my fall semester off so that I could better prepare myself for college life.  Seeing as I was the only jobless licensed driver in my house, I assumed the responsibilities of sibling chauffeur.  My sister was just entering high school at the time. Thus, she was quite the social butterfly.  

The implications?  Many of my weekend nights were spent in a fashion circa ""Taxicab Confessions: The PG-13 Version."" I would often drive her and her two ""besties"" to and from their ""parties"" among other social endeavors.  

I for one was growing weary of the impersonal nature of these drives, so I began to talk to them and subsequently found them to be rather enjoyable in conversation.  One night while coming home from a party, they decided that they wanted to go to their favorite hang-out spot: an elevated concrete curb across the way from my house.  At this point in the night, there were no lights on; everything was pitch black.  I wondered why they would hang out there of all places, but offered to accompany them lest anything unfavorable happen.  

We parked my car in my driveway and walked across the street.  After reaching the curb, we all sat down and dangled our feet from it.  My sister and her friends were reluctant to talk; I assume my presence was impeding what they had intended to be a boy-free hangout.  Suddenly, a white Dodge Astrovan (oh how stereotypical) passed us.  

My sister remarked, ""Oh look, the partyvan is making rounds!""

We all laughed and then proceeded to make small talk.  After a few minutes, headlights shone their way down the street again.  My sister joked that the partyvan had forgotten something.  Lo and behold, she was right.  

The van from earlier rounded a turn approximately two blocks down from us, and proceeded towards us.  However, it was driving at what seemed to be ~5mph (on a 25mph street).  It slowly crept towards us, and its movement was unshaken by the stop signs between us.  It eventually came to a stop no more than a football field's length away from us.  ""Creepy,"" I thought.

Upon stopping, the headlights ceased to shine.  A door's opening cut short the silence, and a shadowy figure emerged from the vehicle.  ""Perhaps he lives on this street; no need to worry."", I thought.  

Any and all rationalizations died when the driver started towards us with a flashlight.  At this point, I was on auto-drive.  

""Run.""  

My sister and her two friends obliged, and they darted through a neighboring house's backyard.  As they sprinted, his steps increased in vigor and speed.  He was hellbent on catching up to them, and he would have nothing with me.  I decided then to break his focus.

""Can I help you, sir?""

His steps did not cease, but he did reply.

""This doesn't concern you.""

This retort came as quite a shock to me, but I proceeded to let him know that I was rather concerned seeing as my teenage sister was involved.

At that point, he cared little for what I had to say.  It was time then for another approach.  I sprinted in front of him and demanded that he stop following the girls.  He looked up at me in utter disbelief for a second, and then attempted to push me aside.  My adrenaline and instincts overrode any desire to keep the situation peaceful.  I took the man by his collar, charged him into the side of his car, and told him that he had better leave lest I involve the authorities (a retired police officer lives a few doors down from me, so it wouldn't have been hard).  

He then kneed me in the nether region and used my crumpled state as an opportunity to escape.  But, before he entered his car door, he turned to me and grinned the most evil of grins.  He took a knife from his pocket and twirled it around his fingers.  I was frozen at this point, ready for anything.  However, he did not make any attempt to attack me.  Instead, he pointed it in the direction of the girls' escape as he stared at me, maintaining the grin. He then backed into his van and hastily drove away, seeing as the girls had already made it to the house and were well away from the scene at this point.  Thankfully, nothing ever came of this situation, though I will always regret not remembering the license plate (damned adrenaline).  

Tl;dr - Yet another creepy story involving a van of some sort."	t5_2t3t8	True
1371012987.0	1g6dzx	Either you're coming with me or I'm going with you	ZowieIndianaJones	118	19	30	"So this happened a few years back. I had just graduated high school, was living on my own and had recently started dating a guy that I had been really good friends with all throughout junior high and high school.

Anyway, him and a mutual friend of ours had gone out for drinks downtown. By the time we left the bar it was quite late and most of the transit was pretty much shutting down. We ran to the closest bus stop and waited for a good 15-20 minutes before the last bus of the evening arrived. But it didn't stop. I made eye contact with the bus driver and he just drove past us, smiling. I was livid. So I walked, head down, assuming my boyfriend and our friend were in tow. By the time I got to the closest train station I realized that I was now alone at this point. I waited at the station for about 10 minutes hoping they'd catch up but saw no sign of them. So I hopped on the train thinking they'd be at the station we had to get off at.

I got off at my stop and had spent the whole train ride preparing a big speech for them about how they really shouldn't abandon an 18 year old girl downtown in winter... at night. I looked around but didn't see them anywhere. At this point I was tired and a bit annoyed so I decided to catch the last bus home and deal with it tomorrow.

As I was sitting alone at my stop in the bus loop, a man approached me. He was wearing a big leather jacket with a hoodie underneath and a pair of ratty jeans. He was a tall guy with scruffy hair and a bit of a beard. Average looking guy. He asked me how to get to a certain community, but I can't remember what one it was now. I told him to hop on the southbound train for about 4 stops and that'll get him where he needs to be but that he'd better hurry because the last train is in about 5 minutes.
Then he just stood there, looking around. He walked closer to me and sort of stood over me as I sat on the bench. Then he asked where I was going. I told him I was just going home.
He then, obviously feeling comfortable enough, sat down beside me and started asking me questions. I was getting nervous but have always been (and still unfortunately am) too nervous and polite to do anything but smile and answer.

After a few minutes of this uncomfortable back and forth I saw my bus pull into the loop and make it's way towards us. I told him that I had to get going and that he should call a cab, they'd know how to get him to where he needed to go.
I quickly hurried onto the bus and sat down, looking at my ipod. Anything to avoid making eye contact with him through the window. But to my dismay, I looked up to see him getting on the bus and hurrying down the isle to grab the seat next to me.
I did a nervous smile and told him he needed to go the opposite direction that I was going and this bus would only take him even further from his destination.
He just laughed saying things like ""oh no, it's fine."" and ""I'll just go with you and then we can go to a bar near you."" and then he dropped the scariest line, ""Either you're coming with me, or I'm going with you.""

My mind was racing. I had two options (well, now that I think of it with a bit more than a teenage brain, I had several) I could take the bus and have him follow me, come into my house where he would probably rape and murder me and my roommates OR I could get off the bus, go with him to the strip club across the street and ditch him there. My parents only lived about a 15 minute walk from this train station so I could just spend the night there.
I went with option number 2.

So I told him we'd go to the peelers. The entire way there I was trying to walk quickly and avoid talking to him but he kept leaning in and trying to hold my hand, at one point attempting to kiss my neck. I was noticeably distressed at this point and I think the bouncer could see something was up.

We went in and the creeper guy sat us in the far corner of the bar, sort of in shadows. Then he completely stopped talking and began to stare at me putting his hand on my leg, which I'd quickly remove. I kept asking him why he didn't want to look at all the 'hot, naked babes dancing around' and he would always respond with ""Well, they aren't real, like you. I can't reach out and touch them..."" then after the third time he responded with that he put his hand out to touch my face. I backed myself away from him and I noticed he sort of jolted forward a bit as if to jump up and stop me had I attempted to make a run for it.
I told him I needed to go to the bathroom so he stood up and told me that he was going to step out for a smoke, but he leaned right close into me and whispered ""but don't you go ANYWHERE."" and headed for the door.

I was in a complete panic now. I grabbed my coat and put it on as fast as I could and pulled the hood tight to cover my face. I made a mad dash for the door. As I rushed out I didn't notice that I had ran right by the man. He managed to catch me and grabbed my wrist pulling me into him so hard that my hood fell off.
He asked where I was running off to and why? He said he had a nice hotel room and had a full evening planned for us. I couldn't go just yet. Then he pulled out a 100 dollar bill and offered me that.
I was distraught. I started crying saying that I just wanted to go home. I have a kitten, I just got him. I needed to go feed him. He didn't like being alone at night.
But the man just said, he'd get us a cab and we'd feed my kitten then go to his hotel. At this point he had around 300 dollars worth of bills in his hand, trying to persuade me. 
I pulled my arm free and ran. He ran after me, or at least tried to. When I looked back he was being held by the bigger of the three bouncers out front and was being threatened by another.

I managed to run to my parents house and slept between the two of them (much to their displeasure) in their bed. I've never seen him since and I'd like, very much, for it to stay that way."	t5_2t3t8	True
1370212624.0	1fjljz	The Man in Blue	pagan_veela	114	20	7	"This encounter happened when I was about 12 or 13 possibly a little older and my best friend was 3 years younger than me. The town we grew up in was incredibly safe and it was very unusual for us to ever feel unsafe for the most part.  The two of us often hung out in a local park down the street from out houses. The park is quite large and open and backed onto an overgrown field and a small little wilderness type area. 

On this particular day we were hanging out on the top of a the giant metal slide which gave a great view of the whole park and the field at the back of it. We are sitting there chatting and I notice something blue at the tree line between the field and the wilderness. I notice it move closer and figure it is someone walking a dog or something in the field. 

The figure just stands there for awhile not moving just standing perfectly still. I start getting a little creeped out and point out the person to my friend. She starts yelling at the person ""hey smurff man we aren't afraid of you"" because she is an idiot. Suddenly the figure starts moving again towards us. Getting closer and moving quite fast. We freak out and hightail it home as fast as we can.  

That afternoon I am out delivering my newspapers and I walk past the park and can still see a blue figure now in the park area but still pretty far back and it just creeps me right the heck out. The next day as I am preparing my newspapers I am reading one and see and article about an escaped criminal charged with attempted abduction of a young girl. He was described as having been seen wearing a blue windbreaker, blue ball cap and blue jeans possibly armed and considered to be unbalanced and dangerous. A shiver ran through my entire body because I just knew that was the person we had seen in the park the day before. 

I told my mom and she thought I was nuts because the guy had escaped from a few towns over and it seemed impossible for him to have travelled that far. She called the police to give the tip anyway they also seemed sceptical that he would be in out town. 

A couple days later the man is apprehended in a different park in our town trying to abduct another young girl who was playing on her own in the park. It is by far one of the creepiest things that has happened to me and I can vividly remember the vibe from the guy just wasn't right him just standing there for hours in a park.  "	t5_2t3t8	True
1369900833.0	1fbpyf	The worst summer of my life.	Teoodorh	114	18	30	"Hello, just discovered this subreddit yesterday and decided to share my own story.

This happened last summer and started pretty much a year ago. I am a guy who spends quite alot of time in front of my computer (probably too much) and my room back at my parents place has a window facing the road in front of the house. My computer is located next to the window and when I'm sitting by it I have that window to my right side. This means that if someone walks past the house, they can see me by the computer and I often tend to look out the window whenever I see someone walking past in the corner of my eye. No big deal.

So this all started when I noticed this woman, somewhere in her 20's, maybe early 30's, walking by quite often. As in 5-10 times every day. No big deal of course, she probably just lives nearby I thought (which I later found she did). This woman had a very uncomfortable look to her. It didn't look like she had a shower in a while and she had this extreme smile to her face, constantly, as if someone had stapled her face into that expression.

I didn't think much about it until I noticed that she started trying making eye-contact with me. Since she walked by my window so often, I often caught her in the corner of my eye and unintentionally looked at her. Every time she got eye-contact she would start giggling/laughing uncontrollably. This went on for a week or two. I just thought she was mentally ill or something, and didn't think much about it.

Then one day, she walked past an insane amount of times, as in 15-20 times in a couple of hours and each time she was constantly looking into my window when walking by. This is when I started getting uncomfortable. After unintentionally getting eye-contact again I quickly turn my eyes to the computer again only to see in the corner of my eye that she has stopped, standing outside my window and looking right at me, laughing uncontrollably with her creepy smile on her face. I quickly pull the curtains and try to ignore it when I hear the door-bell.

I open the door and there she is. I'm alone home and starting to get some serious creeps. I was at the time ""baby-sitting"" my friends poodle and pick it up to use it as some kind of protection (stupid, I know). I say ""Hi..."" and she responds with a very, very happy ""Hello!"". She then says ""Now it's your turn"". I have no idea what she wants and only responds with ""okey..?"". She then starts laughing, alot, as in she just heard the best joke of her entire life. I start panicking and shut the door after quickly telling her to leave.

I tell my parents when they come home and it turns out that this woman is an old student of my mother. She says that she is mentally ill and that I shouldn't worry. ""She is nice"".

Her visits outside my window continues every day and I tell my parents again that I feel uncomfortable. They then try to talk to her, to see what's up. My mom asks her why she does it and she tells her that her and I have some kind of supernatural connection in our heads and that her and I have conversations with each other through some kind of telepathic way... We are made for each other, and madly in love. That's when my parents are getting concerned. 

Her visits continued on a daily basis and we visit the police to see what can be done. Their answer is that we can't do shit (because of stupid laws in my country).

She often rang my door-bell but I had the sense not to answer. I noticed that as time went on, she got worse and worse mentally. She started to show agressive behavior against my parents when they asked her to leave. I have actually never seen my dad so uncomfortable and overprotective as he was at this time, he was worried aswell. 

One day something happened that was enough for me. It was friday night and I was home alone. I was watching TV and heard strange noises from the street. I peeked out the window and there she was, outside my window dancing, screaming, singing and doing all kinds of strange things. I put all the lights out in my house and pretended not to be home, but I could still hear her. She was outside still. My neighbours ending up calling me several times, asking if I was okay and I said I was... but I wasn't, I was scared. My parents were hours from coming home and all I did was watching TV, pretending not to be home.

She stayed for an hour or two before leaving and the week after, me and my parents decided to take action. We visited different mental hospitals (or whatever you call them) in my county and tried to tell them what happened, but there was one problem, they didn't have her as a patient and couldn't help us. Neither could the police. 

To make the rest of the story short (it has been way too long already), this continued for the entire summer and towards the end, she would often ""spy"" on our house, playing some sick game with a child she had started haning out with. At this point, she was scared of us because she knew we had contacted the police and different doctors and they were shouting things such as ""you see that house, watch out for them or they will call the polics, RUN!"" and she, and the child, would run and come back minutes later, repeating the same thing. The police have visited our block several times, hunting her when she is clearly out of control.

There are so many incidents I can tell you about this story, but it would take way too long to tell everything. I don't live at home anymore and I haven't been bothered by her since, except the time she tried to contact me on FB (she was blocked instantly). That was my summer of 12', not the best of my life...

1355524927.0	14v781	Massage from a pedophile	couerdebanane	127	30	15	"I was a 14 year old girl at the time, and my sister in law and her sister were really into the Rocky Horror Picture show. The legitimate ones at the theater where they act everything out and everyone dresses up, come as you are kind of thing.  I went with them a few times, and they were friends with a lot of people there so I turned off my judgment and decided not to think anything of the serious weirdos that were around.  Granted, there were a few people that they told me to steer clear of because they really were creeps.
So anyway, after the show was over, we were all hanging out in the lobby of the theater and my sister in law and her mom were talking with a group of people.  I was really sore because the day before I did a really hard work out, so I was lightly massaging my back muscles while sitting there hanging out.  A man that was there with us offered to give me a massage, and since I decided no judgment whatever this guy is friends with the people I was with, I accepted.
He was making weird comments like ""If you weren't 14 I would take you home with me"" and others like it, but I was tired and thought he was just a little weird like the rest of the people there.  It was honestly a great massage and I didn't even feel weird about it, but after 10 minutes or so, my sister in law said we should get going. As soon as we were out of ear shot of this man, she told me to stay away from him because he is a registered child molester.
Needless to say I was EXTREMELY freaked out, and pretty embarrassed. I was also a little mad at her for not taking me out of the situation sooner, but she said she didn't know how without making it an awkward situation, and she is very passive aggressive.
It's not life threatening or anything, but this was definitely the creepiest thing to happen to me.

TL;DR I unknowingly got a massage from a pedophile at Rocky Horror Picture Show when I was 14."	t5_2t3t8	True
1339820681.0	v4l2p	Creepy blocked number phone guy	sophelle	101	7	28	"Little back info: I live with my parents, my dad is a coal-mining shift worker (i.e, working from 6pm to 7am at certain times of the month), and I have a loudspeaker tablet for a phone in my room. Also, I recently started working at the grocery store in my small town after not having much of a social life with the people in my town, unlike the rest of my family; so naturally some men in this town have developed an interest, which I have ignored. But anyway...


One monday morning, I was woken up at around 5am to my phone ringing. I was all disoriented and groggy so I missed the first call, the second call (1 minute after the first) I just stared at the phone thinking who would be calling at this time. The third phone call came another minute later and I was awake enough to remember that if the phone rings at 5 in the morning, it either means something may have happened to my dad at work (a major fear of mine) or he is locked out of the house after finishing work. Not the case however.
So i pick up the phone and say hello. No answer straight away. I say hello again, and the person on the end of it whispers 'Sophie'. I say, 'yeah?' He whispers, 'Sophie, are you awake, baby?'. Now, i'm still half asleep and getting pissed off at this point. I say 'What?', he repeats, 'Sophie are you awake, baby?'. Now I'm just getting creeped out and I hang up. I try to go back to sleep. However, he calls again. And again, and again. Around 10 times in quick succession before he gives up.
At this point I am so freaked out, I crawl over my bed to my bedroom door and lock it, then lay in bed, listening for noises out my window which is right at the back of the house.

Then, I hear noises in my kitchen. 

Footsteps. Cupboards opening. The kettle coming on? Coughing.

Thank god, my dad is awake. 

I go out and tell him what has been happening, and the phone starts ringing again. Dad urges me to answer, I say no. He can tell how freaked out I am, so he takes the phone into his bedroom where my mum is awake.
So the phone is gone, and they are awake now, so I'm less freaked out, until my mum brings the answered phone in, and says that the person on the line is 'Tom' and he wants to speak to me. I argue with my mum for a few seconds, as I don't know a Tom, and why the hell is he ringing me at 5 in the morning calling me baby. She hands me the phone and I say hello, hear the same person talking and immediately hang up. Mum asks why, she wanted to know who he was; I say, 'you didn't hear him this morning Mum, he had a really creepy voice'. 


But he keeps ringing, and ringing, and ringing. Throughout the morning, totaling 37 calls from 5am to 11am. I went to work at 11am until 7pm.
When I got home, my mum told me that he rang again, once more at around 2pm, and she answered. He said to her 'Megan, Megan, Megan, I want to fuck you'. No joke. 


So I might have attributed the morning calls to drunk dialing, and he was sobering up which is why he was calling less as the day went on, however, he should have sobered up by the time he called my mum. 


So, this guy knows my name, my mums name, and he knows my home phone number. And he apparently cannot control his sexual urges.

This is why i sleep with my bedroom door locked now.

1332894477.0	rgq2p	[MY] Creepy encounter walking home	IveGotCarpet	107	14	10	"I've spent most of this week reading loads of creepy stories on this sub-reddit which got me thinking about some weird things that have happened to me. The creepiest moment of my life so far will probably seem pretty tame when compared to some of the stuff you read on here but it was still scary none-the-less.
Right, so every saturday me and a couple friends get together to watch UFC. We live in England so this usually means staying up until the early hours of the morning followed by a painfully tiring walk home after it's finished. I live on the other side of town to my friends so whenever we watch it at one of their houses I have to walk a good 6-7 miles to get home (I can't afford a car). This was never a problem though because I dont mind walking as long as I've got a bit of music to keep me company, and I was still a naive 17 year old who thought everyone in my area was friendly and harmless. Needless to say I was proven wrong.

September last year we were watching UFC (I forget which number) but I remember it was Jon Jones vs Rampage because I lost a substantial amount of money on a bet when Rampage got completely dominated. The event went on until around 3am, at which point we all parted ways and set off home. I had made this walk countless times and considered my chosen route perfectly safe, although looking back it was probably the worst route I could have taken. I basically followed the main road for a mile, this led to some back alleys which led to a 5mile home-straight consisting of a highroad to my right and forest/park to my left. In the day time the park was really inviting as it was just like swings, slides and climbing frames completely surrounded by a wall of trees... it was like something straight out of centre parks (not sure if you have those in america), however at night time the lack of lighting made it a stereotypical, almost scoobydoo-like, creepy place.

Anyway I had made it to the home straight without interuption and everything was going as normal, I remember I was listening to ""Hit the road Jack"" by Ray charles at the time... not that it's important to what happened it's just a really vivid memory. I was about 2 miles down this road and just coming up to the dreaded playground when I felt a car coming up behind me with its highbeams on. It wasnt uncommon for cars to pass me on my walks home, minicabs frequently passed me, but it was unusual for their lights to be that bright. I thought nothing of it at first but the lights stayed on me for way longer than they should have. All I was thinking was how has this car not overtaken me yet? I took out one of my headphones and I heard the engine running really slowly like when you pull a car out of a drive. It was at this point I realised the car was literally right behind me. The driver must have seen me notice him because he sped up so he was now going at the exact same as me. Being naive I thought he was probably just wanting directions or something so I stopped to see just what he wanted. As I stopped so did he. I took out my other headphone and said something along the lines of ""hey whats up?"". He didnt say anything he just stared at me. He looked like he was in his mid 40s and not of english decent. My best guess is he was Polish due to his greyish white hair, big build and scruffy appearance. (No offence to any polish people by the way, thats just how the polish people where I live generally look). His blank stare kind of freaked me out so I just stuck my headphones back in and started walking fast down the road.

This was far from the end however, as he again went at my speed staring at me the whole time, not once looking at the road. As soon as he caught my eye he started gesturing me with the ""come hither"" motion, which accompanied with his now grinnning face really freaked me the fuck out. I was genuinely panicing at this point and started weighing up my limited options. I could try and run home, but this would mean running in a straight line for 4 miles, which I probably couldnt do for a start and he would have been able to drive alongside me the whole way. So that option was a no. I could attempt the freak out method and try and act crazy to scare him off, but I had already shown him signs of fear so doing this would probably result in a physical confrontation. I can take care of myself just fine in a fair fight but this guy could have a knife, and axe or a gun so that option was a definite no. In the end I had to go for my third and final option of dart into the forest and hide until he drives off. As much as I didnt want to do it I jumped over the small ditch between the path and the forest and proceeded to hide in a big jumble of bushes like 20 meters in.

At this point my heart was in my throat and I just sat there staring at the road waiting for the lights from the cars headlights to disappear. I must have sat there for what felt like an eternity but was in fact only a couple of minutes... but the light didnt go away. All I could think was please, please just drive away. After several more minutes of the lights just staying there I realised I had to plan another way of getting home or atleast away and I figured the only way was to make the rest of the way through the forest. But I couldnt move, I was genuinely paralysed with fear. It took me a minute to compose myself and then I gradually started shuffling forward. I didnt care how long it took I just had to get home. I edged forward gradually and eventually reached the clearing where the park was. I didnt want to be out in the open so I was tring to think of the best way to get around the park. It was then that I noticed a black silhouette sitting on the swing with its back to me. It could only be him! He must have got out his car to look for me and was just waiting on a swing! Tears were streaming down my face because I was sure that this was it. Once again I found myself paralysed with fear. He hadnt seen me and I dont think that he had heard me, but I felt sick. He just sat there rocking backwards and forwards. I took a deep breath and then sprinted as fast as I could back the way I had came, back through the forest and came out on the edge of the road where the home straight had started. I say sprinted, but it felt like one of those dreams where your legs dont work properly they just shake and wobble uncontrollably. From there I ran all the way back to my friends house. I dont remember much about that journy at all. It felt like one second I was in the forest and the next I was banging on his door still shaking uncontrollably.

He let me in and his parents called the police who came around an hour or so later. I had to go to the station to make a report and give a description of the guy, but they never took it any further because my description didnt match anyone of known danger in the area. When my parents found out they insisted that it be taken further but the police seemed to think that nothing illegal actually happened. Which is fair enough I guess but there is no way of knowing what his intentions were and as far as I'm considered I was near death that night. I think it goes without saying that I never walked home at that time of night ever again and I am now a hell of a lot more paranoid when it comes to strangers."	t5_2t3t8	True

Today was just the normal day of school, nothing out of the usual. Every so often Ill see my boyfriend after school. He lives pretty far from me so I meet up with him, he'll drop me off at the bus stop and wait for my bus with me and I catch the bus home alone. So we've said our goodbyes and I caught the bus home. 

The stop I get off at is right around the corner from my house, a two minute walk tops. Because the weather was so terrible I ended up getting off at my stop later than normal and it was already getting dark. 
I get off and a few cars drive by, a van made a point to honk at me as I was walking along. I glance over and ignore them.This happens all the time so I just ignore this when it happens.

As I reach the start of my court I hear a distinct voice call out

""Hey , what are you doing!""

I glance over my shoulder and see the same van that honked at me before, pretending I didn't see or hear them, I continue home. That was until I glanced over again to see them reversing back to drive down the court. At this point my heart is racing, my brain is telling me to just run but instead I'm power walking to my house. Continuously glancing over I see the van getting closer and closer. That was it. I was on my neighbours lawn when I bolted for my house. When I hit my front door, I looked over quickly to see where they were. Have a guess? They were parked right in front of my house, watching me. I forced the door open and slammed it shut, making a point of locking it behind me. A few seconds after I could hear the van high tailing out of the court. It sounded like they hit the accelerator hard when they left.

1369845184.0	1f9yq7	The painful poop peeper	DasBarenJager	113	18	9	"When I was younger I worked in a pretty busy little restaurant as the only male server. I closed most nights and would come in early to eat and hang out with my friends before my shift, one day in particular I was ill and had to use the bathroom several times. 
I couldn't get anyone to cover my shift so I was SOL. My first trip to the bathroom was right before my shift and I was not in uniform, as I am taking a dump I look out the inch wide gap between the stall door and the wall to see a guy staring at me. We locked eyes for several seconds but he just stood there watching me. I quickly wiped and left choosing to wash my hands in the kitchen rather than be near this guy who was hanging out in the bathroom.
After putting on my uniform shirt and starting my shift I noticed the guy sitting in my section, I asked a coworker and apparently he had already eaten and paid. When I asked if he wanted to order he just kind of smirked at me and asked for water. Over the next couple of hours I had to revisit the bathroom several times and he would wander in shortly after and pretend to wash his hands or something while I had painful diarreah.
I finally had enough when I went to leave the stall and he was standing so close that the door bumped into him as I opened it. For whatever reason that was the thing that pissed me off enough to shout at him and tell him to ""Get the fuck out and stop following me like a goddum psycho!"" I remember that really well because I was so flustered I couldnt even cuss right.
When I was done washing my hands I noticed he had left the building and after that night I never shat in that building again.

So I(female) am a pizza delivery girl. Easy enough. I was at work around 9:30pm when this guy calls. Very whispery, breathy voice. I do my usual greeting:
""Thank you for calling Pizza Hut, this is xcoconutx93, how are you doing tonight?"" After the usual exchange, I find out he is ordering for delivery. He is a new customer so I had to put in all his information. Nothing weird. He tells me he has a coupon for a pizza, and asks if I can give him the discount. I told him ""let me grab my manager and we'll take care of that for you"". He asked for ME specifically to take care of him. After I came back from dealing with my boss, I told him that we discounted him for his coupon. He thanked me. Here's where it gets weird.

He stopped me mid sentence and told me that ""I have a very nice sounding tone of voice"" and that he ""loved hearing me talk, you should be a disc jockey."" I was a little weirded out, but I tried to stay professional. I told him that it was very sweet and I would consider it. He said ""I'd listen to your radio station. Thank you for taking my order tonight, I'll stop by your store and see you sometime soon xcoconutx93.""

I wish I could say it was over, but that isn't true. **Note: this man lives in an apartment complex. What I didn't realize is I had taken the complex's address, but not his apt. number.**

Not 5 minutes later, the man calls back, and my coworker Baleigh answers the phone. I learned after the fact that he had asked for me by name. I picked up the phone and did my greeting again, and he reminded me I forgot to ask for his apt. number. Nothing weird, yet. Again, I thanked him and changed the information. Before I could hang up, this was our conversation:
*Him: xcoconutx93?*
*Me: Yes sir, how can I help you?*
*Him:(Creepy laugh) Are you doing alright?*
*Me: Yes sir, I'm great...*
*Him: Good. I'm going to hang up now. See you soon.*

Baleigh heard the whole story and told my boss to have my male coworker take it. This is what he came back with:
*Bob: First thing he said to me is asking where you were. Ok, so I got there, right? And I knocked on the door. He said in this weird, seductive voice ""come in"", but I was NOT about to go in this guy's house. So I knocked again. He opened the door with a big smile on his face, but saw it was me, and it just dropped. I greeted him and he said ""Oh, where's xcoconutx93?"". I told him you were here(at the store) and he just looked upset. After I took his money, and gave him his food he asked how you were, I told him you were doing alright, and he just said ""good, xcoconut93x is a sweet girl. Tell her I'll see her soon.""*

The fact that he asked the driver to come in, and that he was expecting ME creeps me out. Maybe he's just lonely and wants someone to talk to....but still. Add one more creep to my list!

1366487637.0	1crb8z	Late Night Phone Calls	mouseWfangs	107	12	15	"Good friend of mine and I went to college together and stayed in the same dorms. It wasn't uncommon for the dorm phones to ring with drunk dialers or just plain misdials. The dorm phone numbers were all very similar, and generally the person in the room would change from year to year.

This particular friend of mine is athletic and very good at the cold shoulder, so for the most part has never had an issue with creepers. She picks up the phone one night about 3 am and there's a man on the other end of the phone. He identified himself by first name very readily, I think it was Joe. He asked for some other girl's name and she informed him, rather sleepily, that he had the wrong number and no such girl lived there. He asks what her name is, she gives it. He asks her the standard ""So, what are you wearing?"" She informs him, ""Flannel PJs"" and bids him good night. She thinks this is the end of it.

The next night, again about 3am she the phone rings and he asks for her by name. She informs him she has no interest in speaking with him and not to call again.

However he doesn't stop. He keeps calling night after night. This is particularly worrisome because the dorm phone numbers are formatted such that you can get a good idea where a room is by number and vice versa. She speaks with a friend of the family who is a cop who agrees to put a trace unit on the phone. Her relationship with her roommate isn't above cordial, so the roommate doesn't understand that the trace item needs to stay plugged in because this is a legitimate issue.

Fast forward to Winter break. Friend and I are the only two people we're aware of in the dorms. She is spending time in my room, but needs to go grab something in her room. While in her room for those brief minutes the phone rings. The call trace unit isn't plugged in. She's afraid he is calling because he could see her room's light from the street.

At this time I notice a man walking through the hallways. 

Since that night I've never known if that was someone caring for the dorms doing a round, or a creeper. Fortunately though, my friend no longer picking up the phone seemed to do the trick. 

She's still spooked by men who sound like Joe, and has never felt quite as safe as before."	t5_2t3t8	True

The bus barely had anyone on it, and this older guy decides to sit next to me. No big deal, at first. The older gentleman put his hand on my knee, and at first I thought is was an accident. I turned a little to get his hand off. He took his hand away, but then put his hand up higher on my thigh. I turned even further into the window, but the older guy apparently took that signal as ""Try to put your hand up my skirt."" I pushed it off, but he put it up higher. I jumped out of my seat and ran off the bus. I have changed my bus schedule twelve times since then. He has been on the same bus as me over and over again. I've told the police, but they haven't found out anything about him. Other than the fact that he's a stalker creep. I've been going to group an hour early every week because of that fucker. I'm not frightened anymore, I'm pissed at his audacity. I still hate being on the bus."	t5_2t3t8	True
1357416055.0	160rzf	I'm glad I changed those locks. 	love2drinktea	120	28	35	"This happened to me a few years ago when I first moved out on my own.
I had just finished my first year of university and my roommate and I,
after several failed attempts, had found an apartment in a less than
desirable neighbourhood of Toronto. The unit itself was nice, but the
surrounding buildings were mostly government housing, and the
apartment was on the second floor with an open balcony looking onto
some sketchy back parking lot. School was starting in two days and we
didn't have much more time to look around, so we reluctantly signed a
year lease.


I had only lived in the city for a year before than in residence,
(before that I lived in the suburbs) so needless to say I was less
than street-smart. I was very friendly to all the neighbours on our
floor, who were all over the age of 40 and many were single men. I
remember this one guy always had his door slightly ajar as his cat
liked to roam around the hallways and I guess he was too lazy to get
up and let her in all the time. I'd always notice him because his
apartment was across from the garbage chute and I'd see him on the
couch and he'd smile and nod. My boyfriend at the time lived in the
northern part of the city but worked downtown so he was over almost
every day and night. I was reluctant to give him a key to the unit (my
roommate and I had agreed not to make copies for our boyfriends) so I
often gave it to him on my way to work or put it in our hiding spot.
The hiding spot was next to the garbage chute, inside one of those
built-in glass cases that hold the fire extinguisher. I would slightly
lift the extinguisher and slide the key underneath. My boyfriend had
the code to our building (1-2-3-4, brilliant right?) so our little key
arrangement worked perfectly for months. He was the only person who
knew where it was, I didn't even tell my roommate.


One day I went shopping before my boyfriend got off work and didn't
feel like dropping by to give him the key, so I texted him saying it
was in our usual spot. I came back from shopping and went to open the
door to the apartment but it was still locked. I figured my boyfriend
was in the shower, so I called and got no answer. Weird. He quickly
texted back saying he was still at work, so I went to the hiding spot
to grab the key. It wasn't there.


Like I said, no one knew about this key except for us, so the only
thing I could think of was that someone had seen me hide it and taken
it. I was careful when leaving the key, never doing it while anyone
was around so the only possibility was that someone had been watching
me through the peep hole, seen me hide it and taken it after I left.
My roommate and her boyfriend had gone to visit her family in her
hometown about 5 hours away and she had obviously taken her key with
her. She wouldn't be back until Monday, so had no choice but to call
my landlord. I was afraid he would be mad that I had been hiding the
key (as I admit it wasn't the smartest idea) so I said I had lost my
entire keychain. He didn't have a spare, so he had to climb up the
side of the building onto our balcony and basically break into our
apartment. I had left the window slightly ajar but the balcony door
locked, so he had to pry it open, cut the screen and squeeze himself
in to unlock the door from the inside. Since neither of us had keys,
he had to replace the lock and gave me both copies, one for my
roommate when we came back on Monday.


That night I was feeling less than stellar, so I decided to stay in
while my boyfriend went out with some friends. At about 1 am while I
was laying in bed texting him and drifting off to sleep, I heard a key
in the door. In my half-awake state I attributed the sound to my
roommate coming home and started to drift off again when I snapped
fully awake realizing she wasn't due back for two days, and both of
the new keys to my apartment were on the kitchen counter. I freaked
out because I was just texting my boyfriend so I knew it couldn't have
been him either. I heard a few more key attempts and jiggling of the
doorhandle, but it eventually stopped. The whole time I was sitting up
in bed with our two cats, scared absolutely shitless. I wish I had
gotten up to look through the peephole but I was completely frozen
with fear. It stopped after a few minutes, and I called my boyfriend
again to make 100% sure it wasn't him. Not only had someone watched me
hide the key and then stolen it, but they had tried to break in WHILE
I was home and sleeping. To this day I have no idea who it was, but I
have a feeling it was the creepy cat guy from across the hall as his
unit was directly across from where I hid the key. I'm grateful that
nothing came of this, but I always wonder what would have happened if
my roommate wasn't away and I didn't replace the locks."	t5_2t3t8	True
1356918590.0	15p8u0	Have you ever been to jail?	jwismyqueen	120	22	14	"I've been sexually harassed several times in my life, but this is the one that has haunted me the most. 

Let me start by stating that I am a girl. I was 12 (about 5' 2'' and 100 lbs) at the time and I am now 17. A little background information: This happened at around 10:00 at night on our outdoor downtown mall. It's normally a place where families go out to eat dinner/play with their kids and that kind of stuff. It's not sketchy until after dark. Normally my parent's wouldn't let me be downtown after 9:30 but I was with three other friends (one girl, Morgan, and two boys, Drew and Colm) and we were getting picked up soon. We thought it would be cool to sit near the end of the mall and sit and talk. It was really shadowy and is kind of like an ally. That's when he walked up.

He looked homeless. He was african american with a lot of clothes on (it was summertime) and his breath reeked of alcohol. I was immediately creeped out. Why would this man in his 50's stop and talk to four 12 year old kids? 

He started making conversation, and to be polite, we indulged. It was the normal stuff, ""It's hot out, huh? yeah it's supposed to cool down later this week,"" until I noticed that he was getting closer and closer to me. He suddenly reached out and grabbed my knee, whispering, ""Have you ever been to jail?"" 

I immediately shrunk back and looked at my other friends. They were all looking back and forth from each other like the didn't know what to do. I told him no, that I hadn't. That's when he reached out to kind of grope my chest. He said, ""Well, I have. Here's some practice. I'm touching you right now. How would you respond if you were in jail?""
At that I gathered up all of the courage that I had and tried to knee him in the groin. I missed. He laughed. He told me that I was going to have to learn to fight better than that to keep people like him away from me. His eyes then sort of narrowed in and he started to get even closer. I was cornered. He kind of grasped at my pants button and that's when my friend Morgan found the courage to grab my hand and yank me away. We kept running and then she left me crying on the middle of the mall, to go get Drew and Colm. When she came back with them, I was hysterically crying. 

The boys kept saying that if he had touched me ""ONE MORE TIME"" they would have stepped in. Fucking pricks. 

I never saw him again. I never told any adults about that. We just kind of brushed it off as something that's bound to happen. But, that sort of thing shouldn't have just been ignored. He could have hurt other people for all I know. 

That's one of the scariest things that's ever happened to me. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1356883860.0	15octe	The Phantom of the Opera	pandalei	131	37	22	"This happened around 1997. This is my mum's story, but for the set up, there's a little backstory.
I was kidnapped by my father when I was four. He took me interstate. Mum called the police, but as there was no definite guardianship order, there was nothing they could do. 
They told her it would be best to remove herself so she wouldn't worry, and remove herself she did. You see, mum owned a rather successful scar treatment business, so she had some money to spare. She went to the US from Australia. San Jose. She had some friends there, and she thought it would be a decent distraction.

To the main story.

She got a job easily, working behind the bar. She had quite a few odd run-ins, but this one is the one that squicked her the most.
She used to take a certain bus home, always the same. I can see that it wouldn't have been odd for a patron to find out where she lived, and from that, her phone number.
That is, I guess, how the messages started being left. Always the same one, but over and over. Daily.
""On a hot summer's night, would your offer your throat to the thorns of a red rose?""
Occasionally he would sing Phantom Of The Opera songs. Badly.

Obviously, she was creeped out. Her then boyfriend talked her out of calling the police, and I'm not quite sure why, but she listened.
One night, a fucking horse-drawn carriage showed up at her house. A man in a cape, and a half-mask. She delicately told him to bugger off, and he did.
The messages continued, but eventually stopped.

Still, whenever she tells the story, you can see her cringe.

1356746153.0	15lqr1	I know where you live, Denise	ameliaulation	119	24	17	"I was 16 at the time and my sister was 25.
I apologize for how long this is but it scared the hell out of me and I thought it would fit well here.

My family had just moved from a two family apartment building in an area that had gone a bit shitty to a nice, single family house in the same town but in a much nicer area. It was the final day of moving and my sister and I had gone back to the apartment to make sure we hadn't forgotten anything. On our way back to the new house, we stopped at a convenience store so she could pick up a pack of cigarettes and I could get a soda.

This store was one we normally avoided because it was small and kind of dirty, but it was near our new house so we stopped there. I grabbed a soda out of small cooler next to the counter while she asked for her cigarettes.

The guy behind the counter looked like a deranged version of Brian Posehn and he was looking at both of us in a way that made my skin crawl. He asked for her ID, checked it, and rang up our stuff. As he handed back my sister's ID, he smiled at her and laughed.

""Now I know where you live, Denise."" He didn't say it in a menacing way. I can remember the way he said it so perfectly. He was so calm and focused.

My sister paid for our things and we left as fast as we could. We drove back to the new house and told our parents. The only thing that calmed us down was our mom pointing out that my sister needed a new ID. We had just moved, the address on her ID was for the old, empty apartment!

A week went by and nothing happened. Denise and my parents forgot about it and we never went back to the store.

About a month or two after the incident at the store my sister was visiting a friend and my parents had decided to go on a mini vacation, leaving me alone for a few days. I always liked being home alone, but in our new house I felt a bit weird.

It was around 2am and I was laying in bed reading Youth In Revolt for the umpteenth time using this new little book light I had gotten from my mom when I heard the front door open (we have a Craftsman style house with a closed in porch so there is a screen door, the porch, and then a main door going into the house). I instantly felt weird. I hadn't heard any cars I recognize pull up in front of my house and it was very late at night.

My bedroom is upstairs, almost directly above the front door so I carefully got off my bed and shuffled my way to the top of the stairs so I could peer down through the glass panes at the top of the door. Before I got to the stairs I heard the doorknob turn. I froze, quietly hoping I had remembered to lock the door. Whoever was at the door started turning the doorknob even harder, like they were trying to pull it out of the door. Thankfully, the door was locked.

I looked down the stairs and the only light that was on in the entire house was the exterior porch light. It was the guy from the convenience store. I started crying and shaking. I needed my phone but I couldn't find it in the darkness and I didn't want to make any sound or turn a light on to signal that anyone was home. I stood frozen in the darkness as this guy tried to look into my house. I watched him give up and leave my porch, so I ran to my window to look outside. He got into his car and drove away.

I called my parents and sister. One of them called my four male cousins who rushed over to the house and sat with me until my parents and sister got home.

I was freaking out. How did he get our new address? Turns out he had gone to our old apartment looking for me and my sister, realized we didn't live there anymore and asked the neighbor who lived above us where we had moved to telling them he was a friend that had gone to school with my sister.

We didn't call the police. A few weeks after that he was arrested for asking underage teenage girls to show him their boobs for cigarettes. I think he's in jail but I'm not sure.

It was a cottage and was a cool place. Well one night I decide to sleep over. After 12 o clock, when we finished watching The Cosby Show and M A S H, we decided to seek out. It was stupid but we still did it. Well we just roamed around for a while when we were approached by an old man who was possibily homeless. Anyways, the man offers us a couple of cigarettes and we say no. After a while we leave and we see him stalking us. We get to our house and he was still following us. Now we slept at my friends basement which had a walkout door to the yard. Later that night, we saw the man trying to open the door. We tell my friends parents and they go to check. They said they saw nothing and to us to go to sleep. Later the next day, we left to go to the forest again and we saw a tent. We looked inside of it and it had a bunch of knives and sharp tools , and also a pack of cigarrettes. We ran back home and we never went to the forest again.

My boyfriend at the time and I were driving from Massachusetts all the way to Florida-an annoying and tiring drive. Several food/bathroom/nap stops are required to survive the trek. One of the last stops we made was in the Carolinas, at a random rest stop. It was the middle of the night, and the place was pretty empty aside from parked truckers who I assume were fast asleep. I got out of the Uhaul to use the restroom while my boyfriend smoked a cigarette. There was a man lingering in front of the restroom/vending area but I didn't think much of it; he was large, but otherwise normal looking. I heard the bathroom door open while I was peeing, but again thought nothing of it and assumed it was just another female using the restroom. As soon as I exited the stall, I saw that it wasn't. The man was standing there, blocking the exit. I think I said something lame like ""hey"" or ""huh,"" essentially out of confusion. The man said nothing and didn't move out of my way. I don't know how long we stood there, it felt like forever. I swore at him, told him to leave me alone, yelled ""Fuck off,"" etc. He remained silent, and continued blocking my exit. Eventually my boyfriend barged in, having wondered what was taking me so long. He yelled at the guy, I ran out, and we got the hell out of that rest stop.

1343213026.0	x4j7m	Big Mike	tenpins	106	15	15	"I was a Senior in high school and had decided to go to my first kegger. I had just turned 18 and was ready to party. We knew one other person for sure that was going to this party and his name was Big Mike.

I hadn't met him before, but the friends I was with knew him. We met him outside the party and he went in and got wristbands and cups for us. I hadn't been drunk before and I was giddy with excitement. We all went inside and had our first few beers. The party was getting pretty big and it was hard to find a place in line to get more beer.

Big Mike had followed us around pretty much all evening and after the fourth beer, he made it apparent that he liked me a lot. I was drunk, loose, and didn't care. I let him make out with me and feel up on me. He asked me if I wanted to go upstairs, but I said no. I was still a virgin and didn't want to lose my virginity this way. He kept persisting, but I said no. But thank God, one of my friends drank too much and we eventually just left.

Fast forward to that Monday when school started. I had been told by various people that he was asking for my phone number. I found it a bit odd he asked everyone I knew. I kept getting texts from him asking me to meet up with him at different times during the day. I would kindly say ""no thank you""  and tell him that it was a one time thing. I was in no way attracted to this guy and I felt bad by leading him on while I was drunk, but I couldn't help the way I felt. I didn't want to do anything with him.

He kept persisting. I would see him around more often at the places I would frequent at school. One day after school, I came home to find him on my porch. I had never told him where I lived and I have no idea how he found my address.

""What are you doing here?"" I asked.
""I wanted to see you and talk to you,"" he said. ""We can make this work. I really like you."" 
""No, how did you know my address? I never told you that.""

He didn't say a word. I was thoroughly creeped out. I went up to my apartment and sent him a text saying to ""please, leave me alone"".

Later that night, around 11PM, my doorbell rings.  I'm cursing to myself, hoping it didn't wake up my mom. I go out to the porch and he's there, professing his love to me. I tell him no and tell him to go away. I go back inside, and finally break down and cry. Distraught and frightened, I go to the police officer at my school the next day. The police officer told me that Big Mike had problems at home and was a very violent, angry boy. And that he'd give Mike a warning and told me that if it ever happened again, to come and tell him.

I never saw him again... until last weekend.


I'm a Sophomore in college now and I'm back home for the summer. I was out bar-hopping with my friends and I saw him sitting on a concrete slab. He walked up to me and started talking.

He told me of all the times he saw me at school and watched me from afar hanging with my friends. I was shocked but I didn't let it show on my face. After being in the bar for well over an hour, I went outside with my friends to find that he's still there. I didn't even glance at him.

And now I'm here, happy I'm going back to college in just a few short weeks. I never knew what I was getting myself into. And I never thought in my life that I might be stalked."	t5_2t3t8	True
1337824709.0	u21ww	The Real Reason I Left NYC... (x-post from r/nosleep)	GodHatesSkags	164	69	54	"I first posted this in r/nosleep and, per their recommendation, decided to post it here as well.

I recently moved back to Ohio after living about 6 months in NYC. I've given everyone the same reasons for my return: the city is loud, smelly, dirty, crowded, dangerous, all the old standbys. I've been too terrified to tell anyone the real reason I left the city, but it's reached the point that if I hold it in any longer, I'll burst. I need to tell someone and since r/nosleep always seems to keep a certain level of skepticism, I can't think of a better place. This might seem long-winded, but I have to tell everything or none of it will make sense. Just bear with me...please.

I realize how ridiculous some of this may seem as you're reading, so I've added a couple pictures here at the beginning as proof of different points so you know I'm not bullshitting you all.

I moved to NYC to pursue an acting career. It's been a lifelong dream to act for a living, one I'm still pursuing, so I decided to head to the Big Apple to see what would happen. I moved in with four classmates I had graduated with, also fellow actors, and started auditioning ([this is me and three of them around Christmas time](http://i.imgur.com/Cqvb1.jpg); the fourth was taking the picture). It started off alright, a couple little shows in some tiny theatres, but soon my savings started to dry up and I desperately needed a job. I was fortunate enough to become an elf at Macy's Santaland (Here's [me in my elf costume](http://i.imgur.com/sibh0.jpg) and [this is a pic of the 2011 Parade](http://i.imgur.com/W8SBU.jpg) with the elves pointed out as comparison). The pay was decent and I met some incredible people; one of these people was named Erica. She was great; we hit it off immediately and actually got pretty close. Not romantically (I'm engaged and she, I soon discovered, was in a relationship), but we became fantastic friends. Our lockers were also situated next to each other and we all changed in the same area, so in the mornings there wasn't much in the way of privacy. It didn't bother either of us (she was also an actor and we don't have much shame in that area) and frankly I was just thankful to be next to someone attractive.

One morning as we were changing, I glanced over and saw a massive black and blue bruise on her back. I must have been visibly shocked because she turned to me, confused, then realized what I was seeing and tried to hide it. I asked about it and she shrugged it off saying that a cyclist had clipped her as she was crossing the street. It's a plausible story in the city, but I was wary. The location of the bruise and the standard dimensions of a bike didn't quite add up. As I was thinking about it, for some reason I realized she hadn't mentioned her boyfriend in quite some time. Almost immediately, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. I wanted to ask her about it, but we had to split up for the morning meeting at that point and I didn't get a chance.

Over the next few days, she started to look worse and worse. She looked tired, pale, and the bruise wasn't getting any better. I was worried, but like an idiot I didn't confront her about it. Then one day she came in and I could tell something was very wrong. She was nervous and jumpy; EXTREMELY out of character for her. When I asked her what was wrong, she just mumbled something about a visit and left it at that. I decided to keep an eye on her for the day. We'd developed a brother-sister kind of relationship and I wanted to make sure she was okay. So when she was assigned the gatekeeper position (the elf who organizes groups to see Santa), I asked if I could be an usher (an elf who takes said groups to Santa). It was as close as I could get and I could watch easily from there, plus we could interact and I could (hopefully) cheer her up a little.

The day started great. Things were running smoothly and I even managed to get a smile from Erica. But as I was returning from escorting a group that afternoon, everything went to shit. Erica was at the gate and in front of her was this bear of a guy, probably 6'3"", muscular, and just mean looking. It was his eyes...I'll never forget those eyes as long as I live. Erica and this guy were talking and he looked pissed. He started to raise his voice and she clearly needed help, so I ran up and said something along the lines of ""Is everything okay up here?"" as nicely as I could. I put my hand on Erica's shoulder as a gesture of support at that point. I guess it made something in this psycho snap because the next thing I knew he had shoved Erica into the trees we had setup nearby, grabbed me by the throat, and bull-rushed me into the nearest wall. I'm not a small guy, but this guy...he was unbelievably strong. Thank God the managers (both big guys themselves) were close at the time; I have no doubt this guy would have killed me right then and there if they and a couple coworkers hadn't pried him off.

I collapsed, coughing, as they dragged him away and called security. He was screaming things like ""Don't you touch her, you son of a bitch! I'll fucking KILL YOU!"" As soon as my head started to clear, I connected the dots: HE was Erica's boyfriend. The visit she mumbled about earlier had been him coming in. I couldn't believe it. I went and helped Erica up and we left the floor together, both moving slowly. When the managers got back, they told us the police had been called and asked if we wanted to press charges. I wanted to say yes, I SHOULD have said yes. But when I looked at her, there was this wild, primal fear in her eyes and she gave an almost imperceptible shake of her head. I spoke for both of us, saying no, that we just wanted to forget the day had happened. After a nurse looked us over, we were given the rest of the day off.

When we got to our lockers, it was as if we had already started the inevitable conversation in our heads and just continued with words. She said she was going to stay with her parents; I told her I'd get her there. We split a cab so I could keep her safe (I'd hoped) on the way to her parents' place. I gave her a hug and told her to keep in touch.

She did over the next couple days and as the Christmas season progressed she even seemed to be in better spirits. Then, one morning right around Christmas Eve, she didn't show up for work. I asked one of the managers about it and he told me, irritably, she had called the previous night and quit. He was upset she'd left us high-and-dry right before our busiest days; I was upset she hadn't told me she was quitting. I texted her to ask about it and her response concerned me. It was short, very clipped; strange for someone who was a stickler for proper grammar.

I started to get very worried. As we continued to text over the next few days, her responses kept getting more and more brief and improper. Whenever I called, there was no answer. Her Facebook posts were also getting weird, very cryptic and short. She aslso started to defriend a lot of people, mostly guys. I knew something was wrong but it didn't seem like there was anything I could do about it. I talked to a friend (who was a NYPD officer) and she told me that most likely nothing would be done even if I brought my suspicions to the police. They were just too swamped during the season and there wasn't enough solid evidence.

My concern for Erica became a primary focus for me, so much so that there were even times when I was doing things around the city and I'd swear I'd seen a brief glimpse of a hulking silhouette out of the corner of my eye. It would be gone right after I saw it every time, but it spooked me. I started telling myself it was just my mind playing tricks on me and it got to the point where I was starting to believe it. It didn't matter that I thought I was seeing things closer and closer to my apartment each day or that I was hearing from Erica less and less. It was all just a silly mind-trick, right?

I don't remember the exact date, but it was late February. I was awoken by a massive crash, the splintering of wood, a blood-curdling scream, the clatter of metal, thundering footsteps, our apartment door, then the sound of blood pounding in my ears. I slept in a loft, so by the time I got down the hallway, three of my roommates were huddled around and comforting the fourth, who was crying hysterically. Her door had been kicked open; I could see the footprint and there were splinters everywhere. Everyone else was so concerned for my roommate that they had all missed our kitchen knife laying just beyond her door. We finally got her calmed down enough to tell us what had happened. I only heard her first words: ""He was huge...and those eyes..."" I turned and ran to the window. The police were arriving; I guess someone in the building had called them after all the noise. I noticed one of the officers talking to someone on the street. He was huge, maybe 6'3"" or so. He turned and pointed to our window as if to point out our apartment to the officer. But he wasn't pointing at our window. He was pointing at me. I know because those eyes...they stared right at me. And for the briefest of moments...he smiled.

All I could do was thank God he didn't know my room was the last one in the hallway and that for some reason, the shock of finding someone else had scared him out of the apartment.

I was on the phone with my parents 30 seconds later, asking if I could move in for awhile. After that, I texted Erica and started posting on Facebook and Twitter that I was moving back to Ohio. I didn't give any details, but I wanted to make sure that this psycopath knew so that he'd leave my roommates alone. The next day I was throwing everything I owned into a Uhaul. I spent the last of my money renting that truck and giving my roommate cash to fix her door. But I didn't care. I had to get out.

I haven't heard from Erica in weeks, but at least my roommates have been left alone and haven't seen the man since that night...but there are still nights I wake up gasping for air or convinced those eyes are staring at me from a freshly kicked-in door. There are even times around town that I'm convinced I see the silhouette of a hulking figure out of the corner of my eye. But that's probably just residual stress. Just a silly mind-trick...

1336278396.0	t9b3q	Kitty &amp; the Douchebag	qlstrange	111	16	15	"When I found this subreddit and read a few of the stories, I immediately thought back to my friend Kitty and her fucked up family, and how I figured out just how acutely fucked up it was.

**Disclaimer:** Kitty is not her real name, and Ron is not her father's real name. The neighborhood we grew up in was pretty tight-knit, so just in case...

When I was three, we moved about twenty miles away from a townhouse into a two-bedroom house in the suburbs, so the house was my childhood home as far as I remember it. Myself and three other girls made up a band of misfits; we all lived within a mile of each other within the neighborhood and regularly went exploring and got into trouble. One of the girls' names was Kitty.

Kitty lived about fifteen minutes away on foot with her parents and little brother. While I was close with all the girls, Kitty and I were arguably the closest, especially before the puberty mark. We would call each other, visit each other, and spend holidays with each other. Kitty spent a *lot* of time at my house, would always beg to sleep over, stay for dinner, et cetera. It didn't occur to my stupid prepubescent brain at the time, but I didn't understand why until one night when I was about 12 or 13.

I called Kitty to ask if she wanted to hang out, but her father, Ron, picked up. I wasn't very well-acquainted with Ron, as he worked afternoons/early evenings. I don't remember the exact conversation, but it went something like this:

""Hello?"" he asked, slurring like he was drunk.

""Hi, Mr. Smith. Can I please talk to Kitty?""

A pause. A cough. ""Whoozis?""

We didn't know each other very well, as I said, but I found it pretty strange that he didn't even recognize my voice. ""It's qlstrange... from down the street?""

Another pause. ""You..."" And then he broke down sobbing. It was the pitiable, throaty wail of a full-grown man bawling like a baby. I was floored. Up till then Ron had always been this stoic, swarthy character who showed little to no emotion.

""Mr. Smith? Are you okay?""

More sobbing. Then he hung up.

I was spooked. I knew Kitty was home and that her mom was not (unlike Ron, I knew and liked her mother, and knew that she was away for the week on business). And since Ron was obviously pretty much checked out, I went to my own mom and told her everything. She called Kitty's house, but as soon as it was answered I heard someone shout at her through the phone. Then she hung up the phone.

We went down to Kitty's house together. We pounded on the door, but got no response. It was locked, to boot. My mom pulled out her cell phone to call the police, but this was in the early 2000's, so cell phones were still pretty shitty and she had to walk out into the street to get reception, about 20 yards away. I stepped onto the sidewalk and looked up at Kitty's bedroom window.

And then I saw her, screaming and flailing her arms frantically. I couldn't hear her or the pounding on the window, but when she got my attention, she started pointing around the side of the house. I knew there was a back door, and with my stupid twelve-year-old brain on autopilot, I ran around the side of the house. My mom didn't notice for a while, and I went around to the back, went up the porch steps, and tried the back door that led into the kitchen.

I didn't hear anything. ""Kitty?"" No answer. I went further, through the kitchen, down the hall, and to the base of the steps. ""Kitty?"" I said again, and this time I heard responsive pounding on a door upstairs. I hurried up the steps and to her room. By now I could hear my mom (probably having realized I was gone) pounding on the door even harder and screaming my name. I remember hesitating a moment. I didn't want to scare my mom but I also didn't want to leave Kitty. I told myself I'd get Kitty and her brother and leave straight away.

I made it to the top hall and saw that both bedroom doors were blocked off with chairs beneath the handles. I pulled them both away and pulled Kitty's door open first.

""He's acting crazy, I don't know what happened,"" I remember she said to me. ""Come on.""

So we grabbed her little brother, who was also very spooked, and ran back to the steps. We were halfway down when we heard Ron shout ""HEY!""

We turned around and see Ron at the top of the steps, HOLDING A FUCKING BLOODY KITCHEN KNIFE. He was bleeding out the arms and swaying like he was either drunk or going to pass out (possibly both).

I freaked the fuck out, didn't wait for an explanation, high-tailed it out the front door into my mother's waiting arms. Ron did not emerge from the house. The police arrived soon.

Apparently the police found him passed out from blood loss and before long he was being rushed to the hospital. Kitty's mom came back from her business trip early, and you bet your ass Kitty and her brother stayed at my house until she arrived.

**TL;DR** Friend's fucked up father locks her and her brother in her room, tries to kill himself, I manage to get them out. Shit's fucked up."	t5_2t3t8	True
1331478586.0	qrjty	[MY] stalker with a (little girl) voice modulator	shayla-shayla	126	31	22	"So I don't really like telling this story because it just seems so unreal to me that it even happened. 

I moved to Japan a few years ago for school, and I was getting along fine- got a cheap cell phone and a tiny apartment in a secluded part of Tokyo. I didn't really have any close friends so I spent a lot of time alone, which I liked very much.

So one day I noticed that I had missed SEVEN calls. Did I mention that I had just gotten there and had no friends??? I tried calling the number back, and the person picked up then hung up right away. So I tried to ignore it and BAM rings again - I pick up and it's a little girl on the phone. Or at least, it sounds like one so at first I thought she had dialed wrong and was trying to get her grandfather or something .... and was sort of friendly until she said my name. and my country of origin. and i was so fucking green that I just kept asking her who she was and why she was calling instead of just hanging up. I never corroborated anything she said, because I thought she was legit- like someone from the school?? I was stupid...

But I had been teaching little kids and there was something weird about the way she talked. 

I know it sounds weird, but she talked like a man. I can't explain it, but she talked like a man...her cadence and choice of words wasn't like a kid at all. ...

She said she was friends with 'Sally' . 'Who the f is Sally?? ' I thought. 

She asked me where I live in [neighborhood I lived in]. If I was married. What time I go home very night. 

Keep in mind this was all in Japanese and at the time I could not speak well, and could barely understand. Let alone be clever enough to trick them into giving something away. 

I hung up. They called back. They would call me 15-20+ times a day. I dreaded looking at my phone. Sometimes it was the 'little girl' and sometimes just breathing. 

I didn't have curtains on my windows, I lived on the 1st floor in a tiny, shoebox apartment. I didn't have anyone to call to say ' hey can you come over? I may have been followed home and I don't feel safe.' 

It really sucked. 

On my way home every day I would duck into shops, take different routes home.....turn corners really fast and look to make sure no one was following. 

I trusted NO ONE. CUT EYE FOR ALL! WTF ARE YOU LOOKING AT kind of thing :/

And still the phone would ring and ring. They were calling from two phone numbers. 

So I went to the police, and they told me that they couldn't do anything like call him because ' if he was to murder me, then the police would be to blame'. Yay, thanks! They just took me to the cell phone shop and showed me how to record conversations ( like I was going to fucking pick up the phone???) and how to block the numbers. 

I blocked them and the calls stopped, but I still didn't feel safe. I was still scared every day ....and the fear turned to rage. RAAAAAAAGE!

So one day while washing cabbages in my kitchen I was looking out the window, wondering if someone was looking in and I SNAPPED.

I called one of the numbers and an Indian man picked up. 

me: ' why the fuck have you been calling me ?'
him :' I haven't been calling youuuu '
me :' did you give my number to somebody? '
him: ' no, of course not.'
me: 'then you have been calling me'
him: ' no, I swe-'
ME: 'I AM NOT STUPID I KNOW IT WAS YOU. SHUT UP AND LISTEN I AM ONLY GOING TO SAY THIS ONCE * insert the most horrible things I have ever and will ever say to a person ever * YOU WILL NEVER EVEN THINK ABOUT ME AGAIN OR I WILL FIND YOU AND CUT YOUR '()'&amp;% OFF. DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
him: 'ah..bu-'
Me: ' COME TO ME THEN I FUCKING DARE YOU TRY TO COME TO ME I WILL BE READY WAITING FOR YOU AND SHOW YOU THAT YOU MESSED WITH THE WRONG CHICK. I DARE YOU. JUST FUCKING TRY IT YOU * insert terrible mean things I can't even remember* 'ARE YOU LISTENING DO YOU UNDERSTAND YOU STUPID *profanity*?'
me: 'DO YOU UNDERSTAND?'
him: '...ok...'

*click*

and I had adrenaline flavoured cabbage soup and that was the end of it.

1330451983.0	q9y3e	Hey, check out my car!	schuppaloop	112	18	15	"I grew up in a very safe neighborhood. The kind of neighborhood where I could leave my bike outside and no one would take it. It was suburban, upper-class St. Louis. The kids from my neighborhood would play outside all day, wander wherever and explore, all without worry from our stay-at-home-moms.

I was probably 8 or 9 when this story happened. It was a lazy summer Sunday afternoon. Traffic in our suburb was slow, and my brother, friends and I were looking for something to do.

""Hey, let's make a lemonade stand!"" That's what we did. We got cups, little kiddy tables and lemonade mix, and set up on my driveway right by a semi-major suburban street.

I'm going to go on a tangent here - I've always been an ""intelligent"" kid, but I was never very smart. I was extremely gullible and never suspicious of anything - to the point where kids in my school would often tell me crazy stories just because it was funny that I'd believe them.

Anyway, back to the lemonade stand. We were set up, and the money was flowing in. Seriously. The few people going for walks and passing cars would stop and give us $1, $2, $5, even $10 for our $.25 cups of lemonade.

This is where the story gets interesting. My friends had just gone into my house to make more lemonade, leaving just me and my big brother. This guy comes up in this cool, red coupe. I remember it. Black rag top. Just a cool car to look at for a little kid. He parks the car right next to our lemonade stand and gets out. I remember thinking it was weird - there was a side street like 20 feet down he could have parked on, and he wouldn't have been in the way of traffic. (And remember, for me to think something was odd or off, it really had to be unusual.)

This guys walks up to us and buys a lemonade. Gives us $5. And begins to chat with us. It wasn't the typical ""thanks for the lemonade, it's great!"" chat that we'd been getting. The guy, with sunglasses and greasy, slicked-back hair said ""hey, do you like my shoes?"" ""My friends make fun of me, they say I'm too old to have these shoes. Do you like em?""

I was a pretty shy kid, but I told him I did like them. It's true. They were cool. They were bright yellow and purple. They looked like something I might have worn, except for big kids (adults). We talked about his shoes and his car (he was leading the conversation - I didn't have too much to say.) I remember thinking that my brother was being kind of rude to the guy. My big brother is usually talkative, but he was just kind of staring at him. He usually had a great sense of when something was wrong or off, which was good, because I possessed no such ability.

As soon as he starts talking about his car, I guess my brother NOPE'd. My bro asked me to go inside and help with the lemonade. As soon as I was about 40 ft. away from the guy, my brother told the guy he'd be right back and booked it inside.

My friends were already coming back out at this point. They joined me and I went unknowingly back to my conversation with the creep. He wanted to show me some stuff on his car. It was really cool stuff, he said. Well, we were walking up to his car when I hear my mom yelling at me. Not screaming, not overly frightened, but there was this urgency in it. She wanted me to come talk to her. I turned around and began to walk towards her.

The guy hears her, looks at her, then back at me. He quickly gets in his red coupe, peels out, and speeds away. I don't know if he was going to take me, or was just a weirdo that wanted me to check out his car. One thing is for certain, though. He knew what he was doing was wrong, because when he saw my mom coming towards us, he got the hell out of there. I'm so glad that my big brother was there to look out for me.

We ended up making $80 that day. After that situation, my mom had to have some serious talks with me about strangers. We never had another lemonade stand. I never saw the guy again."	t5_2t3t8	True
1329108292.0	pn1jo	My girl friends and I were kinda dumb teens...	gabrielle1106	114	23	35	"When my friends and I were younger (14/15), we didn't have cars and we weren't quite at the age of partying and drinking... so like most young, bored teens, we just kinda hung around and did whatever. 

One of our favorite modes of entertainment was walking around in the middle of the night. My friend's mom worked night shift at the hospital, and her dad was in bed by 9, so we always had the whole night to ourselves to do whatever we wanted. Our usual walk around the neighborhood would take us down the private road, through a golf course, and back. 

One of these nights, we're on our way back from one of our usual treks. It's must have been about 1 am, so no one was outside, and the street was dark and quiet.

A truck drives down the road towards us and passes us. At first I don't think much of it, but for some instinctual reason, I was on high alert. I'm listening to the car drive away behind us, when I suddenly notice that the truck has stopped. 

I look behind and motion for my friends that the truck has stopped. We immediately begin running. As we're running, we hear a man's deep voice scream ""You girls get back here!"" The truck door slams shut and we hear tire screeches as it makes a fast 3 point turn. 

We hide behind some bushes while my friend dials 911. We watch the truck speed past the house whose bushes we're hiding in, and as soon as the truck passes, I start banging on the door. A man comes and lets us in, seeing how scared we are. After a few minutes, he walks us home, where a cop is waiting along with my friend's dad.

That night we got heavily reprimanded by both the cop and my friend's father. We trudged back into my friend's room where we all mutually decided it was about time to go to sleep.

Before we went to sleep, however, we took a few peeks out the window. The truck drove by a few more times in search of us, and eventually left.

1374500834.0	1it7rg	Bus station stalker	onslo25	106	14	7	"This happened to me a few days ago. I don't usually catch the bus home from work, but my car broke down and I had no choice. It was about 6pm, and I was sitting, reading and minding my own business in a quiet corner of the bus station when a man came over and sat next to me. This wouldn't necessarily have been odd, but I was on the end chair in a row of five seats, and had my arm across the chair next to mine. I had to move my arm as he sat down. He was perhaps mid fifties, with baggy, scruffy clothes on. He smelt very badly of sweat, and after a few seconds it started to make me feel sick. Then he started rubbing his hands together and mumbling to himself...""yes, yes, yes"". At that point, I got up, making out that I was checking bus times, and turned the corner of the bus station to sit in a busier area. I sat on a bench facing my bus stop, and settled down to my book once again. About five minutes later, I could see out of the corner of my eye that someone was coming over to me. I shuffled in my seat and lo and behold, it was the man again. He once again sat right next to me, and this time he was uncomfortably close. He was twitching, and still mumbling ""yes, yes..."", and the mumbling was getting louder. The bus was late now, and I started to get freaked out. There were people around, but nothing had actually happened, so I couldn't ask for help.

After a few seconds, I got up to join the queue that had started forming for my bus. The man didn't follow me, although I looked over once and I could see him looking at me. The bus pulled up, and still, the man did not move. I began to breathe a sigh of relief as I turned to board the bus, safely sandwiched between two other people. As I had my foot on the step of the bus, I heard a scuffle behind me. I turned and the man had pushed into the queue to be directly behind me. My heart started to beat faster and I began then to think that he was actually trying to follow me. I knew if I chose a seat by myself he would sit next to me, so I sat next to a woman right at the front of the bus. The man sat directly behind me, and I could hear his breathing and his murmuring. I could still smell the sweat.

I still needed to catch another bus when I got off this one, and my plan was to just run as fast as I could across town to the other bus stop, hoping he wouldn't follow, or at least wouldn't catch up. Luckily, I managed to run and get on the other bus just as it was pulling off. I didn't look behind me as I did, and maybe I was just being paranoid. Either way, I won't be catching the bus home from work again in a hurry. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1362207514.0	19igya	The Lighter Side of LNM	cincharge	104	9	27	"I posted this as a response in another thread and it was unfortunately buried, however, it's just too ludicrous to go to waste. My story is somewhat humorous though it was awful in the moment.

One summer day when I was 8 or so I was plumb bored outta my mind so I hatched a plan to create a scrapbook of neighborhood flowers. I snatched up my Mickey Mouse camera (the kind with those flash capsule things) and set out on my bike to find some tulips and shit.

Everything was going swimmingly - boredom satiated and plenty of lovely subjects. One in particular was a home that had a statuette of the Virgin Mary surrounded by rose bushes. I snapped a pic and was on my way. About 5 minutes later a black car pulled up next to me and a frumpy woman leaned out of the passenger side window.

""Excuse me? Why did you just take a picture of that house?""

I was pretty embarrassed because even at 8 years old I could grasp how pathetic it was to sightsee in your own neighborhood, but I explained my scrapbook to her.

""NO. You're *lying*. Take me to your house NOW.""

With my heart pounding in my head I rode back home with this woman and her husband following close behind in their car. I had no idea what I had done or even what she thought I did, but I was terrified that I had done the most horrible thing that could be done. I burst into my parents' house crying hysterically. They could barely get the story out of me before the woman appeared on the stoop.

My mother met her at the door and asked what had happened.

""Your daughter took a picture of MY house!""

There was a tense pause from both women.

""...and?""

""AND I want to know what you people are up to!""

""Oh, she's making a scrapbook or something.""

""BULLSHIT. You people have been spying on me since I moved in a week ago and I WANT TO KNOW WHY.""

My mother laughed and tried to explain that appraisers and the like often photograph homes that have been recently purchased, but this crazy bitch was having none of it. It escalated from there, particularly due to this woman's repeated use of the phrase ""you people"" as though we were part of an undercover home photography organization. My mother screamed at her to leave our property, at which point the woman declared that she's was calling the police.

""*YOU'RE* calling the police?! *I'M* calling the police!""

My mom got to the fuzz first. They arrived promptly given her complaints of ""an insane woman harassing her daughter"" (a flair for the dramatic I may or may not have inherited). After speaking with the woman, the police made her apologize, but they also made me hug her which was the worst.

To this day I can't get over the fact that they hopped in their car to stalk me, nor can I fathom what they thought the 8 year old with the Mickey Mouse camera was a cover for."	t5_2t3t8	True

Here are just a few more things that happened that I can remember. 

She went to the doctor another time while I was in Rogers, Ar. I was visiting friends and got a phone call from her saying a nurse put a bubble in her vein. I didn't really understand at first and she explained that they were testing her blood that day. She said the nurse accidentally pushed the syringe and put a bubble of air in her vein and that it can kill you. I freaked out. Oddly enough, she survived that. 

This one you will probably laugh at me for. The friend ""Allysa"" had been texting me late at night telling me that she though Meggan was ""special"". She said she thought Meggan was some kind of angel or some crap. I dunno but I honestly fell for it a little. I didn't think she was actually an angel but I thought maybe there was something special about her. She's specially fucking crazy. 

The other people that she had made up on the internet. The girl that hardly contacted me at all...her picture was just like all the other ones. It was really ""emo"" like or whatever. Dark, mysterious, and grungy looking. I saw another profile with the same picture. I went through this profile and you could tell they were all the same girl. I went to the other one and started looking and she only had one or two. I wrote the girl who had a bunch of pictures and asked if it was really her. She said yes and told me that she would send me one on email if I didn't believe her. That helped with putting all the pieces together also. 

I found out about another ex of hers and I went to meet him after all this crazy stuff went down. He was a twin and I talked to him, Jace, and his brother, Dakota. I found out she had done some crazy stuff to him too and still had been trying when she and I were together but I never knew. I ended up getting to know them both very well and dated Dakota. He was pretty awesome too. :) 

I finally remember the name of the person she was supposed to go camping with. His name is Mac. He actually helped me find Jace and Dakota. 

Okay! So after all this is said and done..she writes me on facebook. She has a new last name. Meggan Hattingly (I think I spelled it right). Told me that the day she left on the plane she met a guy that she fell in love with immediately. They apparently got married shortly after and had a daughter. He is in the army I guess. Then she apologized and that's when I got my beloved necklace back. I told her I forgave her and it was in the past. I had just gotten back from Afghanistan and I wasn't really in the mood for it. 

I had the same phone number for over 5 1/2 years. She started texting me and asking me things about court martials and jag. They are military terms. I don't know too much about them but I tried to help her the best I could. I am a cop but what happens to people after they are arrested is for higher ranking to deal with. Not much crime happens at my base. 

She tells me her husband has been beating her and she's scared for her life and her daughters...she won't leave me alone. These texts go on and on for about 3 months and I keep trying to help. I finally tell my boyfriend what happened with this girl and while we are out one night he grabs my phone and texts her telling her that she needs to leave me alone and that I want nothing to do with her. I haven't spoken to her since. That's about it. 

I know it's not ultra creepy but...I thought you might find it interesting. 

Holy shit! Here is my old myspace. I can't remember the log in info but here is a link to a video of she and I singing. She isn't very pretty...don't judge me. She is the girl in the passenger seat.

I sat down near an old man (probably around 70 or 80). We start talking and he's telling me about his days as a judge when he was younger. He was really nice and we ended up talking for a while, probably 2 hours. 
Then out of nowhere, he starts hitting on me hard (I'm a guy). Nothing about our conversation up to this point indicated that it take such a turn. He starts trying to get me to come back his place, offering money and such. I was very flattered but a little creeped out. When I say he was hitting on he hard, I mean that his exact words were ""I want to enjoy your cum."" 
I made it clear to him that his advances were not welcome and that I was not interested. Once he finally left, the bartender apologized for not warning me about him. I later talked to other people around town about this and it turns out he's a local character that is known for this type of behavior. 

A bartender at another bar told me about his encounter with the man, which is more funny than creepy. If anyone is interested, I can tell that story as well. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1351190962.0	122vix	The things I do to get sold out convention tickets...	kyndle	139	45	78	"When I first went to college, I joined a Facebook group for World of Warcraft players in Massachusetts. None of my friends were really into the game (I'm a girl, girls don't play games) and I wanted to find other people to play with. Got a message from some guy named Chris, a typical nerdy-looking dude (sorry to stereotype), glasses, very very short hair (almost bald), probably a little under 300 pounds. He started liking ALL my facebook photos, and commenting flirty yet creepy stuff on my profile pics like ""what a cutie"", ""i'd love to cuddle with you"", etc, which caused my family and friends to be like ""Um, who is this."" Eventually he stopped and I forgot about him, so I never got around to deleting him off my friends list.

Anyway, so that's the backstory. About a year later, (2009 I think), PAX East (a gaming convention held annually in Boston) was coming up and I waited til the last minute to get tickets. Everything was sold out, couldn't find a ticket to save my life. So, I posted on Facebook, ""Hey, anyone have an extra PAX ticket?"" Sure enough, Chris commented on it saying he had one. I was super excited, sent him a message asking if he could mail it to me. Instead he was like, ""No, lets hang out! I'll take you to dinner and I'll give it to you then"".

Now, for some reason I didn't consider any meeting-stranger-from-the-internet precautions. I was so desperate to go to this convention that I was like, fuck it! I gave my friends the guy's name, phone number, and Facebook, just in case something went wrong. And I made sure the place he took me to for dinner was very close by.

So, that Friday, he picked me up at my dorm. When I walked out, he got out of the car and hugged me and opened the door for me... which is fine, I can dig that I guess... It wasn't until we were waiting in line to get food (we went to a burrito place) when he puts his arm around me. And I was just like, umm... and didn't know how to react (I am a total socially awkward penguin more often than not). Suddenly, Chris puts his arm down, turns to the guy behind us, and yells ""What do you think you are doing? Are you looking at this girl's ass? This is my girlfriend, NOT yours"" and then SLAPPED my ass.

I was fucking horrorstruck. But I still hadn't received the stupid ticket. I could tell this guy wasn't a crazy serial killer, just a very lonely man. I apologized to the guy behind us and told Chris not to slap my ass ever again, and that I wasn't his girlfriend. After we ate, on the ride home, we almost got into a car accident (for some reason I almost feel like it was on purpose, I could be totally wrong, but someting seemed off) and I was so ready to be rid of this guy. (Yes, I am going to hell, deal with it). By this point I had the ticket in my purse. Suddenly his hand is on my leg at a red light. What. The. Fuck. I looked at him and was like, please don't touch me, we are not romantically involved.

When we got to my dorm, he was like ""I brought some DVD's, do you want to cuddle and watch some of them?"" I said no, sorry, I have homework, goodbye. Opened the car door. ""But wait. Please. Let me come in."" Again I said, no, sorry, I really need to get some stuff done. ""Well, okay, I'll come in and help you"". Then he starts parking the car. Eventually I just jumped out of the car and ran up to my dorm, closing the door behind me, running into my friends room (which was adjacent to the front door of the building), closing THAT door behind me, locking it, and curling into fetal position on their futon.

The guy texted me several times over the next week (very angry, depressing texts) but I ignored all of them, blocked him from Facebook, and never heard from him again.

1349897634.0	119ni6	Dating the Stalkee...	Draulable	124	32	31	"I went to Key Largo with my student government association for a retreat. I was interested in a girl named Pryn who I had met the week before and we had seemed to hit it off pretty well. After the entire day was spent on Robert's Rules of Order and leadership training, we were allowed to go hang around the resort and do whatever we wanted. Everyone pretty much hung out at the pool the entire day and it was a great time.

By the end of the night, all of the students had either gone to their rooms, the bar, or the other part of the resort to play billiards. Pryn and I were still by the hot tub and things had a gotten hot and heavy, and I don't mean the water. She had started off by massaging my back and then we ended up making out furiously. Our hands were all over each other and we hungrily attacked each others mouths like it was our last minute on Earth.

After several minutes of making out, we are interrupted by one of the hotel workers telling us that the hot tub would be closing but we could still go into the pool if we wanted. We made our way to the pool where there were still a few people left. We calmed down until we were alone again. I was carrying her around in the water, feeling her up the whole time. Everyone realized that we were being awfully close but we didn't care. The attraction was there and we were having a great time. Then finally we were alone..or so we thought.

As I am kissing her again, I feel her body tense up and she pulls away. I am obviously wondering why. She comes up to my ear and whispers to me that we are being watched. I get some chills right away and I ask her what she means. She tells me that one of my fellow student government members named Blunder was glaring at us while we were making out. Blunder is president of the scuba club and had been obsessed with Pryn since she had showed some interest in the scuba club during her freshmen orientation. By obsessed, I mean he was literally texting her at all times of the day and night despite her being several thousand miles away in New York before she came to Florida for college. He would show up in places where Pryn was without invitation. He had actually crashed one of my parties but I didn't realize until it was already over. He blew up her Facebook page with posts, commented on everything from statuses to pictures from years back, and was rude to any male that commented on her page. She unfriended him but mostly everyone knew that he was a nut job. 

This had reached the ears of our student government and the general consensus was that Blunder was a strange dude. He was only in student government because we needed a non-traditional student to represent those who were not between 18-22 years old. I think Blunder was 28 and Pryn was 18. I turn around and I see Blunder is sitting on a pool chair with a small towel over his head staring straight ahead at us. She told me everything I relayed to you here and she asks me if we should continue down by the beach. I said no, I grabbed her, and we made out right in front of Blunder. I didn't care that he was there, he had to learn his place.

Blunder didn't take this well. From across the pool we could hear growling, snarling, and deep, uncontrolled breathing like a panic attack or asthma. Blunder's was rocking back and forth on the pool chair and the towel had fallen off his head to reveal the crazed look in his eyes. That's when I stopped being brave and realized this guy might be a problem. As we swam towards the other end of the pool, Blunder screamed and jumped into the pool. He was thrashing against the water like a mad man but he was swimming like Michael Phelps. Pryn and I swam to the ledge and pulled ourselves out of the water. We high tailed it out of there and went to my room. We called our adviser over the room phone and told her what happened. Unfortunately, she couldn't do anything about it since he didn't hurt us and she didn't want to deal with anything happening away from the school since she didn't want to cause an incident.

I saw her reasoning and we decided to wait until we returned to school the next day to do something about it. The following day, Blunder walks up to me and confronts me about hooking up with Pyrn. He basically tells me that they are boyfriend and girlfriend and that it was a dick move of me to make out with her in front of him. I simply shake my head and nod and tell him he was right and I would stay away from her. I felt like I was talking to a time bomb. He tells me that we are cool and walks away. I tell Pryn what happened and she gets upset about it. I tell her that once we get back to the school, we can go have something done about him. We left Key Largo that day and we returned to the school.

We went to Public Safety and they said they would take care of it. We find out that Blunder had gotten a warning that if either Pyrn or I complained about him again, he would be kicked out of school for harassment. Other students, specifically females, had complained about him being inappropriate in the past before. We never heard from him outside of student government meetings in which he would constantly scream, rant, and make irrational arguments against whatever was being discussed. Whenever, Pyrn or I would present a bill, he would instantly be against it and scream us down. Eventually Blunder was kicked off campus for harassing another girl who reported him to the campus police. 

Edit: Removed reference to sexual areas. I don't recall his name for the life of me at the moment so I will continue to call him Blunder.

1348299325.0	10ag80	Beaten black and blue	Smidget30	121	26	28	"This is my first real submission, although I've been lurking on the subreddit for about a month or so now. Please be kind!:)

 This isn't a spooky sort of story, per sey, more of a bad memory/cautionary tale. It takes place in the mid 80's, when I was a preschooler in Alabama. 
  My parents were both DJ's at a local Christian radio station in Birmingham at that time and my sister was a kindergardener, so my parents were in need of childcare for me, as I was four and not yet in school. They really couldn't afford much in the way of a sitter, so they hired someone they thought they could trust, the teenaged daughter of a coworker. I believe her name was Shaniqua, and I don't remember much about her except she scared me. And rightly so.

  I'm grateful our brains have good coping mechanisms that we can't even control, because I don't remember any of the events really leading up to this revelation. I'm certain my brain has blocked all those memories, but I remember this moment in time crystal clear, surprising for my age at the time.
   I remember it was nighttime, bath time before bed. My mother was downstairs on the phone, my sister had already had her bath, so it was my turn. My dad had run the water, tested it to be sure it was the right temperature, and I was standing in the bathroom wrapped in what seemed to be a huge bath towel while I waited for him to give me the ""ok"" to get in the tub. (In reality, it was probably just a regular sized towel, but to my four year old self it seemed the size of a bed sheet.)
  My loving dad finished running the water, turned it off, and proceeded to tell me to hop in the tub. I was a silly little girl and thought it would be funny to get in and shake my booty at my dad, because what kid doesn't think booty-shaking isn't hilarious? I clearly remember the mood suddenly get very still and heavy, then I heard my dad tell me to get out of the tub. He was so serious, I was certain I had done something wrong, maybe my booty-shaking had made him mad? I was just trying to be silly! I didn't mean to get into trouble! But I obeyed and as I got out of the tub, he gently wrapped me in my towel, reassured me I had done nothing wrong, but I needed to go downstairs to my momma. I was so confused, I had no clue what was going on, but since I knew I wasn't in trouble yet my dad was so graven, something bad had happened. 
  
  I went downstairs to my momma to wait for her to get off the phone and to hear what my dad had to tell her, while he stood there with his hands gently placed on my shoulders. My mom could tell by the serious look on his face and the confused look on my face that something was terribly wrong. She asked the person on the other end of the line to hold on, covered the mouth piece, and waited for my dad to explain what this turn of events meant. 

  He gently told me to turn around while he unwrapped me from my towel, with my backside facing my mother. I heard her gasp, tell the person on the end of the line she needed to go, and then silence. She didn't say anything for what seemed like a long long time. Then she asked my dad what happened. He had no idea. They asked me what had happened, who had done this to me? I had no idea what they were talking about, I was just as confused as they were. Then they told me. My whole backside, especially my bottom, was completely black and blue. Someone had beaten a four year old little girl black and blue. 

  After some discussion as to how this could have happened, who could have done this, they realized it was the baby sitter. She had taken it upon herself to ""punish"" me when I wasn't doing what she thought I should or doing what she deemed ""bad"". 

 I can recall very few times seeing my father that angry. Angry enough that he had no words. Just raw fury. My mother, however had PLENTY of words. And all of them directed at babysitter and her mother. To this day, I don't know what she said to her, but I do know that Shaniqua never watched me again. And I cannot recall if I ever saw that family again. I know my parents didn't press charges, but I also know they became VERY VERY vigilant when it came to someone watching their children! 

  Only just a year or so ago, my sister and I talked about that period of time when Shaniqua was our baby sitter (she was mostly mine, but would watch my sister when she came home from kindergarden). I told my sister I can hardly remember any of the times she watched us and I remember my sister going slightly pale and telling me, ""I can."" I asked her if she was ever punished by Shaniqua like how I was, and my sister told me this exaclty, ""No, she never beat me. But I remember when she would beat you. I remember her taking you in the back room. And I remember hearing the wooded spoon hitting your butt. And your crying. And I'm sorry I never stood up for you. I'm so sorry."" "	t5_2t3t8	True
1345162102.0	ycl0i	Why not just give the peeping tom a lift home, eh?	hippityhopp	112	18	8	"YO! Been watching this place for ages, this is my first post blah blah blaaah etc. Let’s get to it…

This story took place about 5 years ago when I was 16 and lived in my old house at the bottom of a cul-de-sac. Around twilight I was in my bedroom which looked out onto the back garden, shamelessly towelling myself dry after a shower with the curtains open, as was per usual. My garden was pretty much totally enclosed with big high hedges round the perimeter so I never really considered that someone might see me.

I had finished drying my body and was going to use my towel as a turban for my hair. You know when you bend forward, wrap it round, twist and then fling your head back? Yeah, well I was just whipping my head up when he caught my eye. There was a guy crouching in the bushes outside staring straight at me. It felt like I stopped for a number of seconds staring back but in reality I think I was actually quite smooth about it, even though it felt like I’d had all the wind knocked out of me. In one continuous movement I flung my head up, turned around and headed straight out my door into the hall way. Naked. With my whole family at home.

I ripped the turban off my head and wrapped it round myself as I walked towards the living room that looked out to the front garden. My parents and (older) brother were there watching TV and just as I started to say, “There’s a man-“ my brother saw the guy running out of the front garden and up the cul-de-sac. My brother and dad, presumably thinking it was someone trying their luck at our car or maybe the garage, bolted outside and caught up with him at the top of the cul-de-sac. My mum and I went to the window trying to read the body language and see what was going on and I told her he was watching me get changed. I could now get a proper look at the guy- he was pretty young, early twenties or maybe even late teens and looked positively petrified.

After a few minutes the three of them walked back down towards my house and I quickly ran back to my room to shove on some clothes. I came back into the hallway as my brother came in the front door telling my mum, “It’s just some kid. Says he was chased by some guys from the park and had to take a short cut through our garden. The garage is open but it didn’t look like he had anything on him, it’s all good.”

“Bollocks!” I said. “He was watching me get changed. He was hiding in the bushes!!!”

My mum looked worried and my brother looked kind of shocked/ amused and told us that dad was giving the guy a lift home. I couldn’t believe my dad bought his story especially since if you were running away from the park, our garden would be a pretty obscure escape route. My dad came home about 10 minutes later and after telling him what really happened he said he wasn’t surprised. Apparently my dad thought it was a lie but insisted he give him a lift home to protect him from the “guys chasing him” meaning he’d find out where he lived and he wouldn’t have the balls to come back. Pretty clever actually but definitely not how I would have handled the situation.

He never did come back... But I do now shut my curtains when I’m changing. Always.

1344809699.0	y41fn	I was never too worried, but this is for sure the weirdest thing that has ever happened to me.	DerripGGG	107	15	18	"I will always think of this as the strangest thing that has ever happened to me. I just read a post on here a girl wrote about some creepy guy on a bus and I have a similar story, except I'm a male. This happened when I was a Sophomore in high school, which was in 2006. I didn't have my license yet so I had to ride the local public bus to and from school. I saw some pretty interesting things on the bus, mainly fights and homeless people vomiting, but this specific night was completely different.

I was riding the bus home a little later than usual because of a school project I was working on at my friend's house. I was about half way home when a man who had to be at least 80 years old got on the bus. He immediately stood out because he was wearing clothes that I would have expected a 13 year old skate boarding kid to wear. Also, he was wheeling an oxygen tank on a small dolly behind him. His shirt was red and covered with little black skulls, and he was wearing UFO pants, which if you don't know what those are they are just incredibly baggy pants for teenagers. I was listening to my ipod and I really didn't think anything of this guy, except he had a slightly strange appearance.

He immediately took a seat directly opposite me on the bus so we are sitting face to face. He said something to me, but I couldn't hear him so I took out my headphones and asked him what he had said. He repeated himself, asking me what I was listening to. I said I was listening to the white stripes and he was overly excited and saying that he loves bands like that. I put my headphones back in, hoping the conversation was over, but he continued. He asked me what kind of things I like to do and where I like to hang out. I just gave him some vague, stereotypical teenager answers like going to the movies and whatnot. He then asked me what I was doing tonight and that's when I got the sense that things were getting really weird. I responded saying i was headed home because I had school in the morning. He accepted that but continued to ask me if I would want to hang out with him sometime at his house. He asked me at least three times in a row, each time I kept saying "" I don't know, man. I don't think so"". I stared to get really freaked out so I pulled the buzzer to get off the bus probably 6 or so blocks early. As I got up to get off, he grabbed my arm and pulled my face close to his and he looked me in the eyes and said, ""I can get you off really, really well."" I was just absolutely shocked. My thoughts were just a complete mess and I was just so fucking taken aback. I pulled my arm away and stepped off the bus and that was the end of it.

Thinking back I should have done something awesome like punch him in his dick or something like that, but I was just in state of utter confusion. I didn't tell my parents about the incident for about 2 or 3 years just because I didn't want to freak them out over nothing. I think about what happened probably every day, and barring some crazy shit like alzheimers or horrible head injury, I will always remember this until I die.

tl;dr- crazy old man pedophile on the bus dressed like a teenager tried to get me to come back to his house to give me a blowjob."	t5_2t3t8	True

I live in a small suburban area, enough woods to make it feel creepy, but enough people and buildings to be paranoid of your neighbors. Im 16 and yet every night i like to double check my parents and make sure my doors are locked. So one night everyone in my house was passed out and i was downstairs eating and figured id do my rounds. To my surprise i see a man standing on the other side of my glass door. I opened the door just enough for our voices to travel through. He asked to come in and use my phone because his car broke down. ""your car?"" i asked, because it was no where in sight. To this he had no response. I left the door (open...fuck me right?) and i went to tell my dad about the man. we came downstairs and the man was gone and door closed. I flipped out and my dad just said the man probably left. So i went upstairs to go to sleep about a half hour after the man came. I just accepted what my father said to put my mind to ease. I coulda sworn i heard a tapping coming from my attic all night. The next day passed, football practice and beach (hard life of a high schooler during summer) The night rolled around again and i fell asleep at about 10pm, relativity early for me. 
I woke up at about 3 to get a glass of water, and right before i opened my door i heard a loud BANG come from right outside of it. It only took my seconds to realise the noise was my attic stairs being relased down. I opened my door only to see a shadow quickly shoot down the stairs. The big brave football and track star that i was took off after him. I nearly leaped down all my stairs and ran out my already open front door. As i sprinted into my lawn i could see the figure sprinting just underneath a street light in the distance and i took off right after him swearing and cursing at him the whole time. After pursing him for about 5 minutes he got into a car parked around the corner and drove right towards me. I remember it vividly. The small red Honda civic passing under the street light right towards me. I swear i could see the flash of his eyes and this chilling grin. Almost instinctively i picked up the biggest rock i could see in the woods next to me and as he neared i hurled the rock clean through the driver side window. I was pretty sure i did some good damage cause his car seemed to swerve as he drove down the street. I ran back to my house to find my dad at the table pistol in hand, asking me exactly ""what the fuck just happened here?"" i explained, we called the cops. The man was caught the next day at a hospital with a broken jaw and a few missing teeth on the left side of his face. I saw his mug shots and it scares me to this day. That could have been the last face i saw before i was taken or killed silently in the night. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1340044391.0	v8hfh	Can I touch your feet?	ladyuniscorn	111	18	13	"I was with my boyfriend at a party over the weekend. A man from across the room spots me and makes a beeline to me. I was sitting in chair next to my boyfriend chatting with a couple of people. The man walks up to me and says hello using a username from another site (where I have never shown my face or any distinguishing features).

I have no clue who this is or how he knows who I am, so I naturally have a blank look on my face trying to figure it out. When it is obvious to him that I have no idea who he is, he introduces himself by his username - still a blank look. He told me we messaged on the other site, about veganism and cafe gratitude. Then it clicked, he messaged me several times and I messaged him back once regarding vegan cooking but since he can't cook we really have nothing to talk about.

The conversation starts out normally enough, I introduce my boyfriend (again sitting right next to me) and we talk about cafe gratitude for a few minutes. He starts eyeing my legs and complimenting them, my response being thanks my boyfriend (gesture in direction of the boyfriend) and I work out together everyday. He keeps looking at my legs and compliments my shoes, again thank you. At this point he asks if he could touch me feet, give them a rub. As he starts reaching for my feet I just say, ""I'd rather not.""

He gave me this weird look, like he didn't understand why I would refuse. Shortly after my boyfriend got tired of his conversation and called me away, the guy followed me around the entire rest of the evening.

1375215209.0	1jdebx	I don't work through breaks anymore.	Camp_Koala	131	39	8	"So, I have been reading stories on here for a while,I decided I would share one of mine, because,well to me it was creepy.


Please excuse any writing errors! 


So, little bit of back story, I was 22, living in a new state,I am around 5""2, and female. Where  I worked I was generally off in the corner of the building working by myself. My shift was from 10pm to around 7am. 


It was around my first break, I decided to work through it because, I had a lot to do and didn't want to leave a lot for day shift to worry about, I noticed a guy, he was older then me,probably late 20's-early 30's had been walking around my area for a while looking around, I decided he probably needed help, I asked if I could help him find anything and he asked where the adult diapers were so I showed him and that was that.


The next day he was there at the same time, this time however, he came straight to me and started to talk, I kept working so I didn't fall behind in my work, the conversation was generally normal he was here from out  of town working he never specified for what. Then he started talking to me about of all things periods! 


 Obviously,by this point I am weirded out. I am a pretty friendly person so, I tried to change topics and finally said I needed to get something from the back,when I came back he was gone. 


Next day same deal, here he is, this time he decides to tell me he was born with both male and female,I am just standing there like, alright I don't know why that would be something I need to know about you since, I don't know you...I don't even know this guys name! Then, he asked me what stuff I use because, he ""has a heavy flow.""


About this time I excused myself to the back room to find one of my bosses,I was mainly uncomfortable with the fact that this person I don't know is telling me things that are very personal and asking me personal questions in an attempt to almost bond with me in a way. 


This went on for almost a week. I was always on the lookout for this guy so I could go to the back and not deal with him,one night though he seen me on my way to the back, I tried to loose him he followed me the whole way to the back room. 


He finally left me alone while I was working when one of the bosses finally got there to talk to him, told this guy he was making me very uncomfortable, and I had to work not socialize.


I even quit going outside to smoke because I was a little scared he'd be out there waiting. Which even after he left me alone,still scared me as the hotel he was staying at was near where I lived and I walked by myself to and from work. 


So, that's my creepy story,never seen him after that,I did however find out he was related to a co-worker,was not born with both parts,and just generally insane.

1371201828.0	1gbujb	My Neighbor, Walter White	misterfryman	119	28	19	"It was my first year having moved away from home, and I lived in a very nice apartment complex.  There was a nice blending of older people and younger people about my age.  Occasionally, you could hear one of the couples in my area of the complex banging but that was only on weekends very early in the morning.  All in all, living there was a 10/10 experience until Walter White moved in.  I call him Walter White, because he looked like Heisenberg if he hit the crystal, and because he was a criminal.  I also call him Walter White because I can't remember his name.

I live in Southern California, but it's not the part of Southern California you see on TV (although the specific city was the original setting of Breaking Bad.)  Poverty and drugs are both massive problems.  At the time I lived in a nicer area of the city, and when the guy I moved in I assumed that he was cool.  He drove a Ford Bronco that looked like shit, and was constantly working on it in the middle of the parking lot.  Some times I'd see him while coming or going or taking out the trash.  I'd smile, nod, he'd do the same.  This was the routine.  It was safe and comfortable.

One day while taking out the trash (without greeting me) he asked, ""Hey, smoke reefer?""  I was listening to music so I just smiled and booked it back to my apartment.  This happened a couple of times.  Eventually I told him no.  This did not dissuade him.  My room mate was a big straight edge.guy but I didn't say anything because I didn't want to cause problems.

People start hanging out at his apartment constantly.  They don't took clean, most of them are bros who couldn't be older than twenty.  He lived on the first floor, and had an enclosed patio that was filled with bikes (we'll get back to that later) and he started covering the windows with bed sheets.  This carries on for a few months, I try to time my trips out around him.  Eventually the property manager drops by and asks me about him, tells me that some people have had some problems and asks me if I've noticed anything weird.  Wanting to stay out of it, I just tell her that I never see him.

One night, my wife, her friend, and I park.  The parking lot is well-lit, and this guy materializes out of nowhere.  ""Hey, smoke reefer?""  My wife's idiot friend responds, ""yeahhh.""  He says, ""hold out your hand,"" and she does.  He drops what has to be a gram of mary jane into her palm.  He says, ""You know where to find me,"" and then he disappears.

Fast forward.  Mister White is having a party with what I assume is his family.  It's loud but a weekend and the middle of the day so IDGAF.  Police show up, sirens blaring.  He starts screaming, we go outside and he's in handcuffs, and the police are taking him away.  He's screaming ""You guys are fucking nazis man!  I'm just trying to support my family!  A fella has a right to support his family!""  I sigh with relief because I assume this dude is going away for a while.  I ask my property manager what happened.

The guy had threatened to kill our neighbor with a knife.  I have no idea why, when ever I saw the neighbor he was incredibly polite.  I assume that it was racially motivated because the guy was Hispanic.  This adds a delightful seething level of racism and violence beneath the gruff appearance of a drug dealer who has the ability to manifest himself at night.  Whenever I come home I sneak in and out.  I take different routes through the complex to avoid him.

A few days later, there's a knock at the door.  I answer and it's Walter.  He's leaning, his hand on my door frame.  ""Hey man,"" he says, ""how are you doing?""  I tell him I'm fine, ""How are you, Walter?"" I ask.  He says, ""I'm good.  The neighbor called the cops on me.  A guy's just trying to support his family.""  Then he starts talking about how he was in lock up because he has schizophrenia and the cops confiscated his plants.  ""Yeah,"" I respond.  ""Do you have a cigarette lighter?""  I do because at the time I have a pack a day habit (but by this time I've moved my smoking time indoors for obvious reasons).  I nod, grab one from my pocket and hand it to him.  He says, ""thanks man.""

Then he looks me dead in the eyes.  I can remember this moment.  This is what it must have been like to be a member of the Manson family.  He had some of the (cliche ahoy) bluest eyes I had ever seen, and it felt like I was falling into them.  He asks me how I'm doing, and I respond, ""I'm okay,"" and he says, ""Don't worry about your mother, man.  Mine was hard on me too, you know?  You gotta go with what you feel in your heart.  You're okay.""  I don't know what prompted this; I'm most disturbed by the fact that at the time I was at odds with my mom about some inconsequential shit and I was feeling down about it.  The minute I close the door, I think to myself that the guy has to either be some type of psychic, listening in on my apartment, or Satan come to drag me down to Hell.

Progressively, I retreat deeper and deeper into my apartment.  There's a smell coming from the guy's apartment.  It smells like metal and jizz.  More bikes are piled into his backyard.  He's brought a shed into the parking lot and has it connected to a generator.  We can hear saws and tools.  It's at this moment that I realize, ""oh, that's why he has so many bikes.  He's a bike thief and this is a chop shop.  This is what my home has become.""

This is the last straw and he's evicted.  He's not ""evicted"" evicted because of his rights as a renter and keeps paying his rent, but they keep posting eviction notices on his door.  He and his old lady keep fighting.  One day I'm coming home and he's sitting outside crying, he runs up to me and says, ""My old lady left me man, my old lady left me.  She took my silver man.  She took my mama's silver!""  He keeps going on.  I don't remember how I tactfully evaded this, but I'm pretty sure that I didn't and that I just said ""uh"" and went upstairs.  At this point I feel kind of sorry for the guy because he's clearly a mess.

Later, he's left and his ""old lady"" lives there now because her name is on the lease.  One day I'm coming home, and this kid is sitting on the steps.  He's probably like 14.  He asks me, ""Do you know a guy that lives in that apartment named Walter White?"" and I say, ""I know him, why?"" and the kid starts talking about how it's his dad.  He came by to ""kick his ass"" because of something to do with the kid's little brother.  The kid starts talking about how he's a son of a bitch.  While he's talking about what a son of a bitch his dad is, he pulls a lighter and cigarette out of his pocket and starts smoking.  The kid tells me that the dude has been in and out of psych hospitals ever since he (the kid) was born.  I tell him that if I see Walter again, I'll tell him that he's looking for him.

Fast forward, I'm coming home and I see the window next to Walter's front door is broken.  I assume this has something to do with either the eviction, another arrest, or just a random act of violence.  I have a smoke on my patio, and I hear Walter's ""old lady"" come home. Then I hear her scream and she doesn't stop.  Of course, I call the police.

They show up, I sit on my porch, listening.  His ""old lady"" is crying, ""don't take him away!"" and he's screaming about how they're nazis.  By this point, I've made the decision to move and only have about two weeks left in that apartment.  I'm between semesters so I make the decision not to go outside unless I know for sure that guy isn't there.  

On my last day at the apartment, I grab lunch before my wife and I leave for our new place.  I come home, start to walk up the stairs, and Walter comes out of his apartment.  He stands in the door way, silent, glaring at me.  I bring my wife the food and tell her to eat quickly because we're leaving as soon as she finishes.

I don't even want to know what would have happened to me if I had stayed another day in that complex.

tl;dr

I lived next door to a cracked out Walter White that sold drugs, threatened to kill one of my neighbors, ran a bike chop shop out of a shed in the apartment parking lot, and might have been a wizard"	t5_2t3t8	True
1369902067.0	1fbqmt	RONY 7	MerpMerpMerrp	107	14	7	"(Sorry it's so long, worth it, I promise.)

4 years ago, I was a freshman girl in high school. My house was about 8 blocks from the metro bus stop and every time I came home from school I would walk down the same street, same time.

6 months into the school year, I'm walking home one day when a car stops by the sidewalk and the driver rolls down his window, ""Do you know where St. John's University is?"" Balding, blue eyes, chubby, in his fifties.

""Of course, it's about 5 blocks down that way."" I pointed to my left, ""You see those football stadium lights? There."" I stay on the sidewalk.

He looks over, ""Uh, yeah I do. Thanks."" ""Yeah, no problem."" I watched him drive away, noting how bright his tail lights are.

It wasn't until later that I realized his car was on the wrong side of the road, the cars down my side of the sidewalk should have been facing me.

For the next few months, I always got the feeling that I kept seeing that same car over and over again, every few weeks. When I'm halfway down the block to my house, a car would drive past me and stop at the end of the block, presumably for the stop sign. I would glance at the back of the car and wonder why cars in my neighborhood all look the same. I pay it no mind.

2 months into my sophomore year, it was a rainy afternoon, I was walking home with my hood up. Halfway down the block my house and a car stops next to me again, ""Do you know where Union Turnpike is?""

""Yeah, you're gonna have to turn right at the block ahead and make a left-""

""What? Go left?""

""No you can't because next block's a one way-""

""Wait, what?""

*Is this guy dense?* I walk closer to his car, thinking he couldn't hear me over the rain, and go up to his window.

""You have to drive down the street ahead first before you can make a left, and just keep going down until you read Union-"" And for some unknown reason, I happen to glance down at his lap. His pants were unzipped and his hand was holding his erect member, stroking up and down. Look back up, his blue eyes are staring right at me, just the most nonchalant expression except for that piercing stare. I freeze, pretend I didn't see it.

""Yeah just that way."" Speed walk the fuck to my house.

My dad was home early that day and happened to look out the window as I was walking home, saw the whole ordeal. He took a look at my ashen face when I shut the front door and asked, ""Hey what happened? That car was weird, it was on the wrong side of the road.""

""Um, dad...""

I told him, he flew into a rage and jumped into his car intending to find the guy. He said he recognized the build, it's a Ford Explorer. He drove around the whole neighborhood and came back with no results. My parents urged me to file a police report. Besides being a little startled and shaken, I thought nothing of it. Being a girl in New York City, you tend to meet tons of creepy people. *It's no big deal*, I said. *I bet the police get this all the time anyways, flashers everywhere*, I said.

But sometimes I would still think of it and get all indignant, thinking I should've confronted him and yelled instead of looking away.

**TWO YEARS LATER**, I was then a senior nearing graduation. I'm a big girl now. I get home early from classes and go to pick up my little sister from elementary school, holding her tiny hands and having her talking about her day, halfway down the block from my house...when that fucking car pulls up again. I tense up. I recognize it. 

""Hey, do you know-""

""**NO**."" I stare right at him and said it loudly, firmly. With my little sister right next to me I couldn't say anything that was racing through my mind, afraid of scaring her. *How DARE you. How fucking dare you. I am with a little child. And there is no way in hell you are getting near her. Did you think I wouldn't remember you? You think I'd stay quiet and walk away again while you get off scaring girls?*

He looked startled, and drove off without a word. I looked at his license place, RONY 7. Dark blue Ford explorer. *Got you, motherfucker.*

I put all the pieces together and realized, this man had been stalking me **for four years**. He knew where I'd walk, when I'd get home, and he knew where my house is. I went straight to the police and reported everything.

About 2 months later, I get off the city bus, crossed the intersection and was about to walk down the same way to my house when I stopped dead in my tracks. RONY 7, only this time it's cream colored and parked in front of a house. A house I would walk past every single day.

I don't know what the police did with my report, I don't know if they ever gave him warning or gave him time. But I still walk past his house, see his car. I know his intent was never to harm or kidnap, but to merely scare. There are people like him who target young girls, and gets off on startling them and feeling big and powerful. I've seen him one more time since then, walking past his house and he was on his balcony. I paused a little, stared right at him and maintained eye contact. *I dare you.* 

He looked away.

**TL;DR: Man flashed me, thought nothing of it. Later realized he stalked me for 4 years, reported to police. Saw him again, stare down, victorious.**"	t5_2t3t8	True
1368482754.0	1e9udx	Who is that boy you keep talking to?	PhedreRachelle	117	25	27	"When I was about 9 years old, we lived in a small to medium sized military town. We lived directly on the base, which was gated but not too difficult to get in to. 

My sister was 6, and we were both blonde haired, blue eyed kids, and our mom just loved to dress us in matching outfits. We went to the same school, which was about a 15 minute walk from our house. There were 2 wooded areas in between our house and the school. We were allowed to walk alone, being a military zone and all. We were supposed to stick to the road, but we just *loved* going through the woods. 

One day a guy in a red truck was driving down the road and was trying to get us to talk to him. We were very sternly taught not to talk to strangers so we stayed pretty far back and eventually he left. But then we started to see him all the time. 

We would see him on the way to school. He would show up at the park and talk to all of the kids. Eventually I learned his name and he wasn't so scary anymore. Just that friendly guy who actually gave us kids the time of day. So I started talking about him at home. My mom checked with our neighbours and other kids' parents and none of them knew who this guy was. So she told us not to talk to him anymore. So we stopped.

Then he disappeared, and I wasn't sure why. Thankfully my mom was one of those parents who didn't believe kids understood or could hear adult conversations. I had already developed quite a habit of eavesdropping, and this is how I found out the truth.

Turns out they found a mother and her daughter murdered in a river ravine. Both had been raped. They found the suspect quickly, witnesses saw only a red truck going in and coming back out again. (I have no idea if he was charged, all I know is what I heard from listening in that time)

Just one of the things I wish I never knew, it made me very distrustful of men. Someone directly tried to abduct me at a younger age too. This time he just bent down and picked me up *while I was walking down the street with my mom.* The only reason he failed was that my mom was holding my hand, and so she ripped me back and ran to the nearest business. 

Both of these happened while living in a general region that was predominantly middle eastern and asian, and so I guess young blonde girls with blue eyes were the going commodity? I'm just going to go shudder at the potential... (and want to be clear going commodity because rarity)"	t5_2t3t8	True
1367777524.0	1dqpu3	Coconut Boy	cadeea	117	27	16	"When working the last shift at a grocery store, you tend to encounter a particular group of people that are lacking in social graces and common sense. After all, the odd ducks need to crawl out of the woodwork buy food, too. This is one of the many encounters I had at Wild Oats (later to become Whole Foods) that is located in the slightly seedier part of central Tucson. 

The year was 2006, and I was an 18-19 year-old female working the juice bar near the front of the store. Quite a few creepy things happened during my employment there, and all of them happened when I was working juice bar shift. It was my first job, and was located just a seven minute walk from my old apartment, which was pretty sweet. You get some pretty interesting characters coming through, from the suburban yuppie yoga moms to homeless hippies with a penchant for pilfering. It's a pretty diverse crowd and, being one of the few health food stores in Tucson at the time, we tended to attract a lot of regulars. This isn't necessarily a good thing.


At this time, we had the Golden Rule policy with our customers. If it was a minute to close, you **had** to do whatever they wanted, even if it took you fifteen minutes to do it. This naturally attracted a lot of assholes who took advantage of it, but hey. “You piss off one customer, and they’ll tell nine of their friends to stop shopping at the store.” *Well,* you think, *if they’re anything like the original customer, then* **good**! You may have guessed that my opinions did not exactly jive with management’s. 


This particular customer was the exception, however. I don't know his real name. He may have introduced himself at one point, but none of us ever cared to commit it to memory. He had very pale skin, almost tinged blue, and giant red slabs for lips that he’d slurp the strangest concoctions with. His hair was dark and curly and his eyes fishdead and hooded. He came and sat at the juice bar right around closing time each night. I think he may have planned it. I always like to take apart the juicer and let it soak before close because beet, carrot, and spinach particles are hellua hard to get off the blades. When I’d reassemble the machine, he’d be there. With 4lbs of produce for me to juice.


He had done enough weird things during the day to piss even my store director, Al, off. We always referred to him as Coconut Boy behind the counter, because of the whole coconuts he’d bring over from the produce section for us to open. We were always pretty busy, and this jackass would slam his coconuts on the countertop and demand to be taken care of first. Al happened to be within earshot one time, and decided it would be better for everyone if I gave him my knife and he opened the coconuts himself. At this point, both of us behind the counter looked incredulously at Al, then at CB. Surely he couldn’t be serious…


Oh but he was, so we gave it to him. Not even a second in possession of the knife did CB start hacking away at it with unholy fervor. He was raising the knife *above his head* and slamming with all the force his tiny, dilapidated muscles could handle (which, surprisingly, was quite a bit). One of the yoga yuppies nearly had her eye put out as he was doing this *at the crowded bar*. Realizing his error, Al then tried to wrestle the knife away from CB before a potential lawsuit could unfurl and sternly told us to ***never*** give CB a knife again. Typical.


So Coconut Boy was already on management’s shitlist when he came in the next day, a minute after closing time. I had already cleaned my area up when I saw him sitting with his produce at the bar. My supervisor must’ve seen my face fall, and took it upon herself to tell CB that we were closed for the evening, and will not, under any circumstance, juice his veggies. At this point, he goes creepy. Smacking his lips, he comes behind the counter and tries to pick up the blender. Starts saying what a nice blender it is, and if he could take it home. Kate, my supervisor, loses it and tells him to get the fuck out. She had to push him out of the juice bar and explain why customers are not allowed back there. During this, one of the ineffectual frontend managers comes by and orders us to make his drink. Not wanting to clean the machine again, I lie and say that a piece in back is still soaking. Kate backs me up. I tell them the blender is still available, however, if the customer would like a fruit smoothie. I was giving my best f-u smile at this time.


Well, that didn’t stop him. He had me *blend* carrots with the tops still on, beets, jicama, red peppers, an unpeeled bulb of garlic, cabbage, kale, and some other funky veggies that I couldn’t identify. I told him that I needed to add water for it to blend properly, and he asked me if it was organic. Not exactly sure how to answer that, I said yes. End result? A fibrous mass of compost that both looked and smelled repulsive. Feeling a bit petulant at this time, I stuck a straw in the largest of the containers (there were four) holding his stew.


He tried to slurp it up with the straw, but failed. There were too many chunks in it. Digging his pasty hands with dirty nails into the concoction, he then proceeded to shovel globs of the muck past his slimy red lips, making for several very disgusting sounds and a huge mess. Smears of green-purple goo slid down his chin while making eye contact with both Kate and myself. Horrified with the mess he was making, the frontend manager finally told him to leave. He argued with her about it because he hadn’t finished, but she had her way and he was out the side set of doors in a matter of minutes. At this time, it was 20 past close, and we were hustling to get everything cleaned up so we could go home.


Kate finished before me. She had jumped in her beat-up red jeep with zebra seat covers (with a sexy Jesus bobble head on the dash) and booked it back to her place. Being the last one out, nearly an hour past close, the frontend manager escorted me to the front door so she could lock up. My apartment was within easy walking distance, so I nodded goodnight to her and set off.


My path home took me past Zia’s, across the parking lot to Ike’s, and down to the Quebedeaux car dealership where I’d make a right onto Richey. Richey would then intersect with 2nd Street and my place was right on the corner. It’s pretty well lit until you get off Speedway, so I always felt reasonably safe taking it late at night. At that hour, there are no other pedestrians on the street because all of the shops are closed, and all of the bars are further down the road. Even so, I am always on alert. Being a slender, young white girl with a pretty face feels akin to being a plump gazelle in a room full of hungry lions when you’ve lived in this neighborhood. You can say what you want, or that I’m being a paranoid white woman crying rape whenever I bump elbows with a stranger, but hey. Guess who’s still alive?


That being said, I heard a footstep echo behind me passing the door of Zia’s. Glancing behind, I saw a figure coming out of the shadows walking towards me. It was too dark for me to make out a face, but I felt hairs on my arms start to prickle. It had an odd gait, and started loping after me once it saw my head turn. By then, the figure had come under one of the walkway lights and I saw my old buddy CB with the freakiest deadpan expression on his face charging towards me. **With a coconut in each hand.**


At that point, my legs were pumping furiously to get me the fuck out of there. I had never been much for running, but adrenaline does some pretty amazing things when fight or flight is activated. I guess on some base level I thought it would be a good idea to take an alternate route home, because I zigzagged through the parking lot and took a back path off the main street, jumping over concrete pylons into the empty lot behind the shopping complex. I whipped my head to look behind and could still see him galloping through the parking lot after me. Thoroughly freaked out now, I jolted down a little side alley between some duplexes and encountered a chain link fence. Normally, I’d turn around and find another way, but I was up and over that fence in a matter of seconds and sliding on gravel as felt my shoes *levitate* half-way down the street. I don’t remember how I got home from that point, I think my brain was on autopilot, but my legs gave out as soon as I locked my front door and I crawled to pass out in my closet.


The next morning I firmly told the store director that I would be filing a restraining order. Surprisingly enough, I got support from my coworkers to file a formal complaint and permanently ban him from the store. We filed an incident report, Al had a talk with him the next time he came in, and I haven’t heard from him since. The end.



TL;DR: Annoying customer turns into Creepazoid and charges after me with coconuts on my way home.

1352095315.0	12nlks	He came back.	collegegay	104	8	11	"Hey guys. A close friend of mine recommended me tell this story on Reddit (took me forever to find this particular category!). It's nothing scary--at least, not compared to some of the horrifying stories on here. It still scared me, and I hope it never happens again!

Onward to the story! A little info about me: I live in a somewhat affluent apartment complex that's just a mile or two away from my college campus. I'm 22, about 6'1"", 175... nothing to strike fear into the hearts of criminals. I'm average. I live with my boyfriend, Ty, and our roommate (the friend that recommended me post this story here) Jess. 

Jess is often at her boyfriend's apartment every night (which is across the city, about 15-20 minutes away). Ty works a third shift job as a security guard on campus (what he actually does: homework while sitting behind a desk while ""real"" security guards handle the bad guys). I like to tease him about it. (Sidetracked, oops!)

Anyway, this story happened about three-ish weeks ago. It was Wednesday night, I was home alone at around 1am. Everyone was out, so I was sitting in the living room, doing my homework in the dark while watching a movie. It was something over Existentialist novels. I don't know. Boring shit.

I was engrossed in the paper, because it was due the next day at 7am. I was getting really into it, when there's a knock at the door. At first I didn't hear it, because I was listening to the movie and distracted all at the same time. So it didn't really register. Then I heard more knocking. Immediately, the first thing I did was mute the volume. I listened.

More knocking. Instantly, I felt like something was wrong. You've heard people talk about gut instincts and the little voice in your head shouting, ""RED ALERT RED ALERT!""? That's what happened to me.

I didn't answer it, but the knocking kept coming. I got up and looked out the window, but I couldn't really see that much. I couldn't see who was standing in front of our door, and the peephole was covered with some Halloween decoration. I waited for a bit, then I heard the neighbors leave, walking in front of my door. Two girls, laughing about something. I thought that it wasn't anything/anyone bad, so I opened the door.

It was a guy, about 25, very handsome. His eyes were hazel, had a bit of scruff. (Who am I kidding? He was hot.) I was stunned. He looked at me (we were the same height), and then got this dreamy look on his face. 

I asked him if he was looking for someone. He replied, ""Is Ty around?"" I smiled, thinking it was one of Ty's friends from class or work, so I just told him the whole situation with his job. The guy nodded, smiled, and thanked me. He went away, walking down the stairs. I shut (and locked!) the door, and went back to my paper.

About 20 minutes later, there was another knock. I wasn't feeling paranoid or afraid, because my other neighbors were having a party a few doors down, and I could hear people out and about. So, thinking it was one of my neighbors inviting me to a party, I opened the door.

Same guy. Standing there, staring at me. 

""Can I help you?"" I asked, leaning against the door frame.

""Do you know when Ty gets off?"" He was looking past me, into the apartment. His eyes focused on the TV. 

I told the guy I didn't know, and that it varied every shift he worked. The guy nodded, apologized for coming by, but didn't leave right away.

""I really like Daniel Day Lewis,"" the guy awkwardly said, in regards to the movie I was watching. (I was watching *There Will Be Blood*.) I nodded, trying to be polite, and bid him goodnight. I watched him leave again.

I was starting to get creeped out, so I called Ty. He answered. I told him about the guy that came by twice. Ty was confused, and asked if I knew his name. I never asked him. He told me to not answer the door anymore, and call security if he comes back a third time. 

I started to feel a little panicked, but managed to calm down and finish my paper. It was about 3am at this point, and I was getting sleepy. I was in the process of dozing off, when there's another knock. It's more urgent. My pulse suddenly increased, and I felt my skin crawling.

Then the knocking stopped. I felt relieved, because I had our apartment complex's security on speed dial, ready to go. I got up next to the door, trying to look out the window. The next thing I know, there's a big BANG from the other side. Like some brute force was being thrown against the door. I was in utter terror, falling back onto the couch. The guy kept ramming himself against the door, then he stopped. 

I was already on the phone with security, but there was no answer. Then the window SHATTERED. I watched the man crawl inside my fucking apartment. I pressed the green call button on my phone right as the man pulled himself through the window. I ran into our bedroom, shutting the door behind me. I was on the phone with the 911 operator at the same time.

I could hear the guy ramming himself against the bedroom door, then silence, then I heard things crashing around on the other side. I started banging on the wall above our bed, hoping my neighbors would hear. The 911 operator was telling me to calm down and tell me where I lived. I told her exactly where I was, multiple times, over and over. I heard glass shatter from the living room.

Then I heard *two voices* talking. Then sirens. I remember hearing one guy say to the other, ""He's in there.""

Then, the worst thing you can ever hear in a situation like this: *""We can come back.""*

Then there was scattering, crunching of glass, and the sound of the door opening. I was a wreck, and I had managed to get myself under the bed somehow. I stayed that way until the police showed up. I refused to open the door until one of them (what a sweetheart!!) put his badge under the door so I'd believe them. 

Turns out they stole my laptop, blu-ray player, TV, and a few other odds and ends. It was treated as a robbery, and they did all of the dusting for fingerprints thing and stuff. They didn't find anything.

Ty, Jess and I stayed with mutual friends for a week after, too terrified to go back. Just last week, two guys were arrested breaking into a house about 15 miles away from our apartment complex. Our TV, blu ray player, and other items were discovered with them.

Thankfully, the guys were caught, went away, we got our stuff back.

Oh, and I submitted my paper in on time, no worries. :-)"	t5_2t3t8	True
1351282497.0	1253jh	STOP FUCKING TOUCHING ME	walnutwhale	119	26	17	"Seattle is a beautiful place. It doesn't rain nearly as much as people are lead to believe, it's covered in greenery, and has a vibrant and wonderful art and music culture. The people in Seattle are polite and keep themselves - we are very Nordic in our penchant for passive aggressive, solitary behavior. This is the sort of city that if you make eye contact with someone, they generally believe you are out to get something out of them, so they hasten by or cross the street to avoid you.

When I first moved here, being a farm girl from a small town in Alaska and then Idaho, I was completely disconcerted by the attitudes that I encountered. But after three years of residing in this quiet and lovely place, I have come to appreciate the live and let live attitude that most Seattle residents have. It's very zen and perpetuates a very good atmosphere of creativity, and when you DO talk to people it makes for intellectual and intriguing conversation.

But we have a seedy underground - many, many homeless people. Depressed people who fell into drugs; people with mental illness who rove the streets ranting to themselves. I have been to many cities in my travels over the years, and with all else in Seattle our homeless people are some of the polite-est I have encountered. If you deny giving them change, often they will still wish you a good day with a smile. Occasionally they are aggressive, but if you break out of your Seattle character and act overbearing right back at them, they will slither back into their holes in confusion.

Last year I was invited to a very ""exclusive"" fourth of July party, on a balcony overlooking the lake where the fireworks were going to be set off. I dressed in my Bohemian Americana finest and boarded the bus downtown that would take me to the apartment complex where this top floor suite was located. As I was scanning my bus fare card, a homeless man shuffled up behind me. I had seen him several times downtown - he was dark as midnight, always dressed in about 4 or 5 layers of black clothing no matter what the weather. On this particular day the sun was shining and the temperature was in the mid 70s, so he was sweating profusely in his down jacket but seemed unphased. As he walked up the bus stairs behind me, his hand brushed over my butt. I felt my skin crawl, but I shrugged it off as an accident and made my way into the middle of the bus, sitting myself near the window and immediately pulling out my iPhone, taking up my ""I don't want to talk"" posture. I've perfected this stance over my years of Seattle public transit, because as a young, well dressed woman I have a lot of unwelcome attention. Though I am a warm, friendly individual, on the bus I ooze coldness. 

I felt someone sit down next to me and glanced sideways, wondering why this individual had chosen the seat next to me when half the bus was empty. With a slight feeling of dread I realized it was the homeless man who had ""accidentally"" touched my butt. No bother. I went back to my iPhone and pointedly positioned my body towards the window. 

As the bus began to move, the man shifted towards me. It was around this time that I realized how offensive he smelled. I tried to keep myself from gagging and breathed through my mouth, furiously punching at the touch screen on my phone, willing the bus to go faster.

Then, suddenly, I felt it: his hand was touching my thigh. I try to give people the benefit of the doubt. He had set his hand between us and his pinky finger was barely brushing against my thigh. Perhaps it was an accident - I stiffened and pushed myself further against the wall. He shifted towards me again. Shit.

Slowly, he started running his pinky down my thigh. I felt panic and rage building within me. Then he added his ring finger. That was it. I stood up suddenly, drawing to all of my 5'10"" stature and screamed as loudly as I could:

**""DON'T FUCKING TOUCH ME.""**

He leered at me like a cat who had just eaten a canary, his teeth browned and jagged. He was obviously quite pleased with himself. 

This was one of the moments that I hated Seattle's attitude, because not one person on that bus did ANYTHING. A few people looked away from their books and glanced at me, and then quickly hastened to stare out the windows. I went to sit at the front of the bus until my stop, aware of the homeless man's yellowed eyes upon me the entire time. He didn't stop his terrifying grin.

When I ran off the bus and into the party, booze began to calm me down and I ended up having an amazing night. But I still see this homeless man often as I walk around downtown, and despite his obviously addled state he seems to remember me - because every time he sees me, that horrible, wicked smile splits his face again.

Basically, I only realised a few years after this happened just how wrong it was, but even at the time I knew it wasn't great.

In a PE lesson when I was about 7 we were learning hockey skills. We had a new male hockey teacher, about 40 years old, and he got us to start playing to see how good we were. To be honest, I was a little shit at hockey, because I loved hitting the ball really hard to get a goal. After a while, he stopped us, and started showing us better techniques and stuff. Then one of the other kids said he should show me how to hit better (as in, not as hard) because I was being naughty, so he came up behind me and bent over me, holding onto my hockey stick (kind of like how guys do when they're teaching girls how to play golf). Then, the PE teacher started saying I was 'a naughty girl' in a really creepy way and was breathing down my neck. Even at that age I knew it was wrong and I was really panicked, so I started saying I wasn't naughty, but the other kids all seemed to find it funny and kept saying I was naughty (you know, like kids do). Eventually I wriggled away from the PE teacher, but it was really disturbing. When I remembered it a few years ago and processed it properly it really messed me up, and even writing it down now makes me feel weird, because of how much worse it could have turned out, and because I never thought to say anything about it for such a long time.

TL:DR weird PE teacher acted very inappropriately."	t5_2t3t8	True
1341434589.0	w1p13	The Man Across the Street	Exodus_420	110	15	11	"Hi there LetsNotMeet! I've been on this subreddit for a while and have enjoyed it quite a lot. I've had a share of odd/frightening experiences myself, so I decided I'd post a few. Starting with what happened to me last 4th of July.

So last year my friend/neighbor and I were outside in the front of our yards enjoying the fireworks. We were enjoying the sights and sounds of fireworks that filled the warm summer night air, but something was not right.

Across the street from where we live there's an abandoned house, so I can't say that this person was a neighbor or anything. In front of the abandon house, we see what looks like a figure of a man standing there at the side of the house. The house is taken care of by relatives/friends of the people who used to live there, and we figured maybe he was just one of them, even though he didn't look familiar at all. I couldn't see much since it was dark, but he looked like a white guy with long badly kept hair, he seemed rather tall, but with a thin/normal sized body build.

We went back to running around and looking at the fireworks. From my peripheral vision, I catch some sort of movement by the abandoned house across the street.

The man is still there, but this time he is slightly closer to the street than before. Me and my friend go by her house and I tell her that the man is clearly trying to approach us or something, and I don't think he means well. As I am telling her this he suddenly starts to move very, very slowly towards the street, with his vision right towards where we are.

We freak out and go inside her house. I spent a few minutes (I'd say maybe 10-15 minutes) there, and I was a little scared to go home, but I thought ""fuck it, I'm a house away, and the dude must have lost interest by now.""

I go outside and this guy is still across the street. This time he's back by the side of the house. Just staring at me. 

I suddenly realize, maybe this dude isn't a creep or anything. He could be hurt, or lost, maybe sick. So I look over to him and yell out ""Do you need help? Are you okay?"" 

He just stands there showing no sign of wanting to communicate at all. I stand there hoping a response will come, but nothing. At this point I wanted to piss myself. I just felt very uneasy about him. A minute or two passes but it felt like hours. I couldn't take it anymore, I highly doubt he wanted help and I just wanted to go home and feel safe.

I quickly run to my house, I'm on the porch hoping that my mom will open the door quickly. I'm banging on the door, I look back to where the man is.

He's going across the street. And he is walking towards the direction of my house.

My mom finally opens the door and I run inside. I don't know why I didn't think of telling her, I suppose I just didn't want to freak her out or anything.

My other friend calls me and I talk to her for awhile, hoping to calm my nerves a bit. A good twenty minutes had passed by, and out of curiosity I look outside the window across the street.

He's standing in front yard of the abandoned house staring at my house. Completely still, just watching.

I locked all my doors and let my dog inside. I got my phone and waited in my room hoping nothing would happen. My dad got home and I felt more at ease. By then it had been an hour or so since I last saw him, and sure enough he was gone. Haven't seen him since.

I don't really know if I over reacted, but as the old saying goes, it's better to be safe than sorry."	t5_2t3t8	True
1332370961.0	r7hdd	My [Fr]iend gets his closet blessed	Jeli42	117	27	16	"A little background first.  I left my home state a couple years ago in order to ditch everything and start fresh.  I went on national student exchange to another college halfway across the country just to see what I was made of.  I found a place to stay on craigslist despite all of my friends and family telling me it was a bad idea.  It was an old house with a sinking foundation, terrible heating and housed anywhere from just me right before I moved out to 11 when I moved in.  I knew no one there, but now some of those people are my best friends now.  Some of the others, however, I hope to never see again.

The guy living in the basement, Mike, was your typical bro.  I remember him listening at full volume ""Teach me how to Dougie"" at four in the morning multiple times, just dancing with a bunch of dudes in the living room.  The only girls I ever saw him bring home were still in high school, and he was 22.  He made his money by buying and selling things on craigslist (read: stealing and selling).  When I got there he sold me what amounted to hay that he called pot, which I never accused him of because, like i said, I knew no one.  He was always bringing over the sketchiest people, some that couldn't even form a proper sentence, always some kind of high.  Once he even let a bum stay with us.  I never thought anything would happen, but boy was I wrong.

A few months in I was sleeping around midnight when someone came in my room.  This was not uncommon as ten people lived there at that time and drunk friends were always coming over to see someone.  I asked this stranger to get out of my room and find his friend Mike and he left.  About fifteen minutes later I got up to pee and I passed him in the living room next to mine (we had around 4 living rooms) reading an encyclopedia from a couple decades prior.  He never broke his gaze from my eyes as I passed him twice.  Never said a word to me, but he came off as very creepy, and Mike was nowhere to be seen.  I locked my door and went to sleep, expecting nothing to happen.

I woke up the next morning and got ready for class, and as I was leaving I saw a chair with a cooler stacked on top of it right underneath a railing on the third story.  The stairs that led up to the third floor were impossible to find unless you knew where they were, and were always locked as my friends Kevin and Mary, a couple, were living on the third floor and never wanted anyone up there.  At the time Kevin was growing a single marijuana plant  and wanted it to be a secret.  I immediately thought someone had tried to climb the railing, but we had tried before when we were drunk so again I didn't think anything of it.  After I got back from class I heard the whole story.

Kevin and Mary had woken up around six in the morning and had been fooling around for about an hour or so.  Kevin said he saw his closet door open halfway where his plant was and he always closed this for obvious reasons.  He didn't think anything of it.  They fell asleep and woke up again around 9:30.  Mary got up to go to the bathroom, and looked over the banister and saw the makeshift stool.

""It looks like someone tried to climb up here last night,"" she said.

Kevin came out to check.  ""It does.""  He went back into the room, and at this time the light for his plant had come on (it was on a timer).  He saw a shadow of something strange in there.  He pulled back the towel covering the closet (to keep in heat) slowly...to reveal a stranger *naked pulling on his* (in Kevin's words) *monster cock* in the direction of the plant.

""What the fuck are you doing?!"" Kevin said, as if there was a rational explanation for this situation.

""Whoa calm down man, I'm just blessing your plant.""

""No you're not, you're fucking whacking it in my closet!""

""Wait, wait.  I'm a christian, your should be too.  Are you a christian?""

This guy was around 6'5"" and built, Kevin is maybe 5'5"" and 160lbs soaking wet.  Despite this, Kevin hit him in the face as hard as he could and says he felt his jaw crumble.  Kevin has wrestled his whole life, including in college, and knew how to handle a fight.  The guy went down hard and immediately bounced back up.  Scared at how the hit caused nearly no reaction, Kevin screams ""Get the fuck out of my room!""  The guy was backing out trying to calm Kevin down.  

""Come on dude, wait.""  Kevin stopped, he didn't know what to do next.  The guy says again, ""I need to bless your plant.  Are you a christian?""

Kevin hits him again, the guy falls, and bounces right back up.  The amazing and sick thing about it was that through all of this, the guy was still tugging on his erect ""monster cock,"" even through being punched in the face twice.  Kevin got him to the attic stairs and pushed him down them.  These stairs were about half the size of normal stairs and ended with a doorway about half the size of a normal one.  Imagine a masturbating naked 6'5"" man tumbling down this and then acting as if nothing happened.  The guy finally let go of himself after one more punch to the face and being kicked down the stairs to the first floor, the end of which had a banister that ended with a flat piece of wood on top with a very sharp corner, which he caught at full tumble in the middle of his back.  Kevin said the sound his back created made him think he had killed him, or at the very least broke something.  After laying motionless for a second the guy still staggered to his feet and Kevin pushed him out the front door.

The guy, in the only sober moment in the whole event, turned around and looked genuinely sad.  Staring back at Kevin, naked as the day he was born, he said ""Come on, dude.  I'm naked.""  For a brief moment, Kevin felt sorry for him.  That moment quickly passed.  ""Fuck you!""  he said, and slammed the door.

We found out from the cops later that the guy had ran to a school across the street.  Someone there saw him and gave him some shorts, then called the cops.  He was arrested shortly after.  Apparently he wasn't high on anything, but had stopped taking his meds and had been drinking.  We ended up telling Mike that we didn't feel comfortable with him bring people over and he should leave the house, which he did.  The naked guy, as far as I know, is still in a psychiatric hospital.

Thinking about it later, we realized that the guy had been in his room *at least* since Kevin and Mary had woken up the first time at six.  This also means he was in there the whole time they were fooling around.  The clothes he had taken off were left in Kevin's closet and we never touched them, and we refused to ever smoke anything off that plant."	t5_2t3t8	True
1361822700.0	197km6	Caravans, just as bad as Trailers	SaxonWitch	113	21	16	"I meant to write this one down earlier, then I read about the weirdo that was scaring the kids in the trailer and remembered. This may be a long while ago but not only is it etched in my mind, my parents always remembered and we spoke sometimes about the 'lucky escape' we had.

This took place in Germany in the mid 70's on a caravan park where each plot  had a low wooden fence and the caravans and fore-tents were well maintained. Also these were long term plots were most people owned their caravan and all the families knew each other. Everyone was only there for the weekend or holidays.

I was about 6 or 7 at the time and the other girl, my friend was a year younger. Our parents were off having a party at the local drinking hole whilst they left us together in my friend's caravan. Those were the 70's and remember that not only were neighbours close but an adult would pop in to check on us every hour or so. 

We were told not to let anyone in under any circumstances [something you only have to tell me once and I would obey as if programmed. However other kids are not like me and this is where the problem arose.

Anyway. There were two guys who had a caravan that nobody liked, they just didn't fit in with the 'tidy' weekenders. They were always drunk, obscene, swearing in front of us kids and they looked like tramps and smelled like tramps. People only just tolerated them but one lovely summer morning we woke up with them staring at us through the open back window of our caravan, giving us a shock and causing my dad to lose it and run after them to beat the shit out of them but they had legged it.

This little interlude is so that you know what weirdos we were dealing with.

So that night my friend and I were locked in [from the inside], playing, watching TV, eating snacks and generally having a good time.
Then we heard someone knocking on the door. We immediately kept quiet and didn't do anything but they knocked again, this time really violently. Then we heard shouting: ""Open up!"".

I remember distinctly feeling frightened for my life, with churning guts and the lot. We started crying and told them that we were alone and not allowed to let anyone in.
Foolish thing to say but we were really small and frightened.
So teh it got worse, the were banging and kicking and swearing and telling us to open the door or we would regret it. they said that they were adults and that we had to do what they say and stuff along those lines.

This is where my friend whose caravan it was lost it and opened the door even though I was screaming not to do it.

They slung the door open and came in and seriously I thought that we would get murdered [yes I was only a kid but I was already reading horror comics - and seriously that was what kept me alert, rather than naive]. 
They came in and sat right next to us on the U-shaped bench around the table, so we couldn't get away and they started saying that they wanted kisses and stuff like that. they put their arms around us and it really felt wrong [even though I didn't really know about this kind of thing, I had some sort of gut feeling that this was some grown-up stuff and very very wrong].

Eventually my self preservation won and I started screaming. I screamed really loudly ""Help"" ""Help us"" and just scream my lungs out. The two men got really annoyed but I recon now, that they were too pissed to react violently. As a matter of fact I that they may not have even really known what they were doing [only on a very basic level].

They told me to ""shut up"" and shouted other stuff, telling me not to ""exaggerate"", but the cowards they were, they got up and legged it. Maybe because they knew that the immediate neighbour had heard and was on the way.

I closed the door and had a go at my friend for opening it. Minutes later our parents turned up, blaming themselves for leaving us [my parents believed that I wouldn't have opened the door but they had to  have a 'mock' lecture with both of us to listen what we were told, I still remember how injust that felt to me]. BTW my parents were the best and I can not fault them at all, they eventually told me they believed me.

Anyway, what happened to those child-scarers? Our dads had a ""go"" at them, several other guys helping [but the official story was that we ""didn't need to be scared"" any longer]. Also they got chucked out of the caravan park, which was fenced and had a log cabin guard house with a barrier you had to get past. Maybe they even involved the Police. All I know is that the adults were taking it well seriously.

Years later I understand in how much danger we really were in and how lucky we were and how much I am glad that I started screaming when I did."	t5_2t3t8	True
1361291923.0	18tp8w	His name was Davey...Part 3	NameUnavailable12345	142	49	13	"After some time, I met his real mother and his younger siblings, a twin brother and sister, (Jay and Jamie) who were absolutely adorable. They were about 15 when when Davey and I were 18. His mother took a real liking to me as did his siblings, however, I noticed that Davey wasn't really close with any of them. I shrugged it off as issues from the divorce and never really pressed him for information, assuming he'd talk to me when he was ready. I enjoyed spending time at his mothers house as she actually talked to him and seemed generally interested in Davey's life unlike his dads' family. 

Jay and Jamie were the sweetest kids in the world, often texting me and sending me silly pictures. I even hung out with them a few times without Davey present. This, of course, angered Davey(bc how dare I do something without him) so I didn't do it often. But I always enjoyed those times with Jay and Jamie. They really did feel like my little brother and sister. We were pretty close knit. However, Davey saw this as an excuse to make sure he was around more and more and before long, we had become inseparable. 

It got to the point where I was literally in Tennessee half the week and Georgia the other half. So I decided to make the move to Tennessee. Lacey had already hooked me up with a new job, my aunt and uncle said I could rent out the pool house, and there was a school in the area I was considering going to. When I told Davey, he was estatic and couldn't wait until I was just 30min away rather than 2hrs. He kept going on about how we could finally spend every single day together. At one point crying, saying he could stop suffering.

We'd been dating for about 6mos at this point and it was about 3wks before the big move when we had our first really big argument. Davey had been ignoring my texts and calls for a few days and only giving small replies. Thinking he was mad at me, I tried calling up one of our mutual friends to see if she knew what was up. Our mutual friend told me that while I was in Georgia, Davey would frequently go to college parties with Zak and get wasted to the point where couldn't remember anything that happened. Zak was getting laid at about just everyone of these parties(even knocked a girl up at one point) and the mutual friend expressed concern that he was cheating on me. 

Of course, I confronted Davey about it and he grew furious in his denial. We argued on the phone for hours, most of the time with me crying my eyes out. He assured me that he hadn't cheated on me and that our mutual friend was a liar. Every time I questioned something, Davey would lose his shit and call me a fucking bitch or a lying cunt then accuse *me* of cheating. Just horrible awful stuff really. But what did stupid me do? Oh you guessed it, I stayed with him. (Fucker did cheat on me btw)

When the big moving day came around, Lacey and Davey drove to Georgia to help me move. They took Lacey's car as I'm pretty sure she was scared of Davey's driving on the interstate. Davey was not happy about this and asked if he could drive my car back to Tennessee as to prove his driving abilities to Lacey. I reluctantly agreed, but figured 'eh whats the worst that could happen?' I'll never forget how wrong I was. 

We got in a fight in the car, I don't even remember what started it but he was accusing me of talking to one of my guy friends. Yep, you read that right. Talking to a guy friend. Not flirting or cheating, but talking. The argument lasted all the way up the interstate and I'd finally just given up on trying to reason with him. When we were almost home, we came to a pretty major intersection between two four lane roads. Lacey came to a stop at the light in front of us and Davey was too busy cursing me out to notice. I looked up just in time to see Davey looking away from the road and Lacey's SUV getting closer and closer. I went rigid and tried to say something, anything...but it was too late.

We slammed into the back of Lacey's car. Both cars were sent into the middle of the intersection where we were instantaneously T-boned by oncoming traffic. All my windows, including my windshield had shattered and my doors had been pinched shut. The only real way we made it out of my car was through the sunroof which had been open before the crash. I'm very blurry on the accident in general and only know as much detail as I do because I saw the traffic cam. The only things I really remember are sounds and just images like a still photo, nothing in motion. I don't remember screaming but Davey reported that I had right before impact. All I remember is tires screeching, glass shattering, and the sound of metal crumpling. 

For some reason, the passenger airbags didn't go off and I hit my head on the dash. Hard. Or at least I'm assuming that's what I hit my head on because like I said, I really don't remember. The entirety of the right side of my face black and blue. My eye swollen shut and it hurt just to open my mouth to speak. I was lucky that nothing was broken, just severely bruised. I had a long bruise from my hip to shoulder from the seat belt. My belly button piercing was ripped out and my right ear was pretty cut up. I had some glass stuck in various cuts on the side of my head and arms and, naturally, a large amount of whiplash. Lacey's and Davey's airbags went off so they weren't quite as battered, but they did end up getting some pretty bad airbag burns.

In that accident, four cars got totalled. By some miracle, nobody was killed or even critically injured. But, I had basically just moved to a new town only to lose my car. I still ended up getting a check from insurance for a new car even though Davey was driving. (Don't ask me how, my dad handled it all and I've never wanted to know if the check really was from insurance or not.) I did not break up with Davey after that, in fact I became more dependent on him until I got a new car. I think I thought the trauma of the accident would pull us closer together and fix all our problems. For a few days, maybe even a week, it did. I was starting to see the old Davey again. But it all changed very quickly.

Davey developed some type of PTSD after the accident. I mean, it was a scary thing for all of us and I still have nightmares to this day. But he went overboard. Like he shut off his phone, didn't go to class, deleted his facebook, essentially just disappeared for a week. Nobody could get ahold of him, not even Jay or Jamie. I reached out to some his friends and none of them had heard from him either and were even more surprised when I hadn't heard from either. 

This is how I got very close to Davey's friend Mark. Mark was quirky and weird, but also a great listener. I confided in him and told him everything that was going on. He was surprised and sad to hear this was going on but did his best to comfort me until we found out what was going on with Davey. 

After about a week and a half, Davey reappeared and when I asked him about it, he just said, ""I needed some space for a few days."" and didn't understand why I was so worried. Things went on shakily, but somewhat back to normal after that. But I had began to notice the change in Davey though and was fearful of the person he was becoming. 

His room that had been oh-so clean was filthy. Like we're talking pigsty. Davey would spill drinks or food and just leave it. There was bacteria growing in multiple cups, bottles, and plates scattered around his room. He ruined a glass by using it as a place to stick all his gum. There was moldy food laying around, some of it on the floor. You couldn't see his floor at all. There were piles upon piles of clothes, blankets, shoes, towels, trash(pizza boxes, soda cartons, shopping bags), and just utter filth. Jay, Jamie, and I cleaned it up once while they were over visiting their father and it was literally filthy again within a few days. The bathroom was even more disgusting, but the memory still evokes a gag from me so I shall spare you the details.

Davey was angry all the time, losing his shit to something as simple as somebody driving past us. Not even swerving around us or doing anything rude to us, just passing us. He began to frequently snapping at me over nothing. And I mean nothing. 

For example, one day we were messing around at his house and like throwing stuff at each other like shoes or whatever was on the floor really. I tossed my flip flop in his direction and he moved at last second, causing the flip flop to hit him in the face. He leapt up, threw the shoe at the wall as hard as he could then threw my purse for good measure. He shoved me back which made me trip and fall, then screamed in my face to ""Get the fuck out!"" I just froze up, unable to move. After a few minutes, Davey calmed down and apologized for yelling, telling me I should be more careful next time and know better than to be ignorant. I left shortly after that and we didn't hang out for a few more days. 

The next time I saw him, it was his twin brother and sisters birthday so we picked them up from school and went to a restaurant to meet their mom. On the drive, Davey got in an argument with Jamie about driving. I don't even remember how it started, but basically Jamie had insulted his driving somehow. He started yelling and screaming at Jamie while we're driving down the highway. Jamie burst into tears and I'm begging him to calm down as I'm already having flashbacks to the car accident. 

Davey then proceeds to scream at me and go on about how the car accident was my fault. How I was the fucking bitch who distracted him and if my dumbass hadn't gotten him angry then the accident wouldn't have happened. At this point, Jay piped up and said, ""Davey, I'm pretty sure you're the one who rear ended the other car. So why don't you shut the fuck up, stop blaming your girlfriend, and stop yelling at our sister. Nobody here is a perfect driver, especially not you. Now pay attention to the fucking road before you kill us."""	t5_2t3t8	True
1358708670.0	16xwj5	Driving home	FacetiousBitch	129	38	9	"This is a story that I seldom tell because every time I even think about it I re-experience that strange day. It may not seem like such a dreadful thing when most people hear my story which is why I choose not to discuss it.


It was a late night in December I just finished finals and the semester was over. I was really excited to head home for the first time all semester to see my folks. My parent’s house was about an hour away from my college so the drive isn’t too bad, but this night the drive felt like it would never end. It started at a red light. When I came to a stop for some reason I pulled up directly next to the car in the other lane so our windows were facing each other. Something which I usually never do because I feel like people stare at me. However this time when I turned my head for a second to check if the driver was staring at me, I saw a man or at least someone who looked like a man, but something was off about him. He had sunglasses on at night which I thought was odd. He had an extremely pale face and he seemed to be laughing. His face would never turn away and he continued to stare at me. The traffic light seemed like it would never change. 


Finally the light turns green and I press the gas like there’s no tomorrow. As you might have guessed this strange man begins to follow me. No matter how fast I go. He doesn’t take his eyes off me and we’re driving excessive speeds on this empty road side by side. Everything was happening so fast and so I thought of turning onto a random road to lose this guy. He continues follows me. My heart sinks. I panic. I don’t know what to do or where to go. I decide to pull into a driveway at a random house to see if he’d leave. He pulls up from behind and proceeds to get out of the vehicle. He runs towards me this time his smile vanishes and he’s instead crying. He begins to bang on my window sobbing and screaming. I back out and bolt out of there. He doesn’t follow me this time, but when I finally get home I realize that I left school too early. I have one more final tomorrow and I have to go back on that road. I haven't seen that man since.

This is a great subreddit; thank you for sharing your experiences!]

Me:  Female, 25
Setting:  Nice neighborhood, suburban Midwest

One of my biggest fears is someone breaking into my home.  I'm an extremely light sleeper, so the slightest noise, light, anything otherwise disturbing the darkness and silence as I sleep, will wake me.  My parents live in a neighborhood that is very nice, very wealthy, heavily wooded with houses quite close to one another until you reach the end of it, where our house was located.  The houses are a bit further a part, and until recently, it was far less built up than the area near the entrance.  Our yard isn't too large, and there aren't mature trees, but there is a large field that breaks up our neighborhood and the one behind it.  We have a ranch style house, and my bedroom has two large windows that gives me a view to the front yard.  From my bed, I can see the yard lamp that provides a rather small pool of light.  Just beyond that is the road.  The other window looked into part of my backyard. 

Preface of sorts:

When I was in high school, my boyfriend used to sneak over to stay the night quite a few times.  This is a rather disgusting detail, but he would open up my bedroom window that looked into the backyard in order to take a piss (I didn't have screens).  One night at about 12 a.m., mid-piss, he sort of freaked out, saying he saw someone walking around the backyard.  He quickly adjusted himself, closed the window, and I took a look out back.  I could vaguely see an outline of someone surveying the property, almost near the deck.  I panicked, and immediately ran out to go wake up my dad.  He jumps out of bed, sort of storms out to the deck, turns the outside lights on and looks around.  He can't see anything, so he decides to go have a walk around the deck.  Again, nothing.  He goes back to bed; I'm terrified.

Two more bizarre instances occurred.  The second one, also involving my boyfriend during high school.  His mother was compliant with him staying over for a bit because she understood my dad was strict and so she'd agree to come pick him up in the evening when my dad wouldn't allow him there.  She would park quite a bit up the street and wait for him to jump out my window and walk over.  This evening, at about 11 p.m., well after my dad went to sleep, my boyfriend left, and I watched as he slowly made his way through the dark yard.  I could see his mother's car in the distance.  Abruptly, I saw his figure gain speed, swiftly walking until he broke out in a sprint toward the headlights.  I was confused, but assumed that he was eager to get to her car.  As soon as her car took off, however, he called me on his mother's cell phone, saying that someone was watching him and started to chase him.  I was afraid and sort of doubted his story.  But, I decided I didn't want to bother my dad yet again.  I tried to sleep it off.

Fast forward to 3 years later, when I am 19.  I was back home for the summer from college.  I was enrolled in a summer language program, and I had gotten back from work at 10 p.m.  I needed to do homework and was up quite late working.  Near 1 a.m., I noticed that something wasn't right with the yard lamp out front.  My curtains are quite thin, so a change in the light was noticeable.  I pulled them slightly open and saw what appeared to be a person standing in front of it, to where they were blocking the glow.  Then, a red cloth was thrown over the light.  I was terrified, not knowing what the hell was going on, so I threw my books, ran to my dad's room, and woke him up.  He looks out the front windows near the door, sees the read cloth, and mutters a ""What the fuck,"" before walking out front.  He takes off the cloth, looks around, and comes back inside.  It was a red towel.  He says it's probably some dumb kids, puts the towel in the laundry room, and he went back to bed.  I was still anxious and creeped out, thinking it was some kind of marker or symbol for something.  I'll add that after washing the towel, it is in the linen closet in the bathroom in regular use by my household.  *facepalm*  

The Story of Stories:

I wanted to include the above instances to give you an idea of how I developed my anxiety and general uneasiness about prowlers, potential intruders, creepers, etc.  This instance occurred over the summer, when I was again staying at my parents' house for a few months before moving to another city.  As I said, I'm a very light sleeper, and the curtains that my mother put up in my bedroom are nearly sheer.  It was about 3 a.m., and I was fast asleep.  The sound of a vehicle stirred me awake, and I saw the glare of headlights out front through the curtains.  I immediately sat up and opened the curtains.  It was a truck that was sitting out front of the driveway and then started to drive on slowly.  I assumed it was the paper deliverer and was about to collapse back into bed when I saw them abruptly hit the breaks a few feet away from our driveway.  From their headlights, I clearly saw a figure of a man walking in front of them.  The truck stayed put for about 5 seconds after the man passed in front of them, and then sped off.  I watched, frozen, scared, wondering what the hell I was watching.  From the shallow light of the lamp out front, I could make out the person walking in our yard, and from my perspective, approaching quite quickly, and in my mind, with a purpose.  I shot outta bed, and went to the guest room that was right next to mine and looked out the window because it afforded a better, more complete view of the front yard.  There was a man standing right at the edge of the circle of light the lamp gave off.  Terrified, I woke my parents up, practically screaming and shaking.  My dad, now a wary veteran of these wake up calls, dutifully strolls out the bedroom, turns on the outside lights, and goes outside.  At the same time, I ran back to the guest bedroom to watch the figure.  As soon as that happened, I saw him retreat into the darkness, and I couldn't see him any longer.  My dad says ""He's gone,"" and groggily goes back to bed.  My mother is less convinced, and stays up and sits in the family room.  After conversing with her briefly about how I'm never sleeping again, I go back to the guest room.  Of course, the man has reappeared.  From what I could make out, from the light given off by the lamp, he was facing our house.  I march out of the room, declaring ""HE'S BACK.  Fuck this shit; I'm calling 911.""  I grab the phone, dial, and talk to the dispatcher.  Meanwhile, the man steps a bit further forward, just enough that I could see something glint in the light, something metal, something long.  It looked like a knife.  I'm explaining this as best as I can to the dispatcher -- they say they will send a policeman out to survey and asked if I wanted to give a statement or if I just want them to patrol the area.  I said that since I can't see the face, etc. or give any useful information at this point that I didn't want to give a statement or talk to the officer.  Just then, the man stepped back, and I couldn't make his image out any longer.  I stood there watching, and told the dispatcher that he disappeared.  Due to the well lit yard of our neighbors across the street, however, I was able to see that he had made his way to their driveway and was crouching up it, and then he disappeared from my sight in the massive shrubs that shrouded the front of the house.  I informed the dispatcher of this, and we ended the call.  Within minutes, a police cruiser approached.  Unfortunately, all they did was drive up and down once, no spotlight, nothing.  They stopped at the end of our street for a moment, then sped off.  A few minutes after the police had left, the neighbors across the street turned on all of their house lights (the front of the house is very open with a lot of windows).  I assumed they had heard/noticed something amiss.  At this point, it was about 4 a.m.  

My mother and I were both unable to sleep.  We kept a look out on our neighbors' houses.  In a few hours, when it was daybreak and an acceptable enough hour, we told our neighbors what we saw to warn them.  The people across the street admitted to being awaken by some noise out front and were feeling uneasy.  (They ended up removing the heavy shrubs from their yard a week later.)

The next night both of my parents loaded their gun of choice and kept it near their side of the bed.  I took a xanax with a big glass of wine.  Then I moved away anyway.  

I'll be back home next week, so after reading these stories here, some way creepier and far more dangerous of course, I started to feel a bit nostalgic and unnerved.  I don't know what the hell to make of all these experiences.  I'll never not be terrified of the prospect of a home invasion or any sort of lurker.  I'm far more conscious of this than my parents; I make sure all windows and doors are locked no matter what.  These experiences have only proved to me how important it is to do this no matter how secure you feel in your community.

1351862904.0	12igsa	"""Can I buy your shirt?"""	yellowcanary	109	17	20	"I live on a 150 acre farm bordered by state gamelands. On this particular day, my best friend Sarah was over. We were in the kitchen gearing up to bake cookies when Sarah said, ""Uh, Kari? There's some dude walking up to your house."" This is incredibly strange because our driveway itself is about two miles long and we never, ever get any uncalled for visitors. Sure enough, there's some guy cutting across in front of my house and to my front porch. My dogs are going crazy and I'm already feeling rather nervous. He had wild gray hair with an equally as wild gray beard and he was dressed pretty sloppily. He knocked on the door and started calling ""Hello!"" in the windows. I never had to deal with a situation like this before and made the stupid decision of opening the door to see what was going on. The screen door was between us and I was doing what I could to bar Rambo (my little Boston Terrier/Lab mix) from shoving the door open and attacking the guy while Stanley (my pit mix) watched with interest from the nearby couch. He said it was okay to let them out because he liked dogs and I said no because I could tell by Rambo's demeanor that she was feeling threatened by how he'd been yelling before and she typically does get territorial when new people get that close to the house without meeting her outside first.

Anyway, this guy tells me his name his name is Bobby immediately and says that he used to come out to the farm twenty years ago. I believe him because the farm was a pretty busy place back then and a lot of folks used to come out and drink and swim. I start thinking that I was a little hasty in my judgement of him when he starts going into detail about people I know and what things used to be like back then. I come outside and my friend Sarah stays inside. I start to feel a bit more comfortable and begin sharing some stories that I've heard about that time. Suddenly, the conversation takes a huge, huge nosedive. He starts telling me about his lying wife putting a restraining order on him and says something to the effect of, ""If I wanted to hurt that bitch she wouldn't be breathing."" And then he talks about his sister taking custody of his daughter from him a long time ago, saying she was lying too and ""What kinda nasty woman is that."" Not only were these subjects just awfully personal and random, but he was becoming extremely agitated as he spoke. He was sitting in one of our rocking chairs at this point and he was asking for water so I went in and grabbed a bottle, thinking that he might leave once he got it. Sarah was on the phone with her dad, an influential car dealership owner with a lot of connections, and she was telling him what was going on. He said to call the cops. I said to hold on, I was going to give him water and tell him to leave.

But he just kept on talking. He told me that he was certified crazy and in and out of mental hospitals. He said he couldn't legally buy guns anymore but that he had some in the truck he'd had for a long time and asked me if I wanted to come see them. At this point, he gesture to the lower field nearest to the road and I could see his shitty truck parked there along the old railroad bed. I told him I totally didn't want to see his guns and really, really started feeling nervous. He asked me if he could buy my shirt off of me and I told him that he could buy it for nine bucks at Walmart - it was just some Darth Vader expressions shirt that caught my eye when I was passing the men's section. I sure as hell wasn't about to strip my shirt off and give it to some random creep who wouldn't get his ass out of my rocking chair. I started making up excuses about how Sarah and I had errands we needed to run so that he would leave and he started to get up from the rocker but then just sat back down and kept talking. He started talking about some doctor he met at the mental hospital who apparently did him some wrong and he started becoming irate again. Sarah was calling me into the house and I went in. She called the police and they wanted to ask me questions. I took the phone and the first thing they asked me was if he was on bath salts - as if I would have any idea! I said I didn't know but the guy seemed really off balance. They said they'd be on their way. I hung up and went back to the screen door, knowing it'd be at least a half hour/45 minutes before they'd get there. We live so far out that a fast response is impossible.

I didn't come back outside, I just stayed by the screen door and kept squeezing in excuses for him to leave whenever I could find a break in his rantings. He kept half-rising out of the chair and sitting back down like he did before. Sarah was back on the phone with her dad who just came to realize that he knew the guy - apparently, he's some local weirdo who occasionally comes into the shop and does basically the same thing until he becomes super firm and makes him leave. We give the phone to the guy and Sarah's dad tells him, ""You need to leave, you're scaring the girls,"" and the guy walks away from the house and starts pacing, arguing with her dad and saying that he didn't do anything wrong. Sarah's dad keeps telling him that he understands but he really needs to leave. A while into this conversation, the cops rip up the driveway and start talking to him. One of them gets the story from Sarah and I and then they're both down there talking to him again.

I can hear the guy saying he wants to sit down. It's a hot day and I could see why. Anyway, he makes a few steps towards the big concrete block atop the sewer and suddenly, one of the cops grabs him, knocks him over his leg, and sends him backwards down the hill from the driveway. The guy falls on the back of his neck and starts crying. They cuff him and tell him that they told him not to move and that he needs to listen. I felt horrible because I thought that was excessive force. The guy was trying not to let the cops get a word in edgewise and kept just trying to rant the same way he did with me but they were firmer with him.

When he was in the car, the cops came to me and took an official statement. Apparently, this guy had been causing some trouble and they've been trying to get him for things but nothing stuck. They felt he was dangerous and the cop kept stressing to me that he really wanted me to go to court and take this seriously. We still haven't gotten a summons but I heard that Bobby was picked up recently for holding a young girl at gunpoint and molesting her. I really hope that he stays put away because I can't even aptly describe how wildly angry this man became at the drop of a hat - that sort of person is just not safe. I hope the best for that young girl and I'm glad that she's still alive because he's got a history of violence and he's obviously mentally unstable. I could absolutely see that he could have possibly killed her just as easily as he let her live. What's odd is that I heard even more recently that he's back out and that makes me nervous because I know he'll eventually be getting a court summons in the mail pertaining to what happened at the farm and I'm worried that it'll really piss him off and he'll be right back. I'm just grateful for the castle doctrine. I will absolutely be ready to defend myself if he comes out here all kinds of crazy. If it weren't for the right to bear arms and the castle doctrine, I'm sure I'd be long dead by the time the cops showed up if he really meant me harm.

1339169945.0	urp2h	I was nearly lured to a strange mans van because of my naïveté.	2543W	100	7	12	"When I was little I used to sing competitively, and one year I sang Stupid Cupid. I had this adorable little costume that won a bunch of prizes. One competition I had just gotten offstage and was going to meet my mom in the audience, when I saw a man behind me. I thought nothing of it at first, but eventually got a little creeped out, so I took the long way to see if he would follow. He did, and I panicked. I kept walking to the audience so I could tell my mom. Before I got there though, he jogged up to me and said ""Can I take a picture of you little girl?"" I, with my overlarge ego, saw nothing wrong with that. I relaxed. ""Okay!"" I said. He smiled and said ""I forgot my camera in my car, can you come help me grab it?"" I don't know what I would have done, but at that moment my mom came out of the audience to see where I was because I was supposed to meet her. The man saw her walking towards me and immediately ran away."	t5_2t3t8	True
1336720422.0	thv4o	The Man on the Dock	gingersaurus	101	11	22	"When I was younger, my sister and I would walk down to the park near my house to play basketball. The park runs alongside a river. So one night, as usual, we walk down to the park. Just the two of us, along with our family dog. We played basketball for a little while until we noticed it was getting dark and decided to head home.

As we start walking along the path next to the river, we notice a man standing on a dock. I felt in my gut that something was off with this guy. People would stand on that dock and look out into the water, but never so intently. He was staring angrily at the water. He saw me looking at him and stared angrily at me, as if I was seeing something I shouldn't have been. Then he looked back at the water. I told my sister to hurry up and tried to get my dog to go faster, but my dog was old and overweight and kept having to stop. I never took my eyes off the man.

We hadn't gotten much further along the path when I see him break away from whatever was he was staring at in the water. He spun towards us and started walking. His walk was a little strange. It had a robotic rigidity to it that made it seem like he was heavily medicated. My gut told me something wasn't right, so again I urged my sister and dog to speed up. I looked back. He was speeding up too. So I did what any 12 year old would do. I reached for my cell-phone and called my mom.

""Hello?""

""Mom. There's someone following us home from the park. Please hurry.""

""I'm on my way.""

I looked back. The man was still power-walking towards us. We had almost reached a field that we could cross to reach a road that runs parallel to the path. I knew we had to get to that road. The man was gaining on us because our dog kept stopping, and I did not want him to catch us on the wooded path by the river. We needed to get to the brightly lit road. We reached the field and my dog stopped. The man was still power-walking towards us, staring at us. we tugged at the leash and cried for my dog to get up, but he couldn't. The man was coming quickly, and I made a difficult choice. We left my dog and ran for the road. 

Once we reached the road, we stood there and called my dog. The man walked past my dog, and then stopped on the path in a clearing where there were very few trees. All I could see was his silhouette as he stood there with his hands on his hips. Facing us. Not saying a word. We called desperately for my dog who eventually met us on the road. Relieved, we set off towards my house once more.

So did he. He walked along the path and it became increasingly wooded. Then, when he thought he would be well hidden by the trees, he started crossing towards us. He was almost running now. I told my sister to get behind me. He emerged from the trees ahead of us and began to walk quickly towards us, he facial expression focused and unchanging. At that moment, I see my mom come around the corner behind him. She's holding a baseball bat, swinging it menacingly. He caught sight of her out of the corner of his eye and veers in the opposite direction as if nothing happened. I was so relieved I felt like crying. As we walked home, I didn't take my eyes off of him.

I wonder sometimes what would've happened if my mom hadn't arrived when she did, and what he was staring at in the water..."	t5_2t3t8	True
1332666667.0	rcj2d	[My] Buddy B	RadiatedMutant	113	22	14	"It was a Friday night, and the only reason I remember is because my girlfriend of the time and I were hanging out in the woods avoiding the crowds at the football game. We were near enough that we could still hear the announcements from the game, but far enough to not understand what was being said. It was a nice cool night, I'd abandoned my hoodie because I'm always hotter than anyone else and she'd been wearing it. I loved it because it would smell like her hair after she wore it. 

We live in a crummy little mining town and there's nothing for teens to do so most of them go to the woods on a Friday night and drink. We knew most of the places where these parties were happening but we were content to hang out alone in the near-dark. My girlfriend said she wanted to wander a bit, but I was pretty worn out from the hike up the mountain to our current spot so I decided to let her go alone. She was 16, I figured she'd be fine. 

The announcements of the game got quiet and I could hear her footsteps, but she was uphill in the dark and I couldn't see her. I'd hear her shoes crunching a bit one way and stopping, she was always into nature so I imagined she was looking at foliage and such. Then I heard a few quicker steps like something scared her, but she wasn't booking it and I figured she scared herself and then calmed down.

Then came her voice doing the whispered yell for me. That sound where your voice is raspy, you want to direct your voice at someone without alerting everyone else. She said ""Dan! Dan, come here quick!"" So I got my fatness up the hill super quick and I can see up on a higher hill there's a group of people around a fire. I figured it was a party because I could see the silhouettes of people standing between us and the fire. Then I realized they weren't facing the fire, they were facing us. When they would turn their heads you could see the fire showing on their faces and I got uncomfortable. 

Now I was a decent fighter, but taking on the 6 people I could see wasn't going to end well, let alone if there were others I couldn't see. We were looking uphill and couldn't actually even see the fire, just the light from it, so if anyone was on the other side, we wouldn't notice them until they were charging us. Then, just as I'd stopped next to her one of the spoke up and yelled ""Who the fuck is that? If you're Julian I'm gonna fucking gut you!"" And then they charged at us. 

I was basically stunned for a second at whatever was going on so all I could do was stand in front of her to keep her safe. That's about when I noticed the one yelling was carrying a nice size combat knife and he was running down the hill straight toward me. So I'd love to say I got brave and yelled at him threatening things, but I sorta peeped out ""It's Satan!"" (Everyone in high school knew me as Satan) and then they stopped. Then I hear my buddy B (We called him B, his name was Brandon) say ""Oh shit man, you gotta speak up, I was gonna kill you"". And we kinda laughed it off and he gave me a beer and then the girlfriend and I hit the road. I was told when he was drunk he'd show a lot of anger, but I'd never actually gotten drunk with him, so I figured it was just the metal-head in him coming out. I hadn't thought about it much, my friend being one for showing off as a tough guy but never following through.

A year passed and it was New Years eve. A different friend and I were in his house playing Dungeons and Dragons, when we heard a lot of sirens. Now our town loves it's little parades which seem to happen at the drop of a hat, but not this late at night, as it was about 2am. We dismissed it as maybe a fire or something, the usual shit in a little town. The next day, my buddy Brandon is all over the front of the newspaper. Apparently he'd gotten drunk with a bunch of people, one of whom being Julian. Julian had said something Brandon didn't like and Brandon stabbed him in the stomach. fortunately, he was with people that stopped him after one stab and Julian survived, but spent a few weeks in the hospital. Brandon went to jail for a few years.

This may not fit the exact schema for this subreddit, but I know now that if I hadn't gotten up enough courage to tell him who I was in the woods that night, I could have been the one bleeding. And if he had the wrong friends with him that night, no one would have stopped him at one jab."	t5_2t3t8	True
1375482794.0	1jldvw	He was waiting for her, leaning against her car.	ElleBee_	108	18	10	"True story a friend of mine told me awhile ago, thought it would be worth a share.

My friend went to California to visit her boyfriend for a few weeks. One night, he was sick so she decided to take his car and go pick him up some meds at the local Walmart. It was about 10pm when she drove over and, as she walked into the store, two guys walked in behind her. Nothing out of the ordinary, just two friends who were walking in at the same time as she was. 

So she walks around and picks up what she needs but quickly realizes that those two guys are OBVIOUSLY following her through the aisles. She doesn't think much of it. After all, she's in Walmart and there are a few customers around, plus several employees. They'll probably stop following her soon anyway.

Wrong. They keep following her. She decides to walk around and pick up a few more things in an attempt to lose them, but they just keep at it. 

She finally decides that she can't walk around the store all night, so she heads over to one of the checkouts. Sure enough, the guys follow her and line up behind her. Then, one of the guys leaves and heads back to the parking lot while the other guy waits in line behind her to pay. 

She's pretty freaked out at this point and trying to telepathically tell the cashier that these guys are following her but it obviously isn't working. And she can't say anything because he's standing right behind her. She's thinking about abduction stories she's heard and keeps repeating to herself that ""Oprah told me never to allow yourself to be brought to the second location!!"" She's mentally preparing for a multitude of possibilities.

And then, something amazing happened. The cashier asks if she needs help bringing her bags out to her car. She only had two small bags, but she definitely jumped at the chance. After she's done paying, she heads out to the parking lot accompanied by a 20-something year old guy who's carrying her bags and immediately notices that the creepy guy who had left while the other one stood in line was waiting for her, leaning against her boyfriend's car. 

Upon seeing her come out with the employee, he quickly walks away like nothing was going on and my friend safely gets into her car and quickly drives away. 

These guys could just have been creeps who were gonna attempt to talk to her, or they could have tied her up at gunpoint and thrown her into their truck. I think she was really lucky."	t5_2t3t8	True
1375224320.0	1jdr49	Late fathers day WTF	Chineserose	141	54	21	"So I work as a delivery driver for a local Chinese takeaway and one of the places I frequently deliver to is an assisted living nursing home. So I've got the order for this lady. 

   I rock up at the nursing home and after going through an electric gate approach the reception.  

   I push the buzzer to alert the nurses that I'm in the lobby and shortly after a man comes out. It quickly becomes clear from a strange sense about him that he is not a nurse but is I fact one of the patients

""Hi I've got a take away for sue,  have you seen her about?"" I ask the man casually.

""Food?"" the man replies. 

""Yeah,  take away for Sue.""

""What take away is it?"" he presses. 

""It's Chinese but it's not for you its for Sue."" I reply sensing where this is going.  

""I'm hungry."" the man states, I push the reception buzzer again. 

""It's not for you its for Sue."" I reiterate.

The man takes a step towards me and Starts saying,  ""come in and have some food with your dad,  come in and have some food with your dad"" over and over. This man is not my father.

I take a step back and he takes two steps closer so he's right up in my face still uttering the phrase ""come in ad have some food with your dad."" the man had a deranged lost look on his face which was quite alarming. 

I start backing away to my car and he starts following to the point that I actually break into a run. I make it to my car and thankfully during the chase he lost interest and I shook him.

About a minute after I go to reception again,  push the buzzer and make the delivery. 

THEN on the way out I am accosted by another guy. Here we go again I think to myself. 

The man comes up to me,  again rather close and in a low grow of a voice opens with ""my name hadn't been invented before I was born."" 

Half intrigued half apprehenciveley I say ""what's your name.""

"" My name's Michael"" he responds. 

I try not to cracking the fuck up, get in the car and drive back having done my most messed up delivery yet. 

When I get back to the Chinese I complain and say I don't want to go back because the first man was genuinely scary but in reality I go there way more now than I ever did. Never been as bad as that though.

1373490762.0	1i19ij	Out-smarted a creeper	GCB78	115	22	28	"First time submitting, so apologies if I break any rules. 

I live on a pretty populated street, in a very popular suburb, in a less-than-safe city. Usually, I have no worries about walking at night, because the streets are well lit, and there are always people around. But this one night... 

This one night. 

I had spent most of the day on the couch. I was hungover, and I didn't want to move. Around 8, I was struck by a burger craving. Not a problem. The best burger place in Joburg was just around the corner, and the streets were always busy at night. Phoned my order in, got dressed, and stepped into... a ghost town. All the restaurants on my street were closed. And the street-lights were out. Darkness. The only light came from a hair-dressing salon 2 doors down, that was obviously hosting some kind of function.

But no problem! My area is safe! I walked down the road, and hit the road where the burger place was. Freaky. Street lights are out here too. I collect my order, and as I'm walking home, some guy tries to stop me. 6ft2, crazy hat, no worries. Bitch shields engaged. I ignore him. But then, as I'm walking home... The hackles raise on my neck. I glance behind me. He's shadowing me. I know I am facing a dark road back to mine. And this dude is behind me. He's bigger than me (I'm a girl). I start to worry.But maybe I'm over-reacting? I pass one of the few restaurants that is open. Duck in. Wait for him to pass. NOPE. 

I glance out. He's chatting to a car guard. An immediate feeling of relief. I have clearly misread this situation, and that dude was just looking for his buddy. Until I start moving again. And then he slots in behind me. Even in the darkness I can track him because of the crazy hat. 

I speed up. He speeds up. I loiter, and look in shop windows. He hangs back. At this point, I know he's stalking me. I have to turn down a dark road to get home. Not just dark - there's construction happening on the road, so there are sidings and crannies. I thought about calling someone to come pick me up, but it felt a little ridiculous. So I made a plan. 

To get to my road, you have to duck round an electricity box. Big, green, blocks the view of anyone following you. I put my keys between my fingers (a makeshift knuckleduster for surprise throat-punching) The minute I rounded the corner, I took off running. Headed for the middle of the street (figured any abduction would be more noticeable if he had to wrestle me off the street). I ran until I hit the hair salon. Endured some weird looks. But when I looked back, the guy I was worried about was stepping out of the alley behind the construction siding. He looked really angry. GCB 1, Creeper 0

1366817085.0	1d0ihg	Supermarket Zealot		107	17	15	"This happened while I was at a Publix Supermarket in South Florida. I was looking for some V8 Vegetable juice when I feel a tap on my shoulder. I turned and saw a short Spanish lady probably in her late 50's or 60's. I automatically assumed she was going to ask me to get something off the high shelf for her. But instead she asks in Spanish: 

*""Do you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior?""*

I'm an atheist but I'm not vocal about it and I don't really enjoy debating people. It's a personal choice for me and I didn't want to speak with anyone about it, especially a stranger in a supermarket. Living in South Florida has taught me that this discussion would not go over well and I was better off just brushing her off. I'll note right here that Spanish is my 2nd language and sometimes my choice of words may convey a different meaning than my intent. Either way my response was simple:

*I appreciate your concern but I would rather not discuss my religious beliefs with a stranger.*

The lady doesn't accept this answer.

*If you were a follower of Jesus, you would be shouting his name and spreading the word of his ultimate sacrifice and return!*

I repeated what I said before and decided to forget about the juice. As I walked away, the lady continued to preach to me about Jesus. She followed me out of the isle and halfway down another before I turned around and told her to leave me alone. 

*You are disrespectful and you are going to end up in Hell! Why won't you accept my help?*

*I don't want or need your help. Please just leave me alone. You are bothering me.*

She followed me further attempting to speak to me. That's when I decided to leave. I had most of my items so I went to the checkout line. If she continued to follow me, I figured I could ask a manager for help. The lady followed me to the checkout line but luckily she went to the express lane. I paid and went out to my car. 

As I loaded up my bags, the lady came up behind me and grabbed my arm pretty hard. It didn't hurt but it took me by surprise. She tried giving me some pamphlets from her church but I refused them and continued to try to load up my car. She tried to grab my carton of eggs and bread but I swatted her hand away. I finished loading and got into my car. The whole time she was begging me not to leave, offering to pray with me, and asking me to stop and listen to her. 

I got into my car, turned the engine on, and put it into reverse but the lady stood behind my car so I wouldn't be able to leave. There was a car parked in front of me so I had no escape. I honked my horn and she still wouldn't get away from the car. I shouted at her out the window to move and still nothing. She began placing the pamphlets under my rear window wiper. That's when I had enough. I called the police on my cell phone.

When the police arrived, the old lady began to question them about their faith as well. When they asked her to move away from my car, she refused and told them that she had to save my soul. After refusing them two more times, they grabbed her and escorted her away from my car and into their police car. She screamed at them to let her go and kept babbling about being on a mission from God to save souls. She condemned them to Hell several times before they closed the door to their car. The policemen came over and took my statement. After we finished, he told me that this was the third time she was being detained for harassment. I commented that she needed some help and then I went home.

1364783265.0	1be9i2	The Italian Chronicles, Part One: Pepper Spray	sigsigsmash	110	20	15	"
Hi folks.  Here are a few stories from my time in Italy several years ago.  I am a 5' 10” female with light colouring, so I stood out like a sore thumb in Rome, where I was living.  In case you are unfamiliar with Italian culture, it is not uncommon for foreign girls to get pretty heavily creeped on, verbally harassed, followed, and generally bothered by overzealous men.  
These are my experiences.  Thankfully they aren't too traumatic, and I turned out just fine.  

The first story takes place in one of Rome's busiest nightlife hot spots, and a place where my friends and I frequently went to hang out and drink.  I was a pretty reckless teenager, and I had just graduated from a sheltered, strict boarding school and moved to Italy by myself.  Naturally, I thought I was badass, streetwise, and invincible, and didn't give a single solitary fuck.  

So moving on.  My friends and I are at a bar, all female exchange students in our late teens and early twenties.  We get some drinks at the outdoor service window and start talking to some of the other patrons, a few Italian guys our age.  They seem nice enough, and we are merrily chatting away, when I notice a creepy guy—mid-to-late thirties, grizzled stubble, muscular build, with a scary-looking studded leather jacket and boots.  He was standing away from the crowd, watching my friends and I.  Just staring.  Now, this is pretty common behaviour towards young blonde foreign ladies there, so we just ignored him and continued having a good time.  I didn't see him any more after a while so I figured he just went off to creep on someone else.  
The guys we were talking to had some hash, and even though it was a crowded public square, there was this big statue in the middle of it where everyone went to sell and smoke hash with no incident.  We were all chilling at the base of the statue, passing the joint and chatting, when I notice the guy again.  He is sitting directly behind one of my friends, just staring.  Not saying a word or moving a muscle.  He did this for about five minutes, and then moved on to my next friend.  My pals were just ignoring him and giving him uncomfortable looks.  One of the sassier ones told him to buzz off, but none of them spoke Italian, so they just tried their best to pretend he wasn't there.  

He stood next to every single one of my friends like that (there were five of us), just staring, for five to ten minutes at a time.  The guys we were talking to told him to get lost, but were morons and far too absorbed in chatting up my friends to take any real notice of some random weirdo in the public square (there wasn't exactly a shortage of oddballs there to begin with; strange behaviour was generally ignored unless it escalated).  Anyway, it gets to my turn, and being the nippy little radgie that I was, I confront him.  The following conversation happened in Italian, so none of my friends knew what we were saying.  

Me:  What are you looking at?

Creeper: *no reply*  

Me:  If you don't get away from me, you won't be able to look at me much longer.  

Creeper: *no reply*

Me:  *pulls out pepper spray* Do you know what this is?  Cos it sure the fuck ain't gonna freshen your breath.  What do you want from me? 

Creeper: (in a very, very quiet whisper, definitely the most bone-chilling part of the whole ordeal)  I want to violate you.  

Me:  Excuse me?  What the fuck did you just say?

Creeper:  I SAID I WANT TO FUCK YOU, YOU FUCKING BITCH!!!

Just as he started screaming he lunged forward, grabbed my collar with one hand, my crotch with the other as hard as he could, and pressed his nose against mine.  
I lost it.
I pushed him back with all my weight, and whilst he was off balance I filled his eyes with pepper spray.  He turned his face to the side, and I followed, giving him one last blast in the eyes and nose, and spitting on his face.  Then I backhanded him, hard, and hauled ass to the nearest bar.  There was a cover to get in, so I explained to the bouncer what had happened and that I needed to wash the pepper spray off my hands.  He let me and all my mates in, no questions, no cover, and called the cops. The guy was taken away, in agony, to the hospital.  Because pepper spray was illegal there at the time, I put up my hood and booked it home before anyone could identify me to them. 

TL:DR  A crazy guy creepily and wordlessly followed my friends and I, at close range, all night, culminating in him screaming that he wanted to fuck me and grabbing my crotch as hard as he could.  I pepper spray him and GTFO. Good guy bouncer gives refuge to my friends.

1364351218.0	1b33rw	Stranger in a supermarket	gabyfoxx	115	27	13	"I was about ten years old at the time, and I went out to get a few things at the local supermarket with my mom. Things went as normal, and then we get to the cash register and realize my mom forgot the croutons. Me being an overly energetic 10 year old, I ran to the end of the store to try to get them before my mom finished checking out.

This supermarket was generally empty, being that it was quite late at the time. I ran down the aisles trying to find where the croutons were, as focused on my mission as possible. I just went through every aisle scanning the shelves.

I get to near the end of the store when I notice a man who seemed huge at the time (Can't pinpoint a specific height due to being ten years old and incredibly short, so everyone seemed huge) following me. I figured I was being paranoid because even though I was young I did get freaked out pretty easily, so I ignored it. He seemed like a tougher version of the average joe, bald, tall, but incredibly muscular. He was on the phone so I just ignored him a bit more.

Scanning a few more shelves my paranoia just wouldn't stop bugging me, so I decided to take a few turns through the aisles and see if he followed. He did.

I *again* just tried to ignore it, until I listened in on what he was saying on the phone.

**He was describing me.** Height, skin color, hair color, body features, he pointed out sexual features as well-my ass, my thighs, he described how I walked, what I was wearing, I was terrified. Was he gonna kidnap me? Kill me? Rape me? Was I gonna see my parents again? I couldn't tell if I was just paranoid again or if any of those threats were real. I remember scanning the store to see if anyone was around and I could stand by them or something, and as my mind processed this, I remembered every bit of advice my parents had given if encountered with a situation like this. Scream, yell, make a scene. But I just couldn't do that.

I just quickened my pace to test him once more, and he quickened his. I turned around to take another look at him and saw the expression on his face as his eyes were set on me and I just ran. I ran faster than I'd ever run before and I didn't stop until I reached the cash register my mom was at.

She asked me where the croutons were, and I just said I couldn't find them. She offered to go back and get them herself. I said no, and that we should just leave.

I never told anyone that. I don't know why, I should've told my mom something, told my dad something, or said something at the spot because god knows if that guy ever did end up snatching a kid at a grocery store. It wasn't until I was 15 that I told my mom what happened.  


I was 10. I was 10 fucking years old. Even today I wonder what would've happened if I didn't run that instant, and had just ignored him. "	t5_2t3t8	True
1347127323.0	zkbao	Encounter on the back roads	hanncamp	159	68	31	"This happened about 3 years ago when I was a senior in high school. My (now ex) boyfriend and I were in the car. We went to meet another couple at the movies after a basketball game just to kill some time. 












We were all bored and none of us wanted to go home. We went to the 10:30 showing of Dear John (which by the way I fell asleep in. I didn't care for romantic movies much and the only good part had to be Channing Tatum.) Anyways...the movie ended and we all piled into our cars. I had to take my boyfriend home because he didn't have his license yet. 



















I hated the back roads but they were much quicker than going through town and most likely being stopped at every single red light. He lived out in the middle of absolutely no where. We were about five minutes away from his house when my headlights revile a young woman standing in the road frantically waving her arms flagging me down. 






















It's about midnight at this point and I'm wondering if maybe possibly her car broke down. I felt nothing wrong with this situation so I pulled over to the side of the road. I might want to mention in advance that I am so fucking stupid for doing this. She rushes up to the car and asks if we can give her a lift. She tells us that her boyfriend and her got in a fight and he forced her out of his car and she was walking home. She still had about 10 miles to go. I felt bad for her but I was still suspicious. I told her she could use my cell phone if she needed to and then made up the excuse that I didn't have enough gas to get her where she wanted to go. She said she would give me money and then out of nowhere she starts looking at me and smiling. She kept repeating things like Oh my god! I know you!! I remember, don't you remember me?! I have never before seen this woman in my whole life. She kept saying things like how could you refuse a ride to someone you know?? I'm not a stranger! I only had my window cracked about three inches at this point and when I kept refusing her a ride she got angry and cursed at me calling me all kind of names. She reached in the car and tried hitting me I rolled the window up and caught her fingers in the window between the frame and the glass. She screamed. I unrolled it enough so she could remove her fingers and quickly locked my doors before she tried that.























Out of nowhere a man comes out from the wooded area next to the road. This guy was huge. He looked like a security guard that you would see with like Beyonce or something protecting her from the paparazzi. I was frozen. My boyfriend slowly took his cell phone from his pocket and dialed 911. He hit my hood and demanded I get out of the car or he was going to pull a gun on me. I snapped back into reality and put my car in reverse. I swerved around the man and woman as tears were pouring out of my eyes. The adrenaline had finally gotten to me and I realized we had just gotten out of something that could have been a very awful ending for us. 























We reached my boyfriends house and waited for the police. They took our information and we told them what happened. They made their way back to the spot and found burlap sacks, a gun, a knife, rope and a camera. They also found tire marks where a car had been parked in a wooded area. 


















What did they want with *us*? I most likely will never find out. This has to be the scariest thing that has ever happened to me. But I am so happy I got out safe and alive. Thanks for reading!"	t5_2t3t8	True
