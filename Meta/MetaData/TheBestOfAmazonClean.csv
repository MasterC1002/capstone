(Ends June 8th, 2013)	coconutwaters	320	79	537	"First off, thanks to all of our subscribers for helping us get to this point! We never thought at first that this subreddit would ever get the point it's in now, but all of you have made this possible. It's been tough keeping the quality of the subreddit up, having ""best of"" items all day, every day can be quite consuming, it usually takes a long time to find an item now that we think is eligible as a best of item. With that being said, we are still going to give it our 100% to find the best products on amazon, and encourage everyone to post items they think are worthy too! :) 



***


So...now on to the fun part of things. The mods and I have decided to save up for a few months, and pool up a cool $400 prize pool for all of our lucky subscribers. There are going to be TWO giveaways. I'll explain the first one here:



***Giveaway #1: $300***

**1st &amp; 2nd place**


* 2x $35 Amazon Gift Cards


**3rd to 13th place**



* 10x $15 Amazon Gift Cards (For any country, amazon.co.uk, .ca etc)


**13th to 33rd place**



* 20x  1 month Reddit Gold






Comment here what do you **personally** think is truly the best amazon product? Give a link and a quick description. This doesn't necessarily mean it's the best product for everyone, but explain why it's been the best product ***FOR YOU***. This gives a lot more room for other, non popular products to be mentioned, and not just everyone naming the top 10 best sellers on amazon. A lot of amazon links get automatically spammed, so your post may be in que in the spam filter for a few hours. I'll be checking back regularly to approve links. When we choose winners, we will be looking at things like: Upvotes, recency of the posting etc. So just because you post 5 days from now, that does not make you as less eligible to win than someone who posted early. We will also be choosing 5 or so random winners for reddit gold.



***

***RULES***

* Comment post must only contain an amazon link, along with a short description (or long if you like) of why you think it's the best product on amazon for you.

* If you already have Reddit Gold, and win a Reddit Gold prize, you have the choice of either a $3.99 Amazon Gift card, or another month of reddit gold to be stacked on to yours.

* Maximum of 2 entries per user.

* No flaming, no trolling etc. Be nice and respectful!

* No tags in amazon URL's, make sure to wipe out any tags in the amazon URL if one exists. (This can be done by deleting &amp;tag= in the url, and anything after it).


***

As for our second giveaway, it is going to be held on our official facebook page **[(Click here to visit and like)](https://www.facebook.com/TheBestOfAmazon)**. All you have to do is be a liked member of the page, and you will be eligible for our giveaway! On June 8th, 2013 we will choose 20 random lucky winners off our page, and display the winners on the facebook page itself.



***Giveaway #2: $100***



* 20x $5 Amazon Gift Cards




***DEADLINE (For both giveaways)***

* The winners will be chosen on June 8th, 2013. Exactly a week from now.




With that being said, I would like to thank all of you for all the positive feedback and attention that you have gave to our subreddit. I've met a ton of great people here, and have learned quite a lot since day one. Good luck to everyone!

&gt;* [ASTRO Gaming A50 Wireless Headset](http://www.amazon.com/ASTRO-Gaming-A50-Wireless-Headset-Nintendo/dp/B0091WIOJ2)
