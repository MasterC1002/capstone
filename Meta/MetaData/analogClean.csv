**Please note:** this is in no way the end all be all. I am not a pro. This info has been collected from sources on the Internet, and thus YMMV. So if you have suggestions (like timings/temps/materials) please let me know and I'll fix the mistakes or add any additional info.

**Things you will need:**

* [Tetenal C-41 kit](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/109267-REG/Tetenal_T109306_C_41_Press_Kit_for.html) - This whole tutorial is tailored for this kit. Kits come with manuals so you should read those too.

* [Film developing tank](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/122936-REG/Omega_455031_Universal_Developing_Tank_with.html)

* [Changing bag](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/bnh/controller/home?O=orderHistory&amp;A=details&amp;Q=&amp;sku=70983&amp;is=REG)

* [Thermometer that can measure above 40C](http://www.amazon.com/IRXL220-ProAccurate-Insta-Read-Large-Professional/dp/B000A3L614/ref=cm_lmf_tit_3)

* [Containers for the chemicals](http://www.freestylephoto.biz/5141-Arista-Air-Evac-Bottle-1-Liter?cat_id=1603)  or [alternatively bottles](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/315918-REG/Photographers_Formulary_50_1200_Amber_Glass_Bottle_with.html) - 3 should be enough, 4 if you have separate bleach and fixer

* Timer - timing needs to be accurate, so download an app or use a stopwatch

* [Some clips to hold the film while it dries](http://www.amazon.com/OXO-Good-Grips-Clips-2-Pack/dp/B0002YTG4K/ref=cm_lmf_tit_5) - [one more link](http://www.amazon.com/Universal-Large-Binder-Capacity-Silver/dp/B0016P6L1U/ref=cm_lmf_tit_6)

* [A funnel](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/63608-REG/Yankee_YAFF16_Filter_Funnel_16_oz_with.html) is always handy

* A large-ish sink

**Preparing the chemicals:**

Quick note - colour chemistry is toxic. So don't use your kitchen sink for developing, don't leave the bottles laying around where kids/people can knock them over. Also, LABEL your bottles or you might ruin your film when you pour the used developer into the blix bottle and vice versa. Make sure the room has good ventilation.

If you get any on your hands, wash them right away. Do not inhale the powder.

The Tetenal kit contains 4 packets of powder chemistry. 

* **Temp: 43.5C**. Put the developer powder into ~800ml of warm water and mix until it is dissolved, while adding more water to go up to 1L. Stir until it is clear.

* **Temp: 43.5C**. Bleach and fixer in one. BlixA and BlixB get mixed together and combined they make 1L of blix. Mix BlixA with 800ml warm water and then add BlixB and as much water as needed to go to 1L (you won't need to add much water after BlixB). Stir well until you can see through it. It smells bad.

* Mix the stabilizer powder with 1L of room temp water. Stir until it's clear. 

* The chems don't last too long - a couple of weeks or so. So shoot lots of film. Also, make sure to not leave the bottles open - close them at each step.

**Developing:**

Note: temperature control is crucial. Also, the developing times are usually the same for most type of film - 3:30.

* Put a large pot in a sink and fill it with hot water. Put your developer bottle and your blix bottle in the pot. Leave the water running so it is overflowing - this way it won't cool off. Put the thermometer in the developer bottle. **The target temp is 39C**. If you miss the target, you will need to cool off the water.

* You may or may not want to pre soak the film (after you have loaded it into the tank in the changing bag). This will help with temp control as the cool film won't reduce the developer temp. Dump the water out of the tank when ready - the water may be coloured and this is fine.

When the temperature is right, you are ready to start:

* **Step 1**: pour the developer into the tank and start the timer. Avoid placing the tank on a cold counter, rather, put back in the water between agitations. Agitate every 30 secs. When you reach the 3:30 mark, pour the developer back into its bottle. The developer can be re used for about 12 rolls.

* **Step 2**: Now pour in the blix. The temp range you want is 35C-40.5C, but try to be accurate. Agitate for 30 seconds and then 10 seconds every minute for 6:30. At that time, pour the blix back into its bottle.

* **Step 3**: Remove the top of the tank and wash the film with warm water for about 3 mins.

* **Step 4**: Put the stabilizer in the tank, agitate for 30 secs and leave it for a minute after which return the stabilizer to its bottle. To avoid water marks, put PhotoFlo in the stabilizer - 5ml for 1L.

* **Step 5**: Leave the film be, do not rinse off the stabilizer. 

* **Step 6**: Dry the film. Use the clips to weight it down from hangers.

If you have any suggestions please comment!

Item List:

* [Developer](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/568019-REG/Ilford_1131778_Ilfosol_3_Film_Developer_for.html) - chemical that makes the image appear on the negative

* [Rapid Fixer](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/253198-REG/Ilford_1984253_Rapid_Fixer_Liquid_500ml.html) - chemical that makes the developed image permanent

* [Wetting Agent](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/25041-REG/Ilford_1905162_Ilfotol_Wetting_Agent_Liquid_.html) - chemical that prevents any drying marks on the developed film

* [Developing Tank](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/122936-REG/Omega_455031_Universal_Developing_Tank_with.html) - where the chemicals will interact with your exposed roll of film

* [Film Clips](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/82605-REG/General_Brand_NP99FC_Stainless_Steel_Film_Clips.html) - for hanging the film after it has been developed

* [Mixing Cups](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/101851-REG/Delta_12110_Mix_Up_Cup_Set_of.html) - for measuring the chemicals

* [Changing Bag](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/bnh/controller/home?O=orderHistory&amp;A=details&amp;Q=&amp;sku=70983&amp;is=REG) - if you don't have a completely dark room you'll need one of these for getting your film into the tank

For me this ended up being a little over $100.

1361639960.0	1933mf	Is shooting film becoming a theme itself, allowing mediocre content? Medium/Subreddit thoughts. 	angelbaums	46	14	27	"It seems like (I have fallen for this also) images being taken with film cameras are now acceptable for what they are, but not particularly their content. Yes, good content on film is upvoted, and bad is downvoted. I think it doesn't matter what the medium is, but the content of the image. I think we should focus on taking great pictures that happen to be taken with a film camera using film, rather than film pictures with objectionable content.

I don't think shooting with film should allow us to be comfortable with using that as a excuse to take bad pictures. I think film should be another medium along with digital. 

In this subreddit, maybe I isn't too much to ask for a little evolution in content, pushing the envelope, taking planned shots, long exposures, photo essays and projects. I love gear posts and even regular posts, and upvote all, but lets make some magic happen here.

I know I am working on two projects in film right now, that I will be posting in the coming weeks and months. Even collaborations, competitions or projects within the subreddit I would like to see happen. 

Mods, maybe you can cook some of the above things up, or maybe this post can get it going as I see this group right now as having little direction.

##General Double Exposure Tips

When taking a double exposure, the general rule is to underexpose your image by one stop for each ""frame"".  Four exposures would need an underexposure of two stops for each image and so on.  This will get you a ""proper"" final exposure, but this of course will vary depending on your subjects and general lighting situation.  
You can also adjust the exposures to make one image more prominent than the others.  For example, underexposing the first image by only a half stop and the second by 1.5 stops will make the first image more prominent.

###The Accidental (non-automatic film advance) Multi-Exposure.

Medium Format cameras that have roll film holders and toy cameras like the Holga lack the ability to keep you from accidentally exposing the frame a second time or more.  With these cameras, a double exposure is rather simple, all you need to do is trip the shutter again.
In this shot from my [Mamiya Super 23](http://i.imgur.com/gAdQ012.jpg), I forgot whether I'd advanced the frame or not.  

**Camera:** Mamiya Super 23 with a 6x7 film back

**Film:** Fuji Reala 100

###Film Rewind Release Technique

On SLR's like the Pentax K1000, there are two options for double exposures.  The first involves the film rewind release button on the bottom of the camera.  You press the button, keep a little tension on the film rewind and then advance the film to the ""next frame"".  Theoretically, the film should stay in place, however I've never been able to do it correctly, and so my frames would overlap slightly, like [this](http://i.imgur.com/D8H7Gpi.jpg), which was three frames all overlapped.

**Camera:** Pentax K1000 doing reverse lens macro

**Film:** Rollei Digibase CR200 cross processed

###Reshooting a roll of film
The second way you can do double exposures and the popular way for film swaps is to reshoot an entire roll.  When rewinding, make sure not to rewind the leader into the canister unless you have a retrieval tool.  I've heard that marking where you load the film will help increase your ability to keep the frames from overlapping, but I haven't tried that.  [This](http://i.imgur.com/Bi3A4ej.jpg) is my overlapping frame result from reshooting a roll of film in my Pentax K1000 that I then had cross processed.

###Dedicated Multi-Exposure Button/Switch

If you are lucky, your camera may have a switch, which allows you to take as many exposures on the same frame as you want, as long as you keep pulling the tab out.  This is obviously the most efficient way to do it, but not every camera has that option.  My best [result](http://i.imgur.com/OC38srF.jpg) from playing with double exposures came through using this switch on my Nikon F4.

**Camera:** Nikon F4s

**Film:** Ilford XP2

If I've missed anything, just ask and I may be able to give you an answer.  I don't play with double exposures all that often (I save two frames at the end of each roll if I'm not shooting a show)."	t5_2r344	True

1364238911.0	1aznwn	How does the community wants this subreddit run?	zzpza	31	4	56	"Myself and the rest of the moderators of this subreddit have been in talks for a while since the two initial moderators (including the founder) resigned a little while ago.

We all want to help build this subreddit into a wealth of knowledge, with inspiring film photos and keeping the friendly atmosphere. We'd also like to encourage more in depth discussion whilst still being beginner friendly, and without discouraging people from posting content.

To that end, we have a few ideas that we would like feedback on. Specifically we are thinking about introducing weekly / monthly threads, such as:

* Weekly 'Ask Anything About Film Photography' (for questions that you don't think are worth starting a whole new post for)
* Monthly 'First Roll of Film' (for your first roll of film with a new camera, lens, film or even your first roll of film ever - technical details such as camera, lens and film would be required)
* Monthly 'Gear Photos' (just got some new gear you are dying to show people?)

Once the 'ask anything' posts have been going for a few weeks, this would then be used to create an FAQ to put on the wiki.

With consistent post titles, people with RES would be able to filter out these posts too, if they desired.

We've created a [Flickr group](https://www.flickr.com/groups/redditanalog/) for people to add photos to, and to act as a gallery for the subreddit.

Would switching to a self post only format (where external content is linked to in the text or comments) help in creating a discussion?

Questions, comments and suggestions please. Let us know what you want from this community. :)

___________________________________________________________________________________
Edit (post 18hrs old) - There seems to be a lot of positive comments and discussion about the way forward for this group, so we thank you all. I haven't seen any negative comments about weekly &amp; monthly threads for the topics mentioned above. I have seen a few comments about people not being interested in those type of posts, so keeping them in one place will make it easy for people to avoid them if they choose to do so. The general census seems to be that more technical detail needs to be posted with photo posts, specifically camera, lens and film. I think exposure details (and anything else) should be posted as well, but a lot of people (myself included) don't necessarily record exposure details for all shots.

We'll wait for the post to be a couple of days old to give everyone a chance to comment who wants to. Then we'll post a summary of the results and look into way to implement the top suggestions.

I would much rather have this subreddit be about the process of analog photography, questions that arise, and equipment discussion.

I feel that all the links to Flickr or personal websites add very little to that discussion, especially with the occasional vapid ""Nice shot!"" comment. Just because a picture of your cat was shot on Tri-X doesn't make it a better shot. A soulless portrait is no better on Portra than it is using a DSLR.

Being in my mid 20's I grew up in the digital age. My first ""real"" camera was a canon 20D. Over the years I made the jump from camera to camera, moving next to the 30D, the 7D and then now the 5DIII. Each time I learned a bit more and was able to push my photography with the new 'features' that each newer rig offered. Then one day it all stopped. My father came downstairs one summer during summer break and in his hands he had a mint condition SRT101 that he purchased new in Vietnam during the war. This was the moment I stopped taking pictures and began making photographs. 

I learned Sunny 16 and how to guess the light. I began composing rather than cropping in lightroom. But most importantly I learned patience. I stopped snapping at the shutter like a 4 year old with a  water gun. I took the time to compose and wait. Everything I learned after picking up a film rig transitioned. To this day I think I have more fun shooting my Bronica SQ-AM, Nikon F or SRT101. 

Having just had some shots come back from development, the feeling washed over me all again and I wanted to give a small PSA to my (and the next generation of photographers). Please, go on ebay, find a great old 35mm SLR, and start shooting film!

Could one ""season"" their developer (say, D76 or Xtol) with a few drops of their own blood? I doubt it would damage the developer. But would the DNA survive the process, and in some way be imprinted onto the film. Thinking of this as some sort of ultimate warkmark; a macabre way of literally putting yourself into your film. Of course this is all depending on if the DNA could be later identified forensically. 

Same question if one used blood AS the developer, assuming it's chemically possible (I know urine can). "	t5_2r344	True

 As I said, I'm new to photography. I decided that learning the art of photography will help me with my career ambitions to work in advertising; that and I really need a hobby. 

 So, I went on ebay and picked up a Nikon em SLR camera. Unfortunately, it only came with a body, which means I am going to have to pick up a lens and some film. No problem, I'll just use my next paycheck to pick up some of these things. I am, however, feeling a bit overwhelmed by all the lingo being tossed around.

 I am going to take a course in photography next semester, but in the meantime, I want to get to know my camera and at least, the very basics. What can you recommend? Should I just walk around and shot everything? I guess what I am asking is, as a beginner, what should I do?"	t5_2r344	True

 If you post a picture at least tell us what camera and film it was because understandably not everyone keeps notes on exposure. 

Just brought a camera at a yardsale? No one gives a shit put it in the gear thread.

Your first roll through your first camera? PUT IT IN THE THREAD FOR FIRST ROLLS.

And lastly what annoys me most of all, people are in here to improve their craft and to share something that they created. How do you improve? Through constructive criticism... sadly none of you seem to know what that means. Constructive criticism is not down voting and moving on, constructive criticism is not insulting the photographer's choice of model/gear/film/ etc. Constructive criticism is giving your opinion  on how the photographer can improve.

I wound up using a K1000 with a broken meter. It wasn't a terribly good, accurate, or versatile meter anyway. And my school even required us all to get good, expensive little Sekonics.

It was liberating.

As I've used a handheld meter more and more, in most normal lighting situations… I can just guess. I've shot manual cameras (or DSLRs in manual) for years and years, but I never really remembered the exposure info. I just made the little needle or display or LED move to the middle, and I was good. But having to take the meter, point or place it at/under something, read the exposure, and then dial it in… scenes started to get stored in my head.

Now, I can guess most normal lighting conditions. And somehow, even though I've been shooting since I was 9, I never really understood how stops related across aperture/ISO/shutter speed. Now I know 1/3rd stops, half stops, full stops across them. And I've only been using this K1000 and Sekonic combo for (not even, actually) a year.

What about tough lighting conditions? Harsh highlights and black shadows? A meter makes it easier to know how to expose! The human brain is much, much smarter than even the fanciest meter in a brand new DSLR. When you know the characteristics of your film/developer combo, and you know what makes printing easier for you (or scanning), over time you begin to know how to meter for a scene. Usually I'll meter more for midtones because I care more about how they look than data in the shadows (honestly, I like dark, almost detail-less shadows usually). But, you get to make those choices! If you want more detail in the shadows, you can meter for them.

Or if you're shooting slide film, you can make sure your highlights don't get blown.

If you have a camera with a built in meter, but you also have a handheld meter, try it out. I'm not saying you have to run out and spend $200 or $500 on a fancy Sekonic, but those buggers are fucking *accurate*. And you'll learn a lot more about exposure. It also makes working with strobes and film a *lot* easier. (Digital makes strobes too easy… it isn't fair….)"	t5_2r344	True

I’m coming to you from a place of love, and that place is Northern California. Here, a couple of my friends have designed a neat little hack for your iPhone called [Luxi](http://www.luximeter.com). It’s a sweet little attachment that fits snugly onto your iPhone and with the help of a free (or paid) app, turns the phone into an incident light meter! NEATO! :D

Since I think this is a sub for people who like to manually manipulate their photos, Luxi is a cool way to save some space in your camera bag, save some serious dough and still take beautiful pictures!

Here’s the rub: we are Kickstarting this project and it’s going live **tomorrow, Feb 21**. I’d love to get some feedback from you guys and, you know... see if anyone wants to pitch in ;)

I'm going to talk with our team and see if we can sneak in a reddit specific reward so stay tuned.

Thanks! Your friends at ESDevices

**TL;DR**: [Luxi](http://www.luximeter.com) is an attachment that turns your iPhone into an incident light meter. We are Kickstarting it tomorrow, Feb 21 and would love your feedback, thoughts, *cough*money*cough*, and to be your friend :)

**EDIT:** The Kickstarter is live! Please take a look at our page [here](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jamesflynn/luxi-incident-light-meter-adapter-for-iphone) and, should you pledge, we'd be very grateful! Thank you so much!

and some general cheats:

* lowres scans are usually enough for the flickr/ facebook and shouldn't cost more than $8 a roll
* minilabs do surprisingly good scans
* online retailers are a good indicator for film prices. don't get ripped off.
* try out sunny 16
* if you're only on 35mm, look for a cheap dedicated film scanner. especially if you're doing your own B/W."	t5_2r344	True

Hello everyone, 

I have given this some thought and have decided it would be great fun if we all did a multi-exposure project a la [""Tale of Two Cities.""](http://www.flickr.com/groups/urbandoubleexposed/)

The basic idea is this: you purchase a roll of film (we'll use color, C41 process, to make it easy and affordable), shoot the roll of film around your hometown (all 1 stop underexposed), and, when you're done, send the roll of film to the person you've been assigned. 

If you're interested all you have to do is 1) state your interest in the comments below, 2) be willing to spend $10-15 dollars ($2-3 for film, $5-7 for shipping, and $5 for developing), and understand that if you agree to participate, you must participate! If someone receives a canister of film and does not shoot it, then we've defeated the purpose and broken the cycle! 

This is how it will work (with 3 people, for example):

A-&gt;B-&gt;C-&gt;A

Person A sends his shot roll of film to Person B, who sends his to Person C, who sends his to Person A. Each person is then responsible for shooting, developing/scanning the film, and making an album to share with r/analog. 

Please let me know if you'd be interested! I will then create a roster and tell you to whom you must send your film (you can then work out shipping between yourselves). This project should be a fun way to 1) get people shooting (possibly exposing you to something never done), show different styles in r/analog, and show some cool cities we've never seen before. 

This first round will be limited to US residents only (due to shipping/time/etc). If successful, I'd be glad to include our friends overseas in the next round. 

**Edit: I'll post the ""roster"" beginning Monday, August 13.**

**Edit 2: Because of the interest from the Canadians, I've decided we'll include them, as well!**

**Edit 3:** There's been some discussion of how we go about getting the frames lined up, etc. When you send your film, please make sure the [leader tab](http://imgur.com/G7V1V) is out for the next person. CliffDavidson provided [this link](http://www.lomography.com/magazine/tipster/2011/06/21/get-the-film-out-the-canister-without-a-film-puller) if you accidentally wind it in. You should be able to listen for the leader to slip out of the sprocket holes by pressing your ear to the back of the camera as you wind. If you have an electronic camera, it may display a count down as the film winds (as on the Nikon F100), so you can ""pop"" the door at the last moment. To get the frames lined up as close as possible, you can put a piece of tape or sticky-whatever on the film. [Here's](http://imgur.com/DvX4P) an example of how I did it in my Pentax ZX-7. I simply put the sticky in-line with the right side of the ""frame/shutter"" mechanism. The person who receives my film, should line theirs up the same way. **I understand that all cameras are made differently, and frame/pull ratios will be different from maker to maker.** At least this gives us a way to get ""close"" to lining the frames up. Either way (even with overlap), the photos should be very interesting.

As per sending the film, US residents can go to their local post offices and ask for a ""small bubble mailer;"" it will cost you around $1.50, and the postage to almost any state in the continental US will cost under $2-3. I do not know about shipping to Canada, but I can't imagine it will be much more (maybe $5 at the most?). On Monday, I will PM all of you with your match up, as well as put the roster up in this thread. You will then have 1 week (until August 20) to shoot your roll of film. Then you will send your film to your assigned person and they will have 1 week to shoot their roll, develop, and post the pictures back to this thread. 

Thank you all for your interest and patience while I try to organize this project. I'm excited it has been (thus far) received very positively. 

**Edit 4:** A quick guide to exposing images correctly for multi-exposure. Each person will shoot the roll of film 1 stop underexposed to receive a correctly-exposed image in the end. The **easiest** way to calculate this is to use the ISO. Most cameras can be forced into using a manual ISO (please consult your camera guide if you are unfamiliar with setting the ISO manually). Because we will be ""layering"" 2 frames atop one another, you will need to take 2 (number of frames) X ISO# (on the film). ISO100 film will be shot at ISO200, ISO200 film will be shot at ISO400, etc. etc. Of course, if you feel more comfortable using your camera's exposure compensation dials, feel free to use those, as well!
