So, if you guys could answer a few questions that would be amazing! 

*  I go to a christian college and would like to know if they can access my medical records and if it is possible for me to get prosecuted by the school in any way (suspension, expulsion or drug testings).

* I am still on my parents medical insurance plan and would like to know if there is any way that they can see that I would have my MMJ card  .

* Are there any other risks that I should be aware of if I decide to get it? (i.e. job discrimination, any possible federal raid dangers, etc.)

Thank you so much for your time, guys! I really appreciate any feedback.

HandsomeHarvey	43	13	14	My bud was a dealer, nothing major, but of course he had a scale to measure and give out proper amounts. And his mom, who actually also smoked weed, found it and flipped out, thinking him to be a dealer. Because that was over the line for her, apparently. But he just told her that he doesn't deal, and that he uses it when he gets sacks so he knows he doesn't get ripped off.

Like back when you were younge &amp; sneaking around, or actual physically dangerous spots or unusual spots if you've smokes in them. I like this subreddit and was thinking we could have more  /r/askreddit type posts instead of just direct  help questions. 

I was wondering about other people's experiences when I remembered the time I smoked with some buddies in someone's backyard. The house was owned by an old lady and we decided to just walk into her thick yard. We would smoke up and even stick around for a while. One day she came out and we had to run out of there.

The reason I've avoided it is because I feel that without any real medical need, I would be taking advantage of and illegitimizing a well-intentioned law. To me, it means subverting something that came as a mark of societal progress, and making those who actually NEED medical marijuana look worse. I think very few people take medical marijuana seriously, and one big reason is that the vast majority (I think it's safe to say) of patients are just using it as a backdoor to legal, recreational weed. So my question is for cardholders that have put actual thought into it, not just as an easy way to get bud. Do you feel that what you do is right, and if so, how do you justify it?



I'm not attacking people with cards or calling anybody out, particularly since I don't know other people's situations. It's just an issue that I've put thought into, since I value being genuine and straight with people very, very highly, but I'm also pretty annoyed with dealers and getting things illegally."	t5_2rx97	True

After debating different types of business, we feel that this would be the best option. Not only will it be fulfilling on a personal level, but it seems like there will be a huge market in the future. So i have spent much of my free time in the past 2 weeks looking up information to be prepared for when I start this new business. When we started our current business we my brother already knew a lot of it and my brothers brother-in-law was in the business so he was also there to answer any questions we may have and he gave us heads up on problems we would likely encounter. 

Unfortunately, I don't know anyone who sells weed (legally) or operates a dispensary themselves. I myself am only well versed in the use of the product, not much of the laws to sell them. The business will be in San Diego, CA and I want to get as much information as I can before I start next year.

1349237378.0	10uww5	Cannabis IS a gateway drug, because of ignorance. Is there a place to get real information about drugs?	Thedarb	30	6	7	"If you try to google information about any drug, the hits are going to be littered with 'informative' websites. These websites, run by anti-drug groups are just full of aggressive words an scare tactics dressed up to look like facts. But it's this information that gets spoon fed to people who automatically just believe it as the utter truth.
These groups use the same words and terminology to describe everything from cannabis to heroin, lumping them all under the same flag.

When you try trees for the first time, and realize that it hasn't turned you crazy/into a junkie/dead, you start to question whether all the scary facts you've heard about other drugs are false as well. 

The one day Your dealer tells you he's out of weed but has some other drug for the same price. You go to look it up and all you find are pages and pages of 'information' about how the first time will kill you, you'll get brain damage, you will become violent and suicidal. ""This is stuff they also said about weed,"" you think ""so it must be bullshit too.""
So you go get $50 of meth from your dealer, he asks if you got a pipe and you say you don't so he shows you how to bump it. BAM.
3 days later, your house is as clean as its ever been, you think you understand everything a lot better than you do and your brain feels like its just way too open. But damn man, you could sure as shit do that again for the next 5 years straight.

Whatn im getting at is does someone know where to get actual information about drugs? Why is heroin bad? How does meth kill you? How much LSD can you take without breaking?

Not a place that actively promotes drug use, because that would just be equally as bad, but a place where people can get hard science facts to make up their own minds?
Thanks.

I've always wanted to ask /r/asktrees a question, because I have this problem, and here I am. My friend got me into smoking weed last year. At first, I thought, ""Hah, weed doesn't affect me,"" but I was very wrong lol. And wrong for a bloody good reason. I freaking love weed now, but I take it in moderation because that's just my style. Anyway, onto my story.

My friend and I have always been adrenaline junkies since we were kids. We went from doing biking shit, to parkour, to trees. But lately, he has been wanting to try more drugs, like shrooms and acid. Now, I know the arguments (lol, I've heard them all from him) and I just want to say that I'm okay with whatever *your* style is. It's cool with me, man. But my friend, he wants me to try these other drugs with him. Now, mind you, he also showed me reddit, which I think that's pretty damn cool of him. So, I know that he's not necessarily wrong in wanting to try shrooms and acid if he knows what he wants to get into. I just don't want to trip that way myself. Yeah, yeah, I know I should ""try anything new"" before making my opinion on things. But honestly, I'm fine with my weed. It makes me feel good, which I like. It's not about some ""coolness"" factor that kids get from smoking it. I dunno, you guys get what I mean. My friend is just so persistent with getting me to try other stuff though. I'm introverted enough as it is because that's me. He'll thinks I should go to parties and concerts and try harder drugs. I just don't want to. I've tried arguing with him over not doing certain stuff at times, and he gets a little pushy. I feel like he no longer understands me anymore, even though I'm trying to explain my reasoning.

I have no trees, currently, so I'm dealing with the physical/mental pain of it, but that's not the issue [However, if I sound a bit pissed, it's because I am currently experiencing waves of agonizing nausea and pain]
The issue is: I'm not taken seriously. I would like to join NORML, go to anti-prohibition meetups and rallies, etc, but I can't because I'm too young. I actually do my fucking research, unlike the rest of my ""HURRR 420 SMOKE WEED ERRYDAY"" generation, and it frustrates me that both anti-pot and pro-pot groups pretty much just pat my head and go ""Aw, isn't that precious?""

1340630998.0	vkjwj	Curiosity + observation, from an Aussie ent 	DewxXxDrops	20	4	21	"Hey guys =D


I'm from Australia and I've been noticing a lot of differences in 'ent culture' seeing as most people who post here seem to be from the states or Canada. 


Examples: 

-Bong's are also called 'Billies' here

-Bowls are what we chop up the trees in, the bit that you smoke out of is just referred to as the cone piece or C.P

-We don't use 'dank' as an adjective here, I'm still confused by what you guys mean, sometimes it gets used as a positive and other times negative =S




The main thing I've noticed here is that people always imply that a bowl is smoked between several people which is why you 'corner the edges' and offer people the chance to 'green it'. I had never heard of this until this forum. In the circles I run in, everyone packs and smokes a bowl on their own. I was thinking maybe our cone pieces are smaller or something =S
I saw someone refer to this practice in another post: *snaps* are a bowl that's intentionally packed to be killed in one hit.



**I was wondering what is more common, sharing bowls or packing snaps?**



Also, if you aren't part of the majority, what differences have you noticed culture wise?


Edit: In case it didn't make sense, billie comes from the word billycan which is a real [aussie icon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billycan#Usage_and_etymology_of_the_term)

If/when everything consistently checks out with my next couple buys, I'll feel bad and bring her cookies or something to ally my guilt for suspecting her unfairly.

1353257256.0	13eik6	I found a few grams of marijuana on the street last night-- how safe is it to smoke?	found_weed_throwaway	22	6	24	"Here's the deal.  I'm a late-20s professional working stiff and I haven't smoked pot in years. Last night, I found a few grams of marijuana on the street, in a ziplock sandwich bag.  I used to smoke in highschool/college, and it smells and looks like pretty good weed.  I think it's almost an eighth.

Anyway, I want to smoke it but my significant other thinks that I should just throw it out because it could be laced with something.  I think the chances are fairly low of that happening, but I want to check with /AskTrees.  I live in Washington, DC, and kids here sell something called ""wet""-- weed laced with some horrible drug.  From what I can tell, ""wet"" is mostly used by a poorer demographic, and I found this weed in a fairly decent neighborhood. Liquor stores here also sell some sort of fake weed (""Scooby Snax""), and I have no idea what that looks like.  I don't want to accidentally smoke ""wet"" or some sketchy fake marijuana shit.  Is there any way to tell if this weed is ""wet""?  Is there any way to tell if it has been laced with something?

KlondikeChill	15	1	12	"So here's the situation. I was at a park with a friend when we saw the cop. We (I recognize this was foolish) immediately put everything in our pockets, got up and walked off. The cop pulls up and asks why we walked off. We said my friend was late for something. He says ok, but I'm gonna have to frisk you guys for weapons. I say ok and he feels my pipe in my pocket.  He says ""this your pipe?"" (he never pulled it out of my pocket at this point). I said ""It's not a weapon, don't worry about it."" He says ""but it is your pipe."" I said ""I didn't say that"". So he pulls out handcuffs. I instinctively pull away a bit. He immediately puts me in a chokehold so I stop any sort of movement and tell him I'm no threat, I'm not trying to resist or get away, etc. He handcuffs me and walks me over to the side of the car (out of view of his dashboard cam), sticks his hand in my pocket, and pulls out my pipe. I tell him he can't do that without a warrant and he says the courts can decide that. Thing is I can't prove that he took it out of my pocket since I was off camera. He then stuck me in the back of the car, where I sat for around 20 minutes, not enjoying my [3] even a little bit. So that's it. If you have any legal advice, don't hesitate to share. Thanks y'all.

For the past 6 months we started hanging out daily. Since then, I've started noticing these changes on him, which I'm unsure if they're new or I just didn't see them before.
Anyhow, he's VERY greedy. Whenever someone mentions money or weed he starts drooling. Sometimes he also provides weed for people who don't want to go to the dealer, but what he does is take 60% of the weed he got and gives the rest on - so he basically steals other people's weed - and I fucking hate that he does that, because he used to deal me some weed! Also, a while back I had about 5g at his place, because I had some problems at home. When I asked him where it was he said ""we smoked it brah"", but we were smoking completely different weed and it wasn't close to 5g either. He also smokes most of the bowl by himself - when it comes to him it takes him 2 hours to pass it on and there's very little left for others.

He's also got these terrible, insulting, racist jokes that no one finds funny but himself. I feel so awkward when he tells a joke, because I can't even chuckle.. it just makes me sorta sad. 

He gets mad very easily. And I'm not talking human mad... No. What he gets is Satan mad, because I don't know anyone else in the world that would get THAT mad THAT easily. He starts cursing like he's got Tourette's syndrome. And he gets mad for nothing. A few examples: when someone crosses the street and he's in his car, when someone is driving more than 2mp/h below the max limit, when people don't listen to him, etc...

Anyhow, he became a terrible asshole, which bothers me to infinity. We were talking about living together next year in college, but now I'm afraid of that, because I don't want to live my life in depression.
What should I do? There's others who noticed these things on him too (other friends), but noone want's to tell him, because he will probably gets more pissed than he's ever been."	t5_2rx97	True

Hey, so I have smoked for awhile but have recently started to be more open about it and actually do it with frients. This weekend we were out with a more experienced ent who packs his pipes differently than me. This made me wonder how other people pack/smoke, what the most popular method is, and what is the best


**Summary:**
There are many ways to smoke with a pipe how do you use your pipe, what is the most popular method, and what is the best?


**Questions:**

*Tightly packed bowl or a very loose packed one? 
I pack mine tightly.

*Ground up to be small, medium, or simply not ground at all? 
I usually aim for small.

*Only light until the leaves catch or hold lighter there?
Until leaves catch usually

*Plug the side hole while inhaling or not?
I plug it

*Grinders or fingers?
I use my fingers but I don't really know anything about grinders

*Edit: Smoke the stems or not?
I only started after a friend told me that there is THC in the stem too so there isn't a point to waste it.

**Thank-you, if you can add more information that would be great!**

I can be high for like 3 days and I am only smoking one joint per session. After that I don't feel anything else than laziness when smoking. If I am smoking two joints, nothing changes. I am still not getting high. I did not try to smoke 3 joints because it would be very wasteful... 

Am I doing something wrong? I have frients who are high 24/7 (I do not want to be like that ;-)) but I don't feel anything after a couple of days... 

I did not smoke for 2 weeks before this week... 

Any help for an ent who wants to enjoy his holidays...?

Have never written anything interesting, but I've seen two funny references here on /trees recently and I wanted to put them to good use and add more. 

A little back story:
I live in Japan so obviously trees are a huge nono here. I love them, and I only get to indulge when I go back to see my friends and family once a year. The ""dankrupt"" and ""joint custody"" jokes I saw on here recently inspired me to try to write a speech to say to my friends just before we smoke. In this speech, I wanted to include as many references to trees as possible. Here's what I have so far...

""Four score and twenty minutes ago, I arrived in this humble abode of yours. I need to be thankful, though, because
being dankrupt is not a funny matter. It is a matter which we need to take seriously. Something we should face with the
most blunt of arguments. If handled correctly, it is possible to get joint custody. Now, living in Japan, I must say that
the grass definitely is greener on the other side. But I digress. In order to be reunited with Mary Jane, I plan on picking
the seeds and stems out of the opposition's argument, and simply vaporizing what they have to say. It'll seem like someone
hit them other the head with a blunt instrument, ""Bong!"" Honestly though, it feels great to be back in this great nation.
With all the different people, it really is a great salad bowl. Or of course, a melting pot, as they used to say. Every
ounce of my being is ecstatic with joy to see you all. Because the value that I place in our friendship can not be measured
in nickels and dimes. But I have to say, I really missed my bud."" 

I know it might kind of make some of you groan. If anyone has anything they'd like to add then if it's good I will add it in and try to memorize the whole thing. I'd love to give an epic speech to my friends, because they are awesome and they deserve it."	t5_2rx97	True

Note he could take my friends down if things got hairy. We left in shame thinking we were taken advantage of. With lifted our hearts accepting that we couldn't fix what had been done. Later in the night the dealers friend called us saying we might be able to get it tomorrow. This guy is normally very awesome and cuts people great deals.

anyway this guy comes in, in retrospect he was sketchy as hELL, and was acting really desperate to sell us weed and he even showed it to us in the middle of the fuckin convenient store... he said it was Sour Diesel but it didn't smell nearly strong enough for that... our dumb asses were too high to react properly and my friend even gave the guy his number, but my other friend bailed almost immediately and texted me ""he's a cop"". so i told the guy we were in a rush to be somewhere and then he started lowering his prices absurdly low--""nah dude i have an eighth on me you can have it for like $20 just take it man, here""--and then he even tried to just roll us a blunt for free. we nope'd the fuck out of there. and we realized if a cop wanted to bust stoners, he was in the perfect store to do it, and we were pretty obviously high.

I have to fly across the pacific this summer, and I don't want to be bored the whole way/not be able to sleep. So I thought of a scheme to take canna caps on the plane.

Id take these on the plane in the bottle with my legit meds and take them when I got on the plane. 

Some of you might see a problem with this plan already, however. How will he tell which pills are funky? I have a solution to this. I have two bottles of the same meds, one in a 20 mg version and one in a 10 mg version. I take both to equal 30 mg. the 20 version has two stripes, the 10 has one stripe on the capsule. So I'll take a few of the 10s, fill them with stuff, and put them in the 20 bottle and look for them when I go to take them.

I'm former military and have worked out pretty much everyday of my adult life until a bad back injury locked me into a sedentary life for the past 5 years.

During my recovery, I've recently rediscovered marijuana (the last couple of years or so) and while I've been gaining weight (from a 170 @ 6% string-bean to a 270 turd, most of the weight gain was pre-weed)

Now recently I've begun low-impact exercises to drop the rest of the weight.  Thanks to weed I'm able to get through the pain and back to something better than the sedentary life I was leading... **here's my issue**:

While I know how a bit of exercise can give you an endorphin rush (a high feeling) I'm experiencing a true ""weed"" high when I exercise beyond 30 minutes or so.  Don't get me wrong, it's great, but I also know most stroke victims describe unusual bliss before they stroke out so I just want to be sure this is okay.

We also had about 50 grams on us because we were bringing some of it to them. Well my mom, trying to be nice, decided to clean out the car that we were going to take. The same car we had kept all of our shit in. The finds the backpack full of all our paraphernalia, and 50g's of pot. She flips. She was crying and saying that she was a horrible mother and now I'm probably never going to be able to see that friend again. I was just wondering if anyone had any advice on what I should do and/or say to her to calm her down. I've already stated every single pro fact that I have and she's just still so against it. I also have to start smoking at home in private too, so any tips about that would also be greatly appreciated. Thanks for your help, and remember, don't be stupid.  	t5_2rx97	True

I brought my bong and all the other stuff, when I spot the bong I had left at his place about 4 months ago. 

The weird thing was that there were fucking algae at the bottom. He said he hadn't changed the water in 4 months and had stored the bong on the balcony outside.

Now, in an effort to get rid of the algae, I poured some of my bong cleaner in and then let it sit for about an hour. It got rid of most of it fortunately, but there's still a layer of algae I just can't get rid of. I've tried more of my bong cleaner, some rubbing alcohol with salt, even some hand sanitizer, all to no avail.

So, what the hell do I do to get rid of the plants growing in the bottom of my fucking bong??!!

Edit: http://i.imgur.com/yQG3A.jpeg
Here's a pic. You can see that almost all of it has gone away, but there's still a layer that I can't get rid of, I don't know if you can see it in the picture.

How do I prevent 2nd hand smoke from getting to me (details inside)	Targetonmyuniform	14	5	11	"Okay so first off I know r/trees is for weed smokers but spice was synthesized as an alternative for it so I thought you guys may know more about this.

 I have also smoked weed heavily when I was younger so this is not just some paranoid woman asking about how drugs are bad mmkay?

Alright now on to the elaboration!

So we live in a house split up into a few apartments. We own the whole top floor while the bottom half is split into two smaller appartments, about two months ago the people right below our bedroom moved out and some new couple quickly moved in. 

For the past two months at night our bathroom that's connected to our bedroom has been filled with this bad smell; like some crappy cooked oriental dish and its the same smell every night!

At first we wondered if it was some drug but it really smelled like some strange food so we ignored it. 

Last week while in my bedroom doing nothing I felt a sudden adrenaline rush, nothing new, whatever. Then I started to smell that smell again. The adrenaline rush made me feel really wired and it lasted all night through sleep and over my work shift the next day (slept only thanks to NyQuil). I checked my blood pressure at the store on a win after work and it was really high, kind of freaked me out. 

For a few weeks before that I've been having horrible migraines. Me and my fiancé find it harder to breathe in our apartment as the weeks go by. 

To the point: my landlord asked me to call her and she asked me if anyone in my place smoked and i told ber no, then she said some tenant that lives there is on probation and can't be around drugs. I then brought up the strange smell (btw our bathroom has no venalation whatsoever and its heated by gas). She said the other people were complaining about the same thing. 

Ion a hunch I asked a co worker what spice smells like. She described it and it did the smell perfectly!

God it really explains how we have been feeling lately and to boot. The people downstairs were pretty much accusing us of smoking (the third tenant lives on the other side of the house, nowhere near where the smell came from. 

Sorry for the wall of text but how should I go about this? If t was weed I would not care at all as I actually like the smell but that chemical spice shit is getting to us now.

sorry about the ramble but my question is, is it really that easy to clear out a room of weed smell? and if i do smoke in my room, how long will it take to get rid of the smell? also methods of getting rid of the smell.

I'm paranoid that my most recent gram I bought and smoked was laced with something. The reason I'm paranoid is because I know weed is not a hallucinogenic, but I had a strange experience the latest time I smoked. I smoked about three bowls total (the most I've ever smoked) and my imagination seemed to bleed into reality. The best way I can describe it is that I thought, ""what if there was a city outside my window?"" and out of the corner of my eye, outside my window I saw a city, but I knew it wasn't real. When I looked at my window head-on, the city disappeared.

Basically, I'm wondering if the weed was laced or if I was just really high? Any opinions are welcomed and appreciated :)

1368258436.0	1e4biq	Has anyone experienced anything like this before?	o0marshmellow0o	14	4	13	"One night I went to a birthday party with some friends. I was drunk but not overly so. I had some anxiety so I pulled a friend(1) to the Toking room to take a hit or two from my pipe, however when we arrived there was a man about to load up a bong.  I didn’t really want to use a bong but I thought it would go against stoner etiquette to refuse so I chipped my stuff and we filled the bowl with a mix of his and my stuff. I refused the first hit since I recall that being the most potent but got the second hit, and that was enough. My friend(1) that I pulled along was drinking heavily that night but she insisted that she would be fine also took only one hit. The other two people in the room kept toking however.

When we got up to leave I realized something was not right, we were talking to friend(2) and friend(3) when I decided to pull friend(3) aside. We went by the front door, I was having a really hard time trying to figure out how to talk. I asked her to bring me to the hospital, she kept asking what was wrong but I kept saying ‘I cannot’ because I couldn’t remember how to talk. Not long after this nice lady I met that night came over and I just collapsed without warning  thankfully she caught me and ended up dragging me to the couch all the while saying that I was like a ‘dead weight’ and I was like a dead weight. I could not move because I could not remember how to move. I thought I was dying. On the couch I realized the depth of what was forgotten: how to move, how to talk, what my bedroom looked like, where my mother lived, what my mother looked like, and everything else it was just gone. No matter how hard I tried I could not conjure up the memories, I thought I was dying. Everything was starting to fade, and I knew my breath was shallow.

I remember thinking ‘Fuck this. Dying at a house party like another no name junkie having no impact upon the world, I will not go out like this’ (Mind you I am not a junkie, I smoke weed once or twice a week and at  party like events that make me anxious). It wasn’t long after that determination that everything stopped fading, friend(4) and owner of the house came to check up on me. I remember him checking my pulse stating it was okay, he asked me to look at him but I still couldn’t remember how to move so he stated I was unresponsive, and I remember friend(3) explaining how I asked to go to the hospital. I would like to note that I do not know how long I was on the couch or how much time passed between what I remember. I recall the sense of pride when I could move my eyes to look around and control my breathing, I was trying so hard to regain control of my body to show them I was conscious and I understood what they were talking about. 

Once I had control of my eyes I was able to notice that people I knew would poke their head in through the door to check up on me, but I do not recall if anyone other than friend(4) actually talked to me. Friend(4) actually helped me immensely to regain both control and memories by asking about my snake bites (it is quite the story) which instigated a chain reaction. With some pain in my head I was hit with clarity I remembered I had snake bites, when I got each side done, how I kept losing the piercings, and I finally remembered how to talk. Everything came flooding back and I just wanted to tell everyone everything because I felt so much pride in recalling my memories. I was still having some difficulty grasping walking or perhaps I was just afraid to move a lot and talking was still difficult due to a severely dry throat, I do not remember if I ever received the water I asked for. Anyways, at one point I moved my arm from an uncomfortable position, as I held it up I remember looking at it and realizing: that it is my arm, that I am wearing bracelets, I am wearing clothing, etc.

Again I don’t know how much time passed, but friend(2) and friend(3) came to get me moving because friend(1) had apparently been puking the entire time and refused to move from the owner’s bed which was making them a bit upset. I never felt like puking before, during, or after the episode not even a little. When I sat up my head throbbed, I had to wait for that to pass before I put on my shoes which I had no issue with, but when I stood up my knees and legs shook which has never happened to me before. I managed to take a step on my quaking legs before I fell/sat back down on the couch, people kept offered to help but I refused I wanted and needed to walk out on my own. It was not long before I was in the vehicle and when we arrived at my house I was hit with some more head pain but was being rushed out friend(3) kept tapping the window waiting for me to exit the car. I easily crawled out and walked with no issue to my door.
Now, I thought I remembered everything that happened that night quite clearly, but friend(1) who is known for blurring the truth sometimes claims I was carried/helped out of the house while we were leaving. It made me realize that I don’t actually remember if I walked out on my own or not, and some other things which I have already stated.

I have no idea what happened, I have never experienced anything like it before. Someone said I may have half blacked out which I don’t know if it is possible or what blacking out is like, but apparently you function alright in that state but just don’t remember anything. Someone else said I may have ‘greened out’ which again I have never done, I have drank and toked with my pipe before with no issue but a bong does get you higher and mixing alcohol with weed does amplify some affects(effects?), and I haven’t heard any stories of ‘greening out’ really other than friend(4) who apparently did just that the week before and had to crawl from the bathroom to the kitchen. While I talked to my brother he is convinced I didn’t black-out and has never heard of ‘greening out’ before. Now, friend(1) claims that the guy we toked with was doing an experiment with crushed roofies in his weed, but he and the other person in the room smoked more than us and was completely fine, furthermore I believe he said that the weed was sitting in the room which means it was the owner’s stuff. However, it did get me thinking that it is possible that my drink may have been roofied since I did lose track of it for a bit (during the lighting of the cake and singing), but I doubt anyone there would have done that since I knew most of them and the house was small enough that if someone were to try and take advantage of me they would have been caught.

Has anyone experienced something like this before? Is greening out a thing?

TLDR: Sorry, but I feel that the details are necessary to express both the symptoms and to show how much I remember compared to what I do not. Even if I tried it would probably end up being just as long.

Long story short X2, I ended up flushing it because I was 99% sure that it was sprayed with something potentially harmful.

It was very harsh, and I'm pretty sure I heard it crackle and fizz. SO I looked on the inside of my rag-tag pipe, and saw this: http://imgur.com//FeVPm3v . Now, that looks like resin, but it appeared after a single hit of a 0.05 bowl. I don't see how that much resin can come from that little amount. It smells strange, and is very strong.

I plan on using it to conceal the smell to be a bit safer while smoking in my dorm room, in addition to other safety precautions. Anyway here are my plans: Get a two liter soda bottle and fill it halfway with some form of activated carbon- the same carbon used in a carbon filter for a bong. The second half I would probably fill with some sort of dryer sheets to neutralize smell even more as well as absorb some of the smoke.

I have a few questions about this plan though. Is a two liter bottle too big? I know it would mean A LOT of carbon and dryer sheets so I have been considering maybe a Gatorade bottle. A larger mouth opening would be an added bonus to using a gatorade bottle. I just want to make sure its as effective as possible. 

Also, I have made spoofs out of toilet paper rolls before which let the smoke pass all the way thru and escape on the other side. If I use a bottle would it be a good plan to poke/burn some holes in the bottom so the smoke can escape?

Been looking for a logical answer to my issue and sifting through wiki's and Google links has worn me down. 

Hopefully the baked wisdom in this corner of the interwebz can help. 

I started smoking when I was in my early teens and really didn't stop until around 23, (I'm 30 now[YIKES]). 

Towards the tail end of my serious smoking I was noticing a difference in my reaction to being high. I was not the social, engaged stoner I once was. I became introverted when high, constant anxiety and random paranoia. It stopped being fun and relaxing. So I stopped.

Since I stopped the daily ritual I've lit up on a few rare occasions over the years only to bring all that anxiety and paranoia rushing back reminding me why I stopped in the first place.

Wanting to get back to that time when I enjoyed being blazed I went out and picked up this guy [Dirty Rico](http://imgur.com/5KtGG).
My thought process is that I may just need to power smoke through this awkward phase and I'll be all good. 

Am I off my rocker with my logic? 
Is this the end my friends?

Any of you Ent's have any advice? Links? Theories? 

Thanks,

Deep_Fry

I was recently at a ten person bonfire where a few of us (including myself) had consumed a beer or two. I blew a .06 and received my very first consumption, sweet. Five of us (all 18) received  consumptions all under .08. We were then sent home with our DD's that we had set up for. After making it a block our three person car was pulled over on the grounds that we had thrown a beer bottle at the street as we were leaving. None of us had done so. Anyway a cop circled the car with a flashlight and noticed the top of a prescription pill bottle poking out a pocket seat cover. It was containing less than a gram of weed that was a friend of ours. Without asking the cop opens the door, finds the weed, and tells us to get out of the car. 

At this point I'd like to add that there was a total of FIVE squad cars. FIVE. What did they find? That original pill bottle, and two half eighths on myself and a friend of mine. When I asked the officer if it was legal to search our car he said that because we were in a car that certain laws gave him the right. Being a bunch of kids we were in no position to argue so we were powerless and had to accept the charges. So my question - is there any point in trying to reverse the possession charges in court or should I accept the charges. I know I broke the law by drinking a beer and possessing marijuana, I'm just wondering if they had grounds to search our vehicle. I know for a fact that no bottle was thrown or broken. The ten kids at this fire are all smart responsible young adults and wouldn't do that. We even drove back to check the street. One cop hinted that he smelled it on us while giving us consumptions and seeing as we were the only car pulled over (and the only car with weed) after leaving the fire, it seems a bit suspicious.

1)Will certain dri deodorant (aluminum chloride) or daily vitamins or lamisil tablets affect my hair in any way?  Ive been taking/using all three for a while now (~3-6 months)

2)If i don't have at least 1.5 inches of hair, will they just piss test me? Because literally all the hair on my body is that short and I did not shave anything since i found out about the test (except my head, but it was already buzzed)

3)If they actually find THC, is it possible for them to still hire me? Ive heard hair tests are mostly for harder drugs, and dont always catch THC.

4)If i test positive, will it affect employment opportunities later in life?

Also, why the fuck would they hair test me for an $8.50/hr line work job at a warehouse if im not using heavy machinery or anything that might be dangerous in the workplace?

Thanks for the help guys

EDIT: Copypasta'd from my /r/trees post:

I went to get the hair test today. This nurse brought me back to an exam room and asked if i had any armpit hair. I showed her the little bit i had and she said it wasnt enough. She asked for leg hair next and same deal. Finally asked for pubic hair, which i told her i shaved a couple days before i knew about the test. She leaves, calls a guy from the company i was applying to, and said that urinalysis wasn't an option, and said I had to reapply when i had enough hair. I spent an hour in traffic going to get a hair test just so they could tell me that they arent testing or hiring me. Complete bullshit

* How can you use it? Based on what I've read, vaping seems the way to go, but I don't have a vaporizer so I'd have to buy one which seems expensive (is it?).

A few weeks ago, my father passed away from cancer at a somewhat early age. It was pretty sudden, and he left behind my sister and I, the rest of his close-knit family, and many friends.

I want to remember him in a way that he would enjoy. He specifically requested (years ago) that no large tree should be planted in his memory. However, he smoked roughly 3-4 ounces of weed a month and was incredibly (though secretly) passionate about it. After discussing it with my family (including my grandparents), we all decided that it would best serve him to name a strain of weed after him. This way, many smaller “trees” would be planted in his memory and in a manner that would best suit him.

As someone who knows nothing about the subject, how do I go about doing such a thing?

- I picked up two varieties from my local collective; one of them looks like and is near the consistency of earwax - though decidedly greener. Handles like a dream. The other is much stickier, closer in consistency  to very thick tree sap. Does anyone have suggestions on separating a usable dab from the rest of the mass? Neither paperclip nor pocket knife have proven effective.

- I picked up an attachment for my water pipe at the local headshop, which was one of the cheaper and easier to use options there. at first blush it resembles a normal water pipe bowl, but it has a globular swelling midway along its length. Inside the bowl itself is some sort of charcoal-colored material that's light and pitted like pumice; it's this material onto which the concentrate is spread, then smoked (vaporized? not sure if anything is actually combusting).

Has anyone used a setup like this before? Any protips? Also, I'm really curious as to what the material in the bowl actually is. It rather resembles the heating stone in this old analog ""vaporizer"" I used to use.

For me it seems that this spiral gets pretty nasty after 6-8 bowls off of this piece. It looks like resin is building up pretty heavily in the glass spiral. I have even had chunks of resin release from the spiral and end up stuck to the glass in the second chamber. 


For cleaning in the past I had been using Forumula 420 which has been a good reliable and easy to use product, but it is pretty costly. So I recently switched to using ISO and table salt, which seems to work mostly as well at a fraction of the cost to me. 


But what I am wondering is if there is any thing that I can to to prevent this from getting dirty so fast in the first place. 


Lastly when the piece gets dirty like this it seems like the hits are much less potent when compared to it being clean. It's almost as if the resin build up is self perpetuating collecting resin faster as it goes. I also figure this resin is all the good stuff I am trying to get in me in the first place. 


So I ask the community does any one have any suggestions for me? (Local headshop owner suggested an ash catcher to resolve the issue, but I am hesitant to spend $50+/- to test this. The guy is smart and a nice guy but he does have an agenda to sell me things.)


Do tree style percs have this same issue? I had a PURP for about two days, but alas it got smashed to bits before it ever got dirty. 


If I can't fix it I am probably going to sell the piece and get my self a nice non-perc bong.

VoidVoice	10	2	4	"Monday morning, I woke about an hour early, my stomach roiling...quick sprint to the loo, empty the stomach, hop in the shower, and get ready for work. It's happened before....probably once a month, or maybe once every two, for a few years now. I've always attributed it to being an idiot and having those two slices of pizza right before bed.

Puke a couple of more times, and call in sick. Figuring it to be flu, or something similar (like excess pizza). Ride it out Tuesday, as I've deadlines that simply can't be missed. Tuesday evening, I'm done. Puked 6 times on my way home. I know what's coming.


About 4 times in the past year and a half, this has happened. I start puking, and cant' stop. Anything, even a mouthful of water, immediately wants back out. If I attempt to down a litre of water on my way to the loo (just to minimize dry heaves), I vomit about every 20 minutes. I can last about 6-8 hours like that, until I near pass out from exhaustion. Lasts around 5-8 days, depending on how quickly I get to the hospital. If I'm on it early, within a day or two of onset, and don't let them try to give me gravol to ride out my ""obvious stomach flu"" and send me home, it's usually about 4-5 days. Only once did I not go to the hospital during these long sessions, and it lasted nearly 10 days (I was travelling, and not able to stay at a hospital).


I've had numerous CT scans, more x-rays than I can count, this time I even had a gastroscopy.I've spoken with several GI specialists, and this time, and neurologist (as apparently repetative vomiting can come due to brain injury as well).

No results. Nothing. If I weren't puking in their faces, they'd tell me I'm the healthiest guy in the room.

Now, I'd not been secretive about my pot use. I was up front with them immediately upon going to Emergency, and have been every time. I'm not stupid. If there is a chance pot was doing it, they needed to know.

I'm a 45 year old male, who has been a daily smoker for 5 or so years,with a bit of a break before that (year?), then back to being a daily smoker for 10 or so before that.  Quantity? I'm a lightweight...though I do (did?) smoke daily, I'd make a quarter last a couple of weeks. Usually a one hitter after the kids went down, and maybe a couple of joints on a Friday night with the boys. No booze, no other drugs of any kind, at all.

This time, they seem convinced that I have CVS. Despite the fact that I am older than any currently researched patients (Oldest one I could find was 36). All research seemed to suggest that it typically struck those *much* younger...as in late teens, early twenties, up into the mid-thirties, but nothing more. (I fully realize that doesn't mean 35+ are immune).

The latest study I could find:  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2982.2011.01791.x/full 

While I'm definitely close to the oldest subject in the study, the mean age (±SD) of CVS was 30 years (±11). So that person was an outlier, and not indicative of the norm *unless I'm totally off my statistics, which well may be, as it's been probably 20 years since I tried to apply it...)

The identied triggers...none of which apply to me;
...they may experience a prodrome, usually intense nausea and pallor sometimes heightened sensitivity to especially light but also smell, sound, pressure, and temperature with sometimes oncoming muscle pain and fatigue is reported by some patients. The majority of sufferers, but not all, can identify ""triggers"" that may precipitate an attack. The most common are various foods, infections (such as colds), menstruation, extreme physical exertion, lack of sleep, and psychological stresses both positive and negative.(none are true in my case...I awoke feeling like I'd better hit the sick bin, or I'll get the wife particularly mad by messing the sheets. I went to bed feeling fine, and in need of no more rest than any other day).

...During an attack a sufferer may be light sensitive (photophobic), sound sensitive (phonophobic), and, less frequently, temperature or pressure sensitive. Some sufferers also have a strong urge to bathe in warm or cold water (apparently, with the cannabiniod users, hot showers reduced symptoms...not me). Some sufferers reports that they experience a restless sensation or stinging pain along the spine, hands, and feet followed by weakness in both legs. (None of which apply to me. Aside from my body wanting to remove whatever it perceived was in my stomach, I felt just fine....well, aside from the ache of dry heaves for days...and any relief I felt at having a hot shower was simply due to removing the sweat of the hours of dry heaving.)

I don't have any of the tiredness, headaches, diarrhea, photo/phonophobia, abdominal pain, nor are any of the ""known"" triggers ones that impact me (within a timeframe relative to the event). I've not had any significant periods without eating (or fasting), no temperature extremes, lack of sleep, overexertion, allergies, ingesting certain foods or alcohol. 

Everything I read suggests CVS is more closely related to migraines than anything else. And I've never had a migraine in my life. I'd be hard pressed to remember a headache that warranted more than a couple of aspirin.

While I'll be the first to admit it's possible that pot plays into CVS just yet, I guess my question is do you think it is significant? Or is this just another 'angle' for the authorities to 'suggest' we don't partake? In my case, it sure feels like a cop-out diagnosis.  If it truly hit chronic users as they're suggesting, wouldn't the ""weed world"" have known about it for a very long time? I mean, I've been smoking for damned near 20 years now (35 if you count my teen/experimental years), and I've never run in to a single person who ever had this sort of thing. You'd think if I'd been hanging with large groups of chronic users, for decades, *some one* would have heard of this....even if it wasn't as ""CVS"", you know?

Don't get me wrong...I'm going to quit, at the very least for a year, to establish if it goes away. If it doesn't though, I'm gonna be pretty pissed at having to give up the one recreational drug I do use. If it's the pot, and CVS in a nearing 50 year old male who has smoked more than half his life is a truly viable thing, well...then life sucks.

Thoughts?


**TL;DR:**  Old man doesn't believe diagnosis based on the fact the research is brand new, and he's never even heard of the issue impacting what he knows to be a *very* large group of users, even though he's been involved with the group for decades."	t5_2rx97	True

I need to pass a drug test, help?	eatmydonuts	13	3	14	"So today at work (I'm a dishwasher at Denny's), I was by my manager's office when she got an email from corporate. Apparently, they're doing drug tests now. I am a frequent smoker, and since I'm on winter break from school, I've been doing it regularly. Luckily, I'm very slender (about 5'11"" and 125 lbs), and I had four days off last week. However, since Monday, I've smoked at least twice a day, not including today. So far, I've started drinking tons of water, I bought some of those cranberry extract pills that are supposed to help, and I'm gonna start exercising daily. But, how screwed am I? Also, what am I missing to help detox?

On a legal note, since taking a DT was not part of my terms of employment, can they even do this? I also heard that they were only doing it to people that they suspect of doing drugs, and I'm not sure whether or not they suspect me. That's profiling, right? If they only select the people who they think use drugs? I just don't think that the way they're going about this is legally permissible.

I'm not sure when the test is, either. Let's assume I have a week or so.

Any help is greatly appreciated. I would really, really hate for this to be the way that my parents find out.

What has the best flavor?	randomgrower	7	2	3	"I'm growing three different strains, and I'm looking to get something new off a seed bank.  I was hoping to exchange thoughts from others that have tried multiple strains.  Here's what I have:

LA OG - this is a low-yielding super-dank strain.  It tastes like Venom OG and a lot of the top-shelf strains I've had in CA.  It's an indica, but it grows super tall and is vine-y; 6-9 feet tall and flopping over.  I like to selectively remove leaves from plants, but this plant needs them in order to help keep it standing up, even with posts.

Skunk - This was a hand-me-down strain that doesn't really match up with other Skunk flavors I've had, but it's a robust bushy girl that has a good yield and gives you couch lock and possible day-naps.  It's the most tolerant as far as mistakes (burn over/under watering)

Trainwreck - Another hand-me down, this is my mildest strain that I use for day time medication.  I'm really not fond of this one, but it does taste decent.

I'm thinking about the following strains:

- Jack Herer - This is the only sativa that I think I've gotten a cerebral high from - but only once out of like 8 times.  I think I can unlock its potential.  Great taste.
- Northern Lights - I miss this strain, and haven't had it in a while.  Also tastes great.
- Ron Burgundy - probably the best tasting or most unique tasting weed I've ever had.  Killer color.  Impossible to find in seed form

My sneak was good. It didn't get hot and I could drop it into my pocket at any time. It was all metal and thus would clean up thoroughly. It looked like a cigarette light from a car. I have seen a junior looking similar. Mine was nicer. I also thought it pretty funny, as a bonus. I am not necessarily looking to duplicate it.

The ones I have seen, long ago, had a screw in circle with a tiny hole you could draw the flame through. One thing that is Very Attractive to me right now is that it minimizes the odor, while you smoke and afterwards,  both. Otherwise my bedroom will eventually reek. Other gets into walls, clothing and papers.

I know an MFLB is good but it's complex, tricky and expensive, with the cost of the whole rig (gotta have the home plug-in or the battery toll is immense) approaches $200. And it's big compared to a simple pipe. So I'm heading off those suggestions ""at the pass"". (cowboy image)

So I recently got a job at a large insurance company. I was interning with them previously for the past couple of years during the summers. When I first got the job I did have to take a drug test (back before I smoked). I'm in college and graduating in May. When I was first offered the job the HR woman said I would need to take a drug test, I kinda freaked out, but then I called to schedule it and they said since I was employed with the company in the past 12 months I don't need one. 

Currently they are running a background check, I have a spotless record, nothing they're gonna see on there. My question/concern is, do you think they may have me do a drug test anyways? Also, do you think I'd loose the job over some pot? (I know it depends a lot on the company). As I'm writing this I realize how crazy I sound, I guess I'm just paranoid. I haven't smoked in the past month but I'd really like to get back into the grove of vaping with my MFLB most nights. My job starts in mid July.

I've been having a bit of a problem with a one hitter I bought online recently. It's a straight through pipe, with a hole on constant diameter through the center. I've only ever owned a one hitter with a distinct ""bowl"" part, and I never got ash in my mouth with it. With this one it seems unavoidable.

I've found that using it with cupped hands (like a chillum) helps a bit, but the only real solution I've found is folding up a piece of wire (Don't worry, it's a material that won't react to the heat) and pushing it a little way down the shaft. that makes a kind of filter thing. But it gets clogged really quickly.

I've been interested in getting a bubbler for some time now and the guy offered to cut me a good deal because they were just opening. This piece was listed at $35 and he gave it to me for $25. As far as the price goes I can't complain but I do have a couple questions about some of the things he told me.

He said that because it was water filtered it would be about 50% more efficient than using a straight pipe (which I don't really understand how it changes the efficiency).

He also told me that it was fumed with 24 carat gold. What does this mean? and is this realistically true? There is a gold shine to the glass but it doesn't seem reasonable to me that they would do that.

Another quick question while I'm at it, is there anything specific I should know about a bubbler vs. the straight pipe(non-water pipe) that I'm used to?

I feel like they would have some amazing stories. Unfortunately though, I don't know any adults that smoke openly. How would I? How can I find them? Society has drilled into my brain that its illegal and any adult who sees you is calling the cops on you. Now that I think about it though, most of them probably just laugh at us.

Pot has a really potent effect on me. At first, time would get extremely slow. This went on for my first month of smoking pot. Then I stopped getting that time slow effect, and instead it started getting more psychedelic.  I started seeing strange things (like a small dose of magic mushrooms. No visual hallucinations, but the world did look very different), having auditory hallucinations, and sound/color synesthesia. Of course, this might seem like a good thing. Well, that is if it didn't also make me super paranoid. At some point I was at a party, and smoked way more than I should have knowing my very low tolerance level (it's worth mentioning that I hadn't drunk any alcohol that day) and had this strange hallucination type of thing (like a fake memory interpreted as a vision of the future, if that makes any sense) and became convinced that something awful would soon happen which would leave me somehow paralyzed for the rest of my life. So I started panicking, and my friend came with me to walk me home. Well, I wouldn't even get out of the house. I was afraid there was a person with a gun wanting to kill me in every single car that drove by on the road. Also, when I smoke pot, I don't want to be around people. Usually I start being highly suspicious of them and thinking that everything I say or do is stupid and they must hate me for it. For this reason, I stopped smoking a few months ago. Problem is, I kind of miss it now. I really liked smoking pot when I was alone listening to music, because I would see all sorts of nice colors and hear the music like I'd never heard it before. However, now I'm not sure whether I want to start smoking again. I'm not sure whether it'd be healthy for me to do so. The thing is, my mother was psychotic, and I haven't always been completely sane myself, so I'm afraid pot could increase my chances of developing a severe mental illness. However, I feel drawn to it. I miss that feeling, and I'd like to start smoking again, at least occasionally. 
So, to summarize, here are my questions:

Would it be reasonable for me to go back to smoking pot, knowing that I have a family history of mental illness and it has such a strong effect on me (psychedelic trip, paranoia...)?

What strand do you advise I smoke?

Any other time (which isn't that often) there is someone else with me to roll/pack it for me. The one time I tried preparing trees for smoking by myself (tin foil pipe) I was like [this](http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/234/739/fa5.jpg). I must have screwed up quite bad because I didn't react too well. (It wasn't a total loss, because I carefully followed a cannibutter recipe using the trees I didn't smoke, spread it on toast and felt fucking awesome.)

Anyway I can't readily obtain trees, so when I do I'd like to be able to be more confident with preparing joints, especially for parties."	t5_2rx97	True

SchadeyDrummer	10	1	7	"Here it is... it's a concept I've thought of a lot, and still I ponder on this and ideas that stem from it today. I'd like to share this... please, anyone let me know if you think the same way. 

Here is my rant.... AMA if anything is unclear. (this was a chat to my friend)


&gt;you realize that there are billions of people on this planet
&gt;that a billion is a thousand millions
&gt;think about a million....
&gt;you will NEVER meet a million people in your whole life, even if every single day you met a hundred people. You will **never** meet MOST of the people in your STATE (let alone the world)
&gt;there are millions of bands, (billions of songs)
&gt;you will **never** hear **MOST** of the bands (let alone songs) that have ever existed, even if you listen to a new band every second for the rest of your life.  
&gt;There are millions of ACTORS/PLUMBER/BUTTFUCKERS/COUNTY CLERKS/YOUTUBE CELEBRITIES...
&gt;fill in the blank.. there are more (whatevers) than you could ever, ever know
&gt;YET
&gt;there is Albert Einstein


&gt;there is Winston Churchill


&gt;there is Martin Luther King


&gt;there is John Lennon


&gt;there is Jabba the Hut                                  :P



&gt;WHY do these stand out among the millions? among the literally MIND-numbing numbers of people? too many for any one person to count.
&gt;how do you stand out amongs LEIGIONS of people who are exactly like you (and often better)? 
&gt;maybe your whole life is meant to exist on a much smaller plane... a small community


EDIT: I crunched some of those numbers.... so *technically* if you lived to be 70 years old, and you met literally 100 people every day... you'd meet 2,555,000 people... but, realistically... I'm sure you, I and everyone will only meed WELL, well under 1 million people.

My understanding of vaporizers is that they heat up the weed to the point where the THC vaporizes, and that is what is being inhaled.  Since I have only been smoking already vaped bud for awhile now, which shouldn't have any/much THC on it, will a drug test still pick up on it?  Do drug tests screen for cannabinoids as well as THC?

Well, I've known that marijuana is a miracle drug when it comes to fixing ailments, but only recently have I been researching more and more about how it exactly helps. Literally all of her problems could be solved with cannabis; however, she's from Kansas and has, therefore, only heard the anti-cannabis rhetoric, so she, therefore, frowns on my smoking and worries about smoking herself. All she sees is addiction and jail time and becoming a hindrance to society; though, I have proven time and time again to her one can function just fine on it. It's not because she's stupid, but rather because she has been force fed conservative propaganda since she was little. I recently brought up that marijuana's qualities can help her on every front she has issues (I've been trying to get her to smoke anyway) and I was giving her all the evidence and the studies. She was interested because she wants to get out from under this shadow she's been living under for the the last 5 years, but she's still very hesitant and scared. I guess I have a hard time understanding because I have always harbored an interest in marijuana since I was little. I just want her to see I'm just being a friENT trying to help one of his best friends out.

I think a few weeks ago when I smoked I was browsing reddit (it could have been something else, really, I can't remember). I found two pictures that I thought I saved somewhere, but apparently I did not. Here are the descriptions.

Picture 1: An image with the different types of THC and its effects on the body. There is a nice table listing the types of THC on the top and the effects of it on the left. There were checkmarks indicating if a type of THC had a specific effect on the human body.

Picture 2: An image with the length of a high, achieved by different methods (oral, smoke, vape?).

1328918178.0	pk3kq	Have trees ever made you anxious? Longtime ENT on the verge of giving up.	anxiousontrees	6	1	14	"Throwaway account just to be safe.

The short (**TL;DR**) version: I've had a loving relationship with trees for about 5-6 years now. For the longest time I loved it SO MUCH. It made me creative and giggly and happy. A few months ago, trees started giving me moderate to severe anxiety and sometimes even full blown attacks. This'll be while I'm at a [1] or [2], barely even feeling anything. Being any higher on the scale than that makes it exponentially worse. Naturally, this has made me want to do it less and less, and now I'm at the point where I'm wondering if I'll ever love it again.

I'm not sure exactly what I'm asking you for, r/asktrees. I guess I wanna know, has anyone had any similar experiences? Can anyone link me to some research on the subject? Anyone successfully overcome this?

More details for those who want more:

- This is not paranoia. I used to get paranoid back in the early days of toking, but paranoia was always associated with specific thoughts I was having, like ""What if I get caught?"" This, by contrast, feels like a purely physical reaction. I've thought long and hard about how to best explain it to others, and this is the best I came up with: Have you ever had a friend jump out and scare you? The second you see your friend, you realize it's a practical joke and that you're perfectly safe, but you don't recover immediately--- your heart's still pounding, etc etc. Even if you only stay in this state for a few secs, you are at this moment physically panicking but mentally calm. 

- For anyone who wants to comment ""it's all your state of mind,"" see the above. I've had this happen while watching my favorite movie and feeling perfectly happy, laughing my ass off--- suddenly boom, anxious as fuck. Maybe it's subconscious, but it certainly seems disconnected from my conscious train of thought. 

- My bff seems to have the same thing happening to her. It started happening to us completely independently (we live in different states since a year ago, have totally different connections). We were talking on the phone one time and I brought it up and she goes ""me too!"" We had never talked about it before, so it's not like we subconsciously influenced each other to have this reaction or something. We started smoking around the same time 5-6 years ago. 

- Location has no effect. Strain has some effect, but not much. For whatever reason, smoking through a vap actually has the most effect-- it alleviates the problem greatly, generally speaking.

Here's the worst part, and the thing I'm most afraid of. If I have to give up trees over this, then ok, I'll be quite sad but whatever. The thing is, I've recently (and I believe unrelatedly) developed full blown anxiety/panic disorder. I'm pretty sure it started because of a physical illness I had, but there's a nagging part in the back of my mind that says, what if I did this to myself with trees? There's evidence against that because the whole tree-anxiety thing happened way before this disorder, and never carried over into my tree-free time. The other part of the evidence is I've had that physical illness before, and it's always caused anxiety/panic problems that go away as soon as the physical illness is cured. The only difference this time is that the physical illness was cured but the anxiety/panic has stuck around. I'm pretty sure said physical illness is and was the real cause, but I can't shake the doubt that trees had something to do with it.

Sorry this was so long-winded, r/asktrees. I wanted you to have all the deets you'd need. Please, please, if you can, help me get to the bottom of this thing.

I'm an 18 year old female Ent that lives with my grandmother, who adopted me shortly after birth. I've only been smoking for about a year or so, and she knows I smoke, although she doesn't realize how often I do so. We have a long line of different cancers and glaucoma on our side of the family, and I know trees can help prevent and treat such ailments. 

My grandmother happens to be an (almost) extreme right-wing republican, who also happened to grow up during the days of Reefer Madness, so she has this sort of preconceived idea that ""Marijuana is bad, mmkay?"" 

She's also getting OLD, Reddit. She's starting to suffer from some pretty severe eye problems, she's complaining about her joints constantly hurting, and she has something wrong with her back, the name of which has currently escaped me. Possibly multiple sclerosis or something along those lines? 
She has absolutely no health insurance, so she refuses to go to the doctor to get anything prescribed for her pain, and even if she did, she more than likely wouldn't be able to afford it. 

So I figured since I'm buying the occasional gram anyway, I might as well share with her if it'll help. I just need to convince her to try it! So please Reddit, help me find some way to convince my grandmother to smoke with me! "	t5_2rx97	True

What ratio of herb to alcohol is best? I have about 6 grams of stems, should that affect my ratio?

What is the best temperature and duration to decarb? I have heard that cold decarbing is possible, can someone please explain this?

I have heard that steeping in the freezer is a good method because the trichomes freeze, become brittle and break off of the plant matter. Other sources say to keep it room temperature, some say warm. What method is better? How long should I steep for?

Is there a way to minimise chlorophyll taste? I am using Spirytus Polish alcohol because Everclear is not available where I live. I have read glycerine is better for taste but not as potent/concentrated.

* Is there a recommended way to light the bowl? Tilting the pipe and lighting, etc

* Any tips on packing?
* How to not heat up the metal where you toke from
* Disposing of ash and cleaning

I had this Altoids can and it had stems and a pill in there and my dad found it. Needless to say, my dad flipped out. My boyfriend told me to blame it on him. I did but my dad still doesn't trust me completely so he's making me take an at home drug test.

Last week, I smoked heavily. I probably smoked everyday that week. It was usually about 4-5 bowls and 2-3 joints everyday. I smoked a little on 420 before my dad got me. And I smoked the leftover 420 weed Sunday. If it's necessary to know, I'm about 5'3"" and weigh about 105 pounds.

I've been looking up ways to get rid of the THC in my system. I saw that you can get Sure Jell or Jell-o and mix that up with water a few hours before the test. I already know about drinking a lot of water but it probably won't work that well. Any other way that will definitely get the THC out of my system?

My boyfriend and I are inexperienced weed smokers. I've only smoked twice before the incidence I will mention, and he had only smoked a handful of times before as well. Last weekend (Apr 5-7) I brought a gram of weed with me to his house and we smoked up. We had half of the gram altogether that weekend (so each of us probably smoked .25g of weed each). If it matters, it was done with a bong each time. We smoked once Friday night, once both Saturday morning and once that night, and a little bit Sunday morning. After we parted Sunday night, we each took half of the half gram that was left home with us.

From that point on my boyfriend has been experiencing a body high. Monday night it was still going on, and he smoked the rest of the weed, and the 'body high' was still there. His mind is completely sober, but his sense of touch is on the fritz. Everything feels weird to touch, and, in his words, feels 'long and drawn out' and 'slow'. Even the sun on his body feels weird. 

So my question: has anybody out there experienced this before? Normal? Something to worry about? When will it wear off?

More info: I smoked the same weed and, while I got plenty high, never had this symptom at all, high or sober. Neither of us are on any medications that would interact with the weed. Our dealer is plenty trustworthy, and I was there during the transaction, so I'm reasonably certain that it was not laced with anything. Also, no clue what strain of weed it is.

TL;DR: Boyfriend smoked weed, things feel very weird to touch as if he is still high (though sober mentally), lasting several days, what the fuck is going on?"	t5_2rx97	True

I tried asking these questions on a popular weed forum, but got 0 responses. I know Reddit in general/ ents in particular tend to be more helpful, so hopefully I get some answers. I just bought a brand new solid valve volcano and I'm loving it so far, but I do have a couple questions. 

First off, does the filling chamber have any way of attaching to the unit? I know the filling chamber for the easy valve has some clips to attach it securely, but as far as I can tell, you just have to set the solid valve's chamber on top and hope it doesn't fall. It's kinda heavy so it does stay for the most part, but I found that when in a room with a fan, I have to hold it in place or it will blow off. This doesn't seem quite right... am I doing something wrong?

Secondly, some vapor leaks from the slits in the plastic part attached to the bag ([Here's](http://imgur.com/388iV) a picture with arrows to be more clear what I'm talking about). It only does this when the bag is filling up, not when you are sucking the vapor out. Not a lot is escaping, but you'd think that when you pay almost 700 bucks for a vaporizer, it wouldn't leak.

So, if anyone could help me out with these questions, that would be splendid. Also let me know if you need any more info from me regarding my setup to answer the questions.

Thanks a lot!

-----------------------
EDIT: I emailed Storz-Bickel about this and this is what they had to say:

Attachment to the exhaust vent:

You are absolutely right, the solid valve only “sits” on the exhaust vent of the base unit. It is the weight that keeps the solid valve in place. The solid valve was the very first design of a valve system, our experience over the years has led to the development of the easy valve. Advantages of the easy valve are the clips, the filling chamber diameter and the reduced use of metal surface inside the valve system (&gt; less condensation). With the solid valve, balloon sizes can be custom made.
 
Vapor leakage: 

Usually you only have a little loss of vapor when the balloon is filled. Due to the overpressure in the balloon the vapor seeks the easiest way out; so vapor leaks though the slits of the valve."	t5_2rx97	True

* Say i turn the vape on, load the wand, insert the wand and then go make dinner. The bud is being heated up, but the is not moving. Will this waste THC, or will it stay there until i hit it? (My guess: It's fine to leave it there, but if it's too hot then you'll burn the bud.)

* Same setup as before, but now there's a fan blowing and my thumb isnt over the hose. Will fluid dynamics pull the vapor through the hose? (My guess: Keep the hose covered or away from the fan, Bernoulli principle at work.)  

* I have a 7-foot hose. Someone said this is really bad because by the time the vapor gets through the hose it's wasted. Are there downsides to such a long hose? It's medical grade. (My guess: No downsides. The time spent in the hose is minimal.)

I've been toking for a while now and I've always experienced the same burnt out feeling a couple hours after smoking. After I come down from my high I feel extremely tired.

Is there any tips to avoid this? I initially thought that the quality of the bud had something to do with its burnout. The higher the quality, the less burnt out you feel. Can someone confirm this?

The conversation carried on with her seeming to think that it was for herbs like parsley and oregano, until she mentioned my sister said something along the lines of ""Isn't that for weed?"" now because my sister knows that I toke, I was pretty pissed off at her for landing me in it there, but my mum still seemed like she thought it was all innocent.

Conversation ended and we went back to our shopping, after getting hope i opened the package to have a look at my new grinder (she had brought it with her to give to me) i then see a nice leaf on the top of the grinder, there was no way my mum is this ignorant, she's a smart person, nothing gets past her. But again she never said she thought it was for trees.

So I'm not sure if she's trolling me or genuinely has no clue about it. I was sure if she found out she'd go nuts and be angry at me, my Dad would be worse, I hate to imagine. It just worries me that my Mum is a well educated person, and doesn't seem to be in the know about this, she's the sort who knows what all of her Xmas/birthday presents are a week in advance without even seeing them.

She is a bit of a troll though, which is why its made me unsure, she has a bit of a sadistic sense of humour, not to the extreme but she likes to mess with people in non-hurtful ways, stuff like this exact situation, she'd get a good giggle at me freaking out being paranoid over the situation.

I'm at a loose end as to what to do now, if she is just trolling me, she's probably expecting me to come clean and be honest, but on the other side if she really is totally oblivious I don't want to land myself in it.

Let me set the scene: I've been a pretty regular user for over a year, so smoking about three times a week, sometimes less. March 1st I started a tolerance break.

I am pretty healthy, I drink a gallon of water each day, eat minimally processed foods, exercise normally, and am pretty mentally sound.

My question is, could this be attributed to not having smoked in a couple weeks? Does/ has anyone else had this problem?

As a toker and fellow ent, I share the same love for marijuana as all of you. About three months ago I had a bad acid trip that ended up in my friend going to the hospital and the other going to jail.

I ended up fine, just some PTSD, but last week after smoking a bowl I was exposed to crack cocaine smoke (I didn't partake but was in the room with friends) and it caused me to have a terrible panic attack.

Every time I have smoked since, I get crippling anxiety attacks. I didn't smoke for three days, then took a couple of hits and the anxiety came on like a tidal wave.

Smoking marijuana helps me with sleep, creativity, and even my soft bipolar disorder. I don't want to lose the benefits it gives me just because of anxiety!

So I have a couple questions.. first is there any chance of them having me retake the test? This would honestly be my ideal scenario because I know I can pass then and I'm still abstaining so then it won't be for nothing. Second how nervous should I really be?

I'm guessing I'll get a lot of suggestions for the Magic-Flight Launch Box. I've spent good money on a pipe before, but wondering if the MFLB, or other quality portable vapes, are worth the investment. 

I want something that is as easy as packing a bowl and grabbing a BIC, but need something that will hold up to everyday, multiple sessions.

I've smoked from a plug-in vape ""box"" before. I liked it, but never bought one. I remember the smell not being as noticeable as smoke, but can I smoke from MFLB and go to my mom's house and not have her question ""what's that smell?"" (she doesn't)

1350664185.0	11r5br	So, I wanna make some Cannabutter. Is it worth it?	LemonMae	5	2	9	"I've never tried making it before, &amp; I've never had the experience of eating an edible before. But, I'm tight on cash &amp; my lungs are starting to hate me for smoking, so I thought that using my weed for cannabutter to make some brownies might be a good idea. I've been told that the effects of edibles generally last much longer than when smoking, so I thought that it might also help me in the area of conserving as much bud as I could. 

So, here's my plan. I should have enough cash this weekend to afford a 1/4, &amp; I found a recipe for cannabutter that calls for a 1/4 &amp; one stick of butter. The idea is to use a double boiler (or just a small pot inside of a bigger pot, if you don't have one), boil water in the larger pot &amp; then place the butter into the smaller pot &amp; put the small pot into the water in the big pot so that the butter can melt. Then you get your finely ground weed &amp; start slowly mixing it into the melted butter. Then there's a conflict between how long you're supposed to let it simmer, I've seen anywhere from 45min to 12hours... Obviously I'm not going to leave it there for 12hours, so I was thinking maybe a 1.5hr or 2hr would be okay? Also, when it comes to straining it when it's finished, I haven't got any cheese cloth to use so I was planning on placing a coffee filter on the bottom of a pasta strainer. Would that work alright? &amp; then when it was all finished, I would just use all of it to make a batch of brownies that could hopefully last me a couple weeks (or more).

I know it seems &amp; sounds easy enough, but I'm just worried because if I do this, that 1/4 will be the only bud I'll be able to get for at least 2 weeks, if not longer. I really would like to try it, because I think that edibles would be a healthier way for me to enjoy my bud, while also being able to use as little of it as possible. I figure one brownie could last me a couple days, if I use the entire thing of cannabutter to make them... Don't you think? I'm just so worried that it won't work, &amp; it'll be some sort of disastrous experiment that will leave me terribly, horrifyingly sober for who knows how long. xDD

I guess what I'm asking is, would it be worth the risk? &amp;, do you think it would actually work? &amp; also, should I use the whole thing of cannabutter for one box of brownies, or only a little bit?"	t5_2rx97	True

* How do bongs maintain airtight where the downstem and bong connect?

1333049613.0	rjp7i	I need to ship a fairly well-used glass piece, any tips/advice/warnings on how to safely clean/ship it?		4	0	3	Hi, my friend flew down from out of state to visit me at my university last week for spring break. He bought himself a very nice, 60$ bowl from a local shop. We smoked out of it a good 2-5 times a day for that entire week then my friend promptly realized he didn't want to carry a used piece on the plane with him. He decided it would be safer to leave me with money to ship it back to him. This obviously leaves me with a few problems. For one, is shipping something like this even safe? I know I can clean it, the most efficient way I've heard of so far is to use Isopropyl alcohol and salt. Also, what shipping service should I use? UPS, USPS, Fedex, or does it even matter?

1330899192.0	qhnpp	T breaks for the swiftly tolerant. 	canna-crux	10	8	9	"So I have only been smoking cannabis for approx a year. I started smoking to help with several medical conditions. The problem is, one of these conditions causes me to build tolerances ultra fast. As with most medication, it stops being as effective over time, causing me to need to consume more. For this very reason I switched from opiates to cannabinoids. 

Good thing is, increasing the amount of cannabis won't kill me like doing the same with opiates can do eventually. Now I have never taken a tolerance break. Since I started smoking there hasn't been one day that has gone by that I didn't smoke...just like how it was before with the opiates. However...I used to be able to use just a pinch and be fine for a couple of hours...now I'm smoking in grams.

I'm officially driver-licensed and living in San Francisco now and since I've found it hard getting a hookup at this point I want to go ahead and try getting a MMJ card. I've done some searching on here and most people say they just walk into a place and walk out with a card.
I am hoping for some more detail than that. Feel free to PM me if you'd like.

I suffer from some pretty shitty anxiety so my biggest fear is trying to do this and getting super rejected and having to walk away empty handed or being perceived as a wrong-doer or something.

* 
Do I need to acquire medical records before going in? Like if I don't have them am I going to be forced to walk out and come back later?

* 
Will I have to wait or go through another process in order to walk into a dispensary and use the card?

* 
Do I need proof of residence other than a driver's license? Like utility bills or something?

* 
Do I need cash, check, credit card, etc?

So I am forced to smoke outside most of the time, unlike today... Today i stayed home sick because I slept horribly and my throat was on fire. SO. My brilliant idea to cure of a burning throat was to smoke some trees. When I neared the end of the bowl I started to notice that there was less and less smoke than usual, as I kept smoking I realized that for the past maybe 8 months i have been holding the lighter to barely nothing in the bowl thinking i was getting smoke but i was only getting hot air and it exhaling as steam tricking my high self into believing it was smoke. so yeah my chest has really sore for no reason and my throat hasn't felt right since 12-20-11 and i was wondering if it has anything to do with inhaleing butane i also have an extra vertebra in my lumbar and i also mono during christmas. i dont really know why i made this post i am just a bit curious i thought it was funny at first but now i'm starting to notice that things could be connected.  it was going to be a funny serious post but thats when i was at a [4],thats why the beginning was more grammarery than now, i am now just typing my thoughts down for no reason at a [7] or [8].  its pretty interesting smoking in your room man this seriously the first time i smoked in my room, and i mean really smoke, and ive been smoking for at least 3 years i know thats not much but most people have had more chances to do so than me so after three years i smoke comfortable and no worry it was amazing and i am glad i could share this with you.

Well, that's about the problem. I have been smoking trees for years, sometimes more, sometimes less. For the last two months I experience a weird side effect. It feels like I have to take a piss all the time. To be precise, it's more like a burning feeling in the first few cm of my dick; I guess you guys will know what I mean.
The funny thing is that when I smoked the day before I go to the toilet like every half hour or so. Oddly enough, I can't really reproduce it consistently, as it is a bit different concerning intensity and how long it lasts each time.
Btw, I pretty much ruled out things like std or the like. I'm seriously thinking about quitting trees, you are my last resort.

Then, when they emailed me around the start of June with the offer, I accepted and they said ""we'll be in contact sooner around your start date"" or something along those lines. I'm guessing I shouldn't just ask, ""am I going to have to take a drug test?"" How should I go about finding out?

1371424894.0	1ghbqp	Looking for diffuser bowl or similar to make a bottle into a bong.	ProfessionalGeek	3	0	7	"I'm in the process in trying to make my own bong, and I wanted to have a removable downstem/diffuser, but I'm having trouble finding one.

I know generally how to make the bong, but I can't seem to find the diffuser I'm imagining. [This](http://www.gorillaglass.com/images/diffuser.jpg) is the sort of thing I think would be easiest to use, if the top part was actually a bowl. If I choose this method, I only want to have the one piece, so I don't have to permanently attach the downstem to the bottle, making it hard to clean. However, I can't seem to find a glass downstem diffuser bowl.

My other idea, although more complex and with more parts, uses something like [this](http://www.grasscity.com/us_en/black-leaf-bong-adapter-18-8mm-14-5mm.html#.Ub5HafnSw1A), which I could just glue to the bottle and then use any other downtem and bowl combo. However, I'm not able to find something that would have the right dimensions to fit the downstem well enough, as I'm worried the diameter of the hole won't be wide enough for the diffuser downstem to fit.

If anyone would can provide some advice on where I can get these parts or other designs, please do! Thanks!"	t5_2rx97	True

It's been a little longer than a week since I smoked (May 3rd), but before then I smoked everyday for about 7 weeks. I did smoke in small amounts; usually not even a half-bowl (I get high easily and prefer being under a [5]). Over the course of those 7 weeks I smoked half of an 8th.


Last week, I took niacin and drank a lot of water and cranberry juice. This weekend I was in my car a lot and had several normal days (no extra water or niacin) and then I took the at-home one. I'm sure it's not because of dilution (?).


Is it possible that I'm already clean? If it might be dilution that caused me to pass (the at-home), will it work when I go to the lab next week for the job screening? Or am I just worrying too much about this? "	t5_2rx97	True
1367339956.0	1df493	This sub has tons of great info! Still have some drug test questions though..	Clementine3	3	0	7	"I recently began a new job hunt and therefore had to stop smoking because I know I will get tested for the kinds of jobs I am applying for. I see a lot about how weight, metabolism, etc play a huge factor but time is the ultimate decider. I stopped this week and know I have a while to wait but I just want to be fully prepared. I am really worried that I wil not have enough time to clear my system before a drug test comes up. 
Some background about me: I'm 5'8 female 120 lbs. who has been smoking multiple times a day everyday for the past year (.5-1 gram/day usually). I have a fast metabolism and rarely workout (not sure if this works to my advantage in detoxing or not). If you need anymore info, just let me know. 

I guess my main questions are:

1) What can I personally do to speed up the process? (I already plan to not smoke, drink lots of water, work out daily and take more vitamins)

2) If I stick to a strict daily regimen of water, exercise, etc., how long do you predict until I could potentially pass a drug test? (I plan to test along the way with at-home kits) 

3) If I have little/no fat on me, could that potentially make it harder to burn out the THC? Could this also change the effectiveness of a detox drink? (I tried detox drinks, Qcarbo, a couple years ago and they NEVER worked but I also could have been using them wrong)

4) EXTRA CREDIT- Bud really helps me sleep and since I've stopped, getting to bed is not very easy. If any of you lovely ents have suggestions that may help me sleep during this break, I'd love to hear 'em!

Ilwrath	3	0	6	"So I've been on this kick of making edibles for a week or so and me and my friends decided to try this Coconut oil thing we had heard about. The problem is that, other than one of us that barely ever smokes, we didn't really get high. We got a little buzzed about an hour and a half in but by the time we were at two it was pretty much already gone (out one friend said he was high for a few hours though.)

It has always really bothered me that everywhere I go on the internet gives me different temperatures and time for cooking, thus I'm never sure Im doing it right. My gut tells me one of those two things (time/temp) are where we fucked up. Here is the process we used.

* GRIND-Shredded 4.1 grams trees in grinder, places on aluminum foil and added a sprinkle on an unmeasured amount of keif guesstimated at .4 grams.

* DECARB-Place foil on pan and into oven at 300 degrees F for 18 minutes (This is where I feel I may have made a boo boo. Last time we did this I used 222F for 10 mins and it worked fine, I had read though that higher temps under 350F do the job better and longer is better so I tried this.)
 
* OIL PREP- Heated 5 tablespoons of pure coconut oil in a frying pan and held it at aprox. 250F (Due to the use of a frying pan, the low amount of liquid, and a candy thermometer keeping temps, this may have been higher or lower at some times.)
 
* COOK-Mixed decarbed weed with oil and kept on heat stirring frequently for about 40 mins. 
 
* FREEZE-Drained oil through cheesecloth and placed liquid in freezer for 1 hour. Removed and took [picture](http://i.imgur.com/nr50m.jpg). Then divided into 4 parts and ate in various ways.

TL;DR-Coconut oil with weed did not work, see above and tell me why!"	t5_2rx97	True
1329534717.0	pusoe	Trees, please tell me what I should do?	eatinglights	6	3	15	"My parents caught me smoking a while ago, and said they were very concerned. They didn't get mad, they just made me give them my piece. The second time, the found my weed and threw it away, and had a firm talking to me that they didn't care if I smoked in my own house, but not in theirs. They found it disrespectful and illegal, and taboo. But they mentioned that all their current friends do it from time to time. They even encouraged me to only do it at friends houses.

Elated, I bought some from a friend and we vaped the night before. I was more concerned about the odor, so I tried harder to hide the bud. But I guess it was too smelly, because when I left home to go vape and hang out with a friend, I came home to my father saying that my door was removed and I could have it back ""maybe"".

But the thing is--this gaping hole on the side of my already tiny bedroom frightens me. I'm trying to pretend that it doesn't bother me, as to not make my parents think that this is a genuine punishment, but a soon-to-be faded memory.

I'm high right now and shaky, and a little sad that I'm ruining my relationship with my parents. Especially my mom, who has been a lot more agitated and short with me due to stress at work and going through menopause.

I'm willing to give it up, but I enjoy marijuana. Ever since I started smoking/vaping, I've become a better person. My temper has shortened, my confidence has increased, and I'm able to let things go, which is pheunomnal since I struggled with anxiety and coping skills for the past four years.

This little smelly plant has given me so much, but I'm afraid what it might take away.

Granted, I will be going off to college in late August (yes, I'm only 17) and that may seem like a good six months away, but it's still fairly soon if you look in the terms of one's overall life.

So, anyways... Trees, I've been with you all so long, uptoking and listening and laughing with you guys... Please, tell me what I should do?"	t5_2rx97	True

3) How many times do you think of a thought before you see it visualised in your head?

i. If so, how true is it? Do we/can we relate on deeper levels that we aren't consciously aware of?  

5) How many times do you try and act smart - but then halfway through your thoughts you sound like a dumbass?

I'm sure this is a fairly common occurrence, but I want to know what's the longest you've ever been high from one smoking session?	t5_2rx97	True

I've heard that eating more food kills the high, due to the added food in your stomach, true?
Also considering I don't have any weed to smoke I'm looking for the most bang for my buck, should I not eat edibles right after a meal? Basically I would like to know pro edible tips, mainly regarding the optimal time to eat them. Thanks"	t5_2rx97	True

1359786047.0	17qr2h	This may be a naive question.	Oak7ree	2	0	1	Every single time I'm high I feel like I have to piss and that if I don't piss I'm just going to soil myself. I will then go to the bathroom and piss, but then I will stand there for what feels like 10+ minutes wiggling it, thinking that I can piss more when I really can't. And even after I have pissed, the feeling will return relatively soon. I hate being high in public solely for this reason, and even when I'm just with a few friends it's always at least in the back of my mind. Does anyone else have this problem? And if so, any remedies for it? Thank you in advance!	t5_2rx97	True

This is the escreen service code that has me freaking out about my future.  I quit smoking pot for a month after being regular user (a little every night before bed) in order to find a new job.  I've looked into everything and I am willing to do whatever it takes to get this job.  I am an EXTREMELY hairy dude and I shaved off most of my body hair last night.  Based on what I have read, the bottom 1/2 inch or less of hair on my head should be clean since I haven't smoked for 30 days.  Is this the hair cut I need to get in order to make sure I am covered in only clean hair?  How much of my body hair should I shave off?  All of it?  Will a nurse go looking for hair in my ass crack?  Like I said, I am willing to do ANYTHING it take to pass this test.  HELP!!!

1344244425.0	xrb7b	Vegas Titanium (legal) - Have any of you tried it? - First trip	Todderfly	8	4	6	"Hey Guys!

The other day I tried Vegas Titanium. Now, I'm not a huge pot smoker, and can't actually smoke weed as I have urine tests at work. So my friend brought over this free sample called Vegas Titanium. 

My friend who always smokes weed went first, and my friend and myself found it weird that he put down the bong after 2 hits, and was just laughing with red eyes. 
I was a little nervous, but thought what the hell, this looks like it might be fun (I had never actually been ""high"" before yesterday). 

I had a hit and coughed my lungs up, and within literally 10 seconds, I was feeling very light. I had to sit down, then just lost my perspective on everything. To the point I thought I was going to die. I had to beg my friend to take me to bed, and thought I was floating and seeing shit. It lasted 15 minutes, but it was the scariest 15 minutes of my life. 

My friend texted me about 2 hours ago, saying that he tried it again, and nearly got his friends GF the call the ambulance, as he thought he was going to die too haha!

Needles to say, it was a terrible experience for me, and am just curious if anyone else have tried it? 

Also, what are the chances of having a ""good"" trip if I were to try it again? 

I'm not sure if these are in the rules - but what synthetic (if you guys take smoke it) weed have you guys had good experiences with? 

Thanks ^_^"	t5_2rx97	True
