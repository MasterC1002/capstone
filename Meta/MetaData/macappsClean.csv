1276176029.0	cdj2k	Quick Update – One Week In	giftedmunchkin	30	1	16	"Hey everybody! The response to this subreddit has been pretty overwhelming. I mean, I thought I would get maybe one or two subscribers, then it would be snuffed out quickly. I didn’t even think for a second we'd get close to 500 readers in less than a week! The community may be small by reddit’s standards, but we’ve got a lot of great people submitting great content – more than I could have ever dreamed.

So I wanted to quickly say thanks and say a few things. Don’t worry, this won’t be a regular update that’ll get in the way of some excellent apps, but there’s some stuff to say and some ideas to run by all you.

* Do you like the thumbnails, or should I turn them off?
* Would anyone be interested in an App of the Month? This would be determined by the “top scoring” application according to reddit, not by any single person’s personal preference. Does that seem like something any of you would like? Do you have any other ideas for how to pic the winning app?
* Any other comments, suggestions, etc. that you have?

Thanks to everyone whose subscribed or submitted - and for the latter, especially those of you who have taken the time to flesh out in the comments what really makes the app great. Here’s to another week, month, and even year of this subreddit going strong!

**EDIT** The general consensus is that an App of the Month would be great, so I'll probably launch that on June 15th, to be updated the 15th of each month. Are there any suggestions on how to pick the app, or should I stick with my original plan?

Additionally, there is an interest in an index of all the submitted apps. I like this idea, but I'm trying to figure out a practical way to implement it. Any suggestions would be appreciated."	t5_2rt9r	True
