Easter eggs:

In episode 1 there is a poster that says ""Earth"" and has a torn-out picture of the moon taped next to it, which also reappears in episode 7. If Bravest Warriors and Adventure Time happen in the same universe, then that means that Bravest Warriors is happening before Adventure Time seeing as it's been confirmed that the Land of Ooo was once earth but was destroyed by war.
http://i.imgur.com/p5Sm3Iy.jpg

In episode 1 Beth shows a hologram of their parents, but there are only 7 people. The two on the far left are most likely Chris' parents seeing as they have light hair and Chris is blond. The woman on the right holding the sword and the man holding the gun are Danny's parents, as shown in episode 8. The muscular woman is definitely Wallow's mother and I think the man with a hook and eye patch might be his father because he is balding and looks tough. But no matter who Wallow's father is, this means that Beth doesn't have a mother. She might have died or possibly ran away or Beth might have been adopted by her father alone.
http://i.imgur.com/9yfzmAU.png

In episode 1, it shows earlier versions of the Bravest Warriors going up the elevator as the group we are shown is entering. Most people probably didn't notice this.
http://i.imgur.com/ppo7HFN.png

This isn't much of an easter egg, but the other side of the space bus in episode 4 says 'HOVERFUDGE EAT IT""
http://i.imgur.com/lygkCLe.png

In episode 7 we can see some information on Wallow on his license. His birthday looks like either the 11th or 14th of February.
http://i.imgur.com/89HEZ60.png

In episode 7, Beth has a poster of Dj Snap Fancy Bone, who appeared in episode 5.
http://i.imgur.com/qVziXo0.png

In episode 9, Beth has a poster of the game Super Crate Box. A game where you shoot enemies as a small sprite character and pick up crates for new weapons and points. (It is a fun game i reccomend you play it)

ViceAdmiral	33	1	20	"So last night I updated the page to the new code, unfortunately the cool looking tab buttons didn't make it, due to browser formatting issues, and it was the same thing for emotes, but emotes are the main priority so I'm working on getting that fixed as soon as possible.

Anyways, as you can see the sub has changed around a bit, I kept most of the design from before, and mixed in some little things from the newer design, and thanks to the revised code I was able to add stuff I wasn't able to before because some things would interfere with others due to my shoddy coding.

Here's a short list of some of the stuff that *did* make it:

* Link Karma Score Color Change for better visibility

* Upvote/Downvote Buttons (Temporary)

* Self Post / Link Post Thumbnails

* All of the colors are now coordinated ex: green used in tab menu is same green in links, etc.

* Sidebar section dividers have been simplified, but there only temporary, I'm making nicer ones, it'll take time.

* Neat little image change thingy when you hover over the Bravest Warriors link in the header.

* Reverted back to Reddit default font size/style

* Reverted back to Reddit default text entry field

That's all the things I can remember adding for now.

So that's that. Again, if there is ANYTHING you're unhappy about, just write it out in the comments and I'll look into fixing it as soon as possible.

Anyways, how about that episode! 

How about Danny nipples showing though his shirt? 

And how about that strobe light party time robot?

And why does the Martian badlands have to be new Miami? Miami isn't *that* bad. I was born there, and I survived long enough to make it out of there...

So about flair....

**FLAIR ADDED:**

* Young Danny

* Laser Party Robot

* Hans Christian Teet-Phanters

* Danny's dad/mom

* Fish President

**Emotes to be added:**

So in the most recent episode it shows Ice King (Simon) and Marcelline trying to survive shortly after The Mushroom War. At the time Marcelline is 7 and Simon is 47. At one point Simon starts singing the *Cheers* theme song to Marcelline, which is a show that ended in 1993. I think the youngest he probably could have been when that show was on is 6 meaning it aired 41 years ago (47-6=41). That would make the current year 2045, and after some looking I found that Ultra Wankershim takes place in 3085.

1361593776.0	192c75	Theory about the Concierge, the Emotion Lord, and time shenanigans	hiero_	26	4	11	"I was watching Gas Powered Stick again when I realized how odd it is for the emotion lord to just suddenly appear and give Impossibear the stick. I thought about it and wondered what might have happened had Impossibear *not* received the gas powered stick: Chris would never have eaten then peach that grew out of it and received the powers he did, and in turn he more than likely never would have kissed Plum. We can almost definitely be sure this was an important chain of events that needed to occur to make sure Chris became the Emotion Lord.

We know the Concierge follows the Emotion Lord around taking notes. The Bravest Warriors wiki states that he follows the EL around taking notes of whatever he does. This is only *partially* true; he's actually taking notes on what Chris does, making sure he is on the right track to become the EL. This bit can be evidenced in the newest episode, Ultra Wankershim. The Concierge is seen standing behind Chris at the end, looking at him and his concern for Beth, and jotting down some notes before walking back through the portal with a smug look on his face. I don't know why or what his relationship with the EL truly is, perhaps there are some darker reasons at bay from the powers that be that we may not yet be aware of, and perhaps he is involved. And with the visions seen in this episode, it looks like some bad mojo is ""pre-determined"" to hit Chris someday, each piece possibly being the remaining major events that will affect him (namely whatever happens to Beth, her being with another dude).

However, *the future* ***CAN*** *be changed*.This is evidenced in Lavarinth, wherein upon taking the Vitamin B12 pill, the Emotion Lord immediately grew hair back. This means that in the Bravest Warriors universe, time does not branch off into separate timelines, but it is one fixed line that can be altered. Chris doesn't necessarily have to fulfill all of the events of the future; otherwise, why would the Concierge be taking notes to make sure he is completing each task?

Going off of that, I say this: don't be surprised if Chris comes to this realization in a future episode and makes a very important decision that changes his fate, and possibly others as well, entirely - thus, the Chris we know would never become the Emotion Lord. That said, the Emotion Lord and the Concierge might even be in antagonistic positions if this were to occur.

Basically, destinies and decisions in this show aren't set in stone and have the ability to be changed, thus creating a temporal pairosocks.


TL;DR - The Concierge and the EL are laying the seeds for Chris to become the EL, possibly for nefarious reasons, but all points on the future of the timeline can be changed. Thus, Chris may not end up becoming the EL after all (and it will probably all boil down to something like 'I didn't confess my feelings to her when I should have')

It's really crazy when you start to think about it just how contrived this show's plot is getting for a five minute long silly cartoon. Welp, I think that just about covers all of my over-analyzing cartoons for the next few months!

EDIT: I want to take this ONE step further. Just re-watched episode two and Chris yells at the Emotion Lord ""And you're the reason Danny's going to die, aren't you!"" Now, if I know one thing in my hayday of seeing this sort of thing, I know if a ruse is a distaction when I see one. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Chew on *that*."	t5_2tl4p	True

He wears the exact same suit as Chris. He knows the entire team's names. He know's Chris' destiny, and he said that Chris will gain powers in his future, just like the Emotion Lord has. (Of course, he said he was kidding at the end, but that could be yet another lie.)  He seemed to know everything Chris was going to do, and knew EXACTLY how to push his buttons and make him become overly emotional.

And perhaps the most solid piece of evidence was when Beth said ""These scans don't make sense. Chris, I think you were standing too close to him for me to get a clear reading.""  This implies that when she pointed the scanner at the Emotion Lord, Chris showed up on it instead, meaning the Emotion Lord IS Chris.

There were at least two instances in which when Plum was slightly emotional around the warriors that they would lose their memory for a few seconds before gaining it back. At one point, Beth and Wallow look at each other and shake hands saying ""nice to meet you"", and it's even pointed out that they lose their memory occasionally around Plum for some unknown reason, and no one ever seems to talk about it.

It's also plausible that whoever is her second brain is/was a memory donk.

I'll take it even a step further and wager that perhaps memory donks and emotion lords are enemies or something, which would explain Plum's odd behavior in ""Gas Powered Stick"".

Dunno if anyone has thought of this yet, but it was just an idea I came up with while reading."	t5_2tl4p	True

I was browsing Reddit when [this](http://www.reddit.com/tb/18yx27) popped up (Thanks willplaykazooforfood for making my mind wander). Since AT and BW occurs in the same universe (and solar system), will there be any cross-overs? BW is on Mars, and AT is on earth (after The Great Mushroom War), but I highly doubt they're in the same time.

Bravest Warriors is **at least** in the [31^st century (30XX)](http://www.reddit.com/r/BravestWarriors/comments/18gl2j/tomorrow_is_wallows_birthday/). When does AT occur?

I also have seen some debate on what occurs first, Adventure Time or Bravest Warriors. Back to the first link; Chris was having a **foreshadow/flash-forward** and saw the earth. This was given a clue that Adventure Time could be in the future. I think there are a couple of possible answers.

A.) Adventure Time is set in the future (after Bravest Warriors) and refuses to use the advanced technology (besides the mind-powered teleportation device)

B.) Bravest Warriors is set in the future (after Adventure Time), due to the fact that they have better technology that allows them to travel through space, have flying transportation such as cars, and even build time machines

C.) They could be in parallel universes (M-Theory/Multiverse Theory)

D.) Chris could have had a flash-back for that one split second, and then have the normal flash-forward

Other than that I probably just over thought everything ^^^:("	t5_2tl4p	True

In Dan Before Time Danny says that Beth like his lips that are ""full of juice"" and in Memory Donk before Chris can say boyfriend Danny says so and says, ""Shoot i could be your husband!"", Which could lead on that they get married and thats why future Chris was crying and said he missed her.

1362700866.0	19vnak	Bravest Warriors and Adventure Time Possible Crossover Theory.	Jeff27721	12	3	3	"Now most of you probably heard of this or thought of it yourselves, both shows are made by Pendleton Ward and a lot of fans of this show are most likely fans of Adventure Time too. I have some possible evidence that crossovers or at least references might happen at some point, not a full crossover like both shows combine into one or anything crazy, but maybe subtle references to each other. 

The first thing I have found is in episode 10 of Bravest Warriors. At 3:53 if you pause at the perfect timing you can see something familiar. [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/qtpgi0Y) Now I believe that is a reference to this (Sorry for all the links) [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/GDvjMqy) Now if you still haven't caught on I'll explain it.
The second picture I showed you is a picture of the world in Adventure Time, where a crater covers a large part of the Earth after the ""Mushroom War"". The first picture I showed you seems to be oddly like the second one, and the picture appears in the time when the emotion lord shows Chris the future. So maybe the Adventure Time world will show up in Bravest Warriors. Like I said up in the title, it is just a theory, but I'd like to think this could happen.

If you want more evidence I have one other piece. In the episode that was just released, in the ""Paralyzed Horse's Log"" (Favourite moment in the whole show for me) he said the year was 3085. Now if you remember back a bit I mentioned a ""Mushroom War"" that happened in Adventure Time. It is said that the war happened 1000 years before what we see in Adventure Time. Also in Adventure time we see many wrecked cars and police cars in the world of the dead and the underground place where Susan Strong lives that match what cars today look like. [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/8P2njfE) So if those things are ruined and everywhere then it would be assumed that the war happened then, in the early 2000s, when we live. And if you add the 1000 years of time from after the Mushroom War you get to be near the begninning of the 3000s. So if Bravest warriors and Adventure Time both take place near the same time period, and if we saw what would possibly be the Adventure Time world in a flashforward, I believe that there will be more references and maybe a small crossover to come.

TLDR; Adventure time world was seen in a flashforward in Bravest Warriors and they both take place around the same time so there is a possibility for crossovers."	t5_2tl4p	True

------------------------------------------------------

Look, he knows Chris is sloppy infatuated with her. And he wouldn't violate bro code (Source: he's the cool one **[Ep. 4]**)

but Danny *repeatedly* pushes Chris to act on his feelings. (**Ep. 3, Ep. 9**)

He's waiting for his less-cool friend to make a move. The thing is, Chris never will. 

------------------------------------------------------

Chris *thinks* he's head-over-heels for Beth. 

But if he never acts on his feelings, isn't he more afraid of rejection than in love with her?

Chris is so stuck in his own head he can't even see Danny's feelings for her. Danny flirts with her in **ep. 8**, calls her adorable in **11**, references being her husband in **4**, and dances with her in **5**.

------------------------------------------------------

Who's to say Danny doesn't care about Beth more than Chris? 

Can their affections be measured or compared?

Maybe Danny is *just as terrified* as Chris, but more willing to act on his feelings.

------------------------------------------------------

It's okay though. Chris is going to realize truly loving Beth means respecting her decisions and friend-zoning himself means he has decided that she *is not allowed* to choose a boyfriend for herself. It's going to be good for him.

Personally if BW ended up just being a prequel to adventure time I would feel let down that something so awesome was just a part of some bigger more popular show. 

Also, from what I understand about Adventure time, the main character is the last living human, implying that if BW is a prequel to Adventure time our beloved warriors will meet grizzly ends from some war. I don't know a lot about the Adventure time lore so I may be wrong, but still I would hate to see Bravest warriors try to become a part of something it doesnt need to. Anywhoseir, because I like to drum up conversation I would love to hear and discuss all your opinions on the matter. If I upset anyone with my dislike of adventure time, I am sorry.

TL;DR I LOVE bravest warriors as it's own stand alone thing and will be disappointed if it is tied to adventure time. Discuss"	t5_2tl4p	True

1363622759.0	1aj36q	I would like to file a formal complaint about the character known as 'Catbug'.	Prezombie	2	4	5	"Bugs and beetles may sometimes look similar at first glance, but they belong to two quite different insect groups. Here are some features that can help distinguish between them.

**Mouthparts**

Bugs: mouthparts modified into piercing stylet (i.e. needle-like).

Beetles: chewing mouthparts.

Catbug chews his food.

**Wings**

Bugs: wings (if present) are membranous or partially thickened.

Beetles: forewings modified to form hard, leathery coverings called elytra, hindwings membranous and fold under elytra when not flying.

Catbug's wings are clearly in the latter category. 

**Diet**

Bugs: liquid diet: mostly plant-feeders (nectar/sap), some feeders on animal fluids.

Beetles: wide range of plant and animal materials eaten.


Catbug does not subsist on liquids, and can eat many things, including peanut butter squares.

**Lifecycle**

Bugs: incomplete metamorphosis - juveniles resemble adults except smaller and lack wings.

Beetles: complete metamorphosis - larvae with hardened head, chewing mouthparts and usually have legs.

Catbug's unknown origins leave this one up to debate, but even if he is 'just' an average talking cat with wings grafted onto him, his portmanteau name would be far more accurate as Catbeetle. Retconning his name, or at least addressing this issue, would greatly improve Entomologist relations. 

Sincerely, a humble servant of the society for keeping the Orders Hemiptera and Coleoptera properly distinguished, cosigned by the order of entomologists with too much time on their hands."	t5_2tl4p	True
