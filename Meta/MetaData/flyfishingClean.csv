People are getting blocked because they aren't.  I just wanted to thank our mods for being chill and not caring at all about that, for giving us some respect, for realizing we might have that secret hole we don't want to talk about and realizing we are fisherman, we over exaggerate the weight, it is just a think we do. So seriously mods, stay awesome, I really appreciate it and I am sure almost everyone else here does.	t5_2qoeg	True

Instead, they say that's ok and that rod has a guilt-free warranty. i could literally drive over it on purpose and they'd still replace it as long as i still have the butt section to send back. I'm FLOORED. I will definitely continue to buy Orvis. No, this is not an ad, no, it's not a bot.

Just thought i'd spread the word out there to anybody thinking of buying.

Paired it up with a 10wt rod (Hey it's Alaska, I have dreams of catching a big King salmon on this thing).  

Spent a little time in the yard practicing with a piece of yarn.  Then did two fishing outings which consisted mostly of untangling line, losing a couple flies, and hooking my rain-jacket and pants.

Tonight was my third outing which had me wading the mouth of a salmon spawning stream.  Finally paydirt.  My first fish was a tiny little sculpin or as we call them here in Alaska, Double Uglies.   My second fish was a Pink salmon.  Normally when I catch Pinks trolling it's not much of a fight.  But I must say it was quite a ride on a fly rod.  

Now I'm wondering how much of an ass beating I'm going to get when the Coho salmon reach the streams here in a few weeks.  They're about 3 times the size of Pinks.

Is is time we get some of our heads together and create some r/flyfishing stickers?  
I would argue it is. Now I don't have any experience in the matter, but I'm certain we have some brilliant graphic design minds, as well as some who know how to go about having these made.
Any input would be great. I'm trying to get the ball rolling, and would definitely support any further action.


EDIT: Okay this received a very warm welcome so here I will take the lead on the stickers. WE NEED YOUR HELP!!!! We need proposed designs, on which the community will vote, and select the winner. Then, I will set up a storefront where you can buy as many as your heart desires, as well as give as much as you want to TU.

So you want to catch carp on the fly rod?

Of course you do, because it is awesome, and you want to be awesome.

First, a little primer on the fish itself.  The common carp, the golden bone, the river queen, the sewer trout, the list of names is as long as the history.

Originating in Asia, the common carp was brought to this country and heavily stocked by the federal government in the late 1800s as a food source for the quickly growing population.  They are now established in nearly every waterway in the country, and are listed as a ""naturalized species"" (much like honeybees, and horses) in much of the US.  As one of the largest minnows in the world, their diet consists of aquatic insects, larvae, bloodworms and the like.  They rely heavily on scent for feeding, with a very advanced olfactory gland, and their extremely sensitive barbels.  Even a fish build for scent feeding can be an active sight feeder; it is these opportunities that we are interested in.

The common carp is considered one for the smartest fish in the water, and can be extremely skittish.  This is one of the reasons carp on the fly is such a challenge.  An angler must watch his presentation very closely.  There are a countless number of events that will cause a fish to bolt.  Land the fly too hard? Line the fish? Wrong fly selection? Too many false casts over the fish? Fly line slaps the water?  All can result in a fish bolting.  By bolting, we're talking about gone.  Left in a cloud of mud, and likely spooking other fish in the area.  Trout can be polite about rejecting a fly, bass, tarpon, and redfish will simply ignore you.  The common carp is a spooky creature.

There is a lot of food on the bottom of a water body for carp.  They don't have to travel far for food once they find a location.  They can spend a full day picking off hellgrammites or crawfish in on a single flat. They have it pretty easy in the warm months when food is abundant.  I call it ""grazing for meat"".  This is our best opportunity to trick them.  But how is this approached?

It is important to see how these fish feed on the flats.  They tend to slowly swim along (often tailing, or even with their backs out of the water) looking to disturb crayfish, insect larvae, bloodworms, etc. (to be referred to as prey from here out).  When the prey is disturbed, it is quickly sucked into the soft mouth, and pushed back to the teeth to be crushed.

This area of disturbance is pretty small, usually less than 12"" total.  This is our target. 

That is the fish.  Now, where are they?

You've seen them.  The large carp swimming around, you've probably cast to it, but how do we find them on purpose?  Start sweating.  Chasing carp in skinny water is the beauty of it all.   When the sun is high in the sky, and the temps are even higher.  Find flats in your local lake or river, put on your polarized glasses, your hat, and get out there.  Walk the flats as slowly as possible.  You will find your target.  As the water temperature increases, the activity of their prey increases as well. 

Wait, I'm on the flats, I see fish, what should I have with me?  

Water.  Oh, yeah, and a fly rod.  I prefer a 6wt, but being underpowered going fishing is sort of my hobby.  There are advantages to my 6wt out there though.  The lighter line helps me not spook the fish, but landing one is a bit of a challenge.  This is a balance you'll have to find on your own.   There are a few requirements out on the flats though. Water (yeah, I had to say it again) a quality leader, a good drag, and backing.   Your new friend, backing.  All that comes before fly selection.

Fly selection is a bit of a religious experience for many.  And many carp fly anglers have developed their own fly for the flats (mine is the Dirty Diane, I only explain the name over beers after flats fishing, btw).  But the basic idea is simple.  The old phrase ""brown and down"" fits. (Around  a 6 or 8 hook is perfect) Getting your fly to the bottom quickly is important (of course, this is balanced with not splashing too much to spook the fish). As is the ability to track your fly once it is there.  Many bonefish flies work well, crayfish imitations, and a lot of nymphs do well.  As the carp eat anything alive they disturb, matching an exact nymph or larvae isn't usually necessary.

Putting it all together.


Ok, you're ready.  You've found fish on the flats, you have some flies in a box, you have your glasses, hat and water ready.

Once you're out there, and I mean seriously out there, you'll see carp doing several different things.  The 4 main ones are:

Sunners: (hangers)  These fish are sitting near the surface, just sort of hanging out.  Cast to them, but only because you have to as they're there.  They generally don't eat.

Cruisers: these carp are on the move, likely heading from one flat to another, cast to them also, just because they are there.  They generally eat a little more than the sunners (which is to say almost not at all).

Happy carp: these are the majority of what is caught.  Hanging out on the bottom (where ther eat) they will eat a properly presented fly.

Tailing carp:  these are actively feeding.  Nose down, tail up, they are by far the easiest to catch, as they are expecting prey to be flushed out.  They are also the most likely to move further for your fly.  

Keep your distance.  We've mentioned how spooky they are, stomping around in the water isn't going to help you and.  Stay as far away as you can with your casting ability.  When it comes time to cast, think of a dinner plate in front of the carp.  This is your target.  You will want your fly to move through this area.  Sometimes landing man it is ok, however, a little past and crawling it into the zone is better.  The best cast is from 90 degrees from he fish (as it is harder to see you, and harder to line the fish) but take any shot you have.  I tend to crawl the fly across the bottom in very long slow strips (very few pauses).  You'll need to keep your fly in sight, as you will see the take. If  you do everything well enough, the carp will suck your fly up, and likely spit it out almost instantly as it will not taste right.  This is why seeing your fly and the fish are so important.  A strip set is all that is needed.  As soon as he eats, a quick strip set and you should be hooked up.

This is where your drag and backing come into use.  The carp has a very soft mouth, and it is very to pull a hook with too much force.  Set your drag appropriately for this, and you should have a blast.

1372054565.0	1gycy0	I'm pretty stoked that I caught my first fish (two beautiful little rainbow trout) ever on a fly rod today! just wanted to share with someone	jimbojonesFA	33	4	13	I don't have any pictures, unfortunately my phone was dead, but the first was about a 7 or 8 inch rainbow trout on a dry royal coachman fly, and the second was about a 3 or 4 inch rainbow on the same fly. Holy crap, that felt great. For the first one i threw a few casts upstream and as soon as my fly hit the water i saw the fish jump and hit, i was so shocked i reacted too slowly and it got of the hook two casts later boom hooked him. A hundred times more exciting way to catch a fish in my honest opinion. Just wanted to share this with someone, since most of my friends don't really care too much about fly fishing, or fishing in general really.	t5_2qoeg	True

1363129873.0	1a6gke	From the Mods:  Blog posts, spam, and the communities thoughts on the topic	beer_engineer	25	1	18	"Edit:
Here's our official decision:

**We want /r/flyfishing to be an environment where posting new and interesting content is encouraged.  We also want our content to be something we can all discuss, especially with the OP who brought up the topic.  Blog links where the author never returns are going to be considered spam and removed.**

**To link your blog, which is still allowed and encouraged, it must be linked in a self post, and linked in the post, not the title.  We request the poster to summarize their post and encourage discussion with the subreddit community.  The blog must be linked in the post only.**


Original post that brought us to this change:

Us mods here at /r/flyfishing like to keep ourselves in the background and let the community downvote content they don't like.  This keeps the content from being too heavily controlled and moderated, which is how I think we'd all like to see things.

As of late, more and more blogs are being posted over and over by certain members.  This normally wouldn't be a problem, provided the author sticks around to discuss the topic.  But we're getting a lot of ""hit and runs,"" and the flags/complaints from the community are starting to escalate.  

Given that most of these blog posts, which are becoming daily occurrences, don't see much in the way of discussion, what does the community think?

From the mods point of view, we think that creating a guideline making the blog post and topic in to a discussion.  This would require some extra legwork from the author to stick around and keep the discussion going.  Simply posting and leaving it over and over is spam, simply put.

Now, on to what you all think.  We'll take action based on the consensus of everyone here."	t5_2qoeg	True

She will start the AMA on Thursday, but plans to check back on the following days to answer more questions that may have come up.

I see a lot of folks asking questions here about fly-fishing their local waters. The BEST place to get this information (in fact, most information) is at your local fly shop, if you have one. 

I know that all you young'uns are used to using teh Internets for research, but it's no substitute for the knowledge of local guides and anglers. Fly shops do a lot more than sell stuff. A good fly shop is like a clubhouse, a meeting place, repository of local knowledge, and center of expertise. At most of them, all you have to do is buy a few flies or tippet, and they'll tell you anything you want to know. Don't be afraid. Those guys are there to help. 

When I travel to northern Maine every year, I always stop in at what I call the “Tiffany’s of fly shops” and buy a few overpriced flies and tippets. The combination of the shop’s remote location and the short fishing season on local waters means that the owner has to survive on about four months of business. I’m willing to drop a few extra bucks because I’d hate to go up there and find that there is NO fly shop within fifty miles. I consider it an investment in my own angling experience."	t5_2qoeg	True

One thing this subreddit could use more than anything is a ""getting started"" or ""FAQ"" type resource.  As with any fly fishing discussion board on these interwebs, people just getting in to the sport seek us out for advice on their new journey.  Since all (most) ask many of the same questions, putting together a comprehensive list of helpful links and information will help greatly in getting them going, and if anything, just helping them to ask the right questions.

This is a large project that will take a lot of information on a lot of topics.  Rather than trying to keep track of getting hit from all angles with bits and pieces of information from everyone, I have a strategy...

My plan is to work out an outline based on my years in getting new people in to the sport.  Once this outline is complete, possibly filled out with some of my own suggestions and info, I will post it and ask for public comment and contributions.

Does this method work for everyone?  Once a starting point is posted, it will be fully a community endeavor.  Just seemed like a lot to get going from scratch without at least some kind of start first.

Moved to Colorado a few years back and I finally decided I have to learn to fly fish... got my rod, practiced casting in the back yard using a tiny piece of bright felt and targeting my dog's toys - I can make the fly go exactly where I want... 

Looked up the current hatch in the creek I wanted to fish, decided to use a Parachute Adams... But I got out on the creek today and realized [I have no idea what I'm doing](http://qkme.me/3p3ke6)

Youtube videos were awesome at teaching me how to cast, how to tie a nail knot etc... but not so much on what to do after the cast.

So what do you do? 

Do you cast upstream or down stream?

Do you cast past the fish and just let it drift? How long?

Do you jiggle it around like you would a spinner? 

Do you just drop the fly on top of where you think fish are, or just short of? 

Do you reel it back in, or just roll another cast out when it drifts past where you want it?

Does the color of my fly line effect the fish? Should I use a darker color or lighter?

How long should I stay in one spot? Should I always be moving? 

When I do move should I be walking upstream or down?

Should every cast be in a different spot or just keep hitting the same one?

Thanks for any help. Even without catching a single fish today... Fly casting is so much more fun than spinner casting... Had a blast."	t5_2qoeg	True

1338923865.0	umjfz	Catch and release discussion:  Let's discuss the topic and educate one another	beer_engineer	20	0	38	"A recent picture post sparked a bit of a debate on catch and release.  I figured moving it in to its own topic would prove more beneficial to effectively covering the topic and making it informative.

My personal stance:  Catch and release is a great, often beneficial, necessary thing.  Many fisheries, especially with wild, naturally reproducing stocks of desirable game fish (whether indigenous or introduced) will greatly benefit from the release of that fish to live, reproduce, and provide angling opportunities down the road.

Catch and release is not always necessary, beneficial, or even the legal thing to do in every situation, however.  During my younger days, I bought in to ""release everything you catch"" philosophy.  As I gained more experience, and learned the intricacies of different fisheries, my opinion on this changed drastically.  Whether the fishery is overrun with an invasive species that competes with native stocks, a species blowing up in population out of control, a very healthy stock where sport angling take will not effect the escapement of spawning (the pink salmon runs near me fall in this category), anadramous (sea run) hatchery released fish that must be removed prior to the wild fish spawn, or is just a put and take fishery etc.  There is no blanket statement for when and where C&amp;R is the right thing to do.

The most important thing:  Educate yourself on the species, and fishery in which you are fishing.  Follow the laws, and do what will be best for that particular fishery.  And take home some hard earned meat when you can!

Edit:  Things you can do to increase the survival rate of fish - 

- For trout:  Don't fish when the water temperatures are high (above 60-65f, depending on where you are).  Trout are a coldwater fish, and warm temperatures put increased stress on them, and make them more vulnerable to infections.

- If you use a net, avoid knotted nylon nets.  These cause injury and abrasions to fish while removing their protective membrane layer.  Try to acquire catch and release friendly nets.

- Never put fish, especially trout, on dry ground (for the same reason as the knotted nets)

- Never put your fingers in a fish's gill plates.  Many anglers are drawn to this as a handle, but it will seal that fish's fate after you touch the inside of the gill plate.

- Don't squeeze the fish

- Use barbless whenever possible

- Use properly sized equipment, and never prolong a fight longer than necessary.  Long fights cause lactic acid buildups in the fish's muscles, and can lead to increased mortality.

- If you're going to do a dead fish picture, make it awesome: http://i.imgur.com/TtINo.jpg (me with an illegal-to-release hatchery steelhead)

I sent my fly about 10 ft. in front of me, started twitching it back towards me, as it's 2 ft. away this duck swims up quickly and bites the fly. I tried to pull it in fast enough but alas, I hooked the duck by the tongue. I was in shock for a second, I didn't know what to do, an old man came over and started yellin' at me, dunno why. Then a bigger duck came outta nowhere and started trying to help/murder the hooked duck. Now there's this huge commotion going on in front of me. A duck fight, an angry yelling old man, &amp; a duck on the end of my line. After a minute or two, I tried to reach down to unhook the duck, just as I do, the fly pops out of the ducks tongue &amp; it went swimming away quacking it's ass off.

Thanks!

**Edit:** Sorry. I didn't see the FAQ before posting this. There is a lot of info in there ,so I guess what I am asking is more about what basic necessities I need to get started. In other words, what is the least amount of equipment I need to actually go out fishing?

**2nd Edit:** This is a lot to take in. Thank you all for your time.

I haven't fished since I was a little kid, with my grandpa. Mainly lake fishing off a dock for whatever was in the water. I did go once with a roommate in college to Boyer Dam on the Snake River and fish for steelhead.

**I have a Reddington, Red Fly 2, 9'0"", #5 rod/reel outfit.** Other than that, I got about ten random flies and a pair of knee high rubber boots I use for work. Plus, [this](http://www.amazon.com/Washingtons-Central-Cascades-Fishing-Guide/dp/0965211622) book on where to go in the area.

I just want to get out on the water, so whatever is running now is what I will fish for. 

Any other questions I missed bellow?

I work for a documentary production company and we want to help Frank Moore go fly fish in France. In short, Frank is 90yrs old, he was a D-day Veteran, received French Legion Medal of Honor, then came home to Oregon after the war and became a local legend on the North Umqua River in Oregon, helping build and care for the renowned Steamboat Inn. Recently, he was inducted into the Fresh Water Fishing Hall of Fame. 

Now, in the later years of life, he's expressed a life dream of returning to Normandy with his wife to fly fish those same rivers he once crossed as a GI with a gun but now with a flyrod. We want to help make it happen and follow along to film the experience. Watch a short video trailer about the project here:  https://vimeo.com/56064055

So, I'm here to ask- do you know of any flyfishing, veteran, outdoor, or river conservation proponents or organizations who would be interested in supporting the project? Frank is a hell of a guy, a good fisherman and one worth making an effort to make a life dream come true. Everyone on our team has been personally inspired and challenged by him and we're trying to chase any and all leads to help make this happen. 

If you're interested in more info, we made a fundraiser page with more of his story and details in the link below. Thanks for reading.

1365097558.0	1bo9rg	Are the reasons that you love fly fishing as ethereal as mine are?	dexreddit	19	4	16	"Last week, I wanted to write a blog post for work about fly fishing and the intended audience was people who don't fly fish or even people that don't know anything about fly fishing. I wanted to try and portray why it is that I am willing to spend so much time and money on this ""hobby"". 

The reasons that I love fly fishing have always been pretty ethereal for me though. I could never quite put my finger on it. Catching fish is cool, but that's not why I love it. Tying flies is cool, but that's not why I love it. 

Anyways, through writing the article, I ended up realizing that I love the immersion into nature that fly fishing gives me. Not only do I fish some very scenic streams, but I also end up having to learn about local insects and their life cycles, fish species and spawning patterns. 

It's a very personal thing, but I would love to hear what it is that you guys love about fly fishing! [If you like, you can read my article here.](http://theglenngroup.com/about/people/tomduffy/fly-fishing-and-fly-tying-in-reno)

Mine:  that summer run steelhead (pacific northwest), bite best in the morning, and go off the bite in the afternoon.

This is the opposite of the case, and it's usually because novice steelheaders are typically drawn to the wrong type of water.  The myth also includes that summer steelhead hold in deep dark pools to stay out of the sun.  The truth is that these pools are warm and low in oxygen, only being preferred by steelhead early in the morning, before they move to shallower water in the sunlight.

In low, clear summer flows, on sunny days, steelhead will be holding in shallow water, typically just a few feet deep at most, at the heads of runs where the water is broken.  This water will be holding the most oxygen, and is typically the coolest area for them to hold.

I've caught more steelhead in bright, bluebird, mid afternoon conditions than anything else."	t5_2qoeg	True

I went wading by myself at a very small stream yesterday after work. It seemed like it was gonna be a slow day of fishing as I hadn't caught anything on the way up to a deep hole that I know holds smallmouths. I tied on a small black popper and thought I would throw it in a bit and turn back. I waded into the pool about waist deep, and after several casts I lay it right next to a submerged stump and get a taker. I can't really tell you the surge of adrenaline I got when this lunker started pulling trying to get back up under that stump. I played the fish out into the middle of the relativly small pool and it made a run for another log on the other side. I never even got it on the reel, I played it with line in hand letting it out when I felt it was pulling hard enough to break my 8lb test tippet. It made a big jump up out of the water right before I landed it, and my heart was racing thinking that it could very well spit the small fly I had used out. This was the most awesome thing to happen to me in a long time. I took some pics, and released it to swim another day."	t5_2qoeg	True

'back in the day' (a year ago) I [made a post](http://www.reddit.com/r/flyfishing/comments/jcjka/what_would_rflyfishing_like_to_see_on_a_logo/) as a regular member of the sub. The post asked the r/flyfishing community what we would all like to see on a logo. I didn't have time to do any design at the time, but our resident member HAWG did a few designs and came up with [this alien](http://i.imgur.com/wm15e.jpg). 

When the moderation changes took place the header change happened pretty fast. I AM NOT trying to insult anyone here... but I think the community should have gotten a say before that change was made, and should get another say now in what's in the header of our sub. I messaged thee a year ago regarding making this change or making me a mod so I could change the CSS (I'm a professional web developer), but the change of moderation recently was my first chance, and before I knew it there was another header image already! 

  

* I invite everyone to submit designs for the logo, or comment on the one I linked above made by HAWG.


**EDIT: The public have spoken! We can always change the header again. I will talk to the other mods to see what they think.** 

**EDIT 2: Now just waiting on a transparent version, header will be changed tonight August 7th**

* If you don't tie your own flies but are looking for a budget friendly alternative to buying them, try searching online! Don't let this completely replace going to your local fly shop, just know some great deals can be had.

* If you're just starting out, a lot of the major manufacturers have noteworthy advice on their websites. Some even have videos! Also, google sexyloops.

* If you're out fishing, try to put some space between yourself and any other fishermen that happen to be doing the same thing as you.

edit: Great advice everyone! Keep it coming!"	t5_2qoeg	True

A plethora of bugs on the water, including 3 different sized sulphurs, blue winged olives, small and large rusty spinners, isonychias, caddis and more.  As long as you tied on something that looked good and you got a good drift over a rising fish they would take almost anything.  I got fish from 14"" all the way to 20"", at least one of each size.  The 20"" fish was not the biggest brown I've ever gotten, but he was definitely one of the best.  A pig of a fish with a huge hooked jaw and incredible girth.  Fishing has been excellent so far this year, hopefully the flows stay good for the summer. 

Here are a couple pictures.  The first one is 19"", didn't think I would get anything better but then about 20 minutes later I hooked the 20"" fish.

Ok, well I haven't actually seen it, but I have heard references to it and I did watch a couple of videos on YouTube and really how hard can it be? 10 o-clock, stop, 2 o'clock, stop, don't bend your wrist, wait for the line to travel, nice smooth movements. I've got this, oh how I've got this.

Like all things that I get interested in, I tend to jump in first, flounder around for a bit, and then after much cursing and swearing, I begin to actually do some research on what the hell it is I'm trying to attempt. So it goes with fly fishing.

Beautiful weekend, no plans, figured I'd grab the rod, head somewhere close to home and give this fly fishing thing a try. Why, I could hear the trout already sizzling in my frying pan, and smell them as they roasted on my barbecue. By god, I was a fly fisherman and I was going to bring home one of those wily trout. A little research shows that they stocked Sanctuary Pond in Hastings Park and it's a mere 10 blocks from home, here was to be my hunting grounds. Here, I was to prove myself the graceful, yet mighty fly fisher.

Holy sweet spaghetti monster, first cast and I'm already tangled up in the bushes behind me. Spend time untying everything from the bushes. Give the bushes my best hairy eyeball, and turn to cast again. Out goes my line, in long graceful loops, pulling line, I can feel the rhythm as I get the line going, and then, I damn near yank my arm out of the socket as I hook into a tree behind me. WTF!

10 feet off the ground and surrounded by thorns of immeasurable size, I can see the Gordian Knot my line has tied around the branch and my fly, sitting proudly on a branch, moons me with glee knowing that it won't be returning to the water any time soon. Sigh, get in as close as I can, untangle/untie as much as possible and realize that I'm going to have to cut the line. Swearing and a few curse words. Then a few more curse words. Then a Mom and her kid show up so I stop swearing out loud and mutter under my breath, while giggling once in awhile. I think that kind of freaked them out, so they left. Who knew muttering and giggling quietly to yourself would unnerve some people? 

Managed to stand on the fishing dock at just the right angle so that I can cast without getting caught on the trees behind me, get so impressed with myself that, I strike a pose, immediately hit myself in the back of the head with the fly, it embeds itself, but thankfully not deeply. So one fly that took it's earliest opportunity to escape my grasp and one that has just drawn blood, it's on fly box, oh, it's on.

I manfully struggled with my line, with those bushes and I even caught the dock and the bottom of the pond a couple of times but those trout were not to be found. I packed my rod away and slunk home, defeated.

This is when I decided to do a little more research, roll casting....hmmm. So there is a way to cast without getting tangled on crap behind you. That would've come in handy sooner. Hmmmm....a recommendation to maybe spend some time at the park doing some dry land training. I live within a block of a park. So 2 hours spent yesterday casting, roll casting, casting some more. Still have a long way to go, but eventually I'll bring home a fish!"	t5_2qoeg	True

1367015291.0	1d6lqw	Yellowstone Rod Shootout is a joke	notmy_realusername	15	1	10	"Every year, people take this Yellowstone shootout stuff as gospel.  As if it's actually something to measure rods by.  The past few years, I've started to notice a pattern.  They endorse rods they carry and want to make money on.  They slam rods they don't carry.  Examples:

A few years ago, they praised Albright rods as their winner for the shootout.  Gave the rod high marks on everything.  The next year, they give them a mention as not even being good enough to rank.  The difference?  That one year they carried Albright, the next year they didn't.

This year, they crossed the line.  Clutch is a company I've come to like quite a bit.  Had a chance to meet the guys at a fly fishing show in Somerset NJ, and cast their ruds.  They are fast, but anything but ""club like"" and abysmal like they say in this review.  I am in no way affiliated with Clutch, but I think it's seriously shitty when Yellowstone takes time to slam a company, a new American made company, like they have here.  The reason is simply because they don't carry them.  They've done the same thing to Allen, Albright, and now Clutch.  All of which make great products, but don't make the paycheck for Yellowstone angler.

Look at the list of the winners, and look at what they carry.  It's no coincidence.  I think it's time these assholes get called out publicly for the BS they post as a real contest.

Yesterday when I went fishing I left the phone (and camera) at home, and I only took one rod (normally I take two). I find many people (myself included) have visions of grandeur holding trophy fish in front of the camera. As good as that sounds, we often get too caught up in replying to emails, text messages, and taking pictures while on the stream. With all that going on it's hard to not be distracted while fishing. Now, I'm not saying you can't catch nice fish when you have a camera with you, I'm just saying sometimes it's nice to simplify and concentrate on a single goal, *just fishing*.    

    
Yesterday I had one of the more memorable days fishing in quite some time, and my fishing time wasn't interrupted by any connection to civilized life. The streamer bite was ON and I caught quite a few fish. Sometimes it's nice to get back to your roots, try leaving the camera / cell phone in the car sometime, and let your memory take the pictures. You'll spend more time fishing and have just as much fun! Tight lines everyone, have a nice weekend."	t5_2qoeg	True
