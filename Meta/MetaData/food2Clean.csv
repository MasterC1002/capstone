It makes a big point that large corporations are driving the price they pay per kilo down, but it never really gave a clear ""This is what you should do"". 

I already buy many of my vegetables from a (local CSA)[http://www.eatwiththeseasons.com/] but something like coffee isn't grown locally. I bought a bag of ""local"" coffee, but after I clearly read the label, it is roasted locally, but the beans are coming from Colombia, Mexico and Indonesia. 

I was looking into ""FairTrade"" tagged food, but I have seen people talking about fair trade doesn't really mean anything anymore, in the same way that ""cage free"" eggs don't really mean that the chickens are in a better situation. 

So, long story short, for coffee, or for anything that is packaged and imported for that matter, how do I vote with my dollar? What should I be looking for on packaging? Or does anyone have any brands/stores they frequent that they know have a good track record of supporting smaller farmers?"	t5_2rk27	True

I know labels like ""organic"", ""natural"", etc, are essentially meaningless, and obviously company websites are going to give information biased in their favor. I can do research on individual companies, but it can take quite a while to compile useful information - it seems really impractical for one person to do this for all the food they buy, and all the restaurants they visit.

I am not strictly vegetarian, but I tend to avoid meat because it seems to me that meat production is one of the most problematic parts of the food industry. I think this is the most effective first step I can take - but I would like to do more, if possible. I'm aware that buying packaged products in a grocery store sort of puts a limit on how much I can improve my buying habits, but I hope I can make some improvements within that constraint.

So, I would love to find a website that lists comprehensive, well-researched information about the production practices of food companies and restaurants. Things like the use of pesticides, hormones, antibiotics; whether meat is grass-fed or not (and basically anything else related to sustainabie/organic/whatever food production) I'm envisioning a simple table of companies and their practices. Does anything like this exist?

Okay, that's just what happened when I tried to go local and sustainable.  I got frustrated with the lack of ability to search by ingredients or find recipes that were in season.  So I decided to create my own.  

To start, it's just a basic recipe sharing site.  One that tries to take the best of what exists in various community sites on the web.  That's as far as I've gotten for the moment.  Recipe sharing, image based, vote rating, reputation and ribbons, tagging and an ingredient search engine.  I started with those features because I thought those were the ones that the most people were likely to use.  With them I hope to build up a good database of recipes and community of cooks.

Once that database is built, I can start adding more features aimed at living and eating locally and sustainably.  There's already to ability to browse the ingredients on the site.  I want to make them user editable for users with enough reputation.  And then add the ability to put in seasonality information for each ingredient.  So when looking at a recipe, you can see whether or not an ingredient is in-season or you.  Next, I want to add a sister site (or sub-site) with profiles for farms, farmer's markets, local small groceries or food producers, that sort of thing.  So when you click on an ingredient, you can get a list of places to get it locally.  

The hope is to provide a tool that takes some of the research effort out of eating locally and sustainably and makes it easier for people with less time.  And better yet, if the base features of the site are themselves useful, maybe people who had no intention of living sustainably will end up doing so just because its that easy.  

What do you think?  Of both the idea, and the current beta execution?  Is this a site you could help build, by adding recipes+photographs, voting and by maintaining ingredients and tags?

tl;dr Fridge to Food (http://www.fridgetofood.com) is a website I wrote while trying to eat locally and sustainably to make it easier.  It's in beta, looking for feedback and people to start using it so I can see what works and what doesn't."	t5_2rk27	True

I help manage a farmers' market on Saturday mornings doing the administrative goodness and directing traffic and all the other fun stuff that goes along with a market of that size (7,000-10,000 patrons). This morning, a professor from the University in town offered extra credit to her students that were willing to meet her at the market and do a scavenger hunt of sorts; it was a 100 lvl intro course of sorts. She had upwards of about 30 students in the course. What really got me though was the reason:

In the discussions, the undergrads were disgusted by buying from a farmer instead of a grocery store because nothing would be clean and everything would be dirty. If the food didn't come from a factory or wasn't processed it was unsafe.

Because of these, I've started to scale back in the processed foods in everyday life and increasing in the basic foods that aren't processed. Also, because of ""Food Matters"" I've started taking an interest in raw foods. 

Anyone have any others I should watch? Any input on how to find better food that's fairly easy to prepare for a raw diet?

I'm considering buying fresh local fish when the opportunity arises (we see family at the beach fairly often) and freezing it. Does this seem like a reasonable plan?

1283910656.0	daw21	My CSA has been providing produce of decreasing quality over the past few weeks - Any advice?	admrltact	6	0	5	"My wife and I signed up for a half share in the local CSA for the spring season with the option to expand to the full year later. While we initially saw a lot of random greens, we were fairly happy what we were receiving - all of the greens were fairly healthy, insect free. With some creative culinary skills (half the fun of the CSA) we were able to use the majority of what we received. Happy with this we went ahead and signed up for the remainder of the year. 

Flash forward through summer when corn started to come in. We got a few bunches of corn that had ear worms in it a few weeks in a row. The next few weeks the corn was absent, and the returned worm free. This didnt last long and now along with some random produce, the bulk of our CSA box has been earworm infested corn, and more recently [peach tomatoes](http://www.backyardgardener.com/plantname/pda_64c6-2.html) which also appear to have significant insect damage. 

 I feel like we cant be the only ones dissatisfied with the quality of the produce received. I don't want to be rude, as I know they don't want to disappoint by not having food and don't want to send crap. My wife and I are just frustrated with having to throw out produce that probably shouldn't have been sent? 

What is the best way to approach this to our CSA? Has anyone else had similar problems? Are we just overreacting? Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated.

Sounds like a great idea, we all thought but then there's that perishable fact we all have to deal with.

Should we give up?
Nope, not even in the least bit. 
A better idea should be brought to our attention.

Allowing anyone to sell their organic foods (not produce) over the Internet to anyone over the world. I have experienced first hand that organic foods last a little longer than organic produce and having everyone have the ability to sell their food over to the Internet like a giant 24/7 farmer's marketplace would be best avenue to take.

I have found a great deal of information on sites like Backyard Aquaponics and I have a textbook on recirculating aquaculture systems but I haven't really found any specific examples in Southern California. I was wondering if there was anybody out there that had a set up in Southern California and wouldn't mind answering a few questions.
