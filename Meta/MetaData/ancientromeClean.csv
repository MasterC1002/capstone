This was a title first started by the second king of Rome, Numa Pompilius, in the mid-600s BCE, as the head of the Roman state religion.

It was an important position through republican Rome, as Romans took their religion very seriously, and was a title held by Julius Caesar during his rise to power. Following the fall of the Republic, the title was transferred to Augustus as he consolidated power, and from then on the emperors held that title until the mid-4th century.

As the empires split into west and east, the title was transferred to the bishop of Rome after emperor Theodosius I made Christianity the official Religion of the Roman Empire. As the empire collapsed into the middle ages, the popes unofficially retained this title, and became part of their claim to power as the Catholic church became the last inheritors of Roman tradition as Europe fractured.

The title was unofficially retained but always applied to the pope from then on.

So as a new pope is elected, they retain a title created more than 2,600+ years ago and held almost continuously by some of the most  powerful people in history."	t5_2s8l1	True

Seeing how the wars went, how they battled, and moved, and how their daily lives were. What they thought about it and stuff, i would do a lot of research to try and make it as historical as possible, but make it fiction in a soldiers eyes.

So would anyone be interested in reading something like this? I know people should write because they want to, but i have tried to write before and i didnt like it because i didnt get any opinions on where i should get better.

The trouble I've been having is picking something that is both meaningful, not overly elaborate (aka I don't want multiple sessions) and aesthetically pleasing.

* I've considered a simple SPQR on my upper arm but I'm not sure I like the parallels with Gladiator.
* I've also been looking for Roman pattern or a sign of a Roman God that I could use. I'm an atheist and I'd happily wear a sign for pagan Roman deity. 
* I've also considered getting an Aquila tattooed on my lower arm; haven't picked which legion yet. 
* The final thought I've had is ""M·AGRIPPA·L·F·COS·TERTIUM·FECIT"" which is the dedication on the Pantheon. I like it because it's such a simple yet beautiful reminder of how while life is short, our work and reputation can live in on thousands of years later.

Any other suggestions or ideas? Have any of you got some work done already that you'd be willing to let me steal?

Oh and let's get this out of the way: Yes tattoos were probably derided in Rome itself. But times change and we must pay tribute in a way appropriate to our culture."	t5_2s8l1	True

1352435278.0	12wc95	A movie about Late Republican Politics but, like Coriolanus, set in modern times	thomin	39	3	10	"[Coriolanus](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1372686/) is a fascinating movie, based on a Shakespeare play based on a story from early Roman History. It is Rome, but as it it was a modern city. The senate works the same way, the army, there are patricians and plebians and so on. I highly recommend checking it out. It is really awesome to see the workings of the Republic set in a modern city, as well as the military scenes, as brief as they are.

I am a Classics major and have studied Late Republican politics for the past few years, and nothing would please me more than to see a movie about Late Republican Rome in [this style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsYrGIQnmxo). Perfect would be a movie like this about Cicero. It would encompass the first triumvirate and some of the second, the Gallic wars (not directly), the Catiline conspiracy, the Verres trial, Cicero's consulship (and his other offices - thus we could see all of the workings of the Late Republican Politics) and more. Or even a movie about Caesar, which would be full enough of military and political scenes. Augustus also would be amazing, or at least more specifically up to Actium. 

Seeing Rome displayed as a modern city, with all of the same elements it had in antiquity is really neat and I want more! Would this interest anyone else?

I'm currently working on the first novel of a planned historical fiction trilogy on the year of the four emperors.  The novels will be in a rotating point of view format where each chapter focuses on a different character.  The first book starts with the death of Nero, and will end shortly after the death of Galba with the Rhine legions in full on revolt.

As it stands now I've got a POV character list as long as my arm, and it's looking to be a huge project (early guess work is showing a length of 120,000 to 150,000 words for the first book).  I won't give the full list of characters here, but needless to say major players like Galba, and Otho, as well as the people connected to them such as Vinius, Icelus, Laco, and Paulinus will be included.  Others I've decided to make into major characters are people like [Sempronius Densus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sempronius_Densus) (whom I'm having a hard time not thinking of as a carbon copy of Lucius Vorenus from HBO's Rome), and Statius Murcus, one of Piso's assassins.

I thought I'd ask what you folks thought, and what perspectives/ideas you'd like to see covered in such a project.  I'm also toying with the idea of doing a free limited reader serial release as I write and complete chapters.  Would anyone be interested in such a thing?     "	t5_2s8l1	True

1303122566.0	gsnql	Hey Reddit, why were Trajan and Hadrian so different in their expansion and consolidation of the empire?	Blasphemous_Cat	25	4	5	"Here's what I know:

Trajan was the first since Augustus to expand the borders of Rome (Dacia and the East). Big time expansionist.

Hadrian, upon ascension, almost immediately abandoned the conquest of the East and emphasised consolidating the boarders of Rome. He built a bunch of walls, as well as fortifications along the Rhine and Euphrates.

My question is, why such a change in policy?

I've always been curious about this, but I've yet to find an answer. Everything I read just tells me that Trajan was a badass soldier and Hadrian was really into art and culture.

As for other explanations, all that comes to mind is the massive level of debt Hadrian inherited (900 million sesterces), but not really, since he just ignored it* and continued travelling and building merrily.

*""On coming to Rome he cancelled the debts that were owing to the imperial treasury and to the public treasury of the Romans""

After each of the early Emperors died, why were more embraced rather than the obvious decision to restore the Republic?	wassworth	25	3	17	"You'd think that after basing your entire history on a deeply-rooted hatred and distrust of all things King-like, after Caeser was killed the Republic would be restored without any second thoughts. It's not like the Republic was beyond everyone's memory. And if Rome was in the midst of civil war and the conflict between Octavian and Mark Antony was inherent and someone would take power regardless, then why not after Augustus' reign was the Republic restored? Why not after Tiberius or especially Caligula? Why not after the end of the Julio-Claudians? 

It seems like it didn't take long at all for the Romans to forget their heritage and begin acting as if having a single powerful Emperor step into power was the obvious and typical thing to do - rather than something completely abhorred. 

So, at what point did the Romans stop hating regality and proceed to not even stop to question it, and why? What great cultural and mental shift happened?

I intend on making 3 -4 seasons of an animated series I will call Raging Romans, which will be as much an in depth exploration of legionary equipment, to an introduction to the basics, and a clarification of elements in the Roman army that caused alot of confusion. There will be 4 episodes per month. A 20 minute Main episode, a 3 minute ‘quick’ episode, a DIY and a ‘clarifications’ episode a few minutes long which will be feedback and corrections to whatever I have presented incorrectly 
In the early days of my Roman obsession I used to get angry (seriously) that one movie called their soldiers Roman and had chain mail and yellow round helmets, while other movies called their soldiers romans, and they were all in plate armor and complex helms. The problem is that I didnt understand the development of the army, the now obvious difference between a late republican legionary in montefortino helmet verses a lorica segmentata clad Dacian war veteran were lost, only because most websites said there was a 'gap' but never showed this visually.
I want to explore the lesser known elements of the roman Panopy, why things (like shields) changed and explore odd ideas like why historical correctiveness matters in movies, and what movies got things right. This will be as much fun as informative and Im hoping it gives someone the answers they need, or enough knowledge and direction to look for more.
We will also be doing DIY episodes for tunic making, ration recipes and more.
At the moment I have multiple questions, some include
- Why did the Roman Shield Change
- Did soldiers really wear crests
-what colour is my tunic
-Ode to the Montefortino (these will be episodes dedicated to one item)


TLDR - If you have ANY question about Rome, her soldiers and their armor, especially something you were embarrassed about or thought people would scoff at, please ask here and we'll consider it for an episode and answer what we can now.

Also anything that covers Hannibal's battles in more detail and his roamings around Italy would be most welcome as I'm particularly interested in the military aspect, and apart from Cannae, Trebia and Trasimine the details can be somewhat sparse.

(x-post from r/history)	true_grit	25	5	8	"I wondered while reading about the [battle of Munda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Munda) 45 BCE in which manner those two noble Roman citizens were executed by their enemies - [Gnaeus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnaeus_Pompeius) 45 BCE by Caesar's orders, [Sextus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sextus_Pompey) 35 BCE by Mark Antony's orders.

From what I've read Gnaus was caught and then tried for treason, Sextus was executed without a trial. I seek to know which death was them consequently ""granted"" in these situations. They clearly weren't allowed to die by their own hands, was it then death by the sword, beating/stoning, a dishonorable death as crucifixion? Who has sources?

Thanking you in advance for your efforts!

- Soranus talks about conception

In order that the offspring may not be rendered misshapen, women must be sober during coitus because in drunkenness the soul becomes the victim of strange fantasies...


- Plutarch on bathing with women 

Men should not cleanse their skin in the women’s bath. Men must not be naked together with women. In addition to the indecency, certain effluvia issue from women’s bodies and excretions which are defiling when absorbed by men: anyone who enters the same air or water partakes of them.


- Aristotle tells us about menstruation 

In the case of very clean mirrors, if a woman who is menstruating looks into the mirror, the mirror’s surface becomes bloody-dark, like a cloud. It isn’t easy to wipe off the stain if the mirror is new, but if it is old, it is easier.

But I havent been able to find very much. I have found a lot of incomplete info. Articles are about specific gestures,postures or finger gestures. But that info is coming from many sources and all over the internet. I haven't been able to find a complete (or illustrated) list. It is very much a scavenger hunt and a frustrating one.

Anywho, my question is about a specific gesture/posture. It can be seen [here on an episode of Rome.](http://youtu.be/WHHf7xVeuY0?t=29s) Its been my understanding that Rome did use period correct gestures and postures for all of their oratorical scene. Especially those of the news reader. The gesture/posture in question is pretty much over with at the 40 second mark. 

If anyone knows the name of the gesture/posture , I would love you until the end of time. Once I know its name I'm sure I can continue my quest to learning about it. But if you want to tell me a little bit about said gesture/posture that too would be welcomed.

Obviously, I think we can all agree that he was an incredible general and charismatic leader. But do what do you think of his goals, his actions? Do you find him a respectable figure, one that could be an excellent role model? Or do you believe him to be a greedy and evil man, and the slayer of Roman Republicanism?

Personally, I find Caesar to be a political inspiration. Not to say that I wish to end democracy, but his abilities to understand and command the political realm around him, and lead his men to be incredibly inspiring. Furthermore, I am of the theory that Caesar did not establish a permanent dictatorship in Rome so that he would control it, but I think his goals could have been a bit more benevolent (though the desire for power was still a factor).

The ruling class and the Senate in Rome at the time was utterly spineless, weak, and corrupt. I think Caesar hoped to establish a dictatorship so that, over time, Rome could hope to return to it's moral strength before the Punic Wars. The influx of wealth after conquering Carthage had corrupted the Roman elite, made them fat and weak, and Caesar had hoped to rectify this.

Of course, the primary language of Imperial Romans was latin, but I've read that the educated were also taught greek.  At some point, before Justinian at least, the Eastern Empire adopted greek as its primary language.  When did this happen, and was it by decree?  Was greek naturally more widespread in the east than latin?  I suppose that Helenism had, at some point, established greek as the Lingua Franca during the early Republic, but I'd always presumed that, during the Empire, Latin had overtaken it.  Perhaps not, in the more established cultures of the East?

What I am trying to prove is two fold. First, that the strength and unity of the empire was in the Imperial system, which formed a sort of blanket structure within which each unique cultural grouping operated. I envision it as some sort of cultural/political 'glue', holding the massive territories of the empire together and under control (more or less). I was inspired in this aspect by the writings of Greg Woolf, but I feel the need to consult more sources than just him, but cannot find any other good ones. The second aspect of my thesis is that this Imperial 'glue' dissolved during the third century crisis. I am endeavoring to explain how the military anarchy, economic collapse, and political instability each undermined a crucial pillar of the Imperial system, resulting in a disillusioned populace no longer enthralled by the Imperial system. Part of this is also how the system was essentially eviscerated, and how by the rise of Diocletian there was no hope of recovering the previous Imperial dominance.

1. how accurate is Gibbon's report, according to more modern evaluations and findings ? 
2. According to Gibbon, the praetorian guard appears to be a raging mob controlling power through violence, intimidation and control of the selection for the emperor. In fact, it appears that the roman empire was mostly administered through these methods with an impressive frequency. What is the reason behind this complete loss of control and authority over the guard ?
3. When the Roman empire was at its maximum expansion, one comment from Gibbon states that in Rome, there were basically no romans. It was mostly immigrants from various regions, slaves, and free men. I fail to understand how much ""inbred"" and multicultural was the roman society from its inception to its fall, at the citizen level, peasant level, and administrator level.
4. I am currently reading Alexander Severus (222 CE). Apparently, nothing is said until now by Gibbon about christianity during these 200 years. On the other hand, his predecessor was big on the ""sun god"" of Syria, and it was apparent that Roman society was way more religious than I expected, with Christianity being just one that happened to gain political traction and complete spread. How religious was Roman society?
5. Women are clearly empowered, but not at the political level. No mention is made about a politically relevant female, unless for occasional care. How much official political influence had women at the time (between 0-200 CE), and through which channels?

That would mean that Roman combat capability was decreased as they had to guard them as they traveled in both cases.

How were they fed? It's hard enough to feed an army in enemy territory. Now you have to feed soldiers and slaves.

A look at the list of Roman consuls in their history shows that around the 350s, Flavius suddenly became a popular name for everyone. From the 400s onwards, it seems that no prominent Roman person had any other name.

It seems to be different from the practice around 150-250 AD of the emperors taking the name of the previous two guys in the job since every body became Flavius.

Apart from the fact that Constantine had that as his praenomen, I see no reason why the name should become so popular.

It was overwhelming, seeing the Temple of Jupiter with Vesuvius in the backdrop. All the houses, the stepping stones, and the structure of the entire city. Rick Steves informed me about the baths, the fountains, the pipes, even the brothels and the rest of everyday life in the city.

The barbarian is unbearded, which is unlike normal barbaric images. The closest things I have found in style are the Arch of Septimus Severus (A provincial Severan work) and certain parts of the Arch of Constantine in Rome. This dates it anywhere from the early 3rd century (~203) to the early 4th century (315). Does anyone have any idea how I could narrow down the date range and try to pin down a location? The style seems so unique I almost want to say it's a fake (but that would be upsetting and easy, so, as such, I'm asking for others' opinions)! Album of images is attached.

Working on a GIS mapping project about Iron Age Roman Coins in Wales.

Since only Roman citizens could join in the actual legions while peregrini joined as Auxilia, that meant the majority of the recruits/replacement to the legions had to be citizens. Conclusion was that they had to have come from Italy.

From http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html#14.9 .  The passage is about the reforms of the Roman calendar from Numan to Julian.  

I translated everything after ""et Ianuario"" to 

""and indeed to January he give the days which we call the fourth and third Kalends of February, to April the sixth kalends of May, to June the third Kalends of July, to August the fourth and third Kalends of September, to September the third kalends of october, to November the third Kalends of December, to December, in truth, the fourth and third Kalends of January.""

I do not understand what is meant by giving (what they now call) the third Kalends of July (which is June 29?) to June?  Were they inserting *specific* days into specific slots in the month?  I'm honestly really confused.  What is he trying to say here? What specific days were moved, where?  Thank you.

What jealous ruler doesn't want as much insider dirt as possible on his potential rivals?  Naturally the ancient world was full of palace hallways riddled with concealed spy-holes and spies to peek through them, but what exactly did spies do in those days, and do we know anything about the formal structure of Roman intelligence gathering efforts?

I suppose the inherently secretive and clandestine nature of an intelligence agency is such that perhaps above all other organizations, it would be the hardest to find hard evidence for, especially if you are looking for that evidence thousands of years after the organization has ceased to exist.

It would be pretty cool if the Emperor had some secret order of assassins or spies, sort of like a cloak-and-dagger alternative to the Legions... not unlike America's use of both the CIA and the military, sometimes separately, sometimes together, depending on the situation."	t5_2s8l1	True

Before making the decision to assist the brigands, Polybius says that there was a lot of debate that took place. It was likely that forming an alliance with the Mamertines would lead to a war with Carthage, who favored the City of Syracuse. The Romans did not really want to help the guys who had essentially stolen a city but they really didn't want to see Carthage's power expand into Sicily. There was also the problem of Carthage's navy. 

The discussion question was  ""Do you think that not going to war with Carthage was ever an option? Would Rome have been content with staying in Italy if the war with Carthage had not been so prosperous for the soldiers who fought in it?  And finally, Some historians believe that the victory over Carthage and the decision to go to war in the first place was the beginning of the end for the Republic. What do you think

Holzmann	4	1	4	"Forgive me if this post doesn't *quite* fit into the subreddit description on the left, but I think this is the place most likely to have good answers and insights into what I'm wondering.

I finished reading Felix Dahn's *Ein Kampf um Rom* a while ago, a book which deals with the rise and fall of the Ostrogoths in Italy. A constant theme throughout the book is that 5th century Romans weren't ""true Romans"" in the sense of the turn-of-the-millenium Romans. In other words, they weren't hard like the Romans of Caesar's Rome, but more or less ""docile"" in nature, content to be ruled by whomever, as long as the boat doesn't rock too much. To cut a long story short, the Ostrogoths are finally expelled from Italy by Byzantium, but by an army composed almost entirely of non-Romans (i.e., Germanic tribes, Huns, etc.) 

The reason I'm posting this here is because I get the feeling this was a trend that didn't suddenly pop up out of nowhere, so it probably began sometime before the fall of the Western Empire. But when? and why? Was Rome able to field ""Roman"" armies towards the end, or did they really rely heavily on mercenaries? If so, why did the Roman military appartus slowly shift from Romans to non-Romans? And did Roman citizens truly become ""more docile"" or was there more to it than that?"	t5_2s8l1	True

1339142681.0	urakq	Hi /r/Ancientrome! I need some help writing an introduction for my Ancient Rome essay, would any of you lovely historians care to help? :) (Not sure if this is the right place to post...)	elddiR	10	9	8	"The essay focuses on Nero and his reign, and how although Lord Acton's assertion, ""Power tends to corrupt but absolute power corrupts absolutely"", is indicative of Nero's reign it fails to represent Nero's reign from the beginning, (which according to Suetonius and Tacitus was 'designed according to an Augustinian Government'. And he had a few prosperous years. Anyway, this is what I have so far:

No era of Roman history is as complexly misinterpreted as during the fifteen years when Nero ruled from the Imperial palace. And, when Nero's reign ended, no upheaval was greater than the one to follow. In the history of the world, one man's villainy would eclipse the prosperity of his reign, and Nero's end would bring about a legend more enduring than such an ineffectual leader was ever worth. Yet, the reaction to Nero’s suicide in 68 AD from the Roman world reflected a much different person from the megalomaniac monster commonly depicted in the darker passages of Suetonius, Tacitus, and Dio.  Lord Acton , a contemporary moralist and historian remarked that “power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.”  Although Acton defines Nero’s legacy, it fails to truly resemble his reign from his inaugural address, a rule that was a result of his rise to power, his manipulative methods, the influences on his power, and the various programs instituted under his reign that inevitably ended the line of conquering Caesars and began the road to Rome's fall as a world power. 

And I would like to convey the thesis that he started out as a good ruler, but inevitably wound up corrupted through his abuse of power. If anyone would like to help I can provide further information on my paragraphic topics etc. Everything else is written, I just suck at writing introductions. :( 

Edit: The essay is for my Year 12 finals... any help is much appreciated!! 

Thank you in advance!! "	t5_2s8l1	True

Pictures, stories, facts, links, anything that relates to history is welcome. This is not only Roman history, this is history of the world!

Also, this is 100% optional you can rename yourself, on steam, to the name of a Western, or Eastern, Roman Emperor like some members have. But of course if you do not want to it is no big deal at all.

So if are looking for a group to play games in, and want to talk about history and what not join us on steam!
