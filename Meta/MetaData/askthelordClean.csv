I took some time and edited them all together into coherent threads and lists. (Note: This doesn't include all the banned comment caps, or PM's. Those are pretty straightforward as they are.)

You can see all the threads in the order they were ranked when he screencapped them. I've also marked which threads have been leaked. There are a few interesting ones I would have loved to have seen.

## ---------------------------------------------------
And here are individual links to all the leaked threads. Note that not every thread was leaked in its entirety. I also had to guess at a couple of them, so it's possible one or two might have comments mixed in from a different thread. (I think I got it all correct.)

I get that Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit and all so we are on a bit of a out of control roller coaster with many things, but what else have Adam and Eves long decedents been munching since that time, do they have glaucoma and need marijuana or something so their thought process is a bit skewed allowing their offspring to think that this type of behavior is ok. Is there something you can give to their offspring to make them stop? Possibly a sedative, or some form of miraculous birth control so the people that have this nature are not allowed to reproduce and add to the general population. There are simply too many of your dogs that are having to leave this earth in the worst ways imaginable and nothing seems to be done by the government that rains over us in the form of punishment. Some days I avoid Facebook and my e-mail just so I don't have to see the hundreds of dogs that need out of a shelter or bad situation in a few hours before they die. Nothing can scar your heart more than seeing a dog being gassed to death in a chamber because of overpopulation or the execution of a dog on a rope hanging from a tree or a dog on fb being suffocated at a Taco Bell drive through because the owner thought it would be a cool pic (true story) because some people just think its cool.	t5_2xkmc	True

And when they bring it up, ""Are you ready for that thing?"" you stare at them - squinty eyed - (talking in your own head, asking yourself if you have any recollection of this ""thing"" you're supposed to go do).

You tell them you don't have a clue as to what they're talking about, and they get upset, but the true reality is that you haven't had time to think about it, but according to them you swore you'd go. 

Anyway, you end up going just to end the nagging, that and so you don't seem like a jerk..

My question is; should, by some huge statistical anomaly, I actually be accepted into Heaven, does Heaven have a relocation program? Most of my friends, and heroes are probably in Hell, and I would very much like the chance to meet them.
