Not to be deterred, I discovered HoverZoom is open source under the MIT license, so I've forked it, published it to github here: https://github.com/ralph-tice/hoverfree , named it HoverFree based on /u/acm suggestion, and published it to the Chrome web store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hover-free/hcmnnggnaofmhflgomfjfbndngdoogkj

All I am out is an evening of my time and the small $5 fee it took for me to create a developer account on the Chrome Web Store and now all of Reddit (and the rest of the Internet...) can enjoy HoverFree again!

If anyone would like to submit an icon for HoverFree I'll upload the highest upvoted icon that results from this thread after a couple days, if it's not a joke icon.

Update 3/6: Just pushed v1.0.1.  Just keeping up with Hover Zoom fixes and plugin additions (with full code review of course) and some dead code cleanup (last of the trackEvents code is gone now) and added HoverFree social media stuff and 100%'d the rename to Hover Free..."	t5_2qlz9	True

Also, I know that you can disable the CSS with RES, but I don't really use RES, and I quite like the style besides the lack of a downvote button, so I really don't want to be switching back and forth to vote on things.

1302790030.0	gpwqc	Caution: Auto HD for YouTube extension is now injecting ads into facebook!	nathanuk	159	47	29	"The latest update for Auto HD for YouTube extension is now injecting ads into facebook pages.

The developer added a extra permission to access facebook.com, and used a disguise of a share button to justify the permission.

However, if you take a look at share.js you can see it is injecting ads into facebook. You will need to unpack the JavaScript file using something like http://jsbeautifier.org/.
  
  **UPDATE**
Developer has just updated the extension to remove facebook permission and remove the injection code.
  2.2.1.193 now looks safe, although I would personally not trust this developer anymore.

  If you are interested here is the injection code from the previous update: http://pastebin.com/RvMFkQw6

  
  **UPDATE 2**
  Uninstall it now! Developer has updated extension again and changed the application to ""AutoShare for Facebook &amp; Youtube"". This extension is now a completely different, does Google even allow this? The ad injection code is back!
  
  Seems like he created a good extension, waited for it to get popular, then turn it into malware.
  
  ** UPDATE 3 **
  Checkout the terms for the extension: http://www.fb-smart.com/terms.html  (Google translated, it's in French)
&gt; AutoShare for Facebook &amp; Youtube is free, AutoShare for Facebook &amp; Youtube gives itself the right to place at any time without advertising that is intrusive advertising.

  --
&gt; Personally identifiable information (such as your username) are collected during the use of AutoShare for Facebook &amp; YouTube and are used for operation
  
**UPDATE 4**
 Looks like it has been removed from the web store! Just hope Google can remote remove it from people who have already updated to the new version.

**UPDATE 5**
 Looks like its back, It's still injecting adverts via code.js. Looks like Google doesn't really care.

proof? - http://chews-really-screwed-the-pooch.smoothgesturesapp.com/

I posted a reply on the other thread, but rather than threadjack I wanted to take the chance to hear from you all and explain what is going on.

I'm not trying to spy on users but instead were using this code to populate a map of users. We're using the very cool node.js app called hummingbird. - https://github.com/mnutt/hummingbird

We should have done this differently and for that **I AM DEEPLY SORRY**. Even before google removed us, we voluntarily disabled the web application and it remains down. Over 90 thousand users upgraded to this code and rather than run the risk of further alienating (and not the cool reddit kind of aliens) we took what steps we could to rectify this.

While we could have easily gotten the referrer data from the call we opted to just get the domain. Why? We are using that data to run regression code for the cases where smoothgestures runs poorly.

We're not trying to be dicks here, we just didn't think ahead and in that blatently obvious oversight cost us to have a rollercoaster of a day.

I also have another plugin called Troll Emoticons that had the same code for about 3 weeks now so we didnt really think it was a problem.
I am going this AMA about the subject, what our day has been like, and talk to you fellow redditors about how to get what we were looking for. Accurate user statistics, something that the chrome webstore lacks. 

An updated build going back to the way things worked has been submitted to google and it is awaiting their review.

While we're waiting to get the update back in the store and would love to get your feedback.

    Changelog and feature set for the next update
    * 1.7% more awesome
    * 97.3% Less ""spy-ee""

1345902899.0	yt080	Turned a 6 year old Thinkpad into a Chromebook.  What an awesome way to recycle an old device.  	Bartman4444	116	21	20	"The last company I worked for supplied everyone with a Thinkpad and every 3 years we would get a new one and since the old ones were completely depreciated they never wanted the old ones back.  The other day I was cleaning out a storage closet and came across my old IBM (yes, pre Lenovo sale) T60 Thinkpad that had Windows XP Enterprise Edition installed.  I fired it up and while the battery won't hold a charge it was a functional, if not extremely slow, device.  Since it was an Enterprise Edition I did not have Admin level and could not do much to clean it up (for example, defrag would only run while connected to the network, which I cannot connect to since I don't work for that company anymore).  Did a little online research and discovered I could download Chromium onto a thumb drive and boot really any PC from a USB port with this simple OS.    

I'm certainly no master technician but following the directions from Lifehacker.com I had that old laptop up and running as a Chromebook in no time at all.  My ten year old daughter is now the proud owner of her Dad built Chromebook.  "	t5_2qlz9	True

There are plenty of file-sharing sites out there. There are no good ones (that we could find) that focus on ensuring your file can't be stolen over the air or stumbled upon with the link or snooped on by a site admin. Our service AES-encrypts your file in the browser before anything is transferred. The site supports full resuming of both downloads and uploads, which was a treat to implement given the constraints of anonymity and fully encrypted transfers.

Think about if you were applying for a loan and had to transfer your 40 page, 70mb tax return to a mortgage broker. How could you do this easily and securely? We aim to meet that need. 

The site is https://cryptoshed.com/. It's currently a closed beta, and we'd love to hear what you tech enthusiasts think. The password to the beta is **reddit**. Do you like the idea? Do you see any value to it? Are there any dealbreakers or things you'd like to see changed? What do you think?

**Update 3**: Still no word of a proper fix yet. If anyone has heard of any fix please do comment. Also I still seem to be experiencing some crashes even with HTML5 trial on. However someone else mentioned if you drag the youtube tab out before closing it to make a new window it prevents chrome from crashing somehow.

My extension is called [Better History](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/obciceimmggglbmelaidpjlmodcebijb). I've tackled a few important milestones that take Better History miles above the other history options. Core features...

* Organizing history into digestible time intervals
* Grouping visits from the same domain
* Enhancing day filters
* Using Preferences UI 
* Deleting beyond removing single visits
* Evolving the time interval interface 
* Making search actually work

(Personally, I think the last point is the most important. Searching your history in Chrome is completely broken if you ask me. [I put lots of energy into fixing that](http://automagical.posterous.com/making-chromes-history-searching-better))

I understand that it is a worthy effort to save wasted bandwidth, but theimplementation is abominable. For more than six months, I have been forced to copy and paste YouTube links into a different browser to watch because they simply do not work in Chrome; googling the problem, it seems to be very common.

How could an organization of Google's size, wealth, and intelligence commit such a glaring gaffe, and let it stand for so long?

The problems started as just small nuances, but are now getting to the point where I can't even use Chrome for its core purpose. You spend any time on their support forums and find it riddled with issues. The biggest seem to stem from flash, but so many are core issues.

I realize I have no idea how Google allocates its development time, but I feel like they need to shift their efforts, focusing more on just ensuring their browser actually performs its core function, viewing web content!

The problem is, all that time spent on features is what's made it such an amazing browser. So for me, trying to switch browsers has become almost as much hassle. For the most part I still use Chrome as my primary browser, but I'm finding I need to use FF and even IE more and more to compensate.

Am I alone in this, or do others feel the same?


**[Edit 1]** Most people are asking about the issues I have, so here's the gist of it.

Flash has always been the most prominent, but that alone is too much IMO. I've disabled the pepflashplayer which fixes 90% of the issues, but anything that requires flash I'm forced to use FF. It might not sound like such a big deal, but I use YouTube quite frequently (viewing and managing my videos), so having to switch to FF constantly is very frustrating and time consuming. Which btw...how does Google produce a browser that can't play it's own videos?

Constant issues with pinned tabs not loading on startup. 

* Pinned tabs need to be static and difficult to remove. You should not be able to change the site that's 'pinned' without closing the tab. 
* Links click from Pinned tabs should override your preferences and open in a new tab. 
* If you have a window with pinned tabs, open a 2nd window, then close your tabbed window first...POOF! You lose your pinned tabs next time you open Chrome.

I still get, what I'll call 'tab ghosting' quite frequently. It's when you click on another tab but the previous tab's content is still displayed, so you have to refresh the page. Try writing out a half-page reply in a forum only to rewrite it half a dozen times.

Most recently after the update yesterday, it basically shut down all ability to use it. I did find a workaround by disabling GPU and threaded compositing. However, it doesn't work on all pages and I get constant ghosting.

I just noticed the Live Preview from the enhanced reddit suite extension is not updating (i.e. not live).

Other than that, I mean there's been issues for me with almost every significant update. Fixes range from disabling this plugin or that extension or waiting until the next update. At least twice I've had to quit using Chrome for at least 2-3 weeks until there was a fix. The odd part is I have 4 computers at home and my one at work. Chrome works perfectly on three of them (my 2 HTPCs and spare laptop) but my primary desktop and work PC both have constant issues, which are the two use almost exclusively :(

**[EDIT 2]** Thanks for all the feedback everyone! (I'm actually surprised at how few people here have issues considering the all the crap I've dealt with in the last year or more.)

I'd also like to thank everyone for your support help. To clarify, here are several of the steps I've tried in the past along with some other basic info. I'll gladly accept any suggestions and try about anything though! I haven't reinstalled Chrome yet since yesterday's issues began though, so I'll do that now.

* OS: All desktop PCs running Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit, Laptop running Windows 7 Ultimate 32-bit
* Extensions: Checker Plus for Gmail, Google Voice, Group Reddit Saved Links, IBA Opt-out, LastPass, Reddit Enhancement Suite and Xmarks.
* Have done a clean uninstall/reinstall multiple times over the years with no luck. I first erased all my browser saved data, I always use Revo for uninstalling and deleted all profile folders.
* The issues have even came about after a clean install of Windows; however, I know the last time I reinstalled windows on my home desktop, I did not have issues for at least the first few days, if not a week or two even with all extensions being used. My guess is it began acting up again after an update."	t5_2qlz9	True

First let me lay some groundwork:

* I live in the SF bay area, so there's pretty much Wi-Fi everywhere I go

* I'm a cs major and so I do a **LOT** on my computer

* I didn't buy it as a PC replacement

______________________________________________________________________________________________
**SAMSUNG CHROMEBOOK PROS/CONS**

Now that I have that out of the way let me tell you about the bad stuff first. 

**CONS**

* Chicklet style keys are not backlit

* the apple copycat touchpad only has buttons on the bottom

* there is no caps lock button, but a search button that I repeatedly hit when thinking that it's a caps lock.

* power button is right above backspace, however all this does if you click it is start to minimize the window. Not terrible, but annoying.

* the speakers suck total ass

* no function buttons. Again, not the end of the world, but it's annoying

* 16 gb ssd (not a problem for me because I picked up a 1.5 TB external for $80)

* limited apps 


**PROS**

* light as fuck

* screen is actually pretty bright

* Quickest boot I've ever had

* battery charges quickly and lasts a good amount of time

* I'm personally a google fan and have a nexus tablet and galaxy nexus phone, so syncing all of my stuff is incredibly easy

* although they're not backlit the keys feel pretty sturdy when pressed and aren't worthless clicky things like some that I've had.

* 4g network compatible (I havent bought the data plan for it yet, but I plan to)

* did I mention it was light?

* less than 5 minute setup if you already have a google account.

* *google drive is a great portable office suite, though lacking in some bells and whistles it serves me perfectly fine and an import/export .doc and .docx files.

* *the remote desktop app is a great, easy way to screenshare and is great for tech support

* *great Wi-Fi range. I can sit outside of the CompSci building on a nice day and still have full connectivity. (also partly the fact that we have pretty good wireless routers at my school)


________________________________________________
**CHROME-OS PROS/CONS**

Although the newest addition to the list of operating systems I feel that Google did an amazing job at getting something that was fast, pretty, and functional all at the same time; and I can't wait to see what future generations of this OS bring

**CONS**

* Always working in a browser feels pretty confining even though it really isn't

* not much to customize *(this can be seen as a Pro as well)* 

* it's a web based OS, so offline mode doesn't offer very much

* will **NOT** replace your mac/pc for any type of graphics editing. Not only are most of the models incapable of running such ram/cpu intensive programs; but you're stuck with web based knock-offs of programs like photoshop

* **EDIT* I've found a pretty good photoshop replacement. It's a ""full featured"" photo editing app, but lacks some of the finer tuning abilities of photoshop and other little things. But it makes a great web-alternative. [HERE'S](http://pixlr.com/editor) the link to the app, called Pixlr editor. 


**PROS**

* again the fastest booting OS I've ever had

* this one's more personal prefenrence; but I love the rudimentary styling of the Files app. It makes it hard to get lost in a plethora of folders and it helps me stay focused on the task at hand instead of dicking around with settings and formatting and stuff like that.

* most apps aren't at all CPU intensive so multiple windows hasn't been a problem for me (after adding 2gb virtual RAM from the SSD)

____________________________________________________________________________________________
I'll keep this thread updated as I find more pros/cons (will be notated with an extra asterisk. and I'll submit a conclusion when I've spent more time using it. And Please feel free to add any pros or cons to the comments so I can put them up here.

^I'm ^using ^my ^chromebook ^right ^now ^to ^write ^this



*I also plan to add another thread just for all the tips and tricks to use, including caps lock and function buttons.*

special thanks to spif and DoctorBurger for helping me out with those.

Chrome, however, often seems to be waiting a very long time before restoring the position, especially on reddit, forcing the user to scroll down manually.

This is annoying enough that I often open links in background tabs, even though I shouldn't have to, just to avoid having to scroll down over and over again.

The expected behavior would be to immediately restore the last known position when returning to a page via the back button, just like other browsers do.

Anyone know if there is a workaround for this or any open issues on the chromium bug tracker? I tried searching but couldn't find anything.

Inspired by a previous post, I set out to create a new extension to fulfill the following needs:

- At work I don't plan on commenting. I need a ""miniamlist"" approach to Reddit
- It has to look as much like code as possible

Thus I created this Chrome extension, to practice my javascript and as well to share it with the place that gave me the idea in the first place.

You can download it here
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4354439/OverloadBrowser.crx
Source:
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4354439/overload.zip

It's still a work in progress but for now it has been working great. 
HOW TO USE:

Once installed you should see an O icon on the top-right of Google Chrome. It should be Grayed out until you click it. It should turn blue when you click it. It is now enabled. Browse to Reddit, done! To disable just click it again. 

(It actually works on all websites, so you can browse more than just Reddit but it was optimized for Reddit).

Then you can just type ""r chrome"" into the address bar for instance to go straight to that subreddit.

But it's been about two years since then. Now it has extensions, developer tools, and tons of really nice useable features. And to top it all off, it's got that nice Google sheen. The way it both looks nice and is really easy to use. The way Google takes every little feature into consideration, and how the user will interact with it.

I was getting so sick of Firefox freezing and lagging and hanging and crashing. I really loved Firefox, but it's just not what it used to be anymore. Chrome's extensions are what really sold me.

There have been a bunch of changes that I see so far:

* Notifications Icon in Windows Notification Area, look like it replaces the bubbles that would come up on the right hand side.

* The new tab page has changed. It now shows a Google search box in the middle and 4 of your most visited websites under it instead of 8. Broken because you cant middle click these to open them in a new tab. If you have a theme instead, it kinda acts like the new Google search wallpaper, that they removed a couple of months ago. 

* When typing in the omnibar, the interface has changed, and maybe broken, but the 'Google black bar' that ran across the top doesn't show, making it harder to access Google services like mail and calender.

* The new tab page has a apps button but looks like it doesn't work yet either. 

* Looks like they are relocating the recent tabs that was in the new tab page to your 'menu button' the three bar button that they use in Android.

I'm sure there's more. Keep updated.

1320683975.0	m3mx5	Why I don't like the new Chrome webstore | What about you?	xpressyoo	45	7	5	"At the end of October, Google launched a new Chrome webstore for extensions and applications developed for its browser. The idea was to provide a ""new look"" that would help to ""quickly scan the store and find interesting things to try out"" [1].

Although the new look is indeed more ""catchy"", there are (in my opinion) important issues that should be fixed or at least highlighted.


= 1) Search | I don't know if you tried recently to search for something in the new webstore, but results tend to be very irrelevant.

For instance, let's search for ""Gmail"" [2]. Results will display apps and extensions all together and more importantly results that do have nothing to do with the original query, e.g ""Angry Birds"", ""Plants vs Zombies"", ""Turn Off the Lights"". Clearly, the algorithm puts largely too much weight on the popularity or the number of users of an extension/app.

Now, let's be more precise, and let's search for ""ad remover gmail"" [3] - short story, I developed an extension for Gmail called ""Ad Remover and Better UI for Gmail"". Here, again the first result is irrelevant ""MusicSig vkontakte""!! Why the latter extension appears in first position: (i) popular (&gt;100'000 users) (ii)the words ""removing ads"" appear in its description. So, the new webstore algorithm seems to parse and take into account more than before the description of addons and extensions. Again, the weight of the parameter ""description"" should be far less than the one put on the ""name"" of the extension/app to avoid this kind of issues.


= 2) Navigation | The new first page uses tiles to present extensions/apps to the user. Basic information available at first glance are the name of the app/extension and number of stars. While it's good to attach the [1-5] stars-scale to indicate the ""quality"" of an extension/app, this measure seems a bit incomplete without indicating the number of users the extension/app has.


= 3) Screenshots | When you publish an extension in the new webstore, you must provide screenshots with a size of 1280x800 px. This size is pretty big and not very understandable, especially when you see that those screenshots are resized to half, ie 640x400px [4]. Why don't include a kind of lightbox functionality making possible for the user to click on a screenshot to enlarge it?

What do you think of the new webstore? Do you have any insights on the new search algorithm they put in place?

What this extension does is puts an [icon next to your omnibox](http://i.imgur.com/VKAQ9.png). Clicking on it will open a [lame image-placeholder](http://i.imgur.com/7TZSt.png). Clicking on the image will [launch your Google Play/Music in a new window](http://i.imgur.com/NPebb.png) (address bar and all that good stuff is hidden in the popup.

It's called ""[Plus One Anything](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ebhbdmijnijoeoanepompkkdpclndleo)"". It adds an icon in your chrome window and when you press it, it reveals the +1 button specific for the page you are on.   

The only limitations for using this is that you have to be logged into your Google account and you cannot +1 any page that requires authentication. 

I would really appreciate if you guys tried it out and left some honest feedback. If you have any questions I will do my best to answer :)

* SSH
* opening/creating .rar/.zip files

* I assume it has ~3-4 usb ports, but I tend to use a lot of them. Would it be compatible with a usb hub? I'm almost positive that the one I have doesn't require any drivers, so I don't see why it wouldn't work, but just making sure.

Hey everyone! Thank you for participating in the r/chrome subreddit survey of the week! We got over +70 responses, which isn't bad at all, and a wide variety of answers for some key questions, which is pretty cool.

A majority of you are males aged 17-25. Very few of you own or have ever owned a chromebook. Only one of you hasn't recommend chrome to anyone else. Speed was an important issue for many of you in choosing Chrome as your browser. Also, on average, it looks like people have installed more extensions than apps.

Please join us over on [r/SampleSize](http://www.reddit.com/r/samplesize) for more fun surveys to participate in, or create one of your own.

Thanks again to everyone who had a spare moment to participate! Please update this self-post (with which I don't receive any karma) for high visibility for everyone.

1. Some userscript incompatibility (seems that certain code blocks do not work with chrome, although I have not tested this in recent months)
2. Noscript alternatives for Chrome are not well developed (for example, if you use icefilms, every video you try and play you will  have to unblock the first part of the domain seperately for every video as it changes, from s164.mega..., m143.mega..., etc.). The menus for unblocking stuff using notscripts or scriptno are just annoying as well, simplicity when dealing with pages that have over 10 blocked domains is far more appreciated in my book.
3. Sluggish performance with a lot of tabs open
4. Pages actually load significantly slower if there are a lot of images, use icefilms.info for example. 
5. No real tweaking eligibility, I miss my about:config

Now, there are several things that I love about Chrome as well, just so this isn't taken as a chrome bashing thread.

1. Very lightweight and fast startup
2. I love Chrome's debugging tool over firebug, it is much more resource friendly as well.
3. The incredibly swift development cycle
4. Incognito mode, much more adept than start private browsing, plus you can have a non incognito window open at the same time, huge ups in my book."	t5_2qlz9	True

I am at a loss here. I recently started experiencing extremely long buffer times on google chrome. It's my main browser and I just figured my internet was acting up. I was attempting to stream 1080P and after that wouldn't work I switched down to 720 and then eventually 320. 

I have a decent internet connection around 38 megabits/s and it was really weird to see this problem come out of nowhere. I downloaded firefox and the video streamed with absolutely no buffer time at all.

Ive tried opting into the html 5 beta, deleting cookies, scanning for viruses and still no results. The only extension I have installed currently installed is ADblock, RES, and Hover Zoom.

1271356926.0	brfes	Incognito Window - Not just for porn		36	6	9	"OK, full disclosure.  It's *mostly* for porn.  But here's a list of some other uses for Chrome's Incognito Window.  Feel free to add more if you like.


* The [Acid3](http://acid3.acidtests.org/) test hangs at 98/100 for me in a normal window (Mac OSX, Chrome 5.0.342.9 beta, with several extensions, YMMV).  Running this test in an Incognito Window will make it to 100/100 with one error—""You should not see this at all"" is rendered in the top left corner.  If you are experiencing problems viewing a website, try it in an Incognito Window to resolve some of these issues.

* Extensions are disabled in a convenient way.  Rather than adding a site to your adblock white-list, turning off flashblock, or disabling any other extension that seems to be breaking a site, open it in an Incognito Window.  This is particularly helpful if the site in question is one that you don't go to very often and a permanent fix is unnecessary.

* Quickly log in to secondary accounts.  If you're like me and have no-spam accounts for email, trolling/novelty accounts for your favorite social news sites (not reddit, of course), you can use the Incognito Window to access these accounts without logging out of your main account.

Some or all of these may be quite obvious to some of you, but since they are so helpful I figured I'd share.  What do you use the Incognito Window for (aside from porn)?"	t5_2qlz9	True

Experimental WebKit Features It's controlled by a switch called switches::kEnableExperimentalWebKitFeatures . And there are currently two files that make use of the switch: content/renderer/render_thread_impl.cc and content/browser/web_contents/web_contents_impl.cc

http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/content/renderer/render_thread_impl.cc
http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/content/browser/web_contents/web_contents_impl.cc

Do a find in page with ""kEnableExperimentalWebKitFeatures"" and voila. Here are the features that are currently in experimental stage and can be tested with the runtime flag on:

* Scoped Stylesheets
* Custom DOM Elements
* Experimental Content Security Policy
* HTML &lt;dialog&gt; Element
* HTML &lt;iframe seamless&gt; Attribute
* CSS Regions
* CSS Exclusions
* CSS Grid Layout
* CSS Sticky Positioning (position: -webkit-sticky)
* CSS Variables

Experimental JavaScript Features can be enabled by launching Chrome with the --harmony command-line flag.

Chrome uses V8, so we need to dig into V8 source... Found!

https://code.google.com/p/v8/source/browse/branches/bleeding_edge/src/flag-definitions.h#133

Looks like currently these are enabled with the --harmony flag:

What should I know?	fauxnetikz	37	7	56	"I've used FF for quite a while now and I've gotten used to it.  I have it set up just the way I like it as well.  Here's a list of the functionality I'd like to continue having after the switch, please let me know if these are do-able:

* Greasemonkey scripts.  I've seen the sidebar links and this seems possible, but is ""Greasemonkey"" what I should be using or is there a better alternative extension?

* AdBlock+.  It seems to be available for Chrome, is the functionality the same?  I have custom filters that prevent any websites other than Facebook from accessing my Facebook cookie, along with a few other filters and whitelists.  I know that I can import/export settings, but are they compatible between the FF and Chrome versions?

* NoScript - does this functionality exist for Chrome?  From a quick google, it seems that it's built in to the browser itself.

The rest of the basics I can figure out.

*Is there anything I should know ahead of time, any tips/tricks/secrets that you wish you knew when you first started using Chrome?*

And perhaps my most important question...The whole reason for this switch...

I have my FireFox set to clear ALL data/cookies upon exit and never remember history.  I don't save passwords.  I leave the browser open for days at the time to avoid the inconvenience of logging back in to everything, but I like being able to just close it and have everything cleared and locked out.  This causes FF's memory usage to steadily rise, and I've found myself having to close/restart it more and more often lately.  **Will Chrome facilitate this unorthodox browser usage and extended sessions, or will I suffer the same memory problems?**

1298484266.0	fr6ld	I seem to get asked this a lot, so here we go:  How to set up address bar keywords and custom search engines in Chrome.	NeededANewName	37	9	7	"Lots of people seem to assume that Chrome doesn't have the ability to use custom address bar keywords to get to sites, but in actuality this feature is already available by default.  Since I figured this out, it's pretty much the exclusive way I browse.  They don't have to be part of the sites name either, they're completely custom.  For example I use 'tpb' to get to thepiratebay.org, and 'so' to get to stackoverflow.com.  The way to implement these is through Chromes custom search feature (which I believe is mislabeled since it's not exclusive to searching).


The custom search feature (go to preferences, then click manage next to where it says Search) allows you to specify address bar keywords, which when followed by a space, will search for the remaining input on that site via a URL you provide.  For example: I've got reddit in there, with the keyword set to 'reddit', and url 'http://www.reddit.com/search?q=%s' . This lets me type ""reddit "" (notice the space) then whatever I want into the address bar, and it will search using reddits own search.  This list is automatically populated as you visit sites, but the keywords are usually the full domain name and never get used.


You can also use this same window to implement non-search keywords. If you dont include a %s in the URL, just typing the keyword and pressing enter will go to the site. For me I've got another 'Search Engine' set up with keyword 're' that points to reddit.com. All I type is 're' and press enter and I'm at reddit.


The only caveat is that you can't have search keywords and regular keywords be the same, so for me I've got 're' to go to reddit, and 'sre' to search reddit.  I've done the same with the rest of my frequented keywords such as 'tpb' and 'stpb', 'so' and 'sso', etc.


I've heard some hate on Chrome for lack of this feature or poor implementation before, and I think it's just because it's not obvious to set up.  I hope this helps clear things up."	t5_2qlz9	True

---so I'm using this to track time I spend working per company,per project, and per task.  It can sync to your dropbox.com account (you don't have one? go check them out) and you can send out daily,weekly, monthly reports to anyone (i.e. Managers/Clients) who needs to know WTF you've been up to.

---We all know how to burn us some time while surfing the interTubes, with this extension in Chrome, you tell it which sites to block and how much time it will allow you to be on these sites each day.  For example, I have facebook.com, reddit.com, gizmodo.com, news.google.com, huffingtonpost.com, and cuteadorablepuppies.com on my block list.  So, the program allows me to be on those sites for a combined total of X minutes per day (you set the X), while I'm on any of those sites the timer starts counting down. It warns me when the timer is close to finishing.  Once the timer has counted down all the way, those pages will be blocked until tomorrow.  When you try any of the pages it says, ""Shouldn't you be working!""  You of course could cheat by using a different browser, but why cheat, you're getting shiz done my friend!

So is there a way to add the scrolling feature of tabs firefox has to chrome? Can one make perhaps two rows, or more, of tabs, allowing better management? Sadly the vertical tabs feature was removed from chrome, is there an extension that can replace this? Basically making the VerticalTabs extension permanently open.

I have a basic functional version ready to go, but don't want to release any names, screenshots or specs to the general public yet (as they may change as a result of testing).

If you're interested, please let me know which OS you intend to test under (need some *nix testers especially). Also, let me know if you use the Sign Into Chrome functionality of the browser (I need people that do and people that don't). You'll need a Google account with a valid @gmail.com email address to participate.

I'll be looking at the info you provide and how often you post comments and links on Reddit to make my decision (don't want pure karma whores and don't want wallflowers). If you're chosen, I will be PMing you to ask for the Google account you want to have added to the testers list. I'll put you in the credits for the plugin as a way of thanks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
**DO THIS FIRST!!!***

**Always Allow Extensions From Outside the Chrome Web Store**


If you frequently install extensions from outside the Web Store, you can allow extension installation from any website by adding a command-line flag.

To add a command-line option, you’ll have to edit the Chrome shortcut’s properties. To access these on Windows 7, assuming you launch Chrome from your taskbar, right-click the Chrome icon on your taskbar, right-click Google Chrome in the menu that appears, and select Properties.

If you launch Chrome from your Start menu or your desktop, right-click the shortcut on your Start menu or desktop instead.

**Select the Shortcut tab and add the following text to the end of the Target box:**

**–enable-easy-off-store-extension-install**

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Next: Drag and drop the CRX (or user.js) file onto the Extensions page to install it. 

You’ll be prompted to confirm installation of the extension, just as if you had installed it from the Chrome Web Store.

An extension that splits the active window into 2 browsers and modifies the links on the left (via js?) to always open in the right pane, replacing its current content.  Basically, this would be useful in all the situations where I'd typically do a search or reach a list of some sort, and want to open each result, but not necessarily deal opening a new tab each time, then closing it and swapping back. Another acceptable behavior would be two separate windows where window ""2"" would intercept all new tabs and open them there in the active page instead of actually creating the new tab.

1339194476.0	usaqx	Why I prefer Chrome over Firefox [x-post from r/firefox]		34	11	11	"I was a loyal Firefox user until Chrome came along. And even when it first came out, I stuck with Firefox. But eventually I gave it a shot, and it became my go to browser. Today, there are two reasons that I use Chrome over Firefox, and speed isn't one of them. Though on my hardware, I've noticed that Chrome is generally faster, I'm not such an impatient person that it matters. Also, in my experience is that Firefox drains my laptop's battery a little more. But those are minor differences, differences that don't really matter, especially if I'm on a desktop or am connected to my charger.

The real reasons though, are Google Chrome's Sync feature, and the official Google Voice addon.

I know that Firefox has a Sync feature, but that only syncs your desktop browser with your mobile browser. But that is worthless to me, since I don't have a smart phone. I like the fact that I can fire up a copy of Google Chrome on any computer, on any platform, on any media, and I'll be a short sign-in away from my customized browser with all of my bookmarks and extensions intact. If I'm wrong, and Firefox does have a feature like this that I am unaware of, please let me know and I'll be happy to take this back.

I currently do now own a cell phone, but I do have a Google Voice number. I use that in place of a phone. As long as I have my laptop and a wifi connection, I have a phone. And thanks to the Google Voice addon, I only have to have a dedicated tab open for it if I'm going to make or receive a call. If all I want to do is text, all I have to do is use the little icon on my toolbar. It also notifies me if I have missed calls or voicemails. So if I do miss a call, a little notification pops up and I know I need to open the webapp and check it.

If one day I get a cell phone, I can set it up with Google Voice, and I can dial a number from the addon, and it will ring my cell phone and then make my call for me. It's really quite the useful addon.

I suppose there is probably a work around for the Google Voice extension to get the same kind of functionality, so I guess the Sync is my main reason for using Chrome over Firefox.

Anyway, just felt like discussing and giving my opinion on these two browsers. Lemme know what you think, and feel free to correct any facts that I may have wrong in my post."	t5_2qlz9	True

Do I just need to 'get with the times' and accept that 500MB is the bare minimum? How much do FF &amp; IE use?

I've set mine up so all I have to do is type ""sr chrome"" to jump straight to the Chrome subreddit. If I want to go straight to new, I can just type ""sr chrome/new"" and it'll go to http://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/new. Same if you were to type ""sr chrome/submit"", etc. etc.

So to do it, just right click your address bar and edit your search engines. Add a new one with any name you like (mine's simply called 'subreddit'), under 'keyword' you can have whatever you want, but I choose 'sr', this is what you will be required to type in the omnibar so ideally you want it short so you can really save some time.

Under 'URL', you need to put ; http://www.reddit.com/r/%s in the box. You need the '%s'. Now, it should all be set up to work!

Just a helpful tip I thought you might benefit from if you hadn't worked it out already! You can use the same methodology to do a username search, and even do a Google Search of reddit.com (a great replacement at least until the new reddit search engine gets shipped)."	t5_2qlz9	True

Anyway, I used to use safari so allow me to elaborate. When I'm looking reddit or another site with a bunch of links, sometimes I click on on four or five links with the scroll ball of my mouse (does the same thing as control+click), which opens each link in a new tab, and stays on the tab I'm currently looking at. With safari, I could do that and the tabs wouldn't activate until I opened them. This was nice because that way I didn't have 5 youtube videos playing and loading at once, making a bunch of noise and slowing each other down. 

I like Chrome far better than safari for multiple reasons. This this is one feature that I like better with safari, and as far as I know Chrome doesn't have this customization in its regular settings. So I was hoping there was an extension that made this possible.

* Smarter suggestions (cuts out a lot of the inane, redundant stuff)

Is this Acceptable?	neosiv	26	5	8	"Not sure if this is kosher or not, but I noticed yesterday that my all my Amazon Links had an affiliate tag appended to it, while on the Amazon Site. I'm familiar with Amazon's affiliate marketing tag behavior and I've never seen that happen on their site before. I then noticed that I wasn't seeing this in other browsers. My first suspicion was that is a Chrome extension as the root cause, so I started disabling each extension one by one to see which one was possibly causing it. Sure enough, when I disabled the SocialBa! extension the tag went away (after a page refresh). Here's the link to the extension if you want to try it out yourself (i.e., you don't need to link any accounts):


https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/socialba-publish-sync/lbnldfdnnhniifjjiakifofhdjangplj?hl=en


Here's the tag that gets appended: tag=xunjiacom0e-20 be sure to go on to Amazon's site itself and look a product links.


My question is this sort of thing an OK practice with a Chrome Extension? I haven't read the developer terms of service yet I'll do that next, but I figured this is a good place to start. It seems a bit underhanded practice especially since the extension makes no mention of this.

When using Chrome: I download a torrent file and it downloads just like any other file meaning a) it sits there cluttering my downloads folder, and b) I have to click on it to make utorrent open it (very minor issues I know, but it's something I miss about Firefox)

So, how can I make Chrome do what Firefox does?

Thanks.

**Edit:** In the downloads bar at the bottom there was a dropdown box with the option of 'always open this type of file'. This *almost* does what I want, but not really: The file is still stored in downloads rather than in whatever temporary folder FF stores it in, and it also doesn't open in utorrent normally - instead of giving me an options menu in which I choose what files/folders to download (say for example in a discography), it just starts downloading straight away and I have to manually tell it which files not to download.

**Edit2:** A solution using utorrent's settings rather than Chrome's: In utorrent Options&gt;Preferences&gt;Directories tick the box that says ""automatically load torrents from"", and put your downloads folder in the box, also check the box that says ""delete loaded torrents"". Then go to Options&gt;Preferences&gt;Directories and check the boxes under the ""When adding torrents"" heading saying ""don't start the download automatically"" and ""show a window that displays the files inside the torrent in advanced mode"". This makes it work *almost* identically to how it does with Firefox. The only difference is it won't start utorrent automatically, but if it's already running it works basically the same."	t5_2qlz9	True

It mostly works just great, but if I dare access G+ or Gmail, the browser becomes borderline unresponsive and almost locks up my computer -- forcing me to use a separate browser just for those applications (where they run just fine). 

Relevant specifications:

- Quad-core processor with a clock speed of 2.x GHZ. Machine has 4 GB of RAM. Built-in graphics, too (AMD A6 variety).
- Fedora 16 on top of the latest available kernel.
- Chrome version 18.x.

Chrome is my favorite browser and I would like to keep it as my main browser. Plus, switching between browsers can become troublesome very quickly. Any support on this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

**EDIT:** Fixed! Thanks to RainandWind

&gt; The problem lies with your graphics driver.
If you are using a laptop with 'switchable' graphics then you should set chrome to use Intel through whatever menu you have to do this. This is what fixed the issue for me. I had to right click on the desktop and click 'configure switchable graphics'.

What I did was right click on the desktop, select ""Configure switchable graphics"" and then change chrome.exe from ""High performance"" to ""Power saving"", apply and restart chrome.

1330310484.0	q7j2i	At my wits end with Google Chrome preventing disk sleep.	elendryst	30	10	6	"For awhile now, and as long as I can recall with this version of Chrome (17.0.963.56) and possibly prior, my computer has been unable to go to disk sleep while Chrome was open. I've tried all of the following:

* Disabling browser's built in flash
* Disabling computer's flash and relying on browser's
* Disabling flash altogether
* Disabling phishing/malware, predict network actions, prediction services and web services.
* As I had posted asking for help on Apple Help's reddit a few days ago, someone recommended disabling background apps in Chrome's preferences. I disabled flash on that occasion and it was able to go to disk sleep. It has not gone to disk sleep since. The person to reply recommended I disable background apps running when Chrome was closed, there isn't an option under Chrome's preferences for that.
* Disabling Silverlight.
* I'm not signed into cloud print or sync services.

I have commented on several bugs related to this on the Chromium site.

No errors show up in the Console that could show how Chrome is preventing disk sleep. Furthermore, pmset -g assertions shows nothing as well. It's frustrating for me as I would like to use Chrome over Safari.

For any that could help, I would greatly appreciate it. 

TL;DR: Chrome preventing disk sleep. Disabled everything under the sun and still won't sleep.

[code.js](http://pastebin.com/bYQFSP4v)

It appears as if the code I'm using is looking for a class or an object that is undefined however the ""chrome.tabs.executeScript()"" is injecting the js into the webpage.

Am I approaching this the wrong way? Is there a simpler more effective way to create an extension purely for injecting pre-set javascript into a webpage?

Any ideas will be greatly appreciated.

Previously with instant search enabled, it would search but still let you continue typing your query (IIRC). Now, it prevents you from typing as soon as it performs the instant search.

For example, hit CTRL+L to go to the address bar, start typing ""hello world this is a test"" at a reasonable pace. Chrome will likely autocomplete this as ""hello world"" before you can finish typing the full query, the results page loads and your cursor loses focus from the address bar so you now have to repeat the search.

Whenever I'm searching for things in the omnibar, I immediately hit enter after typing my query. This constantly caused me to search for the wrong thing.

It automatically brings me to my old search for ""NFL players like jail"". This happens to me daily. And it's getting really fucking annoying. The only way I have found to stop this is to hit backspace whenever autocomplete pops up with something I don't want. This is really inconvenient.

I had this extension when it first came out and absolutely loved it. For some odd reason I removed it and regret that since. As of late I have hunted for this extension and cannot find it for the life of me. If anyone has it or has can find me the download link I will be forever indebted to you.

It is very good in that regard, but now im looking for something that will let me obtain a degree of portability that is just not possible with my powerhouse laptop. 

So, I have been looking around at netbooks that would suit my needs. The chromebook was the first machine I looked at, specifically because I am in love with google (chrome, docs, gmail, calendar, etc...). My only concern, and it is a very large one, is that the reviews that I have been reading, granted most of them are from mid-late 2011, report that documents can be saved offline but not edited. I would be getting the wifi version (cant justify the data subscription) and a modest amount of time would be spent editing offline. 

Is this still a problem with the cromebook? I cant imagine that a work around for this hasnt been created, but am I wrong in that regard? Also, any pros/cons that I should really take into consideration before going out and getting one?

I added mine to a queue and she added hers to her own, but once one of us played a song, the other was locked out and would get an error message saying that they were unable to cast the song. Also, the song queue did not show both of our song selections combined. It was only our own personal song queues.

The second issue I found, was that half the time that I clicked the menu for a song and selected ""add to queue,"" all of the songs in that song's playlist are added, rather than just the one song I selected. The other half the time, the song is added by itself. Maybe this is just growing pains for chromecast, but it is weird and does not seem like it should happen that way.
