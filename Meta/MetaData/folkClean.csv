1374105287.0	1iiu9f	I got into a good conversation with Erik Berry, the mandolinist in Trampled By Turtles, and these were his motivating words for me before saying good night. Now excuse me while I go tune up...	YUnoZOOM	64	7	6	"""I do want to emphasize that it's not about hand size or figuring what other mandolinists do--it's about playing music. Ask a guitar playing friend if you can jam. If all you play is G C and D along with the guitarist here's what will happen: your friend will think his/her guitar sounds great with the added notes of the guitar and you'll learn a lot about timing and rhythm and playing with somebody. You can get fancy next year or next winter or next month but you'll be playing music now. And that's the sort of kick in the pants you need because it is slow going at first and when you're by yourself you don't get any reinforcement except maybe your own ""I suck."" And you don't suck; you're just starting out.""

Lord Randall

The Two Sisters

Tom Dooley

Pretty Polly

Omie Wise

Poor Ellen Smith

Down in the Willow Garden

Banks of the Ohio

The Knoxville Girl

In the Pines

Little Sadie

Duncan and Brady

Frankie and Johnny

Stagger Lee

Delia's Gone

This is not an exhaustive list, by any means. I would welcome some input and other suggestions. I'm not adverse to more contemporary murder ballads either (like Hey Joe, or Nebraska) - although traditional songs would be better for my needs. Thanks!

-This land is your land

-The House of the Rising Sun

-Which Side are you on

-Cocaine Blues

-Where Have all the Flowers gone

-Whiskey in the Jar

-Minglewood blues?

-Red River Valley is one.

-Foggy Mnt. Breakdown

-Cripple Creek

-You Are My Sunshine

-The Cat Came Back

-Old Dan Tucker

-Cripple Creek

-Barbara Allen

-Don't Ask Why It's Alright

-Stagger Lee

-Omie Wise

-Delia

-Stackalee

-Moonshiner

-Corrina

-Long Black Veil

-Wayfaring Stranger

-This Little Light of Mine

-We Shall Overcome

-Little Boxes

-Midnight Special

-Michael Row the Boat Ashore

-If I Had a Hammer

-Home on the Range

This is becoming a long list, but I feel it to be nice as a way to see what the community sees as definitive listening (and learning if you're into that sort of thing).

Can anyone recommend either some artists or some songs where the songs tell a story? Famous examples would be Whiskey in the Jar, Irish Rover etc, but I'm from Liverpool so we're pretty swamped in Irish folk songs. Can anyone recommend some Scottish, Welsh or English folk songs? 

Many thanks, and here's Baloo my Boy. I recommend the movie!

Personally, I can't stand the people who think having an acoustic guitar or novel (I say novel because the bands guilty of this don't seem to be using them sincerely, but rather to fit an image they've come up with for themselves) instruments such as banjo, cello, or whistling means it must be folk. Also, the amount of bands out there with awful vocals, whether it be generic or the overly sentimental, cloying and whiny kind. But what bugs me the most is that the bands who clearly don't draw inspiration from the great folk musicians of the past have come to represent the 'genre' (I say that loosely) much moreso than those who rightfully deserve to.
