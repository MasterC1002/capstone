Hey @OnionSports, you know I'm perfectly capable of writing biting satire about myself, right? All you have to do is ask :p

Ok, @OnionSports. Here's how it should have gone. Wall o' text incoming. Also, naughty words. #braceyourselves

**WARNING. THE FOLLOWING IS SATIRE. IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE INTERNET, LEAVE NOW**

A day after being cut by the Minnesota Vikings, former punter Chris Kluwe penned an impassioned online screed chastising the entire state of Minnesota for not caring a single whit about his histrionic outbursts on basically anything he felt would make him somewhat relevant in the modern news cycle. 

""How dare you snot-felching turkeyshits ignore my desperate cries for attention,"" Kluwe wrote, while smashing together multiple run on sentences about the plight of the not at all endangered American prairie dog. ""I swear to raptor Jesus, if my name isn't somewhere in the media or on the front page of Reddit in three fucking seconds, I'm going to light your mother's nipple hairs on fire with her own explosive flatulence."" 

Kluwe then went on another four page rant about the dangers of poorly maintained water heaters, using such ludicrous phrases like ""Satan's vomiting crotchsphincter,"" and ""turgid camel cocks,"" interspersed with punting stats that not one single person gives a solitary fuck about, and frankly, wishes didn't exist. 

When asked for comment, multiple people who claimed they knew Chris Kluwe said, ""Isn't he that whiny dude with the stupid hair?"" and, ""What the fuck is a punter?"" Kluwe's mother reached out to the Onion and told them her son had died of dysentery twenty five years ago, and whoever claiming to be him now was undoubtedly ""some turdgobbling famewhore.""

We will do the best we can to defeat our mortal enemy from Chicago, but we cannot make any promises. You control your destiny. Win and you're in, regardless of what we do. I cannot stand to see a team like the Bears who have bought so much of their talent from trades and free agency get into the playoffs while teams like the Vikings who drafted their talent and raised their players get the cold shoulder come January. Don't just do it for yourselves. Do it for all the people who doubted AP would recover to his old self. Do it for all the young QBs who have been a center for blame. Do it for all the teams that have ever been doubted by incompetent sport analysts who cannot truly understand what a good team is. Blow. Some. Minds.

1363311762.0	1abohy	On Ponder, and the Cassel signing. 	urbanchatter	121	15	139	"I agree that the Vikings should be able to take advantage of play action pass much more often than they do. However, the options were somewhat limited when it came to downfield threats; and after Harvin's injury, there really was no threat for receiving until Wright. I think it is premature to say that Ponder won't be good.  I know arm strength was a big complaint coming out of college, but he has also bulked up a bit since then.  Twice at the end of the season, Ponder unloaded to Wright on very similar passes.  The first was overthrown, if I remember correctly, and the second was a 65 yd touchdown.  That pass against the Packers hit Wright in full stride at a little over 50 yards.  That was a beautiful pass, and shows what Ponder is capable of down field.  He also had a bomb to Wright against Detroit. Throwing off his front foot on the run (threw off his front foot, but didn't really get to step into it) from his own 41, the ball traveled 53 yards in the air to Detroit's 5 yard line.

     

Not only has he shown that he can drop a long ball occasionally, but he and Wright (who will have a much larger role given the recent departure of Percy Harvin) have shown some chemistry given limited exposure. If the Vikings can get another downfield threat who can spread the field, (hopefully through the draft and not Jennings), then I think we will truly be able to judge Ponders ability.  Don't misunderstand me, Jennings is a great, great receiver, but too similar to what we have, and a role I sincerely believe Wright can fulfill.  Alas, I digress. 

     

He has thrown some nice balls, and tight spirals.  He has also thrown some terrible passes, and made some even worse decisions.  Inconsistency should be expected from a guy who has only played in 27 games. Consistency will come with experience, and a more diverse receiving corp.  



I'm certainly not saying that if you give him time, then he will be good. I'm simply saying that he might be.  Like it or not, The Vikings organization has committed to Ponder.  He is going to get the starts, and the chance to prove he deserves them no matter what.  



I love the Cassel signing, but only if you realize he will be competing for 2nd string.  Lets be real here, Cassel has had the chance to prove he should be a starter in the NFL. And while he certainly has played well on many occasions, he has been wholly underwhelming.  It will certainly put more pressure on Ponder, but not nearly as much as true competition for starting.  In fact, I think it puts just the right amount of pressure.  He now knows that his backup is a guy who could conceivably take his job if he has a string of bad performances.  But, he also knows that the Vikings are going to give him the chance to prove himself.  Signing Cassel only adds to the likelihood of him improving, as he now has a seasoned quarterback, who has a similar skill set, and can help him grow in the game.   



Hopefully, Ponder will pan out.  I personally, think he has the ability to be a consistently good (not average, good) quarterback in the NFL,  but only time will tell if he does not. Given the very limited supply of quality quarterbacks in this years draft and free agency, giving Ponder another year to develop really makes the most sense.  No quarterback the Vikings could have gotten this year would come in and perform heads and tails above Ponder.  And, if in fact Ponder does not pan out, then it won't have made much of a difference if the Vikings give him next year to play.  


tldr;
Cut the guy some slack.  You'll be putting up with him for at least the next season, so better to look at the positives than the negatives.

Ole and Sven die in a snowmobiling accident, drunker than skunks, and go to Hell.

The Devil observes that they are really enjoying themselves. He says to them 'Doesn't the heat and smoke bother you? Ole replies, 'Vell, ya know, ve're from nordern Minnesooota, da land of snow an ice, an ve're yust happy fer a chance ta varm up a little bit, ya know.'

The devil decides that these two aren't miserable enough and turns up the heat even more.

When he returns to the room of the two guys from Minnesota , the devil finds them in light jackets and hats, grilling Walleye and drinking beer.

The devil is astonished and exclaims, 'Everyone down here is in abject misery, and you two seem to be enjoying yourselves?'

Sven replies, 'Vell, ya know, ve don't git too much varm veather up dere at da Falls, so ve've yust got ta haff a fish fry vhen da veather's dis nice.'

The devil is absolutely furious. He can hardly see straight Finally he comes up with the answer.

The two guys love the heat because they have been cold all their lives. The devil decides to turn all the heat off in Hell. The next morning, the temperature is 60 below zero, icicles are hanging everywhere, and people are shivering so bad that they are unable to wail, moan or gnash their teeth.

The devil smiles and heads for the room with Ole and Sven. He gets there and finds them back in their parkas, bomber hats, and mittens. They are jumping up and down, cheering, yelling and screaming like mad men.

The devil is dumbfounded, 'I don't understand, when I turn up the heat you're happy. Now its freezing cold and you're still happy. What is wrong with you two?'

They both look at the devil in surprise and say 'Vell, don't ya know, if hell iss froze over, dat must mean da Vikings von da Super Bow!'﻿

* Musgrave started the season a moron, ended it looking like he may be onto something, and than inexplicably decided yesterday that we should go to shotgun every time we're 3rd and 2 when our backup QB is in. 


* I don't understand how the Packers, maybe the oldest and most storied franchise in the NFL, hasn't managed to come up with a better fight song than a 2 second synth hook, followed by ""Go Pack Go"". 

* Usually after the season I start to think about which positions we absolutely have to bolster, and it's less obvious this year. receiving, I suppose, but we have ourselves a pretty kick ass foundation for next season. There is a lot to look forward to.

* I will be purchasing a number 22 jersey soon. Smith is going to have one hell of a career.

* Webb, we'll miss you, but your full time job has been to be ready when we needed you, and you were clearly in way over your head. Take care buddy. No hard feelings. Ever since Cunningham, half the Vikes' fan base is convinced that the backup QB is the solution to all of our problems, and it annoys me to no end. Joe, if you've done nothing else but cure folks of this delusion, I salute you.

* If you told your bartender at the beginning of the year that the Vikings were going to the playoffs this season, he would have cut you off and taken your keys. This season was nothing short of a huge success, and there is plenty to look forward to next year. I'm proud of our boys.

I grew up in MN and all my family resides there.  I live and work in Wisconsin and everyone I work with loved the Cassel signing because they can't wait to watch ""the drama"" unfold at the QB position in Minny.

""We've got Rodgers and we're so great - Ponder sucks and we're doomed. Good luck with Ponder, Jennings!"" 

2012 was Ponder's first full season at starting QB and he led the team to a playoff berth! What more could a team want from their quarterback in his first full year starting?

Aaron Rodgers and Christian Ponder have nearly identical completion percentages in both of their first full years at the starting position.  Christian had way less depth at WR last year than AR ever did in 2008.

I know you catch my drift, but this guy needs a chance. We haven't given him one yet.

Now that he's got Jennings - we'll be making defenses think twice about how many guys they put in the box.   Adrian or force Ponder to throw it to one of the best receivers in the league? 

Pick your poison baby.  It's going to be a fun year to be a Vikings fan!

I'm jacked. Screw the doubters #7 - let's kick some ass. Skol.

Welp, maybe that will give McCarthy the false confidence he needs in Crosby to have them try more field goals, I mean, he can only miss the ones he has the chance to take

------------------------------------

halftime, I hope I don't run out of room

--------------------------------------

Even though we forgot how to tackle, please keep running it

**I MISS PAT WILLIAMS SO FREAKING MUCH IT HURTS**

Not for the year, but for right now...Griffin &gt; Robison

How about a nice long drive that ends in a TD?!

CONGRATS ON 2K AD!

Doesn't matter, this is not going to be easy either way...let's see what we're made of...gut check time

The Packers won't get punished because they're the Packers and the officials are in their pocket.  GOD DAMMIT

Peterson time...screen pass time too...jeez

**FUCKING LOADHOLDT**

Ok defense, we really really need a stop.  Do something good.  Quit trying to give this away, and the young guys need to stop being overwhelmed...this is their game, we have it, just keep playing the whole time

HOLD THEM HOLD THEM HOLD THEM

Ummm Crosby...Stop making them............sigh

**HOLYFUCKINGSHITHOLYFUCKINGSHITHOLYFUCKINGSHIT HOLYFUCKINGSHITHOLYFUCKINGSHIT HOLYFUCKINGSHITHOLYFUCKINGSHIT**

It makes me proud to know that there is someone who is willing to use his influence to try to make a positive difference on issues that so many other athletes and celebrities try to avoid.

Seriously...I have a lot of trust in Spielman...but let's not screw this up.  This is a HUGELY important draft for us

It's funny watching this predraft stuff...because they're not good at predicting...at all.  I could do as good of a job as Kiper, but I don't have as nice hair

**WOOOOOOOO**

Official prediction of this moderator.............Teo with 23 and trade down to top of rd 2 with 25

hnnnngggggg HURRY UP

You guys are awfully quiet

I can't get my windows adjusted properly...this is annoying

**1st Pick - KC - Eric Fisher**

Whoa...ok...not Joekel...interesting.  Kalil is way better

**2nd Pick - JAX - Luke Joeckel**

Kalil is still better...safe pick for Jax

**3rd pick - MIA (traded from OAK swap 1st rds and added 2nd rd 41) - Dion Jordan**

Whoa whoa whoa...damn surprising.  I also surprised myself just now by eating way way way too much pizza and wings.  Holy crap.  If I stop updating it means I died from cheese and chicken clogging my heart shut

**4th pick - PHIL - Lane Johnson**

Mike Vick might not get murdered quite as much this year.  Make no mistake, he still will only play 4.5 games, but that's better than 2...which is what he would have played behind that line.  Kalil is a billion times better...and his name isn't Lane

First mention here of it...but the Cowboys hopefully will pick a WR or Kenny Vaccaro, so I can laugh for the next 5 months at their GM's dumbness

Will DET take Milliner?????????  I think so

**5th pick - DET - Ezekiel Ansah**

Oh boy....dude has bust written all over him...their line could be scary if he was good.  Should have taken Milliner or the dude from FSU.  Silly risky pick

**6th pick - CLE -  Barkevious Mingo**

SERIOUSLY WTF CLEVELAND???  DO YOU WANT TO BE GOOD OR NOT?  YOU SURE AREN'T ACTING LIKE YOU DO

**7th pick - ARI - Jonathan Cooper**

Makes sense and makes sense...he's better than our guards

**8th pick - STL (traded from BUF a bunch of picks holy crap Buffalo made out like a bandit and got to screw over the Jets in the process) Tavon Austin**

Good pick for them...they need it and a RB....and an OLine....and a DLine...and a coach who isn't praised for going 8-8 every year

**9th pick - NYJ (they're crying right now...true story) - Dee Milliner**

Needed...they're going to be awful next year...awful.

**10th pick - TEN - Chance Warmack**

Great pick...I'd love to have him.  He's badass and probably the best player drafted so far.  Yeah, I looked over the picks and he is the best guy drafted so far by miles

**11th pick - SD - DJ Fluker**

Needed pick...but ahahahahahahahahahahahaha he's not that good.  Reminds Mayock of Loadholdt...so lots of offsides and holdings to be called on SD next year

**12th pick - OAK - DJ Hayden**

What the fuck...how did they not pick Floyd?????????????  Well...ok...I wonder how much it will cost to go get him...because the Vikes NEED to think about it, badly

Do the Jets grab a QB?  I can only hope

**13th pick - NYJ - Sheldon Richardson**

Good pick, but they're still going to suck...can he play qb?  That's the more important question

**14th pick - CAR - Star Lotulelei**

Stud that, apparently, gets sleepy easily 

**15th pick - NO - Kenny Vaccaro**

I was sooooooo hoping the Cowboys would take him.  Whatever, screw the saints and screw the cowboys

**16th pick - BUF - EJ MANUEL**

HOLY CRAP WTF NO WAY HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA....Ponder's back-up/replacement....as someone who watches FSU all the time, because of *reasons* he's pretty mediocre.  Bad pick, could have got him in rd 2.  

**17th pick - PITT - Jarvis Jones**

Is it our pick yet?  Can we get Floyd now?  Please

**18th pick - SF (trade from DAL) - Eric Reid**

what

not kidding

what

well

wat

maybe

what

**19th pick - NYG - Justin Pugh**

NOW...do the Bears DARE to take the TEO???!?!?!?!  I say no...we'll see

**20th pick - CHI - Kyle Long**

WHEW WHEW WHEW...they needed that...we need the TEO

**21st pick - CIN - Tyler Eifert**

is Floyd seriously going to fall to us?  Totally crazy...especially if the falcons pick Rhodes like they should

**22nd pick - ATL - Desmond Trufant**

Holy crap, our pick is in

**23rd pick - MIN - SHARIF FLOYD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

WOOHOOO OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**O**

**M**

**G**

**!**

Speechless...that's so cool!

**24th pick - IND - Bjoern Werner**

TEO IS OURS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**25th pick - MIN - Xavier Rhodes!!!!!!!!**

WHOA WHOA WHOA I'M SHOCKED AND SURPRISED AND SHOCKED AND SURPRISED

AND SHOCKED

AND SURPRISED

and we have no MLB...can we get back into the 1st round?  Do we have to?  THESE ARE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS!!!!!

6 more picks

**26th pick - GB - ~~a bag of poop~~ Datone Jones**

Didn't want to run the ball anyway

**27th pick - HOU - DeAndre Hopkins**

Still can't believe we had those picks...and trying to figure out how we're going to get back into the first **OMG WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO GET BACK INTO THE FIRST ROUND HOLY CRAP**

**28th pick - DEN -Sylvester Williams**

ARE WE GETTING BACK INTO THE FIRST?????????????????????????

**ARE WE GETTING BACK INTO THE FIRST??!?!?!?!?!?!?**

WE DID WE DID AND HOLY SHIT WE PAID FOR IT...highway robbery holy shit.  GOTTA BE TEO

**29th pick - MIN - Cordarrelle Patterson!!**

WOW NO TEO WOW WOW WOW I HOPE HE CAN CATCH!

Jesus, that was absolutely crazy....seriously.  I'm not sure I would have given that many picks for a guy so raw

This also means no ROBERT WOODS...which makes me super super sad.  Dammit.  And no MLB which is a HUGE PROBLEM. 

WAIT ONE DAMN SECOND, CAN WE TRADE BACK INTO THE FIRST ROUND AGAIN??????!!?!

No?  we can't?  Well, shit

**30th pick - STL - Alec Ogletree**

This has been an absolutely INSANE draft...glad the Rams are committed to being 8-8 forever

If the cowboys pick a WR or RB my night will be made...for sure no doubt...because Jerry Jones is Al davis, and when you tell cowboys fans that they get really really mad

**31st pick - DAL - Travis Frederick**

DAMMIT

**32nd pick - BAL Matt Elam**

Not Teo....THERE IS STILL HOPE THAT WE CAN GET HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Is there anyone dumb enough at the top of rd 2 to trade their pick for Toby?

That will keep me up tonight.

Day 1 of the 2013 NFL draft has been a MONSTROUS SUCCESS!!!!

Join us tomorrow for part 2 (even though we, in theory, don't have any picks until forever from now)

Sidebar will be updated tomorrow as well and pictures and stuff

1352296148.0	12so6k	Thoughts from a factoid-obsessed Bears fan	avocategory	85	17	24	"I was thinking about the way that schedules are constructed, with each team playing its own division, an AFC division, and NFC division, and then the remaining two teams in its conference that placed the same in their divisions.  I was wondering why the nfl specified that last bit for the remaining two games; then I realized that with that bit, each team plays 4 teams that finished 1st in their division the previous year, 4 teams that finished 2nd, 4 that finished 3rd, and 4 that finished 4th, regardless of how you finish, because those two games make up for the fact that you don't play yourself in your division.

So, you can break each team's season into quarters based on how it fared against 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th place teams.  The funny thing about that, when applied to the Vikings?  Well, so far:

You're 1-0 against 1st place teams (49ers)

You're 3-0 against 2nd place teams (Lions, Titans, &amp; Cardinals)

You're 1-1 against 3rd place teams (Jaguars &amp; Seahawks)

You're 0-3 against 4th place teams (Bucs, Colts, &amp; Redskins)

Now, that's pretty weird; the better a team did in 2011, the more likely the Vikings are to beat them.  But, if we assume your percentages hold up within each tier, you'll sweep the Packers, Texans, and Lions, split the games with the Bears, and lose to the Rams, for a final record of 10-6, which probably makes the playoffs (you'd hold the tiebreaker against everyone in the NFC North, by being 2-0 against Packers and Lions, and having a better division record than the Bears).

It's a silly assumption to make.  But then, a lot of people would have said before this season that the Vikings winning more than 4 games would be silly."	t5_2qocl	True

One of those clubs is the Washington Redskins, to whom Winfield paid a visit this week; another is the Minnesota Vikings, who released him in the hours ahead of the start of free agency on March 12. Despite that proverbial slap in the face from Minny, Winfield is apparently open to a return to the club.

Dan Wiederer of the Star Tribune provided an in-depth look at the situation in a post this week. One of the reasons why Winfield would return to Minnesota is that he'd be continuing to play in a familiar city, with familiar teammates and coaches and a familiar defensive system; per the scribe, this is an aspect that Winfield does not take lightly. Moreover, money is not the sole determining factor in this situation, and it may not be the most important one, either; according to Wiederer, Winfield is more interested in an acquiring team's chances at contending for a title. That may actually help the Redskins and harm the Vikings, but it's a matter of opinion which of those two teams is more suited for success in 2013.

There's no sense that a decision by Winfield is imminent, and there's also been reports of another team in the mix. But it certainly seems like there's a reasonable chance he could be back in a Vikings uniform this fall."	t5_2qocl	True

Greetings from the Land of Cheese!

A few weeks ago I posted [this infographic](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1cy1kc/i_created_a_visual_history_of_the_green_bay/) I made for the Packers. It was inspired by [this chart](http://www.edmontonjournal.com/sports/hockey/edmonton-oilers/history/index.html) (though sadly mine does not include the nifty hover info). At the request of a Vikings fan on r/NFL I created one for for you folks as well.  The information was primarily procured via Wikipedia as well as a bit from Vikings.com. When I did the Packer chart, I figured I had completely lucked out on the uniforms however it turns out there's a website called Heritage Sports Art that does paintings of all of the uniforms (lucky me!).

----------------------------

there will be a lot of cursing tonight, apologies in advance

------------------

I don't know if you all have noticed, but I have, we have had a lot of *coughPackerscoughcough* visitors in the subreddit the past few days.  So please be liberal with the upvotes, because they've been downvoting the crap out of some stuff

One hour to kickoff....uff da this will be FUN! 

Regardless of who our QB is **LET'S GET IT ON!!!!!!!!  GAME ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**  Good luck all, have fun and away we goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

If we win we should get to chop off Clay Matthews' goldie locks

--------------------------

I'll take that return, I REALLY want to see more Wright returning kickoffs

Peterson pounds, win game...simple.  I like this game plan A LOT

**JOE FUCKING WEBB**

I bet we can win this game without attempting a pass.  How incredible would that be.  Unfreakingstoppable

Call a sweep over Matthews now!  DO IT

Settle down back there, Joe...settle down

OMG THAT WAS TOO CLOSE DON'T MESS WITH ME LIKE THAT BLAIR!

Put Rodgers on his ass.  A lot.  I'll be even happy with an early roughing the passer, just so he knows we're there...nothing over the top.

**TACKLE GOD DAMMIT**

Nice super quick 3 and out, holy crap...I;ll take that all night long.  Looks like our qb isn't the only nervous one.  Good.  Let's go up by 2 scores

**THAT** was a good playcall!

Good pass and catch, easy and get that confidence.  Rudolph is good

MY HEART STOPPED DON'T DO THAT, JOE.  AND CALL RUNS MUSGRAVE, WHAT THE FUCK.  WE'RE NOT GOING TO WIN IF YOU MAKE IT TOO COMPLICATED.  WE'RE TORCHING THEM WITH THE RUN SO FAR FOR FUCK'S SAKE AND THEY ***KNOW*** IT'S COMING!!  KEEP DOING IT, DON'T GET TOO SMART

I miss Pat Williams...so very very very much

Please no more penalties like that....please.

So close for Allen, so freaking close

**WRAP UP YOUR TACKLES AAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG**

We're getting screen passed to death....I WONDER IF THAT WOULD WORK IF YOU HAVE AN ALL-WORLD RUNNING BACK??!?!

Good lord, defense....good freaking lord...

**Pat**

**Williams**

Uggggg, that was an absolutely horrible series, everything was awful.

WE need to dial it back and play more towards our strengths...ground and pound baby OR SCREEN PASS LEFT!!

One more quick thought on that defensive drive...if we're not going to cover the middle (which obviously we're not) why don't we blitz Brinkley up the gut and collapse the pocket a bit, so Rodgers can't continue to step up all night long

POUND POUND POUND

Bleh **STOP DOING THAT JOE STOP STOP STOP STOP STOP STOP!!  DON'T LET HIM BACK ON THE FIELD UNTIL HE PROMISES NOT TO DO THAT ANYMORE**

Need a big stop now

The soft middle is KILLING us

Awesome!!!  **SEE, GOOD THINGS HAPPEN WHEN YOU COLLAPSE THE MIDDLE!!**

Stopped...everyone breathe...

Peterson in so close to breaking one.

Sigh...that was a GREAT punt at least

How about a STOP...let's see what Crosby has tonight...or not...Jesus.  HOLD HOLD HOLD

At least Finley's hands are consistent.......

That was HUGE!  BIG HUGE STUFF!  Welp, obviously Crosby can kick extra points tonight

Joe has a cannon, an inaccurate cannon, but a cannon none the less

This is awful offense, from playcalling to execution to everything...this is TERRIBLE.

Defense too, I guess they all just decided to head to the lockerroom 5 minutes ago

UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF.  That looked easy.

Should we put in the call for MBT?  Because why the hell not

Screw it, I'm having some ice cream

---------------

Bad half is over, now it's time for the good half!!!!!!  Also, this ice cream is really stinking good!

------------------

We're only 2 scores down ATM, need some help but it's not out of hand yet.  Defense needs to step up.  We do need more Everson with Robison not being 100%

So close....so very close

It wasn't close that time, we aren't going to do crap if he has all day like that.  

There is a LOT of time left, we have to play it out

I still &lt;3 Harrison

You.  Have.  To.  Be.  Kidding.  Me.

Ouch...that one hurt bad.  

One more series for Webb, then we HAVE to go to MBT.  HAVE TO.  There is, literally, no reason not to.

A first down would be nice

It's the little things now...KEEP GOING THIS DOESN'T SUCK KEEP GOING!  More easy passes.  I said **EASY** passes

Wright doesn't suck...at all.  He and Jenkins can stay

WE HAVE to go for it.  Welp....it's kind of like it was just an incomplete pass.  SILVER LINING FOLKS...SILVER LINING!

Oh no................OH NO!  GET UP HARRISON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  **GET UP!!!!!!**  He got up...whew

**WE GOT A STOP!!!!!!!!**

Can we put in MBT now, because why not?

OH GOD.......................................just stop with Webb.  I'm starting to feel bad for him.  Damn damn damn.  He's not even close to ready for this

You have got to be shitting me.  Wow.

OOOOOOOO JOSH!!!!!!!  He's pretty good too!  

Look, Joe Webb, from everything I've seen, read, heard, whatever, is a really good dude, but GET HIM THE FUCK OUT OF THE GAME.  I feel so bad for him right now.  Our whole team is being completely DOMINATED, let's not get anyone hurt who matters and play some deep bench guys so they can tell their kinds they played in a playoff game.  Dammit

We lost this game because we were completely outclassed in every aspect of it.  Screw the Packers, but they beat our asses fair and square...so all props to them.  

AD is still a MF'ing beast, but if he gets hurt, I swear to GOD...............

Look, this year has been a MASSIVE success, beyond what 99% of anyone could have possibly hoped.  And for the first time in a very very very long time, this roster is getting full of young talented players.

**TOUCHDOWN 2 SCORE GAME!**

Still sucks...anyway.  We have a bright future and really good things to look forward to...so keep your heads up, and we'll try to have good stuff here between now and the draft.  Check back when you can.  **NOW BACK TO YOUR REGULAR SCHEDULED GAME COMMENTARY**

Wide receivers have been open downfield all game long, it's too bad that it tok 'til 5 minutes were left in the 4th quarter for Webb to get the ball to one.  This sucks, but alas....

Should we try to have a consensus team that this subreddit roots for?  I'd nominate the Seahawks

Jenkins still doesn't suck.

Thanks for the year all, keep coming back!  We'll keep the reddit going with content and fun.

Greg Jennings Diversifies Vikings

The former Packer helps the passing game, but also helps Adrian Peterson

by KC Joyner

A case can be made that very few playoff teams in NFL history had a more one-sided offense than the 2012 Minnesota Vikings. The Purple and Gold had the presence of possibly the best power running back since Earl Campbell (Adrian Peterson), a fact that should theoretically have opened up passing lanes. Defenses facing Peterson have to be constantly conscious of Peterson the runner and Peterson the pass-catcher. And yet the Vikings ended the season with one of the worst passing attacks in the league.

What was already a deficiency took another hit when Percy Harvin was traded to the Seattle Seahawks for a collection of three draft picks earlier this week.

Those elements were likely a huge reason the Vikings signed free-agent wide receiver Greg Jennings to a five-year deal on Friday.

Jennings, with 425 catches and 6,537 yards in seven seasons with the Packers, will obviously upgrade Minnesota's passing game, but by how much? Is he enough to get this aerial attack to the point where it can keep defenses from keying on stopping Peterson, thus give All Day an even better chance at breaking the single-season rushing yardage record?

To find this out, let's start by establishing some benchmarks.

Vikings quarterback Christian Ponder had abysmal showings in the vertical yards per attempt (9.2) and stretch vertical YPA (10.2) categories in 2012. (Note: vertical passes are those attempts thrown 11 or more yards downfield; stretch verticals are thrown 20 or more yards.)

His performance on downfield passes also got worse as the season progressed -- from Weeks 12-17, Ponder went 2-for-15 for 90 yards, zero touchdowns and one interception on stretch vertical passes. Simply put, in the final third of the season the Vikings had no field-stretching pass game to speak of (although, to be fair, some of that had to do with being able to lean on Peterson so heavily).

Those numbers start to look even worse when Harvin's targets are subtracted from the equation, as he accounted for 246 of Ponder's 744 yards at the medium depth level (defined as aerials that traveled 11-19 yards through the air). Harvin also racked up a 7.2 YPA on short passes (thrown 10 or fewer yards), a number that was much higher than the 5.6 team YPA on those throws when Harvin's short passes are removed from the total.

Now that the current state of matters has been determined, what does Jennings do to help?

His 2012 season doesn't tell us much because a torn groin muscle and the associated rust that goes with missing practice time reduced Jennings to weak marks in overall YPA (6.5) and vertical YPA (5.5).

But since Jennings should enter this season fully healthy, a better barometer for what he can do for this offense can be found in his 2011 YPA figures. In that campaign, Jennings ranked 14th in the league in vertical YPA (14.0) and seventh in stretch vertical YPA (20.8). He had similar stat showings in 2010 (14.5 vertical YPA, ranked 10th; 16.3 stretch vertical YPA, ranked 20th), so it can be assumed that those numbers were not anomalies.

The issue with using those totals as his potential impact point is that even though his metrics look great from an overall perspective, they really don't stand out from a Green Bay perspective.

For example, in 2010, Jennings ranked second among wide receivers on the Packers in vertical YPA and was third in stretch vertical YPA. He does get the benefit of the doubt in that season since he had nearly as many vertical (62) and stretch vertical targets (27) as the other three top wide receivers on the club combined (86 vertical, 35 stretch vertical), but that doesn't explain the 2011 season.

In that year, Jordy Nelson outpaced Jennings in both vertical and stretch vertical YPA while besting him in targets at those depth levels. Nelson and James Jones also fared better than Jennings in YPA when facing tough cornerbacks.

All of this leads to the conclusion that, at least to a certain extent, Jennings was a product of the Packers' passing system. So instead of assuming Jennings will bring a vertical YPA of 14 to 15 yards to Minnesota, let's count on him being more of a midrange target in the passing game, which would be somewhere around a 12-yard vertical YPA mark.

With that figure in mind, we can now get an idea of what Jennings would do for this offense.

To do this, let's factor out Harvin and his 10.8 vertical YPA on 21 targets. If those are taken out, Ponder had exactly 100 vertical targets last year and posted an 8.8 vertical YPA on those throws.

If Jennings racks up a 12.0 vertical YPA on 50 of those throws and the other 50 throws end up posting an 8.8 vertical YPA (which assumes no other improvements among the receivers), it would equal 1040 yards on 100 throws, or a 10.4 vertical YPA.

History says that type of performance will place a quarterback right around or just below the middle of the league in that very important metric. It might not sound exciting, but it tells us the mere presence of Jennings would make this move worth it, and if the rest of the receiving corps steps up in any appreciable manner on vertical passes -- and that could include a draft pick -- Ponder could make a push toward the top 15 in that mark.

This is not to say the move is a slam-dunk to work, as Ponder and Jennings still need to go out there and make it happen. In fact, Jennings could be on the receiving end of throws from Matt Cassel depending on how training camp and preseason goes. Having said that, if the past is any indicator, Jennings should be able to make defenses pay the price for devoting too much attention to stopping Peterson and thus give Minnesota a strong chance to make back-to-back playoff appearances for only the second time since the 2000 season."	t5_2qocl	True

1375556440.0	1jn0ii	/r/minnesotavikings Fantasy Football leagues official sign up--PM ME THIS INFO!	McRawffles	64	10	9	"INFO NEEDED:

1) What is your e-mail? (We need this for the league sign-ups)

2) How many years of FF experience do you have? (Is this your first season, second, etc.)

3) (Optional) Do you have a league preference between NFL.com and ESPN Fantasy Football?

4) (Optional) Are you willing to manage a league? (We *might* need one more manager, somewhat unsure though)

Why am I asking for experience? Because I'd like to sort of group people by it. I ideally want to avoid a league that has 10 people who have played 2+ seasons of fantasy and 2 that haven't played at all. It wouldn't be fun for those two who hadn't played.

Please please please PLEASE **only sign up for a league if you're planning on being active.** Don't quit assigning starters if you're having a bad season and giving free wins away.

Each league will be a 12-man league. Draft dates will be determined league-wise, although all aiming before season's start.

**REWARD:** After talking with /u/swampsparrow, the winners of *each* league will get a custom flair once the fantasy football season is done, designed by yours truly. The highest scoring non-winner team from each league will also receive a custom flair.

You have all weekend to get me this info. No rush. We're going to be sending invites out to people who want to play slowly.

Nighttime update: I think we have a 4th manager. We have 43 people total right now.

The invites will be rolling out ~~tomorrow and Monday~~???-- I'm going to give another day for the last few people, and for our 4th league manager to set up his/her league.

There are some new people, but not nearly enough to fill a league, so I'm going to intermingle them with experienced people and try to balance it that way.

Sunday night update: 67 people. So. That's a lot. So I've had to ask from more managers from the group. 

The invites are going to go out sometime this week then. I'm still waiting to hear back from some of the people I've requested to be managers, and waiting on them to set up their leagues. I'm not sending the lists out to the managers until I get a confirmation that all the leagues are set up."	t5_2qocl	True

My takes:

**Kalil** - The logical pick. Couldn't have missed between Claiborne and Kalil, glad they went with the move that will keep Ponder upright. Charlie Johnson can move inside, this move improves 3 positions. (LT, LG, QB). Also, they picked up 3 extra picks at the expense of the Browns and still got their guy, so this may be the best selection of the draft.

http://www.nfl.com/combine/profiles/matt-kalil?id=2533131

**Smith** - A great fit in the cover 2, Vikings get the #2 safety in a weak safety draft. He will have to really flounder not to be a starter week 1. Any draft you can get 2 starters out of day one is a good draft.

http://www.nfl.com/combine/profiles/harrison-smith?id=2532948

**Robinson** - Vikings channel al Davis and take the fastest guy in the draft. Been clocked sub 4.3 in the 40 time. Also had a great 20 yard shuttle vertical and broad jump. He will likely compete to be a starting corner, but more likely will not open the year at that position. Really like this pick.

http://www.nfl.com/combine/profiles/josh-robinson?id=2533542

**Wright** - A burner at WR, gives the Vikings another deep threat. It will be interesting to see if Ponder can develop that aspect of his game. Downfield passing was poor last season, but the wide receivers the vikings ran out there were not very good. Wright is likely in competition for the #4 WR spot in competition with another Arkansas WR the Vikings selected Greg Childs. He also will compete with Robinson for return duties as Harvin is no longer going to be out there.

http://www.nfl.com/combine/profiles/jarius-wright?id=2532978

**Ellison** - When ESPN listed him as a FB I was scratching my head. But he'll likely play an H-Back role. Blocking TE part of the time, lead blocker on other downs. Ok pick. Probably a candidate to end up on the practice squad or not with the team

http://www.nfl.com/combine/profiles/rhett-ellison?id=2532835

**Childs** - An Arkansas pipeline is starting to materialize in Minnesota. Vikings get a possession receiver to compliment the downfield threats they've added this offseason in Simpson and Wright. Should compete to be a #4 this season.

http://www.nfl.com/combine/profiles/greg-childs?id=2533334

**Blanton** - A corner at ND, likely a safety in the NFL. Vikings are getting really heavy with former Irish (Carlson, Rudolph, Smith and Blanton). If Blanton impresses he's going to have a shot at starting. The Vikings are incredibly weak at safety and any new blood will be good for the position. I hope this pick does not mean Abdullah is not re-signed. Despite his concussions I think he has a chance to be a starter 

http://www.nfl.com/combine/profiles/robert-blanton?id=2532794

**Walsh** - A head scratcher of a pick.  I did not expect a kicker.  He's hit some long ones at UGA, so perhaps he can find a niche as a kick off specialist to begin with, ore more likely be stashed in the practice squad as Longwell's eventual replacement.  

http://www.nfl.com/combine/profiles/blair-walsh?id=2533011

**Cole** - Fills a need.  Should add some depth at ILB with Jasper Brinkley being the only rostered ILB that I can name come up with.  

http://www.nfl.com/combine/profiles/audie-cole?id=2532814

**Guyton** - Another depth move.  Hard to really praise or admonish a 7th round pick.  Didn't play much at Cal which is why he dropped this far.  I'll take it.

If (fingers crossed) he's able to pass Dickerson, it's something that we're going to be proud to tell our kids and grandkids about witnessing. A season for the ages - seeing the best to ever do it at his peak.

Don't get me wrong, in an ideal world AD will get the record, we'll be in the playoffs at 10-6 and on to New Orleans...but being realistic, it's unlikely that we're a super bowl caliber team. Maybe we can sneak in the playoffs, but in 10, 15, 25 years down the road - what are we more likely to remember? A 10-6 borderline playoff team, or the greatest single rushing season in NFL history?

Kudos to Adrian, and hats off to the whole team as this is a team effort. I just feel that the best way to acknowledge this teams efforts is by a record setting year by Adrian rather than a playoff entry with a likely early exit. "	t5_2qocl	True

Hopefully, in the future, we will try to make them even more professional looking!

The first half is over and I must say - PATTERSON IS LOOKING DAMN GOOD. Not great, he did have that dropped ball (which still looked really difficult to catch in the first place), but he has made some nice sideline catches and got open. Simpson went full Simpson and blew Ponder's first and only drive, so that wasn't fun. Burton is looking to make the roster, and so is Zack Line - each had long catches, and Line wouldn't have had the TD without Burton's blocking. Sharrif is out for the game, but I'm sure he will be fine. Nothing major at all. He played disruptively when he was in. Cassel is looking like Cassel. There isn't much velocity on the ball and he got sacked fairly easily (albeit, our second string line was terrible). Don't expect Cassel to ever start over a healthy Ponder.

1368145663.0	1e1de6	Vikings respond to Jon Tevlin's Star Tribune editorial.	HoldMeBabyJesus	61	15	23	"On Wednesday, May 8, Star Tribune columnist Jon Tevlin wrote a piece entitled ""Kluwe made an impact on, off the field,"" in which he provides his point of view on the Vikings release of Chris Kluwe and, specifically, the Vikings involvement in the Twin Cities community.  Below is a response penned by Jeff Anderson, Vikings Director of Corporate Communications, and sent to Tevlin via e-mail on Wednesday afternoon.

Jon -

After reading your column titled, ""Kluwe made an impact on, off the field,"" within which I certainly agree regarding Chris' positive effect on the Minnesota community, I question your assumptions about other Vikings players' community involvement. In your piece you indicate the majority of players only participate in charitable causes by letting an organization ""use the player's name or agreeing to the occasional photo op."" You also note, ""Rare is the pro athlete who commits real time, or heaven forbid money, to the charity or issue."" As it relates to the Vikings, neither of those comments has any merit. In fact, the opposite is true; we are fortunate to have individuals throughout the organization, including numerous players, who are committed to giving time and/or money to various causes in our community.

In case you aren't aware, I want to provide you with a few facts about the Vikings community outreach:

1) Player Participation - In six of the seven years, the Vikings have had 100% participation in the team's community outreach program. It is a point of emphasis from the Wilf ownership and Coach Frazier that all of our players, coaches and front office staff get involved in the community.

2) Personal Foundations/Causes - Various players have their own personal foundations or causes, including Chad Greenway (Lead the Way Foundation), Jared Allen (Homes for Wounded Warriors Foundation), Adrian Peterson (All-Day Foundation), Erin Henderson (Erin Henderson's Foundation 50), John Sullivan (University of Minnesota Amplatz Children's Hospital) and many more. General Manager Rick Spielman and VP of Football Operations Rob Brzezinski also host an annual Adoption Family Fun Fest for families from the African American Adoption Agency and Children's Home Society, while Coach Frazier is heavily involved in Fellowship of Christian Athletes and All-Pro Dad.

3) Vikings Children's Fund - Since 1978, the VCF has donated nearly $10 million dollars to helping children and families in Minnesota and the Upper Midwest. Since the Wilfs took ownership of the team, the contributions have increased by nearly 90%. Over the last eight years since 2005, the VCF has averaged annual contributions of approximately $465,000 (over $3.8 million). In the 27 years prior to the Wilf ownership, the team's contributions averaged approximately $245,000 annually.

4) Annual Playground Build - The Vikings Playground Build has become an annual tradition for the team, beginning as an ownership initiative in 2006. The team has completed seven annual builds, replacing playgrounds at elementary schools serving more than 3,000 students, and will complete its eighth at the end of this month.

5) Summer Lunch Program - The Vikings partner with Second Harvest Heartland to help feed underserved children during the summer months when they are not able to receive free or reduced-price lunches through the school. Over the last three summers, the Vikings have helped serve nearly 3,000,000 meals to underserved children.

6) Vikings Fitness Playbook - Last year the team partnered with the University of Minnesota Amplatz Children's Hospital to kick off a campaign to research childhood obesity. That partnership aligns with the team's other ""Play 60"" initiatives, which include the ""Fuel Up to Play 60"" partnership with the Midwest Dairy Association and the United Way partnership that brings assemblies to elementary schools throughout the state.

7) Vikings Youth Football Program - The team provides free youth football clinics every year, selects 10 High School Coaches of the Week and puts together an annual All-State Team to be recognized during a Vikings game. Through the NFL Grassroots program, the team has also contributed $650,000 to replace or repair four area football fields.

8) Saturday Special Guests - The Vikings invite individuals facing a challenging time in their life to a private Saturday practice followed by a meet and greet with the team. Last season's visits included children from the University of Minnesota Amplatz Children's Hospital, the Make-A-Wish Foundation and other organizations/individuals.

I also want to personally invite you to the Vikings mini-camp in June, where I am happy to introduce you to many of the players who have their own foundations. Perhaps then you will better understand the passion that several Vikings players have for giving back and the significant impact their efforts - and those of the entire organization - have on our community.

Please let me know if you would like to attend, and I will follow up with additional details."	t5_2qocl	True
1367328081.0	1depvw	What if Christian Ponder DOES NOT have a breakout season this year?	ragnarockette	60	11	163	"I really hope Christian Ponder has an amazing season. We've certainly worked hard to get him the tools he needs to do so.

...However...what if he doesn't? Most of us feel that three years is a long-enough time to evaluate a quarterback, particularly when he has talent like AP and Jennings around him, and solid protection. If Christian Ponder has another sub-par year, I think most Vikings fans agree, it will be time to re-evaluate. 

What will the post-Ponder plan be? 

Who are the top QB prospects for next year's draft at this point? I think our team is too good to get a high pick - we'd probably have to trade a lot to get a potential franchise-guy. Is that worth it?

Are there any key free agents that will be available? 

Do we try and make a go of it with Matt Cassel? Do we expect him to take many snaps this season? 

Why is there a construction worker outside my window wearing a Steelers sleeveless jersey?

These are questions that need answers. It may be early, but I, for one, have had my Ponder doubts from day one. If this draft pans out like last year, we will be a scarily complete team. QB is a make-or-break position. I want to know what our worst case scenario plan is. "	t5_2qocl	True

I'll follow the team and actively root for that team -- up until they play the Patriots, in which case I have to side with my first true football love. Nothing personal.

Now, that second-favorite team of mine always been the Bears. (Just wait, I can explain.)

It's been a convenient relationship, because the first Super Bowl I ever watched was Super Bowl XXXI -- where the Packers beat the Drew Bledsoe-led Patriots. Even though I was only eight or nine years old at the time, the Packers were the first team I ever identified as the 'bad guys'; so being an honorary Bears fan came natural. Plus I liked their uniform color scheme and picked them in NFL Blitz. When you're that young, stuff like that matters.

I've stuck with the Bears for a while now -- and I still do like the Bears -- but there's nothing I really *love* about them besides Urlacher, who is likely on his way to retirement. I've been finding it difficult to really care about the Bears -- even though their future is bright, Trestman could easily bring out the best in Cutler, and they will likely be in playoff contention for some time -- that spark just isn't there anymore.

And then there's Minnesota. I've tried to deny it but I don't think I can hide my true feelings any longer.. I think I'm starting to fall in love with the Vikings, but I don't know what to do. I'm having a hard time dealing with the perception that I might be labeled a bandwagon fan, or a traitor fair-weather Bears fan. But goddamnit if your team isn't impossible to fall in love with.. between AD, Kluwe, Walsh, Jared Allen, Harvin -- plus how *oddly nice/polite* your entire fanbase seems.. (also, I live in Vermont, so we're cold-weather bros.)

I'm lost, /r/minnesotavikings. How can I find my way? I want to hear from Vikings fans what this team is really like, and what being a Vikings fan is really like? What's the team's management like? What's the team's culture like? What games should I watch if I want to learn more about Vikings history? *Am I a terrible bandwagoner that isn't welcome here?*

This is a very difficult and confusing time for me, any and all advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you.

PS - Does Chris Kluwe ever come around to this sub?

Edit: Thanks everyone for the kind/informational responses, you've done nothing but enforce the perception that the Vikings fanbase is friendly/nice/awesome.

Edit 2: You guys are wonderful salesmen. I made this thread to see if I could maybe develop a connection to the Vikings, and I already feel like I'm starting to. Having only read these comments and watched about five or six Vikings games in my life (what was recommended in this thread and the last few games from this season), I'm hooked. I should say that New England is still my #1 team and always will be -- but I'm really excited to start following the Vikings and hopefully make them my #2 team. There will come a time when the Vikings fortunes take a turn for the better, and when New England's fortunes take a turn for the worse; and when that time comes I will remain a Patriots fan first-and-foremost -- but I'll be proud to consider myself an honorary Vikings enthusiast. **Skol, Vikings bros, skol.**"	t5_2qocl	True

Everyone want's to dog Christian Ponder but when asked about him and the doubt that surrounds him Greg answered this question by saying ""look at who Aaron Rodgers had to throw to last year and look at who Christian had to throw too"".  Only one that jumps out on our team from last year was Rudy, and Harvin who only played 9 games.  And asked about why he left he said"" it was time for a change"" and that he spent 7 good years in GB but it was time to move on.

But the best quote from him was when he said "" In 2010 when we won the Super Bowl in GB in the locker room we were a team determined to do something special you can feel that team chemistry was sound.  When Minnesota lost to us in GB for the Playoff game I could tell it hurt bad for them to lose that game.  When we lost that game against SF I didn't feel that, it hurt yes but it didn't seem like it meant as much as it did in the past.  So far the locker room the feel in Minnesota feels like that room in 2010 with GB, they are a hungry bunch of guys in the locker room you can feel that something special is coming"".  And was asked about being a SB Contender he said ""SSSHHHHH"".  And was asked who should the favorite should be to win the division he said GB, put more pressure on GB and keep the Vikings the team that no one see's coming.

SaturnAscends110	53	8	11	"* 1: To move up nearly an entire round back into THE FIRST, we give up a latish 3rd and an early 4th (7th round = nothing, especially when you have 3 in the round). Check out what others did in trades, how much it took for them to move up and how many spots. 

* 2: You're assuming all three picks, a late 2nd, a late 3rd, and an early 4th round pick will all be GREAT picks. Not just all starters but one being an impact player. What are the chances? or even 2/3 panning out? or even one of them turning into a very good starter in the NFL? Check the histories of players picked at those spots the last few years.

* 3: Wait a second, this is a really deep draft. OK, who do we even take in the 2nd? Hunter, KAllen or Woods? Brown, Teo, or Minter? ALL most likely gone. Great value at CB there but we already took Rhodes. Also probably still good value at DT too, but. So who then? We'd have to go WR, then I guess MLB in the 3rd. So we wouldn't have ended up with one of the top WR everyone wanted so very bad, nor MLB.

* 4: But CP is a bust, he's just so raw, immature, and can't even run routes. All 1st WR are boom or bust basically. Late in the 1st is the perfect spot to take a risk, especially one someone with so much potential. Repeat his potential is sick, CP's potential &gt; Austin's (pure slot WR) potential. Leslie will be a great role model/father figure, Jennings will be the perfect mentor/big brother figure, and we have a great WR coach. Not only is that a great group for him to be around to learn/grow from, he'll be playing with Purple Jesus, which will humble and probably motivate him. Bonus: Moss is his role model. It seems like the perfect fit for him.

* 5: WR's usually don't break out until year 3. Yes, don't expect a Moss rookie year. He'll be able to handle a similar role as Harvin. Not saying he'll do as good or whatever, but what he can do is similar. Special teams, screens, short passes/quick slants, reverses/end arounds, line up in the back field, and of course just go deep. Don't really need to know how to run routes/read D's on all those plays. We shouldn't have a prob getting him enough touches to make an impact. With the ball in his hands he is electric. 

* 6: Even if CP is a major bust, it was worth the risk. Again, chances are very good we wouldn't picked a star with any of those picks. We have a potential star at WR.  It's not like we gave up TWO 1st rounders, a 2nd rounder, and two 4th rounders to move up and take Julio Jones. And by all accounts he has that potential to be an explosive playmaker. 

* 7: 1st round picks get 5 year deals instead of 4 for 2nd rounders. Late first means his salary is very very low for a WR for 5 years. Especially if he pans out.




***Bonus: I still don't think this is necessarily the ideal way it coulda went, but close. If instead, we traded to get another 2nd rounder (early) and take Hunter. Then somehow move up a bit from our other 2nd rounder and get ABrown. Now that would've been the ""perfect"" draft in my mind. But I still love this one and don't think for a second we gave up too much, not at all, considering CP's potential and how bad we needed to get a young stud WR.


tl;dr: Instead of maybe finding 1 pretty good starter and hopefully 2 other decent players...WE FUCKING SWUNG FOR THE FENCES.

See, the thing is, we need the first round bye. We need to rest up our ailing players. Justin Smith said he's going to play in the first playoff game for us, and if you've seen how our defense is without him, you'll know why that's a pretty big deal. So if you guys can help him rest up for just one more week without missing a game, that'd be swell.

Also, I would love for you guys to get into the playoffs at the expense of other teams that everyone's been jerking on since the end of last season, like the Bears and the Giants. Nobody gave you guys a chance, now you can say FUCK YOU to those guys because you made it to the playoffs and they didn't.

Too much BF3 for me, my mouse hand is all twitchy.....LET'S GO VIKES, SKOL!  The Rams are the type of team that gives us fits.  Bleg

Nice sack, so far D is looking p good

Short field, I was going to say something super negative and pessimistic, BUT I'M NOT GONNA DO IT!

I like that play...the pass to Simpson, not so much...scared me

DON'T GET AWAY FROM THE RUN

RUN CHRISTIAN RUN!!!!!!!!!!

Good Lord that run D is stout at the moment.  Peterson HAS to break them

WHOA PONDER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  He needed that, probably more than the team did.  Good work, kid!

Their D will crumble, stay with the run

Someone forgot to practice tacking x 2

UH OH ROBISON'S HAIR IS HURT!!!!  Split ends??!?!  Dunno.  Not good.  Hello Everson, please don't jump offsides everyother play.  It'll be good to see what he does when he plays most downs

Kevin Williams dropping into coverage is funny

Not too bad, defense.  Django Unchained....screw xmas with family

Ponder has, apparently, been lifting and now has some zip on the ball

POUND IT...QUIT THROWING OFF YOUR BACK FOOT WHILE YOU'RE FALLING AWAY, PONDER

Good punt

Ugg tackle ugg TACKLE TACKLE TACKLE

In NFC North news...Mason Crosby remembered he was still Mason Crosby

Booooo fade touchdown....boooo

More NFC North news...Brandon Marshall is still a douche, even though he scored

**YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!**

**ALL DAY ALL DAY ALL DAY ALL DAY ALL DAY ALL DAY ALL DAY**

**SUCK IT, TERRY BRADSHAW, SUCK IT**

Yeah, that was a bad screen...really bad

I'm almost happier when Ponder takes a sack rather than throwing it away badly

Walsh &gt; Zuerlein

Ballard with the accidental tackle

EVERSON IS A BEAST!!!!!!!!!!!  BOOM!  I wonder if he can play wide out...very nice hands

Might kill Bradford today.  Why aren't they running?  It's not like time is an issue.  I'll take it, but wtf

I think Bradford might cry...I would if I were him

And now it's official, Terry Bradshaw is a fucking moron-idiot

And 2 catches for Carlson...this is really weird.  Pretty soon Ponder will have a completion for 50 yards in the air over the middle to Aromashadu

Walsh &gt;&gt; Zuerlein

It looks like it's possible that AD can get 100 more yards in the second half

I know we're way ahead, but let's play some defense, eh?!

As an aside....[I hope we can draft this guy in the first round](http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/players/1785812)

Get it to half

Walsh &gt;&gt;&gt; Zuerlein

I like games like this, it's been a very long time

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's get it to AD A LOT

NFC North Update: Pukers up by 14

sigh...good kick bad coverage...good penalty

Robison's hair is here in spirit, at least

Bad punt, maybe their punter needs to focus on kicking more during his free time

Go Browns, Saints, Falcons, Steelers, and *uggg* Pack!

Michael Jenkins continues to not suck

I wish that THIS Jerome Simpson had been around all year

Not a fumble...not even close.  BS BS.  Aaaaand a stupid pass

Walsh is BY FAR the best rookie kicker

COME ON BROWNS.....rooting for the Browns, even when you're not a fan, hurts

Are we going to play prevent defense the rest of the game?  I know we're not, really, but it feels like it

Crappy penalty, but I'll say it again...AJ isn't terrible

I hate these long drives when it's not the Vikings doing it.  MORE AD DAMMIT...I DEMAND MORE AD

And Mason Crosby just missed his 29th field goal attempt of the game 

Just to be clear, Greenway is NOT great in coverage.  He's average at best.  But when you're an announcer in a blow out it is apparently very important to make up as much BS as you can to pass the time.  It's not like Gus is going to call him out on it.  

Booo Rams BOOOOOO

The things that Peterson is doing are absolutely unreal.  We're going to be spoiled for a long long time because of him.  It's astounding

Alright alright alright...enough bad prevent d

sigh

HOLY CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  

S'ok...Walsh has GOT this

We are witnissing such greatness....Peterson would have 2500 yards if he had gotten the ball more in games 4-8

Finally decided to play defense...nice

Couple more carries for Peterson, what say you?  Guess not :(

And game over!

1375815323.0	1jtuv5	I'm interning with FOX sports for camp, here's my answers to some of your questions so far.	tault002	47	3	53	"The questions came from this thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/minnesotavikings/comments/1ifrlh/im_interning_with_fox_sports_for_the_vikings/

First, questions from /u/antonecott:

1) Sharrif Floyd looks pretty good, although I think it will take some time before he makes any legitimate impact in the regular season.  I don't think work ethic or stamina is an issue, but the rest of the line looks sharp.  I think he'll definitely make the smallest impact out of the 3 first rounders.

2) Ponder looks iffy so far.  There's a mix of solid throws and poor decisions.  He definitely hasn't regressed but he doesn't look he's made any serious strides.  Time will tell, but in my opinion, I'll be surprised if he's the starting quarterback next year.

3) Jennings is the clear cut number one receiving option.  He looks great, albeit a bit disinterested.  Simpson and Wright both look decently strong, and Patterson is a freak who needs some polish.  Some of CP's route running can get sloppy, but if he gets space, he's dangerous.  The receiving options will definitely be there for Ponder, so if the passing game struggles this year, it's on him.

4) Regarding Joe Webb as a defensive back, I don't think they're trying him out because his build and speed doesn't really fit the position.  He doesn't have the quickness to keep up with wide receivers.  That said, I think he's looked pretty good offensively.  He's a big target and his hands are definitely there, plus he hasn't had too much trouble creating space.  He could become a legitimate contributor.

5) I think Erin Henderson has looked tremendous so far.  During the draft I was skeptical on them passing up early chances to take a MLB, but it looks like they knew what they were doing in handing Henderson the keys.  He's repeatedly making plays every day.

Harrison Smith also looks great, and I think Xavier Rhodes will be the best of the 3 first rounders this year.  Patterson could be good, but I think Rhodes can step in right away.

6) I think the linebackers will be alright.  As I said, Henderson looks really good, but the Bishop injury makes it difficult to judge him.  I think the defense will be solid all around this year.

7)  There are a couple rookies working in with the linemen, but they haven't made too many waves.  I wouldn't expect to see new faces getting any significant playing time there.

8) The players all seem really high on Harrison Smith, Henderson, and Cordarrelle.  All 3 of them get mentioned by the players frequently for their play.

9) The London game hasn't really been brought up yet, I don't know if they're really thinking that far ahead.

10) Special teams coordinator Mike Priefer and defensive line coach Brendan Daly both have really stood out from a coaching standpoint.  I think Jeff Locke will more than fill in Kluwe's shoes as both a punter and a holder for Walsh, which means Priefer will have brought in replacements to upgrade kicker and punter in consecutive years.  He's a terrific coach, I think he'll be heading to larger roles in the near future.

Daly just brings an energy that commands your attention.  The defensive line all really respect him and pay attention to what he's saying.  His passion is exciting.



For /u/Stonedude22, I think Patterson will be used in a manner similar to the way they used Harvin, although not as frequently.  They've been getting him involved with bubble screens and reverses, while also taking some shots downfield.  He can get involved in a lot of different ways.  He's also the number one option at kick return as of right now.

For /u/SurlyMike, the overall team dynamic seems pretty positive.  They all seem to have bought into the team's success this year and have made it clear they expect big things.  Personally, I have serious doubts about how far Ponder can take them, but I think AD and their defense should get them to right around where they were last year.  If I had to make a prediction I'd say wildcard playoff birth or the first team to miss the cut.

For /u/whatsthasitch
-Not sure what Peterson eats for breakfast, though I assume he's already full from feasting on the nightmares of opposing linebackers
-I think Patterson or Wright will hold the #2 receiver spot.  Probably more clear cut Patterson as the year progresses
-Samantha Steele has made a few appearances, and I've gotten to talk to her a couple times.  As expected, she is magnificent.
-DC Alan Williams seemed doubtful of a Floyd/Williams pairing but you never know.  I think if Floyd shows a lot of improvement during the season anything can happen.  The first preseason game will show a lot.

AD was the reason I started watching football, and he's the reason I'm a Vikings fan. I've always loved watching him run. It kills me that he's injured, it's like watching my hero fall. I'll always see him as the best RB that ever played, regardless of things to come or legends of old. I hope he comes back strong, which hopefully isn't a long shot, after all, he's basically made of steel.

Stay strong and recover fast man. I'll be watching. "	t5_2qocl	True

1375980670.0	1jyrir	This season is unlike any other I've anticipated for...	ygrn	54	13	44	"Been a Vikes fan for a long time and honestly I can't remember going into a season as a fan feeling like this... I know our team isn't at true superbowl contender status yet but this season has a lot of potential that could surprise a lot of people yet again. 

I was pumped for last season and I was even more thrilled with the season and how it ended. Our team is better in every way now and I just can't wait to see what happens.

Anyway how excited are y'all? Do predictions if you want but I'm saying 11 wins this season. I 'called' a 10 win season last year (mostly because I'm a huge fucking homer) and I was spot on somehow. I can't help but think we'll improve by 1 win with the changes we made. Could be more but our schedule is definitley tougher (it was tough as hell last season too, we just lack 1 home game now). 


It's all contingent on Ponder, sorry for using that cliche again. He lit it up at certain parts of the season and if he can just not turn the ball over we have a serious force in the NFC. I believe the Vikings were undefeated last season if they won the turnover differential. I think we got a better secondary and hopefully a smarter Ponder to help keep that stat in check.

The icing on the cake for this season is that the expectations for this club around the league is LOW. Nobody talks about this team ever. And that's perfect. It can make the rebuilding years go a lot more smoothly in the coming years.

tl;dr - omg skoll cnt wait for the season lyk dis if u cry evertim thinking about how sweet the season is gon' be"	t5_2qocl	True

Vikings would be 7 - 4, 3 - 0 division, and 5-3 in the conference.

Next tie breaker is common games.  We both would have beat Cards, Lions, Jags, and Bears and lost to the Seahawks and the Colts.  However, Vikings beat the 49ers while GB lost to them, resulting in Vikings being #1 in NFC North!

&gt;**The numbers:**

&gt;**Manning**

&gt;* leads all qualified quarterbacks with an 84.8 Total QBR
*  top-5 in most major passing categories, including: touchdowns (21), yards (2,705) completion percentage (69.7) and yards per attempt (8.2). 
 *  He and Matt Ryan are the only quarterbacks who are in the top-5 in all four categories. 
* has 16 plays of 30 or more yards
*  throwing a touchdown pass every 15.7 attempts
*  posting a 3.5 touchdown to interception ratio

&gt;**Peterson**

&gt;* 112.8 yards rushing per game
* 5.8 yards per carry 
* averaged 2.8 yards per rush AFTER first contact.
* 6.3 yards per carry when defenders put at least eight men in the box
* has faced eight or more defenders in the box on a league-high 57 rushes this season
* has gained 20-plus yards on 13 runs this season
 * almost twice as many as the next rusher

**My Thoughts**

Personally I think its close. Both players came back from debilitating injuries, that should have either ended their career or drastically reduced their production. However I have to give Peterson the edge in the sense of personal and strength of schedule. Manning is benefiting from playing on a playoff caliber team. A team that made the playoffs in spite of having Tebow at the helm... not to mention they play in arguably the weakest division in the NFL. The broncos also have a stellar running game, to keep defenses honest.

Peterson on the other hand is having his way with defenses who are crowding the box to stop him (as per the usual). He is leading a team that only managed to win 3 games last season, and is playing at a MVP caliber level while playing with a passing game that ranks 29th in the NFL

Berrian is out, so we'll win then right?  Isn't that the pattern??

1. **I FUCKING LOVE YOU CHRIS PONDER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

2. OMG I LOVE YOU HAVE MY MAN BABIES!!

3. AND WE HAVE THROWBACKS ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I SENSE AN ALL CAPSLOCK POST FROM ME TODAY!!!!!!!!!!!

4. Dammit that it wasn't a TD.  Lets smash it in

5. Just awesome...just fucking awesome!

6. Now let's see if the D can hold up

7. I hate our pass defense against tight ends.

8. Need lots and lots and lots of JA and BROBB.  I hate Ryan Grant.  Ugg.  And still pissed at Cook...I can't really express how pleased I had been with his play the last couple weeks.  This sucks.

9. Need line pressure or we'll get slaughtered

10. If we can hold them to a FG we should all rejoice

11. The key to limiting them is tackling after the catch.  That's going to be the true test

12. FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF.  Allen had him.  0.5 more seconds.  Ufff.

13. I think that we need our D-Line to hit Rodgers hard and often.  He can be rattled.

14. More Ponder = more happiness.  Let's go O!

15. Clay Aiken needs to cut his hair

16. **HOLY SHIT A QB WHO DIDN'T THROW IT AT THE RECEIVER'S  FEET!!!!!!**

17. That usually does well.....

18. Arrggg Booker, catch that dammit

19. Kluwe time.  Have you seen him getting on Peter King on twitter??  Good stuff

20. Jesus.....

21. Good tackle JA

22. **AND A HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE SACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**  We need that.  A lot of that

23. WTF Penalty.  No more please

24. That was a risky pass....lucky too

25. Percy up the middle!  That's new....not bad either

26. I don't like those throws at all.  Too soft and not enough separation by the receiver

27. WOOOHOOO WE GET IT BACK!!!!!!!!!  OK...let's see some AD pounding and *good* play action stuff

28. That was sweet.  Wow that was a good run and decent blocking off the line.

29. Nice little run.  3rd down conversions killed us during the McNabb era...let do better.  YAY!

30. THIS IS AWESOME!!!!!!!  ACCURACY IS FUCKING FANTASTIC!

31. TD.  Guion as an upback is fun

32. what.  the.  fuck.  :(

33. How about Rodgers throwing an incompletion soon 

34. Nice stop BRobb.  He needs a haircut too.

35. Vomit vomit vomit.  I don't even know if you can do anything about this.  I hate the dude, but Rodgers is unreal.  Need more pressure

36. That ball was uncatchable btw.  Damn

37. Double Finley plaese.  Again, a FG is a win at this point

38. Jared Allen is a man amongst men.  

39. Perfect time for your first incompletion!  Watch for the fake.  

40. Ok guys...calm down and quit kicking the fat Packers dude in the balls BRobb.  Not needed at this point, later perhaps it will be, but not now

41. Just off on that throw.  Should have been caught but Aromoshadu should have been ready

42. Another 3rd down conversion.  This is simply amazing

43. And that was against a couple blitzes.  McNabb would have held the ball and blah blah blah...know what, I'm going to move on.  Simply put, this is the best the offense has looked all year.  It's just sharper.  I'm glad

44. First down again!!!!!  This shit did not happen before.  And on target passes are so awesome.  I'm trying to move on, but I can't yet.  

45. THERE YOU GO AD!!!!!  I like the space between the first and second levels

46. OOoooOoOooOOoooo caught from behind.   Don't let it happen again Chris

47. Passing to Aromashadu seems a little scary at this point.  Go Ryan.  And it's good!  That was a great great nice long time consuming drive.  When have we had one of those recently?  

48. Should it bother me that Webb and Ponder are the only Qbs meeting with the coaches in those camera shots?  

49. Need more pressure up the middle

50. Bad time for that LeTroy.  :(  Plus with the penalty they didn't have to use a time out.  Come on guys.  Keep your focus

51. We need one, maybe 2 stops.  Come on D!

52. Great great great first half Purple!  Keep it focused and keep it up.

HALFTIME

1. Let's keep up the pressure on Rodgers

2. Oh dammit dammit dammit...............ugg.  How does that happen?  

3. We need new safties.  Here's the order of need for drafting.  O-Line &gt; Safeties &gt; O-Line &gt; CB &gt; O-Line &gt;D-Line

4. Damn not quite.  3 and outs aren't good.  Let's get some bigtime D.  Could have used some bigtime special teams...........................

5. Ohhh shit almost had him

6. **YOU HAVE GOT TO MAKE THOSE TACKLES**

7. ..............................................

8. Refocus and march down the field.  We don't need to score all at once or right away.  We just need some big long drives and some patience.

9. AD should not get tackled like that.  And that was strange by Ponder

10. I'm pretty sure we need to never throw it to Aromashadu ever again.  He had one good game.  And most of that was luck.  Ex-Bears WRs need to go

11. Bad decision Ponder.  You're a rookie so we'll forgive you.  But that was a bad bad decision and not a great throw.    

12. Maybe the D can do something.  Maybe

13. BULLSHIT.  That is not catchable....BULL SHIT 

14. nice stop...nice stop

15. Again, this game is still within reach, BUT we don't need to try to get it all back all at once.  Just a nice long drive.  

16. He seems more nervous now than when the game started

17. NEED TO THROW THE BALL HARDER!!!!I think McNabb is telling Ponder that it's impossible to throw ints if you ""corrctly"" throw the ball at your receiver's feet 

18. Nice sack Griffen

19.  Wow....just wow.  OK ok ok ok.  

20. The rest of the game is just experience for Ponder.  Let's see it.  GO

21. There is **NO QUIT** in AD.  So good

22. How does Clay Aiken not get blocked?

23. I don't understand what they are doing.....

24. I wonder if the D can get a stop.  It would be pretty cool if they did

25. I'm happy about that stop.  I wonder if Ponder knows, or if we have, a hurry up/no huddle offense

26. Really don't want that penalty.  Was it on Asher?  I hate our CBs

27. Big big conversion.  Risky throw, but it worked.  These downfield shots are not good.  What the hell are the receivers doing?

28. Another one.  Keep it going!

29. And a shitty penalty :(

30. Nice throw and catch.  I like Camrillo.  Need more of him.  And a penalty on **THEM**  woohoo!

31. **WWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!**  That was **AWESOME!!!!!!!**

32. When he has the chance to play loose he's pretty good.  Need some HUGE defense

33. Alright....COME ON

34. **GET A STOP RIGHT HERE**

35. GOOD GOOD GOOD!

36. Holy shit that wasn't good.  At all.  Long way to go, but we can do it.

37. Please don't pass it to Aromashadu ever again....Shaincoe is fine.  First Down!

38. Smart throwing it away.  AD isn't right.  TobyG please

39. CAMIRRILO AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!  WHERE HAS HE BEEN AL FUCKING YEAR???!!?!? BENCHED FOR THAT IDIOT BERRIAN IS WHERE

40. DAMMIT!!!!!  

41.  Let's go D.  I don't like that call AT ALL

42. Uggg....uggg....ugggg.....ugggg

43. That was a helpful penalty.  I hope we get at least one chance on offense

44. Fuck

45.  Good game though...really it was.  I like what Ponder did for the most part.  With more practice and more experience we might have something here.  Today was the most fun I have had since game 1.  Even moreso than the win against the Cards.  It seems like there is now something to look forward to

Keep in mind, the Packers are a good good team.  We played well.  You all be safe this evening.  Don't beat up people and end up in jail :(

Let me say something...if you are dependent on other teams' cast-offs you wade around in mediocrity. Look at the Redskins before this year, or the Eagles, or Cowboys, or Whoever....  

Look at the Super Bowl winners over the last decade...name the bigtime free agents on the Giants, Steelers, Pack (Woodson that's it), Colts, etc. the Saints had a few but that's it. In this age of free agency you're screwed if you're building your team with players that aren't deemed worthy enough by their original team to keep around. 

So all these trouble cases and has-beens aren't going to fix what's wrong here. We're in this mess because our previous coach refused to address the long-term qb situation through the draft once everyone and their mother realized TJax sucked. It is of paramount importance to develop your own talent through the draft and undrafted free agents, not a bunch of ""can't miss"" vets. Rebuilding sucks hard, but it has to be done the right way. We're better off than a lot of teams who have been worse than us for longer than us. I'd propose that's precisely because we have started the approach of building this team the right way from the ground up

Lastly, when teams feel they're one player away from greatness and reach for someone that they feel can help them win now you end up with Herschel Walker and no Super Bowls.

That flag on Robinson is straight BS

haha Simpson!  Where is Rudolph

KEEP KICKING OFF TO US!!!!!!!!!!

D needs to refocus

Maybe Stafford should quit wearing his hat backwards like Romo does, and maybe he'll quit playing like him...

So we quit running when we're averaging ~7 yards per attempt...fucking genius

Ponder singlehandedly broke Avril's ankle

In a horrible memory call-back, I'm glad Walsh missed one

ouch Greenway...ouch

But I am writing this due to a recent lynching I suffered from the ""CheeseBears"" community. I posted a comment in a thread yesterday entitled something near A Packer's Guide to Hating the Vikings. Out of this article I took some statistics: The divisional wins in the North/Central go as follows: Vikings, 18; Packers, 11; Bears, 10. Here was my comment (downvoted to Reddit Hell):

""I love how we are the historical powerhouses of the North/Central... This is probably why the Packers-Bears rivalry is ""more intense."" They are so used to fighting for second place that it is a permanent competition...

Edit: North/Central

Edit: Clearly the cheesebears have arrived

Edit: I posted in /r/MinnesotaVikings so if you don't like it, stay out of that subreddit""

[Here is the Link to the Downvoting Hell](http://www.reddit.com/r/minnesotavikings/comments/1ic16d/a_packers_fans_guide_to_hating_the_vikings_i_love/cb39goi)

Yeah, yeah, a simple joke emphasizing the greater rivalry between the Packers and the Bears (offering an alternative explanation from the obvious [or what I thought to be obvious] point that they have been around since the beginning), but the issue is that the comment was linked to /r/GreenBayPackers for sure (I don't know about the Bears subreddit because FUCK THE BEARS) and was downvoted under the impression that it was made because of our 2012 season ALONE. So being the asshole that I am, I thought I might go dig up some statistics detailing some very key TEAM achievements since the NFL merger (a fair sample size in my opinion). I figured the merger should be where most statistics really start to count because I feel that prior to that, football was truly in its primitive form. Another reason to go from the merger is that the Vikings are a younger team when compared to Green Bay and Chicago, so it was a good base point where all franchises were up and running at the same time. This is not to say that it hasn't grown leaps and bounds since then, but here goes anyways:

**Since the NFL merger:**

*the Packers have won ~363 games and lost ~324*

*the Bears have won ~345 games and lost ~341*

*the Lions have won ~269 games and lost ~402*

*the Vikings have won ~386 games and lost ~305*

*these include postseason games

**Number of Winning seasons:**

Packers: *21*

Bears: *18*

Lions: *12*

Vikings: *26*

**Playoff Appearances:**

Packers: *17*

Bears: *14*

Lions: *10*

Vikings: *25*

**Playoff Wins:**

Packers: *16*

Bears: *10*

Lions: *1*

Vikings: *17*

**Superbowl Appearances/Wins:**

Packers: *3/2*

Bears: *2/1*

Lions: *0/0*

Vikings: *3/0*

Some of these statistics may be off a little, so take them with a grain of salt. Even so, it is strikingly clear who the ""powerhouses of the North/Central"" truly are (outside of Superbowl wins).

I encourage you to correct my stats if you know they are wrong, and to add in other team stats for me to add to the list. I want to KNOW if I wrongly labeled us as the historical powerhouses of the North/Central, even if it was just as a joke in the beginning.

1366682790.0	1cwozs	Woe is the Vikings if they select Te'o - Alternative LB options.		44	6	72	"Let's start with Te'o:

I really do not believe he will be a productive NFL player. He had a statistically productive senior campaign but the most impressive part of his season - his seven interceptions - is really unreliable. Interceptions are highly variable and a lot of the picks he had this season were the result of tipped balls at the line of scrimmage. He's also not a thumper; he's not one of those guys who will stick a running back and stop him in his tracks. He's a grab-and-drag tackler and that doesn't work as well at the next level. He's got second round value but most definitely should not be taken with either the 23rd or 25th picks.

So, what are our first round options?

Alec Ogletree: An obvious choice - widely considered the best ILB prospect in the draft

Arthur Brown: Again, obvious choice. He's become one of the fan favorites for his athleticism and nose for the ball and I love his intangibles as well. 

Kevin Minter: I'm torn on Minter. The guy can hit, and he improved on his 40 time when he ran a 4.67 at his pro day, but his hips are tight in coverage and I worry he may not be able to handle the responsibilities that come with playing MLB in the Tampa 2.

If we happen to miss on these guys another Linebacker I love that should be available at the end of the second round is Sio Moore out of UConn. Moore is awesomely athletic, running a 4.62 40 and completing 29 bench reps at the combine. He lined up all over the field for the huskies, playing inside and outside linebacker in both a 4-3 and a 3-4, showcasing his versatility and ability to grasp the responsibilities of multiple positions at a time - a trait that's hugely important for a middle linebacker. He's far from a perfect prospect and sometimes looks uncomfortable operating in space, but I think he'd be an interesting option if we were to miss out on Ogletree, Brown and Minter.

No matter how bad it looks, I have optimism. Even in the worst years, I watch all of the good signs, the good moves, emerging players, and look forward to a good draft pick. 
That said this year I am out of my mind with optimism. I base that in a few things. 
A. It remains to be seen, but I believe that we have had our second stellar draft in a row.
B. we have a core of great talent.
C. I don't see Ponder as a lost cause. If he develops at all, and if there is true improvement in our recieving corp, we could be Superbowl bound. Admittedly these are big ifs. But it is not unreasonable to expect a QB to take a couple years to develop, and that he would need a good recieving corp.
D. Of you follow the media hype, these people are good at predicting the good teams before the season. They are hedging their bets on the Vikings. No one is predicting a Superbowl season, but they are keeping an eye on Minnesota. This season could go either way, but the potential is their, and big money knows it."	t5_2qocl	True

So this week I ate a lucky spicyashell pepper for good luck...we'll see

**PERCY HARVIN**  Oh hell...oh hell...

How about we calm down and stop taking bad penalties

Lucky lucky lucky so far.  LUCKY

Please give me more AD please please please Mr Bill...more more more.  RUN THE BALL ALL DAY!!!  And that's what Simpson brings, just a reminder.  That's awesome!!!!

WOOOOOOHOOOOO EARLY LEAD!!!  I &lt;3 AD

I guess we forgot how to tackle when we forgot how to play penalty free football...Harrison Smith is awesome and announcer dude guy, he wasn't drafted #1

Greenway in man coverage makes me sad

GOOD GOD WE NEED ANOTHER PAT WILLIAMS

WOOTS FUMBLE WOOT!

Oh LORD...Look, I love Ponder, but why not just feed the RBs the ball for a long long time

So, this is a fairly important drive.  We need to keep our D off the field for a bit....so, how about, run the ball a bit, and don't pass so much

Here's the thing, at least I think this is right...they can't stop us from doing what we do well, BUT they can stop us from doing the things we're not so good at, so why the hell do we get away from our strengths???!?!

THIS IS WHY WE CAN'T HAVE NICE THINGS, BURTON!

Harvin saves the day!  The man is amazing...and that drive was pretty nice.

And a nice defensive sequence.  I really miss Pat Williams.  Enough penalties...en - nough

I wonder if we'll try to score or just kill the clock.  All in all not an awful first half.  Except for that.  WTF PONDER, throw the ball away you nimwit.  What horrible decision-making on those ints...horrible horrible.  

We are so f-ing lucky.  It's not even funny.  Someone might need to slap Ponder a few times at halftime.  So lucky

**I LOVE YOU HARRISON I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!**  ^^^nohomo  It's been a while since we've seen that.  Seems like forever

Ok D, quit stroking yourselves, it's time to play football again and TACKLE.  Defense is asleep now.  They did one amazing thing and then naptime apparently.  So, by my unofficial count, the Vikings have a bazillion penalties for approximately 76 gigafazillion yards...good christ

That #26 guy is pretty damn good

Didn't douchebag color guy say he liked the idea of going for it when they were, and now he doesn't?  Anyway AD AD AD AD AD AD AD AD AD AD AD MORE **MOAR!!**

Hey hey hey Ponder threw it away

**I'VE GOT AN IDEA!!!!  PETERSON IS SHREDDING THE DEFENSE SO LET'S TAKE HIM OUT OF THE GAME!!!  SO WE CAN GET KLUWE ON THE FIELD OBVIOUSLY.**  I know we're winning, but holy crap this is borderline incompetent. 

""Jarred Allen with his fifth sack of the season and his fifth game in a row with ***at least*** a sack"" - Best quote of the day

I'm not even sure what I just watched on that last sequence

I want nachos...badly

We are doing just about everything we can to let the Cards make this game more interesting.  Thanks goodness the D is playing well 75% of the time, and the Cardinals' offensive line is TERRIBE or we would be getting our asses kicked.   

Did we inactivate Simpson at halftime???????????????????

Ponder has something wrong with his brain right now...this is the worst game he's played all year.  I hope he shakes it off because I have the feeling we're going to need him still

Anyone else just let out a HUGE sigh of relief?  Because, yeah....

BTW,  Tim Ryan and Chris Meyers are absolutely terrible

The Cards have a really good defense, supposedly, but THIS IS TERRIBLE

Oh boy...oh boy

And our defense is gassed....**WHEW**

1347297223.0	znt0n	In honour of Chris Kluwe, I've decided to try to give a damn about the NFL this year. Can I get some help? (x-post from /r/NFL)	Baron_Wobblyhorse	37	7	57	"To clarify, I enjoy watching football (I've traditionally been a CFL fan) but the only sport I actually follow is hockey, so I'm coming in pretty blind to NFL fan-dom. I tried this 'let's like the NFL for a year' experiment once before, but your season is just so damn short that I felt like I missed it without even noticing.

My cousin is a pretty big football fan, so he's helped me out a little (when games are, etc) but apart from subscribing here (done and done) is there anywhere else I should be checking to keep up to date with stuff.

As the title suggests, my interest in the NFL was sparked in part by Kluwe being both awesome and hilarious, so I've decided to be a Vikings' fan this year (with the apparent added bonus that I'll be a fan of the rival team to my cousins' beloved Green Bay Packers), so anything I need to know about the team? Who to watch, names to look out for, anybody of note injured or in peril? Up and coming stars?

I don't have regular TV service, so I was also wondering if games are streamed anywhere.

Anything else you can offer a rookie NFL fan-in-training would be appreciated.

Cheers!

**LET'S GO!!!!!!!!!!!**

The D needs to help out and get quick stops so Peterson gets the ball as much as possible....I SAID HELP NOT GET DUMB PENALTIES!@

I'm nervous and anxious...way to start the game offense :(

Hey, AD is p good!  Rudolph looks so freaking slow when he gets moving

Michael Jenkins continues to not suck...that was a really pretty pass and catch

RUDOLPH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  That was an amazing and incredible drive.  I'm not sure what to think

PONDER'S ISSUE HAS BEEN DISCOVERED AND REMEDIED...HE NEEDED TO GET LAID WITHOUT RELIGIOUS GUILT

FYI: The Texans are like us, AWFUL at playing from behind

Wright does well with that, he's not Harvin, but.....

Not enough AD

Whoa Griffin

AJ AJ AJ YES!!!

Michael Jenkins doesn't suck

I now wish that Ponder had married sex before the season started

In Walsh we trust

Smith almost had that...the D looks incredible so far today

**PLAYOFF SCORE ALERT:  THE SAINTS NEED TO QUIT SCREWING US AND TAKE CARE OF THE COWBOYS...14-7 COWBOYS....ALSO, BESIDES THE PACKERS THOSE ARE MY TWO LEAST FAVORITE TEAMS YUCK**

IDGAF Keep feeding AD please

Simpson needs to catch that

I love it when Ponder runs....he can and should do it more

blech...yuck...blag

This game is going by incredibly quickly  **AND WHERE IS COREYF??**  If he shows up make him go away again, we're doing well and we don't need him to jinx it

Great return sets us up nicely

I'm not kidding at all...Ponder needed to get married 8 months ago.  This is night and day, and Houston's pass D isn't terrible

And Everson is playing really well...like, really really really well.  Consistently

**SAINTS TIE IT UP**

---------------------------------------------

AD will go for 160 in the second half, guaranteed

Keep feeding AD and teach Simpson how to block

Nice drive again, just keep feeding him

Also, it DOES help when you throw it past the first down marker on 3rd and long

**PLAYOFF UPDATE: THE TITANS SUCK**

Greenway can tackle better - should tackle better

FFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU PONDER

Stout D, and Griffin is playing like a BEAST

Someone needs to make AD angry, he's not playing angry

HUGE PENALTY

&gt;Also, it DOES help when you throw it past the first down marker on 3rd and long

sigh

Ugggggggggggggggggggggggggg

WHAT A STAND!

MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE DAMMIT

Simpson made a really good play!

FEED THE BEAST

Uffffff da

Offense needs to do just a little more, and get Peterson just a few more yards

I'm getting anxious again

**SAINTS GO UP!**

Why are we not running up the middle?

PONDER WITH THE WHEELS

**TOBYG BACK FROM THE DEAD!!!!**

FREE TOBYG

Wright is good too

**TTTTTTTTTTOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOBBBBBBBBBBBBBYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!**

I hope Peterson gets a chance for a few more yards

BOOM

Great great great game.  Peterson can still get the record, it'll take a lot, but he can do it.  More importantly we are alive in the playoff race and might be in control of our own destiny after the day is over.  How amazing this year has been.

Seriously, AD better get the ball at least 37 times

I hate Cobb.  LET'S RUIN RODGERS' BIRTHDAY

I DO like Josh Robinson, and that was a stupid penalty.  Not going to win despite dumbness today.  Close, if we keep getting penetration like that we might do good things.  But we need to tackle

I'm going to say this one more time and that's it....WE ARE NOT GOING TO WIN IF WE PLAY STUPIDLY, PERIOD, THE END.

Pretty good coverage by Jefferson, it was a really good catch.

No need to panic, and this should be a point of emphasis too, we need to stick with what we're good at and keep doing it, no matter what the scoreboard says

FEED THE BEAST

Wright was WIDE open....sigh.  I hate how fast those 3 and outs seem.  Maybe we need to screw around more or something, just to take a little extra time

So close...so freaking close

Big stop time!!!!!  Are we going to jump offside on EVERY SINGLE 3rd DOWN???  GOOD GOD.  Oh hey, the Packers made a mistake!  Sheesh, relying on penalties to slow a drive down is total crap.  The D needs to step it up.

Good stop.  Now Crosby can miss and we'll be ok.  FFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU

Keep doing this stuff...what we're doing now.  Please.

Nice little play there.  I liked that.  Simpson needs to block downfield better x 2

Good drive.  **BOOM BOOM BOOM**  Nice work!!!!!!!!!

Need some good defense here.  AND A STOP!  please punt it.  Ok whew, that was great and let's do that ""drive and score"" thing again.  More AD and more Rudolph and pepper some Wright in there 

A) umm flag??? B) Aromashadu???  3) Ugg.  

Brinkley is the President of the Can't Tackle For Shit club.  ENOUGH OFFSIDES  ENOUGH ENOUGH ENOUGH.  Whew wow whew and Allen COME ON MAN!

OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**WOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO**

ALLEN WITH THE PICK!!!  And crap.....  That was a TERRIBLE call.  Holy shit that was awful.  AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL WHAT THE HELL

Give me a GOD DAMN break.  Horseshit bullshit garbage.  Sorry for the cursing but holy crap that was awful.  A score before the half would be huge.  That call, man...that call

Bad pass no time

Nice return Cobb

Hold them.  Boooooo.  Got to get to Rodgers better.  We're 6 inches and a quarter of a second away.  Frustrating 

Oh boy.  I hate this offsides day.  No good and GOOD HALF!!!!  Keep pounding them and punching them in the face.  Don't let up  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Take care of the ball

Mason Crosby is having a very bad day, a very bad month really.  AND Les is right, these penalties are STU................HOLY SHIT AD!!!!!!!!!

**AD AD AD!**  Someone buy that man a steak and let him sleep in, who cares

Dammit Christian.   Too easy and awful.  BAD BAD QB BAD

Defense please bail us out

So freaking close every stinking time.  Nice tackle, Green Bay line.  Not really allowed

For the love of all that's good, don't let them score.  Points off turnovers make me sad

Crosby time??  Or not.  They hate him.  STOP EM

The crappy Fox robot has a twitter account???  Hysterical.

Oh hey, Crosby made two now, that means the rest of the way he's going to miss

Please stop throwing to Simpson x 2...Jesus.  Why no passes towards Wright?  Who, Ponder or Musgrave, feels the need to involve Simpson AT ALL?  You had your best drive of the day throwing to Rudolph, where are the designed throws to him?  I'm starting to have some bad feelings about this

INTERCEPTION BY SMITH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I feel some relief.  Crap.  Needed to convert there.  We can not keep letting them hang around.  A WR screen to Wright here and there would be freaking awesome.  Or a little flair to him.  Or how about a screen pass.  Anything

And seriously **I MISS PAT WILLIAMS**

I guess these previously horrible GB running backs are suddenly Emmit Smith.  This game is RIDICULOUS

Offsides.  Do we need a little luck?  We might

That was a good playcall and a not great pass.  Someone else might have caught it, but oh well.  ponder converts the 3rd down.  Ok fine

All Day, baby...All stinking Day!

Another lucky call.  I'll take it.  These refs are something else.  Ponder needs to be better.  This is getting inexcusable.  And there you go.  Wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow.  This is, like, the perfect storm of bad qb play and predictability and just general crap

Time to take Ponder out and sit him down.  That's it.  He NEEDS to be done for the week.  Period.  If you want to win THIS WEEK he should sit.  I know that Ponder has an incredibly long leash, but if he's so mentally fragile that being benched is going to ruin him, then he isn't the answer at that position.  SIT HIM DOWN

So bad...so so bad.  We should be crushing them

What the hell

Well....I'm pretty speechless

What you got?

Why, oh why, is Ponder still in there?  How can any of our other options be worse than this?  Seriously

Lucky that wasn't picked.  Are we going to get Ocho this week?  

**OH LOOK, CHRISTIAN, YOU STAY IN THE POCKET AND SET YOUR FEET AND YOU CAN ZIP THE BALL IN FOR A COMPLETION!**

Kick the FG

Miss...and there goes the game.  Not that there was much chance anyway, but damn :(

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK, so here goes my 2 cents...

A good wr will help us, but only so much.  Even if we had Moss in his prime, we're not winning a game with QB play like we had today.  And if Ponder's confidence is so fragile that he can't handle being benched when he's playing like shit, them he isn't the QB I hoped he would be.  

I've been a huge supporter of his since we drafted him.  But he has gotten worse and worse and worse.  He's had one good game since week 5.  ONE.  And I know that we're rebuilding this year and so far we have exceeded expectations, but when you have a shot to go to the playoffs and you don't take it??!?!?!

Awful

Also, I really do think that Ponder needs to just go out there and play.  Sometimes being super smart is a hindrance.  He's thinking too much and being indecisive.  The coaches should try to help him with that.  But, seriously, this is some awful awful qb play "	t5_2qocl	True

I like CeeLo but this open has got to be the worst thing on TV...worse than HoneyBooBoo wtf ever that is

BE RIGHT BACK...Ponder needs to calm down...bigtime calm calm calm.  Also, I know the Bucs are good against the run, but COME ON

I hope the D remembers how to tackle, and stuff.  Good first sequence for the D.

So...gotta make them pay on those blitzes....AND DAMMIT KLUWE!

I miss Pat Williams.

I'd like to see A LOT of Toby G tonight.  And a nice really long time consuming drive.  Ponder needs to slow it down a tad

I'm 95% done with Loadholdt...not kidding

This is BAD BAD BAD offense

**FUMBLE FUMBLE FUMBLE** Bah booo

Jeez...well...umm...let's do that hurry up quick offense thing that works kinda well for us.  Don't let Ponder overthink stuff, just go zip it around.  If we have another crap series I might lose my calm collected demeanor.

How about a stop?!?!  Is that too much to ask??  I wish BRob would have caught that......

Ok whew.  Watch for the fake!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Now, 2 scores down, NBD.  Lots of runs and lots of play action and lots and lots of runs.  And a bubble screen to Percy.  And a flea flicker.

THERE IS THE BUBBLE SCREEN!!!!!!!!!!  I should be an offensive coordinator!!!  AND A RUN!!  AND A ROUGHING THE PASSER!  ^^I ^^should ^^have ^^called ^^that

I don't care that AD lost a yard...GIVE HIM THE BALL.  Nevermind.  The fade works!!

**TOUCHDOWN WOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!**  Why can't our playcalling be like that always?!?!?!?!

ROBISON'S HAIR BLOCKS ANOTHER PASS AND THERE WE GO!  Nice series D

Duuuuude Simpson needs to catch that

Someone maybe told the offense that there was a real live football game tonight

sigh

Just deflating.  Get back up.  Ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok

FFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU....2 scores again.  Strap it up and let's go down the field

KYLE!  That was a nice nice play.  All of it.  And well...Simpson earns his keep FOR NOW

Go for it or Walsh?  Walsh it is.  How about a nice take-away...pick 6 would be AWESOME

------------------------------------
Halftime and time to come back BOOM!

----------------------

Better run D, no turnovers and we win...it's that simple

Robison's hair!!!!!

WTF is going on??  This is ridiculous

My brain is about to explode.  I'll...umm....ufff.  This is by far without a doubt the WORST run defense we've had in 10+ years.  And they played really good run D for the first 4 games.  I don't understand one bit

They needed that pick.  Damn

THAT IS A NICE START!!!!  ALL DAY LEADING THE COMEBACK!

Now...defense needs to tackle the running back guy and we'll get the ball back quickly.  LOTS OF TIME, PEOPLE

GOOD SERIES!!!  SEE HOW TACKLING PEOPLE DOES GOOD THINGS FOR YOU??!?!?!

extend the drive, please please please

**UH OH!!**  ALLEN IS PISSED OFF!!!!  YOU WOKE THE BEAST, THIS WILL NOT END WELL FOR YOU!

**OH YEAH YOU MOTHERFUCKER OH FUCK YEAH!!!**

Now....the offense needs to do something good.  That was TERRIBLE.  I swear to GOD if the offense could do ANYTHING at this point we will win this game

ANYTHING

DO SOMETHING SPECIAL DEFENSE!

................................................................

Hate this...so much

Turnovers and terrible offense, this is as bad or possibly worse than Childress's offense.  Absolutely awful

I hope we're never the favorites again the rest of the year.  We'll go undefeated if we aren't.  AND if we lose this game and have the identical record in the second half of the season, we'll be 10-6.  Which is fine

1351171532.0	122bhv	Are the surprising Vikings for real? (ESPN Insider)	frownifdown	38	8	45	"[Here is the article](http://insider.espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8547347/nfl-surprising-minnesota-vikings-real-contenders)

When I watched film of the Minnesota Vikings in the offseason, I thought their proverbial window had closed. With aging players on the downsides of their careers, it looked like a team with a major rebuilding job in front of it. Well, at least to this point of the season, the Vikings have surprised a lot of people with a 5-2 record. Now we are all asking ourselves if they are for real or just a nice little early-season story that will fade into the sunset. Let's examine six areas of this team to see if it can sustain its early success as the season moves forward.

1. Pass offense

This is a passing game with limited weapons. The Vikings have a young quarterback who was good early but has come back to reality in recent weeks. They may have the most conservative play calling of any pass offense in the NFL. No coaching staff asks less of its quarterback, in terms of big plays, and yet Christian Ponder has really been mistake-prone in the past three games.


In all fairness, however, his offensive weapons are limited. While Percy Harvin is the most dynamic offensive player in the NFL right now, he is pretty much the extent of the passing game's threats. Harvin is operating at wide receiver, out of the slot and even at running back, but almost all of his receptions are on safe/short passes designed to make it easy on Ponder and give Harvin a lot of yards after contact (YAC) opportunities. Tight end Kyle Rudolph is the next best option and has been great in the middle of the field, but he is starting to draw a lot of attention from defenses in recent weeks. After that, the passing threats are sketchy, although they hoped wide receiver Jerome Simpson could give them some vertical plays.

With an offense that is hard pressed to score a lot of points, the coaches must be more creative in the red zone, looking for TDs instead of field goals, and they need to get the ball into Harvin's hands near the goal line. What is troublesome is that Ponder is seeing great single matchups on the edges as defenses crowd the box to stop running back Adrian Peterson, and the quarterback is not making them pay. If those defenses can take Harvin out of the game, this pass offense is in big trouble.

2. Run offense

One of the biggest surprises in the NFL in the first seven weeks of the season is the positive production of Peterson after his devastating knee injury a year ago. He remains a violent runner, attacking the defense between the tackles, getting yards after contact and making adjustments and jump cuts into the right hole. All of this is coming versus eight- and nine-man defensive fronts that are poised to stop him while daring Ponder to beat them with the passing game.

It is clear that the philosophy of this team is to try to get an early lead and then give the ball to Peterson to control the clock and close out the game. The Vikings will use more multi-TE sets to improve the run game, and their adjustment to a power man-blocking scheme from the former zone-blocking philosophy seems to fit Peterson's skills.

Toby Gerhart is a good change-of-pace power back, and when Harvin lines up as a running back he can carry the ball between the tackles and shows surprising toughness. The success of this run game should continue, and the Vikings' success is tied to this part of the offense. Now if Ponder could ever take advantage of play-action …

3. Pass defense

[+] Enlarge
Tom Dahlin/Getty Images
Antoine Winfield is solid in pass protection, and the Vikings will use him to blitz from his cornerback position.
This remains a Cover 2 defensive scheme by nature, but it is not as predictable as it has been in the past. At the core of the Vikings' philosophy is to rush four and drop seven into coverage. In Week 7 versus Arizona, they did not blitz once. When they get ahead, their goal is to pin their ears back with a four-man rush that will play some games with twists and stunts on the way to the QB.

We see a lot of two-deep safeties, but they can invert those looks, they can go to Cover 3 and Cover 1 looks, and if they do blitz they love to bring a defensive back, especially cornerback Antoine Winfield, off the edge or off the slot. They will also show some press looks with their corners in an effort to reroute receivers because they know they have safety help behind them.

They have two solid pass-defenders in the secondary in Winfield and safety Harrison Smith, and they are really good at reading and jumping routes. This defense has produced only four interceptions and needs more explosive plays, but the design of the defense doesn't let receivers get behind the DBs to make big plays against them. If the pass rush is good, this defense can keep the Vikings in a lot of games.

4. Run defense

A lot of people thought this defense would take its biggest hit in 2012 versus the run, but so far it has been respectable in this area. Because the Vikings are so active with their front four, their movement confuses a lot of blocking schemes in almost run-blitz looks. As one-gap penetrators, they don't leave a lot of big lanes to fill. The defensive tackles inside stack well to allow the linebackers to flow to the ball, and the defensive ends on the edge, as well as Winfield, are excellent at coming down inside and tackling ball carriers before they get to the line of scrimmage.

What is really impressive is how well this unit tackles, and I think the Vikings are the best form-tackling defense in the NFL. They are physical, they wrap up and they break down in the open field. And they have playmakers on all three levels, led by inside linebacker Chad Greenway. You would expect this defense to continue to play well against the run, but good offenses may adjust to their pass-rush mentality when they are playing with a lead and gouge them up front with trap plays, whams, etc.

5. Special teams

The kicking game gives the Vikings a chance to actually stay in some games against superior opponents. With an offense that is challenged to produce a lot of scoring, getting points in the return game can be a real bonus. Kickoff returner Harvin has dynamic speed and explosiveness and is a threat to go all the way every time he touches the ball. Punt returner Marcus Sherels is not as exciting, but his dependable hands eliminate turnovers and he gives the Vikings good field position.

The blocking for the return game a year ago was not consistent enough with a lot of young players, but they are a year older in 2012 and the blocking is much better. Touchdowns on returns would be a huge boost here, but good production also improves field position, giving a lift to a struggling offense.

6. The future schedule

The good news for the Vikings is they have unexpected wins over San Francisco and Detroit that helped get them to their surprising 5-2 record. The bad news is the rest of their schedule is brutal, with five of their six division games still to be played.

The winnable games look like Tampa Bay (home) this weekend, at St. Louis and home versus Detroit. That leaves home and away games against Green Bay and Chicago and nearly impossible road games at Seattle and Houston. Playing .500 football with this remaining schedule looks overly optimistic. Unless the coaches can hide Ponder's flaws and get the defense to pitch shutouts on a weekly basis, this looks like an 8-8 team at best. Green Bay and Chicago are looking like playoff teams, and it's unlikely we will see three teams from the NFC North make it to the postseason.

When you look for positives, this is a very young team that seems to be growing together. The Vikings are not being forced to rebuild as we thought they would and are getting unexpected ""fountain of youth"" years from some of their aging veterans. They have stayed healthy in 2012, with no players put on injured reserve through seven games. These are all things to feel good about. But the schedule ahead may simply be too much to overcome.

1. I don't know if I can be less excited to see McNabb today

2. Way to lose a yard on a swing pass.

3. **HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT PLAY WAS CALLED??!?!?**  Oh God this might be a long afternoon

4. All in all the special teams have been good.  They get a pass

5. SACK and a facemask....penalties will kill us, and our parents, and our significant others...

6. Nice sackish kind of thing except when we let them get a first down the next play

7. It's not the second half.  WTF is going on?

8. OOOOOO  OOOO   OOOOOOOOOOOOO  DAMN.  Aww, I wish you would have caught that 'toine.  All in all not a terrible series.  Less penalties please

9. This Prius commercial is creepy as fuck

10. Did anyone watch Land of the Lost last week?  I have it on my DVR.  Is it worth 2 hours of my life?

11. Nice to see Peterson's here today

12. We love running that sweep, and Percy is good at it

13. And a penalty

14.  Perfect!!!  Berrian's final reception before the bye week is called back!!

15. Good good run.  Do you think Peterson ever wants to punch McNabb in the face?  I think he does...often

16. FIRST DOWN!!!!  it's the little things, really

17.  **TOUCHDOWN BY ONE OF THE EX-BEAR WIDE RECEIVERS BOTH OF WHOM NOTORIOUSLY DROP THE BALL ALL TIME TIME!!!**  That play was amazing on many different levels.  Nice score.  Now McNabb's job is safe for another week because *look what amazing things he is capable of*

18. D looks decent today, just need to not kill themselves with penalties

19. I've said it before, it makes me crazy when Allen runs to far up field and they run right at where he ""should"" be

20. Nice stop D

21. Peterson *could* have a huge game today...*could*

22. OH NO!  We DO NOT need an o-line injury...at all

23. KYLE RUDOLPH IS GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

24. That was terrible.  Look, did we learn NOTHING from 4-1 last week?  **GIVE THE BALL TO PETERSON, QUIT BEING CUTE**  Nice conversion, but sheesh.

25. oh no...not a fumble...oh no

26.  Subreddit is quiet today

27. NOT A FUMBLE!  Get the review right! Whew

28. OMG OMG OMG.  Someone is retarded...it's McNabb or Peterson.  OMG

29. OHOLY SHIT!!!  OH FFS!!!!!!!!!!  Nice tackle by McNabb, but I think I'm going to be ill

30. ......

31. I'm just....something....stop them, make em settle for 3...c'mon

32. nice pressure.  nice pressure

33. WTF was that?  I'll take it, but wtf?  He gave up.  Good!

34. It's never good when your QB and coach yell at each other on the sideline, just ask Chilly and Favre

35. Nice catch Harvin.  McNabb might have figured out that Percy isn't 6'6"" this week.  Good to learn things

36. Here's a question I have...what are McNabb's hot reads?  It seems like he is totally lost when there is blitz pressure.

37. Let's shut em down before half!

38. Another dumbass penalty

39. B-ROB AND JA!!!!!!!!!!  Nice nice nice!

40. Good tackle by Winfield

41. SHUT DOWN!!!

42. AND WE'RE DOWN AT HALF FOR THE FIRST TIME ALL YEAR!!!!!  This ***has*** to be a good thing....right?  right??

43. As bad a KC has looked, they're winning.  I'm not even sure how

I don't feel good.  Bad turnover and bad bad penalties

1. Run D has been awesome

2. Close...good stop

3. WHERE'S THE FLAG!??!?!!!!!  Oh...there it is

4. Gotta keep feeding Peterson the ball.  Especially if he keeps getting 4 yards per

5.  I keep getting so nervous everytime McNabb throws the ball...I have zero trust in him

6. lkfjdsal;kfjdslak;fjdka;lsjfdkls;ajfdkljnmckxnzmclk cknajkfdkdskan  I hate him

7. Maybe if we hadn't seen Farve meltdown so badly last year I would have more patience.  But Donovan keeps missing what should be routine throws.  Completely missing them.  It is so very disheartening as a fan to see shit like this.  What more does he have to do to get benched.  It's like he has one good play per game and then stinks it up the rest of the time and the coaching staff gives him a pass.  It's depressing.  Look, we may end up winning this game, and we can not blame everything on McNabb, but it's like, how bad does he need to be to get benched.  This falls on the coaching staff fully and solely.  Perhaps Ponder isn't ready, then put Webb in.  He can't do any worse and at least his excellent mobility can make up for some of how bad the o-line is.  I have 100% had it

8. Uggg.....DAMMIT.  UUUUUGGGGG

9. GET UP GREENWAY!!!!!!!!!  He walked off on his own

10. Where is the block in the back there?  Where's the call??

11. **WATCH FOR THE FAKE!**  And omg he made it?  Now we have to score.  This is terrible

12. **ANOTHER FUCKING PENALTY EVERY DAMN GAME THIS STUFF KILLS US**

13. Berrian is no where near the ball...terrible pass.  I'm depressed officially now and a crappy 3rd down pass.

14. Is Kluwe the only one on the punt team that can tackle now?  Amazing

15. Should be and is offensive pass interference.  That's a huge helper

16. It doesn't matter.  At all.  Huge first down by KC.

17. Time to come up big D.  Good work.  Will they go for it?  Watch for the fake

18. Big stand defense.  Now let's march down the field and score a TD....AAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA...no I'm serious...AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH :(

19. WWOOOOHOOOOO PERCY! And nevermind..........incomplete

20. Yep...he could have run for it.  **GET HIM THE FUCK OUT OF THERE NOW.  THIS TEAM HAS NO LIFE WITH HIM IN THERE.  NONE.  THEY HAVE THE ENERGY LEVEL OF A SLEEPY SLOTH.  GET HIM OUT**

21. OMG  Flag?  Nevermind.  I have no idea what is going on.  Griffen just stumbled.  *sighsighsigh*.  The D is tired.  That should not have happened, but holy shit get something going on O.  If they don't yank McNabb and he plays and doesn't do anything.........doesn't matter.  He's done, he has to be.  This is completely inexcusable.  Totally and completely

22. **HOW CAN YOU PUT MCNABB IN????  HOW HOW HOW HOW HOW HOW HOW???**

23. Nice run Percy...very nice

24. What?  Wha.....  :(:(:(:(:(

25. HOLY SHIT BERRIAN!  

26. Ok ok ok.  This isn't terrible

27. Look at that, need a yard and give it to Peterson, you get the yard.  Who woulda thunk?

28. Sooo close.  Try again!

29. I don't care at this point.  Do it again

30. Thank God, touchdown.  I do like Jenkins

31. OK D...time for a bigtime stand.  You can do it, so do it

32. Got them pushed back...let's see what the D can do

33. Whew...need more pressure

34. OKOKOKOKOK...ONE MORE STOP!  AND THEY CALL A TIMEOUT!!!!!!  THANKS A LOT!

35. STOPPED!!!!!!!!!

36. Need some o.  Let's see what we can do.  And, yes, McNabb still needs to be benched

37. We have a long long way to go.  But we have a lot of time.  

38. Keep going...keep going

39. **PERCY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

40. Come on let's f'ing go!

41. Eww...more better passes we need

42. WTF DEFLECTIONS!!!!!!

43. FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF

44. Don't throw it to him again.  He caught his biweekly pass already

45. I.....I....... :(

46. That sequence sums up, perfectly, the season so far

47. Game over................................................................................

Frazier will be fired unless things turn around.  He has to see this.  I don't care that McNabb had one good drive and one other good pass.  It is simply not enough.

We are now playing for draft picks and next year.  It's that simple.  We need to play our young guys and see what we have.

1353887399.0	13s78e	I can't even blame Ponder for this one...	bagmagick	31	5	35	"
* I can’t put the blame on Ponder for this one. No, he didn’t light up the Bears defense. He even threw a bad interception. But by the by, he made many good decisions and ran the offense well. Most of his passes were on the money or close, and he didn’t have nearly the kind of time you’d like to see someone have. “But Kaepernick lit up the same defense!” There were two things that Kaep had that Ponder doesn’t, which ties to my next two points:

* Receivers? Pardon the upcoming French, but what the fuck was that? Yes, Ponder only completed 59% of his passes today, but if you factor in drops, Ponder’s accuracy would have been closer to 65%, which is respectable. Listen, Jerome Simpson, you are supposed to be a #2 receiver on this team. You can’t drop passes that hit you dead square in the chest. You can’t. That’s how you lose your job. I’d be okay with cutting you tomorrow, for how little you produce for the offense. John Carlson? Terrible. He’ll be gone from this team by next year. Stephen Burton, a guy who’s on the fringe of the roster, has dropped his only targets two games in a row. That’s not how you make a team as a receiver. At least we know now that Jarius Wright definitely has the goods. Kyle Rudolph is an above-average pass-catching tight end. But he’s hurt now. Great. This was a team that desperately missed a reliable chain-moving, pass-catching receiver who could be counted on in a tough spot. This team needs Percy Harvin back badly.

* The Playcalling? Bill Musgrave needs to go. Many fans are upset about the series in which the Vikes went out in a shotgun formation and failed to produce on 3rd and 2 and 4th and 2. We have Adrian Peterson. It shouldn’t even be a difficult call. Listen, I understand calling for passing plays there. It’s not what I would have done, but I can understand it. But why were the calls so pass-heavy in the first half? It’s clear that Adrian needs time to start really going to work on a defense. He needs touches early. He fumbled on his first carry? So what. This the guy we hang our hats on. The best running back in the world. He fumbled? Give him the ball back. He’ll run all the harder for it.

Those two factors account for the offensive struggles. Had we been running more often and had receivers been catching the passes they were targeted on, or for Pete’s sake at least getting open, we would have been back in the game. We would have possessed the ball for much longer drives. The defense would have been able to play more aggressively.

* But where was the pass rush? What’s wrong with this unit? They produced so much more effectively in the past. The personnel is the same, which leads me to believe that either the players aren’t as good as they used to be, or the coaching scheme is damaging their production. I don’t believe that Jared Allen is over the hill yet. Brian Robison is a respectable young defensive end. Letroy Guion/ Fred Evans are still the journeymen they always were. But Kevin Williams? It’s possible that he’s lost something. I think it’s either that or that Alan Williams scheme is not well suited for this defensive line. They couldn’t have had a better match up this week. Two more starters went down during the course of the game. What happened?

I think these are the factors that led to today’s outcome. Please correct me if I’m wrong.

TL;DR: Ponder looked *okay,* receivers suck, Musgrave sucks, and what the heck is wrong with the defensive line?"	t5_2qocl	True

I even turned it sideways as a ""rally cap"" at the point where we got the ball back right before Walsh's ""amazing-oh-my-god-did-you-see-that-that-was-incredible"" game-tying kick.  As you all know from sports experience, the power of the ""rally cap"" is real and awesome.  You know the outcome.  On the leg of our rookie kicker, we won.

Well, during week 2 I was up at my family's cabin, and I did not have the Viking horn helmet.  As you know, we lost that game.  The power of the ""rally cap"" cannot be ignored.  I will wear my Viking horn helmet, as a ""rally cap"" as needed, during all Viking games that I can.

I sincerely apologize for my lack of composure and dedication to this team, and for causing our loss in week 2.  Please forgive me."	t5_2qocl	True

Remember, today isn't just about fresh-out-of-school rookies. It's about guys without a credited season. That means Roderick Williams (CFL), Bobby Felder (practice squad), etc, are included here too.

Today is important for two reasons:

1. We get our first look at our draft investments. Are our 1st-rounders all they're cracked up to be? Did we find any late-round contributors? 

2. Which UDFAs and other signings, if any, will contribute? Can we all shut up about Duron Carter? Is Roderick Williams a legit NFL cornerback? Can Bobby Felder continue his rise form last offseason and make the roster?

So far, Tom has made the following interesting points:

-Sharrif Floyd is [huge](https://twitter.com/TomPelissero/status/330347243972485121/photo/1).

-Michael Mauti is moving around as well as can be expected, though he's just doing light jogging and drills.

-Patterson looks explosive and volatile, even in installation. ""Smooth mover,"" according to Tom. [Here he is destroying a jam and making a nice catch.](http://telly.com/K3B5RH)

-In his first one-on-one, Xavier Rhodes got an INT.

-Duron Carter seems to be in over his head. EDIT: Apparently he dropped his first three balls, but has since calmed his nerves.

**-Edit:** According to Frazier, Erin Henderson, Audie Cole, Tyrone McKenzie, and Michael Mauti are all in the running for the MLB spot.

**Another Edit:** Michael Mauti told the press he's mostly learning MLB, plus a little WLB. When asked if he'll be ready for camp, he replied, ""Absolutely. That's my goal."""	t5_2qocl	True

[Mine has got to be Jared Allen vs Donald Penn during the Tampa Bay game.](http://www.vikings.com/media-vault/videos/Allen-Gets-Bloodied-vs-Tampa-Bay/f321fb02-36b8-49bb-8723-2700dc2d8e30)

Jared Allen and Donald Penn got in a scuffle. Penn started throwing hands and Jared responded in kind. Jared's helmet ended up on the ground and his nose was bloodied. I've never seen Jared Allen so pissed.

The home crowd was going insane after the refs sorted things out. 3rd and 10. We're down by 13 near the end of the 3rd quarter. 

Tampa Bay has to call a timeout because of the noise. The crowd gets even louder. When the Bucs gets back on the field, it's an absolute frenzy in the stadium. 

Alan Williams made a unique decision and put *both* Jared Allen and Everson Griffen on the right side. They both fire off the line, and about 3 seconds later, Jared Allen is dragging down Josh Freeman for a sack.

Other than AP's final run against Green Bay for the record, I never screamed that loud during a televised Vikings game. I was fired up. First I was angry at Penn for knocking Jared's helmet off, then happy in my small victory when the home crowd ""won"" and caused TB to call a timeout, and then I was defiantly ecstatic when Jared blew past Penn for the sack. I know it doesn't look special in the video, but this was a 5-6 minute ordeal in real time. And considering the preceding events, Jared was running off pure anger and adrenaline, and *it was awesome.*"	t5_2qocl	True
