As someone who was born in the early '90s, I haven't seen every movie they reference.

1339955762.0	v6oas	If you watch Psych backwards...	panama_dave	99	34	20	"It tells the story of a couple who are most definitely made for one another. They complement each others strengths. But as time goes on they begin to drift apart. Eventually separating, but still sharing long glances and the occasional close encounter of getting back together.

But things get in the way. Work consumes both of them. They begin dating other people. Shawn finds a stable relationship fairly soon, but it doesn't last. We do see that when Shawn and Juliet are in a room together you can tell something is still there. Shawn's life starts to lose focus. He finds a new love interest each week and his relationship with his father slowly unravels.

As time goes on there is less and less interaction between Shawn and Juliet. They acknowledge each other and are cordial, but each new relationship the other has affects them. They try to hide their hurt, but they know things can't go back to the way they were.

Juliet is in constant torment seeing the man she once loved and cared for so much be so indiscriminate with the women he now chooses to be with. Shawn becomes more shallow and self-centered than before, believing that this is the only way he can quell the desire to go back to Juliet.

It becomes too much for Juliet. She is offered the opportunity to transfer to Miami. Seeing it as way to start fresh she transfers and tries to forget about the man she leaves behind. Shawn stays in Santa Barbara for a short time, continuing to work with the police department. But it eventually becomes too much to bear, always waiting for her to turn the corner and have everything back to normal. He finally can't take it anymore and leaves Santa Barbara, bouncing from one job to the next, trying to get as far away from the memory of his true love as possible.

What episodes are you looking forward to? I can't seem to find the list of 20 that you could vote from. But top on my list is probably ""Lights, Camera ... Homicidio"" and then ""Shawn Rescues Darth Vader""

Also, share your slumber party setup. I've got popcorn and Pineapple Orange Juice so far. (I will let you know how the Orange Juice tastes) Pineapple Orange Juice is delicious!

1345331617.0	yg5bu	My favorite bit of continuity from Psych.	EasilyRemember	50	3	16	"In S02E09 ""Bounty Hunters!"", Shawn and Gus take a fugitive to Henry's house and make up a story that he was their camp counselor at Camp Tikihama.  Henry, suspicious that Shawn is lying about the man's true identity, questions him about the camp.  He asks the fugitive to sing a song from camp, so he clearly makes up a lame song on the spot:

*Camp Tikihama, what you are*  
*Reaches near and reaches far,*  
*From white capped mountains to crystal lakes,*  
*Sing out loud for Tiki sakes!*

*We are friends who bond over bright ember fires,*  
*And to marshmellow dreams we will retire,*  
*Camp Tikihama you're so true,*  
*La-la-la-la-la and then love you,*  
*La-la-la-la-la and then love you!*

Over a year later, in S03E15 ""Tuesday the 17th"", the episode opens with a long tracking shot through the now defunct Camp Tikihama.  During this opening scene, there is a soft, creepy rendition of the exact same song that the fugitive made up in S02E09.  Pretty subtle, but a great callback for attentive fans.

Another good one is in S01E10, there's a recurring joke about Gus being stealthy, ""like a jackal.""  Later, in S03E12, Gus tells Shawn to ""hit the jackal switch"" before he goes into stealth mode.  This joke may be used a couple other times as well over the course of the series, but I can't recall any specific instances.  Any other good continuity jokes you guys can think of?"	t5_2qxd2	True

So I just wanted to thank all of you for adding and being a part of this community, and bringing us to a whopping **538 readers**, up from the measly 15 or so we started with, when the idea of commandeering this reddit was just a joke. Well it is now a reality, and a successful one at that. 

In celebration of reaching 500, I will be distributing **'Gus Nickname'** flair similar to my own, both randomly and when requested, please ask for one in the comments if you want one. And if you do not want one that I randomly give you, just tell me and I'll fix or delete at your request. If you all don't think that having flair is good for this reddit, let me know and we can decide as a community. 

As always if anyone has any ideas/suggestions to make us the greatest subreddit ever, don't be afraid to request, make a post or whatever, as it actually helps us know what will keep you guys coming back and attracting new readers. Keep up the great posts and comments guys, this reddit is really turning into something great!!

1334267805.0	s6vrh	Santa Barbara: The 13th biggest per capita Murder capital in the U.S. (according to Psych)	chocolaterain72	49	2	12	"So, I was wondering recently about the amount of murders that occur in Santa Barbara, and how that doesn't jive with the real world, so I did some math.  In psych's 6 years on the air there have been 95 episodes.  In each episode at least one person is murdered.  If we say that ONLY 95 murders have been committed on psych (which we know there are a few more than that) over six years, we can extrapolate that to a number of just under 16 murders a year.  Santa Barbara has a population of 90,000 people, and per capita murder rates are based on murders out of 100,000 people, so we have to make the number out of 100,000 people, which bumps it up to 18 murders a year.  18 murders a year comes in at the 13th highest murder rate per 100,00 people behind:

New Orleans, St. Louis, Baltimore, Detroit, Newark, Oakland, Washington D.C., Kansas City, Buffalo, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, Cleveland
and ahead of Pittsburgh, Atlanta, Miami and Chicago.

And that's if there is just one murder per episode, and doesn't include any murders the psych team doesn't solve.  For a city of 90,000 people, Santa Barbara is a really fucking dangerous place.  They should really start an anti-crime initiative."	t5_2qxd2	True

(Update: I am going to cut the episode apart into separate episodes.  It should be apparent while watching just the Dark timeline that Shawn magically starts to know things).

**General facts that apply to both timelines**

* Anders took Torstin's gun, Torstin doesn't know about it until safe opens.
* Anders was the first victim, this is where Elin gets the gun to kill the second victim.
* Elin loses the gun at the creek, when attempting to kill the second victim.
* The beginning of the episode where he says ""What just happened"", was the end of the episode where he says ""What just happened"".

**Dark world (REAL) facts**

* The only information revealed about Cory Wuff and Eric Palma is their relationship to Elin (they dated her). 
* The inclusion of a gun is ONLY mentioned when Lassie brings up the first victim.  It is never a plot point that drives the story further in this timeline.
* Elin kills Torstin incase Anders told Torstin anything about her (knowing the police were investigating)
* Torstin dies never tying the gun from murder #1 to Anders
* Torstin dies, never revealing Anders is a psychiatrist
* Elin being an ""unstable patient"" is never revealed.
* Elin's Stepfather is *never* mentioned.
* Elin goes to dispose of Anders body

**Light World Facts**

* The inclusion of a gun is first discussed when Jules brings up the first victim.
* Shawn learns of the location of the gun used in the first murder from a photo of the creek-side crime scene.
* The Gun is registered to Torstin, and since Elin is dead, he is never killed.
* Torstin reveals Elin's M.O., which is to attack people with the profile of her father (writers)
* Torstin reveals Anders is a Psychiatrist.
* Torstin reveals Elin was an unstable patient who attacked men who fit her father's profile (a writer).
* Cory Wuff and Eric Palma are established to be writers.

**The Reveal**

* Shawn wakes up in dark timeline
* Gus tells shawn ""Look, Lassie followed up on your hunch about that hospital in stockholm.""  **The Dark timeline never suggested anything about her being a patient, that information died with Anders and Torstin**
* In chiefs office Lassie says her stepfather did a real number on her, Shawn says ""yup, that's an understatement"" and then... ""Elin was out there finding guys who fit her stepfather's profile and taking them out"".  **He says this with absolute confidence, as if someone had told him... because Torstin told him**
* ""She killed Anders because he wanted to take her back to sweden"" ~He never actually says he's a psychiatrist though, so this one is shakey since Elin told him he was an ex-boyfriend out to attack her.  This is a wash.
* ""She stole the gun that Anders took from Torstin"".  **NEVER EVER EVER EVER** was *any* information regarding the gun revealed in the Dark timeline.
* The rest of the reveal *completely depends upon these revelations* and could only be pieced together by knowing the source of the gun and the motive.  Without knowing Anders is a psychiatrist, there is no reason to believe Elin had motive to kill Torstin, since he was simply providing shelter to Anders.
* Edit: To clarify, knowing she was the killer is not what he divined, we know he knows that because of her shoes.  What he divines is her motive, something **impossible** to know without having a vision, since the information to fill that in was never discussed in the dark timeline.

**Trivial things that hint at this being true**

* When shawn ""wakes up"", and the rewind happens, he ONLY REWINDS THE LIGHT WORLD back to the split.
* When talking to gus, he's confused, and isn't sure which world he's in.
* The above is supported by the fact that he forgot he was cut
* Furthermore, he is visibly upset about being in the dark world, because of the situation with Jules (it's very apparent)


The only major ""Wait what?  I don't understand"" thing is... when Shawn finds her moving Anders body, she should have already handled it.  Since this is the ""real"" timeline, and that *is* what she was doing, his body has been sitting somewhere for days, and she just then decides to move it and dump it at her mother's death site.  I guess she's just dumb and crazy, or the writers tied his murder in somewhat half-assedly, because everything else she did was logical.

We know the story that just played out had exactly the same initial causes, and the way the characters interacted lead to (essentially) the same ending of figuring out who did it (with the exception being Torstin is alive in the Light World).  The SINGLE difference is the light world provided Shawn the clues to figure out the MO, tying ALL the murders to her - where the Dark world only showed him that she had killed Anders, leaving him stumped to explain the rest.

During the final scene with Jules... Shawn continues to have ""What if"" visions.  This is potential foreshadowing. During the ""What If"", Jules tell him SPECIFICALLY *""don't tell me that if I hadn't found the jacket we would still be happy""*, and then he goes and does it.   What I think... was Jules cames to do the very thing he just saw... but his dumb ass talked before Jules could tell him to shut up.

Our good friend Shawn is a goddamn psychic.

I kind of hope that they're covered in the third ending that wasn't shown, but... I somehow doubt it.  Two little trifles, really.

Plot Hole the First: What happened to the cell phones?  They never recovered them.  Clue at least explained how the weapons cabinet got open again, but 100 Clues never explained how anyone took the cell phones.

Plot Hole the Second: So.  Lassiter and Juliet came looking for the dead guy in the freezer because there was blood all over his abandoned car down the road.  Actually, this leads me to two questions.  First, how did he get to the house, and did he just not think to call AAA once he got there?  And second, if he was murdered at the house, whose blood was in the car?

Plot Hole the Third: I didn't actually have this question until right now when I was thinking about the AAA thing, and my mind is weird.  How did Leslie not know who the host was when she had been to that house before?  And she knew Clizby, quite intimately I might add!

Sorry, these were bugging me.  Discuss!  Or, don't, I'm a bored Redditor, not your mom."	t5_2qxd2	True

Temus12	43	8	17	"I was re-watching ""Speak now or forever hold your piece"" (the wedding episode in season 1) and at the end of the episode, Shawn makes a remark about what he will do as Gus's best man. In response, Gus chuckles and says ""You are NOT gonna be my best man."" I had always thought that at the beginning of the series they were supposed to be seemingly very different people but somehow were always best friends. After hearing that line though, I felt as though that's not quite how the writers saw their relationship at the start, and that they had planned Gus to have more current good friends besides Shawn."	t5_2qxd2	True
1328900694.0	pjplf	Thoughts from a new Psych fan who watched all seasons in the past two weeks	_calliope	48	8	25	"I was looking for new show recommendations and my friend told me to watch Psych, so I did. I finished all the episodes in two weeks.  

As a new fan, I just wanted to post my thoughts on the series.  I'm excited to have found this subreddit!

* I'm not quite satisfied with how TPTB have handled Shawn/Juliet as a couple. I like the sweetness between them (""I'm very fond of you"", the balloon ride, etc.) and I'm sure a lot of this comes from James and Maggie being a real life couple, but things just seem off on screen for some reason.  
* The tongue in cheek product placement mentions are hilarious, especially Shawn's love of Snyder's of Hanover pretzels.
* Favorite episodes: The Yin/Yang series, American Duos (if only for the performance at the end of the show), Christmas Joy, the hangover episode, One, Maybe Two Ways Out, and any episode with Despereaux because I love Cary Elwes.
* Shawn seems to have been dumbed down in recent episodes, at least compared to the first couple of seasons. And Lassiter has become a lot more accommodating of Shawn's flights of fancy. 
* I don't like Henry working at the police station but I guess they needed to find a way to bring him into the storylines other than the scattered scenes of Shawn running to him for last minute advice.
* I'd love another trilogy. I thought the Yin/Yang episodes were riveting and thrilling yet also captured the humor that is so unique to this show.
* While I love the Shawn/Gus bromance, Shawn constantly using Gus's credit card really irks me.  
* ""Gus, don't be _____"" 
* I like how the theme song changes depending on the show.  The Twin Peaks homage was by far the best version.
* One of my favorite scenes is from Shawn Interrupted when Shawn plays Kenny G. then Jules and Lassie walk in to find Gus gyrating to the music. Hilarious."	t5_2qxd2	True
