I want to detour into the Nordstrom shoe department on the way to the movies? He is right there with me. No heavy sighing or eye rolling from my guy! Got a run in my stockings while getting ready for work? Crossdresser boyfriend to the rescue!

Seriously, if your girlfriends have an issue with it they just aren't looking at it in the right light, because objectively speaking I think I can safely say that boys who dress are the best.

Also, I lurk in here a lot, and boy you all sure are pretty."	t5_2rmf8	True

1367886106.0	1dtupc	For what it's worth, my thoughts on this subreddit...	letterstosnapdragon	86	16	16	"First off, I grew up in a generation where the internet was a new thing when I was in late high school, early college. And the first things I looked up on Netscape were crossdressing and transgender sites. So believe me, I've seen an awful lot of cringe-worthy CD sites. Some of you may remember when CD sites had ""web-mistresses"" and links where you could ""fe-mail"" them. And there was no shortage of photos of dicks in panties or hairy legs in pantyhose and lots and lots of asshole shots. 

And I like that this subreddit draws a line against NSFW content because I don't feel like seeing it. And that's really the only line I like having. 

Yes, I like that there is a wide variety of people on this board. There are those who do their best to try and pass and those who are just beginning. There are fearless people who show their faces and those who aren't quite there yet because they might lose their SO's or homes or support. I like having those who speak their minds and those who lurk, but will hopefully contribute one day too. I think there is room on this board for all levels and I like being able to share what I've learned with people just starting out. 

We don't need to splinter. If you don't like a link, don't upvote it, and if you want to see more of something, post more of it!

We're a small community anyway and we dilute ourselves further by splinting into smaller sub-sub-reddits. 

I do wish we had more text content, links to articles and stuff beyond just pictures, so maybe I should take it upon myself to try and post more diverse links that aren't just pictures. 

Otherwise, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. I think we've got a good subreddit and I wanted to show my appreciation to everyone. "	t5_2rmf8	True

Lately my wife has been assisting me, we've gone shopping and picked out several nice outfits, some shoes, etc. as well as experimented with makeup. However, this weekend was the first time we put it all together (plus first time shaving, everywhere). To say I was happy would be an understatement ;). We didn't go out yet, but have plans to for next weekend :D

Please let me know how I did!

Thanks,
Nora

P.S. A huge thanks to my wife, because I couldn't have possibly have done this without her. (she might read this, and I can't thank her enough)

1365653574.0	1c45ka	So I came out to a friend this weekend...	sissymissy_winkwink	65	10	15	"I've been having a lot of trouble keeping Marissa bottled up lately...she really wants to make an appearance more often. Most of my friends are straight cis dudebros who, while perfectly liberal and open-minded, have probably never met a CD or trans person before and would probably find it a little shocking if I (as someone who generally presents as a straight cis dudebro) announced my love for all things girly. So coming out to them is out of the question, for now at least.

But this last week, I made a new friend, this girl I always see around campus in the coolest, funkiest outfits (that I of course would DIE to have). I struck up a conversation with her, got her number, and hung out with her a few days later. She was telling me about how she never wears pants, only skirts, and I 'jokingly' said ""i would too, if i could."" This led to a discussion of gender norms and their silliness and the fun of feminine clothing, and she asked me outright if I've ever crossdressed. I was forced to respond, ""yes, actually, all the time.""

She was really accepting...well beyond accepting, more like enthusiastic. We ended up going
thrift shopping immediately after that and she helped me pick out a bunch of cute dresses. Then she asked if she could take me to our school's Queer Prom. Needless to say, I was elated- going to prom in a pretty dress has been a life long dream.

 She's one of the first people I've come out too besides an ex, my therapist, and one other friend. Sorry if this was kind of a pointless story, but I'm just really excited and wanted to share!



**tl;dr: made a new friend, went dress shopping, got asked to prom! I am a very happy crossdresser right now. Pics coming soon!**

Today my best friend of many years opened up to me and told me that he cross dresses. I had absolutely no idea that he had been into this for a while, and we have known each other since middle school. Although I was taken off guard, I know it took some serious courage to tell me. So Ryan, if you see this, I just want you to know that I am proud of you for sharing that with me and you will always be my best friend.

---------------  
  
It's taken me some life to realize that no matter who you are, you have to own it.  You can't be embarrassed about anything, because then it becomes shameful.  
  
That doesn't mean you necessarily need to flaunt anything in anyone's face, but if confronted, you can be confident in how awesome you are: regardless.  
  
Who's a better person (and who would you rather be): Some dude in your school / office who has been publically outted as a crossdressing freak, and who has to look away from everyone's gaze in his now-public-shame?  Or would you rather have some secret whispers behind your back, but walk with pride at how weird and strange you are, meeting people's gazes and causing *them* to be uncomfortable if they aren't ok with your hobbies?  
  
**The truth of life is that no-one is normal.**  Everyone has some weird and horrible secret.  
  
So don't feel the need to flaunt the fact that you enjoy dressing up like a chick sometimes.  But if you are ever outed?  Own the situation.

I worked at a young women's clothing chain. I was the assistant manager at the time and as such had to open the store sometimes. I usually closed because the manager worked days and would only work nights on the required day (Friday night). but company rules said I had to open 2 days a week so I got stuck with Wednesdays and Sundays. Which was fine with me because I was a night owl and Wednesdays were are slowest days and I often wouldn't even see a customer until noon. only down side was we rarely made our quotas on this day and would get ""talked to"" by our district manager frequently.

Well one morning an older man came in about an hour after we opened (maybe 50-60s, I was 19 at the time). He was a small guy but in good shape. He was quiet but seemed like a sweet older guy. He walked around the store for a while. Bought a top he said was for his wife and left. I didn't think much of it.

He then started coming in every Wednesday morning and would buy an item or two. Over time he became more talkative. We would talk about things off topic a few times. it was a welcome reprieve since the mall was dead most Wednesdays and I worked alone on these days. After a month or so he started asking me for advice on clothes. Asking if his wife would like certain items. He asked if they would fit her claiming she was his exact height and about his body frame etc. Didn't think anything of it. Helped him pick out stuff for her aiming at clothes an older woman would wear (not our clothes aimed at teenage hookers lol)

I guess he became comfortable with me over time. One day while helping him try and pick out clothes he finally says ""Ok i have a confession. As much as sometimes these clothes are in fact for my wife. Most of it is for me"" I could see he was nervous about telling me and he waited for my reaction. So I go ""Oh ok...well, then this is not a good shirt"" and continue to help him find clothes better suited to him. I could literally see the relief in him. He goes on to tell me that on the weekends him and his wife go out to the drag clubs and he dressed up. They had a ton of fun doing it and how it had breathed life back into their failing marriage and brought them back together. He told me how they went from being on the edge of divorce during his mid life crisis into a couple that couldn't take their hands off each other. it was such a sweet story. He thanked me profusely for being ok with what and who he was. I told him I was proud of him for being himself and I was glad it was something him and his wife could enjoy together. He was so happy because a few other stores shamed him and told him he could not go to their stores. I told him he was always welcome at my store and He bought a few things and left.

The next week he comes in and asks if he could try on stuff. I told him as long as there were no female customers who needed the fitting room it was ok but that if a female did come in he would need to come out and let her use it (I had asked my manager who asked the district ahead of time in case the question had popped up). He said he was perfectly ok with this as it was a female clothing store and we only had one fitting room area. Plus we were so dead this day of the week it was never a problem anyways.

So the next week I get there to open my store and he is waiting outside with a platic bag. He had brought in his wig, his high heels, his spanx and his bra that had fake boobies in it. he wanted to see how things would look in his full get up. He wanted to get there early so there was no chance of someone else coming in to use the fitting room. I loved it. It was so much fun. I actually told him I was jealous because he looked better in the mini skirts than I did lol That day he ended up buying $600 worth of stuff which was our quota and I sold it in one transaction. On top of that we got gift cards if we did transactions over $500 so I ended up making $25 that day :D
He ended up being my best customer that year. He came in almost every Wednesday. The days he brought his whole get up, he would be waiting outside my store at opening with his lil plastic bag. About every other week he would drop sever hundred dollars. Since Tuesday was our main shipment day there was always new stuff for him. I will never forget him.

When it came time for me to leave he was devastated. i was joining the military and he panicked because he didn't know if he would be able to buy his clothes. Luckily the girl I was training to take my place was as open minded as I was. I told him she would be more than ok with his shopping and he would love her. So the next week I scheduled her to train during my Wednesday shift. I told her about him and she was so excited to be able to help him (she was a very excitable and energetic girl in the adorable way). When he came in that day he was very timid and nervous when he saw her. I told him to come in and meet her. He reluctantly came in. When I went to introduce her to him she cuts me off and goes ""OMG is this him?! Hi I am A***** I am so excited to meet you!"" he kinda looks at me but responds to her. She immediately took him away and began asking him questions and helping him pick out stuff. As I was watching I could see him relaxing as she went along. I knew he would be in good hands.

He asked me for my email when I left and for quite some time I received email correspondence from him. he would tell me how nice she was and how he still went in each week and bought stuff. The normal life stories and such. He was such a nice older man and I was so happy I could help him feel comfortable in his own skin. We've lost touch over the years and I still sometimes wonder how he is. I wish everyone could be so welcoming and understanding so people like him won't have to be ashamed of themselves. So glad my momma raised me so well and open minded &lt;3

1346477718.0	z6ayl	Konoka - You have been accused of posting pictures of people that are not you, please respond.	SarahC	51	5	24	"You have posted this image, and have told people this is you:

http://i.imgur.com/ZIvnv.jpg

I have been contacted by the lady in the photograph you posted, telling me that you have stolen the image, here she is with the same necklace:

http://imgur.com/xWMb0

It is strongly against the communities rules to post such pictures, and I need to see some evidence you are the person in the photograph you took.

I have made this post public, as many people have seen your previous post, and may need to be informed of the alleged deceit.

As you have clearly told people in the original thread that the picture is of you - I will have no choice but to ban you from all the communities I own or moderate in if the allegation is true.

**[I have checked the account, and found it to be new, and only used for posting the infringing image, therefore I'll leave this post up a while, and then remove the user]**"	t5_2rmf8	True

I've never crossdressed before. This is my first time and I'm nervous to what people think.

The hair is done with some spare hair extensions I found laying around, that is why I wore the hat. There is brown and short hair underneath it haha.

I'm taking on-board any advice, and I would love advice.

It's mostly mine, and a few that I don't know where he got them. There is evidence he's been wearing the items and not using them for *other purposes*...

I don't have a problem with any of this. I'm very open and liberal. If that's his thing, I hope he finds happiness, love, and acceptance.

What I DO want to stop is him taking and wearing MY clothes, and possibly stealing the others. I know he's not buying these things himself! 

I guess my question is, what do i do to be a supportive, loving, mom in this situation, without embarrassing him. Being a teen is hard enough!

Thongs... even my makeup, and mflb, they even trashed the tin and threw out the contents. But the worst was when they pull ed out my breast forms and wig... I spent a lot on those two... My father shredded my wig right in front of me and shown me what he did with the forms... It's ridiculous. It's who i am... And we fought for hours that night. I ended up leaving that night staying out for most of the night. I got a friends helped and later the next day i had a lease signed and was moving out.and couldn't find my plugs and girlie stiff any where...when we were finished and i packed my bike from the garage my friend noticed all my things in the trash can torn to shreds!! I went into my parents house and asked my father what the hell they were thinking about doing that to my things!! My precious shoes... I saved for months for just the right wig.... But.... My forms?? Like REALLY? we started shouting at each other and it ended up with dad punching me and my mom screaming I'm not their son anymore to get the fuck out of their house and never come back. :( i don't know what to do anymore any suggestions Gurls??
