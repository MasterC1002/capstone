1316977785.0	kr1sw	A Moderate’s thoughts on the “Occupy Wall Street” protests (or: How I would do the protest the right way)	HardCoreModerate	162	50	102	"I probably express the view of almost every moderately minded person in America when I say that there should be some change in society. There should be an outcry of frustration at some elements of the destruction of the working and middle class. But I do not agree with the protest.  I live in the NYC area and I work in Manhattan. I have seen the protests up close. I am disturbed at the disorganized element that exists within. I am frightened at the lack of understanding that those kids (the majority seem to be disillusioned 20somethings) have about life and how things work. 

It has been increasingly difficult to read what has been posted on reddit about these protests, and even more difficult to comment on them. I find myself sucked into a downward spiral of name calling when I do not mean to and I am accused of being right wing for raising questions about certain ideas and elements.

The idea that we should have more protests of this type is just plain wrong. The organizers of this protest (if they can even be called that with such lack of organization) have shown little tactical ability and a dearth of understanding in how to deal with police, the media or the public at large. 

For people on reddit in r/politics who seem to revel in their political knowledge, particularly of a left wing nature, they seem to have no understanding of how to put together a powerful or meaningful political movement. 

So that brings me to my real point: The protest I would like to see, the protest that would work. 

First: pick a point or goal and stick to it. Tell everyone to stick to it. This isn’t the free Troy Davis protest, this isn’t the anti republican protest, this should be the “Wall street has wronged us” protest. That’s it. Period. Get rid of all other signs. 

Second: organize, organize, organize. Tell everyone to wear the same color, for instance. Make a visual impact. That imprints itself on the psyche of people who see it. If you are going to march, march in a controlled way (meaning, know where you are going and be sure to keep the group together and on target).  Get people to make signs with the same message, so that there is uniformity. 

Thirdly: The police are your friends, if you want them to be. If this is really a focused protest, with organization, then the police will respond accordingly. Talk to them, the more you engage them the more they work with you. They probably agree with you, but they are there to maintain order. If they see you are organized, and you communicate, then they aren’t going to beat you or mace you. But they must also know that you are firm in your goals (see point #1).

Forth: You must, MUST embrace the movements of MLK and Gandhi. This can’t look like a hippie movement. Mainstream America doesn’t like hippies any more than they like right wing racists. Its just a plain fact, and you waving your hippienessin in our face just makes us happy when the cops mace you. Take a page from MLK. Wear a tie. Walk arm in arm. If not a tie, then at least a uniform color to look organized. Look NEAT, presentable. As movement, you must express a quiet anger. Not shouting and blowing whistles. This isn’t a soccer game. 

IF IT WERE MY MOVEMENT: Taking all of the above, here is what I would do if it were my movement. I would make my stated aim a sitdown protest on the stock exchange floor. I would then organize all of my protesters at Bowling Green (subway stop downtown in a park). I would instruct everyone to wear the same color, and be neat and presentable. I would state our aim on a website. I would ensure there were ony a few signs, stating our aim, and requesting economic change on wall street. I would tell the police, politely but firmly that we would be marching. I would then march… arm in arm, 4 to a row, towards the stock exchange. I would use the sidewalks as not to block traffic. 

HERE COMES THE HARD PART:  No movement is successful or has impact without the hard part. We must march, slowly, nonviolently towards the Exchange, arm in arm. We must force the police to bodily restrain us, mace us, do whatever they want to, without ever raising a hand. We must do this in a row, person after person, row after row… must be seen being dragged away without raising a finger. Without screaming, or acting in any way other than passively. America must have a visual of Wall Street blocking access to the middle class, to the people it is supposedly here for. Common ordinary Americans must be made to sympathize and must realize how badly our economy has split between the haves and have nots. 

EDIT: made a clarification on what Bowling Green is.

EDIT2: I have removed a sentence that refenced the Tea Party. Many on the left seem to get STUCK on my one offhand reference, instead of reading my actual points. Therefore it has been removed as to further the discussion and remove any idea that I support that movement."	t5_2s6h3	True

* * *

When I was in college, the university was a Pepsi campus.  At the time, Pepsi was invested in Burma, and there was a nationwide campaign to get Pepsi to divest.  The campaign was focused on colleges (Pepsi's big business is institutional lockups) and gained steam early when Harvard backed out of a $1 million deal after student protests.  At my university, a sizable minority of students protested, at one point occupying the main administration building, preventing entry to it.  That protest lasted a day or two, until the president of the university agreed to investigate whether we could move to Coke.  

A year or two later, the university fired all the janitors and hired a non-union company to provide janitorial services.  Again, big protests, sit-ins, etc., but to an even larger scale.  A lot of campus services shut down as the protestors demanded that the fired janitors be re-hired and be allowed to unionize, with seniority and their old pay rates restored. 

In both cases, I was mostly disinterested -- lukewarmly agreeing with the protestors in the former case, disagreeing in the latter.  And in both cases, I was significantly adversely affected by the protests themselves.  In one case, I had a meeting with the Dean of Students at his request (which, of course, I was in no position to ignore), but couldn't get into the building without having a police escort through a human chain of protestors blocking the gate.  There's nothing worse for your social life than becoming that guy.

But protests are expected to have some spillover effects into the uninvolved.  We're comfortable with that.  We understand that part of the point of the protests is to get the agnostics or lukewarm among us to call the powers that be and ask for change.  ""I'm okay with paying $200 more a year in room and board if it means switching from Pepsi to Coke, if that's what it takes to stop these protests (and besides, the protestors are probably morally on the right side).""  Stuff like that.  Fine.

But OWS doesn't have that option.  And to make matters worse, OWS doesn't have an end-game either.

* * * 

Let's use the Pepsi/Burma protest.  The protestors wanted the Pepsi out of Burma.  That's the goal.  The strategy:  get the university dropping Pepsi as a vendor.   The tactics: Make life miserable for administrators (and others) until they got their way -- specifically, with hours-long protests, sit-ins, and human walls.  

OWS lacks this.  Terribly.  Because there's no ""ask,"" there's also no end.  Because the tactic is occupation, there's also no break.  People like me can't really do anything to help the cause other than engage in civil disobedience, protesting if not camping out in Zuccotti Park, which I'm not going to do.  I'm lukewarm to their message -- I want to support it in small parts, but not in the whole, and not in the ways available.

Unfortunately, I'm still a victim of the protests.  I live in NYC.  They march outside my office (and I'm not in the Financial District), occupy the subways, choke traffic over the Brooklyn Bridge.  I'd write or call my representatives but *they* aren't even the subject of the protests.  They're all Democrats and even though the OWS crowd isn't really Democrats, let's face it, it leans heavily that way.  And regardless, there's nothing for me to call them *about*.

That's the other problem with OWS: there's no end.  No way for the powers to be to capitulate.  If Vikram Pandit resigns from Citibank, so what?  Does that end the protests?  No way.

In fact, there's no end.

We get that you're angry.  Really.  We're angry too, for the same reasons.  We've been laid off and unemployed.  We have lots of student debt and no job security.  Our 401ks are wiped out.  Our houses are underwater.  We're overqualified for jobs that don't pay us enough to maintain our pre-recession lifestyle and it doesn't really matter because the employers don't hire us anyway (overqualified, remember)?  Etc.  We get it. 

And we'd help you -- but we can't.  You haven't given us a way.  Instead, you've made our commutes longer.  You've woken up our napping children, interrupted our few hours at home with our significant others and families.  You've turned our peaceful lunch escape into a cesspool of anger.  We want you gone.

And again, we'd gladly help you out to get you to leave.  What's the equivalent of telling the University President to switch to Coke, and to hell with the $200?  We'll do it.  After all, that's the tactics you've chosen.  And they work.  We capitulate in your favor: asking those in power to do your bidding in order to shut you up.  

But that option not being there, we still ask those in power to make you go away.  Again, we equivocate.  Instead of giving up that $200, we give up a bit of our liberty -- and a lot of yours -- by accepting police action.  Midnight raids on Zuccotti Park, clearing it out?  No problem.  You gave us no choice.

That's what's happening.  When Zuccotti was cleared out, people I've known forever -- people who are yellow dog Democrats and ACLU members -- were happy that Zuccotti got cleared out by the police.  There was no other choice.

* * *

Unfortunately, it's very hard to figure out where the line is.  Police throwing civil disobedient protestors to the ground to put zip cuffs on them?  That's OK for some.  Tasers?  Still OK, maybe?  Pepper spray?  What about pepper spray at point blank range?  We've crossed the line, clearly, but where -- that's unclear.  

And it's also very hard to figure out who is wrong here.  Not in the UC-Davis case -- that's clear -- but in the Wall Street/Zuccotti one.  I mean, the protestors haven't given us a way to get them to go away peacefully -- is arresting them okay?  

I'm angry too, but how can I support this?"	t5_2s6h3	True
1370879899.0	1g1ubg	Three quotes from the Federalist Papers that I found interesting in light of recent NSA/FBI events	uspatentspending	79	4	14	"One from James Madison:
&gt;If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself. A dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on the government; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions.

Two from Alexander Hamilton:
&gt;On the other hand, it will be equally forgotten that the vigor of government is essential to the security of liberty; that, in the contemplation of a sound and well-informed judgment, their interest can never be separated; and that a dangerous ambition more often lurks behind the specious mask of zeal for the rights of the people than under the forbidden appearance of zeal for the firmness and efficiency of government. History will teach us that the former has been found a much more certain road to the introduction of despotism than the latter, and that of those men who have overturned the liberties of republics, the greatest number have begun their career by paying an obsequious court to the people; commencing demagogues, and ending tyrants.

&gt;Safety from external danger is the most powerful director of national conduct. Even the ardent love of liberty will, after a time, give way to its dictates. The violent destruction of life and property incident to war, the continual effort and alarm attendant on a state of continual danger, will compel nations the most attached to liberty to resort for repose and security to institutions which have a tendency to destroy their civil and political rights. To be more safe, they at length become willing to run the risk of being less free.

I read these quotes and immediately ordered three books on the Constitution, the Federalist Papers, and the Anti-Federalist papers.  What struck me in these quotes is the timelessness of the ideas and the relevance to our current situations.  Also, I'm shocked at how insightful, measured, and balanced these ideas, when taken together, really are."	t5_2s6h3	True

1343236281.0	x51g0	Six reasons in three days why I cannot get legitimate conservative viewpoints from FOX News [x-post]	Asteroidea	95	33	50	"**1)**[Hyperbole &amp; hypocrisy](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2012/07/23/media-must-stop-falsely-accusing-tea-party-every-time-tragegy-strikes/) - calling down “the media” for one man’s comments and using it as a platform to bring up entirely unrelated incidents from separate news agencies, when their own organization has (arguably) one of the [worst track records of any news agency.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News_Channel_controversies)

 

**2)**[False premises](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2012/07/24/small-business-owner-to-obama-owe-us/)- the basis of the entire article stems from the assertion that Obama thinks and/or said that small business owners “owe credit to government,” when that was never stated (see point 6).

 
**3)**[Highly inflammatory writing](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2012/07/24/how-obama-has-stealthily-dismantled-america-immigration-enforcement-laws/)- Even with stories that have understandable points or concerns, the rhetoric contributes absolutely nothing to the discussion, and polarizes the issue far beyond what is necessary.  Furthermore, the line between “Opinion” pieces (not to mention opinion personalities like O’Reilly, Hannity, Beck, etc.) and “real” journalism is almost impossible to distinguish with the amount of editorializing that goes into their articles.

 

**4)**[Lack of perspective](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/07/24/senate-intelligence-committee-head-regrets-speculating-about-leaks/)- How Romney (or FOX) can say that leaks from this administration are a “national security crisis”, when the Obama administration has the record it does with, say, [whistleblowers](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/apr/11/obama-administration-whistleblowers-paul-harris?CMP=twt_gu) or even [targeted assassinations of American citizens](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?pagewanted=all) is beyond comprehension; in many respects, Obama’s administration is equally if not more hawkish than Bush’s was.

 
**5)**[Cognitive dissonance](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/07/25/senate-braces-for-symbolic-showdown-on-tax-cuts/)- There is one sentence buried in the middle of the deficit article that states “The clash in the Senate underscored how little the partisan tax-cutting duel had to do with actually passing a law this year. If anything, it highlighted how entrenched both parties' views were,” but spends the majority of the article making Democrats out to be obstructionists while thoroughly ignoring the fact that the (Republican-controlled) House has wasted time on [33 different votes](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/07/13/13-reasons-why-this-is-the-worst-congress-ever/) to repeal the health care law when they know it has absolutely 0% chance of succeeding.

 

**6)**[Misinterpretation of verifiable facts](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/07/24/obama-claims-romney-twisted-his-words-on-didnt-build-that/)- Even after actually citing the relevant portion of the speech, the article then proceeds to focus on quoting and supporting Romney in misinterpreting [Obama’s speech](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/07/13/remarks-president-campaign-event-roanoke-virginia) (either ignorantly or deliberately), when the entire tone ran along the lines of 

&gt;*“They [Romney and Republican allies] think that the economy grows from the top down*… I just want to point out that we tried their theory for almost 10 years, and here’s what it got us:  We got the slowest job growth in decades.  We got deficits as far as the eye can see.  Your incomes and your wages didn’t go up.  And it culminated in a crisis because there weren’t enough regulations on Wall Street and they could make reckless bets with other people’s money that resulted in this financial crisis, and you had to foot the bill.  *So that’s where their theory turned out.  Now, we don’t need more top-down economics.  I’ve got a different view.  I believe that the way you grow the economy is from the middle out.  I believe that you grow the economy from the bottom up.*  I believe that when working people are doing well, the country does well.   I believe in fighting for the middle class because if they’re prospering, all of us will prosper.  … *So we say to ourselves,* ever since the founding of this country, you know what, *there are some things we do better together.*  That’s how we funded the GI Bill.  That’s how we created the middle class.  That’s how we built the Golden Gate Bridge or the Hoover Dam.  That’s how we invented the Internet.  That’s how we sent a man to the moon.  *We rise or fall together as one nation and as one people.*"	t5_2s6h3	True

I found the Obama vs. Romney Politifact comparison interesting, but realized it could be an unfair comparison, as Obama likely has many quotes from the past four years that are not campaign-related. So I went through Politifact and tallied up the numbers from *only the analyses in 2012*.

The idea was that, hopefully, more of the 2012 quotes are campaign-focused, making the comparison more valid. The above link shows a bar chart of the resulting counts.

Should you consider this the end of the story? Of course not! I didn't look into *what* those quotations were. Maybe one candidate was caught lying many times about the color of his pen, while the other was caught lying once about whether or not he has ever committed genocide. I exaggerate, but you get my point.

He is loved some, most notably in /r/obama of course. But he is hated by subreddits such as /r/sopa, /r/ronpaul, and also hated by freedom fighting activists and conspiracy theorists alike. In other words, he happens to be a president you either love or you hate. Which brings me here to ask you guys this.

How do you guys think Obama did as president so far? Do you guys think he will improve if he gets a second term?

In my opinion, I don't think obama is the best president we've ever had, nor is the worst. But he is certainly by no means a ""dictator"" like the activist groups and conspiracy theorists say he is. I also do at least appreciate what he has done in his first term so far. Like saving our economy from going into a 2nd great depression, and bringing our troops home from Iraq. Overall, I think Obama is an ok president, and I hope to see him improve if he gets a second term."	t5_2s6h3	True

First of all, I am a libertarian conservative and a US Marine, so I'm coming at this from that point of view.

A lot has been said about the varied Republican plans to try and solve the debt crisis. A lot of liberals don't like it and are defending cuts to entitlement programs at all cost. I think we can all agree that we have to do something about the debt, and that current spending, both now and under Bush, is unsustainable. However, the only liberal solution I have yet to hear is to raise taxes and cut loopholes. Even if we did this, though, no solution to the debt is in sight. Even if tax rates were raised to confiscatory levels (ie, taking 100% of income), government revenue would only increase in the hundreds of billions, nowhere near the 14 trillion we are in debt now. And obviously confiscatory tax rates are ludicrous, even for the most left-wing.

Another thing I hear a lot is to end the wars and military adventurism. While its true that a third of the federal budget goes toward the military, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are nothing more than a drop in the bucket for all of that (the Congressional Budget Office estimated the cost of Iraq at about $750 billion). I do want to say that even as a Marine, I am okay with the Pentagon being cut. Money is money, whether it goes to my paycheck or an old person's medicare. Anyway, ending the wars would do little to solve the debt.

What I'd like to hear is what liberals would do to solve the debt crisis. If you could do whatever you wanted, how would you bring us back from the brink?

EDIT- I've been asked by a couple people to give my ideas instead of just asking for yours'. So I'll repost this up here. My solution would be to move the entitlement programs to the states, similar to what Clinton did with welfare in the 90's. Allow them to tailor the program to their needs. Shift to a flat tax between 15-20% across the board, which studies say would actually raise revenue. This would end all corporate loopholes, since they would just pay the flat tax rate, same as an individual. With that in mind, we could actually scale back a lot of the IRS since we'd simplify the tax code. And cut all discretionary spending, including military, by 10-25%. It would take a while, but we could move back from the brink."	t5_2s6h3	True

First off, thank all of you guys for subscribing and contributing here. I think this is one of the best subreddits around, and it's all because of the culture that you guys have instilled.  
That being said, I would just like to take a moment to remind everyone the purpose of the subreddit: This subreddit is for the moderate discussion of politics, not necessarily discussion of the politics of moderates. Moderates are, of course, more than welcome, but so are libertarians, socialists, facists, anarchists, and mpeople from everywhere on the political spectrum.  
Why is that? Well, here in [/r/moderatepolitics](/r/moderatepolitics), we assume that everyone has a rational reason for subscribing to a particular ideology, *especially* if they have taken the time to find a fairly small subreddit and contribute. With that in mind, there is something to be learned from everyone, even  if it's just a refinement on why, exactly, you disagree with them. This is what a large part of the subscriber base in other political subreddits seem to not understand. When you downvote someone in the comments, you are, in effect, voting to censure their opinion, which is not something that we believe in here.  
To be clear: downvoting in the comments should be reserved for when someone is factually incorrect and you can provide a source that proves so, someone who is clearly trolling, or someone who is aggressive with their rhetoric. There is absolutely no reason to be aggressive or curse at someone else here.

His decision to take on a clearly inexperience VP for votes and a lot of the comments he made during that time made me genuinely think he had no clue how to handle a problem non-military related.

That being said, one thing you can't hold against Romney is his ability to turn around a struggling business. Maybe he needs to let people go to make that happen and I know generally liberal voters aren't thrilled about that. 

But does anyone have an idea of what exactly Romney's plan is for America given all the criticisms he's been leveling about Obama's administration? For instance, if he's for cutting taxes; whose taxes is he cutting, and what does he believe the impact will be for working class Americans?

Is there any objectivity here? or is it simply a matter of opinion of who is ""right""?

1. What exactly are the teachers' demands? I hear about standarized tests and benefits, but I'm not clear on the specifics.

2. Are the teachers' demands unreasonable? Do Chicago teachers have better or worse working conditions than other areas? Do they make more money than other areas?

Meanwhile, the Israelis bomb Gaza/West Bank/Lebanon and kill innocent people, the PLO/Hezbollah fires rockets into Israel and kills/scares innocent people, and the cycle of violence continues intractably. Both sides are to blame.

I honestly don't understand where American interests come into play here. There's dozens of shitty little conflicts all around the world, yet this one receives all the attention, money, and provokes the strongest reactions. There's no reason for us to be giving money or weapons to anyone in this conflict.

EDIT: I still haven't read any good reasoning yet. I know more about the history but I can tell from the comments that everybody has their own version of the history. The most compelling argument I've heard is that we don't want a large scale war threatening our oil interests in the Middle East. This is true, but couldn't we get our oil from the Saudis and Iraqis?

They appear to have been bitten by the Fox bug, and especially in this election cycle they've been eating up emotional rhetoric like Garfield on lasagna.


The worst part of it all is that every time I attempt to offer an explanation for something they detest or find ridiculous, they'll either dismiss the reality of it as a one-off, or they'll counter that *""it's just what they want you to think""*.  


For example, recently they just went to see a particularly alarmist new ""documentary"" concerning the President and his apparent ""communist ties"", as well as his goal of ""sending the US back into the third world"".  The next time I saw them, i found myself knee-deep in a one-sided conversation about all the incredible revelations they had learned from this new film.  Naturally, I immediately found a short article with a few fact checks on some of the major points of the ""documentary"" and offered some explanations for, for example, *why* the White House returned a bust of Winston Churchill to England (it was on loan and scheduled to be returned anyway), to explain that no, it was not part of a grand conspiracy to end our alliance with the UK. 


Now, I'm used to hearing the typical far-right talking points and fear-mongering, but their reaction to my most recent attempt at objectivity was what really scared me.


For the first time in my life, I presented reasonable **facts** to otherwise-normally-functioning human beings and they basically chose to ignore them in favor of their own reality.

1326202636.0	oassy	A couple of questions from across the pond.	AGPO	38	4	67	"Hi /r/moderatepolitics,

I have to say it's really refreshing here compared to /r/politics. I'm an international relations student from the UK who has studied a little about U.S. politics, which is pretty radically different to our own. There's a fair few things you do which seem pretty alien to us, so in the spirit of this subreddit, I was wondering if I could ask a few honest questions about the mentality of U.S. politics.

**1. Do you consider your politics to be particularly right wing?**
It goes without saying that, in policy even terms, the Democrats would be right out on the far right of most mainstream Western European politics. Issues like universal healthcare and employment rights aren't even an issue for us. What qualifies as centerist or moderate for us is obviously very different to you. Do we just come across as a buch of raving lefties, do you generally think of yourselves as a right of centre country, or do most Americans not give a damn about the rest of the world's politics?

**2. Could you explain your relationship with your constitution?**
I can't speak for everyone, but most of my fellow students and academics see the aparent U.S. view of your constitution as a tad strange. Quite often from an outsiders point of view the debate seems to centre around what is constitutional rather than what is necessarily best for the country. Is this something you would agree with and if so why is it the case?

**3. Do you like the seperation of powers?**
Again from an outsider's perspective it seems to be incredibly frustrating model. Over here we have a parliamentary model, where the government is drawn from the legislature. The notion that you could have an executive who would be unable to govern because they did not have the confidence of the legislature seems crazy, as it raises all sorts of questions about mandate. In general do you find the Presidential system to be a preferable one? Do you think it needs reform or would you prefer a legislative system?

I hope nobody is offended by any of these questions, they were asked in an open spirit of enquiry.

**EDIT: Wow thanks for all your thorough and insightful responses. The standard of discussion here is sooooo much higher than in /r/politics. I feel like I'm actually learning rather than being bombarded with partisan vitriol!**"	t5_2s6h3	True

1341095815.0	vux6e	"The ""critical thinking"" plank in the 2012 Texas Republican Party platform"	MrPattywagon	54	23	41	"For context, posts lambasting the plank below for attacking critical thinking have frontpaged r/politics multiple times.

&gt;Knowledge-Based Education – We oppose the teaching of Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) (values clarification), critical thinking skills and similar programs **that** are simply a relabeling of Outcome-Based Education (OBE) (mastery learning) **which** focus on behavior modification and have the purpose of challenging the student’s fixed beliefs and undermining parental authority.

Emphasis mine.

""that"" introduces a restrictive relative clause. A restrictive relative clause restricts or limits the noun it modifies and helps to specify the particular object that the noun refers to.
 
""which"" also introduces a relative clause. Normally, when ""which"" introduces a relative clause, the relative clause is unrestrictive. Unrestrictive relative clauses are preceded by commas and merely elaborate on the content of the modified noun. But this ""which"" clause does not have a comma preceding the pronoun. It is a restrictive relative clause and limits the noun it modifies.
 
In the sentence ""We oppose the teaching of Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) (values clarification), critical thinking skills and similar programs that {PREDICATE of relative clause 1} which {PREDICATE of relative clause 2},"" the noun phrase that includes ""critical thinking skills"" is modified by the two relative clauses that follow it. These clauses limit the possible references of the noun phrase to objects which meet the restrictions.
 
Thus, the plank above does not state that the Republican Party of Texas opposes critical thinking skills generally or their being taught in schools. The plank expresses opposition to behavior modification and value adjustment under the *guise* of teaching general critical thinking skills. A book report on Heather Has Two Mommies or a post-reading discussion in which children are asked ""What's so different about loving another boy/girl/Teletubby?"", to be frank, has shit to do with critical thinking. The Texas GOP platform includes this plank to address these kinds of lessons, which - though they obviously encourage students to reflect on social institutions - are intended to *change their minds* on specific cultural issues.
 
The irony is that critical thinking would help us better understand the meaning of this plank. Too bad Texas can't teach it right?

**tl;dr**: Republicans don't oppose critical thinking. They oppose teachers convincing students that their parents' values are wrong.

controversy in the Atheism forum.  Not a very 
smart thing to do."	Warlizard	57	23	53	"Since I hear about how democratic we are all the time, how majority rules, and how everyone's opinion matters equally, I'm pretty irritated that one person has so much influence over an entire town.

Damon's parents threw him out.  The town hates him.  His school hates him.  But he's being held up as a heroic icon, someone who is to be admired.  Paypal donation links are being spammed, facebook pages are being flooded, but at the end of the day, the school wanted to do exactly what they'd been doing for decades -- have a simple prayer at graduation.  

One person didn't like it.  One.  And the thing that kills me is that he's someone that most of the people here wouldn't have even spoken to if he'd been in their school.  

As it happens, I don't believe in God, haven't for a few decades, but I also believe that when 99.99% of a group wants to do something, meh, let it happen.  No one was being tortured, no one's rights were being crushed.  No one was being raped.  If some kid had stood up against separate drinking fountains for black kids, I'd be donating myself, but for this?

But somehow, he's a hero.  What doesn't seem clear to the angry masses is that we have to actually *live* in society.  I have the advantage of having been around for more than four decades and my perspective is different than most high-schoolers.

When I was growing up, prayers in school were common.  As I foolishly noted in my post, Congress opens their sessions with a prayer and it has been upheld by the Supreme Court as contstitutional.  So how is that different than a prayer at graduation.  

I'm so tired of hearing ""Separation of Church and State"" used to completely excise any mention of Christianity from every aspect of government.

As I'm sure many of you have also read up on this, I'm not going to go into the arguments, but fundamentally, the Founders seemed to believe that it wasn't the government's place to create laws regarding the creation of a religious state.  I fully agree with this.  Who wants a state church?  But I can't find anyplace where the intent was to make sure that nothing regarding anything religious was mentioned anywhere related to government.

So when a school wants to have a prayer and this kid threatens to go to the ACLU, how does that link up to the prohibition of establishing a state religion?

If the ACLU were as diligent at protecting 2nd amendment rights as they are prosecuting schools for having a 10 Commandments plaque, there'd be almost no gun laws at all.

MrDNL	44	17	63	"I wrote this (with a different first sentence) [as a comment to an /r/AskReddit question](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/kxt36/reddit_do_you_guys_think_that_occupy_wall_street/c2o5drs), but wanted to share here.  Would love your thoughts, because I (obviously) think I'm right.

***

They want to blame President Obama for violating the promise he made to those who voted for him -- but they're too afraid to do so, and perhaps rightfully so.

Wall Street trembled when President Obama was elected.  The DJIA -- which is not a good indicator of the economy as a whole, but is a great indicator of the health of the banking industry -- tumbled for days after he was elected.  Obama, the populist candidate, was not very likely to continue their bailouts.  Instead, it was windfall taxes on the horizon.  Bad news for banks.

But of course, that didn't happen.  It didn't happen because President Obama lacked the courage to do it after pushing through his health care agenda.  It didn't happen the GOP-controlled Senate is uncompromising.  It didn't happen because the banks threw millions at lobbyists etc. in hopes of preventing it.  It didn't happen because many economists thought that the problem was a liquidity crisis, which requires strong banks to fix.  It didn't happen for a bundle of reasons.  

Republicans are typically in two or three camps.  The first one -- Perry/Palin/Bachmann one -- don't really give a rat's ass about the economy.  They trot out the belief that the banks aren't the problem, but rather, Federal spending is, but really, they don't care about spending.  They'll spend on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan (and if it were GWB in the White House, Libya too); on rounding up immigrants and sticking them on a boat; and on anything else which pushes their social agenda.  They'd bail out banks if it were politically prudent -- it just isn't right now. But they want to cut NPR because it's ""too expensive.""  Garbage.

The second one -- the Paul/Johnson camp -- is honestly anti-spending, and wouldn't have bailed out banks, *even if it were the right move*.  The ideology is low taxes, low spending. They aren't in the bank's pocket, but come off as such because their ideology would allow for a rampant, unchecked banking system.

(Who knows where Mitt Romney sits; only the wind, I'd say, knows for sure.)

The problem for the protestors is simple: they want to point the finger at President Obama and the Democratic leadership -- but they can't, because the GOP alternatives are worse.  They want to be able to say, hey, President Obama, when we voted for you, when we donated to your campaign, when we were the grassroots amplifiers which got you elected, we did so because you promised us you'd change things.  [Hope](http://i.imgur.com/EK0rp.jpg).  [Change we can believe in](http://www.amazon.com/Change-We-Can-Believe-Americas/dp/0307460452). Can we get there? [Yes we can](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjXyqcx-mYY).  How? He asked us to [believe in our ability to bring change](http://www.flickr.com/photos/smoovey/3003536176/), with him as the vessel.

And he failed.

And that's what the protestors want to say.  They want to say ""[Didn't you promise us an end to Iraq and Afghanistan?](http://media21.onsugar.com/files/2011/09/39/1/301/3019466/wallstreet4/i/Occupy-Wall-Street-Protests.jpg),"" for example, but they can't, because they know if they start pushing at Obama, he'll weaken, and they do not want to help Rick Perry become the next inhabitant of the White House.  So instead, they find a scapegoat: [Wall Street](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3ASeptember_23_Occupy_Wall_Street_2011_Shankbone_3.JPG) and [big corporations](http://www.brooklynstreetart.com/theblog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/brooklyn-street-art-occupy-wall-street-copy-right-jaime-rojo-09-22-11-web-7.JPG). 

It's not the banks fault here -- at least, no more than anyone else's.  And if anything, at least the banks are being honest in their self-servicing acts -- no one among them claims that they're doing anything more than rent seeking.  I do not think you can say that for our politicians.

Since the clever editing at [insert media outlet] have totally skewed their highlight reel editing to favor the zings from their favorite candidates, I wanted to ask you guys who you thought won. And maybe why you thought that.

So reddit: who won the battle of the GOP in Iowa last night?

Edit: Reposted because people were totally off topic. If you don't care or didn't watch, or think that there is nothing possibly relevant about the GOP, why would you respond to this?

Anyone actually watch it for the educational purposes, or because they care about where likely nearly half of the presidential ballots are going to be cast? Anyone have an opinion on who won the debate?

Wouldn't simply limiting deduction to a reasonable amount (is $50,000 reasonable) make it so even with the maximum deductions someone making $1,000,000 would still pay 35% on $950,000. That seems more effective than raising their rate to 39% and then letting them get as many deductions as possible. According to my math if they have more than $150,000 in deductions the two numbers would be roughly equal.  
I'm curious if anyone knows the average deductions at upper income levels. This would be even more effective at much wealthier incomes that get hundreds of thousands of deductions per year. It seems that it would be more effective actually. "	t5_2s6h3	True

As a percent of GDP:

- Net interest is lower now than it was during the '80s and '90s, though it is projected to rise over the next four years.

- Defense spending is higher now than in most of the '90s and '00s but lower than in the '80s and is projected to fall over the next four years.

- Social Security spending is about half a percent of GDP more now than it was in 1977 and is projected to stay about there over the next four years.

- Income security (e.g. unemployment insurance, food stamps) spending spiked during the recession but has already begun declining and is projected to return to normal levels over the next four years.

- The most consistent increases appear to be in medical spending, with Medicare spending going from about 1.0% of GDP in 1977 to about 3.1% in 2012 and other health spending going from about 0.9% to about 2.4%. Medicare spending is projected to remain steady over the next four years while other health spending is projected to increase."	t5_2s6h3	True

Obama will have a Republican house for sure.  Romney will likely have a Democrat run Senate.  (EDIT, current odds are 52-48 in favor of the Democrats).

If Obama wins, he'll ask for the Bush tax cuts to be made permanent for the middle and lower class and let the upper run out.  If the Republicans balk, he'll call their bluff and let them all run out, and then introduce a middle and lower tax cut that the Republicans can try and commit political suicide opposing.  I imagine it will go through.

Romney is elected.  He tries and re-instate all of them?  The Senate won't have it.   They'll only re-instate the lower end.   He lets them expire and tries to pass his whole program?  The Senate states they'll only do the lower end.  

Or maybe he's able to pass the huge tax cut plan, but doesn't get the deduction bucket of 17k passed?  Can we imagine that the Senate might allow that?

1350459148.0	11mc7h	Dissecting the battle of words about the Libya attack  during the Presidential Debate	DV1312	30	6	15	"Welcome to the Word Battles World Series!

Now, going into the debate, we knew full well that the Republicans had already heavily criticized Obama for not calling this a terrorist attack for two weeks when they already knew what was going on. There's definitely some merit to this criticism. Romney has a clear lead on facts going into this.

Here's where we should start to look at what happened at the debate itself.

Romney makes his initial argument about the attack on the consulate

&gt;ROMNEY: And there was no demonstration involved. **It was a terrorist attack and it took a long time for that to be told to the American people**. Whether there was some misleading, or instead whether we just didn’t know what happened, you have to ask yourself why didn’t we know five days later when the ambassador to the United Nations went on TV to say that this was a demonstration. How could we have not known?

&gt;But I find more troubling than this, that on — on the day following the assassination of the United States ambassador, the first time that’s happened since 1979, when we have four Americans killed there, when apparently we didn’t know what happened, that the president, the day after that happened, flies to Las Vegas for a political fund-raiser, then the next day to Colorado for another event, other political event.
[...] We’ve read their [the eyewitnesses] accounts now about what happened. It was very clear this was not a demonstration. This was an attack by terrorists.

Now first of all, Romney steps into two landmines for directly insinuating the administration mislead the American public and for tying this to fundraisers in Las Vegas and Colorado (it was already obvious when he said it that Obama could strike back at him for politicizing this). He could have easily said they withheld that information which sounds way more reasonable and he probably should have dropped that whole second part. But we have something to note here that becomes more important later on:

Romney's  initial argument is based on the fact that the remarks of the UN ambassador five days after the attack made no mention of a terrorist attack - when it was already widely known in the administration to be one. I think this was the talking point that was most important for his team in such a segment. The problem is that he fires it first and then changes it into the criticism that the president didn't know what was going on the day *after* the attack happened (so he could make his jab about Obama attending foundraisers). 

But because he brings up that specific day, it's now getting easier for Obama to get a comeback on this - since he has a rebuttal that has nothing to do with anything *but* the day after the attack...

&gt;OBAMA:The day after the attack, governor, I stood in the Rose Garden and I told the American people in the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened. That this was an *act of terror* and I also said that we’re going to hunt down those who committed this crime.

This is basically exactly what Obama said in that Rose Garden speech. And he truthfully, according to the transcript from that day, brings up the term ""acts of terror"". What he said:

&gt; [...] No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for.

Obama has changed the topic from Romneys initial criticism (the ambassador not saying it was a terrorist attack but a violent demonstration, two weeks of misinformation) to the fact that he said something on the day after the attack that was very very similar to what Romney wanted to hear from the administration in the following days. He kind of refutes the point of not knowing what was going on in the direct aftermath of the attack, too.

Following that, he can of course fire out of all cylinders at the afore mentioned landmines to bring them to explosion. That was way too easy and Romney should have phrased it better. 

&gt;OBAMA And then a few days later, I was there greeting the caskets coming into Andrews Air Force Base [...] [The suggestion] anybody on my team would play politics or mislead when we’ve lost four of our own, governor, is offensive. That’s not what we do. That’s not what I do as president, that’s not what I do as Commander in Chief.

The way he phrases the last sentence in negatives conjures up a mental image that it is *exactly* what Mitt Romney *would* do if *he* were president. It's like Reagan *not* holding his youth and inexperience against his opponent.

Now, this was excellent stuff. Obama worded it perfectly and delivered it with the commanding voice of an actual Commander in Chief. There was actual outrage in his voice, too. He's the president and *that guy* is only pretending to be.

The question is if Mitt Romney still wants to drive his real talking point home which he already botched himself in the initial remarks by not keeping it simple. Can Romney keep his cool after what Obama just did? Is there even a way to come back from such a presidential scolding? He decides to try.

&gt;ROMNEY: I — I think interesting the president just said something which — which is that on the day after the attack he went into the Rose Garden and said that this was an act of terror.

He voluntarily choses to attack him on the Rose Garden speech, which he is clearly not prepared for. This is a really bad decision because he's getting down into semantics when he could finally attack him on the broader picture of two weeks with wrong informations. Now he has to argue against a speech he hasn't memorized and the *acts of terror*, a term that didn't came from him. He's not attacking the president anymore, he's only reacting to what he said. 

&gt; OBAMA: That’s what I said.

Obama defends the truth. He's right on what *he* has said. So Romney repeats himself...

&gt;ROMNEY: You said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack, it was an act of terror.

and finally finds back on track (kind of)

&gt;ROMNEY: It was not a spontaneous demonstration, is that what you’re saying?

That's his initial point, but he's phrasing it badly again.

Now comes Obama's catchphrase: 

&gt;OBAMA: Please proceed governor.

Now, he could have also said that he made no remarks about a violent demonstration in the Rose Garden speech. He actually didn't, the language in it was much more broadly. But that would have taken it too far, nobody would believe him *even though it's true*. So Romney has to hang himself if he wants to. He has to bet that Romney can't recover. And he plays the right hand with that. Romney is baffled by Obama's answer and mushes the two topics together. Obama spun him around - he introduces the President's *act of terror* into his own prepared debate argument:

&gt;ROMNEY: I want to make sure we get that for the record because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.

&gt;OBAMA: Get the transcript.

That Crowley now factchecks this whole thing live during the debate is something neither of them could have anticipated. So it comes down to a buzzer game. She says it very silently and it's hard to hear...

CROWLEY: It — it — it — he did in fact, sir. So let me — let me call it an act of terror…

DING DING DING! Obama is fast as lightning. 

OBAMA: Can you say that a little louder, Candy?

Two seconds to improvise that *someone else* could drive this whole thing home for him. Impressive.

&gt;CROWLEY: He — he did call it an act of terror. 

This is the part that sticks. Obama made a clear argument that is now backed up by the debate moderator. That Romney actually had a way better case on this one based on the facts is completely unimportant by now. Crowley tries to acknowledge that Romney is actually in the right here:

&gt;CROWLEY: It did as well take — it did as well take two weeks or so for the whole idea there being a riot out there about this tape to come out. You are correct about that.
ROMNEY: This — the administration — the administration indicated this was a reaction to a video and was a spontaneous reaction.
CROWLEY: It did.

But for the viewer this gets drowned out by spontaneous applause (!) and on top of that it is phrased incomprehensibly. Romney tries to get back on message, Crowley agrees with his point. The applause dies down.

&gt;ROMNEY: It took them a long time to say this was a terrorist act by a terrorist group. And to suggest — am I incorrect in that regard, on Sunday, the — your secretary –

Romney is off the rails, he get's that first sentence out but doesn't know anymore what to do with it. It's buzzer time again.

&gt;OBAMA: Candy?

DING DING DING. The president stands up and walks over to Romney and Crowley to stop this from gaining any new traction.

&gt;ROMNEY: Excuse me. The ambassador of the United Nations went on the Sunday television shows and spoke about how –  
OBAMA: Candy, I’m –  
ROMNEY: — this was a spontaneous –  
CROWLEY: Mr. President, let me –  
OBAMA: I’m happy to have a longer conversation –  
CROWLEY: I know you –  
OBAMA: — about foreign policy.  
CROWLEY: Absolutely. But I want to — I want to move you on and also –  
OBAMA: OK. I’m happy to do that, too.  
CROWLEY: — the transcripts and –  
OBAMA: I just want to make sure that –  
CROWLEY: — figure out what we –  
OBAMA: — all of these wonderful folks are going to have a chance to get some of their questions answered.  

Assert some presidential authority. Keep interrupting until Crowley simply stops and moves on. And it works. He walks away as a winner in this price fight although he was a flyweight and Romney a heavyweight champion based on the facts. Romney fucks up his own argument but more important for Obama's victory is his own versatility and reaction speed.

This concludes a wonderful battle of words. Tune in next time when Joe Biden will stumble drunkenly onto the debate floor, invokes Article Four of the Twenty Fifth Amendment and declares himself the President of the United States."	t5_2s6h3	True

The Tea Party wants to drastically cut spending and lower taxes. For the most part, they want to either devolve or eliminate entitlement programs. But this isn't an effort to screw over black people. Its because they honestly believe that it is not the place of the government to do that, and they think spending is out of control.

Another I hear a lot, recently repeated by Morgan Freeman, is that they only oppose Obama because he is black. That is ludicrous, if you are a conservative/libertarian, then you are going to oppose Obama because you don't agree with his politics. If Bush was black, I would assume the Democrats would still have opposed his policies.

Can anyone explain, beyond the shock value of playing the race card, why do so many people try to label the Tea Party as racist?"	t5_2s6h3	True

I know lives were lost, billions spent, lives destroyed, ect., but that's unfortunately to be assumed in war. 

What I'm wondering is if the US could be seen as ultimately successful in achieving key victories (assuming these were the actual goals of the invasion:

1. Secure control or at least influence over Iraq's oil reserves

2. Remove an unfriendly government, replace with friendly

3. Reduce reliance on Saudis for oil and regional military real-estate

So, ignoring the talk of bringing freedom to the Iraqi people and removing WMDs, was the United States successful in getting what they wanted?

1325735829.0	o3hi2	On political disagreement, and how to be moderate		22	1	31	"It seems to me that there are three possible types of disagreement which we encounter: the ""is"", the ""ought"", and the ""will"".

The first, the ""is"", is disagreement about the way the world really is. Either evolution happened or it didn't. The Holocaust happened or it didn't. Aliens caused 9/11 or they didn't. On these matters, there's not much room for sensible people to disagree -- all sane people should basically come to the same conclusion about the way the world is, or if there's not enough information should agree to withhold judgement with appropriate levels of skepticism. 

The second, the ""ought"", is open to much more disagreement. You can't deduce an ought from an is, and everybody is entitled to his own opinion but not his own facts. We all have substantially different ideas of the way the world ought to be; for instance, one of the big left-right distinctions is sincerely differing beliefs about how, in an ideal world, we should balance freedom versus equality. Reasonable people may disagree here, and we're unlikely to come, as a society, to agreement at any point in the future. Of course it's also quite easy to observe that most folks have a view of the way the world *ought* to be which just *happens* to be quite self-serving.

The third, the ""will"", is disagreement about what's likely to happen in the future under certain conditions. One group will tell you that if we implement a certain policy then all sorts of good things will happen, while the other will tell you that implementation of policy X will doom us all. Of course as humans we're actually really *terrible* at predicting the future, the future being a horrendously complicated place, and yet folks often seem to talk with a great deal of certainty about what the consequences of a given course of action will be. Unsurprisingly, the courses of action which folks seem to be most certain will lead to good consequences almost always seem to be the ones which just happen to match up with the way they think the world *ought* to be; for instance, Libertarians spend a lot of time talking about how increasing freedom would make the world a better place, and will almost never say ""Actually, more freedom here would have all sorts of negative consequences but we should do it anyway"".

Having distinguished between these three forms of disagreement, what's my point? Well, firstly, I think we should keep the distinction in mind, because folks like to blur the lines between them all the time. But secondly, I think in order to be a sensible and detached political observer we should respect differences in the ""ought"", be skeptical of the certainty of others vis a vis the ""will"", and acknowledge that there's very little room for sensible disagreement on the ""is"". 

We don't need to respect all political opinions equally, because some involve odd views of what ""is"", and hence are just crazy. On the other hand, we should respect that others have genuinely differing views on the ""ought"", and be ready express skepticism whenever anyone claims to know what ""will"" happen under some particular policy proposal.

But on OpenCongress it seems that the offending passage is [this](http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-h1981/text?version=ih&amp;nid=t0:ih:28):

&gt; Retention of Certain Records- A

&gt; computing service shall retain for a 
&gt; period of at least 18 months the 
&gt; temporarily assigned network 
&gt; addresses the service assigns to each 
&gt; account, unless that address is 
&gt; transmitted by radio communication 
&gt; (as defined in section 3 of the 
&gt; Communications Act of 1934).

Is there something I'm missing or does this seem like it has been overblown?  As best as I can tell, it requires ISP's to store IP addresses for 18 months.  Yes, I can see how this will help law enforcement to track down child pornographers.  I don't see how this invades your privacy though.

We saw this perfectly with Romney during the Republican primaries. He was much more conservative during the primaries because he was catering to Republicans only. So we basically saw the candidate that the average or majority Republican wanted.

On the other side you have the Democrats, who pretty similarly, choose a candiate that the average or majority Democrat wants.

So then, you have the national election and it's those 2 candidates. But now, all the voters are mixed together so the average / majority looks a lot different. Republicans don't like the Democrat choice and Democrats don't like the Republican choice. Both candidates try and look more moderate because the election is pretty much decided by a handful of swing voters.

So, that means that there is basically no chance for a moderate to get on the national ticket unless they are a 3rd party candidate and just by default, 90% of Americans never vote for a 3rd party because they think it's a wasted vote.

And that gets us back to the swing voters. Now they're forced to choose a side instead of getting to vote for the candidate they want- someone who isn't Republican or Democrat enough to win the primary, but is probably somewhere in the middle.

Maybe some of the Democrats and Republicans would also prefer someone a bit more to the center. If you take all the swing voters and then a decent portion of each party- you might get a winning majority of the vote.

But this type of thing will never happen because a moderate could never win the Republican or Democratic primary, so year after year, we're all forced into choosing sides. It's unfortunate.

I'm assuming this type of thinking is old hat in terms of US Politics / Moderate discussion, but it's new to me and I'm proud to have arrived on this thought by myself. Anyone care to add or give me some other interesting things to read about it?"	t5_2s6h3	True

1326991220.0	onftb	Is a brokered GOP convention a real possibility?	MrDNL	20	2	11	"I think it is.  

Romney is almost certainly going to have a plurality going into the convention, but getting the majority of delegates (1,144) is going to be tough.  Right now -- and I realize that it's painfully early -- [Romney has 16 of the 38 allocated delegates](http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2012/calculator/), including the two Huntsman delegates, or about 42%.  

In general, these things work themselves out, as early dropouts endorse the front runner, and as the convention nears, the the party rallies around that person.  That could obviously happen here.  But there are a few factors which suggest otherwise:

1) The GOP is very factionalized.  Sarah Palin endorsing Gingrich in South Carolina, Perry tossing his support to Newt while Huntsman endorses Mitt, and the evangelical pow-wow to unite under a candidate not named Romney (or Paul, I guess).  But there's no great leader for the non-Mitt faction.  Santorum is a Catholic and Newt a divorcee.  Until one of them drops out and, Romney will pick up extra votes (and therefore delegates) simply for being the front-running candidate.  But assuming one (Santorum most likely) drops out after Florida and endorses the other, it's basically a two man race.   ([We're already seeing things coming together](http://www.redstate.com/erick/2012/01/19/perry-drops-out-endorses-newt-will-campaign-and-serve/).)

2) In general, factionalization doesn't matter, because when there are two factions, one gets 50%+ and the other doesn't -- and if there are other factions, they drop out early.  But this year, the third faction is Ron Paul, who (a) gets support from voters who are unlikely to support the other two men and (b) has already said he'll stick in the race until someone else has 1,144 delegates pledged.  Paul should get at least 10% of the delegates, meaning that of the 2057 delegates available to Newt and Mitt, one of them has to win 55.6%.  That's not very likely.

So when we get to the convention, Paul can play kingmaker -- but probably won't.  It's not his style.  More likely outcome: Some sort of agreement between the Romney and Gingrich camps.  But chaos is also a possible outcome.  "	t5_2s6h3	True

The so argued ""flipping of coin"" on Christians is just as bad as criticizing the muslim population (and I say this as an agnostic).

1302648379.0	gol6t	Overheard a conversation today between what I assume a Republican and an old lady. Can someone explain to me the actual facts?	noyourstoopid	29	8	43	"I was getting ready to drive today at the driving school, and while I was in the waiting room I heard this what I assume a business suit explaining politics to this elderly, Hispanic secretary. She didn't know much, the conversation was like:

*Man: The bill then goes to the House of Rep., then on to the Senate. The Republicans control the House now so they can block all the terrible bills Obama puts out. Do you understand? If you want low taxes and cut spending, what are you?*

*Hispanic lady: ....?*

*Man: Your a Republican and a Tea Partier, if your a Democrat then what do you want? More taxes and more spending.*

*Hispanic lady: And we don't want that right?*

*Man: What Obama doesn't realize is that discouraging business is the worst thing you can do. When the economy started to go wrong, who was in power? The Democrats.*

He also said something along the lines of Obama discouraging businesses leads to *something* (I don't remember what he said it was, something along the line of taxes.) I'd be inclined to think he would believe taxing businesses would be bad for the economy.

He also quoted the DOWJONES being at 1400-something points in 2007, then it took a tremendous drop (think he said 400 points) and then said ""And who was in power in Congress? The Democrats."" He was very emphatic when he was talking about the stock market, I assume he's involved in business from his the way he talked about it and it seemed he knew what he was talking about.

As I was hearing this, the Independent in me knew at least some of his rhetoric couldn't all be true. Could someone help clarify?

The ideal platform would allow you to provide your credit card info when making the pledge, but it would only charge your card once the threshold is reached. Meanwhile, here's a simple ""honor system"" pledge site I created for Buddy Roemer: http://www.pledgebank.com/HelpBuddy

This pledge allows those who would like to support a candidate, but only if they have a fighting chance, to give the candidate the resources needed for a viable campaign. But they don't risk throwing away their money if sufficient support never materializes. This pledge idea can solve a coordination problem that currently blocks good candidates from breaking through.

This all-or-nothing crowdfunding strategy has already been implemented successfully for non-political purposes by [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/), [Groupon](http://www.groupon.com/about), [StartSomeGood](http://startsomegood.com/), and others.

A) I'm incorrect and Obama/Democrats are spending loads of money, or

1350028281.0	11cv7h	What the foreign policy debate was really all about: Softpower vs. Hardpower.	timothyrds	22	5	6	"The debate between Biden and Ryan on foreign policy was interesting as it highlighted the primary difference between the two camps when it comes to their dealings with other nations.

Biden talked on multiple occasions about how the president has worked to gain ground with our allies, ground that we had presumably lost under Bush. He talked about the nearly global sanctions on Iran and the global efforts to thwart a Libyan dictator. Mr. Biden is correct in pointing out that these stand in stark contrast to President Bush's policies, and Mr. Ryan pointed out the ways they contrast with his and Romney's foreign policy plans.

Essentially, the debate comes down to [softpower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power), or the ability of a nation to use means other than physical force to influence the behavior of others, versus [hardpower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_power), or the use of military or economic means to coerce the behavior of others.

Romney and Ryan are firmly in the hardpower camp, and would like to see a strong military. Ryan discussed the ways military budget cuts could cause us to have a much smaller standing navy which may leave us vulnerable. Ryan was also relatively averse to seeking UN involvement in international issues. This is likely to the UN's reluctance to take swift, decisive action.

Obama and Biden lean more toward the use of softpower to accomplish their foreign policy goals. Biden discussed the global efforts to stop Iran from getting a nuke, and praised the president for the way he has been able to get many more nations to side with us in our dealings with other nations. Biden also talked about how a larger military is less necessary and about how he would not back down from a 2014 removal of troops from Afghanistan.

I don't want to tell anyone where to stand. I just thought you might benefit from a synthesis of the two positions. I realize that the two positions are more complicated than I have painted them, but I feel that if foreign policy is a voting issue, understanding this basic underlying difference in the principles that guide these two candidates in their foreign policy making decisions would be useful."	t5_2s6h3	True
1349562023.0	1127jq	Just a question. Why did California switch from voting to Democrats in 1992? Political party changes, or just demographic ones?	dmstewar	22	6	19	"I'm not too knowledgeable about American politics, but what happened at that point that made the state, which voted for Reagan and Nixon, Ford change to being solid-blue.

I know that the Southern Strategy alienated blacks from voting republican, but they are a small % of California's demos.

The only thing I can think of is the ripple effect of the Southern Strategy affected how Californian and other progressive voters viewed the party as a whole?

Was it actually a state thing and not a reaction to national politics? Did more people move to SF and LA county, which are heavy dem counties? Because I'm pretty sure all of inland California is still rather conservative.

Did LA and SF voters switch parties, or did they just get more immigrants and carry the state? Both?

Is it just California votes the opposite of the south?

It just seems that sacrificing 50+ electoral votes (for a net of 100) was a really bad move if it could have been avoided.

1337616931.0	txo2i	H.R. 4133: United States-Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation Act of 2012 	ConstantEvolution	27	11	12	"Here's a summary of the bill provided by govtrack.us:

    (1) reaffirm the commitment to Israel's security as a Jewish state
    (2) provide Israel with the military capabilities to defend itself and help preserve its qualitative military edge
    (3) expand military and civilian cooperation
    (4) assist in a negotiated settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that results in two states living side by side in peace and security
    (5) encourage Israel's neighbors to recognize Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state. Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should take specified actions to assist in Israel's defense.

I'm posting here because I want to avoid the r/politics strictly ""Fuck Israel"" responses and actually have a discussion about it.

In short it seems to me that this bill is designed to further intertwine the US and Israel with huge amounts of aid and weapons to Israel at the US tax payers expense, all while continuing to enact the apartheid policies against Palestine.

The first three points seem to be just the standard enormous amount of money and weapons aid as well as a guarantee by the US to aid the Israeli's in any of their undertakings, but it's the last two that are the big problems I think. First you have #4 stating that it wishes to establish a two state solution that lives in peace. This is part of a bill that will be providing billions of US dollars in military aid for the Israeli's that is stating that it wants Palestine to live right next to Israel in peace and harmony. I just simply don't believe that Palestine can feel safe and at peace with such a powerful, US aided, (former) enemy next to them.

But I think it's the last point, #5, that will be the kicker and cause the most suffering for the Palestinians. It's this ""right to Israeli legitimacy"" or ""right to exist"" that seems to pop up in every Pro-Israel bill. Now the Palestinians know that the Israeli's are on their land (as established in the Oslo Accords), so ""that they exist"" is a moot point. They can see them existing right next to them. But the RIGHT to exist is something entirely different, and that is something that the Palestinians just will not concede (nor should they in my opinion). Unfortunately for the Palestinian's, my guess is that this will continue to be the stumbling block that continues to provide an excuse to Israel to push for strikes and policies against Palestine.

I also disagree with the way that this bill seems to be sneaking through legislative process without much press and using a ""suspension of the rules"" vote. Then again I don't know much about this process and I would welcome any additional takes on this matter.

Would anyone be in favor of a website that would allow users to submit problems they have with government, after which the community would vote on issues that merit discussion. After discussion (perhaps in a reddit-like format), users could submit proposals for solutions, which, in turn would be voted on by the community. The website would be broken down into local, state, and federal sections, so one could submit a problem within one's town (e.g. poorly thought out school budget), or a problem about the federal government (e.g. how to reduce national debt responsibly). Anyone within the affected level of government would be eligible to vote on ideas, participate in debate, and vote on solutions.

I'm thinking that users could somehow provide a means of proving identity, maybe to add some sort of accountability, particularly so experts or specialists can weigh in and be held accountable for their opinions.

Aside from the benefit of bringing issues into one location, such a channel would solve some of the problems of in-person discussion of issues. Specifically, in ""IRL"" debates, participants generally don't have a way of verifying facts posed by opponents, and often can't offer substantial and meaningful rebuttal. I'm sure you in r/politics have all seen claims totally shut down by the introduction of opposing evidence - I think that a fact-based approach to debate, where so-called 'debaters' could respond to facts and claims as they are made, would be much more effective a strategy than preparing for debates in person.

Reddit, I may have some spare time over the rest of the summer, so, if you would, please pick apart my idea and let me know if you think it's something i should pursue."	t5_2s6h3	True

Now I wonder why do we really need the NRA if we have the 2nd amendment?	stevyjohny	25	12	64	"Like I said. I was walking around the convention with two friends. There was a whole bunch of booths for different things set up. This outdoor convention was really lame compared to previous years. It seemed way too commercialized. I guess it was not that odd that they had an NRA booth set up there. 

There was an elderly man sitting there. He goes, ""Son, are you a member of the NRA?"" I said no. He said, ""Well, what are you waiting for? An invitation? You get a free hat if you sign up!""

OH BOY! I think it costs about 45 dollars a year to join. But for what? I have been a conservative my whole life and I own a gun. My best friend and his wife are card carrying members and so is his dad. However, I am kind of embarrassed because I don't really know what the NRA does. What does the money go to? They champion the 2nd amendment, yet that is what already protects our gun rights. 

Now, I am curious. What does the NRA actually do with all that money they get? I don't think the liberal plot to take away guns in America has worked (if it ever existed). Its obviously failing, but I don't think the NRA has anything to do with it unless I am wrong.

Every damn place on Reddit seems up in arms about the NDAA for 2012, saying it'll allow for indefinite detention of citizens without trial, create a police state, etc.

I have yet to see a part of the bill which allows for indefinite detention of United States citizens without trial. I saw an article by a Glenn Greenwald, and (my parents and) I were dissatisfied by his analysis (he was twisting the grammar of the bill to get the view he wanted).

While those reasons do make some sense, I don't really buy it. There are many other areas of government where overreaching and waste is so much greater, but this seems like such a specific attack on a single agency.

On the liberal side, I have heard that it is a movement to suppress education in minorities who are dependent upon Pell grants and student loans. That seems a bit extreme and conspiratorial. On the other hand, I have heard that it all comes down to reducing funds for government and public workers who are a huge source of union money, which is a huge source of democrat political funding. That makes a little more sense and it has been the cause of other conservative opposition to government programs, but I find it hard to believe this, or at least I don't want to believe that political funding is higher priority than education. 

Does anyone have any more insight or better explanations?

These two insanely reasonable acts have me interested in the possibility that he might throw his hat in the ring next election.
 
The trouble is, his voting record is rather strongly liberal, which means he could get through the democratic primaries only to lose the general election, unless this can be accounted for somehow. He seems likely to appeal to older voters due to his involvement in the Grey Panthers. He's slightly irritating to some on the left due to his tendency towards bipartisanship; one of the Romney campaign talking points involved his cooperation with Paul Ryan on a Medicare bill.

1347128044.0	zkbyr	On what metrics do you judge the president?	fosterlywill	15	3	14	"Hearing the conventions and subsequent spin over the last two weeks, I have been thinking about my own personal beliefs and how they relate to how I judge politicians. Politicos on both sides of the aisle often use dishonest rhetoric to blame things on (or give credit to) the president when he may not actually deserving of the blame (or praise).

I think the President controls three main things in American politics:

1. While the president doesn't not unilaterally make laws, he still drives the political agenda.

2. He nominates judges and other federal appointments.

3. He controls our military.

To elaborate, these are specifics things I **don't** give credit to Obama:

1. Killing Osama bin Laden. It's almost unthinkable that any other president with the same military leadership would not also find and kill bin Laden. Yes, Obama was in power and made ""the call"" but I believe that anyone was capable of doing that.

2. The economy. I believe that John McCain would have also passed a stimulus package to mitigate the effects of the housing crisis, and that unemployment would be comparable to what it is today. The US doesn't control the ECB and the debt of other countries, and it's pretty clear that the European debt crisis is still what causes uncertainty in the markets. I would argue that Angela Merkel currently has more power over the global economy than Obama does.

3. The girdlock in Washington. Regardless of which party controls the presidency, the Senate needs 60 votes to get anything done, and when the houses are controlled by different parties, these problems are exacerbated. Obama can't be blamed for the inaction of congress because congress causes their own problems. Partisanship and political wrangling would cause political inaction regardless of who is president. The president can't magically make both parties work together.

Things I do give credit to Obama:

1. Withdrawl of some troops and our continuing presence in the Middle East. Regardless of what you think of Iraq and Afghanistan, Obama has brought the majority of the troops home, although thousands of ""non-combat"" troops still are stationed in those countries. Obama has direct control over these decisions.

2. The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). Love it or hate it, Obama was the driving force behind the  new health care law. He made the calls and the backroom deals. He got the votes and made it happen. Reid and Pelosi would never have been able to pull this off on their own.

3. The appointment of judges to different courts. The effects of these decisions won't be recognized until years from now, but the decisions of these appointees will be directly credited/blamed to Obama.

So what kinds of issues do you give credit to Obama for? Do you think Romney could be better at ""healing our nation"" or would we still have many of the same problems regardless of our president?

I have some of the following (note: I haven't done actual research on this, this is pure brainstorm)

-Campaign staffers search for polling data to see what issues are trending; if gay marriage issue is trending, will try to get candidate to drudge up on issue.

-Try to go for issues that maintain alignment with the party at whole...want to stay away from stirring up a new issue that the general party may not take a liking to.

-Places that have certain issues more important to them. Auto industry is an important issue in Northern Ohio. Would most assuredly want to play support to that.

I'm not sure what exactly to search for to find some of these answers, or what internet resources that could be helpful, which is why I'm asking here.  If anyone has any input on this it would be greatly appreciated.

1337308962.0	tsoxo	Concerning the US Senate (X-Post from /r/PoliticalDiscussion)	VOLDAMERICA2	15	4	8	"I had a thought tonight while watching a discussion on the evening news about abuse of the filibuster rule in the Senate. It has recently been abused to block most legislation passing through Congress. While originally meant to prolong debate on an issue, it has evolved as a tool for either party to prevent legislation from moving on. Since filibusters aren't measured, the best way to see when they are used to is look at cloture votes(When the Senate by a 2/3rds majority decides to end the filibuster) which can be found [here](http://www.alan.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ezra_klein_cloture_graph.png). 

The filibuster itself is part of the rules of the Senate, which are decided by members of the Senate under Article 1, Section 5, Clause 2: ""Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behaviour, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member."" 

As was pointed out by Ezra Klein already tonight, The Founders disagreed with the idea of having a 2/3rds majority being needed to rule. In Federalist 22, Alexander Hamilton said, ""But its real operation is to embarrass the administration, to destroy the energy of the government, and to substitute the pleasure, caprice, or artifices of an insignificant, turbulent, or corrupt junto, to the regular deliberations and decisions of a respectable majority."" Furthermore, in Federalist 58, James Madison stated, ""In all cases where justice or the general good might require new laws to be passed, or active measures to be pursued, the fundamental principle of free government would be reversed. It would be no longer the majority that would rule: the power would be transferred to the minority""

All of this to me, seems to be part of a larger issue with the system of government in the United States. Politicians on both sides of the aisle always talk about the ""Founders Intent"", and ask: ""What would the Founders have wanted?"" Now generally I tend to think that the Founders--despite some mistakes--mostly had everything right. I agree with James Madison's attacks on direct democracy in Federalist 10, and the general belief of the Founders that republicanism is the best form of government.

So herein lies the question. Knowing that the Founders wanted a more republican and less democratic form of government in the United States because they feared the ""mob rule"" of democracy. And knowing that politics have been broken recently by politicians less worried about fixing issues with the country and more worried about winning their next election., then why don't we simply repeal the 17th Amendment to the Constitution that allows the direct election of Senators. 

Under this system, Senators would still be appointed for 6 years, and 1/3rd of the Senate would be up for ~~reelection~~ reappointment every 2 years. 

Why I think this would be better:
1. It removes half of the legislative power in the Federal Government from politics and ""mob rule."" This same argument is often used to justify appointing Supreme Court Justices. Being separated from politics would prevent PACs, Lobbyists, and other interests form ""buying out"" Senators and influencing their voting decisions. 
2. Their would still be an ""principal/agent"" relationship between Senators and citizens from their home state. Senators would be forced to enact policies that were beneficial in their home state, because they would be appointed by State Legislatures. Also, bills would arrive in the Senate from the House of Representatives, where citizens have more control over their representatives in the Federal Government. This would make the Senate the more deliberative body it was designed to be.

I think this system would work better than the one we have today, but there are certainly several drawbacks.  The biggest one would be non-monetary campaign contributions, like weekends in Dubai or something.  I also think that the creation / administration of such a centralized contribution system would be difficult and the whole concept would probably be challenged as a violation of First Amendment rights.

While I feel like Gingrich started off strong in his (as usual) tirade against the media, and garnered plenty of applause for it, Santorum's attacks on Gingrich's past as Speaker and attacks on his grandiosity were very effective. Which probably just means more votes for Romney. However his support of SOPA/PIPA might hurt him (although I can't blame him for wondering ""Who decided that the Internet had no rules?"" given his google results).

Paul was Paul, and though he made a very lucid point on the discussion of free trade with China, it'll probably be lost on most people who watched him. Like always, he lacks a good, succinct way to make his points and often came off as a rambling (if not lovable) old man.

Romney seemed on the defensive for most of the night and seemed to fall behind, in my opinion. He was squirmy rather than an executive, and his answers to the tax forms question just simply fell apart. I think he was one of the few people to get downright booed tonight.

Now before tonight I would have said it'll be a close match between Newt and Mitt with Santorum third, but now I'm not so sure. I think Santorum might have effectively evened the playing field for second place between himself and Newt. Normally I would say Romney would have been hurt by a performance like his tonight, but he's had remarkable staying power and I don't think anything big enough to knock him down came out in the debate tonight.

Thoughts?

TL;DR I think Santorum won the debate, SC Primary will be Romney first with Santorum and Newt close for 2nd and 3rd."	t5_2s6h3	True

I hope someone can show me where I'm wrong with this logic.


So, a vote is merely a way to express your opinion. If your opinion is uninformed then it's less credible and less important. If we were in a small group taking a vote on where to go to dinner, and 5 people were restaurant enthusiasts, maybe even professional reviewers and another 6 people only eats fast food because that's all they've ever known, then why shouldn't those fast food eating people's votes count less? They're less informed and their votes will lead to a worse decision.


So, going by that logic, why do we let everyone vote? Even more, why do we **encourage** everyone to vote? Campaigns like ""Get Out The Vote"" are more harmful than helpful in my opinion. I really don't care if you're a Nazi or an Anarchist in beliefs, I believe you should be allowed to vote as long as you understand the basic facts of the issues. 


Now, I also understand that the United States is a republic, not a democracy and that mitigates this issue a bit, but we still seem to choose representatives who win by relying on the population's ignorance. Too many Americans get their news from a politician's mouth. 

I also understand that tests to qualify for voting have created some very discriminatory policies in history. But I don't believe that is an ultimate logical result from having some sort of political knowledge test to qualify people to vote.
