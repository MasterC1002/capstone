1360202997.0	181erw	Hello, CrappyDesign. I have a job for you.	_depression	199	16	186	"###EDIT: You guys are fucking awesome.

Dearest friends,

I'd like to get your assistance in creating the most amazingly bad designs ever for a logo. I know, I know, I can do this myself, right? Well, my client suggested I ask for help.

My brother came up to me today with a request. ""_Depression,"" he said as he kicked off his shoes, ""you do that drawing stuff, right?""

""Um...""

""Listen, I want you to make me a logo.""

I was taken aback. Was this a homework assignment for one of his classes? No, he wants to start his own t-shirt/design brand (and yet, he can't design the logo?). ""I'll be putting the quotes on the shirts and stuff,"" he told me, and apparently ""I have a lot of friends who would already want to buy it.""

This is amazing. I asked, ""So you want me to make the logo?""

""Yeah, use your drawing or design, or even that anime shit.""

""What do you want it to say?""

###""Hustle Pride.""

Dude I can already see it now. ""Oh, and I want it done by like, next week so I can start making the shirts and making cash. So you need to get it done. You can **ask your weird friends to help if you need**.""

Fuck yeah, let me ask my weird friends!

This is where you come in, CrappyDesign. I want to make this work. It is the [**HUSTLEPRIDE LOGO DESIGN COMPETITION**](http://i.imgur.com/RIOv2PX.png).

(Yes, that is my brother.)

Here's the deal:

* There will be **5 winners**, who will all get **1 month of Reddit Gold** (I can provide pictures of myself holding $20 bills like a G if the mods require).
* All judging will be **based on upvotes**.
* SEXUALLY OR RACIALLY OFFENSIVE ENTRIES ARE NOT ALLOWED.
* Final decision will be made by me on any and all entries.
* I WILL MAKE A T-SHIRT OF THE WINNINGEST ENTRY AND MAKE MY BROTHER WEAR IT AS FOLLOW-UP FOR THE COMPETITION.


###**EDIT:**

###The due date is going to be February 12, 2013 at 10:00 PM EST."	t5_2sa3m	True

Vote totals on the submissions don't really matter because it might have been a slow day or something. I really don't care if you nominate yourself you worthless karmawhore. Upvoting in this thread won't really matter. Just nominate stuff and then we'll have a separate post with all the nominations for you to vote on. Also if you have an idea for another category- let's hear it. Also I understand that we can award reddit gold to the winners but I haven't seen a 'how' post on it yet from the admins.

So you MIGHT win reddit gold if you win this shitfest- so participate for your own selfish good. Enjoy."	t5_2sa3m	True

April 7, 2011

Polling among redditors aged 28-30 living in the Schaumburg Illinois area sucking in unemployment and living in their underwear has shown that downvotes just aren't the 'hip' thing for today's youth. In an effort to be 'Jive' and 'Relevant,' the r/crappydesign board of directors made this bold move that they said would quote ""Bring r/crappydesign into the new decade of relevance and usefulness.""

They added, quote, ""Besides, you morons that keep downvoting crap are pissing in my corn flakes.""
