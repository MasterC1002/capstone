1367771985.0	1dqk1y	An Experiment (Upvote me) [MODPOST]	A_Mirror	5606	3147	80	"Hello friends!  

**Please upvote this self post for which I receive no karma.  It's important and we need you folks to read it.**

We're going to be trying out the score hiding system on our subreddit for the next couple of weeks as a bit of an experiment.  The thing is, us mods are not going to be affected by it, so our browsing experience is not going to be affected in any significant way.  

Why are we doing this, you might ask.  Well, I've seen my fair share of people post that they're not going to answer a question due to the fact that someone else had already answered it and gotten the top spot in the comments.

I don't like that.  It's not a contest.  If you like the question you should answer it, even if someone else has already posted an answer, to hell with whether or not it'll make the top post.  I've posted more than my fair share of answers that got maybe 2 upvotes, and I knew they'd never see the light of day, but that's okay.

Hopefully this change will help cut down on this happening, because for the first 8 hours that a post has been created it will not display the upvotes/downvotes tally.

**We need your help.**

How can you help?  Well, simply continue to browse ELIAMA, post, answer questions, etc., but pay more attention to how you feel when you're doing so.  After you've got yourself a solid opinion on the score hiding, post it here in this thread.

**We need your opinions.**

So get out there and get to work and let us know what you think!

A couple reminders:

1.  Be sure to message the mods when you report a post.  It will be attended to faster, and we'll know why you reported it.

2.  Remember to read over the sidebar now and again!  If there are any big rule changes we will make a modpost, but it never hurts to stay informed.  There's even a link to a guide to our flair!

**TL;DR** - We're hiding comment scores to encourage people to post their answers.  We need your feedback.  In a couple weeks we'll make a decision on whether to keep it or not.

If you have any questions, post them here, and I'll answer them the best I can."	t5_2t5iz	True

So, after two weeks of hiding scores it would seem to the mod team that the general pattern of responses remains unchanged!

As many of your have expressed frustration with being unable to see feedback immediately I am removing the score hiding for the subreddit.  They're aren't enough positive results to balance out the negative (As expressed by you, the users) so we will be going back to The Old Way.  No godless man may sit the-...oh...sorry, the other old way.

Anyways, as always, just a couple reminders!

1.  Remember to message the mods when reporting a post, give us a link, we'll get to it much faster (And know why you're reporting it, and even give you feedback on whether or not we think it breaks the rules)

2.  Read the rules!  If you haven't done it in a while, it never hurts.

Gonna get this out of the way real quick, but we are going to make a small change to the rules.  *Meta posts are allowed, but they must be cleared by the moderators via modmail first.* There we go.

I've asked our new mods to write a brief hello to you, so here they are:

/u/Kingofalldownvotes  
*Hey! I'm KingOfAllDownvotes, your friendly neighbourhood new moderator. I'm here to keep watch of all you here young'uns, so y'all play nice.*

/u/K_Lobstah  
*Answers to KLob, Lob or Sweet Baby K.  One time he rode down a whole flight of stairs in a dresser drawer. He's had stitches four times in his life, three of which were on his face.
After such trauma and damage to the moneymaker, Sweet Baby K was forced to give up on his lifelong dream of becoming a male stripper and hit the mean streets of the internet.
He's overeducated, under-motivated, and when you get right down to it, just kind of an overall jackass. [Here's an accurate visual representation.](http://i.imgur.com/BIIuZln.jpg) May God have mercy on you all.*

/u/JoeCracko  
*It's a pleasure to be a part of the ELIAMA team. A little about myself: I've been practicing the discipline of Parkour since 2005, and earned my teaching certification through Parkour Generations. I am the lead moderator of /r/Parkour and the creator of /r/ParkourTeachers. My technical background is in computer science with a minor in web development. Cheers, all!*

First off, I'd like to say hello again.  I haven't had much time to post and award flair for the last two weeks as [I have been in the UK and taking pictures of stuff and sightseeing etc.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/1ifyqt/i_just_got_back_from_the_uk_and_here_are_a_bunch/)  I'm back though, so yay!

[](/yayflutter)

[](/sp)

Also, as a quick reminder, please remember to upvote questions that you think have potential!  At any point in time there are usually only a handful of trending questions on the front page.  **Use those orange arrows.  Let us know what you want answered, don't just upvote threads with answers!!!**

So, earlier this month I posted a thread asking for feedback from the community on how we can improve our subreddit.  Needless to say, you geniuses have given us some great ideas, and starting this coming week we are going to be making some changes in response to said feedback.

##Flair Free Threads

One of the biggest issues we've gotten complaints about is that new users often feel intimidated by some of our more regular posters, and often they won't respond to a question because it already has a well written answer from one of our power users.  We love our power users, but we also love the rest of you girls and guys and we are gonna be making some threads designed specifically for you folks who haven't gotten flair yet.

Mondays and Fridays, the mods will be posting a Flair Free thread with several questions to be answered only by those of you untainted by the touch of Flair.  We will be using old questions that were a big hit and there will usually be anywhere from 3-5 of them to pick from.

Our moderators will be keeping on eye on what you post, so don't plagiarize old comments or we will delete your post and maybe even give you flair of shame :o 

If anyone with flair posts a top level comment Benson the Bot aka ThatShitsNotWelcome will belete it so fast it'll make your head spin, so don't even think about it, baby.

##Questioner Flair

Where would we be without such awe inspiring questions as ""Explain how to make a pot of coffee like you're Dr. Cox"" or ""Explain the unwritten rules of the playground as if you were a hard-boiled detective in a noir crime novel""?  We're going to be rewarding people who ask questions that turn out good answers.

We're still working on the fine details of it, but rest assured, it will happen soonish!

Lastly, I'd like to give a shoutout to /r/AMAlikeIAMA  

It's a concept that one of our users thought of and we encouraged him to start his own subreddit.  There's not a lot of content on it right now, **but that will change if you subscribe and start posting over there!**

##TL;DR

Read it.

Thanks again for being wonderful authors, questioners, dudes, and dudettes.  I'd like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for making my job so easy and consistently churning out amazing posts.  Sometimes I laugh, sometimes I cry, sometimes I feel like I'm going to be sick, and that's exactly what I love about this place.

Oh, and as always, if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, feel free to respond in the comments below!

Well, not you specifically, just /u/mattblau and /u/jimmysilverrims, winners of our 50k art contest!

How can there be more than one?  Well, technically Jimmy's submission garnered the most upvotes, but he much preferred Matt's submission (As did a number of our moderators) and told us that he would rather see the pirate up at the top of our subreddit.

This makes them both winners, in a weird way that makes me feel slightly unsettled!  As such, I've given them both a special gold flair that we reserve only for those of you who go above and beyond the call of duty, and possibly maybe bribe us but don't tell your friends.

So congratulate your new art overlords, fools, congratulate them and pray they do not draw penises in sharpie on your foreheads.

Good work, ladies and gents, and remember to read the rules before you post!

1369682591.0	1f5id0	[Mod Post] Caulfield45's departing wishlist for ELIAMA	caulfield45	357	61	26	"As I say bye to the moderating crew in the hopes that it'll help me stop procrastinating through grad school (I wish, right?) I'm leaving this list of things that can help make this board really, really get things forward.
 
1. If you're flaired and a heavy contributor, do the newbies a favor and don't post for a few hours after a thread comes in that's in your wheelhouse. You'll likely still get your huge upvote count and hundreds of comments, but it gives those not as established a chance to give us something great like you've been doing. Or better yet, shift gears and create new, exciting questions for the community to answer, and maybe give a supporting comment when someone comes in with a great reply.
 
2. Here's an example of a really bad title: ""Explain [low artistic work] like I'm [high artistic work]"". That get posted a LOT and rarely gets comments.
 
3. Here's another example of a bad title: ""Explain [recent development] like I'm [person who has ignored news for a day/lived under a rock, etc.]"" 
 
4. We just passed 60,000 subscribers, but we have a lot of room to grow. Tell your friends! And if you hate it here, tell your enemies!
 
5. Reporting a thread. Reporting doesn't do much good, as it turns out, because it doesn't tell the mods *what* exactly you're trying to report. Messaging the moderators is *muuuch* more effective. Click ""message the moderators"" right next to the list of mods in the sidebar. We don't often respond, but we have a pretty efficient crew here that gets the job done.
 
Ok, that's long enough. In just a few months, this sub went from dust and wind to an insane driver of excellent content on Reddit. It's been really, really fun watching it grow and I can only hope I'll be able to contribute as well as many of you have from a new angle.
 
Sincerely,
 
That one mod you never saw.

1370999644.0	1g5xw9	[MODPOST] Now Hiring!	A_Mirror	249	16	71	"###UPVOTE THIS POST.  WE WANT AS MANY PEOPLE TO SEE IT AS POSSIBLE.  TELL YOUR FRIENDS!

Hello underli-...friends!

First of all I would like to thank you wonderful users for continuing to impress me with your awesome questions and wonderful answers.  Please continue to be cool dudes and dudettes.

I'll cut right to the chase, we need a couple of new moderators.  I do my best to stay active on the subreddit, remove circlejerk-y questions, delete off topic answers, and just generally interact with the community.  /u/benzrf is a wonderful CSS wiz and helps keep the new queue under wraps. LBTG and 1988 help when they can, but it seems like it's not quite enough to me sometimes.  

We've talked about it, and we're going to be needing a couple new moderators to muck out the stables, so if you're interested in being a moderator here is what we're looking for:

*  **CSS experience.**

The more people on the team that can do fun stuff with our CSS, the better.  If you're very experienced with CSS, it greatly increases our chances of picking you!

*  **Familiarity with ELIAMA**

Having a posting history with a mix of questions and answers and banter is not necessary, but it will also help.  It's the reason I was added as a mod, and from the sounds of it that probably wasn't a mistake.  

*  **Moderating experience**

Are you a moderator on other subreddits?  Know the moderating suite of tools?  You probably know them better than I do!  It's no silver bullet, but it looks great.

**How do I apply?**  
Leave a response in the comments with your experience and why you want to be a moderator.  We'll be reviewing the thread as time goes along.  There's no real deadline for when the new mods will be announced, it'll happen when it happens!

##""A_Mirror, I'm not interested in being a mod, or I don't think I'm going to be able to make the cut.  Is there anything I can do?""

YES!!!

We always want community feedback.  Opinions, suggestions, angry rants, it's all welcome (So long as you remember Rule 1).  I don't care if you've been here a week or if you've been here longer than I have, we want your brain meats.  Leave a comment saying thanks, or suggesting we do something different, or criticism of our policies, or questions.  I'll do my best to read through everything that gets sent to me and answer as many questions as I can.

As always, please, when you report a comment send a message to the moderators with a reason why you are reporting it.  It's not always readily apparent why you are reporting a post; the clarification is helpful.  We can get to it faster when it's modmail'd because we get an immediate notification as opposed to having to check the modqueue to see if there are any reported posts and we can let you know if the post itself isn't breaking any rules or clear up any confusion.

##tl;dr - We need mods.  Interested?  Read above.  We need opinions too, so post them.

Please upvote this self post for which I receive no karma.  We want everyone to read it!

Rules are simple, submit an imgur link with your entry as a top-level post. If you want to give any clarification, feel free, but you must include a link to your entry!

The image must be approximately big enough to fit in the top left hand corner.  It doesn't need to be an exact size, but anything larger than 200x200 is probably too big.

Don't know what I'm talking about?  Click the big red banner at the top that says GOD DAMN BUT 50K IS A BIG NUMBER and read up!

**To celebrate the occasion, we will be holding a contest to determine which among you has the greatest aptitude for the arts, upon which point we will enslave that person to create a new, better logo to adorn our BEAUTIFUL UPPER-LEFT-HAND-CORNER. This person will receive NO PAYMENT WHATSOEVER apart from a measly golden flair and maybe reddit gold, in accordance with our 'ethics' committee's decision. This contest will take place shortly. This is that modpost.**

Limit one entry per person, make it your best effort!  You're trying to design us an icon we can put in the upper left hand corner.

After two weeks (April 4th)  we will be announcing the winner who may or may not get a month of reddit gold and some sort of special flair type thing!

Exclamation marks!

Have at it, and please remember to upvote this self post, which I receive no karma, for to increase visibility.

Greetings peasants! It is I, creator of the mighty bot that ensures your compliance with our totalitarian policies. I have descended from my throne in MOD-HEAVEN to take part in the ensuing festivities marking the 50,000th poor sucker to subscribe to our glorious subreddit.

To celebrate the occasion, we will be holding a contest to determine which among you has the greatest aptitude for the arts, upon which point we will enslave that person to create a new, better logo to adorn our BEAUTIFUL UPPER-LEFT-HAND-CORNER. This person will receive NO PAYMENT WHATSOEVER apart from a measly golden flair ^^^^and ^^^^maybe ^^^^reddit ^^^^gold, in accordance with our 'ethics' committee's decision. This contest will take place shortly. Watch out for another modpost.

We will also be launching a brand new flair designed to honor those who are more prolific and talented than the average member of you unwashed masses. You may observe it next to my name; it is a fairly nice shade of blue, and has bold Helvetica lettering. None of this is stolen from /r/circlebroke. They took it from us by time travel. NONE APPROACH THE GLORY AND INGENUITY OF THE MODS OF OUR WONDERFUL SUBREDDIT.

Finally, an overview of all the currently used flair:

* [Regular flair](#userflairl)[|](#padding) is given out sporadically for answers we especially like. It's fairly common.
* [Flair of shame](#userflairl userflair-shamel)[|](#padding) is very occasionally given out to people who suck. Not often seen these days. NOT to be considered a mark of honor, OR ELSE.
* [Golden flair](#userflairl userflair-goldl)[|](#padding) was given out to five people who won in the bestof2012 event a while back, and will be given to the creator of our new logo.
* [Flair of quality](#userflairl userflair-qualityl)[|](#padding) will be awarded to people who regularly post flairworthy responses. Said flair may be taken away if a user becomes inactive.
* Finally, [gilded flair](#userflairl userflair-gildedl)[|||](#padding) denotes a person who has received reddit gold for one or more of their responses, and who the mods consider to have deserved said gold. It does not fade. It can also be mixed with [other](#userflairl userflair-gildedl userflair-shamel)[|||](#padding) [flair](#userflairl userflair-gildedl userflair-goldl)[|||](#padding) [types](#userflairl userflair-gildedl userflair-qualityl)[|||](#padding).

1358145094.0	16jet4	[MOD POST] Pretty Unimportant Stuff Starring: Welcome Tentacle Porn Enthusiasts, A Victory Over Our Rival Subreddit, and the Best Of '12 Results (Spoiler Alert: You probably didn't win)	jonnybegood	51	12	15	"Hello and welcome to the roughly 3k people who found this subreddit through the tentacle porn submission (phrasing?). Enjoy your stay here, read the sidebar pretty please, feel free to reach out and give the mods a ~~handy~~ hello.

And, with your numbers swelling our ""stature"", I am proud to announce that the war is over. And I am proud to announce that I declared war a little over 2 months ago, telling virtually no one about it until now, now that we have won.

A brilliant subreddit, /r/comeonandslam, full of remixes of that Space Jam song, whose name escapes me. A subreddit ~~shitty~~ worthy enough to be our rival subreddit. Faced with every other option, we declared war and today, my compadres, we have surpassed them. The battle was fought and we took them like a Kraken to a shy, overly developed Japanese girl.

**The Best Of Finale**

For Best Of '12, we do have the results &amp; winners chosen. Once I am less drunk and lazy, I'll give out the gold and the flair to:

 /u/boojamon for Consistently Awesome Contributorhood (also technically should have won two categories, but fuck that)

/u/scribbling_des [for Underappreciated But Actually Amazing Explanation](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeIAmA/comments/14euhn/explain_color_like_im_blind/c7ci8ac)

/u/mirior for [Best In Character Explanation](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeIAmA/comments/14ooii/explain_bioshock_like_iama_cave_johnson/c7f1pcb)

/u/fascist_unicorn for [Unlikely Combo Request that Actually Works Out Pretty Nicely](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeIAmA/comments/14xbdf/explain_sailor_moon_like_iam_ron_swanson/)

/u/rocknrollercoaster for [Best Request Idea
](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeIAmA/comments/15p5gw/explain_in_detail_how_you_personally_evade_taxes/)

Thanks everyone for participating.  People who nominated will get some flair for their nominations unless I forget that I promised this. Now that I've built up some nice text-camouflage, we're going to add some more mods from those who are active in this subreddit and read through mod posts, also while you're here, I was going to make a Squidward/Zoidberg tentacle joke, but I'm afraid that's a real thing, is it? now back to your regularly scheduled mod post. We might do other things to recognize the runner ups, but they'll be getting condolence flair. 

TL;DR OH REDDITOR-SAN, I DO LIKE CALAMARI, WHY DO YOU ASK?

UPDATE: Gold has been given out, despite hangover and continued laziness. Yes, I am a hero.

UPDATE 2: tHank you.
