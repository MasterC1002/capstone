A girl named Jenn, who is in the process of rowing around Lake Michigan to raise money for Breast Cancer, was sexually assaulted last night in Michigan and everyone is desperate to find her attacker.	pleasehelpjenn	148	23	21	"I am not affiliated with Jenn, or her organization Row 4 ROW, but I know her and saw this on Facebook and I know the power of Reddit so I was hoping this would help. Jenn is an extraordinary woman who is pushing herself to the limit by rowing around the perimeter of Lake Michigan to raise money for Breast Cancer. Just today she was sexually assaulted by someone who is believed to have traveled a significant distance to cause her this harm. This is the statement that was released by her organization, Row4ROW:

Unfortunately, the Row4ROW team has some sad news to report and we need your help. Jenn was set to row to Beaver Island on Sunday morning but was attacked and sexually assaulted by a man in the early morning hours. Investigators have reason to believe the assailant traveled a significant distance to commit the assault.... The suspect is described as a white male in his 30s, approximately 5’8” to 6’ tall, with a fair amount of facial stubble hair, but not a full beard nor mustache. The man has light eyes, an average to athletic build and shorter well-kept hair. He was wearing a grayish green t-shirt, jean shorts and tennis shoes. A bright yellow Jeep Wrangler was seen in the area. It has a spare tire on the back with a yellow smiley face on it. Investigators are seeking information about this vehicle. Anyone with information or investigative leads please call the Michigan State Police toll-free at 1-866-411-0018. Please know that Jenn is safe and in good hands. A statement from her about the trip and future plans will be made very soon. Please re-post and help us find this criminal. Thank you for your continued support of Row4ROW.

It sickening to think that this could happen to anyone, let alone to someone that has set their life aside to help raise money and awareness for Breast Cancer. Please call Michigan State Police toll-free at 1-866-411-0018 if you know anything that could help with this investigation.

I understand that it's a heartbreaking video, and you want to raise awareness, but a state-centric subreddit isn't the place to do it.  If you have info about a video-showing in Michigan, or a fundraiser, or anything like that here in Michigan I promise to upvote it; but if you think you should just post something about a global crisis to another subreddit you're doing it wrong.  Post it to Facebook or Google+ (ha, kidding about Google+, no one uses that) to spread your info to the non-redditing friends who may not have seen it."	t5_2qhtl	True

ever since I spent a long summer weekend on the quiet campus of ann arbor a few years ago after driving from california, posted up in boardshorts the whole weekend, floating down the huron in 90 degree weather, drinking beer on the porch watching the sun set damn near 10, I have held a special place in my heart for summer in Michigan.  now I love summer in the woods as much as the next guy, but after seeing photos of sleeping bear dunes, I have been on intent on finding the third coast highway (think pacific coast highway 1) and I am setting out to find it in three weeks time with my brother.  i'm planning on catching beaches on huron, Michigan, superior, and even good ol' erie for good measure.  

my back-of-the-napkin itinerary is Cleveland -&gt; Detroit -&gt; the 25 to bay city -&gt; the 23 to Cheboygan -&gt; the 75 into yooper territory -&gt; get lost in the UP for awhile (pictured rocks, pop the falls in Tahquamenon? shh don't tell anyone, Houghton, what else?) -&gt; the 31 south to the dunes -&gt; then cross the peninsula to ann arbor to meet my sister who will be a wolverine '18 this fall!

so since the furthest I've been on this trip is the start (Detroit) and the end (ann arbor), i'm looking for your advice on how to find the third coast highway.  I'd like to camp absolutely as much as possible, under the stars, on the beach, in the woods wherever.  I'd like to get out to some islands if possible (pch1 doesn't have that!).  i'd like to eat the local food.  i'd like to surf on one wave.  i'd also like to get weird in the UP.

guys, help me find the third coast!  

-Justin

**edit: guys, this is amazing.  thanks Michiganders, I am on google maps plotting all of your amazing suggestions.  i'll make an update when i'm done- a crowd-sourced third coast highway roadmap by r/Michigan !**"	t5_2qhtl	True

I'm really proud of it, and I think its worth the $30 price point.

Obviously I'm here asking that you go out and pick it up.  It will be available in stores, and I would rather you do it that way, as it would help out even more Michigan peeps if you didn't buy it off amazon.  That said, I can't say for sure how many copies each store will have.  I imagine they aren't ordering tons of copies, as it is being released by a smaller publisher (Crave) with little advertising going into it.

So, please give it a thought and check out the game here http://www.cravegames.com/Man_Vs_Wild/

URGENT!	RRSignalMaintainer	70	9	8	"Facebook Group: [Save the Spirit of Traverse City Steam Train](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Save-The-Spirit-of-Traverse-City-Steam-Train/218075531556342)

In Traverse City, MI, there is a 1/4 scale steam train that has been around for ages, kept in excellent running condition by a group of very dedicated people.  The train sits in a park on the waterfront that used to house a zoo (which the city removed, leaving a ton of open green space).  

Now the planning commission has got it in their head that they should go against what nearly everyone in TC is saying, and rip out this community gem in order to put in a bathroom and a splash pad like every other generic town in this state has.  There is a TON of room in this park to put in both and very easily save the train, but there is a lot of political BS going on behind the scenes, and a few of the commissioners, and a private developer have it out for the train.

It is a unique gem, and every time I drive past it, there are a bunch of people riding the train at $3 a pop (It brings in over $50,000 into the city each summer).   Families have been riding this train for generations.  

The city secretly pushed through the decision to remove it without public comment, and they are threatening anyone that tries to spread word of it being removed.  The commissioners are also ignoring e-mails on the subject.

Can we help save something that is truly 'Pure Michigan'?   The trains last run is labor day.

Thanks a ton Reddit!


EDIT: Here is a video of the train running, with an average load of riders.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OX6fd2WKJU&amp;feature=related

And a video shot from the locomotive of the entire ride.

One of his bills cuts education funding by $1,500 per student. Teachers seem overwhelmingly in support of striking despite it being illegal for them to do. 

An ""Emergency Financial Advisor"", herein referred to as ""Czar"", was appointed for Benton Harbor. I believe the Czar has already fired the Mayor (if not has threatened to do so) and has effectively dissolved the city council (perhaps sterilized or nullified are better words as council no longer allowed to make decisions).

We can demonstrate from 6:30 to 7:30 p.m. at both the front and back doors of the Isabella County Building. Bring a sign, a bull horn, musical instruments, whatever you like, but most importantly BRING YOUR FRIENDS.

I implore you, it's quick and easy to make a difference in the interest for our personal freedom. Give a call to their numbers, and 99% of the time, I find you'll leave a message with a secretary or intern.

For those voting **YES**, thank them for fighting for your personal and private freedoms, and if you feel inclined, say whatever else (you've helped my vote, I'll spread the word, etc).

For those voting **NO**, express disappointment for choosing to limit your privacy and personal freedoms, express lack of interest in voting, etc.

Whatever you say, MAKE IT COUNT. We need them to understand that their choices are public and that it makes a difference to us, *especially* when something this important is separated by 12 votes.

Good luck, and thanks for making a difference, Michiganders."	t5_2qhtl	True

Thank you for contacting me with your concerns regarding the protection of your Fourth Amendment rights. I appreciate hearing from you on this important issue.

As chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, it is my responsibility to ensure strict and thorough congressional oversight of the important work done by America’s intelligence agencies. I have been disheartened by dangerous national security leaks that have grossly distorted two vital National Security Agency programs that have proved very effective in preventing terror attacks in the U.S. without infringing on Americans’ privacy and civil liberties.
At a time when the Obama administration’s IRS, Benghazi and Justice Department scandals have understandably damaged Americans’ trust in their government, it is important to understand why these programs are different. Neither program allows the NSA to read e-mails or listen to phone calls of American citizens. Both programs are constitutional and do not violate any American’s Fourth Amendment rights. Both are strictly overseen by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a federal court created in 1978 to protect the rights of American citizens in the course of foreign intelligence gathering.

There are also several layers of checks and balances put in place around these programs within the executive branch and Congress. Both programs are overseen by lawyers and compliance auditors from the Department of Justice, the director of national intelligence and multiple independent inspectors general. Both have also been authorized by large bipartisan majorities in Congress and are regularly reviewed by the House and Senate intelligence committees. The effectiveness of these programs is without question. Both have produced vital intelligence that has prevented dozens of terrorist attacks within the U.S. and around the world.

The first program allows the NSA to preserve a limited category of business records to help identify foreign terrorists and their plots to attack the U.S. This court-authorized program allows NSA to preserve only phone records such as the numbers dialed and the date, time and duration of calls. These records do not include the names or personal information of any American and do not include any content of calls.

When the NSA wants to query the records, it must establish through a court-approved process that there is a reasonable suspicion a specific number is connected to a foreign terrorist. Only a limited number of analysts can obtain approval to conduct a narrow and targeted search of those numbers. If U.S. connections are found, they are passed to the FBI for further investigation. If the FBI wants to determine the identity of a phone number resulting from an NSA search, they must obtain a separate court order. These call record searches, which are regularly audited for compliance by all three branches of government, are a vital tool for connecting the dots between foreign terrorists plotting attacks in the U.S. and in other countries.

The second program, known as PRISM, allows the NSA to obtain a court order to access the electronic communications of suspected foreign terrorists overseas. Because much of the world’s Internet traffic flows through U.S. infrastructure, the law allows the NSA to obtain the specific communications of foreign suspects from U.S. companies with a court order. This program does not create a “back door” to any U.S. company’s server. This program cannot and does not monitor the communications of any U.S. citizens.
All 535 members of Congress have had access to classified briefings describing the specific uses of these two programs, though not all members have chosen to attend these briefings.

It is important to consider the source of the news media leaks about these two vital intelligence programs. These leaks came from a person not involved in the careful execution of these programs, and with access to only small pieces of a larger puzzle. He decided to break the law and the oath he took to the American people by publicly disclosing parts of these classified programs, and then fled to China. These are the actions of a felon, not a whistle-blower.
The effectiveness of these programs depends on them being kept secret from the foreign terrorists they target. It is much easier for terrorists to hide from us if they understand the sources and methods of our intelligence gathering. We have already seen al-Qaida begin to shift their communication tactics as a result of these leaks, and it will now be much harder for us to find them.

It is no coincidence that the leaders from across the American political spectrum who take the time to understand these important programs are also their strongest supporters. They understand that these narrowly targeted programs are legal, do not invade Americans’ privacy rights, and are essential to detecting and disrupting future terrorist attacks.

Rest assured I take the privacy rights of Americans very seriously. As Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence I will continue vigilant oversight of these programs to ensure they are not abused and would never allow such techniques to be used against American citizens, without due process.

Again, thank you for contacting me. Please keep in touch with any additional questions or concerns.

Sincerely,

Mike Rogers  
Member of Congress

Please don't post links like that.  

A) The new redditor was almost certainly a troll, and if they weren't trolling they were crazy

B) Grabbing pitchforks and downvoting isn't going to make people think better of us, it makes us look petty

C) If you can't handle someone criticizing your city or state on the internet you shouldn't be on the internet

D) The comment wasn't even that negative

Hopefully few of you even know what I'm talking about, it should be a minor thing that I removed before it got any bigger.  Just understand that Reddit or any subreddit isn't your personal army(or shouldn't be); any slight towards Michigan shouldn't be a call to arms.  If we all had to defend every single negative statement against Detroit our job would never be finished.  Reply to them and then realize that it's a comment on the internet and will be forgotten in an hour.

Fuck that, I want to DO SOMETHING about this!

If there's nothing yet, let's get the ball rolling, r/Michigan!

I found some information on recalling state officials from the [National Conference of State Legislatures](http://www.ncsl.org/default.aspx?tabid=16581).
&gt;The language in Michigan's Constitution, however, is more typical and acknowledges the political nature of recall efforts: ""The sufficiency of any statement of reasons or grounds ... shall be a political rather than a judicial question."" (Const. Art. II §8)

According to the NCSL, we would need signatures equaling ""25% of total votes cast for position at last election"" within 90 days. According to the [New York Times](http://elections.nytimes.com/2010/results/michigan), the total votes cast for the race for Governor in 2010 was 3,226,061 votes. A quarter of that would be 806,516 signatures.

So, what do we do? What's the first step?"	t5_2qhtl	True

I read the article on here, about the dude living in his van and working, and was wondering if there is anyone in Michigan that would know..

* Legal places to sleep at night. ( I don't want it like how that guy got it, guns in the face by cops, hassled.)

* Most cost effective way to shower and hygiene. The Fitness club is a good idea, but I might be driving around all over the state doing odd-jobs to survive, so having a gym 50+ miles away probably won't work very well...

* Laws about living inside of your vehicle? Does anyone know how I can keep myself out of trouble on that one?


Thanks. Chances are I'll get a big fuck-you from the community, but if anyone knows of any good idea's lemme know, I only have internet tonight and tomorrow (I'll be checking answer's tomorrow, have to go back and clean out my house), after that I have to go to the library, and I don't reddit there, I focus on resumes and applications.

Right now it's still in the planing stages as what to do, where to do it, and when.     

Another thing is obviously we all know times are tough for most people so finding the place that accomidates most of us would be best, Also if enough redditors are in an area we might be able to work out some sort of carpooling (Due to the fact that we have no transportation system and gas isn't cheap).      

If you're interested just post some ideas you have.

To edit the map and add your pin, hit the big red edit button (You need a Google account) and then look for the blue pin button in the corner to add your pin.  Or just post your town name here and I'll be sure to add it to the map.  

**ALSO: Be sure to add your location even if it's already added to the map (Unless you posted for us to add you to the map) that way we know how many Redditors live in that area.**

1347491458.0	zsiyf	Beer Drinkers of Michigan! Please help my friend bring her craft beer retail store proposal to Detroit!	klyther	48	11	33	"Hi everyone,

Detroit's first craft beer retail tasting room, The Collective Tap, is needing the beer community's votes to win a $50k grant from Comerica to open its doors. The Collective Tap will focus mainly on Midwestern, Belgian and English beers and be the first store devoted to craft beer in the city. We’ll also have a tasting bar with rotating beers on tap so customers can always sample a new brew or two (or a few) before purchase and feature a range of beer tasting classes. The classes will range from topics like how to homebrew, pairing beer with food, and themed nights, like Belgian Trappist flight nights!

Currently there are no places in the city where you can swing by to pick up a bottle of craft beer from a wide selection of high-quality breweries. This means that people who like a variety of beer have to drive to the suburbs for options. Having a store like this in Detroit helps to keep money in the city while also educating people about the wonderfully diverse world of beer.

Plus, the Collective Tap has a community focus as well. A monthly in-store program will highlight a local non-profit to raise awareness for the work being done in the community by the organization. For example, a certain percentage will be donated to the non-profit for every six-pack sold on Fridays.

The store has a chance to win a $50k cash prize and another $50k in support services (legal, marketing, accounting) to help open up the store. However, the way the competition works is that the top ten are open to a public vote. The top four business ideas that accumulate the most votes move on to the next stage where they face questions from business people in Detroit.

If you are interested in supporting this idea, you can vote for The Collective Tap on the Hatch Detroit FB page (www.facebook.com/HatchDetroit) or on their website (hatchdetroit.com/vote) once a day, every day, from now until 6 pm EST on September 18th.

For more info about The Collective Tap, you can go to our website at www.thecollectivetap.com or follow us on Facebook at www.facebook.com/TheCollectiveTap

Thanks so much!

EDIT 2: Seems to be a popular plan, so meetup is split to Southwest and Southeast Michigan meetups. Possible places for Southeast: Woodward Ave Brewery (Ferndale). Southwest: Founders (Grand Rapids)

1301507520.0	geuip	Ithaca High School plans to build an $850,000 football stadium.  My letter to my editor.	mbunting577	45	5	21	"Dear Ithaca Citizens,

I write this out of deep concern about some recent ideas brought forth to make some changes in our community. If you do not wish to be offended, stop reading. I am an Ithaca High School 2010 graduate. The current mindset of the citizens that led to the proposed changes is truly sickening. The proposed stadium in Ithaca is absolutely ludicrous considering the current condition of the economy. Governor Rick Snyder has proposed a plan which will cut schools by $470 per pupil. With Ithaca’s district having about 1,354, the proposed cut next year comes out to $636,380. Keeping that in mind, the proposed budget for this stadium is an estimated $850,000. This new stadium will not make our students smarter or athletes better. It will only be a material thing; you can’t take it with you when you leave Ithaca. Due to the current economic situation, whether you like it or not, education is going to suffer. Education is the only thing that will remain a person’s possession forever. All this stadium will do for the Ithaca Community is show every visitor that sees it where our true values lie; self-image and athletics. I think that going through with this would not only be selfish, but ignorant. I am inclined to think that many of you will donate money for this project, but have given no thought at all to donate money to the people of Japan. But then again, maybe the image of Ithaca, MI, a town of around 3,000 citizens, is more important than helping others rebuild their lives after a devastating natural disaster; and it must be more important than investing in the education of your children and neighbor’s children. At the rate we’re going, in a few years, school districts will be forced to consolidate to save money, and maybe then you’ll think twice about how your $850,000 investment could’ve been spent.

During a time that Michigan continues to lose its citizens due to the economy and a lack of jobs, our congress is spending their time and energy developing legislation to force even more people from the state and to declare to all that Michigan doesn't want you, value you or consider you equal if you're lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgendered.  

I am asking you to email your senate &amp; congress.  I am including the bill information and the contact information for the Michigan Senators and House.  Please help.  I am paralyzed with fear over what is becoming of the state in which I have always been so proud to live. 

**Bills:**

You may read the entirety of these bills by going to [The Michigan Legislature website](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/) and entering the bill number.  I am unable to link directly to them due to formatting.

**Senate Bill 0137:**  ""Matt's Safe School Law""  This has been posted in several places on reddit and was recently passed by Michigan congress.  The republicans added an amendment that states, *""THIS SECTION DOES NOT PROHIBIT A STATEMENT OF A SINCERELY HELD RELIGIOUS BELIEF  OR MORAL CONVICTION OF A SCHOOL EMPLOYEE, SCHOOL VOLUNTEER, PUPIL,  OR A PUPIL'S PARENT OR GUARDIAN. ""*  Therefore, if you truly morally or religiously BELIEVE what you are saying, this anti-bullying law doesn't apply.

**House Bill 5040:** “The Julea Ward freedom of conscious act”  This bill, if passed would prohibit a higher education program for disciplining a student who refuses to treat a patient based upon their religious beliefs.  *“A public or private degree or certificate granting college, university, junior college, or community college of this state shall not discipline or discriminate against a student in a  counseling, social work, or psychology program because the student   refuses to counsel or serve a client as to goals that conflict with  a sincerely held religious belief or moral conviction of the  student, if the student refers the client to a counselor who will  provide the counseling or services.”*

**House Bill 4770:** “A bill to prohibit public employers from providing certain benefits to public employees”  This bill would prohibit government agencies, or those who receive government funding, from providing healthcare benefits to the same-sex domestic partners of their employees.  Included would be universities who receive government money such as the University of Michigan, Michigan State University and Wayne State University.

**House bill 5039:** “A bill to amend 1976 PA 453, entitled ‘Elliott-Larsen civil rights act’ This bill would void any anti-discrimination policies developed by government-funded entities that are not part of the original Elliott-Larson civil rights act.  So, the following are still protected: religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex, height, weight, familial status, or marital status.  What’s really the only thing missing here?  Sexual orientation and gender identity.  So, if you have those on your anti-discrimination policy, legally it wouldn’t matter.  *”A STATE AGENCY OR UNIT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHALL  NOT ADOPT ANY ORDINANCE, RULE, REGULATION, OR POLICY THAT INCLUDES,  AS A PROTECTED CLASS, ANY CLASSIFICATION NOT SPECIFICALLY INCLUDED AS A PROTECTED CLASS UNDER THIS ACT. ANY EXISTING ORDINANCE, RULE, REGULATION, OR POLICY THAT INCLUDES, AS A PROTECTED CLASS, ANY  CLASSIFICATION NOT SPECIFICALLY INCLUDED AS A PROTECTED CLASS UNDER  THIS ACT IS VOID. “*
