1356429893.0	15ezwq	One of your biggest fans has gone today	aripian	2310	689	244	"I am not here for karma or any fame but I need to share something with all of you. I am an Arsenal fan from the bottom of my heart however my little brother is a Manchester United fan since he was a little lad. 2012 is the year that we see that Robin Van Persie transferred to Manchester United even though I hate it so much but it was the best thing happen to my little bro. Even it was not official back then my little bro had already made a RVP Man Utd Jersey for himself and shown it to me time by time only to make me angry. But today is not about RVP, but its about how fondly he loves this club, even though he laughed at me that Man Utd beaten Arsenal time by time, I know, it was the bond between us that made each match the match of our lives. Recently if RVP scores he will always say to me that who needs batman when you have robin? It angered me so much that I want Man Utd lose so much just for shutting him up. But all is over, my little bro was involved in an motorcycle accident and died yesterday. How my heart felt with void after I realized that I lost my little bro, the Man Utd fan, my FIFA 13 rival, my futsal team mate and mostly my best friend. After the funeral today I went to see all the past text massage that he gave to me and it brings a tear to my eye that his last massage is ""Who needs Batman when you have Robin?"". My days of watching football with my best friend is over, and I don't care if you downvote me, but I have to tell you the story of one of the biggest Man Utd fan that is near to me. I am sorry to give a sad feeling here but this is my brother, one of the biggest fan of Man Utd - sincerely from a Gooner  
 
edit: OP here, I'm sorry for not replying any of the comments because I was crying my eyes out the whole day yesterday and I have come and try to accept all of this. I thank you all for all the support and the condolences, thank you guys no matter what religion you are, what team you support and where you are, thank you so much.

update: Thank you guys for all your support, r/reddevils and r/gunners has been both well, today I will watch Man Utd vs Newcastle today and cheer for support in the place of my brother, thank you guys so much!!!

update: Thank You again to r/reddevils for the pic, it brings tear to my eyes and each time I read who need batman when you have robin I always hear my brother laugh at me, how i miss that, thank you for all your support, it is really great, I lost one Man Utd supporter but gained thousands, thank you r/reddevils and r/gunners who went to 'enemy turf' with me, and may the next arsenal vs man utd clash will be the best clash ever, thank you.

A couple of weeks ago, my younger (17) cousin was killed in a tragic road accident. Her 12-year-old brother was distraught and numb with grief. Nothing we could say or do could get him out of his shell. Even his light-hearted jibes to me about RVP being at a ""proper"" club lacked heart. 

Two days ago, on the very day of the big announcement about Fergie's departure, my uncle answered a phone-call from a gruff  Glaswegian voice, asking to speak to his son.

It was the man himself, who, to my United-mad cousin, is akin to a deity. Right up there alongside such mythical figures as Santa and [Rob Lewis](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1268332/Roy-Carroll-Pedro-Mendes-linesman--forget-Spurs-phantom-goal.html). He asked my speechless-relative how he coping, how he thought the season had went, who he thought should succeed as United manager and gave him tickets to the final home match of the season, against Swansea.

Ever since his call, my cousin has been star-struck and -more importantly- now seems to be in a much better place and is recovering from the mental trauma of his sister's death. He has come out of his shell and seems more like the care-free, footie-mad boy he was before.

So thanks to United, Sir Alex, and the staff from the very depths of my heart for making a young boy happy again. And to the fans - take pride in following such a classy club."	t5_2rxse	True

1368986470.0	1en3mr	A MASSIVE thank you to everyone who has contributed to /r/reddevils over the past 9 months.	D1794	249	24	87	"When I first became a moderator of /r/reddevils, way near the beginning of the season, there was limited activity in the sub, and most people had to stray to /r/soccer to speak about our great club. 

I put forward the suggestion of frequent match threads, created a template for pre match, match, and post match threads, and invited the community to join and get involved with them, so we could have our own opinions, our own game discussions without sharing them with people from opposing clubs, and likely to get downvoted.

The response was unbelievable. Threads now generate hundreds and hundreds of comments, all full of joy and celebrations, and occasionally some anger and sorrow. I've seen comments saying that these threads are the reason they rate our subreddit so highly, and that people join simply because they love our threads so much. If a thread doesn't get put up, I get messages saying 'Where is it!?' and despite it being a tad annoying, I'm rather proud that we were able to create a system where /r/reddevils is their go-to place on match days. In terms of active viewers on the subreddit, we have hit up to 800 on match days. That is staggering, as on average at the beginning of the season, we got about 50. (It's currently 736 as a write this!) 

***

As the season went on, more and more types of threads became frequent to our subreddit, and they were maintained very well. 

- Press conference threads EVERY WEEK, provided by /u/volandil, I'm sure they'll look a bit strange when the quotes are coming out of a different manager's mouth. Big thanks to you.

- Also, as the season went on there was a lot of calls for a most tactical analysis of United's performances. /u/rdzzl, /u/LedgeySC and Directionalvector (The latter sadly no longer a redditor) provided excellent Post Match Tactical Analysis threads which were well done, and well received by all. Thanks guys.

- Adding to the list of frequent threads was the addition of 'Loan Watch' threads, detailed posts about our our loanees and how they are faring at their temporary club. /u/fallark and /u/InfiniteLiveZ did these excellently. Thank you fellas! 

- 'Round up' threads were created for Utd fans to keep an eye on what happened in the entirety of the Premier League, and how rivals results affected us. /u/RB1011 and /u/hubwub did this very well. Cheers!

- U21 and U18 match threads. A full match thread done for our youth teams. /u/volandil and /u/fallark combined to do the amazingly, and they aren't half hearted. I'm confident that these threads gathered a lot more interested to our teams below the first-team. Big thanks.

- And the most recent one, the 'Transfer round up' threads, done by /u/zSolaris, which we hope prove effective over the summer, ensuring the sub stays bullshit free.


I mentioned that I would like the community to get involved in the creation of pre/match/post threads, so a number of you did, providing your own spin on match threads to make the enjoyable and informative for everyone. So I would like you all to join me in thanking:

/u/hubwub, /u/yiyiyiyi, /u/fallark, /u/awesometoast, /u/RB1011, /u/aloneinlove, /u/70x7, /u/aralex, /u/stoningrolls, /u/beathau5, /u/Sir_Bryan, /u/AJMcCoy612, /u/RigoIAm and /u/NGU-Ben.

If I've missed you out and you have done one of these threads, give me a message and I'll add you to it. I hope more names are added to this list next season. 

**EDIT:** I am aware that there are a huge amount of contributors to /r/reddevils that we are extremely grateful for, however, if I were to list you all, i'd be here until next season. I only listed the people who helped with the threads that appeared frequently, which created the stability in the sub and made the quality sky rocket. I don't mean to leave anyone out.

I'm glad I've shared the season with you guys, and I can't wait until the new one starts.

*** 

The end came for me on New Year's Day, 2011 - and it came on a toilet at The Hawthorns. It wasn't the way I'd have chosen to finish, but I knew for certain that this was my last game.

After 18 years at Manchester United, after 602 first-team appearances, I was in the middle of playing for my team for the last time.

And I couldn't wait for it to be over. In the dressing room, the manager was barking instructions about how we were going to improve on a dire first-half performance against West Brom.

But I just wanted to get home, to disappear. In the sanctuary of the toilet, my mind was elsewhere. I'd been really poor in the first half, but that hadn't stopped the fans singing my name.

'Gary Neville is a Red, is a Red…' For the first time in my life I'd been embarrassed to hear it. Don't sing that. I don't deserve it. Maybe in the past, but not today.

I was beating myself up even as the game was going on around me. 

What am I doing out here? How soon will this be over?

My mind was racing at a thousand miles an hour, full of doubts and vulnerabilities. This wasn't like me at all. I was normally full of drive and commitment and focus. Normally I'd be the one barking instructions, telling others to concentrate.

I'd prepared for every game in my life knowing that however much my opponent wanted it, I wanted it more.

But now all I could think was: 'Please get me out of here without making a terrible mistake.'

I'd known I wasn't right from the moment the manager pulled me over on the Thursday after training to tell me I was playing.

He wanted my experience, he said.

We'd been panicking a bit at the back, let in a sloppy late goal at Birmingham City a few days earlier. But this would be my first start for more than two months.

I'd not played since the trip to Stoke City the previous October, when I'd not exactly covered myself in glory. We'd won, but I should have been sent off for a scything tackle that was several minutes late.

I had made four appearances in four months and never felt properly fit. It had been a hard struggle with injury ever since my ankle went in 2007.

I'd been ready to bow out in the spring of 2010, so it caught me by surprise when the boss asked me to stay on for another year. I had my doubts, but I couldn't turn down the invitation.

Who wants to walk away from the job of your dreams? I signed on happily for another season, but the first day back in pre-season I pulled my calf. Then I pulled my groin, and then my ankle went again in the game at Stoke.

I was caught in a nasty Catch-22: I needed matches to regain my sharpness, but with Rafael starting to blossom as my long-term successor I knew the manager couldn't give me a run of games.

With my obsessive attention to detailed preparation - the right number of leg weights, sprints, stretches - I knew I wasn't ready.

Others might get away with cutting corners but, right through my career, if I wasn't in the right condition, I was half the player.

Then I saw Paul Scholes in the canteen after I'd spoken to the manager, I told him my fears. 'This is going to be messy,' I said.

He laughed.

'You don't mean Lionel.' Typical Scholesy, ready to take the mickey.

So now, at half-time against West Brom, I was staring at the toilet door and all my worst fears were coming true.

I was making Jerome Thomas look like Ronaldo. It would have been even worse if the referee had spotted my trip on Graham Dorrans in the box.

I deserved a red card; if justice had been done, my career would have finished there and then with a lonely, embarrassed walk to the dressing room.

I'd got off lightly, but I wasn't going to avoid the wrath of the manager at half-time.

I walked into a predictable, and deserved, blast for poor positioning. Perhaps sensing my troubles, Rio Ferdinand stuck up for me, offering to take the blame for one of West Brom's chances.

It was good of him to put his hand up because I didn't have the stomach to argue back at the manager.

All I wanted to do was get through that second half and get home.

Out of the toilet I came and, bizarrely, I enjoyed my 25 minutes after half-time. I felt a renewed sense of calm, probably from knowing it would soon be over.

My mind was back on the job, though my legs were still pleading for a rest.

I went for an attacking run, and it seemed to take all day to get back in position.

There was no chance of me lasting until the final whistle, and when the ball ran out of play near the bench, I saw Mick Phelan wander over for a word.

'You're f*****, aren't you?' 'Yes.'

Now the end was only seconds away.

I saw Rafael warming up, and soon the board was out - a big No 2, up in lights.

Off I went for the last time. I knew it was over. Gary Neville, the former Manchester United defender.

1360585069.0	18azue	RVP and the United way	usampo	182	18	19	"At approximately 16:46 on 10th February 2013 the Old Trafford faithful rose to their feet as Robin Van Persie beat an Everton offside trap. He charged at goal, opened up his body to place a shot with his left foot past Tim Howard only to drop his shoulder and round the keeper for the second time in the match. He then hit a right footed shot that a desperately retreating John Heitinga could do nothing about. United were now 2-0 up and by the end of the afternoon would move 12 points clear of their main title rivals: Manchester City. 

The goal represented a nice move by United but was, in itself, nothing particularly special and will certainly not feature on any goal of the season lists. However, through that goal one was given a glimpse into the psyche of this United squad and an idea of the mental strength that permeates it. 

Around 35 minutes earlier Van Persie had an almost identical opportunity to open the scoring for the reds. Much like his goal he dropped his shoulder and went around Tim Howard. However, on this occasion his normal composure and instincts escaped him and his shot cannoned off the Everton post. Later in the half as Van Persie rounded Howard for a second time opting not to finish with his favored left foot one could not help but think that he was proving a point.

Normal football logic and cliché would have one believe that the best strikers in the world do not think about their missed opportunities: they put them out of their minds and concentrate on their next opportunity that falls their way; confident in the knowledge that they will score. With Van Persie it seemed as though the opposite was true: he acknowledged his failings the first time around and, when a second opportunity presented itself to him, he took up the challenge of putting right what he had previously done wrong. 

This is a testament to the mental strength of Van Persie but also reflective of what is stirring within this current United squad. Last year’s title collapse should not have happened. With such a comfortable lead at the top of the table Manchester United should not have capitulated in such spectacular fashion. However, much like Van Persie, United will not let lightening strike twice. Rather than allow the thought of last years collapse escape their mind United appear to have their failure at the forefront of their mind and, as such, a new mental strength and belief has emerged that brings with it a determination to steamroll their way to success.

It is fitting symbolism that Van Persie’s goal came against Everton for two reasons. Firstly, this is the team against whom, one could argue, United’s collapse last season was truly cemented. In last season’s match United were 4-2 up when Patrice Evra hit the woodwork. A 5-2 lead would surely have meant a United win and, even with a defeat a Eastlands, a 20th Premier League title. However, with seven minutes left Everton fought back, scored two and the rest is history.

The second, and perhaps most fitting symbolism, is that yesterday’s match was the home game chosen to mark the anniversary of the Munich air disaster. When Sir Alex Ferguson gave his interview to BBC’s Football Focus this week he spoke of the way in which Manchester United has always faced challenges head on. He spoke of how Sir Matt rebuilt a decimated squad and, within ten years, had won a European cup. He also spoke of the way in which United must stand and face up to the challenge laid down by Manchester City. But perhaps most telling is when Sir Alex spoke about last years collapse: “That won’t happen again this year…it won’t happen. Trust me”.

United, it seems, like their new superstar have not let themselves forget about their failings, instead they have let it gnaw at them and allowed it to fester. It drives them on and has created an unparalleled determination to win.

The greatness of our club will be illuminated with various examples throughout history: the ’68 European Cup and the ’99 Treble being perhaps the most obvious. However, for me, the bravery, determination, and itch for perfection which saw Robin Van Persie send his side 12 points clear at the top of the Premier League is as much an epitome of what Manchester United is about as any trophy winning season.

Thought i'd go over some of the current premier league records (mostly set by Chelsea) and see what we can equal and beat this season. This is just to give some people a scope of just how well we have done this season in certain aspects. All based on a 38 game season.

Reposted after a few minutes because i got the year wrong :( 


**9 games left (4 home, 5 away)**



|Current amount|Record &amp; Holder|How to break/equal it|
|:---------------|:---------------|:----------------|
| 24 Wins Total |29 Wins - Chelsea|     Win 6 / 9 to set record 
|||Win 5 / 9 to equal record     
| 14 Home Wins |18 Wins - Multiple clubs|  Win all 4 to equal record
| 10 Away Wins | 15 Wins - Chelsea|  Win all 5 to equal record   

Winning 6 out of 9 games is very possible. What we see from this is our home and away form in terms of wins isn't record breaking on it's own, but combined it is (or can be) better than anyone previously.

|Current amount|Record &amp; Holder|How to break/equal it|
|:---------------|:---------------|:----------------|
| 2 Draws Total | 3 Draws - Chelsea| No more draws to set record
|||1 more draw to equal record
| 0 Home Draws| 0 Draws - Man City| No more home draws to equal record

We could potentially see us having the least amount of draws ever and equaling 0 draws at home too. Not the most impressive fact on it's own because it could show the team loses a lot, but coupled with what i expect to be a fantastic points and win return for the season its shows just how we can find different ways to score against teams, how we can 'grind out results' against teams others can't (i enjoy how some people try to say beating teams 1-0 when you would have drew instead is a bad thing).

|Current amount|Record &amp; Holder|How to break/equal it|
|:---------------|:---------------|:----------------|
| 74 points| 95 points - Chelsea| Gain 22 / 27 points to set record
|||Gain 21 / 27 points to equal record

Possibly the best statistic to look at. To be, points wise, the best team ever in the Premier League era would be astonishing. A real testament to the team and to the Manager especially if you consider the age and such of players like Rafael, Welbeck and De Gea, coupled with not exactly a world class CM or CB pairing either. 
  
To give a proper look at what the results need to look like:

|Wins|Draws|Loss| Result
|:--------|:---------|:-----------|:------|
|9|0|0| New Record - 101 Points.
|8|1|0| New Record - 99 Points
|8|0|1| New Record - 98 Points
|7|2|0| New Record - 97 Points
|7|1|1| New Record - 96 Points
|7|0|2| Equal Record - 95 Points
|6|3|0| Equal Record - 95 Points

Any other results and we do not equal or set the points total record.


****


**Fun Facts**: 

Should Manchester United beat City by 19 or more points, that will be our greatest ever title win over the second place team. Set by beating Arsenal by 18 points in 99/00

Chelsea set a record of only conceding 15 goals in a season in 04/05. Manchester United had conceded more by mid November!

Manchester United, after chasing the goals scored record for a while, now need to average just under 4 goals per game should they wish to beat Chelseas record of 103 goals in a season.

Should we wish to beat Chelseas record of 71 GD, Manchester United will need to have a GD of +35 in the next 9 games."	t5_2rxse	True

Seriously, most United fans on /r/soccer are just feeding into all this ABU shit and saying things just to get karma. United is one of the most envied teams from England and Europe because of their success and traditions. Don't feed into other clubs jealousy of United. Everyone, but there is no need to agree with some asinine opinion from some deranged Chelsea fan.

Die hard fans don't pander to their rivals comments. As for civility, you can still be objective, but come on, don't start throwing your team out in front of a bus because United are on the better end of a call.

I really get annoyed as a passionate fan when I see this, and I am sorry if I am coming off as being like devineman. At least he stands with his team through controversial things.

I don't expect a positive response to this sadly, but stop throwing United under a bus just to get some karma or pander to some Man City fan for example.

Just remember, they are jealous. Look at how we are dominating the league despite Chel$ki and Man $hitty massive spending/wages. Success breeds jealousy.

As much as it pains me to do so, I owe it to the spirit of football to drop in and congratulate you guys on a season well done. You dominated from the start and undeniably deserve the cup. 

While we over at r/liverpoolfc may never be able to bring ourselves to support Man U on game day, we cherish our relationship with you guys more than anything else. Rivalries are an important wrinkle in the world of competitive sports, and the Red Devils have proven to be a very worthy and capable rival.

So again, congrats! Have a drink tonight-you've earned it. There's no point in loving a team unless you can let loose when they succeed. Liverpool looks forward to seeing you on the pitch next season.

And please, for the sake of civility, please nobody mention Luis Suarez. We know...

I know it's early. I'm giddy.

We are 90 minutes away from a 20th title. K.O in 3 minutes. Lets doooo this.

And we're off.

1' GOAL!!!!! ROBIN VAN PERSIE. Rooney with a peach of a ball to Valencia on the right, who feeds Rafael, his high cross finds Giggs at the back post who fires across goal and RVP taps in. GREAT START. [GIF](http://i.minus.com/iisSMmMJu2lEy.gif) **Manchester United 1 - 0 Aston Villa**

2' RVP with another clear cut chance but he fires over.

[Weekly Piers Morgan strop](https://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/326411687102148608)

8' Giggs with a great change of pace, finds RVP who tries to head down for Kagawa, but it's cleared.

9' SO CLOSE. Ball is cleared to Rafa, urged to shoot by the crowd, and he obliges, and his 20 yard shot rattles the post. So unlucky.

11' Good counter from Villa, Benteke should have equalized, but his shot is over.

13' OH MY HOLY FUCK I THINK I NEED SOME NEW PANTS! GOOOOALLL!! ROBIN VAN PERSIE AGAIN!! Rooney with a stunning searching pass over the top for Van Persie, who doesn't bother to take it down, 25 yards out, he sends a STUNNING volley in to the far post. [GIF](http://i.minus.com/ino7gJku4KVEn.gif) **Manchester United 2 - 0 Aston Villa**

16' That was potential goal of the season. Holy shit I'm still taking it in. We could be 4 up already.

24' Not much to report apart from sloppy possession. We definitely look the more dangerous. 

28' Evra with a bad challenge and he's booked.

29' Evans signalling to the bench he's having problems. Rio is imminent.

30' Carrick and Rooney giving the ball away in quick succession. Unlike them.

33' GOAL. HAT TRICK. ROBIN VAN PERSIE. Giggs breaks and feeds RVP in the 6 yard box, he delays his shot, shuffles past the Villa players and fires in to the top corner. 33 minute hat trick, leading scorer in the PL.

41' Kagawa is pulling the strings in CM. 

44' Rooney playing deep has obviously been told to feed AV7. Most of his balls seem to be searching for him. Not all of them are successful...

45' 2 minutes of added time.

**Half time: Manchester United 3 - 0 Aston Villa**

(RvP, 1', 13', 33')

45' Back for the 2nd half. United quick out of the blocks.

50' RVP with a goal line clearance. 

52' Rooney dispossessed and Benteke fires a low shot goalwards, good save DDG.  

60' Jones having a blinder at CB. Half an hour until we are Champions.

63' Great play by AV7 on the right who feeds Giggs, who lays it off for Rooney but his shot is blocked. He gets a second attempt from a RVP squares it but its over.

70' Evans nearly scores from a corner. Close.

71' SUB: Rooney OFF, Welbeck ON.

74' Kagawa has a half hearted penalty shout waved away.

75' DDG with a fine save from a dipping shot.

77' OH SHINJI. Kagawa sets himself up amazingly for a 1 on 1 with Guzan after great work from AV7. He skies his shot, he SHOULD have scored. No doubt.

80' AV7 having a great game down the right. FINALLY.

85' Every pass getting cheered by our fans. OhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhWHEY!

87' We are 3 minutes away.

90' We're at the 90 minute mark. 2 minutes of added time.

91' 30 seconds to go.

**Full time: Manchester United 3 - 0 Aston Villa**

(RvP, 1', 13', 33')

[link] (http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2189954/Ben-Foster-trainer-fetish-football-hero-Paul-Scholes.html)

**Who is your sporting hero?**

Paul Scholes, as weird as that might sound. It was him before I signed for Manchester United. And it was still him when I left. He is the best player you will ever see. Ask any of the players at Old Trafford. He’s a joke. He was that good.

This is not a made-up story. It’s my very first session for Manchester United and the lads are practising their passing. I just watched them, for a minute in-between my own drills. They were hitting diagonals, 40-50 yards.

Someone has rolled this ball into Scholesy. It’s bounced just before he could make contact - a really nasty bounce. He’s altered his body shape in the blink of an eye and just smashed this ball. It did not wobble in the air. It went like a bullet, four feet off the ground for 50 yards and Giggsy or whoever just did not move. They chested it down and off they went.

I said: ‘Bloody hell...did you see that?' to the goalkeeping coach at the time who was Tony Coton. He had his back to what was going on. He couldn’t have seen what had happened. No way.
He didn’t turn around. He just went: ‘That was Scholesy, wasn’t it?'

Paul Scholes is a football genius.

1368861049.0	1ekf9r	On Jose Mourinho and David Moyes.	deepit6431	120	13	51	"There were two major opinions on this subreddit when our new manager wasn't announced. David Moyes, and Jose Mourinho.

And I will admit that I was firmly in the Mourinho camp, so much so that I was a tad disappointed when Moyes was unveiled.

After some time has passed, I have not a single doubt in my mind that Jose Mourinho would have been terrible for United. Absolutely terrible.

After Madrid's loss to Atletico yesterday, he apparently said these words in the press conference:

&gt;This is the worst season of my career. I only won one unimportant title. What would have been the best season in the career of other managers, for me is the worst.

He then went on to blame the players for missing the penalties in the Semi-Final vs Bayern last year, saying ""the manager does not take the penalties"".

I was always a big fan of Mourinho, and to be honest I still am. He's a bastard, but he's a likeable bastard. I find his antics very entertaining, and his talent and prestige is unquestionable. However, for nothing would I want the man at Old Trafford. 

The league win and parade have been revelatory in the way Manchester United is run. Like Carrick said, you don't just play for this club, you live for it. Manchester United is a family. A family where people look out for each, cover each others' backs, and stick together.

I don't remember if it was Giggs or Neville, but one senior player said sometime ago that they were expected to take care of the young guys. When a young squad member fell into some trouble one night, Sir Alex blasted the senior players for not telling him. He reportedly asked players to phone him as soon as they saw a whiff of trouble. He'd blast them or fine them later, but he'd take care of them first. 

And I don't remember a source for this, but I vividly remember reading that if someone was fined, the whole team was fined, or at least the senior players. Sir Alex's reasoning being that the people who allowed the player to do wrong were as liable as the person who did something wrong.

Sir Alex has given a major part of his life to us, and he's taken a lot of pains to build up this culture at the club. And it would be a damn shame if it was to be destroyed within a season by Jose. 

There's a major reason I hope Scholes stays in the backroom staff, that Phil Neville comes as well, that one day Gary Neville takes up a job at United. That I'm glad Rio will be there for another year. These are people into whom this culture is ingrained. These are people who know what Manchester United is all about. Manchester United is about winning, yes. But Manchester United is also about family.

And it is very important, that in this period of transition, this culture permeates down into our new players and staff. That whoever Moyes brings in, or indeed Moyes himself, understands this. As long as we don't forget who we are, the success will come.

Would Jose have been more successful than Moyes right away? It's impossible to tell when neither have managed us, but I still think so. 

Is David Moyes the better man for Manchester United? Undoubtedly.

**tl;dr: Mourinho bad, Moyes good.**"	t5_2rxse	True

Kick off! United kicking left to right. Sorry for the lack of updates.

3' Ronaldo tries to do a Ronaldo free kick. Hits the wall.

7' Corner for Madrid. 

7' Cleared by RVP.

11' Great play from RM. One touch football all over the pitch, but Higuain can't find the finish.

13' Corner for United after a Nani cross. Poor corner from RVP though and it's cleared.

15' A good cross from Giggs finds RVP but his volley is blocked. Very good play, and it's promising. 

18' Great play from Nani and Welbeck to release Nani down the left. Managed to be cleared by Varane.

19' Giggs shows no sign of age. Wins a corner after winning a battle with Contraeo.

20' SO CLOSE! Vidic's header rattles the post, and Welbeck can't find the net from the rebound.

25' RM turn for pressure. Ronaldo having no joy on the left, what a shame...

28' Great game, and great play from our players. Ronaldo was nearly in after beating the offside trap but his shot is blocked, we respond by piling men forward. Great pressure.

29' Corner for RM.

30' De Gea deals with it.

31' Carrick with an important interception to prevent a certain Ronaldo goal. Corner.

32' Dealt with with De Gea AGAIN. 

32' RM have the ball in our net but a foul against Ramos had already been given. But Ramos is on the floor in 'agony'? Shock!!

33' A great ball finds RVP who rifles a shot at an angle, who rifles it at Lopez who can only parry into the feet of Welbeck but Lopez with a 2nd save denies him.

34' Vidic was punched in the face from the resulting corner by Lopez. He's down.

36' Rafa has a penalty appeal waved away after a tussle with thundercunt Sergio Ramos.

41' Our old nemesis, Kaka, is ready to come on.

44' I feel that someone has a remote that controls Danny Welbeck. The remote only has 2 buttons. One is labelled 'World class' and the other says 'Bambi walking on ice'. During build up, the 'world class' button is pressed. As soon as he gets near the box or is closed down, the other button is pressed.

45' 1 minute of added time.

**Half-time. Manchester United 0 - 0 Real Madrid. (1-1)**

And we're back.

46' GOOOOAAAALLLL!!!! OWN GOAL BY SERGIO FUCKING RAMOS!!! A great run from Rafa, feed Welbeck, shot is blocked, and it's rescued by Nani who's cross is put past Lopez by Ramos. **Manchester United 1 - 0 Real Madrid**

50' Spells of RM pressure now, not much has changed for them, they needed to score anyway. 

53' A good cross darts across DDG's goal, but no RM player attacks.

56' RED CARD?!!?!?! WHAT THE FLYING FUCK?? Nani has been SENT OFF for a high boot? That is GARBAGE. We now have to play 33 minutes with 10 MEN!! 

59' SAF is bellowing at the crowd, waving his arms to get them behind the team and the decibel level in OT is IMMENSE.

61' Rafa with a goal line clearance from a Varane header.

63' Relentless RM pressure. We wont be able to see out another 30 minutes of this.

66' GOAL. Modric equalises for RM with a good strike. **Manchester United 1 - 1 Real Madrid (2-2)**

69' GOAL. Ronaldo puts Madrid in front, no celebration, he almost looked guilty. We need to score TWICE. **Manchester United 1 - 2 Real Madrid (2-3)**

72' SUB UNITED. Rooney ON, Cleverley OFF.

78' 12 minutes plus stoppages and i'm sorry everyone, but this doesn't look good.

79' SUB UNITED. Young ON, Welbeck OFF.

82' Carrick has a great header saved my Lopez from a corner.

83' If there was a chance of scoring 2 goals against RM, the big chance was right there. RVP and Rooney both missing chances. Great effort from our players.

86' RM are in control. The extra man is so obvious.

87' SUB UNITED. Valencia ON, Rafa OFF.

89' Diego Lopez is 'injured' after a shoulder barge from RVP. He was fine to throw the ball out but then collapsed. Horrible tactic.

90' 5 minutes added.

91' Vida with a thumping header saved. Lopez has been good for RM tonight.

94' This just wasn't possible with 10 men. Valiant effort from United.

95' And it's over.

***
SAF, Phil Neville and David Gill in attendance at Moss Lane
***
**KICK OFF**
***
**5'** - Good cross from the right by Veseli but Tunnicliffe fails to connect to it. Despite the bad pitch, lively game.
***
**8'** - Good attack from Arsenal, perfect block by Reece Brown to save the day.
***
**10'** - **GOAL** for Arsenal. **Chuba Akpom** nicely cuts in the penalty and scores a pretty good goal. **0-1**
***
**14'** - **GOAL** For MUFC. **Nick Powell** levels the score. Good header from a free kick cross. **1-1**
***
**19'** - Tom Thorpe with a free header from a corner, but an Arsenal defender clears it.
***
**21'** - **GOAL** for MUFC. **Lingard** finishes off a brilliant counter attacking move. **2-1** 

*dat counter!*
***
**25'** - Woodwork!! Vermijl combines nice on the left wing, cuts inside, crosses to Tunnicliffe who volleys into the woodwork and into out. Beautiful football from our young guns!
***
**29'** - **GOAL** for Arsenal. Amos only manages to parry a shot from distance and **Akpom** scores the rebound.  **2-2**
***
**31'** - United try to respond quickly and a free kick is barely cleared by Arsenal, appeals for a handball from United players, but they're waved on by the ref.
***
**36'** - **Sub MUFC** - McGinty replaces Veseli (who seems to have picked an injury)
***
**45+2'** - AFC's number 7 shoots from the edge of the area just wide, decent shot.
***
**HALF TIME** - Entertaining game, both teams dangerous on the attack. Fare result so far.
***
**SECOND HALF** is under way.
***
**47'** - Early AFC pressure wins them a corner, but it's cleared safely away.
***
**52'** - AFC continue to be productive, a free kick goes out for a corner, the corner is dealt with by the United defense.
***
**60'** - **Yellow card** for Ben Amos, who was outside his penalty area trying to head out a long ball, but caught the Arsenal player with his elbow. Results in a free kick for AFC in a very dangerous position.
***
**62'**  - Poor freekick from Arsenal and it's out.
***
**64'** - Now United have a FK in a good position, near the corner flag. Lots of bodies in the area but it's cleared.

***
**70'** - Akpom almost gets his hattrick, but his header is just above the cross bar. Danger man.
***
**80'** - 10 minutes to go, tempo a bit slower now, Arsenal having most of the possession and United looking for a quick break
***
**87'** - **Yellow Card** for Januzaj, who chases after an Arsenal striker that's getting away and fouls him just in front of the penalty area. Freekick is close, but wide.

***
**FULL TIME - 2:2** Fair result.

There's not much left to be said for the events of yesterday's game, so I'll leave that out.

There are, however, positives to take away. Our young crop has been quite heavily criticized. Welbeck, Cleverley, De Gea, Rafael, and Jones have all had their abilities questioned. And these two legs against Madrid were where our boys became men.

I'll take this player-by-player:

##David De Gea

**First leg**: Possibly our man of the match. An unbelievable performance from him, showing why he is undoubtedly our no.1 for decades to come. And we can literally get decades out of him. His save against Coentrao's shot was simply inhuman. His scissor kick was fantastic. He nullified the threat of Madrid's long shots, because he can take those all day. He showed 'em. David De Gea is the real deal.

**Second leg**: It is a testament to our defence yesterday that this man had so little to do. Pulled off a couple of run of the mill saves, and can't be blamed at all for either goal. It was one of the very few times this season his defence has rendered him unnecessary, and that's great to see. 



##Tom Cleverley 

**First leg**: Was not involved

**Second leg**: Some would say he had a quiet game, but fact is, he was brilliant. It's just the fact that others were so much better. He did his job perfectly, and it didn't help that he was played out of position, a little deeper than he's comfortable with. He also marked Alonso to perfection, and did a stellar job all around.

He didn't exactly shine, but it wasn't his job and he wasn't given a chance to. He did his job, and he did it well. Solid.

And lest I remind you, this is a young player against arguably the second best midfield in the world - he faced players like Oezil, Khedira, Alonso, Di Maria, and Ronaldo, and matched them play for play. That is no mean feat.



##Phil Jones:

**First leg**: Is there anything this man can *not* do? I think we should stick him up front for a game, just to see how he does. Almost single handedly kept the best player in the world [;)] out of the game at the Bernabeu. Keeping Cristiano Ronaldo in your pocket is something to put on your grave, and this man did it so well. A perfect team player, he knows he's sacrificing his chances playing at such a thankless position, but he does it with so much heart. And this man is *21 years of age*. He is still going to get so much better. There are so many  good things to come from Jonesy. Future captain? Maybe. And he is *adorable*. I want to give him a hug.

**Second leg**: Sadly wasn't involved due to injury



##Rafael Da Silva

**First leg**: Had an unsettled first half where Ronaldo sometimes made him look bad, but recovered magnificently. Had a much better second half, where he solidified his claim as the best young right back in the world right now, who will be counted among the greatest when he does fully develop. Wonderful threat going forward, has stepped up his defensive game considerably, and an invaluable asset to any squad.

**Second leg** Holy fuck. What was that? That is, I think, the best I've seen Rafael play in a red shirt. He ran is heart out. I don't think I've ever seen a player give more than Rafael gave yesterday. He was simply tireless, running up and down at the speed of light. Given probably the hardest job of marking Ronaldo, I must say he did much better than I expected him to. Ronaldo wasn't himself yesterday, and Rafael (along with Giggs) played a large part in it. Anyone who says Rafael can't defend should be shown yesterday's game, because he did it against the most dangerous player in the game. 

And despite that, despite all the defending he had to do, he managed to be a threat going forward, making runs to put Coentrao off and playing a large part in the goal. I feel for him more than many, because while every player gave their heart and soul yesterday, Rafael was *sublime*. He will touch great heights, I think we all know.



##Danny Welbeck

**First and Second legs**: No use differentiating them. I think it speaks volumes when, in a Manchester United side having Rooney, Giggs, Carrick and Nani, I think Welbeck was our best player on the pitch in both matches. This man is *fast*. Sometimes too much for his own good, but causing Madrid's defense problems is no mean feat. His intelligence in build up is second to none, he was doing the offensive part of Rooney's role yesterday and he was doing it so well. He's taken his time to come into his own, but now I think he has. More than any, Welbeck became a man against Madrid. He showed the world what he's capable of, and why Sir Alex has faith in him, and why he will be a part of Manchester United for years to come. 

And, as /u/fallark points out, his defensive contributions to mark Alonso were beyond his years.

His deficiencies are also more obvious than others, though. His finishing definitely needs to get better, but I have no doubt it will. And, to steal someone's comment from yesterday, he has the tendency to go 'Bambi on Ice' sometimes. But he is young, and he will learn. And if he can threaten Madrid at this age, think of what he can do when he is young.

And finally,



##Ryan Giggs

Honestly, if I didn't know shit about football yesterday, and I missed all the white hair somehow, I'd Ryan Giggs was this new lad with blistering pace who's going to be Manchester United's star for years to come (which he still might just do). Where does his pace come from? This man is **thirty fucking nine** years of age, and he was, on occasion, faster than 11 year younger Ronaldo and 15 year younger Coentrao. He took Coentrao to school yesterday. Absolutely rubbed the pitch with him. This is the best I've seen Giggs play in a while, and boy did he play his heart out. He gave it all. You could see the leadership, see the absolute legend he is at United when he pumped the crowd up, as only he can. He is the definition of a living legend if there ever was one, a man who defies all modern notions of age. 

At one point, Giggs ran back from the half line to tackle Ronaldo, who was running forward. Successfully. That is all you need to know about his performance yesterday.



##Conclusion

We have some exciting times in coming years. This is possibly the last squad Sir Alex will build, and though many questioned it's quality until this season, I don't think there can be any doubt now. Our crop of players have quality, have determination, have skill and have heart. But most importantly, *they do not give up*. They *never* gave up. And that, more than anything, made me proud of them yesterday. Because we're Manchester United, and that's what we do.  

The Champions League may not be ours this season, but it's not too far away."	t5_2rxse	True

14' Ronaldo wins a corner for RM. But it's over everyone and out for a throw at the other end.

22' RM pressure now. Di Maria with another low shot. 

24' This ref doesn't know what he's doing. RVP given away a free kick for seemingly nothing.

26' A lot of RM corners that are dealth with. If we manage to go the rest of this game without conceding I will be over the moon.

27' Carrick fouls Ronaldo. We're about to face 'the' Ronaldo free kick for the first time. Andddd he hits the wall. Rebound shot is wide.

29' GOAL! Cristiano Ronaldo with an amazing header levels the game. No celebration from him. **Real Madrid 1 - 1 Manchester United**

48' Ronaldo with a shot straight at De Gea. 

50' Ronaldo brought down by Jones in the centre circle.

51' Di Maria seems to enjoy shooting from long range. He fires a shot but De Gea is behind it.

84' SUB UNITED: Rooney OFF, Anderson ON. 

85' Jones concedes a free kick. Needless.

85' Ronaldo belts it, very Ronaldo-esque. De Gea doesn;t move but it hits the roof of the net. Phew.

87' Sergio Ramos goes down again after a challenge from AV7. After approx. 9.5 rolls on the floor, AV7 gets booked.

90' There will be 3 added minutes.

91' In two minutes time, Phil Jones will take Cristiano Ronaldo out of his pocket. Great effort to stop him from stealing the win.

                   De Gea               
     
    Rafael     Vidic      Evans     Evra

               Jones    Carrick         

    Valencia       Kagawa           Nani

                   Rooney               

Really highlights our weakness in deep midfield. Jones has to act as a worse Martinez. If Valencia can do anything still, it's pressing. And contrary to popular belief, Nani also works hard on defense. Rather than Munich's inverted wingers, we see Valencia as Blaszczykowski and Nani as Reus/Ribery. Rooney favoured over RVP because he works harder to press. Back in the day, Rooney had Mandzukic levels of defensive workrate but he still puts in his shift. Carrick is Schweini, Kagawa is Kagawa. Evans favoured in defense because he brings some pace needed to play a high line.

----

**Italian Narrow 3-5-2, 5-3-2** (slow, narrow buildup with width coming from wingbacks, mainly Juventus and Napoli)



                   De Gea               
     
         Smalling   Vidic    Evans      

    Rafael         Carrick          Evra

            Anderson    Cleverley       

             van Persie   Rooney        

I've always wanted us to try 3/5 in the back, just for funsies. Defense is standard 3 men deep, nothing against Ferdinand but Smalling and Evans can cover more ground. Rafael and Evra hug the touchline and provide the width. Much more freedom to go forward than before with 3 dedicated players back. Carrick runs the offense, similar to Pirlo. He sits deep and doesn't need to worry about midfield pressure because the runners in front of him, Anderson and Cleverley, shuttle box-to-box. Less defensive than Vidal and Marchisio but it'll do. No Hamsik role, just two strikers both working the frontline.

----

**Real Madrid Counter 4-2-3-1** (reactive, sit deep then break quickly with inverted wingers)

                   De Gea               
     
    Rafael     Vidic      Evans     Evra

               Jones    Carrick         

    Nani           Kagawa          Young

                 van Persie             

We could actually do well with this. Defense sits deep with both midfielders sitting in front. Absorb then break. Kagawa suits the counter already and fulfills Ozil's role. Carrick sits deep and launches the ball to the wingers or to the CAM. Nani and Young both like to cut inside but severely lack the quality of Ronaldo and di Maria. Robin van Persie is better than Benzema and Higuain. To make this really work, we'd need to get a dedicated DM to partner Carrick. One who is positionally aware. We'd also need more consistent wingers since wingers act as auxiliary forwards. They do not necessarily need to press, just need to be able to drop deep to cover the wings. 

----

**Tiki-taka 4-3-3** (retain possession in midfield before finding an opening then on defense, press high and be proactive)


                   De Gea               
     
    Rafael     Vidic      Evans     Evra

                   Carrick              

            Anderson     Cleverley      

                   Kagawa               

            Welbeck        Rooney       

Damn, we'd really suck at trying to emulate tiki-taka. Carrick's fine, he can be Busquets. Anderson and Cleverley just aren't as good as Xavi and Iniesta. Cleverley's positional awareness is actually pretty decent but he lacks the vision of Xavi and Iniesta. Anderson just can't keep possession. Kagawa plays the false nine because he's more slippery than Rooney. Rooney is better served as David Villa (before the injury). We don't have a good Pedro, someone who sneaks behind the defense and can retain possession. Chicharito has better movement than Pedro but he can't play possession football. Our forwards definitely cannot play tiki-taka.

                   De Gea

I have noticed a large number of threads asking about how they can get tickets for games, what pubs are good, what they can do in the area, all that. I'm not a pro at all this information because I don't usually buy individual tickets or sleep in hotels nearby, so my information might not be 100% accurate, but I'm sure it will be helpful.

***

**Tickets:** The main reason why people visit. Watching United is an amazing experience, and definitely not a cheap one so be prepared for that. 



[Buying tickets](https://www.eticketing.co.uk/muticketsandmembership/default.aspx)

After doing some snooping, once you pick the game you want to see, pick your seats, click the drop down box and choose 'Adult' or '18-20' '(None member)' This adds an extra £5 for being none-members. Expensive though, for fairly OK seats against West Ham, it just quoted me for over 100 quid. Ouch. Note: I only checked this for PL games.

 For CL games it might be a completely different kettle of fish. League Cup games i'm sure you'll be fine for as there's generally less interest unless it's City/Liverpool/Arsenal/Chelsea/Leeds.

*Tip:* I would do my best to avoid the bottom right part of the South stand. I've sat there a few times before and it's silent, all you get it stick from the away fans. It's embarrassing.

If you do choose to be a member, it gets you ticket priority for future games. This will involve paying a membership fee. You'll get £5 off ticket prices and get a membership kit. Not ideal but it's the easiest way to get tickets for games you want to see.

Tickets are sold on a first come first served basis. I'd advise you book the tickets a few weeks in advance, to guarantee sitting next to friends/family. United's fanbase is huge as you know, so you can imagine, for example, it will be very difficult to get Stretford End seating due to the masses of people all wanting to sit in the same stand, even for a game like United vs Stoke.  I doubt that people coming over will be too bothered about that though

- For 18-20 year olds, tickets vary from £23.00 to £39.50

- For Adults (20-65) tickets vary from £30.00 to £52.00.

**Match day**

I'm assuming you want a few pints inside you and as you should NEVER buy beer inside the ground, a couple of places pop into my head.

[Sam Platt's](http://www.qype.co.uk/place/85959-Sam-Platts-Manchester)


Absolutely bouncing before a match. Singing and drinking. It's just down the road from the stadium and has a huge gazebo outside where the singing takes place. Good for a few and a sing song before the game.

Also famous for it's United worshipping atmosphere:

[Bishops Blaize](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?hl=en&amp;q=bishops+blaize&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;bpcl=35466521&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wl&amp;authuser=0)

A quick YouTube search of this place will give you all the information you need...

Obviously other people can post where they go before matches below.

**Tips:**

Either go to the toilet before you leave for the game or find somewhere before you get inside the stadium! At half time the queue for the toilets is ridiculous, as many people pile out 5 minutes before HT to get there first, which I find ridiculous. 

If you want some snacks or something to eat during the game like chocolate or whatever, buy some cheap in a shop before you go and smuggle it in your pocket. Don't buy anything from inside the stadium. It's ridiculously overpriced.

***

**Staying over**

I have absolutely no idea about hotels in Manchester, I live here so i've never had to do it. Hopefully people with experience in it can comment below with suggestions. 

***

**Stuff you can do in the area**

There's not an abundance of stuff you can do in Manchester. Shit I feel like a travel guide. 

If you're feeling proper United-y you could book a tour of Old Trafford and entry to the museum. I've been, it's very good. You get to walk down the tunnel, go in the changing room. Top stuff: 

[Manchester United museum and stadium tour](http://www.manutd.com/en/Visit-Old-Trafford/Museum-And-Stadium-Tour/Welcome.aspx)

You could check out Rio's restaurant:

[Rosso](http://www.restaurantsofmanchester.com/italian/rosso.htm), 

heard nothing but good things about it, apparently there's plenty of celebs that visit aswell.

I've said it once I'll say it again

[The Trafford Centre](http://www.traffordcentre.co.uk/)

So many shops, so many restaurants. Cinema, mini golf, laser tag. Easily make a day out of it. Food wise...Italian, Mexican, Chinese, fast food, and a lot more I'm just not gunna name it all...

You may enjoy skiing or snowboarding! So take a visit to 

[Chill Factor^e](http://www.chillfactore.com/)

Th longest indoor skiing and snowboarding slope in the UK. I've been, (with no experience skiing or snowboarding) and I loved it. You can have a lesson, or you can just go on the toboggan, or slide down in a inflatable ring, whatever you want. There is a number of restaurants in there as well. 

Next to that is indoor skydiving, where you float on a very powerful fan. Never been, but looks awesome.

[Airkix](http://www.airkix.com/our-tunnels/airkix-manchester.aspx).

This is all in the same area by the way, i'm not sending you miles away.  

There's also a few museums, if that's your thing.

[Museum of Science and Industry](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?hl=en&amp;tab=wl&amp;authuser=0)

[Imperial war Museum](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?hl=en&amp;tab=wl&amp;authuser=0)

[National football museum](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?hl=en&amp;tab=wl&amp;authuser=0)

***

I hope this has been sort of informative, i'll stick it in the sidebar for future use. Please, if you've visited Manchester as a tourist, comment on what you did and what you enjoyed so that Redditor United fans can see that stuff has been tried and tested by someone else and that you enjoyed it. Please take a look at the comments below as fellow Reds have posted things that may interest you during your stay.

Oh yeah, bring a coat + umbrella. Our weather is SHIT.

Enjoy!

Found a post in a Manchester United forum 5 years ago, that I thought would be neat to share here on r/soccer. They interviewed Park Ji-Sung's father Park Sung-Jong for a Korean article and someone translated it.

Translated by user: ""Choi Da-Hoon"" from [manutd.com](http://community.manutd.com/forums/t/45264.aspx?PageIndex=4)

Introduction

Manchester United's defender Patrice Evra and Ji Sung Park are best friends. Not only on the pitch but more notably off the pitch, as Evra frequently likes to visit Park. The interaction between them has brought the pair closer together, almost like brothers. Evra even calls Park's father, Park Sung Jong, Papa. Living in England, the two players have become very dependent on each other as they overcame their difficulties together. Park Sung Jong now reveals the untold stories of the pair.

Park Sung Jong-

When utd have a game abroad our house becomes a gathering point. Because the parking is expensive at the airport, several players come to our house so that they can catch a ride from me to the airport. Pat, Carlito, VDS, and Berba are the usual customers as well as Ji. I always get nervous when I drive them because I'm escorting a team of superstars and their combined cost is over 40 million!! Therefore, I have to always be alert and at my best and try not to think about crashing! But Evra is always at my side cracking his usual jokes and that gets rid of any worries. When we won the EPL ,Evra was the first one to come and hug me and my wife and take a picture with us. Also, he always calls me papa. That's how close we are, like a family.

Evra is a French international, but he is actually from Senegal. He grew up in the back streets of Les Ulis, a place populated with gangsters. However, it was football that prevented Evra from going down that road. I think Theirry Henry was from that region too.

Evra and Park are of same age. Evra is a bit more sociable than Ji, but both don't talk much and both are introspective. Whether its Ruud Van Nistelrooy of the past or Edwin Van der Sar of today, most of Ji's friends are from abroad, outside of Uk. British players usually hang out with each other and so the foreign players usually cluster together and depend upon each other.

Two years ago in the summer of 2007, during the Asian Tour, Evra was able to visit Korea. The day before the game, he came over to our house in Suwon. In Machester, he always asked us if he could vist our home in Korea if he had the chance. Therefore, he seized the opportunity when utd came to Korea to come and visit us. Not only did he look around our house, but he also begged Ji if he could take him to a nightclub in Seoul. Ji had never been to a night club in his life until the day he gave in to Evra's wishes.

Evra and Ji first met not as friends but as enemies back in 2005. They clashed in the round of 16 in the Champions League, Park playing for PSV and Evra playing for AS Monaco. In the two legs, Ji played on the right side of midfield and Evra played as left back and so both of them were frequently in battle. Eventually, PSV won both games 1-0 and 2-0. Evra sometimes reminisces about that game. He joked ""I had my butt kicked around all night by Ji and so I didn't really feel like being friends with him.""  ""I held a grudge over him."" Surprisingly, both Ji and Evra remember that game very well. I believe it was destiny for both of them to become best friends.

When Evra first arrived back in January of 2006, he had difficulties adjusting to the team. At that time, Mikael Silvestre and Gabriel Heinze cemented their places ahead of Evra and there was no room for Evra to break through. Whenever he had the chance to play, he made mistakes and that cost him his place. He was so into attacking that he sometimes forgot his defensive duties and left his marker free to roam. Unfortunately, he was dubbed the ""full back that never returns"" by some sections of utd fans. During those difficult periods, it was Ji that consoled Evra and gave him a shoulder to lean on. Ji told Evra about the difficult times he experienced back in Netherlands and tried to give him the confidence that he needed.

We became even closer friends with Evra when we moved right next to his house on February, 2007. Whenever Evra's wife, Patricia (funny Evra's first name is Patrice and his wife's first name is Patricia), takes her kids to visit relatives in France, Evra comes to our house and settles in as if it is his home. Sometimes, he invites Ji to his house and they spend time together. I think that's how Evra repays the kindness Ji has given him. When Ji had a surgery on his left ankle, I remember Evra writing a get well message on his cast. When Ji had a surgery on his right knee in the Spring of 2007, Evra dedicated the goal he scored in the 7-1 thrashing of Roma to Ji.

Evra's father lives in Dakar, Senegal. Evra says that, because his father married so many times, whenever he goes back to his home town, there is an Evra here, an Evra there and Evra Evra everywhere. Evra's father usually stays in Senegal, but he came to visit Manchester one day. Evra was so excited about the prospect of playing in front of his father at Old Trafford. However, Ferguson decided to put Evra on the bench and after the game Evra was extremely upset. He held his anger inside but when he got home he exploded. He screamed and started throwing things to the ground. It was obvious he wanted to make his father proud. I looked at Evra and thought ""what if that happened to Ji?"" Ji rarely reveals his feelings in front of me. He usually hides it. However, I could tell he was extremely disappointed when he missed out on the chance to play in the CL final last year. Sometimes, I wish Ji would be more expressive of his feelings like Evra.

Last year, we moved into the house Evra used to live. It is three stories with seven rooms. Evra also moved about 3-4 minutes away from our house. When Ji goes to training, he and Evra usually share a car. One day it wiil be Ji driving and the next day it is Evra. When training is over, the two of them sometimes go to a Korean restaurant to eat.

Evra's love for Utd is strong. He got a highly profitable offer from Inter Milan but he immediately turned it down. Whenever he plays a football video game with Ji, I have never seen him select a team other than Utd.

Now they are in the CL final together again. A few days ago, Evra told Ji ""Hey friend, last year  we didn't get to play with each other, but this time lets do this together. Remember, if either of us score, we must celebrate together. Evra is a really good friend of Ji."	t5_2rxse	True

Anyway, lately I've become sick to death of United supporters slagging on Danny. If you don't like Danny Welbeck, you don't understand what Manchester United is all about. This is a life-long United supporter, from Manchester, who, above all else, has committed his life, not to mention soul, to the club. THIS is the type of player I want at the club, THIS is the type of player that typifies our club. Anyone who would rather have Aguero or the like, a player who would be equally happy to win trophies regardless of the club he won them for, can fuck off. When Danny Welbeck lifts the Premier League trophy this year, he'll lift it for the club, not for himself. 

Maybe it's a symptom of supporters who haven't been around long enough, or don't know enough about the history of the club, but this club was built on players and managers who were playing for Manchester United, not for the bottom line. Danny Welbeck is one of those players."	t5_2rxse	True

We couldn't get tickets (they were quite expensive or sold out, I forget), but they were scheduled to have an open training session at a nearby stadium. So my sister (who is an Arsenal fan, but I'll forgive her that), grabbed me and a shite camera (it may have been one of those single-use ones) and she took some pictures of the whole thing, which I've uploaded to Imgur. Sorry about the quality, but this was 1998 and we were never rich. 

http://imgur.com/a/rntMb

The order of the pictures is probably off since I've just scanned them, and there may be a few missing. I've tried to label them with player names but there are a few faces I just don't recognise, would love some help with that. We showed up a bit late so the training session had begun, but after that we waited for about 2 hours for the players to get dressed and head to the team bus, and I got quite a few autographs. Not sure where they are though... 

Anyway, I think it's amazing to look at these pictures now, **because this is a pre-season friendly in the fucking treble-winning season**. Who would have thought, back in August of that year, that those players would win the league, the FA Cup and the Champions League?

**Team news:**


* United have gone 84 matches across all competitions (58 in the Premier League) without a goalless draw.
Wayne Rooney's penalty at Reading was their 1,000th Premier League goal since the turn of the century - the first club to reach this milestone.

* Rooney has scored eight goals in Manchester derby matches in all competitions. Only Sir Bobby Charlton (nine) has ever scored more for United against City. The outright most goals ever by a player in this fixture is 10, set by Franny Lee and Joe Hayes.

* The Red Devils have conceded the opening goal 15 times in 23 matches this season. But they came back to win against Reading for the seventh time in the league, a record for a Premier League season.

Most of our loan players should be playing some part today.

* **Fabio** - QPR vs Norwich City [12:45] - After a number of stand out performances and becoming QPR's first choice LB he had a mixed game last weekend. He [scored his first goal for the club](http://youtu.be/KOxYIbULOiU?t=3m23s) but it was just a consolation as the team as a whole put in a disappointing performance and lost 4-2 at home to MK Dons in the FA Cup. Played out of position on the right wing against City midweek and put in a relatively solid performance as they gained a valuable point in an impressive 0-0 home draw. Interestingly QPR signed Korean left back Yun Suk-young during the week but considering his lack of Premier League experience I'm pretty sure Fabio will stay ahead of him in the pecking order. Should start. **Confirmed starting.** **[MATCH REPORT](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21209130)**

* **Henriquez** - Wigan vs Southampton [15:00] - Played the full 90 minutes of the 1-0 away win against Macclesfield Town in the FA Cup last weekend. He did OK but it was always going to be a tough game for him. The pitch was very poor and it just wasn't the type of game you expect to see a silkily skilled, pacey south American excel in. Didn't play any part in the midweek draw with Stoke. Should make a late substitute appearance. **Confirmed on the bench.** **[MATCH REPORT](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21209221)**

* **Zaha** - Crystal Palace vs Charlton Athletic [15:00] - This will be the first time United fans really get to see him play since he signed(he did play midweek but the match clashed with United's). Should start. **Confirmed starting.** **[MATCH REPORT](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21209444)**

* **Petrucci and Wooton** - Peterborough United vs Burnley [15:00] - Both players have now signed extended loan contracts until the end of the season. Wootton has been very impressive, Petrucci slightly less so but this is his first loan move and it may take him some time to find his feet. Both expected to play some part today. **Petrucci confirmed on the bench, Wootton not even on the bench.**

* **Macheda** - Fortuna Dusseldorf vs Stuttgart [14:30] - Could make his Bunesliga debut for Stuttgart today. [Fergie has been praying for him to finally secure a fruitful loan move.](http://mancunianmatters.co.uk/content/01028338-sir-alex-fergusons-prays-manchester-uniteds-federico-macheda-finally-secure-fruitfu) Should play some part today. **Confirmed on the bench.**

* **Bebe** - Rio Ave vs Sporting CP [18:00] - Expecting nothing less than a MOTM performance and a hat-trick...maybe even two hat-tricks! Sporting should be very afraid. Should start(obviously).

Post some updates in this thread to let us know how they're doing if you're watching any of their matches today.

I miss Dimitar Berbatov. He was a player with technical sophistication, one whose finishing was aesthetically pleasing as well as efficient. Put simply he was fun to watch, both on television and in person. I miss him dearly and still love to root for him at fulham.

This subreddit gets very active during big games. We get hundreds and hundreds of comments on match threads and numerous posts and links. Today I'm sure, will be no exception.

Whatever the result, whatever controversial event occurs in the match, PLEASE vent your joy/anger in the match or post match thread. We do NOT need 20 self posts screaming 'YEAAAAAAAHHH WE WON' or 'FUCK CITY' or 'FUCK THE REF FOR THAT ONE SHIT CALL HE MADE'.

Moderators will be watching the 'new' feed and removing most of these posts, memes, reaction gifs, etc. They contribute very little to the sub and end up being very 'sore winner' ish threads. Why not focus all your celebrations into the ACTUAL post match thread? That's what it's there for!!! Then everyone can celebrate in one post, instead of spread out over 10 posts.

I'm not asking you to dull down your celebrations or frustration, but merely to channel it into one post.

1376158631.0	1k3lui	[Loan watch] - 10/08/13	fallark	92	12	12	"This is the second installment of ***‘Loan watch’***, a weekly post which focuses on the performances of our loanees.

Every season many Manchester United players go out on loan to various other clubs to gain valuable first-team experience. So far this season, two United youngsters (Reece James and Ryan Tunnicliffe) have been loaned out.
***

**Reece James** – He did not play any part in Carlisle United’s four goal loss away at Bradford this afternoon as he picked up a knock in a [midweek League Cup](http://i.imgur.com/wNrYtWP.png) match against Blackburn. James returned to Old Trafford the very next day for assessment of the thigh injury. The extent of his injury is not clear yet but Carlisle’s physio Neil Dalton told the club’s website that they will soon hear from Man United’s medical department . 
&gt; ""As usual in cases like this we tend to send the player back to their parent club, so he is now with them for a full assessment”

****
**Ryan Tunnicliffe**: **Ipswich Town** 3 - 0. Milwall – Tunnicliffe did not play the League Cup match against Stevenage midweek because he has apparently not been granted permission by United to play in Cup matches. But Ryan made his debut for Ipswich today when he came off the bench after 63 minutes. Ryan reportedly did quite well (one journalist described him as ""looking like a bundle of energy."") on his debut today and even had a couple of chances of scoring, including a one-on-one with the Milwall keeper who made a smart save to deny Tunni. 

 Ryan said this on Twitter after the game 
&gt;Great win today! First 3 points of the season! Fans were great again! Can't believe I didn't open my goal scoring account! Roll on next week

**Post match comments**:

***
**Robin van Persie**:

* 'I'm very happy its weird you know, I had to wait so long for the first title. It's fantastic, it's a championship for everyone at the club. Its a 20th title and well deserved.'

* On the 2nd goal: 'One of the best, but today it didn't matter. It was a great ball from Wayne, incredible. I needed a bit of luck but it's great.'

[Video of RVP interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBCTK0xcb1M)
***
**Wayne Rooney**:

* 'When you lose the title the way we did it wasn't a nice feeling, we've dug deep and worked together and tonight we've finished the job. This title is only going to help the young players in the squad. It's been a great season for me, you want to win trophies and we have done that.'

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_7Py83LNjQ)
***
**Sir Alex Ferguson**:

* ""We've deserved it: our consistency has won us the league,""

* on Jones: ""The way Jones is going, he could be our best ever player.""

* on RVP's second goal: ""Goal of the Season? [Goal] of the Century for me.""

* on criticism this MUFC team weaker than predecessors: ""Nostalgia plays tricks on you ... 'When I was a boy things weren't the same'""

* On Van Persie: ""He had a dry spell, as most strikers do, but he has come back from that &amp; he was unbelievable tonight.""

* ""Ryan Giggs, deary me, he is a freak, a unique freak.A  phenomenal man. We're lucky to have him &amp; Paul Scholes.""

[Video of SAF's interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PVtO-9OOws)
****
**Ryan Giggs**:

* ""To win it back is something special. We put on a show &amp; did it in style. The youngsters have learned from last year.""

* ""Everything comes from the manager. He's an unbelievable manager and an unbelievable person and he deserves everything he gets.""

***
15:45 There's plenty of chatter and hubbub here as you would expect, with a variety of different languages being used to illustrate the global presence in the room.

***
15:38 Just over 20 minutes to go before the scheduled start of the big event. The seats are in place behind the desk as you can see from our first picture from inside the Europa Suite. Remember Nemanja Vidic is due to accompany his new manager.
***
15:46 The photographers have been given the all-clear to head through and take their shots of the new manager. Expect to see them on ManUtd.com in due course as our very own John Peters is part of the group. 
***
MUTV with an interesting timing for Ad break.
***
15:50 We're only minutes away from hearing from the new manager of Manchester United. It will be fascinating to hear David Moyes' thoughts on a variety of topics that are sure to be addressed.
***
15:58 About to get underway inside Old Trafford as David Moyes makes his way into the room. We'll provide live updates here and look out for the stories on the site in due course and also full video of the press conference, courtesy of MUTV, later in the day.

***
16:00 Phil Townsend introduces David and skipper Nemanja Vidic to the floor. ""I'm incredibly privileged,"" admits the boss. ""I had no idea whatsoever. I knew nothing at all about it until Sir Alex gave me a call."" The pair met at Sir Alex's house and was told you're the next Manchester United manager by his fellow Scot.
***
**from twitter**: Moyes says he has talked to Rooney. ""Wayne's not for sale. He's a Man United player and will remain a Man United player.""
***
16:01 ""Old Trafford is the place you want to go,"" adds Moyes, who feels it is a plus for British coaches that he has been handed this fabulous opportunity. He admits to some trepidation at stepping into Sir Alex's shoes as he has so much respect for the man he has replaced.

***
16:02 David Moyes has met Sir Bobby Charlton, which was a ""thrill"" and has spoken to Wayne Rooney about overtaking the legend's goalscoring record. ""He's not for sale and will remain a Manchester United player."" The striker is training 'brilliantly well' and will target the all-time goals record.

***
Moyes dodging questions about Rooney wanting to leave, but comitted he is not for sale.
***
16:04 David is looking forward to working with Wayne again, as he did at Everton, and getting the best out of him as the journalists pepper the new manager with questions about the striker. ""Wayne won't be sold by Manchester United,"" he reiterates. 

***
16:06 The new boss hopes Sir Alex does sit in the directors' box as he won't be intimidated by his presence. There are thanks due also to Rene Meulensteen, who was asked to stay but felt it fair on the Scot to leave, and Mike Phelan. ""Sir Alex is not there to pressure me,"" stresses Moyes. ""The players have also responded well.""
***
16:08 ""I come to a club where success is tattooed across its badge,"" states the boss, who says he has gained great confidence from being told he would be the club's manager by Sir Alex. ""We'll do everything we can to add to the squad,"" he says. 

***
16:10 David says it's not his style to speak about players who are contracted to other clubs after being asked directly about any interest in Cristiano Ronaldo. ""This club is always interested in the best players,"" he reiterates.

***
16:11 Paul Scholes is taking some time off to spend with his family. Ryan Giggs is described as an ""incredible footballer"" and the new man wants some young members of staff behind him.

***
16:13 ""I've never seen United get a tougher Premier League start over the years,"" jokes the manager. He hopes to get balance right between winning and entertaining. ""I hope I have the same magic touch as Sir Alex,"" he asserts. It is made clear that not all of the squad is back in training.

***
16:15 Ashley Young, Chris Smalling and Nani (who has had an operation on his nose) are doubts for the tour. They will be assessed at the start of next week before the flight out. Wilfried Zaha is due out in on Monday. Shinji Kagawa will meet up with the squad in Japan but Javier Hernandez has more time off.

***
16:17 David thinks he has been left a squad capable of retaining the Barclays Premier League and was pleased to be handed a six-year contract. The boss believes managers are sacked too quickly these days and feels fortunate to have worked at Preston and Everton where that hasn't been the case.
***
16:20 Sir Alex will be used for advice and David concedes it will probably be impossible for a manager to reign for 25 years at this level again. On transfers, he admits: ""It does change as we used to shop in a different window at Everton. This club will always look to buy the best young players and a big part of my job is to bring young players through the Academy. We're looking to bring through our own players.""
***
16:23 The boss stresses the club needs to do well in all the competition it enters. ""There's a tradition of being used to winning trophies."" Nemanja Vidic says Wayne Rooney is in the best physical shape for the past five years and he hasn't spoken to him about his future.

***
16:24 David spent an hour or two on the phone with Paul Scholes. ""There will be a place for him and we'll look to bring him back in.""

***
16:25 ""I'll try but time is closing in,"" David Moyes replies when asked about transfers and the prospect of having a new player in before the tour.  

***
16:25 That's the end of the press conference. Thanks for joining us.

1374066152.0	1ihe8s	I completely understand why Rooney is unhappy at United	geo_crampy	110	34	87	"I know this will be unpopular with a lot of people, but I feel like I have to voice my opinion.

Wayne Rooney has been an outstanding player since the time he has joined us. Year after year, he has been among the top goalscorers in the Prem, as well as one of the leaders in assists. He has scored important goals for United, spectacular goals for United, and despite patches of poor form, as well as being played absolutely anywhere, he has given 100% in every match he has played for the team.

Despite this, he has been called fat, unfit, and a baby by United fans for years. All this because we picked up a new star striker? So we don't need him anymore?

Fergie came out and said after the last match of the season that he asked for a transfer, but none of us were part of that discussion. What we do know is that no official request was handed out, and that rather than make a media circus, Wayne has kept his head down, and kept his council. If you don't know what happened in the room between Fergie and Rooney, why speculate and throw someone who has given 100% under the bus?

As far as I see it, United fans are pushing Rooney out the door. No wonder he's unhappy! What could Rooney have done differently? He has apologized unreservedly for the transfer request in 2010, and gone on to play some brilliant games since then. He has played whenever called on, and shown periods of being as good as he can be (when RVP was misfiring).

If we want Wayne Rooney to stay at Manchester United, then we need to support the team, and support the player. I truly believe that Wayne Rooney wants to stay at United, but he has no way of winning the fans over.

So I ask you, what would you do if you're a player who has proven that on most teams you would be the number one star, but at your current club are played out of position, or not at all, and feel like you're often ridiculed and under appreciated by your own fans?"	t5_2rxse	True

**Team news:**

* The future of Wayne Rooney remains uncertain. David Moyes has proclaimed the player as 'not for sale' despite growing speculation that he wants out of Old Trafford. He was withdrawn from United's pre season tour with a suspiciously timed hamstring injury that is all but certain to keep him out of the Community Shield.
* Wilfried Zaha could make his competitive debut in Manchester United colours having been given a fair amount of game time in friendlies and impressing.
* With no other new signings for David Moyes' new side, it could be a familiar looking United team lining up.
* Owen Coyle's side faces a wholly different proposition this week to the one they were up against last week. After beating Barnsley 4-0 on the opening day of the Championship they come up against Premier League champions Manchester United at Wembley.
* New signing Thomas Rogne's back injury kept him out of the game at Oakwell and could rule him out of this match too.
* Coyle will probably field a 5 man midfield again and continue with 4 at the back rather than the 3 Wigan played with last season.


**Match facts:**

* Premier League champions Manchester United play FA Cup winners Wigan Athletic in the Community Shield at Wembley, with the majority expecting nothing more than an extremely one sided affair.
* Relegated Wigan beat United's rivals City here back in May, but whilst back then the Cup gave them welcome respite from their battle against the drop, it is now little more than an extra game in what will be a long and tiring season in which they will be hoping to make an immediate return to the top flight.
* David Moyes has had a tough summer already, with fans questioning his inability to attract big names to the club. Anything but a convincing win will be seen as something of a disappointment, so United will go all out to kill this game off early on. A second giant-killing victory at Wembley over a Manchester side in 2013 is almost out of the question.

1374593015.0	1ivzvq	Help me create the Manchester United squad animation	Swederman	73	7	11	"Greatings!

Yesterday [I posted an animation of the evolution of Chelsea's squad during the Roman era](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1itipp/evolution_of_the_chelsea_squad_during_the/). I was thrilled by the reception and decided to do another one. 

I chose ManU because I already had the 11-12 kit in my computer (did it for a request at that time) and because it would be cool to compare the United stability with the Chelsea...unstabiility. 

However given how time-consuming it is, outside help (with inside knowledge of United) would be greatly appreciated. I need two things from you guys to make it happen:

~~-**Pictures of the back of each united main goalkeeper kit from 2003 to 2014**. Multiple angles if necessary, and at least one with a printed number so I can know what color to use.~~

~~- [**Fill this spreadsheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Au--AZNC6cMDdGxfU2RGbDZBYjlBY3pPX1N4eW15Rnc&amp;hl=en#gid=0). It takes quite a bit of time but it would make my job about 500 times easier and faster. You can edit the online document.~~

You can look at the example to understand how it must be filled, but it's pretty simple: the color in the cell correspond to what will be outlined in the animation. If a player has two events in one cell (like Van Aanholt in the example) put the first event as the backround color and the second event as the writing color) 

 Put the name used on the kit (like Chicharito for Javier Hernandez), and only list players who played after the September/February 1st of each season. (For instance if a guy left in August 30, the red cell must be on the previous season. If he didn't play the season before, don't put him)

[Here's a sample](http://imgur.com/a/EXthC)



Feel free to ask/PM if you have any question or suggestion. 

I hope we can make this happen!

PS: As a Chelsea fan it was painful to put Champions' badges over and over agian :/

We both enjoy writing the posts, but they take hours. If you guys dont like them, there is no point in doing it again. Well, thats my thought process anyway.


Bonus question: If yes, what would you like to see?

Overwhelming response..The amount of positive, encouraging posts flatter us!

I am posting previews for this coming season's Premier League on /r/soccer. Just writing a few words and trying to learn about each team a day at a time. Yesterday was [Chelsea](http://redd.it/1kd1pa), today is Manchester City, tomorrow is Manchester United.

If you are able to help, here is how: I put views of what the fans of the team think of the current situation, which players they like, what formation the team may play etc. in the preview.
If you leave your comment here I will attempt include it in the preview and link to this thread and the sub.

The other thing that would help is any information you think people who aren't Manchester United fans might not know about the club? Let me know.

Plus, you are very welcome to come and contribute to the discussion, I will post it on /r/soccer around 7pm tomorrow. Cheers guys.

From now on; unless what you post is an article with a LEGIT transfer rumour/confirmation, ie, **""Ferguson admits he will try to sign Lewandowski in the summer""**, with quotes, from a reliable source, then your post will be removed. It's not ideal for us to have to clamp down on OC from you guys, but all posts contain basically the same names. It's boring an repetitive, and most of it has been built on bullshit journalism. 

Sorry if this is a pain, as I know you guys like talking about possible targets, but it's pretty pointless at the moment. We will have to come up with a system once the season ends to properly manage all the rumours for the summer.

**Match Updates**

0' Kick Off-Lets hope that we see a good performance !

1' An early show of Zaha's skils as he does a couple step overs and takes on a player, very silky.

4' United Corner-short to zaha, who passes to giggs, crosses it in and results in another corner.

5' Clevs plays the ball in, Jones with the head but a relatively easy save for the Keeper.

6' Lingard plays Welbeck in, who takes a decent shot but keeper saves, from the resulting corner Evra heads it but its wide.

10' **Goal** Lingard 1 on 1 and he slots it in with ease **United first goal of the Moyes era.** ALXI 0-1 UTD

13' Corner United-  goes in and straight back out for a corner.

14' Corner United, and out for a GK

15' Corner United-Evra heads only just over the bar, could of been 2-0

22' Another piece of skill by zaha, who takes on his man, but his cross reaches no one, I could see zaha getting a lot more play time than I first thought this season.

26' first decent chance for the A-league, but a decent low save for lindegaard keeps it out, the resulting corner ends up with a united fk.

33' **GOAL** Welbeck completes great passing play with a cool finish, Great for him to get a goal ALXI 0-2 UTD

39' CLOSE, Welbeck rounds the keeper, but his shot is blocked, could of done better, but wasnt really his fault, a very good block.

42' zaha plays the ball in, out for a corner

43' Corner United- great play leaves welbeck in but a bad angle, keeper saves but it almost goes in, welbeck looks fired up.

45' **HALF TIME** ALXI 0-2 UTD Great play by united especially Welbeck, but would like to see januzaj and RVP on for Giggs and Welbs(nothing to do with his performace, would just like to see Van Persie)

45' **SUB** Michael Keane on for Ferdi

45' Game restarts for the second half.

49' Corner in is headed by Keane, but goes over

52' **GOAL** All stars scored ALXI 1-2 UTD

54' **(WHAT A) GOAL** Lingard cuts in a curls it into the top right corner ALXI 1-3 UTD

56' Should of been a pen to United ? resulting corner lands to lingard, but his shot is saved.

61' Here he comes, ROBIN VAN PERSIE, on for giggs.

68' Welbeck beats the keeper again, this time his shot was on target, just blocked though.

69' **GOAL** From the resulting corner, Welbeck head it in, tell you what, he plays like this all season he'll become a starter, maybe we all judged him too soon?

70' Welbeck off for Januzaj, Anderson on for Carrick (Thanks /u/daerep)

74' close by Zaha

82' game has calmed down a bit

86' **HE SCORES WHEN HE WANTS** Van persie makes it 5. ALXI 1-5 UTD

90' Januzaj hits the post, so annoying, been a great game but would of love to see him and zaha score.

90' **Full Time** A-League All Star XI 1-5 Manchester united (Welbeck 2, Lingard 2, RVP 1)

1372812440.0	1hjakr	Some of the United jokes posted in a r/soccer thread	VictoriousPR	77	15	10	"United have signed a new centre forward from Kabul United FC. Apparently on his first day at training, Ferguson picked up a ball and said: ""Ball."" Then he pointed at the goal and said: ""Goal."" Then he demonstrated a kicking motion and said: ""Kick. Understand? Kick, ball, goal. GOOOOOOAAAAALLLLLL!"" The Afghan striker was a little puzzled by this and summed up the courage to say ""Excuse me, Mr. Ferguson, but I speak very good English."" To which Ferguson replies: ""Sit down, son. I'm talking to Wayne.""


________________________________________________________________________________________



Sir Alex Ferguson is curious how Arsène Wenger's team went on such a magnificent unbeaten run, so he decides on a visit to Arsenal's training ground to see how Wenger trains his players. After one day he is not really impressed by the training practices, so he asks Wenger how he gets his players so sharp. ""Well, it is simple. I sometimes ask my players a difficult question, and that way they stay really sharp mentally"". Of course Fergie wants an example, so Wenger asks Thierry Henry to come over. He asks: ""Henry, he is not your brother, but still he is your father’s son. Who is he?"" ""That is not difficult,"" Henry answers immediately, ""Of course that is me."" ""You see? That’s the way you keep them sharp,"" Wenger says to Ferguson. Fergie, who wants to be the next ""Invincibles"", decides to bring this into his training the next day. He calls Ruud van Nistlerooy over. ""Ruud, I have a question for you,"" he says, ""He is not your brother, but still he is your father’s son, who is he?"" ""My God, Ferguson,"" is van Nistlerooy's reply, ""That is a tough one to answer, can I sleep on that for one night?"" Ferguson agrees with the one-night postponement. So that night RvN decides to call Jaap Stam. He has been at Manchester United, so maybe he knows something about these questions. ""Jaap Stam, maybe you know the answer to this question: he is not your brother, but still he is your father’s son. Who is he?"" ""That is easy, that is me!"" says Stam. So the next day RvN walks full of confidence to Fergie. Fergie asks: ""Ruud, do you know the answer to my question now?"" ""Yes it was actually very easy,"" he says, ""Is it Jaap Stam?"" Ferguson answers, ""No of course not you stupid b*****d. It’s Thierry Henry.""

89' - No clue how much stoppage time we have. 

89' - Fulham still attacking. And we have 2 minutes of stoppage time.

90' - Fulham still trying to make their way into the United box. Riether with the cross but safe into the hands of De Gea.

90' - Valencia running and then pass to Hernandez. Scholes with a pass to Kagawa. Rafael with the ball. 

91' - Saw a Scholes tackle. No yellow card. This is very interesting. United clear the ball now attacking.

91' - Nani with the ball on the left. Nani shoots but off target.

92' - Schwarzer with the goal kick. The whistle has been blown.

Across all games, he was won more aerial duels than he has lost. 

He has scored 2 goals in 4 PL appearances as a fullback, one a weak-footed finesse and the other off an aerial duel.

In 3 out of 4 PL games, he has been the most influential player on the pitch for United, which means he had the most touches of any of our players on the pitch.

He has over 5 take-ons and has not lost a single one. 

He has one Man of the Match in a fullback position.

Rafael's development is amazing. Already, he looks much more responsible than in previous years and the Brazilian in him is starting to show through his dribbling skills. His runs into the box have been very controlled and he is making better decisions with the ball at his feet.

**Tottenham 2-1 Newcastle**

Gareth Bale puts in another great performance for Spurs to give them the win, and he honestly could of scored 4 if it was not for Tim Krul and a real bad miss, newcastle arguably played better but much like RVP for united, Bale can turn a game on it's head at any point, which he did today. A lot injuries in this game which resulted in 9 mins added on in the end.

---
**Chelsea 4-1 Wigan**

Angelo Henriquez did not get any game time today as wigan were brushed aside by Chelsea. Lampard scored again which Im sure has now cemented the opportunity of him getting a new contract, would not have minded him coming as a free to United.

---
**Norwich 0-0 Fulham**

One of the more boring games in the league today, Becchio had the best chance for norwhich after 5 minutes, but shot straight at the keeper, Berba was not really involved today.

---
**Stoke 2-1 Reading**

Stoke hold off another late reading surge, very reminiscent of United's late goals earlier on in the season to win 2-1, reading had a late penalty appeal turned down, but credit to stoke, as they really controlled the game for most of the match.

---
**Sunderland 0-1 Arsenal**

A Santi Carzola goal gives Arsenal the win and 5th position, Carl Jenkinson was sent off  and Fletcher and Bramble both missed chances, Walcott hit the post and Wilshed went off due to injury.

---
**Swansea 4-1 QPR**

Another dismal display by QPR meant Swansea picked up the 3 points, Michu continuing his fine goal form by scoring 2, with Rangel and Hernandez getting the other 2, Bobby Zamora scored a Consolation goal for the visitors, but a bad defense display by QPR.

---
**Southampton 3-1 Man City**

Are City cracking up ? 

Southampton give United a big helping hand by offering the reds the chance of going 12 points clear at the top, Puncheon and Davies Scored before Dzeko pulled one back for City, then an amazing Gareth Barry own goal secured the Southampton victory, if United can beat Everton tomorrow then we can build the gap up  to 12 points.

I am not suggesting they post them all here instead of as their own individual post, but to do it as well as creating those individual threads. Thus to allow people to have one place for their viewing pleasure :)

Please keep top comments that aren't any of the above to a minimum, but feel free to comment on those media that have been posted as much as you want obviously!

(feel free to say if you'd rather not)

1357590656.0	164ztw	Regarding non-United related submissions. 	D1794	74	10	54	"If you frequent in this subreddit you will have noticed a rise in submissions. This is no doubt due to the sharp rise of the amount of subscribers here in /r/reddevils. We're very pleased about that and would only encourage further growth.

However, there has also been a rise in posts about things that have **absolutely nothing to do with Manchester United Football 
Club.**

The sidebar reads ""The subreddit for all things United"". Not the subreddit for United and everything bad about our rivals. 

Whilst I agree that a huge part of football is the rivalry, the banter between opposing fans, these kind of pictures and articles do not belong in this subreddit. It is a place for Manchester United news and discussion. It fuels a negative response, and puts us as a community in a bad light. It just comes off as immature and makes us seem like we have a severe disinterest in our own club when on our top posts there is an article about Mario Balotelli or Luis Suarez. 

I'm not saying that 100% of everything that is posted here has to be about United, on the contrary, one of my favourite posts in this subreddit is the GIF of the Liverpool fans getting soaked by a sprinkler. There is a line between banter with your rivals and actually caring about the ongoings of their club. It has led me to suggest we operate under the rule: 

**If it could be posted in the subreddit of the rival club, it should not be posted here.**

For example, the bust up between Balotelli and Mancini should have been left to /r/mcfc, yet it was posted here TWICE. There is no place for it here. If you want to discuss a MAN CITY matter, please go to /r/mcfc or /r/soccer where the articles will be posted. I don't want to sound like I'm controlling what you can and cannot say within this subreddit, i'm easygoing, but the fact Luis Suarez didn't want to sign something for a kid at LIVERPOOL'S fa cup game, should not be posted here. I believe I speak for a number of subscribers when I say this.

Cheers for reading. 

EDIT: I hope I didn't give the impression that all rivalry banter should be stopped in this subreddit."	t5_2rxse	True
