1373608256.0	1i4xsi	A PSA from an LAPD Officer		712	116	343	"Hi folks. I've been seeing something a lot lately that concerns me, and I wanted to point something out.

When we stop someone, either in a car or on foot, who's considered armed and dangerous, we have our guns out for obvious reasons. We deploy in such a way that all of our guns are pointed in one direction (towards the bad guy) so that if he does something that warrants the use of deadly force, we don't shoot each other in what's commonly referred to as a ""crossfire"" situation.

Here's what bothers me. Whenever we do this, people want to watch. And that's a perfectly natural thing. But the thing is, we've got our guns out for a reason, and that is that we have reason to believe that this person might either point a gun at us or actually shoot us. We do these stops all the time and 99% of them don't end in gunfire. But on certain rare occasions they do. And guess what? All of those people out on the street gawking and/or taking pictures and videos are in the line of fire. 

People, the guns are real. The bullets are real. If you see guns out, GET THE HELL OUT OF THE WAY.

I'm writing this because today we arrested a really bad guy for some pretty heinous crimes, and when we took him into custody, we had no fewer than 5 guns pointed at him. And what did I see down the street? A mother, daughter, and son all just standing there, pointing, completely in the line of fire and completely oblivious to the fact that had shots been fired, they would have been in the crossfire. 

I'm not saying this because I don't want people recording me. I don't care if I get recorded. In this day and age, most of us just assume that whatever we do is going to be on youtube in 20 minutes. I'm saying this because I care about people, and I don't want someone to get hit with either my bullet or a bad guy's bullet if the situation deteriorates and I or one of my partners ends up having to use our guns.

TL;DR - if you see a cop with his or her gun out, it's probably a good idea to find another place to be."	t5_2qht0	True

I was recently prescribed doxacilin, an antibiotic, for acne. I was told to take it on an empty stomach. I tried doing that at first and it gave me horrible stomach aches. I usually take it with food now, which helps, but this morning I took it by itself and skipped lunch. I started doing some errands when I started sweating a lot in my car. I figured it was just because it was 82 degrees out and the air conditioning in my car wasn't working. Driving down the 405 I started getting lightheaded, so I pulled off an exit near LAX and got out of my car. I puked on the side of the road about four times, and the fourth time a cop car saw me and stopped over. They obviously thought I was hungover. I explained my situation and told them I needed food in my stomach. They let me leave my car there (I was in no condition to drive) and went and drove me to Burger King, even paid for my meal. I felt better after the meal, they drove me back to my car, and that was it. These cops made my day. So yes, maybe a lot of the LAPD are jerks, but some are good people. "	t5_2qht0	True

1364248138.0	1b00nz	18 y/o Boy Brain-dead, HIT &amp; RUN while cycling this morning at OXNARD &amp; BEL AIR (Valley)	TinyMontgomerySaysHi	477	48	67	"My neighbor David was riding his bicycle yesterday evening when somebody driving a dark vehicle sped through a red light at Oxnard at Bellaire* at about 5:30pm. He is now brain dead and on life support*. His family is devastated, the neighborhood shaken, and I am sickened. There would be definite damage to the vehicle as his body was thrown more than 100 feet. There was a blurry photo captured by a nearby security camera which I will post if I can get a hold of it. If you know anything please [contact the LAPD](http://www.lapdonline.org/report_a_crime), spread the word, and be careful out there.

EDIT: Street is Bellaire

EDIT: I'm hearing it was a black SUV-type without plates, male driver with shaved head. All secondhand, not 'official.'

EDIT: Corrected the time to PM yesterday. Apologies--lots of word of mouth info coming second hand today.

EDIT: Additional source and more info [here](http://bikinginla.wordpress.com/2013/03/26/breaking-news-18-year-old-cyclist-critically-injured-in-valley-glen-hit-and-run/). Source says: ""Various witnesses described the vehicle as a Silver 2000-02 Mecerdes ML SUV. The driver was described as an overweight white or Armenian male in his 50s, with either gray hair or bald head.""

EDIT: David passed away this evening surrounded by his family and his friends.

I wanted to let you know that the other driver and I are OK- we even hugged it out on the shoulder in front of the CHP and the tow truck driver even made me a cup of coffee at his office while I was waiting for someone to pick me up. Please slow down, use your signal, and check your blind spot. Far too often people aren't as fortunate as I am and aren't able to walk away from what is now a total loss vehicle.

It's not that hard to flick on your blinker when changing lanes or trying to navigate through traffic. I've lived in a few cities throughout my life (Boston, Reno, Auckland, Miami) and nowhere is this problem as bad as it is in LA.

It's just a tad scary on the freeways down here when people are changing lanes at will with no signal.  Especially bad at stop signs and in residential neighborhoods. 

I would love to see billboards reminding people to use their blinkers. It would make life easier for everyone - pedestrians included. It would speed up the flow of traffic by letting people anticipate their next move and obviously make things a bit safer for everyone. 

If you don't use it, for the love of god, it's so simple. I even do it in residential areas at night when there are no other cars around. I'm surprised more tickets aren't given out for this."	t5_2qht0	True

THIS CAN BE ANYWHERE, the valley, Long beach, seriously within a 25 mile radius of los angeles proper would be good.... Last year's party was in santa clarita!!

We can plan it all, we just need a venue.

How about 100 people? If it gets close enough to halloween not that many people will know about it, a 100 person reddit party would still be awesome....

Edit: SELF POST. I GET NO KARMA. UPVOTE IF YOU WANT AN AWESOME HALLOWEEN PARTY!

Edit 2: about concerns of loss or theft: See angouleme's reply below. He hosted last years halloween party (~200people) and nothing was lost or stolen and we had nobody to keep and eye on things, this year we have a core of regular r/la'ers that will keep a watchful eye on things. 

Edit 3: Here are pictures from last year (must me a member of the los angeles reddit meetup page to see them, but its worth signing up just to see these pics).

1371687759.0	1gozw0	trying to find the people who saved my life	mathe106	347	38	70	"I am the 23-year-old female who was in a horrific motorcycle accident at the intersection of Olympic &amp; Barrington, just east of Santa Monica, on the morning of October 6, 2011.

I'm looking for the people who helped save my life.

I remember everything from the accident, including the pain and the fear. I thought I was going to die in the middle of street when I was only a few blocks from safely arriving to work. If not death, I thought a lifetime in a wheelchair awaited me.

But when I was panicking and wondering if I should tell one of the people who rushed from their cars to help me to tell my family that I loved them, angels came to my side. Not the ""near death delusion"" kind, but real people who stayed by my side and told me I'd be OK even though I was scared and cold and terrified of dying. Though these people didn't know yet, bones were protruding from my body underneath my clothes. I had dozens of fractures. I was bleeding. But they promised I'd be OK and told me to hang on.

I did hang on through months of surgeries and physical therapy and pain. And now I'm walking and happy and healthy and, unless you spot my few subtle scars, you'd never know about that day.

But the one thing I never got to do was say thank you. Thank you, angels, for saving my life. For not letting me let go. This is my last ditch effort to find them, but I just want them to know that I'm grateful for them every day I'm alive.

The images are all like 300 x 300 px but look as if they are being stretched from 200 x 200. Like property managers even know how to scale their own images. Also their search functions give different results whether you do map or list type - gotta do both to make sure you get all the listings. And the general lay-out, oh man, worst UI ever.



Second, their mobile app has 1 star it is so bad. Nothing more to say here.



My gf and I paid $70 for 60 days of this. We had an easier time just walking around the neighborhoods and calling property managers.



But the question is - I run a web dev / marketing company and we have the resources to build out something like WSR but obviously better, and probably free.



But I'm wondering what gives WSR the stronghold it has on the market while offering the worst product. And it seems that there are even a lot of property managers who don't even bother to list on WSR, even though it is free to them. Why?"	t5_2qht0	True

It sounded like a lost tourist so I said ""Yeah, what's up do you need directions?"" He pulled over and came out of his car. 

He was super friendly and said he was an Italian designer. He said he was at a fashion event in Beverly Hills and he was about to catch a plane back to Italy. He said he had designer clothes he wanted to give away for free because he didn't want to pay taxes for it to customs. Anyway he walked to his car and showed me like 3 ""Armani"" jackets. He offered them for free and emphasized that they were really expensive. I thought ""hmm I'm either really lucky or it's some scam."" He wasn't asking for money so I thought I might be lucky. 

Finally at the end he said he was giving me all these for free (worth thousand of $$ supposedly ) but if I could help him with his car rental. He showed me the car rental bill and it was thousands of dollars. He showed me an italian passport to to seem legit. Anyway, as soon as money was mentioned I said no thanks and peaced out. He was very convincing though. I googled it and it's a scam. It's happening in L.A so a shout out yall don't lose money. Peace.

1352142602.0	12ojfq	Please vote NO on measure B, here's why:	igolightly	348	66	183	"DHello all!  I work in the adult industry.  I co-own a distribution company, do post-production for adult movies, and my husband is a director and producer.  Passage of this measure could be devastating for the industry.  While this is a seemingly well intentioned it really doesn't help any of the people it's trying to help.  


The adult industry is small and tries it's best to be self policing.  Performers are offered condoms on every set and they are mostly declined.  One of the major reasons is that performers take STI and HIV tests every 28 days (increasingly every 14 days) and are required to present the results on set.  The producers then also confirm the results in a database restricted to production management.  Another reason is that it's simply uncomfortable to have sex for up to 3 hours on and off under hot lights with condoms.  It's a bit unreasonable to have performers wear condoms, but not have MMA figthers wear full body protective suits to protect them from blood and sweat.


The economic impact will be huge for the industry and will cost taxpayer dollars too.  Someone's gotta go check and make sure everyone's willys are wrapped up tight right?  The cost of getting a film permit for adult will go up a lot.  Porn's not making a lot of money these days so people might opt to not pull a permit.  That means less money for the LA film office.  However the consequence of not pulling a permit and getting caught making an adult film will now be a felony!  Many producers won't want to take that risk and will move their productions out of state.  Performers will not get work, sound stages will have less clients, and film crews will lose work.  It will drive the industry away from LA.



The porn business seems pretty shady and scummy from the outside.  It's no shadier or scummier than anything else.  We pay our taxes, we have families, we organize charity events, we want our communities to thrive. This is on the ballot because people want to exert some sort of moral control on our industry, not because they care for the health and safety of it's performers.




Please vote no on measure B.

LittleRedRidingHoody	317	64	95	"[Original](http://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/zi490/if_anyone_in_north_hollywood_is_missing_a_drunk/)
 
Drunk girl is now what I hope safe back at her friends apartment. Here is what happened-

When I found her crying I told her my name, asked if she was okay, needed any medical/police attention. She said no. I asked her if there was anyone I could call for her because she didn't have a purse or phone and she told me that she didn't remember any phone numbers. I recommended calling her cell phone to see if her friends would answer it, but it was turned off.

She didn't appear too drunk, just more scared (I would be too) so I let her come up to my place and gave her some water and tissues. I tried to get her story but she really wasn't in any state to discuss it or something. So I leave her on the couch and go to my room to make some phone calls.

I first call my only friend in LA (just moved here about two months ago) and he was drunk so not much help. So I called the NON emergency police number. Big fucking help that was. The operator told me this wasn't an emergency (no shit, I called the NON emergency) and that she couldn't help me. So now what?

I go to check on her again and she is still sobbing and my dogs are trying to lick her face off so I asked her again if she remembered where she was staying. She remembered! I looked it up and it was only 4mins away, seeing as how she had no money for a cab and I certainly don't I offered to take her. 

I brought my dogs in the car with me (I didn't know what I was about to get into) and drove very slowly down the street until she remembered the building. But the building was locked and we couldn't get in. So we went back to my car and told her it would be okay, if I can call her mom (didn't remember that number either) but then someone came out of the building and I asked them to let her in. 

She went inside and about 10mins later she came out and gave me the thumbs up. I went home. I guess it worked out okay.


Here's what my reason for doing it was- I would want someone to do it for me if I was in that situation and not worried if I would be taken advantage of, lost forever, arrested, whatever. I didn't let her in my room or see my stuff just in case this was some shitty robbery set up. I asked her about facebook, but she couldn't remember her name or password on it.

1333556128.0	rt22z	Beverly Hills organizing against the subway tunnel under BH High School.  If you care at all about having a station in the heart of Century City, read on.	WhenDookieCalls	285	38	213	"If you haven't been following the situation so far, here's where we're at:

After 30 years in planning, Metro is now close to breaking ground on the Purple line extension, which will extend the line from its current terminus at Wilshire/Western to Westwood/VA Hospital, with many stops along Wilshire.

Metro originally had 2 candidate stop locations for Century City- one in the heart of CC at Constellation Blvd and Ave of the Stars, and another possible location along Santa Monica Blvd.

Beverly Hills Unified School District (BHUSD) strongly preferred the Santa Monica Blvd stop, because the Constellation Blvd stop means that the line would have to go under Beverly Hills High School.

Last month, Metro released the draft environmental impact report for the subway extension, and announced their preference for the Constellation Blvd station. BHUSD immediately accused Metro of ""bait-and-switch"" tactics, even though both station locations were clearly marked as options in all previous materials. The reasons for Metro's choice:

   - Ridership would be much higher at Constellation Blvd, since its in the heart of CC, and closer to Fox Studios.  The Santa Monica Blvd location would have put the station next to a golf course, reducing ridership.

  - There is an earthquake fault that runs along Santa Monica Blvd.  Putting the station there would mean running the tunnel on top of the fault, parallel to it- something the seismologists Metro consulted with advised against.  (The Constellation Blvd station means the line would hit that same fault perpendicularly, apparently the safest way to align subways in earthquake prone areas.)

Its important to remember that subway line poses no danger to Beverly Hills High School. Subway lines already safely go under all kinds of building in Los Angeles, not to mention under major roads like Wilshire Blvd, Vermont Ave, and Hollywood Blvd. The lines are buried at an average depth of 70' below ground, and are dug with modern, pressurized tunnel-boring machines that leave the ground *more* stable after construction, not less.

It's also unclear what BHUSD's reasoning against tunneling under the high school is, short of irrational fear.  The various reasons they've stated over the past year include:

* Tunnel construction would disturb the high school (It wouldn't.)
* Tunnel operation would disturb the high school (It wouldn't.)
* Tunnel would be a terrorist target because there are many jewish students at BH High School (yes they actually said this)
* Ridership would be higher at the Santa Monica Blvd station (next to the golf course)
* The tunnel would prevent the high school's expansion plans.

Of those reasons, only the last one seems legit.  Metro reached out to BHUSD last year, and tried to work with them so that the tunnel would not interfere with whatever their future expansion plans might be (massively deep underground parking I guess?)  BHUSD's answer: No thanks...we don't want the tunnel *at all*.


Now, Metro is about to release the *Final* Environmental Impact Report, and BHUSD is massively organized against the plans.  The school district has hired well-known PR firm Sitrick &amp; Company at $895/hr to spin the issue in their favor, and is seeing some success.  They've created a BS website called **[Century City Subway](http://centurycitysubway.org/)** that makes it appear like Century City stakeholders are behind the Santa Monica Blvd. station (They're not.) They encourage BH High School parentsto attend and disrupt Metro's project meetings, creating protest signs for them and even busing them in.  And on articles covering the issue such as the series on **[Beverly Hills Patch](http://beverlyhills.patch.com/articles/metro-hosts-open-house-but-bhhs-subway-tunnel-opponents-shout-you-re-not-hom)**, they counter any comments in favor of the Constellation Station with specious arguments.  They're attempting to influence local and state politicians to join them in their fight against the tunnel. They've even hired their own seismologists to do their own study showing that its unsafe to put the tunnel under BH High School.  Now it appears that their efforts have paid off, and that the Constellation station is in jeopardy.

The fact is, we're dealing with a vocal minority of NIMBYs. The vast majority of LA residents - and even Beverly Hills residents would prefer a station in the heart of Century City, not a quarter mile away.  The vast majority of residents have ridden subways, either here in LA or in one of hundreds of other cities that have them, and understand that line buried 70' underground poses no threat or inconvienence to the buildings above it. 

Metro has had to deal with NIMBYs and lawsuits on past projects, but the difference here is that the NIMBYs are extremely well funded and politically connected.  BHUSD has already reportedly spent $500k on PR for this issue. (I'm not sure why BH High School parents aren't up in arms over that figure...just think about the school supplies and teachers salaries that could be paid for with that amount.) At a subway extension meeting last week, BHUSD organized a protest to **[disrupt the meeting](http://la.curbed.com/archives/2012/04/rancor_rules_the_day_at_purple_line_open_house_in_bev_hills.php)**.

Metro has a board meeting coming up on Thursday April 26.  BHUSD is planning on **[busing in residents](http://beverlyhills.patch.com/articles/bhusd-urges-residents-to-lobby-metro-board)** to tell the board they are against the tunnel and the Constellation Blvd station.  If an equal amount of people in favor of the alignment do not also appear at the meeting, its going to complicate the project. **If you care at all about having a station in Century City and not a quarter-mile away, I encourage you to attend and show your support**. Hell, if you never plan to take the subway but you just hate traffic then show your support, as building the station far from Century City will discourage people from using it and encourage them to drive. 

The meeting is at 9:00am which sucks, but just think about the NIMBYs that will be attending by busload.  Work an extra hour the day before or after if you have to.  Do whatever it takes.  If this station gets built in the wrong place, we'll be regeting it for the next 50 years.

More info **[here](http://la.streetsblog.org/2012/04/02/as-metro-wraps-up-public-outreach-on-westside-subway-beverly-hills-readies-for-a-fight/)**.

**TL;DR - A vocal, well-funded minority is pushing for a purple line subway station a quarter-mile away from Century City instead of at the heart of it, and it looks like they might get their way unless *we* do something about it.  Showdown at the next Metro meeting - Thursday April 26th at 9:00am at Metro's Headquarters @ Union Station. Be there if you can, r/LosAngeles!**

**EDIT**: If you can't make the meeting, you can contact Metro one of three different ways and let them know you prefer the Constellation Blvd station:

1. Send mail to David Mieger at Metro, One Gateway Plaza 99-22-5, Los Angeles, CA, 90012.

2. Complete an online comment form at [www.metro.net/westside](http://www.metro.net/westside).

3. Send an email to WestsideExtension@metro.net.

**EDIT 2**: Breaking: The Patch is reporting that the Beverly Hills City Council may [persue legal action](http://beverlyhills.patch.com/articles/consultants-report-to-council-on-subway-routes) to prevent Metro from tunnelling under the school.  I am shocked...*shocked* at this turn of events, I tell you.        /sarcasm

&gt; Thomas White, Beverly Hills Municipal League president, called on the council to *oppose the subway project entirely* via a letter of opposition signed by all council members, City Attorney Larry Wiener and City Manager Jeff Kolin.

&gt; ""I don't know to what extent our withdrawal of consent will be effective, but I believe that it should be exhausted in terms of its possibility to protect the residential community ... and the business community as well,"" said White. ""We should simply say 'no, no, no, you've had your chance and you've blown it.'""

So they are trying to stop one of the biggest public works projects in Los Angeles county history- one that the federal government has already chipped in a couple billion for- because they don't want a tunnel under their school?  Just wow."	t5_2qht0	True

At that moment I notices cars were slowing down behind me and in that instance I realized that my tire blew out. I safely made my way across a few lanes of traffic on the 101 south and made it to the shoulder. Within 5 minutes the Freeway service patrol showed up and helped my change my tire. I talked to the man (Sergio) and he told me that I should make more people aware of this service. I asked him what the charge was and he said it was no charge. Some of the things they offer are Changing flat tires, Jump-starting dead batteries, Refilling radiators and temporarily repairing leaking hoses, Providing a gallon of fuel.  If the FSP cannot get a stranded car running within ten minutes, it will tow the vehicle to a safe location off the freeway. 

I am happy to report that I did not crash, injury or cause an accident. This was definitely avoidable by checking my tires. This is truly a lesson learned. If you take anything way from this is that you learn from my mistake. And trust me, I wont let it happen again.

I did okcupid for a while and had some success but to be honest, I woud really like to meet someone out in the real world, the old fashioned way.

Well I'm not sure why, but I seem to be completely incapable of making any meaningful connections with women in this town to the point that I'm beginning to question my sanity.  I've found meeting people to be much easier in other cities (Chicago, Portland, Boston).

I'm open to the possibility that it's just me, that my techniques are sub-par or maybe I'm not the catch that I think I am, but I'm just wondering if any other men out there are having a similar experience.

He was on the phone with his mother at around 9:30 last night, and was wandering around West Pico St. seeming disoriented. The phone cut off and no one has seen or heard from him since. **He is diabetic and will need insulin immediately.** He's been in and out of hospitals lately, which may contribute to the disorientation.

He's 6'4, 165 lbs, 22 y.o. Tattoos: a street grid of Manhattan and the outline of a Polaroid picture on his arms, IIII on his ring finger, and the HRC = sign on his wrist. Our entire family is on the east coast, so we're reaching out to as many avenues as possible to find him.

I'm sorry if this isn't the right subreddit for this; if someone can point me in a better direction, I would appreciate it.

EDIT: In response to a request for pictures, here is what I could get real quick: http://imgur.com/spQyKmE

And thank you all so much. It's such a comfort to know that people are looking for him.

EDIT III: Thank God, they found him!!! Sean was at a hospital in Santa Monica -- my aunt just got a call. Thank you all so, so much for spreading awareness and posting fliers and everything you all did. Thank the Lord, this story has a very happy ending."	t5_2qht0	True

We left it overnight in an LAX parking lot and it is gone as of this morning! I need your help in locating the vehicle which is likely abandoned, the license plate is AD25954, arizona plates and is a white 17 foot long u-haul. Please help if you're in the area and phone the police should you spot the vehicle.  If you see an abandoned UHaul, please take note of the plates and report it.  There is a picture of a Zebra on the left hand side of the truck.

Any advice on how to recover stolen goods would be appreciated as well. This was a devastating loss if everything was indeed taken. Every single item I own is in that truck.
Thank you!

Note: This was posted in r/Assistance as well and advice was given to post it to this sub.  This has been reported to the LAPD and the rental company. 

Edit: the truck was found this afternoon full of nothing but garbage and empty boxes.  

Edit: I'm back in Canada and am going to be posting a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the individuals responsible.

**Citadel Outlet Mall**
[Citadel]( http://www.citadeloutlets.com/)  Ugh, buyer beware this mall has an impressive list of popular stores and brand names stores.   However store like Tillys, Icing by Claires, Lucky Brand offer 0-10% off the regular store prices. Once I realized they are a mix of regular and discount stores I decided not to waste my time.  It is my understanding Citadel was built as an outlet mall but now is a mix of regular and discount stores. 

**American Apparel Factory Outlet**
[American Apparel] (http://www.americanapparel.net/storelocator/search.html?retailstoreid=242)   Not really a fan of the styles.  Suprised to see neon tights marked down to $10, lost of retro styles, Men and Childrens sections too.  Free Parking, retail shop downstairs, and outlet upstairs.  One cool thing about this site is they have a graphic artist who will print anything you want on your AA item for $10 or $15.  Not sure they will make you a Lakers or other licensed Logo but its really high tech printing not like iron on transfer.  

**JBrand Jeans**
[JBrand Jeans Outlet] (http://jbrandfactoryoutlet.com/)  Thanks to the outlet I dont own any other jeans.

**The Cooper Building**
[The Cooper Building] (http://cooperdesignspace.blogspot.com/)  Take only what you can afford to spend because the prices are so good I see people drop a few thousand on a sale that is held in a room no bigger then a 2 car garage.  

**Santee Alley**
[Santee Alley]  (http://www.thesanteealley.com/) Parking is the biggest downfall around here, public restrooms are not free (only 1 for several blocks that I know of).  Its hit and miss in the Alleys but I scored my favorite pair of shoes here for $15 and found them on Amazon later for $80.  Lots of stores where everything is $1, lots of knock off MAC, accessories for Iphones, fake IDs, Pirated DVD movies (dont waste your money), and lots of cheap clothes and socks.
[Roger Stuart Clothes] (http://rogerstuart.com/) Mens clothes &amp; suits.  

**Big Warehouse Blow Outs**
[Weekend Warehouse Sales Southern California]  (http://www.warehouseweekends.com/california/southern-california/)  If you have the time and get to these sales early enough you will score.  I make a generous second income buying stuff at these sales then holding on to the goods a few months.  These are for serious shoppers, they are huge, and have 30-40 tables to ring you up.  Expect hundreds of people by noon, because the discounts are huge.  e.g. $200 Designer jackets are $20.  $50 tops for $10.

**Reddit Favorites**
[It's A Wrap] (http://itsawraphollywood.com/)  This is the clothing outlet for major Hollywood Studios, and portions of the proceeds are donated to charity!.
[Black Market]  (http://www.blackmarketla.com/) Im going to check this little gem out soon. I see artsy things for the home, Hello Kitty, and fun accessories on the website.  
[Dish Factory Outlet] (http://dishfactoryoutlet.com) Website shows current selection and prices.  [Ski Wear Outlet] (http://www.yelp.com/biz/ski-wear-outlet-santa-clarita)

**Flea Markets/Swap Meets**
[Musician Swap Meet] (http://www.musiciansswapmeet.net/) temp suspended till further notice.  [Rose Bowl Flea Market] (http://www.rgcshows.com/RoseBowl.aspx) 2nd Sunday of the month.

~~The sites will be taken down for twenty-four hours in protest of SOPA, r/LA would be replaced by a splash page linking you to [r/SOPA](/r/SOPA) and information on how to contact LA representatives.~~

~~Thoughts?~~

As juaquin and so many others have mentioned, the **[reddit site will be going down as a whole on January 18th from 8am-8pm EST](http://blog.reddit.com/2012/01/stopped-they-must-be-on-this-all.html)**.

Exercise your right to voice your opinion. Instead of fighting against [someone wrong on the internets](http://xkcd.com/386/), try it out in real life! Contact your representative today!

Also, as many have mentioned in this thread, this is a great opportunity to protest the bill IRL. Via the great link by lectroid, I found out that my congressman will be holding a [town hall meeting this Saturday](http://bradsherman.house.gov/) which I plan to attend and express my views about SOPA.

Tue/Thur: 9 am - Noon
Fridays: 10 am - Noon

I just called the Phil hotline and the rep told me that the only Fridays there won't be rehearsals will be the following:

1) Smokey Robinson (7/20)
2) Norah Jones (8/10)
3) Diana Krall (8/24)

I would still call the Phil ahead of time just to be sure (especially on Fridays). Parking at the Bowl is FREE. The entrance is FREE. You can bring food and beverages into the Bowl.

She also couldn't make the afterparty, and that's sad, because she's spent the last two months making this entire event happen.

A lot of people don't realize the sheer amount of work that goes into planning a party for 450 people, from all of the phone calls and meetings with various venues, getting all the permits, budgeting every last thing that happened (the food was pot luck, but there was quite a bit of money spent on all the little things yesterday, so [please donate](http://redditla.com/grmud/)), and keeping track of the myriad of details that pop up in the six weeks before the event.

On day one, Margo was the posting to figure out where we should hold the event. Margo brought together the entire group of volunteers, she organized us, she oversaw all of the budgeting and planning, and she sent out daily and sometimes hourly emails to people to make this whole thing happen. She was an amazing planner and coordinator, and without her, this event would not have happened as it did. She deserves a huge amount of respect and thanks for all of us who attended.

I'll give a shout out to all the other volunteers (Dan, Alex, Supriya, Jason, and Dave, everyone who helped set up, and everyone who helped tear down) who worked their butts off as well. But Margo deserves a large heaping serving of appreciation for what she did. Rather than talk about her at length when she wasn't there at the end, I figured we could do it here, so she'd have a chance to bask in the happiness and post-GrMUD glow.

Please give Margo some love and applause in the comments, and let the 13000 people here who didn't go know what you thought of the whole shindig. :)"	t5_2qht0	True

Yelp the place before you go, don't take my word for it. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
EDIT: Sorry I suppose I should've elaborated. 

Details - Went to this place to get some standard maintenance (oil change, tire rotation etc.) as I'm making a big drive soon. Our Front Driver Side lock had been acting funny (not responding properly to the buttons on the keys, failing to autolock when car's in motion etc.) so we had them look at that. After a checkout they also told me my Valve Cover Gasket had 'just started leaking' and should probably be replaced. A cheap part, but $200 labor. (I've since looked this up and it appears to be a 15 minute procedure, so shame on me for not being smart and learning my own maintenance). The door lock is busted because it needs a new actuator. 
Ok fine, that's $300 maintenance and $87 part. That with all the other maintenance adds up to about $980, which was fine, I could live with it. 

We get the call the next day that the car is done, so go to pick it up. My wife tests out the button lock from her key, and not only is the drivers side lock not working, now all 4 door locks are somehow magically broken. The sales advisor tells my wife that the locks on all 4 doors have been replaced, and says, 

""Oh, just give it a few days and it'll kick in""

WTF? Only the driver side was broken and that's not even fixed. He calls me, and tells me no, only the 2 front doors have been fixed. Why they would even touch the passenger door that was working, I don't know. 

""Oh sometimes when you fix one door it breaks another""  

When I asked to speak to a manager, he would not tell me their name or contact number.

So now I'm thinking, ok, fix the car, knock some money off the price for the inconvenience of having to drop the car off a second unplanned day of maintenance, not to mention the piss-poor customer service.Then the guy calls me and has the balls to say that he's willing to give me labor free on the passenger side door (that they broke), but I have to pay for the part. I call bullshit, he gets the part thrown in free, but still not making any good. I really think getting some slack cut on the $980 for this amount of incompetence and runaround is not terrible, some small gesture to patch up the relationship would've been perfectly acceptable. 

Wrapping it up I then spent 3 hours going up the chain of managers and getting runaround, finally ending at a guy who claimed to be GM of both service and parts, and his statement was essentially that I should be happy they were eating the cost of the labor and parts to replace the passenger lock, that they broke. He wasn't making enough money off the deal anyway. Not a blink at the fact that they did not fix my original problem properly or on time in the first place, or that a dozen lines of bullshit had been fed to us from the Sales Advisor. 

At this point it's a case sent up to Honda Corporate, who've been very nice. I just want a fixed car that's not going to explode on some stretch of desert in Arizona.

 EDIT2: Thanks everyone who shared their stories of getting fucked by this place, and also to everyone who shared their wisdom on how to protect yourself as a consumer. If it makes you all feel anybody I told the guy his shop was the worst fucking chickenshit clown show ripoff shop I'd ever seen and they earned their shitty reputation with flying colors. I know it's the low road but it felt really good to curse this dumbass out.

1355934118.0	15447o	I was arrested for felony possession of marijuana in Burbank, CA that I bought from a dispensary with my doctor's recommendation (throwaway)	petemillersteakho	236	53	220	"Hello all.  This is a throwaway account.  Was driving home around midnight about 2 months ago.  Got pulled over by Burbank PD.  Officer said I was swerving.  I believe it was not true.  I passed the field sobriety test.  Officer said I am searching your car.  I said, ""No, I do not consent to any searches.""  

The smell of marijuana is probable cause for one to be searched; either your body, your car, or your house.  He said he smelled weed so he proceeded to search my car.  

He searched my car and found less than a gram of concentrated cannabis inside my zipped backpack, which came from a dispensary, purchased with my doctor's recommendation, still in its original labeled container.  

During the long search of my car the officer ran down my car's battery because the dome light was on the entire time.  Because the battery was dead and the windows were down the officer had my car impounded.  

After the officer found the marijuanas, I told him to look at my signed and current doctor's recommendation.  He found the note, read it, and then arrested me.  He didn't verify if it was real.  He didn't call his supervisor.  He said concentrated cannabis is a felony regardless.  

I was arrested, charged with a felony, and my bond was set at $10,000.  I was charged with 4 different offenses.  1) Felony possession of concentrated cannabis 2) Possession of marijuana (infraction) 3) Crossing the double yellow line (infraction) 4) Failure to stay in one's own lane (infraction).  

The next month was pretty intense.  In order to save money I decided to represent myself.  I am not an attorney.  I spoke to 8 different lawyers.  I sat down with 4 different lawyers.  I tried to get the ACLU to represent me.  (They did not).  I was told by the public defenders what I should do.  

I had to get a notarized doctor's note from my doctor.  The doctor is 86 years old and had lost his license to practice medicine since he approved me for MMJ.  It was a pain in the ass but I finally got the notarized letter.  I had to get my hearing advanced twice so I could take care of all of this before Thanksgiving.  I brought the letter into court and the prosecutor dropped all 4 charges.  It was a plea deal so in order to get the charges dropped I had to agree to forfeit all seized evidence.  

I tried to get the ACLU and a second private attorney to sue the Burbank PD for arresting a medical marijuana patient.  They could not help me.  

I was left with a ridiculous $1000 bill from the bail bondsman, a $300 impound fee for my car, and a felony arrest record which will follow me for the rest of my life.  And I feel I've done nothing wrong.  

I made a complaint to the Burbank watch commander because I believed it was an illegal stop, illegal search, and illegal arrest.  The watch commander cleared the officer of any wrongdoing.  The Burbank watch commander even told me, ""I encourage our officers to make these kinds of arrests.""  I was speechless.  He mentioned that he wouldn't want any kids trying concentrated cannabis.  

I told the watch commander concentrated cannabis is covered by prop 215.  He said its not.  I told him that in 2003 the attorney general said concentrated cannabis is protected under prop 215.  There are many many stores in LA that sell concentrated cannabis.  I told the watch commander that pot brownies are ""concentrated cannabis"" so would he arrest me for that?  He just smiled and laughed and would not give me a straight answer.  He said pot brownies are illegal and the FDA doesn't allow them because they are food products.  

Thanks for listening reddit.  I just wanted to vent.  This whole thing has been very traumatic for me.  I don't have emotional support from my family in this matter.  If you have any suggestions/comments I'd love to hear them. 

I'm 27 years old and its fucked up to say the only thing I have learned from this whole mess is to **NEVER SPEAK TO THE POLICE.  **

1315942079.0	keiwg	After three months in LA, here's what I've noticed:	karabekian77	205	30	263	"(I moved here from Miami for better opportunities in the field of education)

1. The traffic is bad, but not as bad as I expected.  Yes, there is heavy congestion and it can happen at any time, day or night.  Big difference, however, is that people seem to be much more respectful of traffic laws.  I see exponentially more turn signals here than I did in Miami.  I see far fewer cars running red lights or turning from non-turn lanes.  Metered highway entrances?  They tried it in Miami, no one followed the rules, so they took most of them down.  

2. Somewhat related to #1, people here do not know how to cross the street on foot.  It might be because the sheer number of walkers is higher, but I've seriously seen more people cross incorrectly in the three months I've been here than I did in my whole life in Miami.  My theory: in Miami, if you walk in front of a car, that driver will make sure to hit you or at least scare you so that you learn never to do it again.  Here, people are a lot more laid back so they'll generally stop for you and let you cross.

3. The rent is *not* too damn high, it's about the same as Miami.  I'm paying about $30 more per month now than I did in South Florida, and while my new apartment is noticeably smaller than my old one, it is in a much more central area. 

4. Going along with #3, the slight difference in rent is more than made up for by the vast difference in power bills.  In Miami, I would routinely pay around $100 per month from about April to November (this was with central air in a one bedroom apartment.)

5. Despite the stereotype that things are expensive in Southern California, EVERYTHING is cheaper here or, at worst, comparably priced.  Supermarket prices?  Much cheaper.  Dining out?  Much cheaper.  Drinking?  So much cheaper it hurts me to know how much I used to spend.  Gas?  About the same, maybe a few cents more expensive in the nicer areas. 

6. People here are much more polite than in Miami.  I have had many people hold doors for me or, conversely, thank me for holding doors for them.  Also, my students are much more respectful than they were in Miami.  The school where I teach now is, if anything, in a ""worse"" area than where I used to teach, and yet the students still have manners and know how to be respectful.  While middle schoolers are still middle schoolers, I feel like I am finally teaching humans as opposed to the beasts that Miami parents call children.

What's the point of this whole post?

I love it here, thanks for having me, LA.

I'll bring wood and some snacks - please bring combustibles and edibles and some beer!  There are local bars, so if an older group wants to come earlier and hang out in a bar until 10, that'd work.  I will be in Prince o' Whales bar starting at around 9, so feel free to show up any time between 9 and 10 and go there.  I'll have a trollface on a stick.**

All of the rest is historical and useless.

In the last meetup post, we seem good with three ideas:  Yamashiro, beach, or Griffith.  However, FreetheBeacheez already independently created a post in /r/meetup (and on meetup.com),
http://www.reddit.com/r/meetup/comments/cfhza/los_angeles_update_for_june_19th_none3_meetup/, in which he's basically saying COME TO SANTA MONICA PIER AT 5 PM.  That would negate the bonfire concept, but at least it's a venue.

I haven't heard from pejasto regarding Yamashiro, so I'm not sure it's a reality.  Nobody seems to be fighting for Griffith at all, so that's out.

I was at the meetup last night at Hotel Figueroa and it was fairly well attended (with a **lot** of cool people!).  I'm betting that if this gets 50-100 upvotes, we'll get a similar number attending, so PLEASE UPVOTE THIS."	t5_2qht0	True

I've got the closing shift (6pm til there are few enough people that I can justify going home) at my bar on Christmas eve and I don't want it to be full of sad drunks, so I'm making it a party.

- I'll make cookies and other baked goods! (From scratch, not crap dough you find next to the margarine)
- I'll be giving out (FREE) holiday-themed shots!
- Free games of pool!
- Bring your ipod and I'll play whatever you want (if it doesn't suck or get vetoed) 
- I'm also trying to work out if I can do happy hour pricing!

I'm trying to avoid a shitty Christmas eve in an empty bar. And some of you are probably trying to avoid a shitty Christmas eve in an empty apartment. Let's make the best of it :)

I'll post updates when I figure more stuff out



**Update!**

Everything is set! Can't do a full happy hour, but I will have some drink specials for you kids. And I'm about to run to the store to buy cookie ingredients (and possibly weird specialty holiday mixers). Seems like it'll be a decent crowd, and I'm a little bummed about losing my internet anonymity!

It was crazy. I think I used the site a total of 4 times and only sealed the deal with one of their listings. I am in the process of building something a little different because I am also offering the ability to find roommates too www.flatscore.com best part is** it's free**. If you all hate WSR and the current options that are available as much as I have been reading on here why don't you tell me what you want so I can create it for you?

We went live a couple of months ago and have had a lot of positive feedback so far. I have been spending a lot of time on filling shared listings for finding roommates which has been super successful. Now I am interested in filling empty apartments.

[Side note] If you are in property management and want me to personally help you fill a listing PM me. I am creating custom pages for each management company but only on request. The first 10 management companies to sign up will get tons of free services including me personally helping them fill their places.  

New features coming very soon (less than a month):
*Connect with current roommates
*Split bills/rent with roommates and get notified via email when they're coming up
*Get references from past roommates
*Rate current and X # of past roommates

We are a group of guys and girl (Yeah Tiffany!) that are extremely dedicated to making a better system and building better relationships between tenants, landlords, and roommates. I am excited for the future because we have some amazing game changing features (not mentioned) in the pipeline for the near future :)"	t5_2qht0	True

From Facebook:

""Hi friends. Last night 2 of my little trailers were stolen from my rental Lot at 3160 Riverside Dr.. They were very rare and very special, the ones stolen were the Bright Orange Uhaul CT and the Purple Scamp, both were vintage Ultra lights. the Orange ones license plate was 4bx4702, there purple one did not have a plate. The lock on the gate was cut and the locks on the trailer hitch were gone. It was obviously a planned thing. Very bummed out here, if anyone see these things on the road there VERY HARD TO MISS.. again, please keep a look out and thanks...!""

Please contact the poster and/or police when you see these trailers! They are rare and the design is unique so they can be easily identified.

Also please write down the license plate number of the vehicle towing if you see it!

Thanks

""But wait, imnion, who died and made you weekend list king?!"" I'm so glad you asked. Basically, I'm frustrated at the lack of a good LA weekend event guide. I want to bring these back and make a couple of changes to fix that.

1. The posts usually go up on Friday. It's nice to post it a couple days earlier and have time to make plans if someone posts something interesting.
2. I want to track past suggestions on a Google Doc (forthcoming) so you can look back on past weeks for more ideas.

**So, r/LosAngeles, what are you doing this weekend?**

Feel free to list Thursday events, too. I'll start the list (and edit this post with updates):

* First Fridays at Abbot Kinney - Venice - [Info](http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/blog/first-fridays-abbot-kinney-boulevard-welcome-neighborhood)
* First Fridays at the Natural History Museum - Exposition Park - [Info](http://www.nhm.org/site/activities-programs/first-fridays/march-2013)
* Wayne Federman International Film Festival - Beverly Grove - [Info](http://www.cinefamily.org/films/the-2nd-annual-wayne-federman-international-film-festival/)

EDIT: Updated with a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoLWJBKH_709dHM1b1ZfYnRWT01nTGktVFpSUGJOZHc&amp;usp=sharing). Let me know if there's more/less info you want. I'll keep it updated.

EDIT2: Thank you all for making this the most popular Weekend List post we've ever had! The spreadsheet is basically updated. I'll have a better system for next week. Enjoy your weekends!"	t5_2qht0	True

I've had a strong urge to move out to LA for 2-3 years now but have been unable to find a job out there.  I was finally able to scrape together the cash for a short trip, and just wanted to share my experiences and thoughts on the city (or the small part of it that I was able to see):

Day 1
Went to the Griffith Observatory and checked out the view of the city.  This was actually my favorite part of the entire trip.  I live in the Philly area right now and we don't have anything that even compares to Griffith Park.  It was about 2pm on a Thursday and it was still packed - my favorite thing about LA was that people really do embrace the weather and beautiful scenery.  I saw more people walking, jogging, hiking, etc than I normally see in an entire month back in Phllly.
 
Ate shrimp burritos at Tacos Delta in Silver Lake.  This also happened to be my favorite meal of the trip.  I should have done a better job of spreading my favorite experiences out.
 
Went downtown at night and had drinks at the rooftop bar at the standard.  I can't say much about this place; I had flown in from the East Coast on an early flight, so at this point I was awake for close to 24 hours.  My friend and I ordered beers that came in a large boot-shaped glass; I drank about half and almost passed out at the bar because I was so tired.  Called it an early night.

Day 2

Went on a 5 mile run when I first woke up through Los Feliz.  I got alot of good pictures there.  Beautiful area.

Drove through Beverly Hills; it was a cool experience but I didn't see as much as I expected to.

Stopped at the Saddle Ranch on the way back and drank the best Bloody Mary I ever had.  They had a few different Bloody Mary's on the menu - I can't remember the name of the one that I got, but it had BBQ sauce in it.

At dinner at a Vietnamese place called Blossom.  It was the first time I ever had Pho.  It was good but not great.

Went to the 4100 bar in Silver Lake and had a few beers, and also did Pickle-Back shots for the first time. 
 
Caught a burlesque show at Harvard and Stone.  The band was great and the girls were beautiful but it was a bit of a disappointment.  We were there for almost an hour waiting for the band to start - they played 2 songs and then stopped.  We waited for another hour before leaving and they hadn't started again yet.

Stopped at some dive bar on the way home that had a free hot dog buffet.  There needs to be more places like that.

Day 3
 
Walked the boardwalk at venice and saw some of the street performers; saw the basketball courts from American History X.  
 
Walked along the venice canals.
 
Drove through Santa Monica and Malibu and up the PCH; had lunch and drinks at Duke's in Malibu (the only shitty food I had while I was here).  
 
Stopped at the Den for some drinks.  
 
Had dinner at Chateau Marmont.  Tried a bunch of food here and it was all very good, I recommend the Wesley's Chicken.
 
Drove up through the hills to Mulholland drive at night.  
 
Day 4
My last day in LA.  Pub crawl for St Patty's day.  I don't remember much from this day, but it was a great ending to my trip.  Went to alot of cool bars and drank some good beer.  My only regret is that I didn't make it to In and Out Burger like I had planned.

LA exceeded all my expectations.  The food was great and so were the people, and I can't say enough good things about the city itself.  I really hope I can make it out there permanently some day.

r/LosAngeles [RDDoS](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/day/rddos-2012/) is just a week and a half away (9/22/12). What seems to be the moon and starts aligning, a perfect opportunity to work with Create Now appeared.

Several r/LosAngelesers met a few weeks back to discuss what to do for this day and by coincidence Kelly from Create Now contacted us just a week ago about their non-profit in Los Angeles and how they've partnered with redditdonate.com

I'll let Kelly say it in her own words:

&gt; Hi,

&gt; I'm the Development Assistant for Create Now, an arts mentoring nonprofit located in Los Angeles. We help connect foster and homeless youth with skilled professionals in the arts. The goal is to provide young people with skills, guidance, and job opportunities to help end the cycle of poverty that they're often caught up in.

&gt; We've recently partnered with Reddit Donate and would love to invite you to learn more about our organization at our website: [http://www.createnow.org](http://www.createnow.org). We've been verified through a number of channels to participate in the Reddit Donate project and can also provide additional information such as our 990 form, and 501c3 letter if needed.

&gt;I think partnering with r/losangeles would make a lot of sense for us, as we are a small local charity. If you haven't considered a charity to post on your sidebar and run a campaign for, we would love to be considered! If you have any questions, feel free to PM /u/CreateNow.

Sunday the 23rd they also have a event called Zamfest.

&gt;Starting tomorrow, we'll be putting several hours into recruiting people for Zamfest on Sunday, September 23. If r/LosAngeles was still interested in helping for the Reddit Day of Service, we'd love to have 20-30 people to count on to help us out! Here is the link to the 

&gt; Zamfest webpage: http://www.zamfest.com

&gt;We'll have a 20x20 tent set up with a donation station, as well as two arts and crafts projects (decorating paper guitars and maracas for a few dollars each), as well as hosting a drum circle which will be free to any who are interested. We're looking for anyone who can help us set up/break down, take donations, or help assist with arts and crafts and the drum circle.

&gt; Let us know if you guys were still interested! 

If you would like to contact Kelly please email her at kelly@createnow.org.  [I have created a Meet-Up page ](http://www.meetup.com/LA-Redditors/events/82051342/) for those interested in the event so we can track volunteers and make it easier on Kelly so she isn't swarmed with emails, PMs and phone calls. 

So there you have it r/LosAngeles. Are we ready to step for the cause? Are we ready to do something for RDDoS?And if everyone agrees I am going to put the redditdonate.com button in our sidebar! Check out /r/graphic_design as an example of the button.

Sadly, I will be out of pocket that weekend and can't attend, so I am looking for someone to take the lead in organizing us and working with Kelly. I'll do everything in my power on the reddit side to get the word out, I just won't be able to be there in person.

**EDIT** This just in. If you want to be a volunteer sign up here: http://www.tfaforms.com/212588

This will be the easiest way for Create Now to keep track of the volunteers and will make sure we're covering all of our bases legally. No one will be contacted for other volunteer opportunities unless they've indicated an interest beyond Zamfest."	t5_2qht0	True

I have also posted this to [r/missingpersons](http://www.reddit.com/r/MissingPersons/comments/k1ff7/tommy_lam_pasadena_ca_missing_since_11am/) but I think this reddit has more visibility...


My friend's dad went missing yesterday and we're desperately looking for him.  Here is the summary:

* **Name:** Tommy Lam
* **Age:** 64
* **Height:** 5'6""
* **Weight:** 150lbs
* **Hair:** Grey
* **Eyes:** Brown

* Missing as of 11am Wednesday August 31, 2011
* Last seen at Kaiser Permanente on Foothill Blvd in Pasadena
* Was wearing a black checkered shirt, tan pants, brown leather clogs, holding Kaiser Permanente bag
* Has Alzheimers and Dementia and can not make out words other than ""yes"", ""no"", and Chinese gibberish

* Please call the police first if you have any information (**626-744-4241**)
* I also set up the email **help.t.lam@gmail.com**

Thanks for you help.

**Edit Sept 2 8am:** Still not found yet. Sorry I don't have any new news from my friend other than that a search party is forming at the Kaiser Permanente in Pasadena (3280 E Foothill Blvd) Saturday if Tommy is not found.  130pm to 630pm.  There's a facebook event for it hosted by Lisa Lam Hraba called ""Search party needed for Tommy Lam"" but I can't post the link it because I left LA for the weekend and am doing everything from my wife's phone.  If you can't reach me for more details, pm glackk.

**Edit sept 2 11:22am pst:** Please see [glackk's comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/k1fxg/please_help_friends_father_went_missing_in/c2h0t0p?context=3) about Tommy possibly getting on the gold line.

Take precautions and don't leave yourself vulnerable. If you have an iphone get the findmyiphone app and ACTIVATE IT! Lock your windows if you live on the first floor. Don't leave valuables in your car. Have an extra ID and some petty cash hidden somewhere so starting over isn't as hard if you one day find yourself in a situation like I did... no phone, no wallet, no id, no cash, no car, no credit cards, etc. If you are ever getting robbed don't try and be a hero, just give them what they want... possessions are replaceable, your life isn't. That advice kept me alive last night.

If anyone would like to hear the full story of what happened, let me know. 

Also, if anyone has been through a similar traumatic situation I would love to know how you guys/gals dealt with it because I'm pretty messed up. Welcome to Los Angeles.

EDIT - Thanks for all the kind words and the support. It's way easier for me to talk about this anonymously on the internet than it is for me to say it aloud in person, so really, thanks so much for the outlet and all of the advice. My main reason for positing this was as a wake up call, or even just a reminder to remain vigilant and aware that these things happen (not just in L.A., but everywhere) and you should take some action now to reduce your exposure to this sort of crime."	t5_2qht0	True

1338881812.0	ulrqy	I'm an 18-year-old female looking for a Prom date this Saturday. 	PromDateThrowaway	169	48	253	"Hi Reddit! I would love to have a partner for Prom. I thought I might as well try and see how this goes. This is my first time posting something here so I’ll do my best to answer all questions!

About me:

I am 18 years old, Asian, and a bit shy at first. I’m a gamer (I currently play LoL), I also make arts and crafts, and I frequent Reddit and Imgur. I’m also quite short so if you cannot handle having to look down a lot, I’m sorry. (Although I will be wearing very high heels so my dress doesn’t drag) 

Preferences:

To save money, I am sad to say I cannot rent or purchase you a suit/tux. Have some common interests stated above so we’re not awkward penguins. Drink a little (I plan to go to the after-party). Have the capability to meet my parents (who are EXTREMELY nice). Hold unto me because I cannot walk well with my high heels. Be between the ages of 18-21; preferably, be 20 or younger since I need approval for a 21 year old.

If you are a serious candidate, I would love to (for obvious reasons) get to know you first through Skype or something of that sort. Honestly don’t know how this will go so thank you for your time :)


Update: I won't get home until 3 so please don't hesitate to leave a message! I also don't mind if you would like to just be friends on League :) Thank you everyone for your kind support so far! I didn't know there would be so many responses and I'm really glad I came here to find a Prom date. 

Update: Just got home, will get to your questions/comments. 

Update: Here's a picture but gah I know I'll get less potential dates. Oh well! &gt;&lt; http://imgur.com/mwHXS

Update: Update for update's sake on 6/11. I did find a date and we'll post pictures soon! Prom was great (although the after party got raided) :D"	t5_2qht0	True

He is one of the favorites in the race, and could become the next Mayor of Los Angeles. What are your thoughts r/LosAngeles?

I left all my friends back home in Miami, and as much as I want to go back to be with them, it would be suicide on my career. Here in LA, it seems like everybody has their own clique going on, and I'm made to feel like the creepy guy when I try to fit in. 

I'm really not creepy. I'm just a nerdy, gay, late 20's, friendly guy in NoHo that listens to industrial music. Not a plastic person at all. And I'm just having a bad day watching all my friends back home have a great time this weekend via FB posts.

There's a sign that says, ""110, 6th Street, Wilshire Boulevard,"" and it seems driving that direction would take you off freeway. Get in the lane  anyway and stay in it.

I'm okay.  Glad you're doing well.
 
Don't move to LA.  It's a spectacularly bad idea.  Even a tiny one bedroom apartment will run you easily $1500 a month.  This is one of the most expensive areas in the US.  Even if you have a lot of savings, you'll just wind up running through all of it.  The economy here is terrible.  There are no jobs.  Even the health field, a mainstay is getting near impossible.  There's an austerity program here, where they're cutting back on everything.
 
Plus, you'll lose the support system you have in Chicago.  Don't depend on me.  I like to be left alone.  I maybe saw (your brother) once in the four years he was here at USC.
 
If you feel adrift in Chicago, you'll feel really lost here.  I think you should look into school programs in Chicago.  The Chicago school system is the best.  Find a trade you can learn in a year or two, like an X-Ray tech.  You can branch out to do MRIs or CAT scans and make good money.  Or get into an e-commerce program.  Even if these things aren't your dream jobs, they'll afford you a solid base and hopefully you'll get health and other benefits when you land a job.  Once you have your solid base, you can work on what you're passionate about on the side.
 
Nobody moves to LA anymore.  It's too hard to get started here.
 
Sorry to sound bleak but I'm trying to save you lots of grief.

1369929640.0	1fccki	Global Reddit Meetup Day update #3 - We have a location!	barbehque	132	27	129	"After negotiation, pleading, bribing, and doing thing we're too ashamed to admit in public, we finally have a location for what's going to be the biggest Global Reddit Meetup Day ever!

this years Los Angeles Global Meetup Day will be held at:

**[Lafayette Park!](http://www.laparks.org/dos/reccenter/facility/lafayetteMCC.htm)**

We did our best to find a central enough location for everyone, it was difficult to secure a location that wasn't already book/could hold so many people so we hope this will be (at least somewhat)convenient to all of us. 

here's all the details you'll need:

* **Where?** **[Layfayette Park](http://goo.gl/maps/rQmZR)**
* **When?** June 15th 11AM - 6PM
* **What?** Games, food, meeting new people, making new friends!

**BUT THERE'S MORE!!** 

Because hanging out with each other for seven hours isn't enough, we also have an after party! Let's talk about that.


We had a lot of fun at **[Jillian's in Universal Citywalk](http://www.citywalkhollywood.com/dining/jillians.html)** last year, so we're doing that again.

Here's those details:

* **Where?** **[Jillian's in Universal Citywalk](http://www.citywalkhollywood.com/dining/jillians.html)**
* **When?** 7PM most of us will be heading over immediately after, look for the group of exhausted sunburnt people.
* **What?** Drinks! Lots of Drinks! At least for me, Jillian's is a fun mix of food, games, alcohol, and bowling (kinda like Dave and Busters, but Jillians)

**LAST FEW THINGS!**

* If you have not **[signed up](http://redditla.org/form.html)** yet, please do so.
* If you would like to **[donate](http://redditla.org/index.html#chapter-3)** to help make this year amazing you'd be a super neat person and we'll develop an unhealthy crush on you.
* If you know of a company(or own one) that would like some exposure, I highly recommend considering **[sponsorship](http://redditla.org/index.html#chapter-4)**
* Also if you have not signed up on **[meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/LA-Redditors)** for the **[Day Event](http://www.meetup.com/LA-Redditors/events/118578192/)** and **[Night Event](http://www.meetup.com/LA-Redditors/events/122027572/?a=ra1_te)** I suggest doing that too.

**SPEAKING OF SPONSORS!**

We have sponsors!

* So we should all thank **[MY GEEK REVIEW](http://mygeekreview.com/)** for being awesome and offering to help us out to make this Global Reddit Meetup Day amazing for everyone! So again, thank you so much  **[MY GEEK REVIEW](http://mygeekreview.com/)**

* We also have another sponsor. So here's another big thank you to **[SWOON](http://swoonapp.com/)** for believing in us!  Thank you so much **[SWOON!](http://swoonapp.com/)**

My long time friend, Elisa Lam, is currently missing and has been for the past several days. She was last seen at the Cecil Hotel (a youth hostel) on Main Street, on Jan. 31st. 

She is a Canadian tourist (from Vancouver), currently visiting LA. 

Here is her picture and the LA Times report: http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2013/02/missing-canadian-tourist-elisa-lam.html



So please Reddit...if you have any information about her disappearance or her whereabouts, please contact the local authorities. I have seen this community do miraculous feats and I just hope that she is returned safely her to family and friends.

Every year the city puts up the no parking signs at least 4 days in advance of the Christmas Parade.  Every year without fail people park right under these signs and come out crying when they see their car is gone.  The only good thing this year was that a good number of Golden Bridge Yoga members got their cars towed - Karma finally paid them back for not using the TWO parking lots behind their building and instead...they continue to use residential street parking spaces in our neighborhood.

Earlier this week I asked for helping getting home from my abortion appointment in downtown LA. The outpouring of support and offers to help amazed and touched me.

This morning a lovely redditor picked me up outside my apartment (we checked each other out on facebook first to be safe!). She was amazing. I felt relieved and ready to be done with the process on the way.

We got there and the waiting room was packed. I checked in, waited for about half an hour. Filled out some forms, filled out some more forms, then I went in for an ultrasound and the nurse told me they'd call me back in for the procedure in about half an hour.

Fifteen minutes later, I was suddenly filled with a wave of dread and a feeling that I was making the wrong choice. Images of my baby at 2, 3, and 6 months filled my head. I thought of what it would be like to feel the baby kick for the first time. I turned to my awesome companion and said ""I'm getting cold feet."" The room was freezing, so at first she thought I was speaking literally, but then immediately starting talking to me and validating my sudden feelings of dread.
I don't know what changed in those 15 minutes, I knew I couldn't go in for the procedure feeling like I did. 

Being the awesome woman she was, my abortion-day buddy reassured me that there really isn't much of a difference between 5 1/2 weeks and 6 1/2 weeks and that it was fine to take more time to think about it.

I went to receptionist and told her I was leaving, she seemed a little perplexed but it was so busy that she was helping someone else immediately.

We talked in the car on the way home, and then I called my boyfriend when I got home (he's already home for winter break, which was why I needed help from you lovely strangers today). He was thrilled that I didn't go through with it. We're in our early 20's, college grads, and I'm in law school. He wants to keep it.

Anyway, so that's my update. Now I need to decide in the next week or two if I'm ready to become a parent or if my case of cold feet was passing.

I just want to reiterate my thanks to all of you who really made a girl in a terrible situation feel a lot better."	t5_2qht0	True

Sinyakuza	139	38	100	"Really wasn't sure when to post about the restaurant we've been running. At this point, we've been open for over a year. Our first 7-8 months were tough to get people to come in. The city started replacing the main water lines on Glendale Blvd during that time. There were fences up, big holes, sometimes our driveways were completely blocked and there was traffic at all times. It sucked but we managed to survive thanks to yelp and our coffee business. 

For the first year we only offered breakfast and lunch and were open from 8-3 every day. We've been working on our dinner menu and a couple months ago finally started offering dinner and new hours( Mon-Sat breakfast&amp;lunch 8am-5pm dinner 5pm-9pm. Sun breakfast&amp;lunch 8am-4pm ). 

We're located on Glendale Blvd (towards Rowena Ave) next to Fletcher Dr. In a strip mall with a nail salon, laundromat, and a subway. Our address is 2590 Glendale Blvd. 

Come Today(7/22) between 4-9pm and ask for Jon. I'll take care of you and give you a discount for checking us out. But please give feedback on everything you've tried!

Here's [our site to look at our current menus](http://moderneats.com/)

Here's [our yelp page](http://www.yelp.com/biz/modern-eats-los-angeles)

My message box was inundated with questions, support, tips, new feature requests, and people looking for places to live in LA. Thank you so much for all of that! You have no idea how happy you made all of everyone working on this free product :)

Many of you loved the idea of a free West Side Rentals but had a hard time with our site because I had such few listings. I have been working on adding them since then and just added 27 new listings all verified to be scam free (Suck it Craigslist) and am in the process of getting several more. Over the next month we should be able to more than double the number of free verified listings in LA. 

Check out the new listings here (http://flatscore.com/users/view/SCRESINC)

* If you are a real estate broker that does not charge tenants for your services and would like to be on Flatscore send me a message. 

* If you are a management company and would like to market your listings for free send me a message.  

* If you are in LA and are looking for a roommate or an empty apartment message me and I will help you find a place/roommate even if what you want isn't on my site. I will do it all for the price of **free** (and I'll probably ask you to tell your pals about the experience)

EDIT: Thanks again for your overwhelming support! To clarify the link above aren't all of our listings you can find them here http://flatscore.com/places (switch between shared and empty listings at the top of the page)
