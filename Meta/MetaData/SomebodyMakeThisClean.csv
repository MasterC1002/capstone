What I'd love to see is essentially a Google Maps interface on a family tree.  You can zoom, you can scroll, you can find how two people are related (just like getting directions from one place to another), you could print or publish to a website.  Almost all genealogy software uses the standard GEDCOM database format, so I think the data import would be fairly easy - you are just parsing a text file.

A second iteration could have some research functionality or family tree linking.

EDIT:  I should mention that I currently use PAF (via familysearch.org - thank you Mormons), and I've looked at Ancestry.com (too spendy) and geni.com (GEDCOM importing requires $$$ and is kludgey).  Family.Show looks to be the closest to what I'm envisioning, but after trying it I see a couple of limitations:

1. GEDCOM importing partially failed for me.  I had to manually link a number of parents / kids, change a few genders, and it didn't recognize any middle names.

Ideally we'd be able to convince [Andrei Alexandrescu](http://www.serversidemagazine.com/news/10-questions-with-facebook-research-engineer-andrei-alexandrescu/) to take on this problem, as it's a great application for his current research (meme detection on Facebook posts).

A second best would be [Paul Tyma](http://mailinator.blogspot.com/) because he seems to like cool projects like this and mailinator might actually get fwd:fwd:fwds in addition to spam. 

But even if we skip out on the machine learning aspects, we could have it as simple as a system where

1.  someone manually reports a possible science-offending status update (maybe in a subreddit even). 

2. Then people can search manually for the snopes article and link the offending status update to the snopes article that addresses it (the highest upvoted comment containing a snopes.com link is the match).

3. Then for people using the facebook app, it would monitor your feed for something that matches one of the offenders, and if a match is found, it would offer to reply on your behalf with a link to the snopes article.

(Personally, I think we should avoid the temptation to branch out into debunking blatantly incorrect political status update messages. Yes, there are fact-checking sites we could hook up to such a system, but that's just welcoming the psycho-bots to come abuse the system.)"	t5_2rngx	True

However, you cannot ""zoom out"" -- that is, the zoomed field of view can never be larger than the physical pixel resolution of your monitor. This means that if you use a 1024x768 monitor, you can zoom in on an area to magnify e.g. a 320x240 part of the desktop. You also can, in [X11](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X11), run a desktop that's larger than your 1024x768 pixels, e.g. your (virtual) desktop may be 1280x960. But you can only pan around that virtual desktop. You cannot currently ""zoom out"" to get a (lossy but antialiased) view of the whole 1280x960 desktop on your 1024x768 monitor.

I understand that ""zooming out"" in a lossy way obviously isn't ideal, and smaller fonts in particular will quickly become unreadable -- but especially for netbooks with limited resolution screens, this might enable the user to run a higher-resolution desktop and applications that otherwise don't work well on small screens."	t5_2rngx	True

The content itself using Javascript/Canvas etc.Viewable either online or as part of an offline library. 

The database would house the demos with a categorisation and community voting system so teh good ones can be seen.  More importantly  The database should be a mechanism to facilitate the creation of these things.   

As I said in the trig thread,  Most schools would have at least one teacher with some good ideas for what could be made into a good vidual representation.  If they can storyboard their ideas a programmer can implement the idea.  Most schools would have at least one parent of a pupil capable of doing some decent JavaScript and Canvas work.  That makes the very real possibility for people to pair up to make these things.  A website could use the home page of each school as a reasonable unique identifier for people affiliated with the same school find each other.  That's not to say people couldn't collaborate online however.  Another important part of this project would be a collaboration area where people could post storyboards and work on implementations.

1270653910.0	bnokz	Educational MMORPG	jaylaprade	40	12	28	"I have thought about this indepth, but just don't have the coding skills to implement it.

Think of WoW or Runescape, but instead of clicking a million times, grinding away on a skill or in battle, you use trivia type questions to perform the skill.
So for instance,  a mage type class would be able to learn any level spell.  But, when spell memorization takes place, the user is given a Math problem equal to level of the spell he/she is trying to cast.  The world server would send the user the Math problem.  Then later in game time, when the user attempts to cast the spell, the user would be prompted to enter the answer to the Math problem.
Higher levels of casting would require Higher levels of math skill.  Level 20 spells might require advanced calculus.
Likewise we could do similar things with other classes.  A thief class try to open a lock would need to answer a history multiple choice question.  The higher the level of skill required the more complex the question.
Fighters could have questions regarding culture (meh) or maybe even basic skills questions.  ""What are the required fields to be filled out on an envelope?"" at a level one swing, to a level 5 swing which might be some advanced life skill...... ""What is the date that US Federal taxes are required to be filled by?""

Basically, I think that this could be created easily by a developer.  He/She could edit a common open source MMORPG engine and design the basics of the system.  Then create a plugin to a database engine and the format for questions on the world server.
Then using something like SourceForge allow a small privileged community to compile the question/answer list.

I plan to watch it every week and share it with the world. 

On the first week, I create a .torrent called ""WereWolf Diaries, Season 1 - open torrent"".

At first, it is empty apart for a readme.txt file, but as soon as I am ready, I add the first episode. I control the torrent, so only I can add to it.

All of the people who downloaded it (with only the readme.txt file in it), suddenly see a new file added and start leeching off of me.

After a few minutes, it behaves like a normal torrent.

But a week later, a new file is added and BAM, everyone downloads it.

Advantages:

1 ) You automatically get new files that can only come from the real source

2 ) If you don't seed, you don't get the new files, so it encourages seeding

3 ) It organizes .torrent indexes: no more packs of seasons and individual episodes side by side

4 ) You only need to search for the .torrent file ONCE, on the first week, when nothing is in it yet, so it's still a 100% legal torrent. Once new files are added, it could become illegal, but it's already in DHT and no longer require the search engines.

This could of course also be used by indie musicians, to distribute new songs, or my painters to distribute images of their paintings.

1270694724.0	bnxpl	SMT:  A Pokemon iPhone/Droid app.	candidkiss	46	18	55	"First of all, I don't own an iPhone nor do I know how to make iPhone apps. But this idea is just too awesome to contain and I thought I should share.

Okay, the app would be a Pokemon app that has the original 151 characters in it. Once you sign up, it will let you pick just one of the 3 original starter Pokemon (Bulbasaur, Squirtle, Charmander). You can name your Pokemon and look at its stats, but that's pretty much it. As you walk around, however, you'll get little notifications saying that you just found a wild Pokemon and can go into battle with it, with the intent that you can capture it and add it to your repertoire. When you're at home, being there allows you to get more Pokeballs, heal your Pokemon, and look at all your Pokemon and switch them around. You can also manually initiate a battle with a friend who also has the app installed if they are in the vicinity of around 50 feet or something or if you know their phone number.

About wild pokemon: It would start out with basic pokemon such as Caterpies, Rattatas, Pidgeys, etc... Also, depending on the region of the US you are in, as you get higher in levels you find different wild Pokemon to fight. Walking around large bodies of water and coastal cities leads to Magikarps or Seels. Walking in terrain deemed mountainous can lead to Geodudes and Machops. You can only find the super rare Articuno if you're in Alaska and extremely lucky.

I am just imagining something nostalgic and simple that you can easily do as you walk around or are just sitting on a bus or in a cafe. Free app since we probably wouldn't be allowed to make money from Pokemon. Anyone want to take off and run with this?

=====

Edit:  Seems like the Android would be the best bet for this kind of app.  It has multitasking, and is a bit more liberal in allowing apps to go through.

Base unit would have interfaces (sound, midi, power, pedal connector), display and controller buttons.

Same goes for drum pads: a small, symmetric, one hand design, snap together with another, or a third etc. Load your preferred drum config.

Connect sustain pedals, drum pedals, organ pedals too.

1297917705.0	fmz8e	Monster: The best fucking video game ever.	L15t3r0f5m3g	31	13	19	"OK guys this is a biggie. Skip to the tl;dr if you don't have the patience or time.

I had this idea for a video game while driving home from work. Think Spore meets Red Faction: Guerrilla meets Katamari with a little Driver and The Movies thrown in.

You would start as an otherworldly creature, hatching from an egg or some such, depending on your choices for the campaign. From this starting point, you get to design everything about your creature: limbs, movement, attack style - think Spore. You can choose to be a Biological Nightmare (living monster) or Mechanical Menace (robot). Gameplay will differ depending on your choice.

In the first environment, you are a tiny monster/robot baby. You crawl into civilization, and in order to survive, you must destroy. Think Katamari, but instead of picking up objects you smash them - and like Katamari, the stages get bigger and bigger.

Let's say you're in a farmer's garden, having landed on earth cocooned in a rouge asteroid (the campaigns will each have the same tone and objectives, but differing circumstances, like Left 4 Dead but with more customization options) and you start eating his crops to gain strength, which makes your size increase, which makes you dish out more damage. Or, if crops aren't to your liking (if you chose to be a Mechanical Menace instead of a Biological Nightmare) you go for his farming tools or barbed wire fence - if you're a robot, you need metal, and if you're a living being, you need organic material.

Once you have grown to an appropriate size, you can begin to hunt the tasty humans - or tasty farm vehicles. Once the farm has been sufficiently destroyed, the next level begins.

Now you're much bigger, able to see clear over the tree tops. You're on the outskirts of the small town the farmer's land was near. Time to go introduce yourself to society at large. By the end of this level, you will see a fair amount of combat through the townsfolk and the eventual arrival of the National Guard. You're big news now, buddy.

Next up you see the city. You're about eye level with the skyscrapers, ready to chew them into dust. The army will start to hammer you here, and at the end of the level you will have to deal with another monster of your size. You leave the city a smoldering ruin.

The next level sees you at about a mile high, with every step the earth cracks beneath your feet. When you stomp at the ground, the plates shift. It is your duty to sink this continent into the ocean depths, where it belongs. Instead of eating to gain size in this map, you need to destroy enough so that the military uses nuclear deterrents, which in turn (and much to their dismay) make you grow even faster. Soon just the act of walking is enough to sink this hemisphere.

In the final level, you have the entire world's forces pummeling you from space. You must dodge their attacks, even going so far as to use the moon or chunks of the earth as cover. When you've gotten big enough, you give the earth one last ""fuck you"" and kick, throwing it off its orbit and plunging into the sun. As you fly off into space, you wink and give the camera a thumbs up.

Other campaigns can run differently - Where you start in a Japanese fishing village, working your way up to Tokyo, or in a Russian research lab, longing to show the reds who's boss.

Here are added elements to fill out the game:

Play Tone - There would be a tongue-in-cheek style of humor surrounding the game, if you want there to be. It all depends on how you play it. If you want your creature to dance while he commits genocide, then dance he shall, and the news coverage will reflect these choices.

Loading screens - In between levels there would have to be loading screens, as I don't think any engine could support a game world this large while maintaining an insane amount of detail. A TV with color bars would feature an emergency announcer relaying events, ala war of the worlds, keeping track of the monster's growth and movement, as well as reflecting the play tone.

Design - A full on creature design tool would be a must. Everything from laser beam eyes to grabby tentacles and a slug-like bottom would be available, and your choices would decide how your creature approaches combat. If you went for the pre-made King Kong type, you'd be great at close range and have lots of shielding power, but would have to rely on throwing/jumping attacks for long range. As a tentacled menace, you could pull the city apart with your noodly appendages from a distance - lassoing buildings then ripping them out of their foundations.

Moves - A system similar to the old WCW wrestling games (I haven't played the recent ones) where you can customize your creature's move set to your liking. You could conceivably have a pink Cthulhu doing Capoeira across Manhattan. Who would then Moonwalk into the Empire State Building.

Cinema - This would be an option the player can toggle. In cinema mode, you'd have control over the filters (I.E. black and white, film grain, shaky cam, widescreen, slow motion etc) and cameras would be at your disposal on the warpath (during and after you finish the level). These cameras can be CCTV on buildings, cell phone cameras held by panicked citizens (with their own personalized dialog which would mimic your play tone), or helicopters surveying your attack. Once you destroy a camera, you get added points to your total and the camera goes to static. You can then edit the camera angles together (as well as a free cam) to create videos, just like in Driver but on a massive scale.

Points - You get these for completing levels and causing destruction. They carry over from playthough to playthough, from campaign to campaign, and can be spent on new upgrades for your monster (new moves, new monster types or new cinema options). They're kind of like the tickets you get from an arcade that you get to spend on a shitty plastic toy, only here they can be used to buy FIREBALLS THAT SHOOT OUT OF YOUR SPHINCTER.

Multiplayer - I'll let your imaginations run with the potential here.

I really like this idea, but have no idea how to implement it or where to put it. So here you are, Reddit. Make something of this nonsense.

tl;dr: A game where you can play as any monster from your imagination, tearing the planet apart until you grow so large you kick the earth into the sun. You want to read it now, don't you?

The main topics would come with the game - eating, exercise, sleep habits, bad habits, hygiene, professional goals - and along the way, you would be treated to statistics.  

For example, if you smoked a pack a day each day this week, you would get a statistic showing the health risks if you continued that behavior.  On the flip side if you quit, it will tell you each step of the way how your taste/smell is getting better, how much your risk of cancer would drop if you continue, etc.  

Other topics would be user submittable, and could be about absolutely everything from stopping masturbation to cutting down on Reddit.  It would include a simple tool for the user to create their own topics and submit statistics when relevant milestones are achieved.  

This is a totally extra but I think cool idea: have all of this information feed a very simplistic SNES RPG-style story.  If you exercise, for example, your character will gain strength, and so would have a better chance in the upcoming cutscene where he gets in a fight.  Your progress would inform his statistics and how well the story plays out.  Just story based, no real gameplay...just like a choose your own adventure where you make choices by the way you live your life.

Picture this; a simple isometric landscape somewhat like minecraft or wesnoth, users register an account and it logs into their reddit much like the phone app and grabs the relevant data; i for example have 341 link karma and 13,441 comment karma, this let's me set up my castle buy some defences and start to train some troops.  
  
Ideally you'd use all your previous karma on decoration, non-useful adornments and et cetera as to not unfairly unbalance everything, or possibly in a sandbox training mode - then once you're set you throw open the gates to your castle and return to reddit....  
  
A few hours later (5reddit min) you've been posting some epicly erudite arguments in favour of legalizing cannabis bacon for narwhales and your in game mana / money / karma has risen accordingly.  This allows you to add some troops to your legion or some defences to your castle - annoyingly pillagers have already swarmed your castle twice and taken as much karma as they could carry off but not to worry you still have plenty left and reviewing the security tapes it seems they managed to avoid most your traps and ladder up the west wall - well a pot of boiling oil up there should see them off next time, and one the other side for good measure.
  
Let's see, that leaves us enough karma to give our squad of imps all wooden shoes and cloth pants then the archers can have some fire arrows... hmmm, that picture of my cat dressed as link but being called zelda by a dog with a funny look on his face must have just hit 'rising' because a whole bag of karma just turned up and i can afford a human rouge to run with the imps awesome.

1298909668.0	fud9m	[SMT] Independant comment system adaptable to any website.		27	8	12	"Imagine you go to youtube and instead of the usual brainless comments, underneath the video, it's a reddit comment system (complete with upvote and downvotes) made up of the reddit community. I select from a dropdown and it goes from blue to green and now I am looking at slashdotters and logged in with my account. Click again and I'm looking at what the SA forums have to say all without leaving youtube.com. same for twitter, etc.

I'm thinking of two ways of doing this, neither of which are very plausible, but wishful thinking is fun. The first would be to emulate each comment system on a server, you create a new ""reddit-clone"" account and then verify with your real reddit account with a id number post. That way no one can claim your reddit name. Then youtube or whoever wants to participate puts in a bit of code and voila, decent comments! (And instead, if youtube didn't want to participate, I think the comment system could be inserted by a browser plugin).

The other option would be that we set up program where if reddit wanted to part of this system, as soon as the first redditor tried to post a comment, it would automatically create a new reddit submission of the video (all contained in a certain subreddit) and just use the actually reddit comment system instead of emulating it.

1270765970.0	bod9q	[SMT] 3D driving game in the real world, generated from data off the web	MrVercetti	22	7	14	"What I think would be really awesome is the following: a game where you can drive a car anywhere in the world. The basic idea would be to take Google Maps/Earth data as the input, in real time, and then map that 2D map to a 3D world that you could freely explore. You would type in an address, and then just go there, and start driving, and it would kind of look like that place. As you drive, in the background, the program grabs more data from the surrounding areas and starts to build the in-game representation of the real world.

Possible other ideas would be to grab and use geotagged photos and other data, in real time, to render the world in more detail. Obviously, the game world couldn't look exactly as it does in real life, but I think it would be possible to use random building models,  landscape textures, topography info and the satellite images to at least get something of the feeling for most areas, especially given that the exact street configurations would be known from the maps. Any info with lat/long coordinates could potentially be used for the game world, for example photos from flickr or info from Wikimapia.

The game could be purely a sim, or potentially used as a base for other typical driving game activities, i.e. races around the streets, or even GTA-style missions. There could be simulated traffic, pedestrians, etc. The current local weather/time could be incorporated, if desired.

So, the basic concept is: a 3D driving game in a facsimile of the real world, generated by grabbing maps and other data off the web in real time. Thoughts? Presumably there are open source driving games out there, which could be used as a starting point and allow developers to focus on creating the world from available data."	t5_2rngx	True

I've had this problem the past 7 years or so.  Whenever i wake up by alarm or something other than natural arising, I have intense nausea for about an hour or 2.  In this time, eating breakfast is impossible.  i literally gag as if im going to throw up for the first 45 minutes or so im awake.  

When im free to wake up naturally, the nausea is far less intense, and i can basically eat about half an hour or so after waking. 

interestingly, drinking helps.  booze, that is.  waking up after a night of drinking is generally much easier and doesn't include the nausea.

i've had the nausea problem much longer than i've been a heavy drinker, so i don't think the drinking is causing the nausea.  

anyway, from running through the comments, it seems people think it might have something to do with waking up in the middle of a REM cycle.  so, someone should make an app or some standalone device that adjusts the wake-up time of the alarm to align with when you should naturally rise.

1276002254.0	ccpla	[SMT] A software compiler that optimizes its output using genetic algorithms	vagueware	22	6	9	"I have long been fascinated by genetic algorithms and their ability to find optimal solutions that humans would not instinctively attempt (e.g. [radio antennae](http://bit.ly/duIUA6) that look quite odd, but are optimal).

I also think that modern computing architectures are reaching a point where systems engineers are ""guessing"" as to what is optimal (have you seen how many instructions are available on a modern chip? How can anybody know the optimal way to handle all of that junk?). As a result it may be that solutions we would not attempt are in fact more optimal. 

I also think there is the possibility to use other components within a machine (video card is one being used already, FPGAs less so but with massive potential) to produce dramatically better performance either in terms of clock time, memory management or other performance factors we're interested in, but no compiler designer would be able to reasonably factor in when designing a compiler.

What I propose is a compiler where we can provide several seeds of how an operation could be conducted. A very trivial example:

a = b * c

We need to explain this is:

* An assignment (that must always happen)
* We can do the assignment on the result of the processor's machine code for multiplication (b MULTI c)
* We can do the result of the processor's machine code for addition (LOOP c times: b + b)
* We can do the addition trick on c, looping b times
* We can do this in many different ways using different registers
* We can do all the above but farm it off to a graphics card
* If an FPGA is around, farm it off to there by using some VHDL
* Heck, if we've got access to a cloud or a supercompute cluster there is a load of code here to do it over there
* Depending on context, you might want to change which registers or techniques are used by other components executed before we get here
* And so on...

You build up these building blocks of basic operations and more complex ones (including code to sending it off somewhere remotely).

Sometimes I'll want to say ""if this cluster of code takes more than x time to process, consider a mutation where it's sent off to a remote instance"", or whatever, but not have it try it for everything

At compile time I tell it which architectures I want to use (so can disable FPGA, cloud computing, graphic card use), and say ""I want an optimal version of this program I have written in C/C++/Ruby/whatever producing for this architecture""

The compiler goes through multiple mutations based on the set of different ways of achieving the same goal at an atomic level we have described, looking for the ""best score"" based on what we care about when setting flags: performance, memory usage, cost, etc.

Each generation is benchmarked and so we do this not for things like ""find me the optimal way to add two numbers"", but for non-trivial scenarios like a kernel or major piece of infrastructure.

Eventually we get something we can execute on that architecture that is optimal according to the constraints we set: things are faster or more efficient than they would have been using a traditional multiple-pass compiler.

This has the further bonus that we don't care as much about the quality of the code going in with regards to optimization. Obviously good code written with performance goals in mind will likely score close to our optimal result in fewer generations (do we want to put known ""bad"" instruction sets in our seed algorithms to see where they mutate?), but bad code will eventually get mutated into more optimal code that is functionally - at a higher level of abstraction - identical to what the programmer intended.

Obviously buggy code will produce a buggy result, but if we have great test coverage and the software is ""release candidate"", part of the release procedure would be to go through the GA compiler to find the optimal compiled binary for a target infrastructure, or more likely release engineers would produce multiple versions, (possibly that could be used to ""breed"" better versions), or if open source the end-user would be able to state what they care about.

There are of course constraints we'd have to worry about in future iterations: a mutation that is optimal in one environment might behave very differently if the kernel has to context switch more because in the real world it's in a ""busier"" environment, for example. That's a problem left for another day... :-)

Maybe make slight improvements but basically a lot of lines. The thing that makes it is that it's and an MMO and that there is absolutely no AI.

There are two teams each with their own planet at opposite sides of the board (potentially you could expand to support multiple teams later on). 

Missile Command Part:

When you first start you are assigned to a missile turret. Your job is to defend the bases next to your turret. (Duh) Pilots from the opposing planet are trying to destroy your planet either by bombing or with kamikaze attacks (though a kamikaze attack would send them back to the beginning). If you survive without losing either your turret or your designated bases for a set amount of time you graduate in rank from turret operator to pilot. In this set amount of time you may be able to earn power-ups based on the number of pilots you take down or how long you play (if you defer the promotion).

Asteroid Part:

In the middle of the two planets is an asteroid belt. As a pilot you are not only trying to destroy asteroids so your other pilots can get through, but also battle on coming pilots. 

There could also be a tower defense aspect. You could capture asteroids and either build improvements on them (gun turrets, tractor beams that would make them ""heat-seeking"", mines to allow bases on the planet to be rebuilt, or atomic bombs which make the asteroids into huge mines). These would continue to exist (flying from one edge of the board to the other indefinitely) until they crashed into a pilot or where shot down. Again, you'd accrue these upgrades based on kills or time on the board.

The ultimate power ups would be the ability to generate worm holes or warp. Worm holes would act like one way portals where anything can pass through them (put the start worm hole in the asteroid belt and the other right next to your opponents planet so they were bombarded with asteroids). Warping would require a great deal of energy which would only charge so quickly, but allow you to instantly appear anywhere on the board you chose.

SO there it is. I feel like the graphics and mechanics wouldn't be too hard. This is just basically a bigger version of games that existed in the 80's. But the MMO part would be what made it so addicting. The legend board would show the user with the all-time most kills, all-time longest survive rates, etc. Also more upgrades could be added later.

1306252752.0	hiz6p	[SMT] A Website/App/Program That Tells You Exactly What To Eat		21	4	22	"There should be a system that tells you exactly what to eat and when to eat it to be healthiest. You would tell it your height, weight, age, gender, goal weight, favorite foods, times when you wake up and sleep, amount of activity you do, and other information. Then, it would tell you what to eat at every meal and the best times to eat those meals.

It could be like Pandora radio in that you could say you like something or dislike it. If you dislike it, it will replace that meal with some alternative until it finds something you like. It should also allow you to specify a certain meal that you are in the mood for. If you picked a meal outside the plan, it would adjust the rest of the plan for you to compensate for whatever you ate. You should be able to tell it you're tired of a food or not in the mood for it. If you tell it that, it wouldn't suggest that food again for a certain amount of time.

Most people wouldn't be able to stick to exactly what it said all of the time, so you should be able to tell it when you didn't do what it said and have it adjust for you. There should also be a snack button that the user pushes when he or she wants a snack. The system would take into account what has been eaten recently, what is planned to be eaten in the future, and then tell you the optimal snack.

There should be a page that tells you what you will need to buy to be able to stick to the plan for an amount of time that you specify. It would tell you ingredients you will need and the like. Maybe it could eventually even link to an amazon shopping cart or something where you can buy it all instantly and have it delivered. 

This system would remove any hassle from eating healthily. It wouldn't be too strict because it would adjust to what you do. It would eventually learn exactly what you like and dislike. Shopping for groceries would be very easy. A lot of people don't want to have to think about what they eat. Currently, that means that they are probably not eating healthily.

Essentially a user would create an account, which would then allow them to begin building their ""wardrobe"".  They could search by designer, and then by year, line, style, etc. to find the piece they own.  Then they would add it to their wardrobe.  
In the case of vintage items, things not found online, etc. the user could be prompted to upload a picture of the item and supply relevant tagging information.  

A bunch of useful tools could then be built around a user's wardrobe.  Off the top of my head I can think of things like outfit creation - the user uses a color wheel to pick a few colors they want to base an outfit off of, and the website pulls color data from wardrobe pictures and adds into it some basic fashion rules and such before returning a generated outfit of pieces the user owns.  
Additionally, the user could create outfits him/herself and save them.  

Another tool could of course be shopping - buttons for _Find Similar Items_, _Find More from Designer_, etc. would be quick links to relevant designer's sites, shopping sites, etc. or the site itself could have a shopping area.  

Users could make and follow friends - they would get updates when friends add new items to their wardrobe and even recommend clothes to them.  Communities could start secondhand shops and trade services.

What do you think?  Is it do-able?  Does it already exist (with men's fashion too)?  I'd love to see it made if it doesn't.  Revenue would be possible too through shopping and such.  Maybe a premium user scheme?

*  
*  
What I want is a program to split my monitor into usable chunks. Each of the open windows in that image would be a chunk in this example.
*  
*  
A chunk is an area that any program/window can be dragged into, and that program/window will be resized to the size of the chunk and snapped into the position of the chunk.
Any program/window should only be resized and snapped if you hover on a chunk. Programs/windows should not snap to a chunk if you are just casually resizing. The only time snapping would occur is if the program/window is put into a chunk.
If you start moving again or the program/window is not released into the chunk, then the program/window will go back to the size that it was before you started to move it.
*  
*  
You would be able to create, remove, resize, and delete chunks.
You should be able to have as many chunks as you want.
*  
*  
Chunks should be able to overlap and the longer you hold something over an overlapped chunk, it moves the the next chunk underneath, but this is not necessary.
*  
*  
Chunks should not interfere with the default windows sizing options. (Dragging a window to top of the screen to make the program/window full screen, maximize button, etc.)

Windows 7 64-bit support is what I need.
Multiple monitor support is also essential, as I have 3 monitors with a 4th on the way.

Now the reason for her call was that I got her a very nice weather radio with an elaborate alert system for mother's day and apparently it wasn't doing much good.  I hopped on wunderground and looked up the weather radar and her house was right in the middle of three mesocyclone cells.  During the call, the weather alert finally went off.  I refreshed wunderground and read the verbose Severe Thunderstorm Warning bulletin, issued the minute prior to then.

What good is a warning when it's already happening?

I've been thinking about something to solve this for a while now.  

We have:

- doppler radar with pretty high resolution

1375828654.0	1judbs	[SMT] A website where you can learn things, based on your previous knowledge. In a 'node' system, visually represented.	dirk_b	17	2	5	"The goal of this website is to teach specific facts or principles to it's readers, whatever the reader wants to learn.      

Usually, in order to understand a concept of some complexity, you need to also understand all the parts that make up that concept. For example, in order to understand a neural network, you need to understand how a neuron works.      

What if the user can traverse visually through nodes, each node representing a piece of knowledge. The user can work it's way through the nodes to learn more complex pieces of knowledge.      

For example: The user wants to learn how a biological cell works. He can read the node about biological cells and mark it 'read' or 'understood', or not if he did not understand it. He can now traverse to other nodes, about bigger things such as 'animals' or about smaller parts of a biological cell.        

Every node could contain links to existing literature, articles, lectures, videos, pictures, etc.        

Every node could also have things such as a 'comment' section, or a 'subscribe' function.

Nodes can be added and edited by all users, but moderators would have to have a lot of influence, similar to how it done today on Wikipedia. 

The benefits of this type of learning: 
- The user experiences a sense of improvement through direct visual feedback (a psychological trick that many video games use as well, FYI).
- The user can share and compare his progress with other users.
- It is easy for the user to become aware of he knows and what he doesn't yet know."	t5_2rngx	True

Viewing the weather in this format would allow for some additional interaction:

* Zoom out and smooth the lines to view historical data and trends, or zoom in for hour-by-hour analysis.

It can help you learn more complicated things too once you get into advanced features and [learn a little about designing good flash cards](http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm).

This is useful, but not very attractive for display.

I'm hoping that some kind, brilliant, generous soul will decide to create what, essentially, is a converter of Terraria maps to any useful file format.  

Unlike current options (essentially screen captures), I'd like to capture the full map - in as high of resolution as is possible up to and including full 1:1 scale.  Essentially I could do this now if I did thousands of screen captures and cut-and-paste them together, but I'm not that much of a masochist.

http://wiki.terrariaonline.com/Map_size 

That link contains the various resolution of each map size as well as resolution in feet.

I've found that ~30000x15000 pixels (actually a bit larger) is the largest file that -most- graphics programs can open on Windows.  Photoshop can save and load larger files sizes, though I don't know those limits off-hand as the 30000x15000 stuff would print out at 100""x50"" in size - more than large enough for anything I'd ever need to do. :D It's also the size I've found that work in the google-map image-converting program I use sometimes (it makes tiles out of your image at all zoom levels and outputs the code to display using google maps api).

Anyway, It would be nice if the app could save the map at the highest resolution possible, but this would exceed useable resolution limits for a lot of people.  In my ideal world, I'd be able to select output resolution in pixels or inches/dpi and the program would let me know my current scale (and #pixels used/block.. 1^2, 2^2, 3^2 exc).  

By allowing selection of the PSB format (Photoshops image file format for HUGE files) for anything exceeding 30000x15000 (or so), and .bmp for smaller, you'd cover it all. (While bmp should deal with larger, it flakes out opening in anything by photoshop in my experiments a few years ago.)  Alternately, and fully acceptable would be to create the number of slices required to create the full map at 1:1 scale.

I'm thinking of how many Terraria-folk who have made amazing creations within their Large size Terraria world (mp or otherwise) would enjoy being able to share it online via google maps as a visual record or art, or print out for a poster-size or wall-paper-size piece of art for their wall (geeky - perhaps - but I'm good with that).

One of Terraria's best(?)/most advanced map viewers seems to be: http://www.terrariaonline.com/threads/terraria-map-viewer.4226/ .  It, though does the pixel:block representation or a screen capture of, at most your maximum screen resolution of a 'real' map.  It produces [this](http://amish-external.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/terraria/small.png) when I want [this](http://media-curse.cursecdn.com/attachments/27/95/7411e841c6ecece78a4247a0526ded9b.PNG) (but the entire map, not just a tiny segment).  

Here's the github for one piece of editing software to make things easier... https://github.com/BinaryConstruct/Terraria-Map-Editor.  Here is the [documentation on the .psb \(and .psd\) file specifications](http://www.adobe.com/devnet-apps/photoshop/fileformatashtml/) and the [.bmp format](http://www.digicamsoft.com/bmp/bmp.html) (to make life easy if someone decides to make this :D ).

I suspect my idea is overly clear to anyone who's used the Terraria map viewing options...hopefully it makes sense to a bored programer with time to kill. :D

1. **Add** words to the On-Screen Keyboard's Text Prediction dictionary.
1. **Remove** words from the On-Screen Keyboard's Text Prediction dictionary.
1. **Edit** words in the On-Screen Keyboard's Text Prediction dictionary.
1. **Search** for words in the On-Screen Keyboard's Text Prediction dictionary, as the word list would be to big to manually search.

Wouldn't it be nice to watch the actual content and get on with your life?

Here's how it would work:

1.  Viewers of the live broadcast would run a phone app that is primarily a toggle button.  They hit it when action starts and they hit it again when action stops.  Each hit (timestamp) is uploaded to a server and is averaged with others watching the game (with some buffer on either side, of course.)

2.  After the game is over, the server creates a simple text file that has the averaged time code values.  The video playing device* simply skips to the crowdsourced time code values.  (Think of it like a subtitle file.)

3.  Maybe allow the viewer to fine-tune the timecode locations and have the refined values upload to the server as well.

*This is where it gets dicey.  Ideally this would be for DVR's.  Another option would be to torrent sporting events and then have a VLC plugin that reads these timecode files, but that's far from the elegance of the DVR.

Also, this could be applied to any show to avoid commercials (if DVR's stop doing that).

Common builds could be provided automatically.  Cross-compilation to other architectures should be relatively easy with gcc's cross-compiler.

In addition, one could write a distributed shared-process step, so someone could install an app (like SETI@Home for example) which assists the kernel building website by building peices of code for everyone's configuration profile.

When you send messages out in Farmville for assistance in crops, theoretically you could send that message to a complete and total stranger- why should it matter if it's someone you actually know?

What would be more interesting to me is a social game that involves actual social interaction. What that would entail, I haven't got a clue, but I like the idea of a game that rewards you for knowing things about your friends. Perhaps to get a bonus like you do in Farmville, you have to successfully answer a random question about your friend.

I don't want to downvote submissions, instead I'd prefer them to be 'hidden' in real time [without having to refresh the page]. I feel the 'hide' functionality is just perfect for this.

However [if I were to trace my cursor's movement](http://i.imgur.com/Blvr3.jpg) it's clearly awkward to navigate to the hide button most of the times.

I don't feel like this is a unique problem, and hope such a plugin could be useful for the community. I don't think there exists one yet, at least not one that my google fu could find for me.

Thanks for reading.

Ivebeenfurthereven	30	19	14	"Because it's highly unlikely that reddit themselves would want to tinker with their code and introduce such a thing to everyone's accounts, this could initially be handled by a third-party website (in much the same way that secretsanta is run by redditgifts.com).

To prevent privacy concerns, it is kept *strictly* opt-in - so if you're interested, you opt to tell this website that your reddit account *xxxxx* corresponds with your own Facebook page/Gmail contacts book/etc etc etc.

How to ensure the reddit account name is genuine? Don't give out your password, have the redditor signing up respond to a confirmation PM or similar. The Facebook API allows web applications to securely query your friend list, with permission, so no need to give anyone full access there either.

If enough redditors did this - again, it would probably need official promotion to really take off, and that looks unlikely - you could then be presented with a list of real-life friends who also use reddit!

If this were an official feature, it could be as simple as a little checkbox on your reddit profile ""I want to be contacted...."" and shown at reddit signup. Then it would be highly successful."	t5_2rngx	True

I'm thinking something along the lines of the [Intrade system](http://www.intrade.com/v4/misc/howItWorks/predictionMarkets.jsp).

I am trying to work out the logistics of this market system, specifically, how a new market is created (i.e. can just anyone submit a new prediction, should moderators need to approve each prediction to ensure that it is clearly defined and testable, should the submitter be required to back the prediction with initial karma points, etc.)

It demonstrates that head tracking can be done and that full screen updates can be applied smoothly in response to the head position.  I'm not convinced of the utility of window parallax.  To me it seems like a feature that was added because they developed technology to do it rather than for any intrinsic need.    

If the same tech could be applied to colour adjustment I think I'd be far more inclined to use it.   Every monitor is different so there would need to be a calibration program for the user to move their head around and inform it which output colours map to which observed colours for a given angle.

Obviously, like most head tracking displays,  it could not work for multiple users so you'd need an easy toggle for when you had company, but the most common case for computer use is a single viewer.

Buckwheat469	15	5	1	"Since we now have only the unread comments in the inbox, this may be  a feasible solution to much of the request timeout issues.

I tend to do this for every comment reply in my inbox. 

In order to reduce network latency, it would be appropriate now to include the originating comment and any child comments along with the received comment in an inbox. The hidden layers can be dynamically displayed when the user presses the Context link. The time the server would take to process these tasks would be significantly less than the load on the network for all of the requests due to context searches, especially since we are only seeing unread messages now.

Device Info:
The device was apparently something you hold in hand and a screen points towards sound. What I'm thinking is to have a large wrist watch type thing. Maybe it could even give a short vibration when sound is heard and then have an LED display indicate direction as well as we'll as intensity. That would be exactly what he would want. Anything that can SHOW him the direction of sound would be fine. I was vague because this guy is low income and anything to help in this way would be great. I don't want to hinder those creative juices. Thanks for the details request though. 

Recipient Info:
His name is Beda and he is my gramma's friend. He is a refugee from Africa though I'm not sure which country. He has a wife(who is also deaf) and several children. One way he used the device was for finding his child if he was hurt in the house.

I think the launch loop concept needs more publicity, so someone should make a model of it, demonstrating the following crucial principles:

So is there any reason you couldn't have multiple such RAM dumps?  And a (maybe BIOS-level?) bit of code so you can switch between them by some combination of keys (ctrl-alt-Fkey, maybe?)

This would let you have multiple OSes installed with the ability to switch between them in under a minute (not having to go through the usual bootup stuff for each, etc).

I dont need all the fancy ""Sales Funnels"" or ""Sales Ferriswheels"" or whatever else outrageously complicated sales forecasting nonsense that ALL CRMs come with.

I sell bottled water door to door, and I close customers within 30 seconds of meeting them. I dont need tons of features.  All I want is something that keeps track of my commissions (and thus, what my check should be) as well as let me keep in touch with past customers to ask for referrals, or wish them a happy birthday, etc.

That's it.  A very simple commission/check tracker, and customer reminder/keeper in toucher thing.  Nothing more.  When I sold cars, I needed almost the same thing, so I could keep in touch with past customers and perhaps get a car deal referral.  It dawned on me that this may be a very common need.

So I started developing it, with my limited background in...well everything.   I tried to make it customizable so it will be able to be cross industry (ie: car sales, door to door magazines, alarm systems, etc.)  but i'm not sure what to do to do that. 

Maybe people here can help add settings to my settings tab that will make it possible to easily change features between industries. (ie: remove retention for car sales, but keep it for magazine subscriptions that keep the subs active for a few months)

[My Google CRM](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AisGb4DHEZKxdE51azluZVRKdnRHRzV2dFNOWXVReUE)

Other things I MUST add for it to usable by me in door to door sales:

* Form to easily add customers
* A way to easily email all customers with a birthday in the active months (and who gave an email address)
* a way to add customers to my google contacts into a specific group
* a way to add google calendar events to remind me to follow up with a post card/email/phone call etc for various things.  ie) 10 days after the sale, I send a thank you post card.  Then 1 month after sale, I send a letter asking for a referral.  3 months after sign up, I send an email with pointers and suggestions to keep their service top notch 4 months after sign up, I ask for another referral. during their bday month, I send an email and also a letter


Anyone wanna help make this better?  Any tips?  I suck..so yeah. 

**edit:  the idea was the dashboard tab is the main tab, you merely change the month (via the dropdown) then have a tab to check commissions during any time frame.  a tab to see all bdays for this month for the people that gave an email so i may click a button and send a ""personal"" bday email.  See all my upcoming retention so i may follow up and make sure they accounts are all in good standing so I can get my second ""back end"" retention commission**"	t5_2rngx	True

There is no way to rename Desktops, so you must know keep track of which apps are on which Desktop. Having Desktops specific to a particular task or workflow with Desktop names that reflect this would make Mission Control vastly more useful for some people. I believe I may have come up with a workaround for this based on the way Lion handles full-screen documents, but I don't have the knowledge, skill or time necessary to implement it myself.

The idea is pretty simple: an application does nothing more than open full-screen windows with a user-specified title and background image. 

Since full-screen documents in Lion are treated as their own Desktop, named for the title of the application, would it be possible to create an application that can spawn new processes with their own windows, with each window doing nothing more than displaying a solid color or user-specified background image and possessing a title specified by the user? 

I'm obviously not an OS X programmer myself, but I took a look at the fullscreen API and it seems that is quite a bit of flexibility with respect to window behavior, leading me to believe that this idea is very possibly feasible. The biggest issue I can imagine running into is that I'm not sure there would be any way to assign applications to these fake Desktops like you would with a ""normal"" Desktop, in which case some type of utility for managing this would also be needed. 

Would anyone be interested in investigating this idea? The inability to rename Desktops has been a sorely missing feature of OS X since the Leopard days, and there hasn't been a workable solution yet.

1295382157.0	f4n0n	[SMT] An archive of timestamped snapshots of web pages for citations	kataire	11	0	6	"__In a nutshell:__ A web service maintaining verifiable snapshots of public web pages on-demand.

__Rationale:__ The other day I discussed the problems of creating citations when using web pages. In academia the usual solution seems to be to just name the URL and the time it was visited. Wikipedia has its own suggestions, such as linking to a particular revision explicitly.

There are several problems with all existing solutions. The biggest ones are reliability and integrity. Especially among journalists ninja-edits are the norm, sometimes web pages are pulled for internal reasons or URLs broken in re-launches. The web archive (archive.org) is a partial solution, but it isn't updated frequently enough and not all robots-enabled sites are indexed. Google cache is possibly relevant but neither stable nor exhaustive enough to cover all relevant content.

__Full description:__ My suggestion would be a web service that allows (registered?) users to request the archival of a public web page as a snapshot. The snapshot would be publicly available at a permanent URL (copyright laws apply, so a takedown mechanism for the original publisher must be easily available). The snapshot should be stored in combination with a UTC timestamp of when the snapshot was fetched, the original source's URL, the original source's certificate (if SSL was used), the HTTP communication involved in assembling the snapshot (GET/response for each file), a checksum to verify the snapshot's integrity and a digital signature identifying the snapshot within archive itself.

These snapshots would be stored permanently (unless the removal is requested by the original publisher). If a snapshot is removed, its metadata should persist to prevent URLs from being abandoned. The snapshot itself could either be accessible directly or be available for download. If access to the snapshots is to require a payment or registration, the metadata (including the source URL) must be freely available regardless.

__Why this could work:__ There currently is no sensible alternative for reliable citations of web content, especially in academia. Revisions of print articles are easily identifiable, but digital content is in constant flux. The purpose is primarily to preserve text content (e.g. articles or postings). This service could also be interesting for legal purposes if the service is trustworthy enough and jurisdiction is not an issue.

__Requirements:__ The service would have to be incredibly trustworthy. The authenticity of the snapshot is hard to verify once the original source has disappeared, but its integrity should be easily verifiable via a checksum. The size of the snapshots could vary widely depending on the included media (an NYT article of mostly text would be a few kB at most, a YouTube video might be several orders of magnitude bigger), so storage may be a concern. The metadata itself would presumably be relatively lightweight, but again volume has to be taken into account. Depending on the intended uses beyond being a reliable reference for citations, geopolitics may be an important consideration in finding a suitable host (e.g. maintaining snapshots from politically problematic sources such as Wikileaks may be an issue).

Of course, nobody can predict random occurrences like car accidents, but barring accidents, I imagine it should be possible to, with a very good degree of accuracy, predict what the traffic is going to look like in the near future based on a couple of factors: time, day of the week, and how the traffic currently looks.

If nothing else, it'd be an interesting pattern analysis job to have the software begin to understand relationships such as ""At least 90% of the time, when traffic starts getting really backed up at the I-270 spur"", within 30 minutes the backup will spread several miles in either direction along I-495"", ""Traffic is usually really bad on Friday -- but if the Beltway is already backing up especially badly by 3pm (moreso than usual), then it's going to be essentially gridlocked by 5pm."""	t5_2rngx	True

I feel like I have a better concentration of thought when I'm handwriting things and I don't have the annoying clacking of keys for every letter and symbol I write down. Typing things on computer also just makes everything you write down aesthetically homogenized - whatever you write will be in the same font and print as everybody else.

How different/interesting/sometimes-annoying would it be if on a site like reddit everybody's posts were in OP's actual handwriting?

I guess what I""m envisioning is a kind of fusion of keyboard and mouse where you can navigate the screen and type with the same device, a flat pad you control with a pen. With a handwritten surface like that it would be much easier (for me at least) to edit whatever you're writing - instead of worrying about backspace or highlighting things to delete, you could just erase it with the pen on the pad.

Unfortunately, however their nifty zoom script widget works, middle-clicking on a nice big wallpaper to look at it at 100% in a new tab doesn't procure the full resolution but the smaller one... to get the full resolution, one has to click carefully twice, once on the cog and again on the first menu item, which quickly gets frustrating when trying to skim through and pull from hundreds of images.

The basic reddit bookmarklet is [here](http://www.reddit.com/bookmarklets/). It basically lets you quickly access the reddit thread for the website in question.

So, links to imgur automatically get redirected(?) to i.imgur, so while the link on reddit is imgur.com/vk0RV.jpg when you actually visit the site it becomes i.imgur.com/vk0RV.jpg. This messes up both socialite(FF Addon) and the reddit toolbar bookmarklet, since they look for the thread associated with i.imgur rather than the link it was actually submitted under. 

Now, the trick is that sometimes the original reddit link points directly to i.imgur, so you can't just blindly do a find/replace. It would need to check the i.imgur link and fall back to imgur.com if that doesn't produce an existing thread.

My current fix is to just use a second bookmarklet just for these situations, which does the blind find/replace:

    javascript:%20var%20h%20=%20window.location.href;%20h%20=%20'http://www.reddit.com/s/'%20+%20escape(h).replace(/i\./g, """");%20window.location%20=%20h;

1278025913.0	cl45m	[SMT] A 2.0 Website about book-like web page arrangements.		12	4	13	"In other words, a registered user creates an organized list of web pages that viewers should read in that particular order (and they should be able to rate the arrangements). It could work exactly like StumbleUpon, but step-by-step and not random, but organized:


* Learning programming languages and gaining skills can be easier.
* People can become more informed on any topic, for that matter.
* Browsing through web pages can now become like a book/manual.


Web pages with links all over the article can be heavily distracting to people who wish to become well-versed in a subject. The goal of this type of website is to host a repository of educational collections of websites arranged in order of simplicity and completeness (Chapter 1: Addition, all the way to Chapter 68: Calculus).


It is important that people vote on these entries so that good arrangements are filtered above bad arrangements. In addition, it is necessary that there is some sufficient categorization going on, filtering is important in education.


Make sure that people can easily make their own collections *based off of another's list.* It is crucial that people are fully able to continue to expand knowledge where someone else left off. Finally, all available lists should include discussion groups and a very easy reference to access derivatives of the lists.


I dunno, we could call them ""bookslices,"" or something, with how web slices kind of work. SO, in conclusion:

* Create a social network.
* The network is about book-like arrangements of websites.
* Arrangements work like StumbleUpon, except with Next/Previous links to a related concept/aspect/etcetera.
* Again, it should work like a book/manual.
* Derivatives should be easy to make and access.
* Discussions about each list should be easily accessible.
* Ratings of lists are categorized according to Tutelage and Quality.
* All lists are filtered by categories of fields of study.
* Accessible for blind/deaf/colorblind people, hopefully.
* Translations are pretty hard, defaulting on Google is (maybe) an option?

I print about 2-3 times a year, and it's rare that my need for the print-out is immediate - it's a hard-copy I want for peace of mind. An e-Ticket, a boarding pass, a contract or a copy of my electronic tax return.

What I want is the ability to send a file via web upload, email (or even better as a virtual printer driver) and for the print-out to be printed out remotely on a high-quality printer and be posted to me via a third-party. I'd be happy to pay a reasonable markup plus postage because this would compare favourably to me spending 40-50 times as much for a printer I rarely use. I'd have less clutter in my home, and the remote printer would probably be a high-end colour laser printer which would provide a print quality far better than any inkjet I'm likely to buy.

For anyone familiar with the old EA Pinball Construction Set (late 80's?), it allowed you to put a bumper, or paddle, or any of a range of pinball 'features' wherever you like; the physics/programming for the function of each was, of course tied to it, so you could create a new pinball table in minutes (I'd love to see a remake of this too!). 

My idea is a version of this for watches.  Let me:

* Import my own background/watch face
* choose between/design my own hands including what's illuminated - you'd just select the hands you want, place and size them, and presto, that part starts working.
* chronograph features galore - whatever exists should be makable - moon phases, stopwatches, lap timers - both digital and analog.

For an example of expressive music that can be made with a theremin: http://grooveshark.com/s/Chant+Du+M+nestrel/2DtQze?src=5

It would be awesome if someone could make one of these that worked with, say, an Apple trackpad. Note, importantly, that the input should not be associated with a cursor position, but rather with the position (on a trackpad or touchscreen) of the finger — so that jumps between notes and volume can be made, and because the cursor acceleration algorithms can render minute changes in position ineffective (or exaggerate non-minute changes).

For scale, I think it would be wise to experiment with mx+k, log(x), and tan(x) (-infinity to infinity in a finite space) based functions for mapping touch position to input value. Obviously there's a finite space and resolution on a trackpad, and musicians need pretty good precision, so that's probably going to be the hardest part of implementing this idea.

1291730332.0	ehne2	[SMT]  A plugin for uTorrent that automatically prioritizes certain file types.	omginternets	11	3	8	"**Why**

Usually torrents contain .nfo files, .txt files, or .html files that you have absolutely no desire to download.  These should automatically be set to the lowest download priority or set not to download at all.

Sometimes, depending on the type of file being downloaded, certain bundled files will be comparatively less important.  Details below.

**Use Case**

A more useful use case would involve downloading movies whose torrents contain preview files.  I would go out on a limb to say that most people don't want this, as they've already seen the preview pictures on the tracker.  It would be nice if the plugin, upon detecting a .avi or .mkv, would set all image files to the lowest priority and use regular expressions to parse file and directory names for strings that appear to contain previews.

**Other Details**

All of these settings should be customizable with a simple text configuration files (perhaps in a webform format so that people don't have to bother going into a directory and fixing a text file), and some of the more popular options should be customizable with graphical check boxes.  The idea is that you can edit the priorities to fit your downloading habits.

Context sensitivity would also be really cool.  For example, the plugin could parse the .torrent's name, and upon recognizing a popular release group (say, axxo), deduce that it is downloading a movie and apply movie-specific priorities.  In this case, .jpgs are set to the lowest priority, files and directories are parsed for previews and set to ""do not download"", and movie files are set to the highest priority.

**Ideas for Future Features (will be updated as ideas are submitted)**

- Parse for download type (movie, game, porn, etc...) and download to alternative directory.

Example: I download 9GB in one hour between 22:00 and 23:00 on November 15th. This means I can only download 1GB until 22:00 on Novemeber 16th, then the history will start to clear until at 23:00 those 9GB are completely cleared.

Trouble is, if you type something wrong and, say, miss a bracket, Google assumes you are trying to search for something. You need an internet connection to make use of this unit converting awesomeness. Also, it just seems wrong to be using a *search engine* to do this.

Ideally, I want to do this with PyLab. If there was a python library that could parse these expressions and convert them, it would be awesome.

1279513998.0	cr31i	[SMT] Code/XHTML/Whatever Generator/Package Installer based on a JSON Editor	ithkuil	9	2	6	"##Motivation

The idea is that there are a huge amount of JavaScript/JQuery/CSS/XHTML/PHP/Rails/Whatever components/scripts out there to do most things, from data entry, to Google maps, UI widgets or mini-applications, anything.  Those are mostly web development examples but this really isn't limited to web stuff.

It often seems to me as though the smartest way to build an application is to start by installing one or (usually a few) existing framework(s), more or less configure the different components, and tie the pieces together.  So the XHTML is often very structural, and PHP code may mainly be initializing a class or two with some parameters.  I am thinking for much of this we could use a tree to configure the parameters or structure and then generate the source.

Usually when you go in that direction (away from just a bunch of plain source files), instead of a tree, people end up with a completely visual drag and drop editor.  I think that can be very useful for a lot of things, and generally interactive graphical editors tailored to the domain (including spreadsheet-type things, visual equation editors, graphical schema designers, workflow designers, etc.) are ultimately probably the level that you would hope to be at, BUT --

Besides the fact that a lot of people just hate those types of graphical editors, there are a lot of practical issues with integrating different languages and frameworks into drag and drop/visual editors, and adding adequate keyboard support or certain types of composability are things that usually aren't even attempted.

##Idea

Here is one specific example of the system I envision in use.  This is going to be generating a standard CRUD application (I'm sure someone will try to assert that you can't extend the model beyond this area or level of complexity but we can argue that later if you want, assuming anyone reads this).  Suppose I was planning on building a simple web application using some MySQL tables with [ajaxCRUD](http://www.ajaxcrud.com/demo_createrelationship.php) and/or [Formitable](http://formitable.sourceforge.net/examples/simple.php) screens.

So this SMT system might look basically like the [JSON Editor here, click on goto treeview](http://www.linb.net/JSONEditor/) with possibly a few extra buttons.

When I start off the default tree might look like this:

    - installed [..]
      - 'core'
  
So to install Formitable I just add the node

    - installed [..]
      - 'core'
      - 'Formitable'
 
Adding that node triggers the automatic download and installation of that package.  One approach to that might just use something like a Google search and microformats [""rich snippets""](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/05/introducing-rich-snippets.html) to indicate package files (or vouchery) in markup.  Example, my web page markup microformat asserts package name=Formitable, two other people's say Formitable=my url.   As far as the triggering, this could start with some kind of [jsonpath](http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) in the tree that leads to a custom function or [JsonT](http://goessner.net/articles/jsont/) or something.

    - installed [..]
      - 'core'
      - 'Formitable'
  
    - 'Formitable'
      - 'connection' : null
      - 'table' : null
  
So you fill in the connection and table, etc.

    - installed [..]
      - 'core'
      - 'Formitable'
	  - 'mysql'
	    
	- mysql 
	  - name: 'mydb'
	  - user: 'blah'
	  - password: 'blah2'
	  - tables  
		- mydata
			- fields
				- id 
					- type: 'int autoincrement'
				- afield
					- type: 'varchar(100)'	
			- schematext (generated)
				'create table mydata (id int autoincrement, afield varchar(100))'
		
	- files 
		- testform.php
			- source
			  - ref : 'showtest'
			- text : (generated)
				 include(""Formitable.class.php""); 
				 $newForm = new Formitable( mysql_connect(""localhost"",""blah"",""blah2""),""mydb"",""mydata"" );
				 $newForm-&gt;printForm(); 
				  
    - 'Formitable'
	  - name : 'showtest'
      - connection : 'mydb'
      - table : 'mydata'
	  - normalizedField : null
	  - labelFields : null

	  
MySQL database schematext and testform.php text node are generated from the other nodes as you update the tree, and files are automatically uploaded to the server.

There could also be a mechanism to display some nodes as XHTML for help text on each field or parent node, or to include/insert template subtrees that can be merged in with a button click or something.

The point is you have a structured editor, and you are generating new nodes and code, so you can have extra nodes for help text or blank nodes so you can include all of the possible properties if you want rather than them having to look them up and typing them in.  Instead of copying and pasting from some snippet on the Formitable web site you just update the property nodes or copy and edit the template nodes and the code is generated for you.

The generation could use a special type of node with a JSONpath and then code to execute off of each matched node, or something.  So as you update the tree, each loaded module's paths are checked on that modified section of the tree, matching things are run that do transforms on tree, or run code for doing things like uploading files or updating table schemas or whatever.  There should ways (custom functions, transforms) to combine/compose output of lower nodes, so 'text' nodes on a file generated by each child are serialized into the parent 'text' node (for example).

1272844655.0	bz6wd	[SMT] A new type of structure/layering design for audio file metadata.	tonstergfx	10	2	5	"I apologize if the thread heading isn't too clear on what my idea is.

Basically, .mp3 audio files (I'll use .mp3 as an example) can be tagged with information regarding artist, song name, track number, cd cover, and so on. The tagging possibilities are quite extensive, but there's something about it that really bothers me. The way I organize my music is by keeping the ""artist"" field constant throughout an album, each individual track may have a featuring artist and this is represented in the song name by adding ""ft. [featuring artist]"". The reason I do this is because if I were to add the ""ft. [featuring artist]"" to the end of the Artist field, my music software will separate it from the rest.

My proposal which aims to counter this would be to have the option to give multiple tags for certain fields. Imagine how much easier it would be if you could tag one song with all the involved artists. This way, you could even search for each of these artists in the music software, and that particular song will show up on both occasions. The similar concept could also apply to the album name, because sometimes musicians will have the same song on different albums; this solves our issue of duplicates.

I really think that this is a good idea; I just have absolutely no idea how to go about doing something like this. To be honest, I’m not even sure it’s possible. Let me know what you think, Reddit.

**EDIT/UPDATE:** after doing a bit of research I found that multiple tagging is actually supported on certain tags. As far as I am aware, the Composer and Genre tags can both contain multiple tags which should be separated by a semicolon and space (genre1; genre2). As a result, if you were to look under Genre1 in your music player, you should find the songs tagged by that genre, and should you look under Genre2 you will find the same songs (given they were tagged properly). I’ve tested this with WMP only, so I’m not sure about the other players but it works with WMP.

I think this needs to be looked into because although Composer and Genre tags are already supported, who uses the Composer tag? If the Artist tag allowed multiple tags, then compilation albums, soundtracks, collaborations would be much easier to organize.

In detail: The spec is that you select folders to watch and the program sits dormant until there is a change in one of the folder's overall size (in bytes) and then compares the file names to a stored array and determines the new files that need adding to the external device. The user should be able to decide whether or not files should be replaced or stored with version numbers, which you can also select to auto-delete based on an n-x principle (only keep, say, 3 versions and the latest of a file).

1341446460.0	w1ybw	[SMT] FPS game based on playing with action figures	Salvius	6	1	5	"This was an idea I [posted on my blog](http://salvius23.blogspot.com/2005/11/video-game-proposal.html) years ago. I don't have the time/skills to do it, but I'd love to see someone take the idea and run with it. 

One-line pitch: An FPS based on kids playing with action figures.

In basic play style, this would be mostly a standard FPS - run through corridors blasting monsters, collecting power-ups, opening doors, etc. Visually, the design would be based around the concept that you are an action figure in a kid's game, and, as kids will do, he/they are making use of everything in their collection of toys.

So the environments may look like any kind of toy at all - a Star Wars-like playset, or playsets from any other toy genre for that matter (military, sci-fi, fantasy, etc.), or built from Lego bricks, or even made out of pieces of cardboard masking-taped together into rooms and corridors. Some levels may just take place on the floor and furniture of a kid's room.

Enemies would also be toys drawn from any style. Any moment you may find yourself facing bad-guy action figures, or rubber spiders, or perhaps the occasional Barbie doll (gigantic, in proportion to a standard action figure) or stuffed animal. Or even those rubber monster finger-puppets (complete with a visible finger emerging from the bottom and disappearing into the floor). Most of them should probably move in that peculiar bouncing puppet-gait children playing with toys always use for ""walking"". 

Other than the visual style, the concept allows for some other unique points. One ""power-up"" possibility would be for the player to be lifted up out of the level, getting a ""birds-eye"" view of the playing field. Certain enemies might have a special ability, when killed, to come back to life immediately by yelling ""Nuh-uh, you missed!"" Somewhere in there should probably be a ""Christmas"" level, in which a bunch of completely new enemies appear, sequentially, accompanied by obstacles of bows and wadded wrapping paper. I have no doubt other such ideas will emerge during development.

There are many file upload utilities that are part of websites, they work from the browser.  If you were to shut down your browser, or your computer, the upload would not pick up where it left off next time your turned your computer on.  Furthermore, those things are often specific to a particular website.

I want something generic.  Something that can upload to FTP or HTTP Post or Put.  Something on the users desktop that is essentially just an empty window that they can drag files or folders to, as many as they want, and those files WILL get to the desired server eventually, come hell or network outages, without further user intervention (aside from maybe restarting the app in the morning when they turn their computer on).

I want server sites to be able to offer a simple configuration file that a user of this app can download and drag into the app's window which would add a destination.  When they drag files to the app, they can set the destination (they could have multiple).  

It should work over SSL or https so that the data can be encrypted.

It should be easy to set the app up to ""watch"" a folder and then users can simply put files into the folder, and the rest is taken care of.  

If a file is uploaded that is in the wrong format or is just a bad file, the server should be able to indicate that when the file goes up, and the app would flag the file as having a problem for the user to deal with.

It should be able to zip multiple files together and submit them in one batch.

It should be able to throttle bandwidth use, because it should be able to handle 100's of gigabytes of data.

I work in bioinformatics.  Uploading lab data to databases is a pain in the ass for end users.  We end up having to go to their location and setting up FTP clients for them and training them how to zip files.  We also then have to upload data to NIH databases which is slow, error-prone, and time-consuming and requires a lot of user intervention to do.  It wastes a lot of time.

I can envisage people using Firefox as their standard Browser but preferring a Chrome based solution for running these applications.  The converse is also certainly possible as well.

In addition, Applicatons could have the ability to open in a window of specified size, or a maximised window, or a fullscreen undecorated window.  For some simple, things I think it would be nice to have a simple click-to start and esc to close option.   There are a number of behaviours that would be appropriate in different situations.  

So in summary,  JS+HTML is just like a runtime.  Someone can write a program in it.  I want to be able to click on it and run the program without downloading stuff and have it be just the program not a thing where I'm off to surf the web ( I have a web browser for that)

The game begins with a rectangular grid, made of square boxes.  All of the boxes are blank except for the upper left one.  The goal of the game is to reach the lower right corner.  
  
Here is how a move is made:  
In the upper left box, there are two arrows, one pointing down, and the other to the right.  The player may choose which direction to go.  When the player selects their arrow, their character moves one square in that direction and reveals the new arrows in that square.  
  
Obviously this game would have some traps to give it interest.  The simplest possible trap is two single arrows pointing at each other.  If a player realizes he is in a trap, he can respawn at the start point (possibly keeping the path he took revealed).  
  
The goal would be a game with the ability to make a grid arbitrarily large, with a certain number of paths to the exit, and certain difficult modifiers (time limit, respawn limit, no revealed squares kept...).  
  
edit: [here is an example maze](http://imgur.com/8Dtew).  The colored arrows show the correct path (there is only one) to the exit.  If you look at it in black and white, you can try to solve it yourself to get an idea for how difficult this type of maze can be."	t5_2rngx	True

I don't know much about electronics but at first I thought some kind of RFID tag would be good, but it appears the detectors are quite expensive if you want them to have the kind of range mentioned above.

However, if the tags used bluetooth then theoretically you could have an android / iphone app to track them instead of buying a dedicated tracker device.  I'm guessing this would also allow you to ""name"" the tags to make it easier to work out which one has disappeared.

Ideally the tag itself would be about pretty small so it could be easily attached to things.  Going by the size / price tag [of this usb bluetooth adapter](http://www.slashgear.com/smallest-bluetooth-adapter-yet-239836/) I'm guessing it wouldn't be too expensive to make some small bt tags.

I got thinking that it should be possible to have a background task which monitors disk IO operations and file opening habits and dynamically moves files I access a lot (or which are causing lots of IO) to my SSD and set up symbolic links to them, making the change in location totally seamless to other apps and the OS.

It'd basically act exactly like a huge hybrid SSD, but you'd be able to tailor your SSD:HDD requirements using individual drives rather than a combined unit (and without the cost).

This would be particularly great for apps like steam, where there's a shit ton of file data overall (your entire game library), but you only need fast access to a tiny subset of it (the game you are currently playing, or even just the maps &amp; assets).  Dynamically moving the game assets which are causing most disk IO to the SSD will speed up loading massively while keeping everything else on your mass storage drive.

Obviously the main technical challenge would be avoiding file access conflicts while moving files to &amp; from the SSD.  
I don't think such a challenge would be insurmountable though.

I envisage the app at its most basic level simply asking you to select: 

1. Which areas of your mass storage drive you'd like to monitor.
2. A working directory on the SSD where it'll move files which are being read a lot.
3. How much space on the SSD it's allowed to use.

The rest it'd handle dynamically.  

Advanced options would include being able to specify IO thresholds for when a file should be considered 'active', how long to keep files on the SSD before they should be considered 'inactive', etc.

This would cause all of the modules to emit a digital signal coded in sound waves.  The control module would then measure the distance to the remote modules and set up appropriate delays, so that the system as a whole would reinforce a unified cylindrical wavefront.  

This would produce the ""just right everywhere"" effect of the Bose PAS system and other line array speakers, but it does it without the compromises of a line array.  (Comb filtering, small drivers, all sorts of weird effects.)  With properly designed lightweight stands for the remotes, and wheels and a handle on the control module, setup could also be fast and easy, though not quite as fast the PAS.  "	t5_2rngx	True

What I would like:

1. ISBN uploading (or Amazon/Kindle, Barnes &amp; Noble/Nook, etc., importing)
2. User-votes for a variety of factors (similar to [BoardGameGeek](http://boardgamegeek.com), but for books) (plot, story elements, tags, genre, quality, entertainment value, POV, ...)
3. The ability to explicitly link a book to a suggested book, and for other users to rate the quality of that suggestion.

Thus, I can look up my favorite books and fill in data to help people find it, and provide suggested ""next books"" (such as the following book in a series, or a completely unrelated book which I think would be of interest to people who enjoyed this one). I can also examine the list of suggestions others have made, and give my opinions on the appropriateness of the suggestions for those which I've also read, or add any which catch my eye to my to-read list.

It might be nice if the site also provided book and e-book swapping tools. If I could **indicate which lendable e-books I own**, and which format they're in, I could then choose to **make that information visible** to 'friends' or perhaps everyone...then people could send me a lend request and I could send it off to strangers for a couple of weeks, and possibly make new online connections through shared reading experiences, but at the very least help save money on unnecessary e-book purchases while also providing an alternative to piracy."	t5_2rngx	True

1300889107.0	g9ph1	[SMT] I want an iPhone app that uses the accelerometer to track time under tension when lifting weights (r/fitness crosspost)	pwoolf	7	2	2	"Here is the idea. The intensity of a lifting session seems to depend on:

* the weight lifted
* the number of reps
* the time taken on each rep
* the spatial range of the lift

When people track their lifting, they generally focus on the weight and reps, but miss the time on the rep.

It seems one could easily use the accelerometer in an iPhone to track these values more accurately. I could see velcro'ing the phone to the barbell, then doing my regular exercise. I tell the phone what weight I'm lifting, and the phone counts my reps, and the time I take for each. It then logs the integral of my session.

The advantage is that if I'm doing, say, squats, I get a more accurate view of the total workout intensity that includes any variations in weight. For example, last Monday I did a warmup of 5x45 lb, then did 5x 135, then 3x5x275, then 2x10x225. I have no idea of the speed of these lifts. The app could take these values with the appropriate timings and give me a composite value that represents that workout intensity.

In addition, it would provide a great environment for logging lifts in general. A big advantage is that it would allow me to more objectively define progress.

I have a csv file with ~2000 items. (This would change to more items in the future)

If the item was not found it would beep or have the screen change color so we would know to put the item on the side to add into the computer POS.

Seems pretty simple? But I can't find something like this so far.

1324082528.0	nftjp	[SMT] A god game/simulation where you can mess with the physics of the universe and watch how it changes things, from a macro to micro level.	guyanonymous	7	3	5	"A god game where you can mess with the physics of the universe and watch how it changes things, from a macro to micro level.

Think of most of the Sim Games out there now. You create a physical world by placing items. You view it at many differenet levels (many end at the individual human level).  Most have some sort of disaster or calamity you can engage. Some, like SimCity let you designate zones and then you watch them as they fill up; others let you place individual buildings - the end result is the same - you manipulating physical objects.

What would the game be like, though, if instead of you placing physical objects, you changed the physics of the game universe?  I envision a spore-like game that was actually interesting and fun, but where you aren't necessarily controlling a character. Instead of controlling a character, you control the universe.  

You decide to increase gravity by changing the gravitational constant (or whatever it is called - it's been 20 years since I studied that stuff), and see a planet below you; you adjust the speed of time and watch the planet as the continents shift with time, ice ages come and go - all as they would with increased gravity.  Then you lower it, seeing again, as the centuries pass by in seconds, how your world would change from that point on with it's new gravity.

You could watch things at a more micro level; how would that amoeba/creature/humanoid evolve (or would they even survive) if we raised the temperature, or again changed gravity.

I'd love to take this even farther.  Depending on the computational ways of creating universes and their content, we'd want to set things up as a hierarchy.

Stars can have certain features and are affected most by certain physical forces etc.  When we view a star for the first time (selecting it), that star gets created.  Certain changes will occur as we change our universal constants etc, and we can watch those occur on our Star (there would have to be appropriate randomness within a range of plausible changes to keep it interesting).  

Planets require a star to orbit (or not, but let's keep it simple), so after that single star has been created, we have the choice of viewing individual planets.  Upon such a viewing of a planet, it is created in detail, and again, the game mechanics focus on physical changes in the planet based on your changes to the laws of physics.  The range of possibilities that can be created and how they might change should be based on mathmatics that vaguely and predictably produce believable results. If you increase the gravity applied to a planet - it's orbit would change in X manner, it's continents/oceans/climates would change in this manner, etc. At the same time this happens, only the most important of calculations at the planet's sun level would be made - enough that the changes are accurate in the long term, but not as accurate as necessary for the individual selection of the sun.

If we'd had an original Galaxy level of view, again, this would escalate up - or down to the continental level, or country level, or city level, or .... creature level.  A combination of Spore(but fun)/Simlife/SimAnt/SimZoo/SimTower/SimCity/SimPlanet/SimGalaxy/SimUniverse.  

I realize that this could entail a lot of data....but the amount would be dependent on you - there wouldn't be a switch - or a need - to make 'everything' visible... nor would there be a need to have 'unlocks'...people could spend as much time as they wanted looking at things in as much detail, and I suspect that those who really get into it and wanted 20 million individual people created with family trees going back 20000 years, wouldn't mind using one of the new 4TB drives to house a single save file ;)

This, coincidentally, I've just realized, relates to my desire to build a web site for creatives to create and share a universe's and to create a resource for fiction-writing in a fictional universe that, in theory, could tie together.  Creatives could share characters, environments, cultures - and create their own fiction building on each others' work and doing some gestaltian thing with the total being greater than the sum of its parts.

Anyway, I think I shouldn't have skipped two meals.  Time for food. Hope some of that made sense.

But there's this one tool, which should be so simple and so convenient for tons of people, that neither he nor I can find. And it's driving us both mad. Would it be possible for anyone here to be so extremely kind as to write it/modify some other FOSS app to do this?

Here's what it needs to do:

* Take .jpg images from more than one folder (preferably drag'n'drop from Shotwell, or import from Shotwell in some other fashion) and show them all as thumbnails

* Let you rearrange the images freely by dragging and dropping them from one place in the app to another. Regardless of timestamps or any other metadata

* Export the final result to a folder/directory as separate image files, or in some other way make it possible to show the images in fullscreen *in the same order as they where dragged and dropped to* on any Linux or Windows machine. The point is that the order should be correct, and that you should be able to choose the time intervals yourself. 

Here's what it needs to _not_ do:

* Not only show the photos in the order they where taken, as most other programs I've tried does (Shotwell, F-spot, gthumb, Gwenview)

* Not only export the resulting list of images and their order as a video/movie file, like PhotoFilmStrip and another one I found in the USC.

* Not only show the resulting slideshow within the app, like Picasa and MagicLantern. These two can do everything needed, except exporting for use on another machine. ML is also a bit too dificult to use in other aspects.

On click pop ups.   I hate when I go to highlight text and it spawns a pop up,  again I am against ad blockers as they tend to block all ads,  I don't want your pop ups,  but I'll view your inline advertisements without complain.

Websites that want to install chrome browser plugins should not simply drop down risking accidental clicks.   


Such things should be ""easy"" to ferret out heuristically since they access things that are pretty much useless otherwise.  I don't mind tab-pop ads,  but nothing I click that opens in a new window is ever useful (with one exception of my web based instant messenger I use,   but this problem can be averted by offering to allow specific instances of scripts with a drop down top bar)  

I realize it may not be simple,  but I feel many people would use this if the number of annoying scripts that it can find were relatively numerous.   There's tons of things out there that are useless and abused and have little use other that this.

1285859307.0	dl164	"A video game based on the arenas in ""The Hunger Games"" trilogy, which would be user/modder generated. **Spoiler Alert if you haven't read the books**"	jackerman09	6	2	9	"For anyone who's read ""The Hunger Games"" by Suzanne Collins, you know that the arenas are asking to have a video game modeled after them.  

**Spoilers Below**
For those of you who aren't familiar with the arena, it is a relatively small stretch of land, into which a set number of players are simultaneously released.  There is usually a source of weapons, food and other materials in the center (where a portion of the contestants usually meet a quick end), and then the rest of the arena could be anything from a lush forest to an arid desert, or a salt-water-based world where drinking water is scarce to a city block lined with booby-traps.  

The game would be about a mixture of surviving the other players, surviving the boobytraps/natural predators, and finding food and water to prevent your health from steadily draining.

I think the real appeal of the game would be that all but the most basic starter arenas would be user generated, with the only limitations of what you can do in the game as what the users can dream up.  This would obviously require an intuitive ""map-generator"" of some sort.

I know nothing about creating video games, so its possible that I'm completely missing the point and a game like this couldn't be made or wouldn't be practical, so if that's the case, someone please tell me, but otherwise, throw out any ideas you have!  I would love to be able to sit down and create an arena from scratch, knowing other people will be able to play and try to survive not only the other players, but the arena itself.

Also, if you haven't read the books (The Hunger Games, Catching Fire, Mockingjay), I highly recommend them.  They are quick, relatively easy reads, but still very enjoyable."	t5_2rngx	True

1273439979.0	c1v0k	"[SMT] ""What am I thinking of...?"" an online, open, community-driven Cha-Cha type service"	insulttogingery	6	2	3	"I realize that this has ""been done,"" but I'd like to come up with ways to do this better, or focus on a particular type of question.

Basically, I imagine this as a format for quickly answering a high volume of frivolous questions like, ""What's that song from that car commercial...?"" or ""Which LOST episode does Kate...?""

*But this is where I think it might differ from existing services, and where crowd-sourcing may be particularly beneficial:*

The purpose would be more to answer questions when a person can't quite remember or articulate something: a word or phrase, song or lyric, T.V. show or specific scene that's ""on the the tip of their tongue.""

Most questions asked of Cha-Cha boil down to ""google this for me."" This service would more rely on some member of the community making the connection from what would probably be an extremely vague description of something.

--------------------------------
This is the question that prompted me to make this SMT, and a good example of how this system could succeed where others might not:

&gt;""What Show and Episode is This From? I can't quite place this scene from a cartoon, which may be Family Guy but not necessarily:

&gt;At an arcade, a 'bad' kid is playing a light-gun/TimeCrisis type game too vigorously, and breaks the cable connecting the gun. He takes the now severed gun up to the employee at the ticket counter and says something ambiguous like 'Hey, looks at this!' wanting to get the game fixed. The clerk sees the gun and thinks that he's being robbed so he opens the register and gives the kid all the money and presses a panic button under the counter.""

I think this question illustrates why this particular type of service could be useful, and might go beyond just rehashing things that have already been done.

If I knew what the show was, it'd probably be fairly easy to just google
&gt;""Family Guy"" arcade game gun stick-up

(although even that query would probably give me results about Family Guy video games)

But, without that piece of information, it seems virtually impossible, whereas in a large community of question readers/answerers someone may just *know* the scene I'm talking about and be able to tell me.

For those unfamiliar with the new Peek feature of Windows 7, here's a little guide:

1. Start with no open windows.

2. Open reddit.

3. Open another application (your work, perhaps?) and maximize the window.

4. When you need a reddit break, mouseover the internet browser from the taskbar. A thumbnail preview of reddit appears.

5. Mouseover the thumbnail and your fullscreen project will hide itself, allowing you to read reddit. If someone comes by, a small movement of the mouse in any direction will put you back to your project. No suspicious alt+tabs, no Show Desktop to hide everything, no ""Boss Key"" shortcuts to remember... much safer, super convenient.

Here's my problem: this feature of Windows 7 doesn't let you scroll through your preview (for me, reddit articles). Obviously if you move your mouse to scroll the window, your fullscreen app comes back up.

So could anyone make a wee utility or browser add-on that lets users scroll thumbnail previews of Win 7 with their mouse wheel? I imagine when a user's cursor is over a thumbnail preview and the full window becomes visible, this utility would allow the user to scroll through the window by rolling the mouse wheel. If the previewed window has tabs (like an internet browser), users could ""tilt-click"" (is that the term now?) the mouse wheel left or right to switch to different tabs.

Why not just have all these African things fight each other?

So there would definitely have to be some size and strength adjustments. No matter how strong his *Paddle Kick* is, a fully grown Afrixalus frog is never going to take down even an elephant calf with his *Stomp* and *Trunk Slam* to counter. I'm not even sure how a Golden Cave catfish could be able to fight a chimpanzee, but in Pokemon they had a sea horse blowing bubbles at a mime so we have to have some suspension of disbelief here.

So that's it, we have thousands of these real life creatures in existence. Why not make them battle each other until they faint and have to be revived at the local Wildlife center? Players would learn about some new and unique animal species along the way. And make them fight.There would be poachers instead of Team Rocket.

**Problem:** when viewing links it's common to see many reposts. For those of us who have been on here for some time, we notice a trend that reposts occur every year or so. It becomes so bad sometimes that it's difficult to find new news.

**Solution:** As people browse reddit a userscript can check the links against a web API which will check its own database to see if the exact URL has been submitted before. If it hasn't then it will check what type of link it is. 

If it's an image then it will compare the submitted image to a set of hashes that it has gathered over the years. As it checks the image/webpage it will add the URL and image hash to the database or increment the submitted count.

If the submitted link is an article it can check text within the article, but this may be more difficult to accomplish than images and URLs. If it's possible, then an article can be hidden if the text has previously been submitted.

If any of these checks find that a link has been submitted before then the link will be hidden from view and a new link will be pushed in to the list on reddit.

Every post gets a code imgur style, with the raw code showing the details of the entry and the code followed by .js serving the javascript.

For instance here's an image I generated as a test of my image compression code for which imgur decided to allocate an ironic code.

File with extra details
http://i.imgur.com/BLoaT

Just the file
http://i.imgur.com/BLoaT.jpg

In addition to having javascript I would allow a small extension.  The first line of the code could have a series of tags to indicate dependencies.  

So you'd end up with a post like.

    #needs yLuh8,BLoaT,heJaL
    function $(id){return document.getElementById(id);}
    function html(id,h){$(id).innerHTML=h;}
    function css(id,s){$(id).style.cssText+=';'+s;}

The server would simply append all of the pieces together and serve them as a single static file (making sure it doesn't bring in the same thing twice)

so, Say the piece above had been allocated the id code BSIdw

  Jwaddle.com/BSIdw   would give you the details of the entry, who posted it, any descendants, ancestors,  A full list of the dependency tree etc. 

 Jwaddle.com/BSIdw.js  gets you the js with all of the dependencies prepended.
  
Posts would be permanent and immutable.  Once someone links to it they can rely on it being there forever.   Changing a piece of code that many things depend upon would require new posts of everything in the tree, that would be a relatively easy task to automate.  Ultimately it would change nothing at the webpage level until the page itself is updated to the new code.  This means things will only change when the page owner expects them to change.

At first glance that looks like a recipe for eating huge amounts of disk space and, well it is, but disks are huge these days.  If such a service were operating, for it to have acquired enough material to fill a 1TB drive it would have to be substantial enough that it would merit another drive.   

What does all of this give you?
A shared open repository of code, that you can use on the web, add your own bits to which people can use(or not) as they see fit.  You can change bits of code (it's like an itty-bitty git fork) let other people use those changes but changing things won't break anyone else's stuff.

Here's a solution.

Have a plugin that provides a virtual file system.  Javascript in the page can tell the plugin 'I have a file called ""xyz""' That file appears in a directory.  When the file is read the plugin calls a javascript function asking for the content of the file and delivers it to the reading program.

Doing things in this manner means that the only bits that could potentially trash your system are the bits that already have that ability.

To tell the truth I think I'd like an interface like this for all applications,  scripting, autosaves and all manner of other benefits would come out of having a file mapping of currently-being-edited files.

I think it's a neat idea to have a plugin that simply checks if a page has changed since the last time you visited.

1271299609.0	br2yt	SMT: Buoyancy-powered clock	name_censored_	4	1	3	"The concept is basically a sealed fluid-filled clear (perspex or glass) tube. In that tube is a widget, which has a buoyancy slightly below the buoyancy of the fluid (the difference must be precise, depending on the length of the tube!). The idea is that the widget falls at some pre-determined rate, and marks running down the tube indicate some length of time has passed. When the widget reaches the bottom, a magnet could switch on and compel the widget to the top of the tube, to start all over.

Alternatives and implementations;

 * The widget could be responsible for its own buoyancy and be powered by RFID or batteries
 * Helium is a particularly light gas, and sulphur hexafluoride is a particularly heavy one (thanks Mythbusters!); that makes them both good candidates.
 * There could be three adjacent tubes; one for hours, one for minutes, one for seconds. The trick would be getting the magnets not to interfere with each other
 * There could be a method for keeping the widget at the centre of the tube - perhaps magnets?
 * Multiple fluids of different buoyancies could be used (like layered jelly/jello) ; if the widget is responsible for its own buoyancy, then it would tend to prefer layer boundaries. This would make it ""jump"" rather than constantly progress towards the bottom. Also, it would probably only work for an ""hours""/""days""/""weeks""/etc tube.

As with most of my ideas, this has no particular practical purpose; it's merely something cool. Although if you worked out how to make this, you could probably sell them to hipsters and rubes^H^H^H^H *intelligent and sophisticated people* as a novelty at a handsome profit (this idea has a fairly high initial cost, in terms of effort, but a low-ish marginal cost).

1270777467.0	bof9y	An online community/information site for those involved in academia	EnderMB	7	6	5	"About two years ago I submitted this idea at my university in a business plan competition and achieved a merit prize (basically, I didn't win) after some great feedback for the idea but I still think that it has potential to become a viable project that people will want to use. The idea came from browsing Reddit and other online communities and seeing the small communities that collected lecture notes, videos of lectures and those that helped others with academic subjects (primarily Maths and Computer Science); it made me think that it would be excellent if there was one website where students and academics could freely post their ideas, lecture notes, links to lecture videos and share them with the world.

It sounds like a large-scale project, but if a community could be built around things like programming (see Stack Overflow) then why couldn't a multi-tiered Q&amp;A/forum community-based website handle academic subjects?

As an example, let's say I am a Computer Science student. I could set up an account and use the website as a place to host all of my lecture notes, making them available to everyone on the website. Communities would be set up for my specific subject at my university to allow conversation with other students, as well as generally for each subject. Over time a dedicated community would have generated a wealth of comments and posts about their classes, including links to helpful lectures, lecture notes for each class, etc.

That's when a hired academic can then take this information and build an index for the subject itself. For example, if over the space of a year a number of students had posted various lecture notes, links to lecture videos and answers to questions about their Software Engineering class the academic would then write a Wiki-type article that encapsulates all the information within that year, in time for students next year to read.

For those that have attended university and have worked hard for their grades they'll probably not like the idea of this website as it could potentially ""give you the answers"". I think that either way information should be free and even with websites like Stack Overflow and Math Overflow very few people can simply read through the site and learn how to program or be good at Math. Either way it'd be good to have somewhere to go when you need help, and especially good for those that cannot afford university as they'll know exactly what's being taught and where, allowing them to get all the required reading and information for free.

It'll be good to bounce this idea around and see if it's a fantasy that could never happen or a genuine site that could prosper for the greater good of those that want to learn. If the idea pleases the users here and people would want to help out I'd be more than willing to get the ball rolling as I have some basic programming ability (as much as a CS degree will give you)."	t5_2rngx	True
1270758437.0	bobqj	ProMouseus... Stealing the power of the command line and giving it to the mouse.	Lucretius	5	2	7	"This is how I envision it working:

1. The user double-RIGHT-clicks anywhere on the screen causing the ProMouseus window to appear. The window would be essentially three columns of buttons.  The ones on the left would be applications.  The ones on the right would be parameters.  The center column would contain a series of control-buttons such as ""close ProMouseus"", ""close ProMouseus and open file-manager"", ""clear last selection"", ""clear all application selections"", ""clear all parameter selections"", and ""clear all"".

2. The user selects one or more applications, and however many parameters he wants by clicking their icon/buttons.  The icons for these selected apps/parameters would float behind and below the mouse-cursor.  For example, he might select Open-Office-Writer, Notepad, Run-in-minimized-window, and Run-as-administrator.

3. The user would then close the ProMouseus window and double-click on one or more files on the desktop or his file-manager of choice.

4. Those file(s) would then be opened in those application(s) using those parameter(s).

Advantages:

1. This is a tools-based approach to opperating on a computer, not a file-association based one.  (A given file-type can only be associated with one application.  This can be a real pain if you regularly find yourself using more than 1-3 apps on the same sort of files).  

2. It grants a mouse-only interface something like the flexibility of a command-line interface.  

3. Lastly, it beats out classical launchers such as the windows button, quick-launch bar, or various dock-apps since it occupies no screen space when it is not being used regardless of the location of the mouse.  

Of course such an app would only be for a certain breed of power user.  I envision a number of options that would make it easier to use: Optionally, once an application was selected the ProMouseus window would automatically close (most people only want to open a file in one app at a time).  Optionally, once a application is selected, ProMouseus would apply a series of default options for that app.  Optionally, ProMouseus would allow only one app to be selected at a time.  Optionally, parameters that are only available for certain apps would only appear when that app is selected.

Use of ProMouseus would potentially be almost as fast as command-line with auto-complete: double-right-click, select-application-and-ProMouseus-auto-closes, double-right-click target file.  That's 3-5 clicks to open any file in any app (depending on how you want to count double clicking)!"	t5_2rngx	True

1270677451.0	bnugq	SMT: VHS data archiver	name_censored_	3	0	5	"The idea is to reclaim VHS tapes as a data storage medium; possibly as a backup. The scheme is fairly simple, you simply convert the data to an audio/video feed and send it through the graphics card 'video output' to the VCR; for example, you could use a grid of colours, where each node in the grid represents a data point. I'm also imagining header and trailer frame/s, to synchronise video and audio on playback/restore and to describe the format and variables. (Some other schema, developed by someone who knows more about VHS fidelity and volatility than me might be used, but the ""grid"" is easy one to comprehend so best for explanation). In this case, the following variables apply;

* Grid column count
* Grid row count
* Colour palette
* Frame/Refresh rate (grids/second)
* Audio palette
* Audio tone/refresh rate
* Stereophonic packing (store 2 audio streams; one in each stereo channel)

Ideally the audio track/s would be used as data check-summing/error correction, because then you don't HAVE to hook the audio in to get the data stream back (but you probably will for a degraded tape). Also, given enough computing horsepower, the computer might even be able to correct the distortion (eg, the neighbours of highly chromatic nodes can be coerced/calibrated to their original colour if the ghosting direction and magnitude are known). Perhaps a calibration/stress test cycle can be run on the tape beforehand (the tested/stressed portion of the tape can subsequently be replaced with non-payload frames, eg, header/trailer, including a low-volatility/high-redundancy 'stress test' report). 

Inserting numbers, here's the sorts of data you're looking at for a tape;

      64 rows, 64 columns, 24 FPS, 32 distinct colours + audio checksums;
    = 64 * 64 * 24 * 32 bps
    = 3,145,728 bps
    = 3,072 kb/s

3,072 kb/s on a 240 minute (short play) VHS tape is 44,236,800 KB, or 43,200 MB, or ~40GB. Which is pretty damn good for something that a lot of us have a whole cupboards' worth of. And apart from the economics, it's a nice ""geek cred"" project ;) 

As far as implementation goes, the following tools may be of interest

 * GNU/tar (tape archiver)
 * SVG picture format (for generating frames - SVG is XML-based, so can be generated fairly easily)
 * mplayer/mencoder/ffmpeg (for gluing the frames into a video stream)
 * sox (for audio generation)
 * rsync (for rolling checksums and interruptable copy/paste)
 * lirc (for IR-blasting the VCR, as opposed to relying on the user to mash buttons)

1270650778.0	bnnqk	A set of robots that play tag	tactics	3	0	1	"This one requires some robotics (something I wish I had the time and energy to nerd out to).

So you want a set of robots (or so). Each one has wheels, an LED indicator, a bumper that detects collisions, and a way of tracking the other robots.

One robot starts as ""it"". The it robot has to try and bump into other robots. The other robots must avoid bumping into the one whose it. The robot who's ""it"" is identified by a certain LED color (probably red) and the rest by another color (probably light blue).

The robot who's ""it"" must have a way to finding and following the other robots. I'm not sure of a good mechanism to do this. Either each robot needs to keep track of it's own position and communicate it via radio or each robot needs to have an ""eye"" (maybe tracking the LED color?). I'm open on this one.

When the robot who's ""it"" bumps into another, the other robot becomes the new ""it"". The LED lights change to show the exchange. The old ""it"" has immunity for a short duration (5 seconds?) If two robots are hit almost simultaneously, only one becomes it (although the other does NOT receive the immunity period and it's likely to be bumped immediately afterwards). The mechanism for communicating which robot hit which is left to the implementer.

Other ideas:

Bases. The play area is marked with one or more areas designated as bases. A robot occupying a base may not be tagged. However, it may still be bumped, which might possibly dislodging it from the base.

1270646175.0	bnmjp	a real GarageBand Site for Musicians and homemowners	drunkenMaster	4	1	3	"This is as good a place as any for me to post this idea. I have moved onto other things.

The idea I had was to make a site where homeowners with a garage or similar space could post its availability, location and price. 

Musicians looking for a space to practice could in turn contact the homeowners to ""rent"" the space.

Ad: ""I have a double garage with power that can be rented on sundays for $40.00 for 10 hours""

Musicians could search via proximity to find space to jam at a reasonable price, and homeowners could make a buck or two by giving up their garage space on weekends etc.

I wanted to do this when I lived in an apartment and couldn't play my acoustic drums. It was impossible to find space to jam...

Maybe someone else sees the vision for a site that is a mashup of a forum, a classifieds space, and a reddit voting system to create this site."	t5_2rngx	True
1376388322.0	1k9pwe	[SMT]: A cheap drone-killing quadcopter	sfacets	4	4	5	"With ever cheaper technology, governments such as the US are increasingly employing unmanned aerial vehicles to spy on and kill people. Drones have a [terrible collateral damage track record](http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/kids-killed-drones-us-pushes-back/story?id=19759808) and have been [used to spy on US citizens](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130619/10213023529/fbi-admits-to-using-drones-to-spy-americans.shtml). This trend of replacing manned aerial vehicles with unmanned semi-automatic ones will only continue to get worse.

The idea: develop a cheaply made quadcopter that can be set loose upon drones, taking them down. This could be done by having a separate detection system to 'paint' the target and send back the drones location in real time, so that the quadcopter/s can intercept and bring down the drone in some manner - perhaps an explosive/magnetic payload? Once the drone is destroyed/disabled the quadcopter can return to a re-charging station and await further instructions. 

If the production could be brought down enough, the quadcopters could form a network across the US (and later other countries) to protect its citizens from unauthorized/warrantless spying from their government.

So I post to this forum by selecting the location in my city (or any location in any other city) and sending in the question about the park. Previously people signed up to this forum and indicated they are willing to answer questions from their cell phones when on the go. (Just like random people answer questions on Reddit/StackOverflow/etc. for fun.) So when I send in my question the site relays it to the people in the vicinity of that location (it requires installing an app on their smartphones, so that the server knows who is near to that place). They receive the question about the location, answer it and the answers are posted at the forum, so anyone can read it. This way one could get realtime information from any location provided the forum gets traction and enough people registers to answer questions.

1361065634.0	18o3gf	[SMT] Share My Progress Website	ShareMyProgress	2	0	1	"Hi SMT,

I recently had a website design idea. I would like to create a website that allows users to upload pictures of various stages of lives and then my website would automatically create a slideshow/gif of these pictures with relevant timestamps. I.e For me it would be something like:

- 1994: Born (photo of mum at hospital holding me)

- 1995: First Birthday (Photo of me in front of my birthday cake)

- 2000: First sister born (Photo of my first sister)

- etc..

I'm not sure if this idea is too outlandish because I have no webcoding experience.

There are many other features that I would like but this is the basis of my idea.

Major Edit!: The website can have a separate page aimed at fitness enthusiasts who wish to show their progress pictures! It is a similar concept but will allow you to add notes, diets, workouts, weights and goals. With IMGUR and reddit compatibility, it creates like a mini profile that can saved as a jpeg or png and uploaded to either of those websites. Of course, includes Twitter and Facebook compatibility of some sort. 


Thanks in advance,

P.s sorry if I am not clear about anything. English is my second language

1360985536.0	18mby9	[SMT] an app that scans a product's barcode and links to video footage from the factory where it was made		13	15	24	"Like most people, I'm against things like child labor and sweatshop labor. However, if the products we're so familiar with like clothes or shoes were made with US wages or export labor that was not considered a sweatshop by US standards, most of us would not buy it because it would be significantly more expensive for what appears on the shelf to be the exact same product. 

But what if you could easily see where that product came from ? You might be willing to pay the extra amount if you saw that the cheaper one was made by a child or a worker earning $0.40 / hr (or a factory with anti-suicide netting in the stairwells). 

This could be extended to animal welfare. A lot more people would either go vegan or buy less meat if they saw how chickens / pigs etc are treated. But if you could turn to your app and see the more expensive eggs and see that they were from free-roaming chickens, it might implore you to to pay more for them.

obviously there would be issues with the veracity of the pictures/video, and it would require a ""critical mass"" of products in the catalog before it became useful. But eventually phony submissions could be debunked, and companies would then have to compete with each other to increase the conditions for their employees or animals (sadly I did not intend to create a parallel between the two).

Larger companies would hold out at first, smaller ""hipster-esque"" companies would be first to post videos of their factories. Then in order to quit losing business to competitors, larger companies would be compelled to change. "	t5_2rngx	True
