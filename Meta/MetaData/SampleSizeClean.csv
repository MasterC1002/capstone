But so many times I have clicked on a survey and started filling it out, only to get to a question - often near the end - about my ""school"" and how much I study - usually with no option to mention that I am no longer in school but working.  Sometimes these surveys have even included a full range of age brackets at the start (eg up to 65+), so you assume they're interested in a wide range of the population.

It's one thing to have a silly survey where the results don't really matter, but I cringe every time I see a survey for a school project.  

I write surveys for a living and I find that I'm always learning better ways to write my surveys.  It's a skill that definitely takes time to fully develop.  Here are some thoughts that this community might find helpful:  

- Sample: the sample here is not nationally representative.  Since most of the tools don't allow for qualifying the sample, please write surveys within this context.  Do add basic demographics so you can weight your data at the end if need be.  Do interpret the data within the context that this is very much self-select study meaning that your results are unlikely to be representative.  I ran a self-select consumer study and the scores were 20-30 points HIGHER than when I used a representative (technically still self-select) sample.  

- Questionnaire design: do write questionnaires like a story, or better yet a conversation.  Avoid confusing the respondent by switching your scales or jumping quickly from one topic to another.  Randomize when needed, but don't be over-zealous.  

- Question design: don't write unanswerable questions.  For example, ""To what extent do you like or dislike the Van Westendorp pricing exercise?""  Always give the respondent a ""Don't know"" option.  Unanswerable questions are a leading cause of questionnaire abandonment.  

- Question design: don't write double barreled questions: ""To what extent do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Access to abortion and birth control are a fundamental human right.""  I may have different opinions on both and not be able to answer the question.  

- Question design: don't write leading questions: ""Don't you agree that the evil Syrian government is committing flagrant human rights violations by murdering its own people?""  

There are probably a bunch more tips that I've run across but these are the ones that come to mind for now.  Good luck and happy data collecting!  "	t5_2tlqg	True

The responses slowed down, so I decided to process and post the results.

Here's what women chose:

*  [Straight women](http://i.imgur.com/BEQCwRC.png)
*  [Bisexual women](http://i.imgur.com/mrRHuug.png)
*  [Lesbian women](http://i.imgur.com/adJwVoY.png)
*  [Transwomen](http://i.imgur.com/wrC6xv1.png) (People in this group are also counted in the previous three)

Here's what men chose:

*  [Straight men](http://i.imgur.com/mZuC2bd.png)
*  [Bisexual men](http://i.imgur.com/W60zWns.png)
*  [Gay men](http://i.imgur.com/Jhbspjz.png)
*  [Transmen](http://i.imgur.com/CRjJ0FO.png) (Overlaps)

The most prominent result here is that every group mostly plays as their own gender.  This effect is strongest with transwomen (90% choosing female) and weakest with bisexual men (52% choosing male game characters).  What's also interesting is that every female group has a stronger preference than it's equivalent male group (e.g. of straight women 77.3% chose mostly female, while among straight men only 54.6% chose mostly male game characters).

And lastly, here's what [third/other gender people chose](http://i.imgur.com/Wp99ITZ.png).

Summary: for the most part, all groups of people want to play as their own gender, but people also want to play as female characters a bit more than they want to play as male characters.

1356471205.0	15fplm	RESULTS: On Long-Term Crushes	Juan_Montoya	74	6	12	"Not too long ago, I put out a survey on long-term crushes. I got 241 responses as of this writing. Here’s a deeper look at what I got.

---

##”How many times have you held a long-term crush?##

* **1-2 times:  132 respondents (55%)**
* 3-5 times: 74 respondents  (31%)
* 5-9 times: 20 respondents (8%)
* 10 or more: 6 respondents  (2%)
* 0 times: 6 respondents (2%)

---

##What is the longest you’ve ever held a crush for?##

* 4-6 months : 13 respondents (5%)
* 6-12 months: 22 respondents (9%)
* 1 year: 41 respondents (17%)
* **2 years: 55 respondents (23%)**
* 3 years:	 51 respondents (21%)
* 4-6 years: 31 respondents (13%)
* 6-10 years: 11 respondents (5%)
* Over 10 years: 9 respondents (4%)

---

##How strongly do you typically feel about your crushes? 1 is mild fascination, 5 is intense##

* 1: 3 respondents (1%)
* 2: 13 respondents (6%)
* 3: 81 respondents (35%)
* **4: 107 respondents (46%)**
* 5: 30 respondents (13%)

---

##How well do you typically know your crushes? 1 is barely, 5 is very strongly##

* 1: 13 respondents (5%)
* 2: 24 respondents (10%)
* 3: 60 respondents (26%)
* **4: 103 respondents (44%)**
* 5: 34 respondents (15%)

---

##If you ever told your crush(es) how you felt, what has been the typical result?##

* Relationship: 68 Respondents (35%)
* **Rejection, remained friends: 72 respondents (37%)**
* Rejection, remained friends but not as strong: 42 respondents (22%)
* Rejection, friendship over: 11 (6%)

After going through the results by hand, I tallied up relationship vs. non-relationship responses:

“Post-college” (22 and older):

9-11 record (45% success rate)

21 and under:

18-39 record (31.5% success rate)

And I do recognize that this is a flawed way of interpreting because older age means there’s a more chances to add one success story.

---

##Sorry, brah: Details on rejections##

* “Most awkward 3 years ever.”
* “The crush I didn't act on would have broken a family apart, and I thought she would be happier with another guy. She's unhappily single now, and I wonder if I made the right decision.”
* “**Guhbluh**. Just that what normally stops me from acting is ""oh, it's better if we're friends”.”
* “She was dating one of my friends, they broke up for a few months so I was her rebound I guess. I fell way too hard for her, but she ended getting back together with my friend. Haven't acted on my feelings since I respect and love them both too much to ruin friendships, especially if they are happy.”

And sometimes, even the rejection isn’t so bad...

* “We were never in the same place romantically for the same time.  He loved me; I wasn't ready.  I loved him; he'd moved on.  Back and forth for years.  I was married to someone else for almost two years before I realized I was finally over him, and it was the greatest feeling of freedom I've ever experienced.""

---

##And the successful side##

* “Told my middle school crush after six months; we've now been together for 5 years and are engaged!” (So frickin’ baller. –JM)
* ""One has resulted in the most fruitful relationship of my life.""
* ""For the girl in question, there've been a few occasions. The first ended with a friend breaking us up. The second, with me pulling back my confession in drunken idiocy, the third, with her getting into a relationship to spite me, and now the fourth. About three years all up, and we've both had relationships in between. But we did both have mutual feelings. Every time.""

---

##Smash Bros preferences:##

This was put together mostly to keep a tab on where I left off in checking on results, but the answers were fun to read. I won’t give you full numbers, but Link and Samus are popular. I’d guess Pikachu and Kirby would be third and fourth. One person picked Goku, and I want to play that game. Me? I totally rock it as Peach.

---

##Conclusion##

Judging by the numbers, it seems like the old bit of advice is right: just do it and see what happens. I’m going by the 72% of respondents who either found themselves in a relationship or came out of it not so terribly. And there were far fewer absolute worse situations where it ended in complete rejection. But a deeper interpretation shows me all the regret found in those who did nothing at all. And that’s why speaking up is generally the better approach.

1368325213.0	1e5vc8	[Results] Desired sex and sexual preferences, with graphs!	kabukistar	74	4	26	"Alright!  As promised, here are the results from my survey about the sex and sexuality people would desire to be.

###Demographics.

Of the 386 respondants, there were:

*  35 Bisexual/pansexual cisgender women.

*  99 Straight cisgender women.

*  9 lesbian cis women.

*  7 transgender (female-to-male) men of varying sexual preferences (mostly preferring men)

*  17 other-gendered female people of varying sexual preferences (mostly pan/bisexual).

*  4 transgender (male-to-female) women of varying sexual preferences (mostly pan/bisexual).

*  13 Bisexual/pansexual cisgender men

*  13 Homosexual cisgender men

*  163 straight cisgender men

*  2 male people with a third gender or prefer not to share their gender identity, both prefer women.

*  3 Cisgender men with ""Other"" sexuality

*  21 Cisgender women with ""Other"" sexuality


Among the 31 people who input ""Other"" as their sexual orientation:

*  7 were asexual

*  13 people expressed a slight preference in men or women

*  6 entered sexualities that were covered under the other options

*  3 had complicated preferences or were unsure.

*  1 person specifically liked to date trans people.

*  One person was attracted to animals.


###General Results

(Note that the sample size for the results section will be different from the demographics section, as some responses were not filled out according to directions, and discarded)

Among the general population, the average order of preference was:

1.  Straight male

2.  Straight female

3.  Pan/Bisexual female 

4.  Pan/Bisexual male

5.  Lesbian

6.  Homosexual male

[This chart shows the break-down of how people answered.](http://i.imgur.com/qZuK1VW.png)  Options which are more highly-populated towards the left of the chart are more highly preferred.  

Some interesting things to note are:

* Heterosexual male was far-and-away the number one choice.  Not a single person picked it as their last choice.

*  Homosexual male was far-and-away the least preferred.  More than half of the respondants ranked it last.

*  The top two choices were to be straight, the middle two were to be bi, and the bottom two were to be homosexual.

*  If people are going to be straight, they'd prefer to be male.  However, if they're going to be bi or gay, they would prefer to be female.  


### Bi/pansexual women

This, and the following catergories are grouping people by their gender identity.  IE, it includes transgender and cisgender bi/pansexual women. (So, anyone with gender identity ""female"" and sexual preference ""I don't have a strong preference"")  [Here is the chart](http://i.imgur.com/OQwLdFE.png).  The order of preference is:

1.  Bi/pansexual female 
2.  Straight female
3.   Bisexual male/lesbian female (tied)
5.   Straight male
6.   Homosexual male

Some interesting things to note:

*  **Very high** customer satisfaction with this product.  Over 70% of bi/pan women chose to remain just that, and none of them put it as their last or second-to-last choice.  

###Straight women

[Graph](http://i.imgur.com/xn1IW2b.png)

Order of preference:

1. Straight female 
2. Straight male
3. Bi/pansexual female
4. Lesbian or Bi/pansexual male (tie)
5. Homosexual male

###Bi/pansexual men

[Graph](http://i.imgur.com/DUG1UlF.png)

Order of preference:

1.  Straight male
2.  Bi/pansexual male 
3.  Bi/pansexual female
4.  Homosexual male
5.  Straight female
6.  Lesbian

### Gay men

[Graph](http://i.imgur.com/GRIwUJD.png)

1. Straight male
2.  Bi/pansexual male
3.  Gay male
4.  Straight female
5.  Bisexual female
6.  Lesbian

Interesting to note that gay men have the *lowest* customer satisfaction, ranking themselves as third.  They also have those most rigidly gendered preference order; all male options are ranked higher than all female options.  And within each sex, straight is ranked higher than bi, which is ranked higher than gay.

###Straight men

[Graph](http://i.imgur.com/BUg5FJk.png)

1. Straight male 
2. Bisexual Female
3. Straigiht female
4. Bisexual male
5. Lesbian
6. Homosexual male

###Third gender people

(Of all sexual orientations)

[Graph](http://i.imgur.com/qQuzpm7.png)

1.  Bisexual male
2.  Homosexual male
3.  Straight male
4.  Bisexual female
5.  Lesbian female
6.  Straight female

Very interesting results here.  While Straight Male is the top choice and Homosexual Male the bottom choice in the general set, third gender people are the only group to rank homosexual male above straight male (aside from trans men, below).  They also ranked homosexual male higher than any of the above groups.


###Transmen

(Of all sexual orientations)

[Graph](http://i.imgur.com/SJ0X1Ln.png)

1. Bisexual male
2. Homosexual male
3. Straight male
4. Bisexual female
5. straight female 
6. Lesbian

Much like homosexual male, trans men have a rigid preference to be male over being female (which shouldn't be surprising), and within each sex, they have a rigid rank order of preferences: they would prefer to be bisexual more than they would prefer to be attracted to men, which they would prefer more than being attracted to women.  


###Notes

Unfortunately, some groups (like lesbians and trans women) had too few respondents to get any kind of meaningful data from.

Below are the combined results, from which all trans-asterisks have been removed to avoid messing up the formatting. Unfortunately, the 10,000 character limit on self-posts means I can't post the text responses here; instead you can [read them on tumblr](http://smegandtheheads.tumblr.com/post/46802479530/here-at-last-are-the-results-of-my-survey-or-cis).

I feel positively towards them because they are transgender - 6%

My opinion of them is not influenced by their transgender status - 49%

I feel negatively towards them because they are transgender - 1%

A mixture - some make me feel positive/negative, others do not - 3%

It would not affect my attitude towards them - 73%

I would feel less positively towards them, but not enough to sever our acquaintance - 7%

I accept their preferred gender unconditionally - 63%

I do not accept it under any circumstances - 3%

**Please see the tumblr post for text responses.**


**Q7. If someone claimed to be neither a man nor a woman, despite having normative, unambiguous reproductive organs, would you accept that?**


(This is another question which should have been phrased better; as one respondent pointed out, gender categories can be seen as simultaneously both fictional and legitimate.)


No. You must always be one or the other - 10%

No, I'm just not interested - 24%

No, I am adverse to the idea - 1%


**Q12. If someone who was born male now lives as a woman and has undergone SRS, which statement best describes your thoughts about who they are?**

(These two questions measure different degrees of acceptance, as well as the discrepancy between cis people's perception of trans people and their actions towards them. Q12 mentions trans women and Q13 trans men mostly to avoid erasing either group, as failing to specify would have caused too much ambiguity.)


They are a woman, just like any other woman - 56%

They are a type of woman, different from those who were born female - 37%

They are really a man - 3%

They are neither (fully) a woman nor (fully) a man - 3%


**Q13. If someone who was born female now lives as a man and has undergone SRS, how would you treat them?**

(Several respondents clarified that they would only hold back from treating a trans person like a cis person when it was strictly relevant, e.g. not asking a trans woman about her periods.)

I would treat them completely like a man - 68%

I would treat them like a man up to a point, but allow for the fact that they were not born male -26%

I would treat them like a woman - 1%

I would treat them uniquely, as neither a (normal) man nor a (normal) woman - 4%


**Q14. How do you feel about educating children and teenagers about transgender issues?**

(The ""don't know/care"" option was only introduced in the second iteration of the survey, meaning it was not available to the first 150 respondents.)


They already receive the right amount of education on the subject - 5%

They receive too much education on the subject - 2%

There needs to be more education on the subject, prioritising teenagers - 53%

There needs to be more education on the subject, prioritising younger children - 28%

I don't know/have an opinion - 11%


**Q15. Have you ever considered whether you yourself might be transgender?**


I have considered it seriously - 6%

I have considered it idly - 32%

I have never considered it - 60%

I have previously identified as transgender/gender variant in some way - &lt;1% [one person]


**Q16. If your (hypothetical) young child claimed to be transgender, would you know how to react?**


Yes, I already know about raising gender variant children - 8%

Not immediately, but I'd know where to start - 51%

No, I'd be completely at a loss - 14%

They're just masculine women and feminine men who want to conform to gender stereotypes - 4%

None of these are true - 63%

My knowledge is too limited to make these judgements - 7%


**Q18. How do you feel about trangender people in the media? Check any that are true.**

There aren't enough transgender people in the press, on TV and radio - 53%

Portrayals of transgender people, issues and identities are too repetitive - 33%

Portrayals are sometimes too sympathetic - 8%

I'm here to ask anyone who has a spare 20-30 minutes to fill out my questionnaire here: [1] http://129.215.112.84/ . I'm looking to get at least 100 participants and there's no way I can achieve that without the help of you guys.

If you are able to help me, *please* don't rush through and answer questions randomly, it won't help me at all and I will just delete your data, and it will only waste both of our times.

If you might be interested, here is some information about it: The study is looking at how people's music preferences relates to their personality. There have been a lot of study's on this in the past, but they always ask people ""what genre's of music do you like"", which is overgeneralizing. I'm aiming to use actual music clips, rated on a bunch of qualities like distortion, sadness, romanticism, percussion, etc... to find out more specific relationships between the big 5 personality factors, and these specific musical characteristics. For more information, PM me if you need to ask additional questions.

Thank you to anyone and everyone who can help, it really has a big impact on the legitimacy of my results for even an extra 10 people. Thank you!

I'm currently a medical student at the University of British Columbia. As part of some research I'm doing, I designed two short online quizzes (20-25 minutes) to gather data on either facial identity recognition or facial expression recognition. I need a number of participants to do this quiz, hopefully from a diverse group of people from a variety of backgrounds, ethniticities, etc.

It would help my research greatly if you could take the time to do one or both of the quizzes. If you don’t have the time, it would be great if you could leave an upvote so I can get more exposure for this post. This is a throwaway account so I don't get any karma for this!

1374011409.0	1ifyah	[Results] Cats vs Dogs	kabukistar	62	3	6	"I did a survey a couple of days ago asking people to rate how they felt about cats and dogs, from 1 (hating them) to 5 (loving them) and also to predict what they thought the average Redditor would think of these animals.  Here are the results.

First, [here's a graph showing what each respondant thought of cats and dogs](http://i.imgur.com/ilYo03s.png).  As you can see, people were generally pretty positive towards both animals.  Only a handful (6 each) said that they hated cats or dogs.  Cats got slightly more 2's and 3's and dogs got a few more 4's and 5's which gives dogs a higher average rating.


[Here's a graph](http://i.imgur.com/TOaAS5K.png) showing what people *thought* the average Redditor would rate cats and dogs.  A few people thought that Reddit would rank dogs as 1 (hated) or 2.  And significantly more people thought that cats would be rated as 5 than dogs.  Overall, people thought Reddit would like cats more than dogs, and with a more significant difference in means than with the chart above.

[This last graph](http://i.imgur.com/0WMt2uY.png) is a little confusing, but the outer circle shows the breakdown of how many people liked cats more than dogs, liked dogs more than cats, or liked them both the same.  The inner circle shows how many people thought Reddit would like cats more than dogs, like dogs more than cats, or like them both the same.  As you can see, very few people thought Reddit would like dogs more than cats, the plurality instead believing that Reddit would like them both the same.  Interestingly, slightly more people chose that they like cats more than dogs than the opposite (by a difference of 2).  This goes against the mean differences in chart 1 above, showing that people who like dogs more tend to put a larger gap between their opinion of dogs and of cats.


Summary:  On average, Redditors like dogs slightly more than cats and believe that Reddit likes cats more than dogs.  Cat-lovers tend to score cats and dogs relatively close to eachother, while dog-lovers tend to score them further apart.  And generally, people like both animals.

since most are not professional researchers or experienced survey writers, is it worth putting together a thread and link in sidebar as a useful guide for making surveys more effective?

the kind of things i'd like to see addressed are:

1. questions being optional
2. when to use input fields vs check boxes
3. simplifying questions and making surveys shorter
4. using non-leading, non-biased questions and statements
5. providing an accurate participation time (5 minute survey, etc)

there's probably other stuff that i've overlooked.

perhaps we could also:

1. remind people not to post surveys at the last second (zomg this is due today plz help!), and 
2. encourage people to discuss their research in their post (to help with receiving better feedback)

those are just some ideas. i hope that we can maybe improve the quality of people's surveys and (ultimately) the quality of their results.

So please, if you plan on participating again, read through this post in it's entirety. Thank you!

Alright, so let's start off with some stats on you guys. Within 24 hours of posting the survey **over 900** entries were made. That's pretty amazing. So again, thank you all who contributed.

Let's move on to the actual data. First, let's start with a couple graphs of everything.

[Chart 1](http://i.imgur.com/GxYz5Iq.png)

[Chart 2](http://i.imgur.com/Qfhpb1p.png)

Not surprising, the most chosen number was 42, followed by 69. This was pretty much expected, and also skews the data, so from this point forward, let's disregard those two numbers.

In the beginning, I had hypothesized that the ""most random"" numbers would have three qualities:

* They would be odd.
* They would be prime.
* They would be surrounding the 1st and 3rd quartile (around the numbers 25 and 75)

I also made hypotheses on the ""least random"" numbers:

* They would have many prime factors.
* They would include multiples of 5.
* They would surround the upper and lower bounds.

In first place, we have 72 and 37, then 87 to follow them up. The 72 was a bit shocking to me. First of all, it's even, which doesn't follow 2 out of the 3 hypotheses. Here's my explanation for this number: it is a multiple of 3, it hovers around the third quartile, and it includes the number 7. That last part is probably the most prevalent; numbers with the digit made up a significant chunk of all numbers chosen, almost 40%. In fact, you have to go down the list to 12th place to find a number without one (way to go number 22!).

[Chart 3](http://i.imgur.com/eRrxfwP.png)

From the data, it can also be shown that prime numbers have little to do with the guessing of ""random numbers"" as shown by this chart.

[Chart 4](http://i.imgur.com/NqkqkLZ.png)

A measly 31%. There are 25 prime numbers between 1 and 100, so you would expect 25%, but considering the influence of the number 7, and it's appearance in the primes, the small jump can be attributed to the magical number.

Next up to test was the quartile theory. Here it is.

[Chart 5](http://i.imgur.com/wp2d7Fv.png)

The verdict: no correlation. Each group has 17 numbers, and the groups scored 16% for the first quartile, and 23% for the third. That third quartile may seem to be bumped up, but it includes all of the 70s. The inclusion of the number 7 was likely the main causation for any increase in score. 

To conclude the ""most random"" numbers, many people attribute the number 7 as random. This holds true also for the ""Pick a number 1-10"" question. 

Now let's look at the ""least random."" Multiples of 5 all got a couple votes here and there. Expected. Here's some things that were unexpected:

* Numbers with the digit 1 in the one's place received few votes
* Squared numbers received few votes
* Multiples of 11 received a large amount of votes, even 55 (a multiple of 5)

I would love to keep on analyzing this data, it really is fascinating, and I'm sure there's more to discover, but I need to move on. I do need your help for one more thing though. At the beginning I asked you to read this and to fill out a follow up survey. Here it is:

**Using the knowledge you, the participant, have absorbed through this analysis, make an educated attempt (as a society) to be truly random. That is, attempt to create a relatively even distribution.**

***IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU DO NOT CONVERSE WITH EACH OTHER ON WHAT YOU ARE VOTING ON HERE. THIS IS AN EXPERIMENT ON YOUR ABILITY TO INDIVIDUALLY CREATE RANDOM DATA***

[Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1GZkL0nBHbTO08pY4hVbzYJjBBTWYZlpzFro50_8UZi8/viewform)

As of 6 PM (PST) I've decided to conclude the survey for: 'Are you an introverted or extroverted individual?'
You can still take the survey, but I won't post the results for new answers I receive. 
A total of **398** people took the survey, but **24** participants checked both boxes and were thus excluded from the data.
So, of the people who were included in the survey, **310** individuals considered themselves as being introverted, and **63** people considered themselves as being extroverted.

Introverts: **83%** 
Extroverts: **17%**  

Being that this is reddit, I'm not surprised by the results. Yay to the introvert horde!!! :)

Thank you to everyone who participated!

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Communication at University of Illinois at Chicago. I teach, research, and write about new media and gaming. I’ve also been a member of Reddit for a year or so, and a lurker for a couple of years before that.

I’m currently working on a research project about Reddit, and I’d like your help. My project is focused on Reddit as a participatory culture platform and how it creates a sense of community among its members. Specifically, I’m interested in talking with you about your personal experiences on the site – what you think about Reddit in general, what you like/dislike about it, how you view others on the site, etc.

A couple of notes (IRB/legal stuff):

* This is a research study being conducted by the Department of Communication at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
* You are eligible to participate if you are over the age of 18 and have a Reddit account.
* Eligible participants will be interviewed using Reddit’s direct messaging feature.
* Interviews should take about an hour (total) of your time and will be relatively informal. I have some topics I’d like to cover, but I’m really interested in your personal experiences with the site.
* Your identity will remain anonymous. You will have the opportunity to provide me with a pseudonym in place of your Reddit username that I will use for any public dissemination of material.
* Participation in this study is entirely voluntary. You may choose to end your participation at any time or refuse to answer any questions I ask.
* This research has been approved by my university’s Institutional Review Board under the title “Understanding Participatory Culture and Engagement on Reddit.com,” IRB protocol.

While there is no direct benefit for participating, I will share my findings with the Reddit community as a whole after my research is complete. It seems that one of the favorite topics on Reddit is Reddit, so I’m hoping you will find all of this somewhat interesting, whether you choose to participate or not.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have via my Reddit account (/u/nrrdgrrl4500). And, please feel free to pass on this information to others who might be interested in participating, but aren't subscribed to this sub.

Thank you in advance!

tl;dr: UIC researcher wants to hear about your experience with Reddit. Contact her at /u/nrrdgrrl4500 for details.

I can also post a link to a spreadsheets with all the responses, but I don't know if this an OK thing to do.

**Some findings**

Disclaimer, I have no background in surveys or stats, but I tried my best :)

The results were pretty interesting, and we can see some clear differences between men and women. I collected some more population data (country and age) but it was harder to find correlations, especially since only a few categories are highly represented. Looking at gender differences was the most obvious thing to do. I can share the data if anyone else wants to analyze it.

**Do you enjoy shopping for clothes?** **Do you enjoy choosing what to wear every day?**

Women who responded enjoy shopping for clothes more than men do (average of 3.4 versus 2.6 on a scale from 1 to 5).

41% of people who responded prefer shopping for clothes than choosing and outfit, 38% like both equally, and 21% prefer choosing an outfit over shopping for clothes. 53% of women who responded prefer shopping for clothes, but only 27% of men.

*Do you enjoy shopping for clothes?* (On a scale from 1 (hate it) to 5 (love it))

* Average: 3 (stdev: 1.2)
* Men: 2.6 (stdev: 1.2)
* Women: 3.4 (stdev 1.1)

Several people mentioned in the additional comments that they hate shopping because the sizes are non standard, and according to one person, are ""an absolute clusterfuck"".

*Do you enjoy choosing what to wear every day?* (On a scale from 1 (hate it) to 5 (love it))

* Average: 2.8 (stdev 1.0)
* Men: 2.7 (stdev: 1.0)
* Women: 2.9 (stdev 1.0)

**How much time do you spend choosing what to wear on a normal day?**

Overall, the vast majority (91%) of respondents spend less than 10 minutes choosing what to wear (60% of total spend less than 5 minutes, another 31% spend between 5 and 10 minutes).

This value goes up to 97% that spend less than 10 minutes for men, and the vast majority spends less than 5 minutes (77% of total).

Among women, 85% spend less than 5 minutes, but 40% of the total spend between 5 and 10 minutes.

**What are your main concerns when choosing what to wear?**

The responses here were pretty diverse.

Top 3 concerns were: 

1. Wearing clothes that you like (83%)
2. Wearing comfortable clothes (80%)
3. Wearing clothes that match the weather (62%)

Bottom 3 concerns:

1. Appearing younger than you are (1%)
2. Following the latest trend (3%)
3. Appearing older than you are (5%)

I was surprised that ""Following the latest trend"" got so few votes. If you believe the media (but maybe I should stop doing that), fashion is a big thing.

**How many days to you wear...**

*Shirt, T-shirt, top...* Half of the respondents (51%) wear them one day, but another third (32%) wear them two days, and 14% for for 3-4 days.

*Sweater, hoodie, jacket...* Opinions are spread pretty evenly between 3-4 days (18%), a week (25%), a couple of weeks (29%) and a month or more (20%).

*Jeans, pants...* Responses were spread too. 3-4 days (27%) and a week (28%) gathered the most votes but only account for 55% of the responses.

*Underwear* There's a clear consensus on wearing them 1 day (86%). An additional 9% think 2 days is ok. That leaves 5% that wear them for longer than that.

In the additional comments, some people reported that the frequency with which they would wash their clothes also depended on:

* materials 
* what you were doing the day you were wearing them 
* if you've worn them the whole day or part of the day
* if they smell


**Do you think it's acceptable to wear the same outfit two days in a row? (not including underwear)**

The opinion is extremely divided. 52% of respondents think it's acceptable (yes: 14% of total, mostly yes: 38% of total), and the remaining 48% think that it's not (mostly no: 41% of total, no: 7% of total).

Men who responded were more in favor (60% yes or mostly yes) than women were (45% yes or mostly yes).

Overall, there are a bit more categorical ""yes"" (14% of total) than categorical ""no"" (7%), so I think I'm going to keep doing that :)

**Additional comments**

To conclude, my favorite comments:

 *""If I could afford to hire a personal stylist to shop for my clothes and pick my outfit each morning, I would.""*

*""I envy the times when you went to a tailor to get a few outfits and wear those all the time and it was completely acceptable. Fuck fast fashion.""*

##”Why would you want to live in these worlds? And why would you not want to live there?”##

One of the common reasons for wanting to avoid these places is the danger inherent with having a world exciting enough to write an adventurous story about them. But on the other hand, the adventure and excitement was also one of the main draws. Some would only want to live in these worlds if they were one of the exceptional heroic types, especially with special powers and abilities that they currently don’t have. There didn’t seem to be an agreement as to whether the average person would be better off now or in most of these fictional worlds. 

One person gave this interesting answer: 

“I chose the ones that I was familiar with, because I could imagine myself getting along. Like, in a fallout style situation, I already know how to kill mutants, or in Star Wars I would already understand the basic concepts of how things worked. I would not want to be somewhere that I didn't understand.”

---

##Concluding comments##

When I thought up this survey, I expected the enthusiasm of science fiction/fantasy fans to translate to a strong desire to live out the stories they love so much. I’m simultaneously surprised and not that so many of them thought out the question in a very rational way and took the danger levels and quality of life for the lower or middle classes into consideration. Overall, the votes were more “yes” than “no”, but without as strong of a vote of confidence as I would have imagined.

So, hopefully some of you remember when I asked you guys to fill out a [survey]( http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/rattn/did_a_survey_in_rsex_now_i_want_to_see_how_a_more/) about sex, as an answer to a survey that was filled out in r/sex. I fell asleep 3 hours after putting the thread up with 110 responses, thinking “Hey, that’s not bad” and woke up to over 600. By the end of the two day run on the first two or three pages of AskReddit, I had just under 1000 responses. So, for that, I thank you AskReddit. I will describe the questions I asked and the results I have as well as some of the anomalies I witnessed in the data. Before anything though, you can go [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmB6E2D1lngXdGlqZUhSLTM5ZmlnS1NkVGhxMWpfN0E) to see the data in its pure form, as well as the statistical tests I created. If you like statistics and want to see the attained significance levels (P-values) for all the tests, or want to create your own tests, have fun with that. Let me know how it goes! I will add some of the basic statistics at the end of this post.

First, what I used: I used Excel 2010 with ToolPak to conduct statistical tests, and double checked the figures in RStudio for the close tests (I would have used Rstudio for the whole thing, except I didn’t want to spend a lot of time getting the data ready to be analyzed correctly in Rstudio, and Excel allows the data to be a less standard (Not really, it’s just easier to get around!). All tests are given to the .05 significance level. Of the ~1000 entries, I got rid of the big outliers at the top end of the frequency spectrum (I found that the top 2% had a nice round cut off of 14 times per week, so that’s the point I used). I assumed normality, so used parametric tests (Which is true for the means due to the central limit theorem, and that is the statistic for most things). There is a bias against the general population, because you have to understand that the only people who answered are the type of people who are on reddit. So, while all the hypothesis tests are testing for population means and linear relationships of the model, the population would be that of reddit users. 

**Questions**

Does sex drive go down with age? **No. In fact, of the sampled answers, the opposite is true. There is a positive linear relationship between age and ideal sex frequency per week.**

Is there a relationship between age and kinkiness? **No. Kinkiness has a near-uniform distribution over all responses.**

Does shacking up result in less sex drive? **No. While the sample means showed a relatively large gap (5.539 ideal sex per week for living together, 5.877 ideal sex per week of not living with someone), the errors were large enough that it was not statistically significant.**

Do males want more sex than females? **No. The mean for male ideal sex frequency per week was 5.817, and for females was 5.803. That combined with a small standard deviation and large sample size just blew this hypothesis out of the water.**

Is there a linear relationship between self-image and self-confidence? **Yes. A Pearson’s coefficient of 0.667 indicates a moderately strong positive linear relationship between the two values.**

Does your self-image wane with age? **There is not enough statistical data to indicate this. I do not think there is no negative linear relationship between the two, but it’s skewed by a lot of young people’s lack of self-image. I feel if I had a sample size of 10,000 or 100,000 that focused on this I could definitely find that relationship, but with this sort of sample, there is not enough data to support this hypothesis.**

Do you want more sex when you’re single than when you’re not? **Surprisingly, no! At the .05 significance level, single people actually want LESS sex on average. The sample means were 5.442 ideal sex frequency per week for single people, and 6.086 for people who aren’t single.** 

What about virgins? **Once again, a surprise: Virgins want less sex than non-virgins by a WIDER margin than singles versus non-singles. The P-value for this test is &lt;.0001. The sample means were 6.105 for non-virgins, and 4.617 for virgins.**

Now, for some of the weirder facsimiles I noticed about the data, without conducting any tests. 

1. The number of homosexuals was surprisingly low. Only 30 in the 1000 responses, or 3% of the sample, were homosexuals. This is well below the world-wide average numbers that you see, and I would think Reddit, being so socially liberal on average, would have more than that. 

2. Not as surprising, but the 16-24 demographic was HUGE compared to all other demographics. We’re talking 774 individuals between those ages. And even if you narrow it down, over 100 responders were 18, 19, 20, and 21 each. 

3. The youngest responders were 14, and the oldest were 52.

4. Of the six possible choices for relationship status, the lowest represented by far was engaged. Not at all surprising, but what was surprising was that married people had an unreasonably low representation of ~7% of the sample. 

5. The youngest age at which people lost their virginities was 12, and we had four responders with that response. Two of these responders were homosexual, and one of them was bisexual. Maybe it’s a coincidence, but maybe for these boys (the three of them are all male), sword fighting was one of their favorite things to do as a child for a reason!

6. The oldest virgin we had was a 32 year old asexual. The oldest non-asexual virgin we had was a 29 year old male who, not surprisingly, had very low self-confidence. 

I’m gonna stop myself here. I love statistics, so I could spend weeks just looking at the data and finding fun things about it, and keeping on running tests. If you have any questions you want answered about the data that I didn’t and don’t really get how to find the answer, let me know and I’ll be more than happy to oblige.

1363964743.0	1asvfb	Results of my experiment into beards and fertility!	lya500	43	4	6	"First of all I just want to give a million thanks to everyone who participated in this weird research. It's been a pain in the arse but a lot of fun to conduct and we got a great number of responses.

Having said that, as you will see, a great portion of those had to be eliminated. This does not mean your time was entirely wasted, as we performed ALL SORTS of analyses before excluding any data points, but alas no significant effects were found.

Our hypothesis from evolutionary theory was that women who are at their most fertile stage in the menstrual cycle will have a preference for beards as it represents masculinity and good genetics, but will prefer the more gentle looking unbearded faces when at low fertility stages as they want a caring figure to look after them. There are a ton of experiments to show that this works with [facial structure](https://dspace.stir.ac.uk/bitstream/1893/832/1/Little_mascprefs_realfaces_revise_final3_proofsrevisions.pdf), [tone of voice](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0018506X05001704), [body shape](https://dspace.stir.ac.uk/bitstream/1893/852/1/Little_bodyprefs_revise_final_2nd.pdf) and even [smell](http://intl-rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/1/3/256.full).

Sadly, this was completely untrue for beards. Ridiculously untrue. It wasn't even trying to be true. We were crushed.

But all was not lost. Although fertility was not a factor (in anything. Like, it had no effect on a single other factor) we did find one interesting significant effect. It seems that women already in a relationship are far more likely to show a preference for bearded faces when they are asked to consider their judgements in the context of a short-term relationship. Essentially this means that they already have a guy at home who is willing to look after them, so are more likely to go out and seek masculine guys to procreate with for those strong genes, and then return to their caring boyfriend who will help them raise a baby. This is the theory anyway, as outlined in most of those other reference papers. And our results support it. Which is kind of cool.

Anyway, you can read the more formal version of our findings [here](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8szH4y9iesGWnp6RDdvUk04bEU/edit?usp=sharing) if you're interested.

If you're going to look through the data, I highly recommend you use a pdf viewer that uses bookmarks.  The ANOVA sections (and I guess frequency tables, too) are the most interesting since they look for differences between different groups, which is the main thing I was analyzing.

The actual project I did was a shorter powerpoint, although I spent about half of it on cluster analysis, which didn't turn out so well due to the weird shapes of the data.  The pdf above contains general information about variables and a few interesting comparisons.  Because of the way I compiled it, there is some information that you'll probably find irrelevant.  

The two main things that are important for understanding the data are:

1. p-values.  I explain this on the first page, but essentially whenever you test for a difference or correlation, you will get a p-value.  This is the probability that you would see results *at least* as extreme as the ones you currently have **under the assumption that there is no difference/correlation**.  Note that this is not always the case with statistical analysis, as they can refer to almost any kind of test, but in the case of this analysis, this definition is correct.  5%/0.05 is the usual cutoff value.

2. Bookmarks are very useful for navigating through data quickly.  All of the **univariate** stuff looks at the distribution of each individual variable.  **ANOVA** measures a continuous variable (e.g. Age) against a class variable (e.g. whether you like classical music or not).  **Freq**uency tables are basically what they sound like.  For tables with 2 variables, there are some values that show whether or not there's a relationship between the variables or not.

A few significant results:

1. Among those who practice music, those who have composed a piece of music practice at least 2.5 hours more per week than those who haven't.

2. There is no apparent trend in maximum years spent playing an instrument and how much one practices per week.

3. People who listen to internet radio on average spend at least 2.5 hours more per week listening to music than those who don't.

4. There isn't enough data to tell whether or not there are any differences between favorite genre and how much music someone listens to per week.  The boxplots appear different, but without enough numbers behind them, it's unlikely that they will produce significant results.

5. There is no apparent relationship with how much music people listen to per week and age.

6. There is no strong relationship between how much people practice per week and how much music they listen to.  There is a wide distribution for the 31+ hour practicing group, which indicates that it might be possible to discern differences with a bit more data.

7. Women play woodwind instruments more.  Men play brass instruments more.  Big surprise.

8. This data set showed an opposite of the expected trend with age and favorite genre being classical.  Older age groups were less likely to list it as their favorite and younger age groups were more likely.  This is largely due to the fact that I used /r/classicalmusic as my main data source.

Just a note:  39 data points were removed because they were improperly filled out (for those who answered multiple genres for favorite genre, I made an ""other/mixed"" category, but it wasn't that interesting for this analysis).  All removals were due to mathematical impossibilities (e.g. being 15 years old with 20 years of keyboard experience) or because data was nonsensical (e.g. age given was ""John"").

**If anyone has any requests for any other tests they'd like to see, let me know, as they don't usually take too much effort on my part.**

**If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know.  There are countless tests I could perform, and any advice on how to make them more interesting/meaningful would be greatly appreciated.**

Also, I realize that the way I worded some questions wasn't the best.  I'll do my best to avoid doing this in future surveys."	t5_2tlqg	True

Most answers were an integer, but some were ranges of hours (ie. 7-8). In these cases, the average was found and rounded up to the nearest integer. One respondent answered 0 hours, but seeing as the human body begins to shut down and deteriorate after 11 days without sleep (eventually leading to death) this answer was deemed an outlier. It is this man's opinion that Tony Stark himself graced us with a response.

The idea is to check if there is any measurable correlation between extroversion and dominance in personalities. I could just go off of the few results I got from my classmates, but this is much more fun. Let's make science!

Here are some texts from the last question:

&gt; ""Facebook has become creepy and annoying. I feel like I have to add everyone I have ever met or else I am a jackass. I don't want to play Farmville. I don't want to see you sharing iFunny images either. At least with twitter I can customize it to only who I care about and want to see updates from.""

&gt; ""Facebook isn't dying but other sites are becoming better and more useful, and new internet users would probably be more inclined to join sites like twitter instead of facebook.""

&gt; ""Facebook's invasive privacy standards drives away people who value having easy control over their own presentation to the world, combined with people feeling obligated to friend people whose memories they wanted to stay as memories, leads to a flight of those who aren't interested in only telling everyone about themselves. This leaves facebook as a bunch of people talking about themselves, to no-one in particular.""

&gt; ""Although not dying it's popularity has decreased. Since no site has appear to usurp it, I think it won't actually die for awhile.""

&gt; ""I dont think it's dying, what I think is that people is gradually getting bored of it, but it's an useful tool to use, so it will be used a long time""

And many others...


Thanks to everyone!

Thank you so much!  The analysis is [over here](http://www.towerofbabelfish.com/cms/blog/survey-results-the-difficult-sounds-of-german-for-english-speakers/).

Your goal is to say how similar/different the sounds are, on a scale from 5 (very/obviously different) to 1 (the same sound).

The recording is here: http://vocaroo.com/i/s1GVIptcPPQb

If you only have a couple of minutes, I have 4 new recordings for the test that are shorter (and slower!).  See bottom of post.

My email (send results here or post them): gwyner@towerofbabelfish.com


What to do: Either open up an email, text program, or reply to this post and get ready to type while listening to the recording (the quiz starts after 60 seconds of explanation).

You'll hear 113 pairs of words (strick - strock, strick-strick, strück-ströck, etc) and your goal is to write down how different they sound:
5: Very different (Meat-Mat)
4: Pretty different (easy to hear: Pfeet, pfit)
3: Different (Not too hard to hear the difference: Pfüte, Pföte)
2: Barely different (Hard to hear any difference: Drucken, Drücken)
1: The same (Mit - Mit)

If you can answer in this format, I'd be much obliged.

Languages spoken: English, Spanish, Whatever

1. 3
2. 2
3. 3
4. 1
5. 5

I'm working on a study about dogs and people, and we're looking for participants that would be interested in taking a short survey (about 10 minutes) where you'll view photos of dogs and provide feedback about them.

No experience with dogs is necessary. We do ask that you be over 18 and reside in the US. All your information is confidential, and we'll be happy to provide study results once we finish analyzing the data.

Thanks for reading - and hopefully participating in our study!

I originally posted this is ask reddit, but the top responses all suggested posting here, so here I am! 

 I'm on holidays visiting my family in the middle east (abu dhabi), and my younger sister, age 12, told me she needs to get people to fill out her 'dream holiday' survey for school. Unfortunately, she doesn't know enough people over 18 (which for some reason, the survey filler-outers are supposed to be?) to get the required base sample size of over 25 results. And being the Abu Dhabi, she can't exactly go door knocking.

I told her I 'knew some people' and thought reddit might come to the rescue here. The survey is very clearly made by a child, so go easy on her, but if you could take two minutes to fill it out, I know it would both help her out immensely AND make her day (and mine too - I barely get to see her as i live in australia, so helping her out with her homework I've never got to do before).

I would like to start by thanking the community here at /r/samplesize for helping so many people, and myself, with so many projects and for providing a really well balanced sample!

For detailed results for this survey, [here is the paper](http://i.imgur.com/pT5kTvG.png) that I wrote based on the survey for my psychology of language class.

Here are the basic results:

- Participants were very good at assessing the gender of each sample. Of all answers, 98.7% were correct.
- Participants were less accurate in assessing the ages of the sample speakers. Only 46.6% were accurate, which is still very good. After giving participants a +/- 1 age range window for correctness, the accuracy becomes 95.7%.
- The results from this survey support past research into peoples' general ability to determine age and gender based on voice alone.

There is still more analysis that I would like to do with the data that I received, and I may add that to this post in the future. There were some problems with my survey (lack of sample variety and low number of samples), but they were helpful in pointing out areas where my research could use improvement.

Hey dudes and dudettes,  

I'm doing some music market research for a school assignment that requires me to survey music fans. You're a music fan right?? I'm getting peeps from all over the globe to fill it out and ya'lls can partake too if you wish. It's a chance to have your perspective heard...... sort of  

Basically the survey is trying to gleen what kind of trends different demographics have with different bands/styles/artists/etc. It's completely anonymous and i can even share the final information with anyone who's keen when i collect the data/results on Tuesday night. On tues the data will go into my business plan thingo for the course i'm doing. And the bigger the sample size, the better the stats. So if you fill it out it would be SUPER DOOPERLY helpful! Who knows, you may even learn something.  

Only 10 questions. Shouldn't take toooo much time  

The survey can be filled out here: http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/WMXFPNV

I am a bit of a broke-ass student atm so I only have £50 (GBP, ~$80 USD) to pony up as an incentive, so at the end of the survey you will be asked whether you would like to see the money donated to [the EFF](https://www.eff.org/), [Child's Play](http://www.childsplaycharity.org/) or [Unicef](http://www.unicef.org/), and the money will be divided between them according to how participants want :)

Hey guys, I'm writing a study on anonymity on the internet and I thought reddit would make a good case study because of its quite varied communities.

The research should help us understand reddit a bit better. It's looking at aggressive behaviour, karma, novelty accounts, and secrecy in relation to the anonymity reddit can provide.

You don't have to be Americans, any nationality is fine as long as you are working full-time in United States.

If you prefer, for the question that asks for your email if you want to be included for the drawing, you can just put your reddit username! :)

If you have done this before but did not give your email (this question was added after a week of poor response), please do not do the survey again. PM me on reddit, I'll ask for verification and you'll be included manually.

And thank you!!

edit: thank you guys! keep 'em coming, i'm almost at 50 :D hopefully 60, in case i have to omit some responses! i did not mention when the results of drawing will be announced.. it's most likely on the 7th/8th of March if i keep to my schedule lol. thank you thank you thank you! :D your time is greatly appreciated.

""How long after a relationship of the given length is it acceptable to begin dating new people? Your answer should be the minimum socially acceptable amount of time.""  
  
[The results are here!](http://imgur.com/a/ZxQz6) A few notes about the graphs/process:  

* ""WTA stands for ""wait time average"", or the average wait time after  the end of a relationship of the given length that respondents thought you could begin a new relationship. 

* All of the graphs contain the same data, but the first two are sorted by age range and the last two are sorted by gender.

* In total, 118 people responded constructively.

* A few people in the comments of the original post noted that assumptions had to be made in the conditions of the relationship and/or breakup. This is a good point, but I didn't want to muck up the survey with too much instruction. Also, many people noted that two weeks isn't a real relationship, and that's reflected in the results!

Here's a few things that I thought were interesting about the results themselves:

* The wait times as a function of the relationship times fit a power law pretty well, as reflected on the graphs in the equations and R^2 values shown!

* The wait time decreased fairly regularly as age increased, but gender had no appreciable impact.

* Six people responded saying that no wait time was necessary for any relationship length, and others responded with things along the lines of ""whenever you feel ready"".

Help a psychology student out please and take this short survey on what makes a site trustworthy or not. One of my professors is in the early stages of developing a reliable and scientifically valid way of measuring the perceived trustworthiness of a website and has asked us to get as many respondents as possible to this first draft of the questionnaire.

He has also promised some kind of bonus to whoever gets the most respondents, I don't know what I could do for the reddit community in thanks if I won but I'm open to suggestions.

you may have any website you like in mind when answering the survey, but it may help in these early stages if you could pick an example that is either highly trustworthy or not trustworthy at all in your own estimation.

some suggested websites: any site where financial transactions take place (e-bay, banking services etc), newspapers, college websites, torrent sites, online tv services, blogs.
anything will do really.

take the survey here:http://hfrg.ucc.ie/trust/ and use the password: R39

Beste proefpersoon,

Doe mee aan dit korte online experiment van maximaal 10 minuten. Onder de deelnemers verloot ik 5 bol.com bonnen t.w.v. 20 euro!

Het is een kort experiment voor mijn afstudeerproject, over hoe mensen een mening vormen over iemand. Ik kan je meer informatie geven nadat je hebt deelgenomen!

Het onderzoek vind je op : http://studie.brllab.nl

Edit: website toegevoegd (sorry, dacht dat de link er bij stond!)

Edit2: Graag nog geen specifieke informatie in de comments loslaten. Zodra ik klaar ben met het onderzoek, zal ik laten weten waar het precies over ging! Het is belangrijk dat mensen 'blind' mee kunnen doen.

Edit3: Samen met /r/netherlands hebben jullie weer een student helemaal blij gemaakt! Deelnemers gaan supersnel. Zodra ik de website offline haal (hij blijft er nog even op) laat ik jullie het doel van het onderzoek weten! "	t5_2tlqg	True

I’m a PhD candidate in Counseling Psychology at the University of Missouri, working on my doctoral dissertation.  I can really use your help.  I’m interested in men’s health, masculinity, and men’s use of healthcare.  As such, I’m looking for a sample of adult males (e.g., 18 years or older) to take part in a one-time survey.  The survey will take approximately 20-30 minutes.  I intend to solicit approximately 200 participants for this study.  The purpose of this study is to examine how strongly specific variables and interactions between variables predict men’s access to care for physical health concerns.

Upon completion of the study, you are eligible to enter your information for a raffle prize drawing.  When data collection is complete, I will randomly select fifteen participants who will win a 12-month subscription to Reddit Gold (a $29.99 value).  So you’d be supporting scientific research about men’s health and wellness, while I support reddit by gifting you special access to the website.  It’s a win-win.

No identifying information will be collected at any time during this anonymous survey – though you will be asked to include your reddit username if you would like to considered for the raffle prize drawing.  If you have any questions or concerns about this study, please contact me via this Reddit account (throwaway_research) or by email at ccmh36@mail.missouri.edu.  Also, you can contact the University of Missouri Institutional Review Board (IRB) at (573) 882-9585 or umcresearchcirb@missouri.edu should you have any additional concerns.

First off, I'd like to give you guys a big thank you! I posted this quiz on here before and there was a huge turnout. It really helped with the data collection. Unfortunately, I still need more data, so I thought I would post this quiz again, especially now that it's the holidays and people might have more time.

This quiz is open for all (in fact, I'm hoping for lots of diversity) and there is no mobile/tablet support, so you need to do it on a computer. Description below is mostly taken from my original post:

I'm currently a medical student at the University of British Columbia. As part of some research I'm doing, I designed two short online quizzes (20-25 minutes) to gather data on either *facial identity recognition* or *facial expression recognition.* I need a number of participants to do this quiz, hopefully from a diverse group of people from a variety of backgrounds, ethniticities, etc.

As a small incentive, you will have a chance to win a $25 prepaid Visa gift card after completing the quiz. You will also be able to see how your facial recognition skills measure up against others. Finally, it's for science!

**For more information or to do the quiz, visit http://visualcognition.ca/face-quiz/.** No mobile devices (sorry). The link will take you to either the expression quiz or the identity quiz, depending on which needs more participants at the time. However, you can choose which one you'd like to do in the quiz itself.

It would help my research greatly if you could take the time to do one or both of the quizzes. If you don’t have the time, it would be great if you could leave an upvote so I can get more exposure for this post. This is a throwaway account so I don't get any karma for this! I can also assure you that the data will by no means be used for profit or for identification purposes.

So here are a few questions I would like to have answers for. This is of course not exhaustive, so feel free to speak your mind.

1) How long have you been using...well browsing reddit ?

2) Are you a goddamn kid (0-14 years old), a young one, still as green as summer (15-21), a potential terrorist (22-39), or a respected elder (39+) ?

3) What's your favorite sub reddit ? Why ? (read : what's wrong with you ?)

4) Do you speak about reddit to your friends, family, loved ones ? Or do you abide by the first &amp; second rule ?

5) Can you remember your best experience on reddit ? A post that saved a life ? A relationship ? Destroyed a civilization ?

6) How would you describe reddit to an innocent soul who has no idea what is it ?

7) Would you say there's a ""dark side"" to reddit ? Things that shouldn't be there ?

8) Has reddit turned you to the dark si...uh, has reddit changed you ?

You don't have to answer all these questions of course, pick what you like ! It's like a chocolate box ! Except you don't have to eat the shitty ones no one wants ! And it doesn't make you fat !

Two days and 366 responses later, I'm back with the results. 

**[Without further due](https://www.instant.ly/report/520d083ee4b0dd7e78d50247)** 

As you can see left-handed respondents are over-represented (the normal split would be around 10:90), and it's perfectly normal as I posted the survey on /r/southpaws in an effort to get a wider amount of responses from my fellow lefties.

**[Here's the graph version for the activities](http://i.imgur.com/CZcasDl.png)** and **[sports](http://i.imgur.com/vMCQCKp.png)** (I left out the not applicable respondents for clarity)

The highlight of this survey in my opinion is **the staggering domination of the right hand mouse**. **85% of lefties switch hand to use a computer mouse.** 

Unfortunately I wasn't able to perform advanced crosstab analysis as I intended before releasing the survey, the option wasn't available for some reason (it worked fine on a previous survey). Nonetheless I made a couple of things from the base csv file. 

---

[**Operating System**](http://i.imgur.com/Dg6EdJO.png)

There has been several articles saying that lefties are more likely to be Mac owners, and since I had the operating system used to do the survey in the data, I wanted to check that out. 

The results are **somewhat supportive** of that theory, with Mac users having the highest proportion of lefties, although the difference is marginal. 

---

[**Fapping techniques**](http://i.imgur.com/xysg90i.png)

Another popular belief around lefties is their supposed advantage when it comes to online fapping sessions: as shown above a staggering amount of lefties use a mouse with their right hand, leaving their natural left hand free for joyful activities. 

The survey shows that 52% of the respondents can fap with a different hand than their writing hand, but **this share goes up to 58% with a computer mouse and 60% with a touchpad**, indicating a willingess to multi-task while browsing. 

---

[**Optical dominance**](http://i.imgur.com/ORepLU6.png)

Wiki states that the distribution of optical dominance is 66:33 in favor of the right eye, and that there is no relation with the writing hand. 

Here those proportions are respected with a 64:36 split but **the left eye dominant folks are majoritarily left handed (56:44), and right eye dominant folks even more majoritarily right handed (71:29)**

Everyone (homo-, hetero-, bi-, asexual, pedophile or else, but older than 18) is welcome to participate!	kathrin_m	30	8	41	"We are a research team from the University of Bonn (Germany) and are conducting a scientific study on the origins of sexual orientation. To that aim we are investigating whether there is a causal link between childhood experiences, emotional dispositions, and sexual interests.

Until now we know very little about the development of different sexual interests. To learn more, we are reliant on reports from a large number of different people. There is some evidence that there is a link between specific types of childhood experiences and sexual orientation (homo- and heterosexuality). However, this evidence is inconclusive and very much disputed among scientists. There is also little known about the relationship between emotionality or childhood experiences and the general interest in sexuality. Moreover we know near to nothing about the causes of people developing sexual interest in children. This study is set up to improve all these situations. We are not moralizing about or judging any type of sexual interest, we want to improve our scientific knowledge about human sexuality and compare different kinds of sexual preferences.

We are looking for male and female participants who are sexually attracted to men, and/or women and/or children or are not interested in sexuality at all. Participants only need to fill in an online questionnaire and to judge the sexual attractiveness of non-nude pictures of adults and children. Our questionnaire covers topics such as emotionality, a range of childhood experiences, and (quite intimate) sexual fantasies and behaviors.

Filling in the questionnaire will take 25 minutes at maximum. The whole data collection and analysis is completely anonymous. Beside this questionnaire, absolutely no additional data (names, locations, IPs, email-addresses etc.) will be collected or stored. We have neither the means nor the intention to trace the participants of our study. Therefore it will not be possible to identify individual data sets or to give feedback on personal results, even on request of participants.

Our research interest is strictly scientific and aims exclusively at knowing more about the origins of different sexual interests in general, not about the sexual fantasies and behaviors of individuals.

We would be very grateful if you support our research by answering the questionnaire on the following link:

Right now ~~I'm looking for a few more mods.~~ **edit: Not really anymore. We've had a lot of great applications and are still reviewing. For those who have replied and haven't got a response yet, feel free to send us another message if we don't get back to you within ~24 hours. As this subreddit grows, we will continue to add more mods, and those of you who have submitted applications but for whatever reason aren't yet a mod will be the first to be considered.** Mainly I'd like people who value the scientific process (as unscientific as these methods sometimes can be) and appreciate the ideas behind this subreddit in general. If you'd like to be a mod, just send me a message that generally explains (1) why you'd like the position, (2) what you could bring to the subreddit, (3) what kind of surveys you think would work here (or wouldn't), and for curiosity's sake, what position you hold in a scientific community, if applicable.

Also I'm thinking about suggesting that surveyors let people know in their post title what kind of survey they are asking them to participate in, such as whether they are looking for more of a [free answer response in the comment section](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pyv2l/i_need_to_do_a_survey_for_my_statistics_class/) or a multiple choice questionnaire. This could be done by tagging the end of your post with things like [FR] (Free Response), [G] (Google Docs Survey), [SM] (Survey Monkey), etc. I actually [created a survey](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDlGcEN1Z2Z0NXpEalNnOWJyU1lxYWc6MQ) to see what people thought about this.

I can see the flow of this subreddit sort of looking like this: 

(1) Surveyor posts their survey (scientific or otherwise) on [/r/SampleSize](/r/SampleSize) and adds any additional comments in a self post if they feel they are necessary.

(2) Anyone willing/able to participate does so.

(3) If they are comfortable with doing so, and no personally identifying material is being released, surveyor posts results once the survey is completed and people can feel free to discuss them in the comments.

If any kind soul knows their way around photoshop and would be willing to create a [/r/SampleSize](/r/SampleSize) logo, it would be amazing. Rest assured, anything you produce is better than [my poor attempts.](http://i.imgur.com/07t82.jpg)

Also, if you have an idea for a survey, start working on one! Again, surveys can really be about anything, science or otherwise. Excellent sites to create free surveys would be [Google Docs](docs.google.com) (under ""Form"") and [Survey Monkey](http://surveymonkey.com/). You can use a google account to create surveys on both sites.

If anyone has any suggestions at all to help standardize or streamline the survey process for this subreddit, please share your ideas. Again, thank you for helping to grow this community for a better scientific understanding for everyone."	t5_2tlqg	True

I'm looking for participants in a study about personality and processing speed! The only requirement is that you are over the age of 18 :) The survey should take less than 10 minutes, and you will be debriefed at the end. I very much appreciate your honest participation as I will be writing an experimental paper based on the results and I need them to be valid and reliable :) Thank you so much for participating!!

*EDIT: I will also need you to enter my name at the beginning as my professor will be keeping track of how many participants each student in the class is recruiting! 
Please enter: Chrissy

*EDIT: **Important note: please do not post the results of your survey as they will inherently skew the survey for future participants and as this is part of a research study for a class I am taking and my grade depends on it, I would very much appreciate your respectful discretion. I apologize for not including this in the original post, however I had not anticipated the response!

*Final Edit: We have collected enough data at this point to analyze the results so the survey is now closed, and I would like to thank everyone who participated and let you know that we very much appreciate all the great feedback! "	t5_2tlqg	True

Sorry for all the reposts, but I still need more data and this is the only place I can think of to post it. A big thank you to everyone who did the quiz last time. It really helped with the data collection.

This quiz is open for all (in fact, I'm hoping for lots of diversity) and there is no mobile/tablet support, so you need to do it on a computer. Description below is mostly taken from my original post:

I'm currently a medical student at the University of British Columbia. As part of some research I'm doing, I designed two short online quizzes (20-25 minutes) to gather data on either facial identity recognition or facial expression recognition. I need a number of participants to do this quiz, hopefully from a diverse group of people from a variety of backgrounds, ethniticities, etc.
As a small incentive, you will have a chance to win a $25 prepaid Visa gift card after completing the quiz. You will also be able to see how your facial recognition skills measure up against others. Finally, it's for science!

**For more information or to do the quiz, visit http://visualcognition.ca/face-quiz/[2].** No mobile devices (sorry). The link will take you to either the expression quiz or the identity quiz, depending on which needs more participants at the time. However, you can choose which one you'd like to do in the quiz itself.

It would help my research greatly if you could take the time to do one or both of the quizzes. If you don’t have the time, it would be great if you could leave an upvote so I can get more exposure for this post. This is a throwaway account so I don't get any karma for this! I can also assure you that the data will by no means be used for profit or for identification purposes.

1344899558.0	y660p	[Results] Three questions about religion in the US		26	7	8	"Yesterday on reddit someone posted a comment in a thread that indicated that he thought that the US had an official state religion.  This wasn't the first time that I have seen such a comment, and so I wanted to get a sense of what people outside of the US thought the official state religion situation is in the US.

The truth is that the US does not have an official state religion.  The US Constitution prohibits a national state religion.  The states that make up the US were allowed to have official state religions but the last one was abolished in 1833.  In 1947 judges ruled that a 1868 amendment to the Constitution prohibits state religions at all levels of government.

Most Americans are completely ignorant of the concept of a state religion.  They do not realize that countries such as Sweden have an official religion.   (I am not implying that Sweden is in any way a theocracy).

Being an American, I assumed that the rest of the world knew that the US does not have a state religion, but I decided to investigate.  I didn't want to ask the question directly, so instead I made a poll with a bunch of plausible answers, along with the correct answer: other/none of the above.  I also added ""I don't know"" so that people who are ignorant - and know it - would have an answer that they could be proud of.

Question 1: How do Americans sign up for their official state church?

    Other/None of the above: 29 (43%)

    I don't know: 34 (50%)

    All other answers: 5 (6%)

Question 2: What is the official state church of the US?

    Other/None of the Above: 28 (41%)

    I don't know: 16 (24%)

    All other answers: 24 (35%)

Question 3: How do Americans support their official state church?

For one of my modules this term I shall be exploring the popularity of Star Wars, notably links between increased fandom and nostalgic reminiscing.

I am aware that many of you may despise Star Wars, but this is all part of my study: a balanced sample group.
I argue that those who prefer the Original trilogy are, generally speaking, more inclined to consume additional content: referred to as 'The Expanded Universe'.
More over, the (fairly) recent release of Star Wars: The Old Republic, will be a focal point of my study. This, in particular due to the release of an update focused on family ties, will serve as an example of nostalgic fulfillment.

What I require you to do is simply fill out a short questionnaire: http://survey.jointeffortstudios.com/index.php?sid=83914&amp;lang=en

The purpose of this of investigation is three-fold:
- To determine what group of individuals comprise the Star Wars fan base. Quantitative information such as gender and age categories will be paid special attention to determine such. It is here that results from the aforementioned questionnaire will be applied more prominently.
- Following on from this, what it is about Star Wars that generates such popularity shall then be examined. Whether or not it is the character and narrative progression, nostalgic fulfilment or something more.
- The final, and focal point of this study, will be an exploration of the extent to which the Star Wars community consumes the series, and everything around it, as a text. Although the results of the questionnaire will serve as the foundation for this area of investigation, the primary area of interest shall be focus groups."	t5_2tlqg	True

Political alignment doesn't seem to make much difference to the opinions but you can see that yourself in the full results. 


Breaking it down into countries there were 35 responses from Australia, 40 from Canada, 149 from the UK (123 England, 19 Scotland, 5 Wales, 2 NI), 3 from other Commonwealth Realms and 122 from Non-Commonwealth countries. 


**[Should the Monarchy be abolished after Queen Elizabeth II's reign has ended?](http://i.imgur.com/FGmJnP5.png)**

No country seems especially for abolishing the Monarchy, except other Commonwealth realms, but really there's not enough response to draw any conclusion. Australia is from these results much more divided on the issue than other countries. 

[**Would you prefer Prince Charles forgo becoming King in favour of Prince William?**](http://i.imgur.com/fauXFi4.png)

Most countries have a majority supporting Charles becoming King, though New Zealand is a bit more divided. 

[**How do you rate the Monarchy?**](http://i.imgur.com/XorRg6t.png)

Again, Australia is split pretty evenly between favourably and unfavourably whilst most other countries tend to think favourably of the Monarchy or neutral.

**Edit:** I would like to take a moment to thank all of you who have contributed to this survey so far. I'm finding the results to be both interesting and insightful (and in a couple of cases, a bit of an ego boost). Please feel free to engage me in discussion!

**Edit2 (Results):**

As promised, here are the results. I apologize for having to supply graphs of less-than-desirable quality, but I could not find a decent program to make this more simple and elegant (this is my first time actually having to put a bunch of graphs together).

Also, please keep in mind that all of these percentages are relative to responses given. A number of people either skipped questions or provided multiple answers to some portions at the end. A variety of answers were given as well that did not make up any large demographic, so trying to accurately reflect the number of people who responded with certain answers would have yielded much more work than I am willing to put into this. In other words, be sure to think of each graph in terms of ""out of those who responded to this question, these are the percentages for each response."" (My apologies if this sounds patronizing. That is not my intention)


**Demographic information:**

Here are the [graphs](http://imgur.com/Vb0umYY).

**The predominant demographics of those surveyed were:**

-heterosexual
-female
-ages 19 - 25

**Judgment information:**

Judged economic class: 85.71% middle class
Actual economic class: lower class

Judged belief system: 46.99% atheist, 24.1% agnostic, 14.46% Christian
Actual belief system: non-traditional, relaxed, Christian roots | formerly agnostic

Judged nationality/racial background: 37.23% European descent of some kind, 30.66% white/caucasian
Actual nationality/racial background: European ancestry (including German and Irish that I know of), some Native American, white/caucasian, American

Judgments made on appearance or health: 47.37% tired or sleep deprived in some way, 28.95% assume drug use
Comments regarding those judgments: I certainly am sleep-deprived, but I do not and have never engaged in drug use of any kind

Judgments on personality traits: 11.43% each for laid-back and ""outdoorsy.""
Comments regarding those judgments: both are accurate judgments.

Judgments on musical taste: Indie, alternative, and post-rock, at 50%, 25%, and 25% respectively.
Comments regarding those judgments: in most cases, I would call these judgments inaccurate.


**Conclusion:**
For the most part, those surveyed managed to make some surprisingly accurate judgments. I was very surprised, however, at the large percentage of people who believed me to be part of the middle class (I actually only live off of $12,000 a year). I was also expecting a larger amount of inaccuracy in the final portion, but people generally identified my characteristics pretty well. Overall, I found this rather insightful and interesting.

Thanks again for your help, everyone! I would also appreciate any thoughts or feedback you may have about this. I would be more than willing to discuss it with you!


Oh, and one last note... Whoever believed me to be, as I put it, ""un-punny,"" that has to be the funniest thing I read during this entire project. I guarantee that you would get sick of puns after a while if you knew me personally :)

1356370223.0	15dq6v	[Announcement] Best of 2012 Community Awards: Category Suggestions!	Calypsee	22	2	2	"**Hello r/samplesize!**

Us mods here would like to officially announce that we intend to take part in the **Best of 2012 Awards** here on reddit! As I understand it, in previous years, it was a site-wide competition, but this year, they have decided that the site has just gotten too large for that. This year, subreddits choose to do awards. 

Subreddits that have over 500 subscribers [hey, that's us!] are eligible to receive 5 creddits for reddit gold. We are in the process of applying for these creddits, but they are not yet confirmed. Even if something goes wrong and we don't get the creddits, we would still like to honour the members of our community for outstanding contributions.

We will be running a series of mod posts over the holidays and we suspect this will run over into the new year, but no matter! **Mod posts will include:**

- Category Nominations
- Category Vote
- User Nominations[/Category Announcement]
- User Vote
- Winners Announcement

Links for all of these will be posted in the sidebar as they appear. [Side note: Do any of our helpful/savvy users know how to make a sticky appear at the top of the page? We can't seem to figure it out!]

**Some general notes and rules** that will become more relevant later: We the mods reserve the 'right' to veto anything we dislike. We are fair and unbiased [moreso than FoxNews!], but if there has been any obvious poll-tampering, we will be correcting it. Bots and trolls are not eligible to win any creddits, and while those who already have reddit gold can be nominated, and win, the next highest placed user that does not have reddit gold will receive the creddit. Both users will be mentioned in the Winner Announcement thread though! Us mods cannot nominate any of the mods [but you can!], and a user cannot nominate themselves either. We the mods also reserve the 'right' to change these rules as we see fit. [Man, writing this, I sound like a big nasty company. If you've been here, you know that we're reasonable people and we're just trying to make this as fair as possible for everybody. We want this to be a fun event!]

Alright, that was long. So without further ado, please **comment on this thread** with what you'd like to see for **categories**. User nominations in this thread will be ignored. [Although you can start thinking about them, or make a category based on a user you'd like to nominate. Another note, we'd really appreciate if user nominations came with a link to the post/comment that fits the nomination if possible, so it might be a good idea to get hunting for those now!]

Please **read through the thread to see if your category has already been suggested**. We sadly cannot announce a concrete deadline for when this category nomination thread will be closed [some of the mods are without internet until the 27th], so just try your best to get things in early. We will do our best to ensure that all the categories are entered into the category survey that we'll be making.

**If you have more than one category you'd like to nominate**, please put it in a separate post as a reply to this post directly. We cannot guarantee that we'll be able to catch your category nomination if it is hidden in a thread as a reply to somebody else, so if while discussing something, a category pops into your head, just reply to the main post so that we can catch it! Thanks!

**Contest mode is enabled on this thread. This hides scores and randomizes the sorting.** If it turns out that we hate this feature, we won't continue it on later threads.

**All clear? Go for it! Make some category nominations!**

Basically, I wrote a small script that generated 10,000 mostly gibberish names. Some of them are interesting, though. Then, I wrote a tiny website to show you eight of them at a time, and you can click the best one or pass to the next set.

This is basically a crowd-source attempt. You click on the name you like and it adds a vote for it. I can then see which name has the most votes - you can do it whenever you like, if you come back, your spot will be saved.

http://skystronghold.com/name_picker/

Give it a try! I really appreciate every vote. Don't forget to upvote, either. This is a self-post so I'm not getting any karma. The more people that see this, the better. :D

EDIT: I might also add that I'm definitely not using these names verbatim. If you see one that's very close to being good, go ahead and vote for it. I'll make small changes to make them look better!

Fun fact: the first set of names I generated included ""phunvag"" and ""lfagbut"".

I'd like to thank you all for helping me to do that!  I kept an eye on the results as they came in, and the direction that people drew the circle seemed to hover fairly steadily at what became the end result.  [Here](http://imgur.com/a/Oc5Qp) is the album with the stats of each circle graph shown below, but I don't say anything different over there.

----

[Direction of Circle](http://i.imgur.com/92xsDv1.png)

* 57.3% of people surveyed drew their circles counter-clockwise

* 42.7% drew them clockwise

----
[Right v Left Breakdown](http://i.imgur.com/f6COH7k.png)

* 44.2% of Right handed people drew circle clockwise 

* 30.3% of Left handed people drew circle clockwise 

* 55.8% of Right handed people drew circle counter clockwise 

* 69.7% of Left handed people drew circle counter clockwise

----

[Letter ""o"" and Circle Direction](http://i.imgur.com/ZCAo2zt.png)

Alright, I know, this chart looks horrible.  I tried to make it a bit more intuitive though, because the way it was coded ended up being a bit confusing.

What this graph is trying to show is the people who drew their circles clockwise/counterclockwise and how they wrote the letter ""o"". 

* Shades of red represent people who wrote their ""o"" counter clockwise. The 50.5% on the bottom drew their circle counter-clockwise AND wrote ""o"" counterclockwise. The 23.7% on the upper left are people who drew circles clockwise but SWITCHED to counter-clockwise ""o""s.

* Shades of blue and ""kind-of-blue-maybe"" represent people who wrote the letter o clockwise. The larger chunk of 21.7% in the upper right are people who originally drew their circle clockwise and then wrote ""o"" clockwise as well. The sliver of 4% represents people who switched from a counterclockwise circle to a clockwise ""o"".

---

From the statistics, it looks like Right/Left hand usage does NOT determine whether you draw your circles clockwise or counterclockwise.  I had thought it might, but I was quite mistaken, particularly because MORE left handed people drew the circle counterclockwise, at least in this survey.

I found the number of people who switched from a clockwise circle to a counterclockwise ""o"" to be interesting though.  Notice that it doesn't happen all that much in the opposite direction.  People either stick to clockwise or go with counter clockwise, but only 4% in this survey switched from counter-clockwise circles to clockwise ""o""s.

Video game journalism is a topic that is constantly discussed, bashed, and praised on online forums with every new game release, which is one of the reasons why it interests me.

Any responses to the survey will help exponentially.

Thanks!

I am writing my thesis for my BA, and my research is on same sex couples and how they divide housework. I have created an online survey that starts with several close ended questions and ends with a few open ended questions. I estimate it will take about 20 minutes to complete. There are some restrictions concerning who can participate, in order to make data analysis easier.  They are:

Both members of the participating couple must be cis male or cis female

Participant must currently be in a same sex relationship

Participants must be residents of the U.S.

Participants must be 18 years of age or older

Couple must be living together in the same household

The couple must not live with any other roommates or family- the couple must be the primary occupants of the home/apartment

The couple must have no children living with them in the home full time. If participates have children they do not have primary custody of, meaning they do not live with them full time, then they still may participate.

If you are interested in participating, here is the link:

1359238030.0	17c3ug	survey for same sex couples about division of housework (details inside) /xpost from LGBT	spookyelectric	36	16	15	"Hello,

I am a Sociology major attending university in Oregon and I am writing my thesis for my BA. I chose the topic of same sex couples and how they divide housework because I find how couples negotiate their household very interesting and this topic is one that doesn't have much academic research on it. I have created a survey online **(link at the bottom)** that one participant of a couple should be able to complete in 10-20 minutes. It consists of mostly multiple choice questions but has a few opened ended questions at the end.

If you are interested in participating in my study, I have a few qualifications. They are:

Both members must be either cis male or cis female 

Participants must currently be in a same sex relationship

Participants must be residents of the U.S.

Participants must be 18 years of age or older

Couple must be living together in the same household

The couple must not live with any other roommates or family- the couple must be the primary occupants of the home/apartment

The couple must have no children living with them in the home full time. If participates have children they do not have primary custody of, meaning they do not live with them full time, then they still may participate.



The first page of my survey details a little more information about the study, so please read it before moving on to the survey. 

At the end, I ask for voluntary participants to leave their email- this is not necessary for completing the survey and if you do not feel comfortable doing so, please skip this question.

I will be around most of the day to field questions, and ask that if you have friends that qualify you forward it to them! Thank you very much!

[Languages spoken](http://i.imgur.com/mAQ19Tf.png): Only 148 of the respondents indicated that they speak English which is interesting since the survey is written in English- perhaps the question needed clarification. Most respondents also spoke French (53), Spanish (52), German (38) and Japanese (22). There were more respondents who spoke languages of European origin than languages of Asian origin. In addition to those languages listed, respondents also indicated that they spoke a variety of other languages including but not limited to Swedish, Welsh, Hungarian, Dutch, Italian, Polish and various Sign Languages including German and ASL. 

[Wanting to learn other languages](http://i.imgur.com/nUEWcBk.png): 37% of respondents indicated that they would be interested in learning a language from a list of endangered or not-commonly used languages. Of these, the most were interested in learning Okinawan 16%, Ainu (14%) or Ket (14%). Only two of nine Australians who responded to the survey expressed an interest in an Australian Aboriginal language. Respondents listed a variety of languages not listed which they wished to learn including, but not limited to Dutch, Spanish, Mandarin, Japanese, Sanskrit, Tamil, Arabic, Hebrew, Czech, Tagalog, Latin and Maori. Two respondents listed that they wished to learn Klingon, while one listed Elvish. 

Thankyou all for taking the survey! And thanks heaps to those who offered advice and pointed out problems~!

Under a recent addition to UK legislation, namely the 2011 Localism Bill, a trial is currently being run across the Country for neighbourhood planning forums - this will enable, in theory local residents to have more say and a greater influence on planning matters where it affects them most - where they live. 

More locally:

Where I live, as a precursor to this has been something called the Blue Print - which had a total response of 2.69% of the village population respond, yet they still have continued and based all policy, plans and everything else one what seems to me to be non representative of the village as a whole. 

**So the question**

With a total number of 2,427 households and a population of 6,190 (based on 2001 census results from the National Office for Statistics) for a particular village, what would be the minimum sample size based on:

* Household numbers (assuming 1 household = 1 response)
* Population numbers (assuming 1 resident = 1 response)

Hello and welcome to the testing environment. You may not be there now, but you can see it from here.
This thread is a request for online testing candidates to participate in a Real Life Scientific Study that uses Portal 2. 
If that isn't enough to win you over, you can win 100$ by doing it.

* Who are you?

I am a masters student in Psychology at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga and I am looking for help with my thesis in the form of playtesters.

* Playtest?

It's probably better to get into the meat of it right now, here is the situation. 
My master's thesis focused on cognitive ability (IQ) and performance within a simulated environment context. More simply stated, I want to see if your natural mental ability (when previous experience is controlled for) can predict your performance within a game.

I am using the game Portal 2 as the tool for my study, and I have spent 11 months working on this project (about 15 hours a week) to bring it to this playtesting stage. I've created a set of 7 training levels, 4 training evaluation levels, and 15 test levels, all of which are custom Portal 2 maps. The initial 7 levels are embedded with audio narration that teach players how to play the game step by step. These are followed by 4 easy puzzles with no narration before beginning the remaining levels which increase in difficulty.

What I need help with is making sure that these game levels progress smoothly in difficulty, with later levels becoming increasingly harder to complete just as an IQ test's questions get harder as you go. I also need to cut out some of these levels to make the entire thing take only an hour and 30 minutes. How many levels and which ones need to be cut is what I need help determining and I need use actual gameplay data to justify this.
If you help me out for 1.5 hours, you may win 100$ for your time.

* Who can participate?

For this internet norming process, any person with a registered reddit account may participate. Any and all skill levels for the game are invited to play. 

* What do I need?

You will require your own copy of Portal 2. You must understand the English language, not possess any photosensitive condition, nor be unable to hear the audio narration and music/sound cues in the game (whether this is due to a hearing disability or you don't own speakers/headphones).

* You said 100$

For Reddit members only, all participants will be entered into a random drawing for one amount of 100$ delivered in whatever method that is reasonable (visa gift card, western union, paypal, etc.).
Members of the SomethingAwful forums have a separate reward incentive from Reddit (I am going to advertise there too), and if you are a member of both websites you may only participate in one of these offerings. Please don't try to scam me and do both website's studies.

* How long will this take from my busy social life?

I am asking only for an hour and 30 minutes of playtesting time, and only about 20 minutes outside of that to fillout a form and set up your copy of Portal 2 to work. You can play through the levels for longer than 1.5 hours if you want, but I'm not going to use your data beyond that.

* I like money/science how do I participate?

1. First off make sure your copy of Portal 2 is installed and running smoothly, I have learned a lot about fixing Portal through the study but if its broken before you even get my files I have no idea what will happen. I doubt this needs to be said, but you must have a copy of Portal 2 and not Portal 1, and I do not take responsibility if this melts your dual quantum overclocked e-machine.

2. Once you have made sure Portal 2 works, please complete the internet participant information form on my website (its short) at: www.begintesting.com/internetform.html
 
3. Next, you will need to get the project files. Download these at: www.begintesting.com/pilot.zip 

You will need to extract the portal2 and sdk_content folders into your ""Program Files/Steam/steamapps/common/Portal 2"" folder.
If you are at the right folder, you should see these folders in the directory already. Make sure to copy and replace (overwrite each original file) with these new ones.

*See the below Technical Note if you intend to play the Portal 2 Story Mode!*

After extracting the files here is the process to follow:

Setting up Portal 2

1. Launch steam and goto your games library. Right-click on Portal 2 and select Properties
2. Click the Set Launch Options Button
3. Type exactly: -console
4. Click okay, close the properties box, and launch Portal 2
5. Once you are at the title screen Press the ~ key to bring up the console (if it is not already open)
6. Type this into the console: snd_rebuildaudiocache
7. Portal will sit there and look like its loading a map for a while, then the progress bar will turn orange. This means it is done, press the console button a few times to bring the console back up. It should have a series of indicator messages that end at 100%.
8. Then type exactly: exit

Beginning the session

1. Open Portal 2 again when you are ready to play for 1 1/2 hours.
2. In the console type: record_research_data 1
3. Press enter, then type: map training_chamber_01
4. Play through the game until either 1 1/2 hours have passed, or you finish the game's levels.

Sending the Data

1. Open your ""Program Files/Steam/steamapps/common/Portal 2/portal2"" folder.
2. You should find near the bottom a file named ""portal2_research_data""
3. Open it if you wish to see your performance (please don't change anything in here), otherwise email it to me at csbuford@gmail.com
4. ??? Profit and make yourself a drink, Lottery winners will be announced before Halloween, 2013.

* Technical Note

You will need to overwrite your portal directory in your steam folder with a set of custom files that I have created for the study. As long as these files are present, you will not be able to play the single-player mode of the game. Multiplayer will work just fine. You can remove my files by having steam verify the game cache or by reinstalling the game.

Note: This is not a mod because when I began the project I knew nothing about making anything, disabling the single-player campaign was a benefit when installing this on a public computer lab, and because I did not originally intend to distribute this over the internet.

* Sentimentals

Thank you for reading this and (if you did) participating in my project. This project means a lot to me and it means quite a lot to have your willing participation. I have no financial support (aside from a university grant that barely pays for the instruments I need), no technical oversight/support, nor any assisting researchers. This project is a work of love that I've been undertaking for 11 months now while also completing my first of two years of graduate school. A lot of anxiety is in this zip file.
I have many people to thank for their help, most of all my partner Regina (who did all the narration for the game). If you are interested, this is what we look like: www.begintesting.com/authors.jpg . I'd also like to thank the people I've worked with at Valve and the open-mindedness of my university. 

Want to send me a message? I will check this thread but I prefer email: csbuford@gmail.com
