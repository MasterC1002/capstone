Soon after my mate comes around, gets me some dinner and takes me to the hospital where I got an xray and diagnosis and was discharged all within two hours and I came home to find my neighbour had tidied my unit for me. I slept fairly comfortably loaded up with drugs from the hospital (which at no point I had to spend a single cent on). I wake up this morning and my boss called me to tell me that because I was on my way to work I'm eligible for workers compo and that she'll take my details down and that I'll probably get enough money to get a new pushbike and compensation for lost income for as long as I'm broken. As a recent migrant, I fucking love this country. Where I'm originally from, I would have gotten precisely **none** of the above aside from a lift to the hospital. 

Anyway **TLDR**: moral of the story, before you complain next about how something sucks here, think back for a second about its better here than pretty much anywhere else on the planet.

For some reason, I was asked to be on a small committee/focus group that will be advising the government on a complete redesign of the centrelink website.


(I was chosen, I think, because I am young person who is fairly active in the community)

The main goal of the website redesign is to make it as easy as possible for people to find the services they need (if you've spent 5 minutes on the current centrelink website, you'll know how bad it is now)

Anyway, even though I know next to nothing about design principles, I decided to accept the invitation, because this is something I care about and I thought it would be a good opportunity to make a difference.

So, reddit, please give me some advice.

What are the main features that this new website should have?

What are some websites that already have these features?

What should the website avoid at all costs?

And is there anything else you think I should know?

Please respond to this by Thursday evening if you can, or Friday morning at the latest.

**Edit:** Thanks everyone for being so helpful and making some great suggestions, I'll be sure to pass them on."	t5_2qh8e	True

1368957496.0	1emhqq	Hey /r/australia - let's get the anti-vaxers off the top of Google search results	thoughtpod	789	183	149	"Finally, the Government is getting serious about squashing the misleadingly named Australian Vaccination Network. The problem is, their nutty claims should never have been tolerated by the media in the first place.

Sadly, when you type in ""Australia vaccination"" into Google, the Anti-Vaxers some up as result number two, meaning that people get exposed to their harmful anti-science, and might end up putting their kids (and your kids) in danger.

Want to help stop these idiots from being so prominent in searches? Do you own any websites? If so, here's what you can do:

**/1/** Write a short article about vaccination on your website.

**/2/** Create 1 - 2 links using the words ""vaccinate"", ""vaccination"" or australian vaccination"" as the link words, and link them to these reputable vaccination sites:

- http://www.vaccination.org.au/
- http://www.immunise.health.gov.au/
- http://www.ncirs.edu.au/
- http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Immunisation_common_misconceptions-

This will help put these websites above the AVN website in google search results.

**/3/** Use the keywords 'Australian Vaccination Network' to hyperlink to the following website: http://stopavn.com/ 
This will help make sure that people who search for the AVN see as the first search results a site that discredits them.

If you do this, you can have a direct impact on vaccination in Australia. So, help out - and please, share this message! Note - I am not associated with any anti-vaccination group - just an Australian wanting to do my part.

Edit: Thanks /u/aegist for helping clarify my wording in point 3 - I think it reads far more clearly now."	t5_2qh8e	True

I think that it would be great to get Dr Karl on Reddit and interacting with other Redditors, and get some science going.

So if you could spare an up-vote that would be awesome.

**Edit** Wow! When /r/Australia wants something it gets onto it pronto! Thanks everybody who rang/emailed/asked/tweeted the big man himself.

I have asked the IamA mods how we can schedule Dr K in and once the process is sorted I will get in touch with his peeps so we can get this locked in.

If for some odd reason IamA can't come through with the goods we'll do it here and invite /r/science, /r/geek and a few others.

Slurping away on my Coke, I notice something funny on the cup. Stickers... what are they doing here? Gently pulling them off, I noticed on the other side and in bold text the words 'INSTANT WIN!'.

WOW I thought, THIS IS MY LUCKY DAY. 

I read on further; 'Free Game Download'.

Oh my God... a FREE game download? I LOVE games. This is seriously the best day ever, I thought.

Off to the McDonalds website I hurriedly go, input all my details to claim my prize. I admit, I did have to give them a lot of information, but for a free game (considering I LOVE games), it was totally going to be worth it.

Finally I get to the point where I input my unique code, and I wait with anticipation as the page loads. What will my game be? I wondered.

""Congratulations you're a winner of a Free Game Download.

Your prize is a Free Pickle Mania Game download that entitles you to download the Pickle Mania game at www.picklemania.com.au. ""

Picklemania I thought... have not heard of that. Is it like trackmania? Is it part of the Call of Duty series? I wasn't sure, but I was definitely  keen to give it a go.

Once I got to the website, I started looking for my download. Perhaps I needed a new account on this site too? Oh well, I input all my details again and continued to look.

It was at this point, that I realised they were not going to allow me to download my copy of picklemania for PC. As the realisation sunk in, I admit, I did start to feel a little let down inside. I had genuinely hoped to be able to shoot the Hamburgler in my spare time from a PC of my choosing, whether connected to the internet or not, but alas, the game was actually a web based game that anyone could play for free.

What had I actually won? 1000 in-game 'coins'. These allowed me to purchase a new kind of weapon. Perhaps this would assist me to defeat the Hamburgler and save the day. But alas, that was not the point, I was already defeated, defeated inside, defeated in my heart... because the game would never really be 'mine'.

That is my story.

Just to update the AMA request for Dr Karl.

I've had a chat to his ""people"" and everybody is keen to do it but he has to get some other stuff out of the way first not least of which is to finish his current book.

So we're looking at least a month before we can hammer out a date but when it gets figured out it should be booked into the official AMA schedule so that everybody knows when it is. In the meantime I'll keep people up to date as new updates come in.
 
**PS: No karma for me from any of this so please up-vote so that people are aware of what the current situation is.**

Victorian Police and her husband and family have asked that we be careful what we say about the case online because it could impact the trial. Saying things about any alleged offenders, including comments about past history etc can make it easier for the defence to argue a person charged won't get a fair trial. Worse still, it could see a conviction overturned. 

It's actually more likely the person responsible will be brought to justice if we show some restraint on here. I'm not saying that the legal system has got that right or wrong. But that's the way it is. And we shouldn't ignore it.

I asked the mods to make a post - thinking it would get more attention but they refused. So I'm asking us to step up and do the sensible thing as a community.

Not to mention you can already sue the pants off these people if you really want to anyway.

ThunderCuntAU	539	95	331	"I've seen a great number of posts here about outsiders coming to Australia, and we're always happy to provide as much assistance and realistic advice as possible. I've mentioned this in the past, and noticed (more recently) a greater influx of these posts, so I'll try and collaborate a little bit of generalized advice that seems to recur on the threads -- if I've missed anything, let me know!

**A great resource, whether you're a student, graduate or professional is the [Immigration website](http://www.immi.gov.au/).** It has surprisingly little jargon and should be easy to navigate if you know what you're looking for.

If you're looking to move to Australia permanently, and you're a student or a graduate, you - in all likelihood - aren't going to be able simply apply and become a permanent resident. As a student, you should be applying for a [Student Visa](http://www.immi.gov.au/students/students/chooser/). Complete your course, find an employee looking for fresh graduates and *hope that they sponsor you as a working migrant*. If you graduated overseas and have little industry experience, you - in all likelihood - will not find a company to simply pay for and sponsor you trip to Australia. It's an expensive investment and one that may not work out for their business, so why would they? Get yourself a [working holiday visa](http://www.immi.gov.au/visitors/working-holiday/index.htm), find a job *once you're here* and, at some point before the expiry of your visa, hope that you're viewed as a valuable asset to the company and request that they sponsor you for permanent residency.

If you've got many years of industry experience under your belt, you may have more luck finding a company to pay for and sponsor you to come to Australia immediately. The largest job search site in Australia is [Seek](http://www.seek.com.au/). If this fails, then I would recommend the above; come over here on a working visa (provided you're under 30), find work, and see if they're willing to sponsor you.

Outside of the above, you should be aware of the [Skilled Occupation List](http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/sol/). This site lists a number of roles where there are recognized shortages in the industry; if you are qualified to do these jobs, you've got a leg up on becoming an Australian! It is my understanding that you'll be prioritized if you're applying for a student visa in these fields, as well, but I'm happy to be told otherwise.

** What is the job market like in Australia?? **

Better than most Western countries, but it largely depends what industry you're in and what your resume looks like. Look at the Skilled Occupation List above. That should provide a bit more insight. For specifics, however, feel free to ask and I'm sure there's someone here loosely related to your field that can point you in the right direction.

** What is the cost of living like in Australia?? **

Most of us will tell you it's fucking high, and rightfully so. The property market is absurd and is probably going to be the biggest drain on your salary. Since we get a lot of Americans in here that typically say something about the cost of living in New York being comparable when we tell them this, Sydney is more expensive. Melbourne is close to par. Perth &amp; Brisbane are about as expensive as LA. Adelaide is about as expensive as SF. 

Anecdotally, the price of everything from electronics to cars to clothing is (significantly) more expensive. Generally, we get paid more which compensates, and the disparity of wealth isn't as significant in contrast to, say, the States.

With regards to the cost of living, the actual quality of living is high. Australian cities are ranked, consistently, among the most livable cities in the world. We will complain about Australia, our shitty public transport and our moronic government, but by and large, it's a pretty damn good place to live.

** I'm a x/y/z, which city is for me? **

Couldn't tell you. Perhaps someone will reply with some generalized advice for the cities, but otherwise, just ask (or use Seek and the # of jobs around the city as your litmus test).

** I want to come to Australia to get a mining job. What do I need to do? **

Good luck with that. Let us know when you work it out. General consensus in these threads is it's not what you know, but who you know. Other advice consists of ""join the queue"".

** What are the police like?? **

Well, you're probably American if you're asking this, so you might have it drilled into your head that you should refuse to talk to police / refuse to answer their questions and repeat ""am I free to go?"" I don't think that advice is very helpful in Australia. Being human is usually a good way to go about doing things -- be civil, cooperate (e.g. if they ask for your name, just tell them) and you'll be on your merry way. I've gotten out of plenty of misadventures by just playing dumb and treating the officer as if they're a human. 

** What about tipping?? **

Employees are paid a reasonable wage. Tips aren't used to compensate an employer that is not paying their employees a reasonable wage. You *can* tip in the service industry, and I'm sure they'd welcome it -- it is usually reserved for exceptional service. 

** I like beaches. I want to live in a coastal city. **

Australia is about 3/4 desert. All of our major cities are built on the coast, except Canberra. (And who wants to live there anyway?)

** How do I make friends? Are you all douches? **

We're fairly happy go lucky people. Don't take yourself or your cause too seriously or we'll be awfully skeptical of you. Your mate is a cunt. Your enemy is just a bit of a shit bloke.

** Will everything in Australia kill me? **

You'll be right. If you're worried about it: shake out your shoes before you put them on and don't stick your hand in any dark holes. Both are prime spider real estate. It's worse in rural areas.

** What about religion in Australia? **

[Take a look at the top graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Australia). Religiosity is on the decline in Australia. Even within the graph, there's only a small subset that actually frequently attend church. People aren't in-your-face religious. As above, we're fairly skeptical of people who take themselves or their cause too seriously -- this includes religion. There are Bible bashers that come around trying to proselytize on the odd occasion; feel free to ignore them, god knows everyone else does.

**Where do you shop??**

Supermarkets are, by and large, controlled by two massive companies: Woolworths and Wesfarmers (Safeway &amp; Coles). We've got a CostCo in Melbourne, which I've heard is massive and pretty cool. Aldi is around that is a cheap alternative. 

We (Redditors) seem to like shopping online given how often shopping threads come up. See the r/Aus sidebar for a few more hints. Importing games is nearly always cheaper than going instore to buy them. 

** What about food?? Anything I should know? **

I've noticed [istara](http://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/feplf/thinking_of_moving_to_australia_from_the_us_any/c1fd1uk) write a few posts on this. Go give her some karma. We have less HFCS because we don't have the absurd corn subsidies that are in place in the States. We do, however, seem to be falling behind the rest of the developed world when it comes to regulating certain food additives.

On this note: I've always been impartial to Cadbury chocolate. I'm sure this makes me a derelict hobo in the eyes of a few Aussie Redditors, and I'm okay with that. It's cheap and tastes nice. You haters can continue to hate.

** Anything I should know about Australian politics??**

It's all about ""hard working families"" in Australia. Two major parties: the Liberals (tip: the name is a misnomer) and Labor. The Wiki or the party's websites would probably do them more justice than I could in a soundbite.

We have mandatory voting. It is a preferential voting system and *not* first past the post.

**What about censorship??**

There is no internet censorship. I repeat: none. This has dropped off the government's agenda for the time being because it's grossly unpopular. Hopefully we remain vigilante and they just drop it entirely.

Some games are censored. It is illegal to sell these games in retail stores. Import them from the UK/US/Asia (personally, I find that the UK is almost *always* cheaper). We don't like it either. There has been plenty of movement this year (and last) from the politicians and AGs to *finally* get some reform in our classification laws.

Are small tits banned? This is a misconception thrown around by the internet hype machine. A woman's overall appearance is assessed when making judgment about whether she's underage -- this includes breasts. It is one facet of the assessment. Please don't help perpetuate this myth!

** Is everything really upside down?**

Maybe I'm just a bit of a stick in the mud, but while this joke may have been mildly amusing the first time one hears it, and may have even garnered a few sympathy laughs on subsequent usage, it does grow a little tiring. You're the customer in the service industry that says ""Savings?! More like spendings!""

If anyone has any other questions that should be added (this is by no means extensive, and parts of it could be completely off-base), reply and I'll get it sorted. "	t5_2qh8e	True

You're not American, get a fucking refund.	moorow	517	70	108	"The US has very little consumer protection, but Australia is pretty good with it. Australian Consumer Law dictates that at no point in time can a consumer waive the right to have defective or misrepresented goods refunded at full cost, whether it's defective when you receive the product or at a later point in time within a timeframe relative to the price you paid (2 years for a $500-1000 smartphone, 5 years for a $5000 TV, etc).


If a company stiffs you on a refund (as EA did here with the whole ""we never refund goods bought through digital distribution channels"" line), submit a complaint through your local Consumer Protection agency. They'll take care of the whole thing for you, and companies tend to want to keep them happy to avoid fines.


I bought Simcity just prior to release, only to have it not work (unsurprisingly). This kept up for a week or so before I basically said ""fuck it"" and asked for a refund from an EA CSR. He totally fobbed me off, so I submitted a complaint to the WA DoCP. 3 days later I got a call from a DoCP agent, chasing up some more information. 3 days after that, I got a full refund from EA (and got to keep the free game they handed out to placate people).


Keep this in mind if a company ever tries to deny you warranty. Smartphones are a big one for this, particularly rooted Android phones  - as long as the phone is less than 2 years old, they're obliged to fix your phone if it's a manufacturing or other fault. We did the same thing for a family member's 10 day old HTC One XL, when the backlight on the screen broke and Telstra folded pretty efficiently. 

Submit a complaint through http://www.commerce.wa.gov.au/consumerprotection/content/consumers/Complaints/Making_a_complaint.html (for WA, other sites for other states) and let them deal with it instead."	t5_2qh8e	True

Consider just having a rally of solidarity instead, please. You will make yourselves, and the ""occupy"" movement in general, look bad if you carry out these actions. We are not American, we should support our US cousins, but realize that our situation is not the same. If you really think these actions are necessary,  AT LEAST BE ABLE TO SPELL OUT WHY YOU ARE PROTESTING. The organizer of Occupy melbourne even stated that:
&gt;''It sounds broad and vague because it is. It is for the people of Melbourne to decide what the agenda is,''
  
IF YOU CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY YOU ARE PROTESTING, YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE PROTESTING, LET ALONE OCCUPYING PUBLIC SPACE.

&gt;In fact, income inequality has gotten so extreme here that the US now ranks 93rd in the world in ""income equality."" China's ahead of us. So is India. So is Iran.  
  
The chart lists Australia as 25th in this regard (according to the [Gini coefficient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient) system of measurement). Just an indication that Australia is not the same as the USA, for what it is worth.

I forgot the link: [here] (http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-07-19/kevin-rudd-says-any-asylum-seeker-arriving-by-boat/4831956)

EDIT: I've been seeing a lot of ""slippery slope"" arguments about how this is terribly inhumane and how PNG is a horribly violent place to be in and thus refugees shouldn't be directed there. While these aren't invalid per se, this new policy isn't as one-dimensional as it has been made out to be on here. Please actually listen to (watch the video) how he elaborates on the way this is going to play out and not just circlejerk after reading the short title.

If you're too lazy to, and/or if politicians talking immediately bore you to death then here're a few of the things that are in this agreement.

&gt;The Australian government in support of the PNG government will provide comprehensive support to ensure that these refugees can live safely and with security, and in time, with prosperity within PNG. (6:50 of the video)

&gt;We've agreed that Australia will now help with the redevelopment of the major referral hospital in Lae and its long-term management needs. We've agreed to fund 50-50 the reform of PNG's university sector. We've also agreed to help PNG with the support they have sought in professional management teams and the health education and law and order portfolios. (7:50 of the video)

However, maybe the more cynical of us would take these words with a grain of salt.

The eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month attained a special significance in the post-war years. The moment when hostilities ceased on the Western Front became universally associated with the remembrance of those who had died in the war. This first modern world conflict had brought about the mobilisation of over 70 million people and left between 9 and 13 million dead, perhaps as many as one-third of them with no known grave. The allied nations chose this day and time for the commemoration of their war dead.

With defeat looking very likely for the ALP in September, I have to shake my head at the ALP and the way they present themselves to the public.  Do they not have a marketing (spin FWIW) department?  

Average Joe in the street will (and do) tell you that this is the worst government to have ever been in power in the country.  Why do they say this?  Looking at the Rudd/Gillard achievements and comparing them globally they have an outstanding record.  An economy that is the envy of the world, no recession in 21 years, low interest rates, low unemployment, constantly rated (along with the Scandinavian countries) as one of, if not the, best countries in the world.  

Yet, despite the above, and more, the ALP is headed for oblivion by an opposition government that have almost no policies, seem to be doing it's best to NOT get elected, and have one of the most unlike-able leaders in recent memory.  Why?  

It's the same with the NBN.  I bet if you asked the average person in a suburban street about the NBN the majority would only know it as a $50 billion white elephant.  That's all I ever hear or see on TV or in the main stream media.  Sure, The Delimiter et al. have articles extolling the virtues of FTTP NBN, but they are very much preaching to the converted.  Where is the public education campaigns explaining the LONG TERM benefits of FTTP NBN and what it will mean for healthcare, rural people, decentralization of work, telecommuting, future proofing etc.?  

It seems to me that Labor have absolutely no idea how to promote themselves and their policies.  Rather than going on the attack and telling the Australian public about how well we are doing, domestically and globally, the ALP always seems to be on the defensive, generally from shitty spun arguments from the opposition.  

So that leads me to ask, how and why have the ALP been so incompetent in promoting themselves?  Surely marketing, promotion, public perception and - yes - spin, has to be one of the most important aspects of government these days?  

Am I off the mark and are Labor really that shit?  "	t5_2qh8e	True

* It's a myth that parent birds will reject their young if they smell of human. If you find a baby bird that's not yet properly feathered, look around for the nest. If possible, pop it back in. If the nest is too high or you can't find it, check to see if the parents are still around- if they are, put the baby near them on a branch, and they'll keep taking care of it. 

* The young of some species of bird need to spend time on the ground when they're learning to fly. If you see a young magpie, lapwing, or noisy miner and its family are around, it's perfectly fine and you should leave it alone.

* Don't feed birds bread or mince. Parents will feed it in turn to their young, leading to mineral deficiencies and dead babies. Leave 'em alone, they can feed themselves.

* If you have a bird that's been injured by a cat or dog, no matter how small the wound, get it to a wildlife carer pronto. Dogs and cats have filthy mouths, and birds will succumb to infection really quickly.

* If you have a bird that needs to go to a rescuer, keep it somewhere warm, dry, dark, and quiet. Birds have body temperatures of over 40 degrees and freak the fuck out very easily; being cold or stressed will kill them pretty quickly. Even ducklings. Especially ducklings.

* If you've got a bit of spare time and like animals, your local fauna rescue group will love to have you on board. Alternatively, any donations of towels, blankets, cloths, or that sort of thing would probably be appreciated. 



Also, as most people seem to have no idea of what everyday birds are called, here's a brief rundown of the most common birds in suburbia:

* [AUSTRALIAN MAGPIE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Magpie)
(aka Piping Shrike, Rolling Shrike, Piping Roller)

The Aussie Magpie is a large sedentary passerine, which is the ornithologists' way of saying that it's a fat lazy creature that never shuts up (in related news, ornithologists have the most obtuse yo mama jokes). They live in family groups and defend their home turf, much like the mafia, and spend all of their time waddling around on your front lawn and making ridiculous noises, hopefully completely unlike the mafia. Once a year the males kamikaze-attack small children and posties, easily making them the most hilarious bird in Australia to everyone who is not a small child or a postie. 

* [MAGPIE-LARK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magpie-lark)
(aka Mudlark, Murray Magpie, Peewee)

The Magpie-Lark is distinguishable from the Magpie by dint of being crap. They are always found in pairs, shouting at passers-by and doing nothing of worth, making them the street fundraisers of the bird world. Their superpower is the ability to vomit up their houses, which, while horrific, certainly is a solution to the housing crisis.

* [WILLY WAGTAIL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Wagtail)

Willy Wagtails can usually be found dancing and singing, making them an episode of Glee in bird format. Much like an episode of Glee, they're more or less completely pointless.

* PIGEONS

Some are [native](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crested_Pigeon). Some [are](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Pigeon) [not](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotted_Dove). Unless you have somehow become stuck in the 1920s and need something delivered, all of them are pretty useless.

* [NOISY MINERS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noisy_Miner)

Yobs in bird form. They hate you, they hate other birds, and they hate everything else, too. Most commonly found fucking another bird's shit up and trying to figure out a way to wield trolleybars.

* [ROSELLAS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosella)

Gay parrots.

* [RAINBOW LORIKEETS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Lorikeet)

The gayest parrots. 

* [MASKED LAPWING](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masked_Lapwing)
(aka Spur-Winged Plover, Masked Plover, ACK ACK ACK ACK ACK)

Lapwings sound like the aliens from Mars Attacks, have weaponised spikes on their wings, and look like someone melted a Kraft cheese square on their faces. I can only assume that these are birds designed by H. P. Lovecraft purely to spread hatred throughout suburban Australia. Avoid them whenever possible; unless your job and/or social circle requires you to be tormented by a cheddar-faced monstrosity, this should not be a problem."	t5_2qh8e	True

1332467767.0	r9c11	CentreLink Joke	micksb	519	154	123	"A  woman walks into the City Centrelink  office,
trailed  by 15 kids . . .
 
'WOW,'  the social worker exclaims, 'Are they ALL  yours?'

 
 
 'Yeah,  they are all mine,' the flustered mother  sighs,
having  heard that question a thousand times  before.
She says, 'Sit down Terry.' All the  children rush to
find  seats.

'Well,' says the social worker,  'then you must be
here  to sign up. I'll need all your children's  names.'
 
'This  one's my oldest - he is Terry.'
'OK, and  who's next?'
'Well,  this one, he is Terry, also.'
The social  worker raises an eyebrow  but
continues.  One by one, through the  oldest
four,  all boys, all named Terry.

Then she is  introduced to the eldest  girl,
named  Terri.
'All right,' says the caseworker. 'I'm  seeing
a  pattern here. Are they ALL named  Terri?'
 
Their  Mother replied, 'Well, yes - it makes  it
easier.  When it is time to get them out of  bed
and  ready for school, I yell, 'Terry!' An'  when
it's  time for dinner, I just yell 'Terry!' an'  they
all  come runnin.' An' if I need to stop the  kid
who's  running into the street, I just yell  'Terry'
and  all of them stop. It's the smartest  idea
I  ever had, namin' them all  Terry.'
 
The  social worker thinks this over for a bit,  then
wrinkles  her forehead and says tentatively,  'But
what  if you just want ONE kid to come, and  not
the  whole bunch

An exclusive poll conducted specifically for us since we were the highest bidder has revealed that Western Sydney has not yet been talked about enough by the news. 

 * Photo of young white family * 

Dave and Jacinta, a family of battlers, are concerned about Labor's messy reforms of the superannuation taxation policy and compulsory increase, primarily because they do not understand the concept in the first place. 

""I mean, I keep hearing about this money, but it's not going in me account each week,"" says Dave, 29, who works as an unlicensed tradesman in the Western Suburbs, and agreed to speak to us if we bought his round.

Dave is not alone in his doubts. Less than 4 in 10 of the blokes we asked around the bar said that they trusted the current government to deliver on whatever it is they were asked about.

Jacinta is more concerned about welfare for her young family. 

""I'm really worried they might cut the baby bonus,"" she says, in between puffs on her Winfield Blues. 

Jacinta is 7 months pregnant with her third child, and at home her son Warnie, 3, and her daughter Fruity-Lexia, 14 months, are placing a deal of pressure on the household budget.

Jacinta plans to invest the payment for the next child into necessary upgrades for transportation. 

""Yeah, nah, the Commodore hasn't had a new stereo in yonks.""

In Blacktown RSL, voters are more worried about the possibility of Labor ruining the Ashes for the upcoming series in England.

""All I know is that whenever the Coalition is in power, we tend to be better at cricket,"" said Stuart, 47, whose interest in politics predominantly relies around whether it might influence things he can bet on.

They wanted sick leave for casuals and total government control of education and private enterprise. They wanted money. And none of them had half a clue about how good we have it in Australia.

I spoke to a man that called Tony Abbott ""hitler in clergy robes"". Another called the Anzus treaty international sovereign slavery. I met a lady who told me that the world must submit to socialism or else no one will have any money. Another called me a bastard and a villain when I said I dismissed a casual worker for being crap at his job under workchoices.

There were others - rational people arguing for a carbon tax, and the humane treatment of refugees. I agreed with those people, because they seemed to understand that the government is not a charity. It's a body that works to provide citizens land rights, uphold freedom, protect those citizens, and facilitate the ability to pursue happiness. 

There is a fundamental disconnect here. Australia is not America. We must be fighting for an Australian cause, not an American one. We need to stimulate personal involvement in politics, and keep our government accountable, productive, sustainable and humane.

/rant

edit; this has way moer upvotes than it should, guys, seriously. I just went down there, talked to some people, asked to many questions to a few and felt smug, arrogant and rant-y on the tram home so I wrote this out. I doubt the whole thing's be a big deal by next friday, anyway.

If I was running the protests, my main points would be:

- Housing affordability and the associated tax
- Humane treatment of refugees
- Making sure the carbon tax stays in legslation
- Anger at the lack of a mining tax
- Vocal distaste for Andrew Bolt and the IPA.

We can assume that this story has not reached mainstream due to the supposed level of secrecy afforded with government assistance. 

Now, I am no crusader, and don't wish to be, and in light of [the latest wikileaks cable regarding iiNet and MPA and the US Embassy](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/or3wj/australia_wikileaks_cables_revealed_us_embassy/), SOPA, and our own internet type filtery bill in parliament, why has this not received more attention?

Prima Face, this looks like the start of our own underhanded internet control that the government and the entertainment industry are trying to sneak past the radar.

I am no expert on this and am no way informed so ITT can we get more information and opinion on this, and if I am way off, don't ridicule, tell me why.

1373443278.0	1hzuol	I live in Japan and use Fibre. Here are 10 reasons why we need it.	Jatacid	370	69	215	"I have always voted Liberals in the past.  But this year I took a working Holiday to Japan.  

My (tiny) apartment is on fibre running at the same speed as what the NBN will ultimately end up as.

Here are 10 reasons why I'll be voting for the labor party, despite the fact that the party is a mess and krudd is back in the seat and that they've made so many mistakes.

~~

1. Fibre is future proofed to the best of our current technologies and the years of viability we get from it cause the overall costs to be quite tangible for such a large scale development.  Yes, it's a lot of money.  But it's necessary too.

2. Wifi is not feasible for a country as large as Australia with such a low population density.  A country like Japan are looking into wifi technologies which can viably compete with a ground network, however they have the population to support the technology.  This leaving ground-networks as Australia's only feasible option.

3.  A copper upgrade proposed by the liberals will provide barely any discernable benefit to current connections and is thus (in the grander scheme of things) entirely wasted money within 5 years.  Australia needs a new ground network, fiber is the best way for that to happen.

4.  Fiber has the ability to be utilized better since it transmits light.  In Japan they're already researching a way to make light travel in a 'tornado' which increases bandwith tenfold on the same line.  This kind of thing means in the future the network will still be viable only by changing the nodes.  This can't happen with copper and in a few years we'll be at the same point as we are now.

5.  It's not about downloading game of thrones faster even though it may at first be the only thing you can think of how you'd benefit from such speeds.  It actually changes how you use the internet completely.  Subconciously you avoid clicking links if it will take more than 4 seconds to load a page.  You don't click on videos, you won't upload pictures if you have to leave in 5 minutes.  Fiber speeds completely change that, using the internet feels 'freer' and is conducive to productivity and sharing

6.  Freedom to upload, means you can share files you previously wouldn't have been able to.  The most 'consumer'-type would be high megapixel photographs or videos.  But you can also share full-brain scans worth terrabytes of data on the cloud.  The industry is able to share this information with all the scientists around Australia INstantly.  Imagine giving that info to new students at uni and seeing what they can discover.

7.  The NBN is a single policy that, since the Liberals have completely outruled it, will effectively change the future of our country.  Now, more than ever it's important to vote for policies rather than the idiots running the show.

8.  I am just a casual internet user.  I don't download things, I don't watch many videos. I share some photos but thats about it.  Using Fiber changes how i've used internet completely and I can see how in a few years more services will capitalize on it.

9.  Being able to get information like television on demand is also the next frontier of media.  Right now with fiber you can be watching an episode of game of thrones, your phone could ring silently in the other room, a message can pop up on your screen and let you politely know it's ringing and if you want to answer then and there or if you want to send them a message.  Your household is wholly connected, and more and more devices are able to work in harmony with it.

10. I know this is politics, so whenever you read something biased you'll always naturally try to discount and counter justify.  All I have to say as my last point is that, I am using Fibre RIGHT NOW.  In a country renowned for being ahead in technology.  In my limited, and casual usage of the internet, with at first glance, no direct 'need' for speeds as fast as the NBN, it has completely changed how I use the internet.  And this is only the beginning.  I can see first hand.  Australia really does need this."	t5_2qh8e	True

Back in the US, people are arrogant and rude as a rule. Here, people are much more likely to be friendly. I've been greeted with ""G'day, mate!"" by strangers more times than I can count, and I'd always thought that phrase was just a product of pop culture!

Now, I know Australia has its problems just like any other country, but my first impression after a month has been overwhelmingly positive. Please continue to be awesome and I promise I'll come back some day.

Just astounding stuff. Everyone claims that this guys policies are his saving grace and yet, when he's asked a direct question about them, all he can do is smite his opposition. I'm still seriously convinced Abbott is just Sacha Baron Cohen in disguise, working on a new 'Borat' style film.

1305694855.0	hdz1l	A short story on how I took down a Trading Post Phishing scheme today.	xrobau	333	56	53	"One of the guys I work with has a car for sale on Tradingpost.com.au, and recieved a SMS saying 'You have won the Tradingpost $500 gift award, visit http://tradingpost-sms.com.au to collect'. -- or something like that.

A couple of minutes later, he called me into his office, and showed me the website. It looked _perfect_, totally indistinguishable from the real tradingpost website - even the 'Free to browse' down the bottom. 

The page he had open was asking him for his Tradingpost username, password, address, and credit card number.

Luckily, he works in IT too, and is well aware of phishing. He showed me the page and said 'What's wrong with this?' - it wasn't a https connection. 

That was it. That was the only thing that triggered a 'something's wrong here' thought. It was immaculately done. (it was actually using iframes to grab the real tradingpost site, and only the bit asking for the password was hosted elsewhere).

Anyway, it was *so* good that I had to do a bit of aggressive takedown action.  I immediately reported it to all the phishing sites, and then started looking harder into it.   The machine it was running on was in China. Nothing I can do there.  But, it turns out they had registered the .com.au domain name with NetRegistry. 

That was their first mistake. Registering a .com.au domain needs a fair bit of 'stuff' behind it. A real person, a company, an ABN.   I did a bit of looking around. Turns out that the company they'd picked the ABN for (because it had 'Trading' in the name, I guess) had actually shut down in 2007.  Bingo!

I got in touch with Netregistry via their abuse@ email address, and luckily enough, the phishers were hosting the DNS with NetRegistry so NR could remove the redirect immediately.  After a couple more back and forth emails (and a quick message to auDA) I showed NR that they had registered this domain incorrectly (it was registered on Monday) against a company that had shut down.

This is the response I got from them:

&gt; I'll also request our Developer team to review the auto-approvals of registrations for ABNs which are matched at ABR. What appears to be happening is that we're not checking the validity of the ABN, but only an existence of the record at ABR, whereas we need to include a check for whether the ABN is current additionally.

&gt; Once the secondary check is in place, we'll be automatically stopping attempts with expired ABNs.

&gt; Thank you for highlighting this issue to me by your research on this domain.

OMG. A company that actually cares, realises there's a problem, and then says they're going to fix it.  This. Is. Awesome.

They're now going to revoke the registration (auDA policies win, again!), and fix it so it can't happen again. 

So, bad luck to the Scammers, I guess. They had the misfortune to get an Infosec professional involved with their scam pretty much as soon as it started. Good try though.

Anyway, for future reference, if you ARE a scammer, here's couple of tips:  

Firstly, Use a SSL Certificate when you're asking for someone's credit card number. Really, they cost like $10. That would have given you a good couple of of weeks before people realised that they'd been scammed, and I probably wouldn't have been called in at all. People *know* to look for a certificate when they're typing in credit card numbers. Not using one is a big red flag. 

Secondly, good work with the iframes. That looked awesome. Especially the way you grabbed the image Tradingpost used for registration and stuck it on the 'give me your details' page. However, Sensis had caught onto you. The search bar at the top wasn't showing you the (S) logo, and was coming back with a error. I'm guessing they don't allow deep linking of their searchbar. You would have been better to host it yourself.

Apart from that, it was extremely plausible. The 'Enter your code' thing was suspicious, too. You shouldn't have done that in javascript. It should have gone to a script or something on your web server. An *immediate* error was just too suspicious. Real websites go off and check."	t5_2qh8e	True

I'm currently living in Japan and managed to get an x-ray and simple filling done for about $25 (it would be about $80 without public insurance).

My major reason for delaying dental care in the past was the cost (and the fact despite the damage, I had no pain) and with such reasonable prices I no longer have that reason.

Another example (from a blog) was a person who had root canal surgery and a silver crown (porcelain crowns are not covered and cost $800-$1000) over multiple appointments for a total cost of about $70.

* Nothing at all in The Australian or AFR (I checked today)
* Daily Telegraph I presume ignored it too (did anyone read it today?).

Compared to Twitter going nuts with it (See #battleRort or #battleRortMovies tags for instance). 

$900 of Slipper's cab charges = police action and front page mentions.. $9,400 of Abbott's = meh, who cares..

Why is there such a disconnect between the old/mainstream media and the social media?

I'd heard of the concept before. I never paid it much attention to be honest due to a absence of interest in most things political. If I had to disclose my personal political persuasion, I guess I'd say that I lean more towards the left than the right, but have never aligned myself with a particular party or ideology. You might say I'm a swinging voter and in the years since the age of 18, most political parties have been the recipient of my vote at some point in time whether that be state, local or federal politics. I'm a firm believer in ascribing to the politics of being a real human. Some things I have a liberal attitude, others a conservative. I like to think I can weigh a subject on it's own merits. Sure I can be passionate about things I believe in, but politically speaking, I'll approach an issue with logic rather than dogma.

This brings me to my run in with two accounts on reddit.

The first is this individual /u/JS125.  My first encounter with this charming fellow, we had a short discussion about LNP policy which he said he liked. When pressed on what particular policies, he responded,

""You'll see in September - just be patient... Like ALL Labor shills - you demand to know RIGHT NOW!""

Kind of weird statement coming from a punter.  The ""you'll see"" alludes to some insider information; as if he was privy to something that the rest of us aren't.  So I called him on it and I'll be the first to admit, I was kind of a dick about it.

This ultimately lead to [this exchange](http://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/1a0q73/abbott_denies_faith_will_dictate_politics_still/c8tackv?context=3)

When asking for relevance when he asked who I voted for in the last election I was told...

""It goes to your obvious bias....and ultimate lack of character.""

Who goes out of their way to ascribe a lack of character to someone with different political views? Wierd.

Over the following few weeks, I was amongst many who this individual accused of being a ""labor shill"". It was his go to response.  I didn't think much of it at the time until I had another response from an apparently different individual /u/Damocles2010 with a unusual carbon copy ""labor shill"" accusation.

Coincidence?  

Immediately apparent was the presence of a unique formatting style of these two accounts. The inclination towards the liberal use of hyphens in his posts was curious. My suspicions were perked enough after being accused again of being a ""labor shill"". 

So with a spare 10 minutes, armed with Ctrl-F, I opened a window of these two apparently unique user accounts and was surprised when I found some astounding similarities in the accounts.

Both had worked for IBM in the late 70s.  Both professed to be telecommunications engineers. Both had the same LNP talking points, some almost even carbon copies of responses across both accounts. Hmmmm...

So armed with these curious similarities, I laid it all out to my new friend yesterday [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/1azpay/dear_australian_voter_give_me_your_best_reasons/c92km3f?context=3)

My post was met with fierce defiance from Damocles2010.  I was wrong. He had no idea who this other account was. It was I who had created JS125 myself just to imitate Damocles2010 and in fact by confronting him with this information, I was confirming that I was in fact a labor shill! 

Then something even more curious happened.  Within 30 minutes, posts started dissapearing... Damo had deleted most of his posts I had linked. Raised eyebrows followed.  Then perhaps the most damning...  posts of JS125... the account he apparently knew nothing about... started magically disappearing. 

Now, I'm not going to assume that damo/js is part of some grand conspiracy of an external organisation to astroturf /r/australia.  For all I know it could be one guy with a fascination with the LNP that borders on the fanatical.  

I will say however, if you're going to relentlessly call people a [shill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shill), perhaps do a better job at concealing the fact that you may happen to actually be a textbook definition of the thing you're attempting to accuse others of.

TLDR: The butler did it.
