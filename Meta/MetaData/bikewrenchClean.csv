1365660991.0	1c4ccd	I created some videos to help people learn about servicing bicycles. I hope you like them too :) (long video warning)	ahtopahtel	85	10	13	"Alright peoples, its time to beak out your tools and fix up your bikes. Making bicycle repairs is quite simple and saves you quite a few bucks. I've compiled a list of videos I've found that should help you along with your repairs. If you know of any other videos that are excellent, please comment below and I will add them to the list below.

I think most of the videos are 9+ minutes but they go through the points slowly and try to explain all the angles.

Get watching and get repairing :)

EDIT 3:

I've uploaded 4 videos, and I recorded alot of stuff today - hopefully will have 3-4 extra videos go up this weekend :)

Check the list above to see what videos are live.

Also, a big request is feedback - picture quality is one thing, but are the videos useful or are they longwinded?
One more thing - I'm adding links to all the videos so you can skip right to the action if you wish :)

Thanks!

I'm pretty stunned ATM. It is an established shop, lots of history there, sort of a legacy to continue. I mean for a guy like me with no degree, late 40's, stuck in a crap retail job, this is the chance of a lifetime. Everyone I've talked to about it thinks I should go for it, my parents, business-owner friends, roommates.

What would I be getting myself into? I would intern for about a year then buy it, the owner would stay on part-time awhile and be available if I need help. He would let me pay him directly over 5 years for the place. He said that's how he got the place from the guy before him.

I'm fucking freaking out a little right now. He said I'm the only customer he ever let work on his bike back in the shop, I thought he just liked breaking my balls and calling me a Polock, apparently he was seeing if I could do the work or not. I was just grateful to be able to use the stand and bench.

I probably never even would have met the guy if the Schwinn shop had been open 4 years ago when I decided to get back on the bike. This whole thing is scary and karmic."	t5_2sje0	True
1349208106.0	10u0x5	Help! I think I broke my fiancé's bike. I need to fix it before he gets home from work.		60	6	33	"So, I'm not sure if this goes in this subreddit or not but I'm gonna try my luck here. I am almost 20 and haven't ridden a bike since I was around 8. I tried to ride one last year and scraped myself up and decided to say, ""Screw it, I don't need to know how to ride a bike."" But apparently my fiancé wants me to ride bikes with him so I thought it'd be nice if I took his bike while he was at work and teach myself how to ride again as a little surprise. I was doing fine until I had to turn right down a road, lost control and jumped off before I hit the ground. I got back up, realized the chain fell off the front part and put it back on. Everything looks fine. But it will only pedal backwards now. I try to pedal forward and it locks up and nothing will move. I don't know anything about bikes but I need this fixed within the next 5 hours. 

tl;dr Fell off bike, chain came off front. Put chain back on, now pedals will only move backwards, not forwards.

Here's my little step by step method for setting them up, hopefully it helps.

1) bolt the thing on just tight enough to not move when you aren't touching it (preferably this step is done with the chain off, it's a bit easier) 

2) Now move there derailleur up till it has 1-2MM of clearance from top of the teeth on the big ring (I use my fingernail as a gauge) 

3) looking at it from above get the outer plate of the derailleur as perfectly parallel to the middle (with a triple) or big (with a double) chain ring as you can

4) tighten up the derailleur 

If your chain isn't on yet put it on

5) put the rear derailleur into the biggest cog in back and turn the low limit in or out until the inner plate is 2MM off the chain. 

6) drop the rear derailleur into the small cog and bring the front up to the big ring (I usually loosely attach the cable and tug on that to get the derailleur to move over) then set the high limit till you have a MM or so between the outer plate and the chain

7) tighten the cable and give it a few tugs to get the housing to seat 

8) shift into the big ring, and add cable tension until you have the gap between the outer plate and chain again and the derailer is sitting gently against the limit

If everything is line up right your bike SHOULD shift correctly, some playing with tension is required some times to get the thing perfect and some time you will have to move the inner limit in to get the chain to drop down correctly. As long as you don't go off the inside this shouldn't be an issue, on the inside a properly adjust front derailleur is sitting on the limit screw not the cable"	t5_2sje0	True

I like them all for their own respective attributes, but I don't understand when customers are written off the second they bring their bike in and a mechanic sees the pedals turn while they push it towards the service desk. 

None of the guys in my shop do it (thank god for that), but I've seen some really shitty attitudes towards ""those fucking hipster kids who need to get a real bike."" What gives?

I kind of like them, as they're decent customers to us here in DC. Also: 

* their rigs are super easy to fix. Save for the occasional ""how do I turn this amazingly rare/bent-frame/pennyfarthing into a fixie"" crew, the components and repairs are straightforward. Nothing really to adjust or fiddle with except for chain tension and chainline, maybe. 
* sure, lack of brakes can be dangerous, but fewer components makes for a quicker tune-up. We can encourage, even recommend... but we still can't force 'em to buy a front brake. It is what it is. 
* lots of them like bling-y parts; gold cranksets, dura-ace track cogs, multi-color deep-V wheels... these things cost more money than your typical item. I know most of the revenue comes from accessories, but there's a good bit of those they move for us too.

1347432960.0	zr7jm	"A Short Comparison of the Three Editions of ""Zinn &amp; The Art of Road Bike Maintenance"" — For Frugal Shoppers…"	talkingwires	21	1	3	"I bought my first new road bike nine months ago, and as I came to rely on it for day-to-day transportation, I started to look for books to teach myself the art of bike maintenance. Who wants to pay somebody fifty bucks for something you can do yourself with a little bit of education and a few simple tools? I checked out several different books, looked around for others' opinions, and came to the conclusion that [*Zinn &amp; The Art of Road Bike Maintenance*](http://www.amazon.com/Zinn-Art-Road-Bike-Maintenance/dp/1934030422/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=134742934) was the best bet for explaining stuff to newbies with more than enough advanced information to build a bike from the frame up, if you're feeling ambitious.

Why's is this book so great? Brief review: He has two books, one for road bikes, one for mountain bikes. This helps filter out a ton of irrelevant information you find in comprehensive books. The books utilize line drawings and exploded diagrams to show each part and explain how everything fits together instead of photos of one specific bike. He covers all sorts of shifting and braking systems instead of focusing on just one, unlike some of the other recommended books. Each repair is categorized on a three-tiered system based on what tools you need, which I'll paraphrase as ""Essentials You Need to Own a Bike and Should Probably Carry With You on Longer Trips"", ""Hobbyists That Want to be Self-Reliant"", and ""You Could Open Your Own Repair Shop"". And, if you just want the basics, there's a chapter dedicated to maintenance you can do with the most basic of tools, and another about how to deal with mechanical failures on the road when you *don't* have all the tools you need.

(TIL from *Zinn* - If you don't have an extra tube or patch, you can tie the tube into a knot to isolate the puncture. Or, if you have multiple punctures, you can stuff the tire with grass and other padding to limp home without damaging the wheel.)

One criticism: No disc brakes coverage. At all.

*****

So, anyhoo, I headed to [Powell's Books](http://www.powells.com/), and was confronted with three different editions, published in 2000, 2005, and 2009. The earlier ones were used, the latest was only available new, and there was a twenty dollar difference between the three. Which to buy? I had some time to kill, so I sat down with all three editions and spent two hours doing some comparisons. I didn't take notes (what is this a blog?), so I'll try to keep it brief:

All three are solid tomes of bicycle knowledge, and each grows by about fifty pages. But are those extra pages useful? From the first the second edition, absolutely. The first edition seems to be stuck in the eighties, spending more time with parts like threaded stems and outdated braking systems than is really necessary. The second edition still includes the original information, but shifts the newer stuff (which has become the standard) ahead of the older stuff. Many more illustrations are included, and tips from other mechanics have been inserted in sidebars throughout the book or integrated into the text.

The jump from the second to the third edition is much more subtle, and I spent most of my time examining the two, in an effort to save nine bucks. The latest edition has much better typesetting, with no more awkward white space between words in paragraphs. The layout of the pages has also been redesigned, using new fonts, a second color, and white space to make everything much more slick. Unfortunately, that means much of the increased page count comes from the fact that there's less text on a page. There's even some regressions, like losing the chapter title printed on the side of each page so you can quickly thumb through the book to find the section you need.

As for new content in the third edition, there isn't much. There's a couple (literally) of new illustrations, the best being an exploded view of a threadless stem. Some stuff in the frame fitting chapter has been added about UCL regulations. The wheel-building chapter now covers a few alternative ways of arranging your spokes for racing or cyclocross. There's a bit more here and there about carbon fiber forks and frames. Some passages have had a paragraph reworked or inserted, such as the ones about self-sealing tubes and tubeless tires (he mentions other brands besides Slime, now). I even noticed one correction about using citrus-based solvents (they contain water and shouldn't be used for soaking a chain). And the mostly useless, seven-page chapter on bike computers has been dropped.

So, long story short, there just ain't enough added stuff in the latest edition to justify buying it new at full price. A prettier design is about all it has going for it. So, if you're looking for a great book on bicycle maintenance and mechanics, skip the third edition, pick up the second edition of *Zinn &amp; The Art…*, and save yourself some cash."	t5_2sje0	True

It was so bad, it was ruining every ride and causing me several trail side meltdowns. I exhausted all options trying to fix it myself. Took it in to the shop where I bought it, they were stumped also (new pads and larger rotor, Motoex did nothing). They still had my bike and were trying to figure out what to do next.

 So I get a call yesterday: turns out the SRAM rep had stopped into the shop so they showed him my bike. He replaced my entire system (front and rear) withe the new X0 trail brake. New four piston design, levers, rotors, the whole shebang. Installed and adjusted by a factory guy for free. Still in shock here. Plus he gave me the entire old system back too. Just stunned by the level of service I received. I have nothing but the highest praise for Avid now.

I ride my bikes a lot, I ride them hard. But I don't have the tools and equipment to do anything more serious than washing the chain or changing a tire.

But, when I take my bike into the shop because the bottom bracket is creaking, or my wheel is slightly out of true, I feel like I'm getting a bit of attitude - that I should be doing a lot more of the ""basic stuff"" myself.

For example, my 2010 Secteur has developed a creaking noise from in or around the bottom bracket. It might be the bracket itself, but I suspect I need to grease the speedplay pedals. Problem is, this requires either ordering special tools and grease online or else getting the LBS to do it.

And, as for the bottom bracket itself, it's pretty clear that Specialized doesn't want me pulling the cranks myself - the bolt is covered with an odd dust cover that looks like I need yet another special tool to remove.

So my bike had been rattling especially when going over bumps and such. I thought it was the rear wheel but after checking it was fine the noise was still there.

Today I flipped the bike upside down with the seat post out and loads of this weird material came out (see pics). It's a black plastic type material that looks to be weaved like carbon. My frame however is aluminium (Planet X Superlight). The larger parts seemed to match the curve of the frame.

Quite a lot came out and every time I righted the bike and flipped it again more came out. 

There were lots of smaller shards of this stuff near the top of the seat stay on the inside.

I have done a couple of builds myself and know my way around wrenches, but this being a Di2 I let the experts handle it...or so I thought. I have studied the relevant chainsuck guides I could find and checked off every item on the suspect list: chain and chainring (11 spd Specialized sworks) are flawless - well lubricated and no visible defects.
Chainsuck happens when I downshift from the large chainring while in the second largest cog in the cassette. Has anyone experienced this with the new Di2 11 spd?
My only lead: I noticed that the rear derailleur tension was not very high, is it possible that my mechanic missed something that accounts for the wimpy pull?
Also, what should I be looking for in terms of damage in case of chainsuck? I have some cosmetic damage to the chainstay, but should I be worried about the derailleurs derailleur hanger? In case the shop did screw this up I plan on asking for replacement parts.
This fatal flaw is heartbreaking, I cannot bear sawing into the frame and cranking the derailleurs once more. Also, I am concerned that this is unusual enough that the guys at the shop won't invest the time to get it right; time is money and they have more bikes to build.

Did one of the front a while back and had a request to do the rear, finally getting around to it

This works better starting with the chain off, but it can be done with the chain on

1) Bolt on the derailleur 

2) Looking at the derailleur from above and behind the cassette set the high limit till the top and bottom jockey wheel lines up perfectly (this is where it helps to have the chain off) 

3) push the derailleur all the way over to the easiest gear and push it all the way against the stop. Again line up the jockey wheels with the big cog. 

4) put the chain on (put it in big big and make sure it has a bit of slack) 

5) put the bike in the small chain ring and again push the derailleur over to the small cog 

6) now take the B tension screw (the one that pushes against the hanger and rocks the derailleur back) till you have a full link between the jockey wheel and cassette. Note! At this point your derailleur is adjusted if your having shifting issues it is all cable tension, unless you bend something DO NOT touch the screws on the derailleur, it will only screw things up

 7) hook up the cable (shimano and campy derailleurs like to be taught, and sram derailleurs like a bit of slack)

 8) at this point start shifting up and down, if it's slow going up into an easier gear, add a click of tension on the barrel adjuster. If it's slow going into a smaller cog take a click off. Just play with this till your shifting is perfect.

Hope this helps, let me know if ya'll need any clarification

1372705150.0	1hfywt	Measured and adjusted my chain according to Sheldon Brown technique but this does not look right. Is this safe?	chubbykipper	18	2	33	"Ok, been a bike owner for two years, dabble in repairs but by no means am I knowledgable (trying to learn).

So my chain comes off the chainring (8 gears at rear, one gear at front, no front derailleur) at the slightest provocation, a bad bump or changing gears when going fast. Most days I have to put my chain back on the chainring twice per journey (it also always bounces off to the right, to the outside of the bike, getting stuck in the chainguard - [here's a pic](http://imgur.com/0t68msX) ). It's killing me softly.

I figured it might be too long, as it seems to bounce and wobble quite a bit when riding.

So I checked with Sheldon Brown [here](http://sheldonbrown.com/derailer-adjustment.html#chain) and watched [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9YEcgQRHpA) video, and set about correcting my chain length. As a result I took off about four or five links. The result just seems utterly wrong.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/fLtrYCe.jpg) is my rear derailleur in the highest gear,

and [here](http://i.imgur.com/nMYUWqz.jpg) in the lowest gear.

Some wheels that have QR levers have a threaded rod that is used as an axle support. The threading and the length are perfectly matched to your hanger. You can remove the QR axle and screw the wheel into the hanger hole.

Seems to me that at the Red/DuraAce/record level (and maybe even one step down from that) concessions are being made for weight that *have* to shorten lifespan, yeah?  

What's the workhorse (integ. shifting) gruppo that compromizes everything else for *durability* instead of for *weight*?

Looking especially for opinions from mechanics who have seen many different groupsets in many different stages of wear.  If you (like me) only have experience riding on 2-4 different groupsets with one type of riding style... well, we might not have the insight to weigh in on this.

I've done some browsing but much of the information I find is either too conflicting to be trusted, or too low level for my limited knowledge.

Ideally I'd like to understand how to adjust and fine tune my front and rear derailleur safely and know the pitfalls and common problems.

Recently fitted a new chain and it's currently catching on the pulley which has prompted this post. I’d like to have a stab at fixing myself before accepting defeat and taking it to the experts!

edit: guys, thanks for all your tips. I had another try last night and seem to have gotten a little further but the following problems remain (sorry for terrible quality phone pics)

1. Middle of cassette, middle chainring - all looks aligned and sounds good when I turn the crank arms
http://imgur.com/NLsue

2. If I move to the largest chainring, and second smallest cog on the cassette, the chain rubs on the front der - only slightly though
http://imgur.com/SxOjs

3. And if I shift to the front and rear largest cogs, the chain catches on the rear pulley and even seems to go off at an angle (not sure if you can see from pics - again sorry for poor quality) I guess this is not a combination I'd often be using but all the same doesn't seem right
http://imgur.com/skFBi

4. And finally (no picture for this one) If i shift to the smallest cog on the cassette, the pulleys seem to be too far over towards the chainstay and are not in line with the cogs (H-Limit?)

I had a run in with a difficult customer and I'm interested in hearing reddit's feedback.

The way we operate is to walk the customer through the repairs, explain along the way, and let them use the tools to practice technique, in hopes that they'll gain some insight into the requirements of bike maintenance and be better bike owners. This dude comes in with an aluminum schwinn something or other from Kmart (he told me where he bought it) with a click in the bottom bracket. I examined the bb and couldn't see anything obviously wrong, except that the lockring on the adjustable cup was loose, but the cup wasn't loose or tight, so I guessed bad pitting or broken bearings and set to work pulling it apart for a rebuild.

I pulled the driveside crank myself, explaining to him all the ins and outs and what to watch for so that he didn't strip the crank on the other side. This guy was kind of oafish and immediately set to work tearing threads. I stopped him as quick as I could, but he had already ruined the first couple threads and when I pulled the tool out I saw that he had cross threaded it to begin with. My coworker and I tried two or three other crank pullers, getting as much purchase as we could on the remaining threads, but the crank was seized and going nowhere, probably severely overly torqued by the mechanic at Kmart, as many of those bikes are.

Stuck in a hard place (and not having one of [these](http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y21/dissident75/Misc%20Bike%20Parts/crank_puller.jpg) in the shop, which we need), we took the pickle fork to it for a couple whacks, being extremely careful not to touch the frame. No luck. Finally I found I was able to get a pair of long needle nose on the cup threads and with a lot of crunching of the cup, I unthreaded it and pulled the crank out with the bb spindle still attached.

I spent the next 30 minutes digging through parts bins to find a matching bb and useable crankset and as I installed them he asked what this was going to cost. I told him we charged $10/hr for the shop time and with the components, how was $30? And then he revealed himself to be a dick. He said his crankset was perfectly good when he came in and that I had ruined it, so he wasn't going to pay for it, and all the extra time was my fault (even though the crank puller was in his hand when the problem started.) I told him he was being unreasonable, that like it or not, Kmart bikes are not designed to be repaired and we do our best, but frankly that's just the nature of the game when you shop at department stores. He refused to pay any more than $10, so I pulled his bike out of the stand and kicked him out. He came back 10 minutes later and said that I hadn't finished the job because the new cranks didn't line up with the front derailleur. I told him that we don't do work for free and when he refused to pay, he forfeited his right to service. He made a scene in front of the shop for five minutes and finally left.

What would others have done? I probably shouldn't have let him use the crank puller, but that's kind of in the mission of our organization. We're reminded all the time by the shop manager not to do all the work for customers, to let them use the tools. Was I unreasonable? Has anyone else been in a similar situation? I don't feel great about it, but like I said, it was a tough situation.

I've been doing really basic stuff on my bikes for a few years and generally consider myself somewhat mechanical. Taught myself most of what I know from reading Zinn and the Art of Road Bike Maintenance, so planning on using that, Park Tool, and YouTube as a guide.

I have a decent of tools, although planning on investing in some of more specialized stuff I don't have yet, torque wrench, BB tool, chain whip, casette tool, etc.

Thinking about getting [this frame](http://www.nashbar.com/bikes/Product_10053_10052_511702_-1___202389) and some mid-level components.

* What are the trickiest parts? Anything that was unexpectedly tricky?

* Anything noobs tend to frequently fuck up?

* Seems like people suggest having the LBS press on the headset, although the frame is machined for an integrated headset, seems like only the lower race needs to be pressed on to the fork, and everything else just slips on with no need for a press?

* Someone also suggested having the LBS install the BB, so that they can face and chase the threads, how necessary is that?

* Cutting cable housing, is this worth having the LBS do? I have a park tool cable and housing cutter, but it sounds like it might be tricky not to crush the ends of the housing?

* Wheel building, seems a little bit little black art, anyone have any experience learning and/or recommendations on adding learning that on to this project vs just buying a decent set of pre-built wheels?

I've folllowed the Avid method for aligning the pads and calipers, and also I tried another method, here: http://www.ecovelo.info/2011/04/15/a-foolproof-method-for-adjusting-avid-bb5-disc-brakes/

I've managed to get my front brake setup perfect.
My back brake however I can't get lined up.  The inboard pad I can get lined up with the disc, however the outboard pad, for the life of me (so far anyways) I cannot get lined up.  It's always settling into an angled position relative to the disc and the caliper.  As a result, I'm finding it impossible to remove the rubbing.

I can't see anything inside the caliper that'd be causing a problem (granted it's hard to get a good look).

I wanted to get this up in case anyone has immediate thoughts.  If necessary I can try to get a picture up later this evening.

I'm hoping maybe someone has BB5 experience on this sort of a problem.
For what it's worth, this is on a 2012 Specialized Tricross frame.



And to nip it in the bud, I know, BB7s are better... I'll upgrade to those at a later date likely.

EDIT: Photo: http://imgur.com/6Xt8S
I drew red lines through the grips on the pads so you can see the angle problem.
I worked at it some more, and still haven't solved it, but I backed off the cable tension to allow it to run without rubbing.  It just makes the brake cable more slack than I'd like.  I think unless someone here has any other suggestions, I'll be taking it to the bike shop to get them to investigate, correct and hopefully tell me how to fix it in the future if I come across it again.

On a plus note, I adjusted my front derailleur as it was too high up and how the front shifts oh so sweet :)

FOLLOWUP: In case anyone is still reading ;)  I took it to the bike shop. It's still a bit wonky but they seemed to have tuned the tension and such better than I.  Ultimately they said they've seen this in bb5s and it seems the pads often don't like to sit the way they're supposed to due to the design.  Basically it was suggested that I expect rub on it (beyond that of normal rotor warping due to usage) or upgrade to bb7s as they are better designed.  Anyhow, it's workable for now."	t5_2sje0	True

I know nothing about materials or rear wheels and I'm hoping you guys can help me. Cost isn't a massive problem, I'd rather shell out $$ and get a good product and i never have this problem again.

Additional Information:-

I cycle 8 miles a day on a flat route along a canal in London. (So it's not an extreme route)

My bike is a mountain bike hybrid. (check link above).

I'm around 22st last time i checked.


I'd be very grateful if you guys could help me out or point me in the right direction.

Thanks.

1340101863.0	v9r5s	UPDATE: Lubricating and Servicing Old Three-Speeds	SocratesDiedTrolling	16	0	18	"A few weeks ago (man, has it really been that long?) I started into a personal, recreational, educational project, rebuilding an old three-speed someone had discarded. I came to you fine persons for suggestions on how to work on old three-speed hubs. I found your responses encouraging and helpful. Some said they would like to see pics of the completed rebuild, so here is an imgur gallery: [My Free Spirit (Sears) FS3, step-through, three-speed rebuild](http://imgur.com/a/l8h5x).

Given how uncommon they are, and how little info is left on them, I plan to post a video soon about how to disassemble, lube, and re-assemble these early Shimano hubs. They are very similar in principal to the more popular Sturmey-Archers, but are shifted in the opposite direction; in an SA, the shift cable pulls the mechanism to the right against a spring, whereas in the Shimano it actuates a push-rod which pushes the mechanism to the left against a spring. So, once I edit up my video and post it, I'll update it here.

So, thanks for the help, guys!


**UPDATE (1 day later):** I'm a horrible self-recording cameraman, and I'm not much better at editing, but I've uploaded a couple of videos on servicing the Shimano S3 hub. Shimano had a good number of models, and not all of them had the same parts. (In fact, that's a big part of why I'm doing this; I couldn't find any exact descriptions of this hub online.) So, your mileage may vary. [Video 1: Disassembly and Lubrication (10min)](http://youtu.be/cOKrYVss2Ew) | [Video 2: Reassembly (8min)](http://youtu.be/3dM6FWo7IB8)"	t5_2sje0	True

**UPDATE**

I emailed a few frame builders in town with the image that I posted here and estimates varied quite a bit. I ended up going with a frame builder a couple miles from me who charged $100 to fix both seat stays. He also fixed the seat tube so that I can fit a non-lathed 27.2mm seat post now.

[**IMGUR ALBUM OF WELDED FRAME**](http://imgur.com/a/9WKJ3)

For those curious, here's what a couple builders emailed me after seeing the picture I sent:

*Quote #1:*

&gt; Thanks for your inquiry. We can certainly repair your bike. Looking at the photo, your drive side is cracked on both the inboard and outboard fillets, the non-drive side is likely also cracked or about to be. Completely stripping the paint will allow us to examine the frame and locate any other potential problem areas.

&gt; $50 to strip the paint

&gt; $200 labor to repair the stays

&gt; $250 total without paint

&gt; We can provide options for repainting, from $150 and up depending on what you'd like to do in terms of color and decals/graphics.

&gt; Please let me know if you would like to schedule the work. We are currently 12-16 weeks out on repairs at this time.

*Quote #2:*

&gt; Without seeing it in person, I think there are two approaches you could take to repair it. 
1. Quicker and less costly - Disassemble the frame, sand off the paint around the area, lay some silver down over the cracks, rattle can the area with white gloss paint. 
Around $180.
2. Restoration - Disassemble it, strip the paint, replace the seatstay, repaint. This one depends a lot on paint choices but figure on at least $600. 

&gt; There is, of course, the third option of deciding that it has lived a full life and hanging it in the stable or moving its components to another frame.

Lately I've been taking my comfort commuter on longer and longer journeys. However it is not a road bike, and after 3 hours I'm really feeling it. What is needed is a road bicycle!

I'm not made of money, and I like the idea of buying a cheap second hand frame and doing it up during the winter (I'm in NZ, winter is coming). However I have more questions than I know what to do with. We don't really have the bike culture like other countries have, so there isn't a co-op I can go to in order to learn these things.

I'm looking at spending a few of hundred bucks on this. While I know if I were in the US, or even Australia, I would be able to get a new entry level road bike for that money, in NZ you can't get anything under a grand. I think that there are some importers in my country laughing all the way to the bank, but that's neither here nor there.

I have zero experience with this sort of thing. I want to do it myself as I can save on labour and pick up a skill at the same time. Also having a project keeps the winter blues away.

My googlefu is lacking. [This](http://www.carectomy.com/buy-used-road-bike/) website gave me some general tips, but what I want is nuts and bolts stuff. I also am looking for some wisdom on what to avoid, what to look for, and any other knowledge that you can only get from people who have done it themselves.

When the bike reached around 2000 miles I started getting a clicking noise coming from the BB when I would put a lot of pressure on the pedal. eventually it started making a noise with every revaluation. I took the bike to my mechanic and he tried to just tighten the bottom bracket but that didn't resolve the issue. The mechanic told me that the BB was shot and if I wanted the click noise to go away I would have to replace it. He suggested that I ride the bike until the problem got worse and replace it later... I'm anal about clicking so I went hunting for a new part! 


So, I found a friend that upgraded his bike and had an extra Gxp bottom bracket with only a few hundred miles. I swapped it out pretty easily but about 500 miles later the clicking came back. 

my friend that gave me the bottom bracket thinks that either something is wrong with the spindle ( don't know the proper term) on my crank set or something is wrong with the threading for the BB on the frame causing it to come loose over time

UPDATE: Thanks for all the tips! I changed the tube, made sure to check everything very carefully but I didn't find anything uneven. When I pumped it up to ~115PSI, it exploded. The new hole is a few inches from where the old tube had its hole, but both of them are at the side of the tube, roughly in the area where rim and tire meet.

I'm a big guy (330lbs) and seem to keep breaking spokes on the rear wheel every few weeks.

Do heavy duty spokes exist? 

I haven't checked to see if the same spokes are breaking, that is, the ones that got repaired. I had the bike for quite some time before I broke the first spokes, since then, its been more frequent. I keep taking it to the same bike shop. I'm just wondering if they're using cheaper spokes. There was never any conversation about what spokes they could use to repair it. To be on the safe side, I'm taking it to a different bike shop today.

UPDATE: I want to thank everyone for contributing. I took the wheel to Cactus Bike in Chandler and had them do a standard rebuild, with labor, spokes and a wrench, the total came to $85. My commute is about 40 miles/week, and they said that should be a sufficient break in period before readjustments should be made. I'm going to be taking it back in and the wheel builder is going to re-true it and go over some basicmaintenance and show me what to look for when I'm doing my periodic inspections.

Any and all guidance appreciated. 		13	0	8	"A fraternity at my college did something really cool and hosted a timed 'build a bike' competition with some Walmart kids bikes for our local chapter of Big Brothers, Big Sisters.


I know, I know, *Walmart*. But these guys aren't bike-nerds, and its a really cool idea, and mostly worked really well.

I've heard that its a good idea to grease all threaded parts on a bicycle before assembly but I don't think I've been told why. I think its so when you remove parts for service, they'll actually come apart. Is this true?

I think I've seen why with pedals where I actually stripped off the threads from a crank arm because the threads weren't greased.
But wouldn't this make parts that shouldn't come apart, like a lockring threaded against a fixed gear cog, slip off more easily?

[This site](http://bicyclemechanic.blogspot.com/2009/04/bicycle-grease-oils-cleansers-and.html) says that one shouldn't use automotive grease because its too thick, but I don't really see why that would be a problem. I feel the force from riding on the bottom brakcet and hubs would eliminate any concerns like these. Why am I wrong?

It also says one shouldn't use oils like wd40 (obviously, it evaporates and leaves you no lubricant) and 3 in 1 (not so obvious). Whats wrong with 3 in 1? Why does it say oils are essential for threads when I thought I should be greasing threads? Why is tri-flow generally considered better for chains than 3 in 1? I hear its because of gumming but all oils seem to gum eventually...

A friend of mine gave me his old bike to fix and the frame has some rusty spots. My intention is to sell it afterwards (I already have too many bikes) so I don't want to do a whole repaint job, as I consider that to be too expensive, but I'd still like to remove some of the rusty spots.

Rear tire slides against rear brake hindering movement slightly

I was doing about 20 mph, tried to bunny hop, and hit them hard ... BANG! My bars dipped down about 2"" and I almost bit it.  So I stopped to torque the bars, and not having a torque wrench in the field, I went too far and crushed the carbon handlebar.  That was a long, sad ride home. 

Fast forward to today, I ordered a replacement Zipp aluminum bar and torqued it to spec (4 Nm for 4-bolt pattern w/blue loctite) in the stem.  I put all my weight on them and they didn't slip.  

Soooo hit the same tracks and the bar dipped AGAIN.   WTF? I used Tacx carbon paste on the original carbon bars, and no paste on the aluminum bars.  Both sets of bars have the ""grip tape strip"" and were torqued to spec. 

What gives?  This is really crushing my confidence.  We have a lot of bumpy roads around here, and I just attack the bumps like cobbles (fast) so i need to feel confident. 

Question 1: Should I be riding on the hoods or drops over major bumps or tracks?  Perhaps it's just too much weight on the hoods (downward rotation pressure) I prefer hoods for group riding, but switch to drops for more leverage when sprinting.  I don't like to ride the drops for long, I always end up back on my hoods. 

Question 2: I am thinking it's my stem ... it's a specialized 2-strip (4 bolt) clamp that doesn't have a lot of surface area. I am thinking about ordering a bigger stem with more surface area for clamping. Has anyone ever heard of this happening?

I bought some new bearings, cleaned up the hub components, and re-greased the bearings and cup. I spent a while getting the cones screwed in at the correct point, without too much resistance or play.

I was well prepared so I quickly changed the tube, but when I started to pump up the tube I noticed that a big bulge was forming around the valve. So big that it didn't fit inside the brake, even though the tube was still soft and the brake was open.

I opened the valve and tried again, but the bulge was still there. As I was quite close to home I pumped up the tube as far as it would without touching the brakes, and then slowly paddled the last 4/5 km home.

So I'm wondering, what would cause this? Was it just a bad tube (it was a Continental from my LBS, so seems unlikely), or did I do something wrong?

I've seen bulges like this before, but they wouldn't be noticeable until you'd take the tube out of the tire, so they weren't that big.

Another related question, do you normally fix a puncture (when you get home), or do you not bother and throw away the tube? I used to ride a city-bike where I'd easily fix a tube 5/6 times before replacing it, but there I never pumped them really hard, and I only just the bike for casual commuting. Now I've got a race bike I'm not sure if fixing it is even worth it, as I'm worried that it'd increase the chance of another puncture a lot.

EDIT: Was trying to find the cause just now and pumped the tire up outside the tire, and the bulge showed up right away, even bigger. Pumped it to about 2 bar maybe, tried pinching it on a few different spots, and then it exploded. As in, not a little tear but it's ripped apart at the spot where the bulge used to be."	t5_2sje0	True
1370148230.0	1fi5yx	Small question about how the chain should be routed through the derailleur pulleys.	cooper12	13	1	18	"Hey everyone. I got a new chain today at my LBS, who I won't hesitate to say I dislike. I was trying to fix a stiff link but the chain tool broke and I ended up using my bike as a scooter to get to it since it was the closest bike shop. 

Now, the chain works fine and my gears shift fine. (Fine is very subjective here as I've only ridden this bike 3 times so I can't really get a natural feel for how things should be and I just replaced a decade old chain.) The thing is, I noticed that my chain was routed a different way through the pulleys. 

What I mean by pulleys: http://i.imgur.com/ffgSaML.png

How it looked before: http://i.imgur.com/T5j2wwI.png

How it looks now: http://i.imgur.com/GXmzplN.png

My main guess for why the mechanic decided to put the chain through this way is that the chain he had wasn't long enough or he was trying to be cheap and save some links. I tried researching the purpose of the pulleys and the most I really got was that they: 

&gt; regulate the tension of the chain as it runs over different sized sprockets
 
So if I read correctly, the pulleys have to do with shifting and they seem kinda important too. The way my chain is going through the pulleys now, it looks like the only function they are serving is to hold the chain. 

**My Question/TL;DR**: Is it normal for a chain to be routed through the pulleys the way it currently is on my bike? Am I at a disadvantage in respect to shifting gears or drivetrain efficiency? 

**Edit:** So, thanks to /u/Zekohl , I found out that it was actually in the correct alignment. Like he said in his post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/bikewrench/comments/1fi5yx/small_question_about_how_the_chain_should_be/cabf3y4?context=3), its different seeing your bike in a higher gear. When I got it back my bike was shifted higher and later on my friend shifted it to the largest sprocket for me so the pulleys were nearly horizontal. At the time I thought the way it was, was wrong. I really should've double checked before posting. I'll be more careful in the future in self-diagnosing problems and jumping to blame the mechanic. Thanks a lot for your help guys! :)

1369872097.0	1faxnt	Advice on roadbike maintenance and other questions	kyleisntwild	14	2	9	"So I ride [this sweet Trek 460](http://i.imgur.com/KsVRzFY.jpg) from the 80s.  I got the bike from my neighbor about 2 years ago, and I have been riding it ever since.  There was an issue with the freewheel when I first got it, so I had the back wheel replaced right away, but I have had no issues otherwise.  

I really want to take care of this bike since I ride it so much, but I don't really know how to handle preventitive maintenance.  I have some downtime this week so I want to do as much work on it as I can to get it in shape for summer.  

I have a crank puller, a chain breaker, good bike grease, tri-flow lube, and access to general tools.  


I am looking for any and all **advice on how to take care of it**, and I also have some **specific questions to ask you guys**:  


First, there are some places where the paint has chipped away.  These spots looked more or less like this when I got the bike, and I have done nothing about it so far.  Here are some pictures:

http://i.imgur.com/ocwLiUQ.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/4XbFO3f.jpg


What should I do about spots like these to stop the corrosion and keep everything solid?  


I have noticed most other road bikes have rubber brake hoods.  Am I missing some kind of covering that I should replace or are mine fine like this?

http://i.imgur.com/ttcaGA1.jpg  


The bartape is definitely getting grungy, I took off one side of it already, going to unwrap the otherside right before I try and put the new tape on so I can try and emulate it as closely as possible.  Looks like there is a lot of tape/glue gunk on the bar from over the years, do I need to scrub this stuff off or is it fine to just put my new tape right over it?  

http://i.imgur.com/l84xIuY.jpg  


Since I have been using this bike regularly for 2 years, and I know it has been ridden hard in the past (triathalons and such), I am taking this week as an oppurtunity to replace the chain and brake/shifter cables.  I know these are parts that wear fast, and they are so inexpensive I figured why not. Plus I already have the grip tape off.  I've never replaced cables for downtube shifters or these kind of brakes, but I am assuming its pretty straight forward. Good idea?  


I already took the crank off to give the chainrings a proper cleaning, and I plan to do the same for the rear cogs.  I noticed the teeth on the chainrings seem kind of worn, how do I know how much wear is too much wear?

(pic soon)  


I plan on giving the frame a good wipe down and cleaning the derailleurs as best I can, but I think I am going to leave them on to do it.  That way I will only need to do minor adjustments to get everything working smoothly.  Is it a good idea to take the seatpost out and clean things there too, or should that be fine?  




Other things I have been thinking about but are slightly harder (especially since I only have basic tools):  

For some reason I am very tempted to take off the bottom bracket and repack the bearrings.  I am very much a novice (clearly) so is this a good idea?  I haven't had any issues like creaks or anything, I just have no idea when the last time this thing was tuned up so I don't want it to be getting all rusted or prematurely worn out or something.    

http://i.imgur.com/4SKlPHU.jpg  

Same question about the headset.  It works completely fine, but I don't want something to break if I can prevent it.

I'm a 22-year old (5'8"") who has been riding an 80s schwinn road bike for the past 4 years. I've beat the crap out of it, and now that I'm about to graduate and move across the state in September, I'm looking at selling this off and getting something new then.

Admittedly, I've taken poor care of my bicycle. I'm looking to get into the tinkering a bit more. I'm looking at buying an old road bike (bianchi, schwinn?) and over time, upgrading parts. I may eventually want to own a road bike and a fixed-gear (with flip-flop back wheel as well as brakes). I like bicycling, and 90% of the time I ride my current road bike in the same gear, so I feel like moving to a single gear would be fairly intuitive for me. 

I'm also looking at this as a good monetary investment. I'm hoping a one-time purchase of tools will save me a good amont of grief in the long run. In addition, I'd like to know the ins and outs of the mode of transportation that is hurtling me down hills and through traffic.

Got a hole near the stem and I can't patch it, so going to replace it. I noticed that 2 spokes broke when I got home, so I left it as it was. Normally I'd take it in to get it checked over and fixed, but I'm strapped for cash right now and would like to wait a little longer if possible to fix it, but at the same time I kind of need to use my bike. So if I replace the tube can the rim handle the stress of city use? Not looking for any off road use, just on roads and paths.

Pictures of the rim in question:
From the side showing the whole rim, one spoke can be seen by the rear frame of the bike, the other is the third spoke from the red reflector

[Before and after](http://imgur.com/a/nq4Yf)

Here is a list of what I have changed so far:

1. Removed and cleaned wheels with wire wool.

2.  Cleaned and oiled chain. This took two days- the chain was so grimey!

3.  Re-greased the bearings under the cones.

4. Fitted new inner tubes and tires.

5. Oiled the sturmey archer hub.

6. Cleaned and weather-proofed the bicycle.

7. Trued the spokes so that the wheels don't move so much.

There are still lots of things that need doing. The brakes and cables need replacing, as do the pedals. Eventually, a new seat would be nice. Any recommendations would be appreciated! The steering and crank both run smoothly.

I need to replace the axle(?) on the front hub. How easy is this? I'm not even sure what kind of part I need. You can see from the photo below that the thread is totally wrecked; I couldn't even get the nut back on! Any suggestions of what to do next?

1363628708.0	1ajajg	Has anyone else noticed the shitty design of egg beaters?	Swashy660	17	5	29	"A few months ago I got on an egg beater stint after I got some used ones for cheap. They were returns at my shop and I noticed they had some slight play, but I didn't really mind at the time.

About 2 months later the side to side play increased so much that I thought my cleats were loose. I had the head mechanic check it out but strangely, he couldn't get the dust caps off.

Heres an image of the exact model: http://media.performancebike.com/images/performance/products/1500/50-7925-GSL-ANGLE.jpg

The dust caps if you can't tell have a flat head socket and are made of plastic.
I bought the newer model(as far as I can tell the only difference is the spring is silver) and strangely, those dust caps were locked on too. Lightly testing a few other brand new ones revealed that the majority out of the box eggbeaters have irremovable dust caps.

I found ones that I could remove without damage, and lo and behold a week later they have absurd amounts of side to side play.

I took it apart and what I found was a very simple assembly. There is a single cartridge bearing on the end, which is held in place by an 8mm nut, which is right below the dust cap. The bearing is in turn pushed against a rubber bushing fixed in place, upon which the spindle tapers out, and the other side operates as a greased sleeve bearing. And thats it.

Apparently, this rubber bushing is either squished or compressed to the point where it gets play as the bearing now has free space upon which it can move, and the threads are limited so you cannot readjust the 8mm nut down further. I believe my old used ones lasted as long as they did because the bearing was stopped and compressed by the dust cap, thus binding the plastic.

So to me this seems kind of stupid, and although I'm kinda impressed by the simple design per crank brothers seeming design principles, I'm dissappointed that it has such a glaring flaw. Are there any experts out there that could show me something I'm missing? Is this what I get for buying $60 dollar pedals?

I searched on google for others with this issue and the consensus seems to be that they do get side play, but they(bikeforums) think it does not affect their pedaling.

EDIT: SOLVED - I had removed the derailer while cleaning the bike and reinstalled it at the wrong angle. The B-tensioner was not working, as it was mounted below the point to which it tightens. This made the jockey pulley unable to move past 6th gear. I remounted the derailer in the right position and adjusted the B-tensioner to allow the jockey pulley to clear all the cogs.

Now I'm having a bear of a time fine-tuning the shifting of the rear derailleur. It goes up in cog size like a dream, but sometimes when you hit the trigger to go down in cog size, the chain doesn't move. Hit the button another time and it skips across to the selected gear. 

I feel as though the length of the derailleur cage is affecting the shifting because it's so stubby, it doesn't take up that much slack, so I had to get liberal with the chain tightening. Please tell me how wrong I am and if there's anything I can do to get it to behave. Thanks everybody!

I found some (used) DT Swiss 340 hubs for a good price. The seller also offered an excellent price on some (new) HED Belgium C2 clinchers that he was going to use but decided not to. I foolishly assumed they were matched for each other. Amateur hour.


Turns out the hubs are 32h and rims are 24h. I really really like the the setup, so I started researching ... first reading Sheldon Brown's article on mismatched wheel building. Found some more random posts about 24h drive side, 8h on non drive side pattern, but then again that breaks the rule against relacing hubs into different patterns. 


All that being said, I'm interested to hear from some experienced wheel builders on variations of the spoke pattern. Should I pursue this, or sell the rims and get proper 32h to build. Since the C2s are a bit harder to find, I'd probably go with some Velocities.

I do a bunch of city riding on currently a carbon frame with aluminum drops and I was wondering if it would be worth upgrading to carbon drops (not for the weight difference) but for vibration dampening to reduce fatigue.   I'm a bit of a fatty and usually average 100 mi/week with usually 30 mile rides or so during the week and 50-70 mile rides during the weekend.  Usually about 40 miles in or so, I'll end up with super sore shoulders and pretty tired arms so I'm wondering if they would help at all.  I'd be picking them up from an independent builder located in NYC that uses T700 3K carbon (pressed in China, obviously) for about 120 installed?

2 questions, I guess: 1) Is it worth upgrading to carbon drops for vibration dampening 2) Is T700 3K carbon a decent material for drops?   From what I've been reading, it should be fine since a decent amount of frames are build with T700, but I'm not sure about the ""weave"" count.

1373480379.0	1i0ueu	Marzocchi Z4 Flylight super duper stiff after replacing seals &amp; oil. WTF?	sensory_overlord	12	0	7	"Fixed. See update below.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello there. So I blew a seal (heh) and thought I'd try my hand at servicing my fork myself. I already had the 3 special tools for this job (slider protector, seal press, and syringe-style air pump), so I ordered Marzocchi 7.5 wt oil and an oil &amp; dust seal kit. I downloaded instructions from enduroforkseals.com and went to work.

Everything looked good &amp; aside from one blown seal theree were no cracked or corroded o-rings, and the color of the oil was good. I cleaned everything thoroughly, lubed everything with fork oil, and followed the reassembly directions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Problem 1: far from being able to simply ""press"" in the replacement oil seal, I had to hit the top of the seal press with a hammer to get it close to where it needed to be. Even then, there was still about 3mm of space between the bottom of the oil seal and the top of the upper washer, so the upper washer was free to rattle around between the bottom of the oil seal and the top of the pilot bushing. 

* Problem 2: after filling the stanchion with the recommended amount of oil (leaving 30mm of headroom) and pressurizing to 2.5 BAR, the fork was stiff as hell. I could barely get an inch of travel out of it.

* Problem 3: figuring I has mis-measured the amount of oil I put in, I removed a further 10mm of oil, then repressurized. A tiny bit better.

* Problem 4: I now have something like 60mm of headroom and am barely getting 1.75 inches of travel when I really, really jam on it. I basically have about 3mm of preload, which has resulted in a rather weird-feeling ride. The action is smooth and the new seals are working great, but it's just crazy stiff.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So what did I do wrong? Is the problem that I left 3mm of rattling space between the oil seal and upper washer? Should I get a bigger hammer and try again? Maybe the replacement seals were a little swollen?

Your ideas are greatly appreciated.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update: I figured it out (but only after disassembly and reassembly to get that oil seal fully seated). The problem is that the manual does not specify whether the fork should be filled with oil with the fork fully extended or fully compressed. I had assumed I should fill it fully extended, but the diagram shows a sorta-kinda partially compressed fork, or maybe it's a fully compressed fork. Who knows? Those coy Italians! In rereading the directions and reexamining the diagram, I concluded that you are supposed to leave 30mm of headroom when the fork is fully compressed.

So I did just that, pressurized to 2.5 BAR, and all is well. Hoo ray.

There is no apparent contact of the chain with anything that it shouldn't touch. Changing of the gears is smooth, no problems.. just the sound. It gets louder in higher rpm, that's why I took the video at such speed. Beware, it's quite loud (captured with shitty microphone on my compact camera).

I recently decided to swap out the drive train on my homebrew Salsa Vaya. I'm going from Apex to X.0 as it suits my use better. My problem is that I cannot for the life of me get the front derailleur properly adjusted.

The reason I went with X.9 for the front is because I couldn't find an X.0 front derailleur that specifically said it was compatible with a 42/28 crankset, even though the crankset is also X.0.

I cannot get the front derailleur to reliably move the chain from the small chainring to the big chainring. The chain catchers on the big wheel will catch the chain, but have an extremely difficult time actually getting the chain onto the 42t chainring.

I have the Low limit screw bottomed out, I have the high limit screw backed almost all the way out, and my cable is tight.

my question is about the chain and the cassette (i think i already know the answer to this, but i'm an idiot, so i need someone to back me up): should i even bother cleaning it to see if any parts can be salvaged?  the chain is obviously a goner and, even to my untrained eye, the gears look they're in pretty crummy condition, too.  though, for the most part, the rest of the bike is still relatively pristine-looking, i'm pretty sure these parts have never been cleaned or maintained in any way.  they definitely have a lovely patina that can only result from: a.) being caked in layer upon layer of WD-40 for decades, or b.) being recovered from the exxon valdez oil spill.

i would wheel it down to the local bike shop and bug them with my stupid questions, but the tires are shot, the bike weighs &gt;20 lbs, and it was such an ordeal getting it into my house and up onto the bike rack to begin with that i don't want to wrestle with it again until the tire situation has been sorted out (i don't want to replace the tires until i decide whether i also want to replace the wheels, and this decision partly depends on whether a new cassette will also have to be included in my budget, and yadda yadda...), so i thought i'd give this a shot instead.  thanks in advance for any advice!"	t5_2sje0	True

MooseyDoooom	11	1	26	"I have a 14 year old Trek 800 Sport that has seen light use for many of its years, but it was unknowingly maintained pretty poorly. Still riding on all original parts, some things haven't completely worn out yet, others just haven't broken. 

Issues:
Cranks have horizontal play - pedaling I can feel both pedals and cranks shift back and forth left and right, like 1/8"" of play.

Original brakes - Still some left on the pads, does age become an issue?

Original tires - A little tread, but they are getting low

Original tubes 

Chain - has been oiled (didn't know better) maybe 2-3 times in 14 years. Seems to be ok, but no idea if it really needs to be replaced. Not really cleaned, it's full of dirt and grit.

Gears - A couple teeth have worn down, pedals fine in mid gears, going to 3 and 7 has slipped off before, generally stick to 2 and 4-6 without issues.

Rims - original, show some wear, but not sure how much is acceptable/safe. Small chance the rear wheel is slightly bent after hitting a big dip, heard a rubbing sound after hitting the dip but haven't found evidence that it was the rim.

Gear shift - Have to ride at 2 1/2 gear according to the handlebar shifter, to get it to ride in 2nd. Definitely not aligned properly, rattling occurs when pedaling, some gears worse that others.

I'm a fairly handy guy and I'm quick to learn the in's the out's of projects that I pick up. 

I want to build a cheap single speed bike that I can use for short distances (less than 5k one way). I have a budget of around $300. I know I can buy a pre-built bike for that much, but there are two caveats:

1) Living in Canada, my options are limited, unless I pay a ton in shipping. 
  2) This would be a good project for me to learn how to disassemble and reassemble a bike entirely. 

I've also been looking at used bikes in the local classifieds, and though there are many, its hard to find one thats 59 cm's. 

The bike will be used primarily for Grocery shopping, or a quick trip to a friends house. I have Kona Jake, but that being an expensive investment, I only want to use it for rides &gt; 10km's one way.     

The single speed bike will just be a bike that I don't really care about maintaining as much. i.e. I don't care about the elements, dont care about dings, dents, etc. Just a beast that I ride anywhere and that's easy to fix. 

I've been looking at cheap frames, and I saw this one on ebay: [http://www.ebay.ca/itm/Nineteen-Richter-59-cm-bike-frame-NEW-/181054263505?pt=Road_Bikes&amp;hash=item2a27acd0d1&amp;_uhb=1#ht_2102wt_1271](http://www.ebay.ca/itm/Nineteen-Richter-59-cm-bike-frame-NEW-/181054263505?pt=Road_Bikes&amp;hash=item2a27acd0d1&amp;_uhb=1#ht_2102wt_1271)


I've already sent an email to the seller asking if he knows the spacing for the front and rear hubs, that way I know what wheels to buy. 

Can anyone help me figure out the other parts that I would need?

- Fork, Bottom Bracket, crankset, chainrig. I can figure out the rest (brake, rack, handlebar etc)

These are just thoughts for now. If there's a single speed bike that I find fits my budget and is decent, most likely i'll just scoop that up instead. But if and until that happens, chances are I'll be building this one. 

Your thoughts, advice, opinions and comments are always welcome!

Thank you and have a wonderful weekend!!

I don't quite know the circumstances, but I figure it was poorly assembled and with enough stress, it popped off.

The situation:  I popped off the plastic cover from the outside of the nut.  Inside the nut was some lube and some small metal shavings.  I was able to put everything back together with a socket wrench, without difficulty, and the threading didn't look like it was stripped, but...

The question:  Are those shavings evidence of some sort of damage or is it just post-manufacturing debris?  Does it need to be cleaned out and re-lubed?  And what can I lube it with?

I have a ridiculously hard time even just getting one side of the tire off of the rim. People much stronger than me and with more bicycle expertise have had trouble too, with both my old and new tires.

Then, if I do manage to get the tire off and get the new tube put in, it is damn near impossible to get them back on without the use of the tire lever, which of course, runs the high risk of puncturing the tube. The only way I've managed it is with someone helping me by someone actively pulling the slack of the tire toward the section that I'm trying to put on.  Fortunately, I haven't been stranded more than walking distance from home with a flat yet, but if/when that happens, it's going to suck.  Honestly, it's really not safe for me not to be able to fix a flat by myself, and the problem is not lack of knowledge or inclination.

I knew it was machine built (they special ordered for it me at a really good price).  When it came in, the owner wasn't there.  I asked the tech's who installed it for me (I don't have a cassette tool) if they had run it through a truing stand.  He said 'well they're machine built' and basically shrugged it off.  Soon after I started riding I noted a pretty bad creak.  I thought it was my fenders running loose as I couldn't reproduce it on the stand.  Still nothing. Did some more research and found:

http://sheldonbrown.com/creaks.html#wheel

Which matches my symptoms exactly.  So I do a quick tension check and find ONE very loose spoke.  Like, it has probably 1/2 inch of play.  IT's on the non drive side.  I tighten it up to match the paired spoke on the non drive side and  true the wheel to better than it was from the store (it ran perfect through the stand and there wasn't any obvious loose spokes when I was done), however, on my ride this morning it still creaked quite a bit.  

I'm going to try to go back to my LBS and get them to resolve the issue.  There is another LBS that will rebuild the wheel totally for not TOO much (iirc it was around $35-40 for a total wheel rebuild), which may be an option if the place I bought the wheel from gives me some trouble about working on it.

Barking_at_the_Moon	9	0	8	"I have a stock Trek 820 with Formula hubs - specifically the FM31 rear and FM21 front. Ugh. The rear hub has started to squeak and to me that means it's time to open it up, clean it out, replace the bearings and what not.

It's a newish bike (2012, ~400 miles on it), kept clean but ridden on limestone trails a lot. I recently put ten miles on it during a ferocious rainstorm on the trails and have had lots of issues with the derailleurs, cables, etc., so I'm not surprised to see it acting up - everything else has.

A little help, if you can:

* Does anyone have a different diagnosis for the squeak? It only occurs during slow revolutions, is a little intermittent and the sound corresponds well with a noticeable drag on a free-spinning wheel. It started as a chirp, chirp, chirp just a couple of days ago and has been increasingly quickly, though at higher speeds it either goes away or is unnoticeable.
* Is it worth fixing? Let's face it, it's a cheap-ish bike and even cheaper hub. I'd replace the entire hub (it's about $17.00) but that means rebuilding the entire wheel and I really don't want to do that - too much time and, frankly, I don't have the skills or tools.
* I haven't been able to find any documentation on the web about the Formula hubs so any tricks or advice would be greatly appreciated. If anyone knows the specs and count on the bearings (1/4"" x 18 or is this a pre-assembled cartridge?) that would be a big help, likewise should I just plan on replacing the cones? For simplicity sake, I'll probably just use the Park grease but might end up with a little marine trailer wheel grease instead.

Overall, I'm very mechanically inclined though I have little experience with bikes. Conceptually, I get what needs to be done and have rebuilt axle bearing assemblies on larger wheels before. I have or will have the tools to do the job and actually think it might be interesting (weird, huh) and the worst case scenario is that I end up at the bike shop with a basket full of parts. They've seen it before, I'm sure. I'll take any advice offered, especially from anyone who has actually done something like this before.

Now it shifts gears flawlessly, however, if I put I high torque load on it, it pops and lurches forward a sixteenth of a rotation or so. I am having an extremely difficult time diagnosing the issue. The new chain is the exact same length as the old chain, the old chain had no issue with toque but had trouble shifting, specifically with the front chain rings.

I rotate the unit to center it, then I pull the lever, and the right side (facing it from the front) only pulls back a little bit and then it's way off-center (in the picture on the product page linked above, the left side is what I'm talking about).

The issue is the uppermost bit where the housing ends (sorry, total noob don't know the names of the parts). I think the housing is supposed to be attached in there somewhere but I don't know how this happens as the cap on the housing is loose in there.

EDIT: It's definitely a freewheel, it's an old dura-ace 6 speed, and the lowest gear is 21T. my derailleur says max 26 teeth, so is it even worth trying to find a 26T freewheel hub or should i just man up and do all the hills on the 21T? "	t5_2sje0	True

I'm pretty handy, but I think I'm in a little over my head here. I've looked at many pictures of axle assemblies and watched a few videos, but they're all a little different than mine.

I have all the original components of my axle assembly (I THINK), but I assembled it the way it was on the old axle, and when I put it back through the hub, the axle is sticking out too much on one side, I think. Also, looking at a ton of other axle assembly pictures online, they all seem to have an extra spacer that I don't appear to have. I really, really think I have all the pieces, but I guess it's possible I lost a spacer or something.

Here are a few pictures of my axle assembly. They're laid out in the relative positions they were on the old axle (I think). I'm basically wondering if anyone could tell me if I'm definitely missing a spacer, or there's something else I should really know:

There is very little dampening after the rebuild, and the lockout does not seem to make any difference when locked (cycling the cartridge in a bucket confirms the lockout does work). With sag set properly (80psi, 170lb rider), I can get 3/4 travel just dropping off of a curb. Adjusting the rebound does have an effect, but it's hard to tell with little compression dampening.

I'm 99% certain I got all the shims/springs etc back together in the ~~right~~ orginal order. It doesn't match any of the photos of cartridges on the fox site so I can't verify. Does anyone know where I can find an exploded diagram so I can ensure it's right?

Update:  Found this: http://www.ridefox.com/fox_tech_center/owners_manuals/05_32mm_en.pdf

Step 7-9 discusses the dampening shims, this is where oil pours out of when unlocked, possibly the previous rider was very light-weight and reduced the dampening?  Still want to ensure I have everything back together correctly. 

Update 2:  Took it by a suspension shop, to see if they had documentation.  They couldn't give it to me, but had a quick look, tech said it was all right, but the lockout appeared to be not working.  He asked what air pressure I had in it, 80psi (recommended in the manual based on 170lbs) and he recommended 120psi, I pumped it up and MUCH better, maybe a bit too stiff, I'll try 110 next ride.

Riding seemed to be about the same, with it more willing to shift if I put a lot of pressure on the pedals.  Why is the derailleur not extending all the way to the limit screw?

My first red flag was that my headset came with a star nut, but when I was taking my old headset apart I did not notice a star nut in the assembly at all. So, when all was said and done I had a star bolt leftover. Do all frames use a star bolt? Is it possible that my frame/fork doesn't utilize a star bolt or did I fuck up monumentally?

Second, when I took the frame off the repair stand, there was definitely some play to the fork. I loosened the stem and the headpiece, then retightened the headpiece and the stem in that order. I still have a bit of play though. Am I not tightening it down enough? Did I fuck up pressing my headset? Should I take it back into the shop, pop both the cups off, and re-press them?

After riding it for a bit, I figured that the easiest rear gear while being on the largest front chainring, is probably lower than I'll ever need to go.   So now I got it in my head that I want to go 1x10.  A few questions/things though:

1) Right now, when I'm in my largest chainring up front, and my smallest gear in the back... the chain rubs the front-derailleur quite a bit.  I literally just got it out of the shop for derailleur adjustments a few hours ago... is this normal for 10 speed cassettes?   This is one of the things that is kind of prompting me to ditch the front derailleur to begin with. 

2) From what I've read, a new chainring is obviously recommended, but I guess it's not technically required.  Are the benefits of a 1x10 specific chain ring definitely worth the cost? 

3) This (http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/Models.aspx?ModelID=87847) is the chainring I was considering (I was thinking about going up to a 36t... my current big ring is a 34t).  

Do I need new bolts?  Which ones (preferably from here http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/SearchResults.aspx?Search=chainring%20bolts)

What about spacers?   I can't really find any? Are these a thing?

4) I guess I should also add that my current drivetrain is all Shimano XT, since I'm assume that affects the answers. 

5) IS there a way to remove my front derailleur without breaking my chain?  (Like does it come apart in a way that allows it to not be looped around it)?

6) Chain guides? Right now I have a blackspire dually.  IT has a bashguard and a lower chain roller, but no upper.  Is this even compatible with a 1x10? (I assume it would be, just that the roller would be a tad wider than really necessary... but not that big of a deal to me).   Will chain retention be fine?  I'm not a hardcore racer so dropping a chain every now and then isn't going to kill me... I was fine with no guide on my old bike for years so, I figure this would be okay, I just wanted to make sure. 


For now, I think that's all I have to ask.  Thanks so much in advance for the help.

This occurred with a worn cleat (the original SM-SH51 pair) and is now occurring with the replacement SM-SH51 pair that I just bought. I've adjusted the tension nuts on the pedal, and no matter how tight I get the springs, the issue remains (while making it dangerously difficult to clip out). I've also tightened the Phillips screws on the pedal body.

1364933759.0	1bjdms	I'd like to thank everyone here at /r/bikewrench for helping me with my bike last week (the mysterious clicking problem)	fozziefreakingbear	13	2	9	"Thought I'd give you guys a followup. 

So after taking it to my university's bike repair place (they couldn't identify it before so I thought I'd find the source here and take it to them to fix since they had the tools).

Anyways, I took my bike to the bike repair place and they rebuilt my bottom bracket. I took it for a spin, but the problem actually got worse and the wobble in cranks got worse as well. I took it back and they tried tightening it again but to no avail. After they rode it around (they couldn't before because it's usually a busy shop but they were perplexed at this point) they decided to look at the crankset. Sure enough, a bunch of teeth were worn off on the third and second gear (the ones I use the most) and I had only had this bike for less than a year so that was really weird. 

After they replaced the crankset the problem still persisted so they rebuilt my bottom bracket again since the wobble was still there. Upon doing that, they noticed that one of the cups had like an indentation thing on it so it wasn't tightening properly and was the main cause for my problem.

All in all, I'd like to thank you guys for your help, it was a little bit of what you all said, and I'd like to thank you guys for teaching me a bit more about bikes and being patient with me if I didn't understand your vernacular.

Can I buy 700C wheels set up for a 5-speed freewheel with the right spacing or would I have to build such a thing?  I don't want this to cascade into upgrading brakes and derailers and respacing the frame and new levers and shifters and everything.

Didn't come with fenders, and I live in Philly now, so in prep for winter I ordered some. Decided I'd install them myself, how hard could it possibly be?

Well, I didn't realize that you could loosen the brakes from *behind* the tube via that hex nut (it looked like it was welded into the tube, I had no idea...), so I proceeded to disassemble the brake calipers and unscrew the whole assembly from the front. It seemed like it was awfully tight, but I didn't know any better. It turned out that there was a tiny alan screw on the underside, locking the bolt in place, and my powerful unscrewing had rethreaded the center bolt through the whole brake assembly. Oof. Now when I try to tighten it back together, it threads askew. Ruined.

I swung by my local bike shop hoping they'd have a spare bolt by chance. No dice. All they had was a bad attitude about my fuck up. I guess I deserve it, but it certainly didn't help shit.

So here's the question! Is there *anywhere* I can find a replacement bolt for the front R365 by Tektro? If so, is it worth trying to reassemble the whole thing, knowing I'm as noob as I am? *If not*, should I consider any other brake systems if I'm gonna end up replacing it outright anyway?

I figured it was better to post this here than to muck up r/bicycling. I'm having issues with my tires. Nothing insane, mind you, but I have started to dread riding for fear of another flat. I will try to provide as much information as possible and the ideas I have been mulling over.

My bike is a 48cm Specialized Dolce Sport from last year. I bought the bike secondhand in June of this year, nearly everything is stock at this point. So...the rims, rim tape, front tire tube, both tires are all stock. Rear tube is of course not stock as it keeps getting flats. 

I live in NYC and as such there's always glass everywhere or sharp little gravel rocks from the DOT resurfacing roads. The type of riding that I do is commuting throughout the week and then on the weekends I enter ""tours"" or go on 30+ rides with my friends. Sometimes I travel during the weekend to visit family and go on long rides. I would consider myself someone who prefers riding longer distances than just for commuting. I always try to ride on nicely paved roads but sometimes gravel/chips are unavoidable. I push myself when I ride but don't usually try to race unless I have entered a ride that I paid for. I try my best to avoid hazards but it doesn't always work.

My LBS told me to inflate my tires to 115 psi for the type of rides I go on, and my size. I'm female, about 140-145 pounds and fit. My tires are 700c x 23 mm and my rims say: ""Mavic CXP-22, S6000 622x15.""

The flats I get are from debris punctures. My most recent flat was causes by what looked like, I kid you not, a cat nail. I am constantly wiping and picking stuff off the wheels, but they are just so buttery and pick up tons of stuff.

I want to do longer and longer rides. I want to be able to do a ride bike/ camp along the way combo trip without having to take like 6 spare tubes with me. I did a century ride this past weekend and my flat tire really screwed me up.

A friend of mine works for REI and has installed Latex stand ins on his mountain bike and he raves about them. I've seen mixed reviews about them on Reddit. Probably the best advice I've seen on Reddit was to just eat the cost of new rims and tires for the tubeless road bike tires. I don't know how much that'll run me though.

So I've been researching Conti Gaterskins and Conti Gator hardshells and the Conti GP4000S. There are so many tires though, and I don't want to accidentally get one I can't corner with or is super heavy. It's already a little dicey carrying a fully loaded bike down the stairs of my apartment.

One thing for sure I know to steer clear of from what I've seen are the Slimer tubes.

I guess at this point I'm trying to decide whether to A.) just replace tires, use standard tubes, B.) replace tires and go with the caffelatex, or C.) go tubeless.

I have another big ride in two weeks, at least one more century ride this fall and I'm just sick of blowing tubes at inopportune moments.

Thank you for any help you can provide.

EDIT: I talked to my LBS owner today (not the guy who told me patches are worthless, don't worry) and we talked tires. He also said the gatorskins or armadillos would be great. He recommended actually getting a road touring tire for when I ride outside the city and swapping out for a tough puncture resistant tire for riding around the city. I don't really like the idea of switching tires back and forth, so I'm leaning more toward the Conti Gatorskins at this point. He also said to just replace the back tire since the front hasn't ever given me a problem. I was wrong on my size, I have 700-25c on my bike currently. Bike dude also said for me to come in once a week for him to show me his way of very quickly changing a flat, so I have flat class with my bike mechanic it would seem.

Oh and, so this past Sunday I got a flat during the NYC Century. I have not ridden since then, but I did today. I got a flat at the meetup site for my Thursday night social ride. Needless to say I was pissed. I think I'm going to buy the new tire(s) TOMORROW, Amazon be damned, from my local guy. I have to do a 60-80 mile training ride Saturday and can't afford getting like 3 flats considering they seem to be increasing at an exponential rate."	t5_2sje0	True

I understand that the derailleur controls the tension on the chain, but, if my derailleur has been properly adjusted by my LBS and is working properly, is there anything else I can do? I have heard that removing a link is a no-no.
Oh, and I also have a chainstay protector on (made it from an old tube, thanks Reddit!) and it reduced the noise a lot but it's still the loudest bike on the trail.

On my past few rides, however, my seat has started twisting side to side. I assumed my seat post clamp was loose, and so it would be as easy as tightening it.

I have an MTB that I ride offroad on the rare occasion right now as I try and get into shape on the road more often. I probably should have gotten a road bike initially, but that chance is long gone (as is my $1000).

I have two questions:

1) Should I just ride my knobby tires and not worry, since I'll be getting a workout either way.

2) If no to 1, then would it hurt the rims at all in the long run to be changing out my road tires for my offroad tires every few weeks?

Anyways, just wanted to get some feedback, thanks. I don't have the money to buy even a cheap roadie or get a second set of rims for the MTB but if I could I would. I just want to lose some weight and not die of a heart attack or stroke at 40, so I figured I'd do it via bike!"	t5_2sje0	True

I recently moved into a new apartment in San Francisco. While cleaning out under a staircase, I found an old bicycle that is in need of some work. Apparently it's a 1976 Raleigh Sprite 27. I live with my girlfriend and neither of us have bikes, so it would be awesome if I could get it riding again. 

Would it be worth fixing up? The metal components (handlebars, wheels, etc.) all have spots of rust but the frame looks to be in good shape. The tires are shot but the gears work and it rolls okay. To be honest, I'm not even sure how you're supposed to shift it, but everything on the handlebars is seized. I'm mechanically inclined and have plenty of time, but I know precious little about bikes / bike repairs.

They are original to the bike actually, and I'd like to keep them on there but I generally can't lock up either wheel under any conditions. 

I used to have some xtr brake shoes that took M65 cartridges but I stopped using them awhile back because replacement cartridges are hard to find. Currently I have some standard road cartridges on there (velo-orange). I can't say I see a huge difference between the two and from what layman knowledge I know of friction coefficients changes the size of the pad shouldn't change the stopping power, only the wear rate on the pad.

I have the rebound springs on the front brake on their highest tension, otherwise the straddle cable hanger is too loose and rattles against my headset. The rear is on the middle setting but I want to bump that one up too, the brake rebound just fine but there is a little slack in the cable when at rest that I'd like to take up. Even still though, I keep them closely adjusted, there is not much more than a mm of clearance between pad and rim at rest with the cable taut.

So what can I do? Is there some way of adjusting the straddle cable that will help? Will changing the rubber compound of the pads help any? Or do I need to just switch to a better brakeset with better leverage and stopping power?

Last time out, about halfway through my run, the chain came off the crank and got stuck between the frame and the crank (no biggie, this has happened a couple of times before) I flipped the bike over, guided the chain back into the crank, and all was well.

A few minutes later, however, I noticed the chain would slip every five cranks or so.  I stopped again to examine the chain for obvious imperfections, the derailleurs and crank teeth for signs of wear, but nothing.  I was able to rule out the crank since this seemed to happen in every gear.  My gut says it's either a problem with the chain or one of the derailleurs, but I wasn't able to spot anything with obvious. The chain looks to be in good shape, and the rear derailleur's tension and jockey pulleys appear to be in line. Googling the issue in every combination of words I could think of yielded only suggestions that it might be wear (this bike has probably been ridden ~20 times) and links to sheldon brown's site.

Before I take it to the LBS tomorrow I plan to take another look at it tonight.  Basically what I'm asking here is, does this kind of thing sound familiar to anyone, or are there some other troubleshooting steps I could take before handing it off to the experts?  I'd like to get better at maintenance so when things happen like this on the trail I can diagnose and fix on the spot, or at least keep myself from making things worse.

I [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/comments/1jp3h1/need_help_fix_my_old_bike_or_buy_a_new_one_if_new/) over in /r/MTB about my recent problem and whether to fix or not.  Seems like fix is the common response so I come here for help.  

I was riding and noticed that under high force the rear tire rubbing against the frame.  Limped the bike home and saw the there was a fair amount of play in the rear wheel.  

Upon taking it apart I first noticed that the rear axle? (what connects frame to rear assembly) was bent a bit.  When spinning the rear gears there is a certain spot where there is noticeably more resistance.  Also looking at the bolt that runs through the hub assembly there is a noticeable amount of play as well as some wobble from something bent in there.

I wanted to further take it apart but it appears that a special tool or more knowledge than I posses is needed.  

I was wondering if anybody could help out with identifying the problem and a potential cost for parts and if it is something better off for a pro to fix, labor as well.

I am a complete newbie and really am looking to start riding more, and start using my bike for commuting again.  I currently have a '86 Cavaletto Centurion men bike that fits me perfectly (female 5'3""). I have very little information on it other then what I can find through Sheldon Brown's catalog post. If needed I can post pictures later, I am at work right now and can't. It is in pretty great condition for being that old with all the original parts when I got it for $12 at Goodwill. I put about $100 into it to fix a bent rim and general maintenance when I acquired it 5 years ago, and got at LEAST 1000 miles out of it over the course of several months. Sadly it has fallen into disrepair after moving to a few different states and being on the bus line that takes me directly to work.








The current issues I have with it are, the stem shifters will not stay in place (tend to drift down no matter what I do), something is rubbing causing a squeak and resistances (have not been able to find the source thus far, sounds like it would be a rubber on rubber sound and it is not the brake pads or the tires rubbing), the chain nearly derails when shifting and will not stop making noise against the front derailleur (I am guessing this is due to the shifter issue), the front wheel appears to still be or has rebent or untrued itself, and the brakes leavers (can't find a name for the kind I am talking about, but they aren't generally in use in modern bikes anymore, and are nearest the stem on standard drop handle bars) are really loose/warped and nearly come out of the hand brake on the curved portion of the handlebars. The wheels need new tubes and tires, but that is normal for it sitting for as long as it has and I don't consider a real issue.








My question is should I a) drop another $100 and get it refurbished professionally (Bike Farm in ATX), b) look into fixing it myself (know I have ZERO idea what I am doing so that could get interesting), or c) buy a ""new"" road bike with longevity in mind?









I am asking y'all because you would probably have the best idea of cost to future performance of my current bike vs cost to future performance of x bike. I really can not say how much I appreciate ANY help you can give!

My problem is that when using the trim in the small chain ring, it hardly has any effect.

Secondly, when I shift to the large chain ring, it shifts into the trim mode. Now maybe that's what it's supposed to do but when I try to shift up out of the trim, it is quite stiff and I get no feedback (any click) when I get out of the trim and into the normal setting. Now, I would be alright when tinkering with it but, from reading the 105 instructions, I should have a barrel adjuster (they call it a Outer casing adjustment bolt).

I'd rather spin it out in the big ring, and be able to shift up quick as I go down hill, without even touching the small chain ring.

I have a 2007 Gary Fisher Mako with stock rims and 26x2.0 tires and 6100 miles.  Recently, if I pump the tires up to the max pressure (65, identical to the original tires), my brakes lock up.  It appears that my rims are expanding outwards or something.  Is there anything I can do about this, or do I need new wheels?  Are mine unsafe?  How can I avoid this in the future?  I reduced tire pressure to compensate, but I'm wondering if being exposed to extreme temperatures and weather has fatigued the rims.  

Thanks for any help.  :)

EDIT: While I was at work yesterday (a bike shop, actually) we put the rear wheel on the truing stand.  It's definitely failing.  The inner part of the braking surface (i.e. towards the hub) was true, and the outer edge (towards the tire) was bowing out in various places.  The braking surface itself is concave.  I never use the rear brake (except in icy conditions), so it is most likely from a combination of temperature fluctuations, inflation pressure/tire shape (26x2.0 is rather puffy), and having to ride a few miles on a flat a few years ago when I got stuck in the ghetto.  

I ended up ordering a new rear wheel.  The front wheel is beginning to suffer a similar problem, likely due to insane brake wear, but I'm going to wait a bit before replacing it.

I bought a single-speed bike second hand a couple of weeks ago, and seem to be having unending problems with it!

I initially had a problem with the left (non-chain) crank side working loose while riding, no matter how much I tighten the crank bolt before riding - I even purchased a set of allen key crank bolts to help me get it as tight as possible! After doing a bit of research, I came to the conclusion that the square taper on the crank must have worn out somehow, so I bought a [new set of cranks on eBay](http://r.ebay.com/y15vSK). Admittedly, these cranks were crazy cheap, and when they arrived, I inspected the square-taper fitting and observed that it looked pretty shoddy - not the ""perfect square"" I would have liked to have seen.

Anyway, I fitted them to the bike, all was well for a few days, and then exactly the same problem again - left-side crank coming loose mid-ride. I've been re-tightening when convenient, but given that the cranks were cheap and bad, and I wanted a different-sized chainring on the front anyway, I've shelled out a bit extra for some [decent branded cranks](http://r.ebay.com/npRCLR). 

But my question is this: if I fit these new cranks to my bike, how can I make sure this doesn't happen again? I'd hate to chew up the taper of another set of cranks if it comes loose again. I've seen some people suggest blue loctite, but then others state that this is only an interim solution at best. When I initially bought the bike I removed, cleaned, and re-greased the bottom bracket - and it didn't look (to my untrained eye) particularly worn out. Could this be the problem though?

Which doesn't work for me as a long time motorcycle rider because I am used to my right hand controlling the front brake. Had to do an emergency stop yesterday and almost looped the loop because the rear wheel came up and I instinctively loosened up on the right hand which of course did precisely nothing. Came to a stop with something like an inch to spare...

On cable-brake bikes, switching the levers over the right way is easy. On this bike with hydraulic brakes, the easiest way would be to switch the full brake lever but then they'd be upside down (i.e. the side that points up now would point down after the switch), which makes me nervous given they're hydraulic. 

Is there a way to take apart the lever and switch the lines ? Or in general, a recommended way to get them to switch sides, without opening the hydraulic loop ? Thanks for any pointers.

EDIT: thanks for the discussion. I went and switched side with the whole brake assembly, then realized the levers are positively meant to stay on the side they're meant for, switched the levers and now the logo on the brakes points down (there is not switchable cover that I can see) and screws point up, but it works fine. So far. And now I like those brakes a lot more, I am amazed at the difference that braking the front with the right hand makes."	t5_2sje0	True

I just bought a new bike for touring, and I want to fit a front dynamo hub. I have a specific hub in mind and just want to know what my options are and a quick google hasn't turned up anything useful.

The way I see it (with no knowledge at all of the situation) there are potentially 4 options:

- Buy the hub, take the existing hub out, put the new one in... Simple...and highly unlikely.

- Buy the hub that I want, realise that it's a different size to the current hub, buy shorter spokes, fit the hub and new spokes.

- Buy the hub and a completely new wheel, fit the hub in the new wheel

- Buy a new wheel with the hub already fitted

Just to add, I have never built a wheel and would not carry out this work myself, I just want to know the facts and likely expense before I visit my LBS.

For the record, the wheel is a 700c Alex Adventurer and the hub that I think I want is the Schmidt SON 28 Classic Dynamo Front Hub, but any advice on that is also appreciated.

It has rather suddenly developed a squeaking noise. Yesterday it was ridden in wet (not rainy) conditions (albeit with fenders) and was gently hosed down and washed quickly with a sponge because I take care of her. The noise occurs ONLY while pedaling and ONLY while pedaling forward. I think it's from the rear and not the BB but I can't tell so well; I'm not good at noises. If the wheel spins, no noise. If I pedal backwards, no noise. Here is where it gets stranger: it seems to only happen / be more pronounced in the larger cogs (easier gears). If I'm in the 12, 13, or 14 it doesn't seem to do it at all whereas if I'm in the 23 it squeaks badly. This is irrespective of the chainring I am riding in.

Does anyone know what would cause this? What steps should I take to identify it?


EDIT: I also should mention that I've lubed the chain twice in the past 5 days, including 1.5 hours before today's ride, because of the conditions and because I have been doing 150-200 miles a week on it and riding my road bike on the dry days.

Particularly my rear brakes. The sound is very coarse, and quite low in pitch. It's not a squeak. It reminds me of white noise. I've looked up some videos on brake pad adjustment, and I've tried fiddling a bit to move the pads around but it hasn't helped. The pads look quite flush to the rim, and as far as I can tell it's not hitting the thread (I thought this would be the cause).

My guess is the inner-tire(inner tube?) pushed the tire off the rim, as it happened before after I inflated it.
In the pictures I already deflated the tire somewhat to prevent it from getting worse.

Last time I went to the shop where they pushed it back on the rim, I can't seem do it myself. But since it happens more often, I'm looking for a more permanent fix. 

My initial thought was getting an entire new wheel because the current one is a bit rusty, but otherwise good. Those are a little expensive, since you can almost buy an equal (second hand) bike for that price. 
It's just my everyday bike. I ride it to class and go to the supermarket on it, now I have to walk and/or take public transport which takes me a hell of a lot time longer(turns 10 minutes ride to class into 40 minutes).

1356085669.0	157zo4	Advice regarding recent LBS Service	Shpox	11	4	32	"Hi Wrenchers, I'm after a bit of advice regarding a recent service with my LBS. I had to pop in for a service regarding a creaky bottom bracket recently and wrote up a list of instructional notes for the drop off that were listed under their service details. Dropped it off and got a text to come pick her in the afternoon up but unfortunately the sales persons generally approach you to to return the bike as the mechanics go home when they're done so I had no one to talk to regarding technical stuff.

Anyway, I noticed the creak was still there as I took it for a ride before dropping it in my car and went back and asked if I could show them using the wind trainer. The guys mentioned they can't fix it (as they're sales) so one of the guys took it for a ride acknowledged there was a noise in the high gear and mentioned it was just lateral stress on the crank and just to keep a high cadence and it should be fine.

When I got home I had a chance to properly look at things and noticed that the sound was actually the chain rubbing against cage in both the high and low ring. If I manually move the chain over, the noise stops. On top of this, the shifts between the high and low on the front derailleur weren't crisp so I had to use the barrel adjusters to fix this, making the tension in the shift gear lever almost uncomfortably tensioned. The rear derailleur was also shifting poorly (hanging in certain gears) though this is something I can fix myself by just using the barrel adjuster. 

Finally, I noticed that the seat post clamp actually didn't belong to my bike. It's silver and black where my colour scheme on my bike is completely black as a part of its FSA finishing kit.

On my instruction sheet, I had also asked them to let me know of any chain wear but they didn't let me know.

I don't want to cause any conflict but I feel a bit let down as I was looking to riding on the weekend and don't want to end up with a beat up cage or making things worse. Am I being too unreasonable to expect these things? I feel like my bike should come back in a better condition than when it went in.

1348233257.0	108vl4	Five flats in three weeks - can't find anything wrong with rim or tire....  Thoughts? Suggestions?	DippDippDipp	10	1	22	"I run a KHS Urban Soul with stock 700x26 tires, use 700-19x25 tubes, inflated to about 110psi front, 100psi back.  I'm 190lbs.

I ran a few flats two weeks ago on my back wheel.  Three years with this setup, never too many issues flat wise so I didn't think much of it.  Did a quick scan of the rim and tire, didn't really find much at fault.  Chalked it up to bad luck, new tubes, and kept going.

Ran another flat last week, found some potential issues on the rim, maybe?  The stock rims come with that weird plasticky rim tape?  Seems to cover all the spoke holes fine, in some places its a little off centre.  It's not really a tape so I can't really push it back to the exact of the inside of the rim but I put some rubber tape on places where it might be an issue, seemed to take care of the hard edges.

The tires I really really checked, I've put a lot of mileage on them, they're wearing out, but nothing sharp and no rips aside from a little tiny one that I patched up.  Another new tube and kept going.

Another flat yesterday.  So I checked all my tubes that have gone flat lately recently. All the holes seem to be on the tire side (outside) but in different spot relative to the valve. So I'm thinking tire issue right?  Figure I'd put in a new tube and buy a new tire today during lunch - crossing fingers that I don't run another flat in that small window.

(EDIT: Should note that all the flats to this point have been one tiny hole - indicating puncture flats, not pinches.  And also, I've used three different brands of tubes.)

So I wake up this morning and it's completely flat... UNUSED SINCE THE NEW TUBE I PUT IN LAST NIGHT!  Not even out the house yet.

I'm currently using the stock tires that came with it, 700x32 Bontragers. They're getting a little funky looking down by the rims, and I want to install the Schwalbe Marathon Plus I bought a year ago. Bike is now mostly a commuter. 

When I tried to put the new tires on originally, I thought they were too wide, and wouldn't seat on the rim, so I hung them up and figured I'd use them on some other bike down the road. However, I have recently read that Marathon's are notoriously difficult to install the first time, so I'm thinking of giving it another try. 

The new tires are labeled: 28-622, 28x1 1/8, 700x28C. 

The old tires are marked 32-622, 700x32C. 

Should these new tires fit on these rims? I have had a set of 25C Gatorskins on these same rims in the past, if that's relevant. 

EDIT: Success! I've only got one on because I didn't have a 2nd tube. A tube you say?? Well, turns out the 700x28 tubes I bought with the tires were just too big, and there was no way all that tube was going to fit inside. So, I grabbed a new 700x20/28 tube that I had (much narrower!), installed that, and with the guidance of /r/bikewrench and [this video](http://youtu.be/-XUFVrl0UT4), was able to get the front tire installed and pumped up to 100psi.

I figured it would be a nice side project for me to fix it up. Now, not being a bike person, I had no clue what I was getting myself into.

I'm looking to outfit the bike with new(ish) parts in order to use it for getting between classes. As such, I'm not looking for top-of-the-line parts, but am looking for something that I know is quality. To begin, I outlined the things I wanted to replace:

1. Tires. The rear rim is bent, so I'll need a new one anyway.
2. Chain and chain system. The chain system is rusty, so I want to get it a new one that's nice and clean.
3. Brakes. I can already see myself barreling down the sidewalk towards an intersection and have my brakes fail. Possibly can get by with just tuning, but may need to buy new ones.
4. Handlebars. This is more of a cosmetic change, but the current configuration of the handlebars is whacked up, and the metal is completely rusted.

After getting the functionality to where I want it, I'd like to repaint the frame to get rid of the Roadmaster decal and horrid paint job!

Now, I could probably pay a bikeshop to take care of this for me, but I want to take pride in my clunker, and use it as a way to give me something to do. So, suggestions as to what parts to buy, where to purchase, and general tips on restoring a bike would be appreciated!"	t5_2sje0	True

I include frames like the c'muter and the pacer because I'm having a difficult time choosing between the tradeoff: it seems like long chainstay bikes don't handle as responsibly. Is that right? Reviews seem to put the snappiness of surly frames as Pacer&gt;CC&gt;LHT. 

Are there any other frames (&lt;$500-ish) that I should be considering?

Now onto drivetrain - looking to do 2x10 for simplicity, ease of setup, elegance. I'm coming from a 12-speed 60s schwinn so I'm used to the double crankset, and I feel that at triple you're introducing more redundancy than actual versatility compared to certain 2x10 setups (or maybe that's just SRAM's propaganda getting to me?). Anyway, I'm looking to cobble together a budget version of SRAM's Apex group in terms of gear ratios. compact crank, and about a 11-32 cassette. 

The problem is that I'm starting the build with bar-ends for budgetary reasons. hoping to eventually get the funds to upgrade to brifters after owning the bike for a while. Not very picky between STI and DoubleTap but I'm worried about compatibility issues. Here's what I'm seeing for options:

* cranks: Tiagra/Apex, any issues doing tiagra crank+apex cassette?
* Front Derailleur - would anyting work? Should I just choose something cheap (sora/acera)?
* Either Apex or Deore cassette/RD.

My understanding is that the RD is what truly matters for brifters, and the FD shouldn't really care. In this case, is sticking with SRAM back there the way to go? I think I read somewhere that 10-speed deore has issues with shimano  STI's? I could use a 9-speed mountain RD for the STI's, but then I'd be losing gear and at that point it may be more practical to go 3x9, something i would rather not do. "	t5_2sje0	True

So the latest adventure of my [second-hand bike](http://www.reddit.com/r/bikewrench/comments/1ifnck/advice_dealing_with_centrepull_breaks/) is under way, the problem this time is just identifying exactly what a particular bit of my bike is actually called. 

To fit a new light I bought, I had to remove the front brakes (well, technically it was removing the housing for the old, broken, light which required me to remove the front brakes). Unfortunately once I did that, the end-cap at the bottom of the centre of my fork fell out. and it turns out that (even though the rest of the fork is just fine), this cap is is seriously bad condition - it's rather misshapen, and now i can't get it in position to screw the brake-mounting bolt back through it properly. I may give it another shot, but I doubt I'll have much luck.

Unfortunately I didn't think to get a pic while working on it earlier. But to make it clear what type of thing we're dealing with, [here](http://i.imgur.com/7FhA46yh.jpg) is an image of the front brake. Just behind those two crossed arms is a bolt which runs through the tube, and also acted as support for this end cap.

What the hell is this thing called? It's some kind of cap, located on the bottom of the fork (directly between the two legs of the fork, right above the front wheel). It appears to have been held in position exclusively by the bolt that holds the front brakes in their place - is it even important anyway? And is it something that I can easily find a replacement for? For what it's worth, the bike's a Peugeot, but new enough that everything is standard sizes (none of the weirdness involved with older French bikes).

Any answer would be great, but there are bonus points* if you can tell me what the German term for this is. I'd rather not make the local bike guys suffer through the above description in my very broken German…

1374599655.0	1iw8gl	New rear cassette for hills = shifting quark	Brutalos	8	1	15	"I have a new Raleigh Roper. Shimano 105 drivetrain (34/50, 11-28). I live around some brutal hills and the 34:28 was not low enough. After much debate and thinking about it I had my LSB install a XT long cage derailleur and a 11-36 SRAM cassette. Essentially gaining two lower gears. (I would have looked at triple cranks but I didn't like the way they felt)

So my LBS tells me ""Everything turned out great. On occasion when you are in the 36t and you hit shift up it doesn't shift out right away.""

I thought it was going to be ok. Now that I've ridden it a few times it's sort of an annoyance. Especially when you are feeling the suck after going up a steep incline. 

I went back to the shop. I was told that if I wanted the 11-36 it's what I'd have to live with. 

What do you think? I have to assume it's setup right. I know they tried a few combinations of parts and this is what worked best. 

I'm on the verge of putting the stock parts back on and selling the bike so I can get something with a triple. I don't want to do that. At all. I like this bike but this quark is driving me nuts. "	t5_2sje0	True

Trying to compose a wheelset for my new bike. It's a fixed gear cyclocross which limits me to 130mm rear hubs.

Goal is to have reasonable lightweight and good quality/durable wheels. They wont be seeing too much abuse. 

The build is:  

**Velocity A23 rims**  
**Sapim CX-Ray spokes**  
**DT Swiss Alloy Nipples**  Edit: Brass from now on.  
**Paul FHUB Front Hub**  
**Paul High Flange Rear Hub**  

This comes out at approx. $650 including labor. Does this seem like a decent builld, any obvious things I should change or are there anything else worth pointing out?

How much of an issue is chain line in regards to adjusting it, say you need a couple of millimeters in either direction.. Is it possible to use spacers or something similar around the rear cog? It should match up pretty well with this setup according to some quick research, but as a general questions it would be good to know.

Nearest lbs is two hours away but if things get too complicated I might just make the trip instead.

1374161882.0	1ikbrr	Acceptable QR tightness for the stem of a Dahon Folder	cptfx	9	0	7	"I just purchase a Dahon P8 off of craigslist and the stem is bistable (I've noticed some other cosmetic damage after purchasing and it looks like it may have been in a crash of some kind). There is a bump in the steering tube and a groove on the stem that is supposed to define the centered position. The default position of the handlebars is tilted with respect to the wheel.  There is some play in the bump/groove and I can get it to be well aligned at the extreme of the play. This is good enough for me.

The problem comes in when I'm riding, specifically when I'm starting and putting a lot of pressure on the frame. I've found that the handlebars will rotate to the default misaligned position and the shift can be quite jarring and dangerous. I have the QR pretty tightly clamped, more so than I would for a seat post, and this has reduced the problem but it still can happen. I want to tighten it down more but I don't know how tight is too tight. 

Any advice? Should I be able to see the notch in the steering tube compress when I tighten the QR? Should this problem be addressed in some other way? What sort of pictures or video would help to illustrate the point or help to diagnose.

tldr: I want to really crank down a quick release that's holding a post in a tube. How tight can can I go?

* Titanium triathlon frame
* Sturmey Archer 3-speed with drum brake
* S-A Drum brake in the front
* Double front chainring
* Pursuit bars with TT brake levers
* Thumb shifters inside brake levers (https://www.dropbox.com/s/viz4k6oinajluif/IMG_20130618_224919.jpg)

And here's the problem I've run accross:  What's the best way to get the rear shift cable from the BB guide to the guide arm?  The guide arm for the hub sticks farther forward than the housing stop on the chainstay, so I can't run it normally.  I initially tried using a short section of housing from the BB to the arm, but that either interfered with the crankarm or introduced too much friction for the hub to pull the cable back in.  After a bit of tooling around, I ended up with this godawful setup:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/ihjxn7yxjhjxakj/IMG_20130701_203718.jpg

This has two benefits--first, it seems to be fully functional.  Second, it looks absolutely ridiculous, which is a bit of a goal for this bike.  It just seems a bit hammer-fisted to me, and I'd like to know if anyone has any other ideas on how I could cleanly and effectively route that shift cable.

Thanks in advance!

How to get better gearing options than S-A's wide range 3-speed?  Added front derailleur and double chainring with 46/38 gears to split it up nicely.  How to fit 117mm wide S-A hub into 130mm road frame?  Got my hands on internals from a different hub, used it's longer axle to span the dropouts, and spaced it out properly with a few nuts and washers.  How to attach the front brake's reaction arm to the deep-section TT fork?  Not completely sure here, but I'm thinking it'll involve running the wheel backwards so that the reaction arm pulls forward, then bolting that to some sort of metal strap around the fork.)"	t5_2sje0	True

So I'm riding a 1987 schwinn World Sport(Tour?). Anyways awhile ago I needed to change out my crankset and seeing as it would be all new teeth, I replaced the chain. I found out that the axle(bottom braket?) that was originally there, and that I was keeping, is really wide. So wide that the new crankset isn't close enough for the front derailer to be of use any more(I'm not too concerned as I RARELY use that other gear anyways). But then this new problem has come up. 

If I have the chain on the smallest ring in the back, it jumps. to be honest, I'm not really sure whats going on because if I put my bike on a stand, it doesn't do it. So this is only happening when there's real wieght behind the push. It could be jumping or something else. I just know that while riding it's a little crazy having something happen like two or three times in a full pedal rotation.

I went to the obvious answer that I need to adjust the limit screws and it'll be all set.

Nothing. Fucked with both the screws(incase I was adjusting the wrong one) and it didn't help.

If I put the chain on the ring next to it, no problems. In fact that's how I've been getting to class and work is running on this slightly bigger ring. This is alright, but sucks not getting the speed I'm used to, or having all my energy used. 

I had a rack on and thought that the screw might be the cause. But I took that off last week and still have the problem.

I'm planning to replace the chain but another problem is that the bike doesn't shift gears properly. It can shift to higher gears, but won't stay on them at all. 

Now don't worry, I wont ask you how to fix it, the internet has some amazing tutorials for troubleshooting. The thing I am worried about is, from my previous experience with bikes, that fixing gear problems on a bike can be very tedious and takes experience. I am relatively new to biking. I'd like to fix it myself to gain some more knowledge/ fixing skills but I don't want to risk fucking up something as important as the gears. 

Should I try fixing it myself or should I let the pros do it?

Edit: Ok, so I made up my mind to follow the suggestions you guy's made, especially tweaking the shifter screws and checking if the derailleur cage is straight and if that all fails then I'll go to my lbs. Some extra details I should've mentioned: The bike is one of those vintage schwinns and uses friction shifters.

The seller threw in a Sunrace BBS15 bottom bracket with a spindle length of 118 mm.

I hope so, because the shortest BBS15 is 107 mm. I could also get a BLB x Tange BB with a 103 mm spindle, which their site says is designated for Sugino cranks. Would this solve my problem, or is this crank simply not compatible with my wheel / frame? I also found the Miche Primato BB which doesn't have a flange so that should allow for even more chainline adjustment?

1368453786.0	1e8sxm	Handlebars coming out of alignment with fork; NVO adjustable stem	SublethalDose	8	0	6	"There's no ""play"" or ""jiggle"" but I'm concerned that the connection is not tight enough.  I'll try to give complete information and background below, but basically I have three questions:  how much force should be required to move the handlebars if the front wheel is held in place, how do I adjust this force with an NVO stem and shim, and is this a normal problem or should I be worried that something is damaged?

For background, I rode over a couple hundred yards of rough road where I was forced to the far right, getting sucked into the seam between the gutter and the crumbling road, and I was using a little bit of force to keep the bike tracking and not let it get stuck in that seam and other lengthwise cracks in the road.  While I was doing this, my handlebars came thirty or forty degrees out of alignment with my front wheel.  Halfway through this length of road I stopped, braced the wheel against my leg, and realigned the handlebars.  After emerging from the rough patch I stopped and adjusted again, but the second adjustment was minor.  However, while riding home on relatively smooth pavement, the handlebars started to come out of alignment again, this time without any unusual force applied.

The handlebars have only come out of alignment twice before, when I first bought my bike and was learning what toe overlap was. 

My bike has an [NVO adjustable threadless stem](http://www.nvocomponents.com/), so the stem attaches to a shim that goes over the steerer tube.  The stem is not rotating around this shim -- there's a ridge on the shim that prevents it -- so I assume the steerer tube is rotating inside the shim.  I'm a bit uncertain because on a normal threadless stem, the stem would be rotating around the steerer tube, and I'd tighten the stem bolts (right?)  By process of elimination, I've decided the stem bolts serve the same function in my setup, but I don't know what level of tightness to shoot for.

Any guidance will be much appreciated!  Thank you!

EDIT:  There is a single stem bolt, and I just noticed it has a torque rating (7-8 N m) printed on the side.  I don't have a way to check the torque, though, and I'd rather know how to do it by feel anyway.

I bought this bike a couple of years ago for 100Euros, and since then I have easily ""invested"" at least another 100 for repairs. I can't afford to put any more money towards a bike at the moment, and besides that I really like this one and I'd like to use it.

So the rear wheel is crooked, the hub (Is that what that part is called in english?) is broken and the spokes are all kind of messed up...

I was quoted a 60euro repair bill in a bikeshop.  They straighten the wheel , but if I understood correctly that price wouldn't involve a new hub (Their English was pretty bad so I couldn't completely understand)

Any idea about how I could salvage the bike without paying for a new wheel?
I live in Amsterdam but second hand racing wheels aren't easy to find,

Should I try to search online?

Should I search for parts?

Should I look into converting it into a fixie?

tl;dr
I want this bike fixed for as little money as possible, what do?

He was sponsored so the chain/sprockets/cables were replaced fairly regularly. 

He rode around 2000-3000 km /year on it. 

What should I look for before buying it? Should I just stay away?

1364850440.0	1bgf9m	Issue replacing Shimano UN52 with UN55	silentflight10	8	0	11	"Last fall I bought a used 200? Kona Lanai to be my winter commuter. The bottom bracket had started clicking and grinding over the past month and I was hoping it would last until spring (which hasn't really arrived yet in Winnipeg) but last week it just fell apart. I pulled it out and found that it was a BB-UN52. One of the ball bearings was also broken in half.

So I bought a UN55 from my LBS and it threads into the drive side just fine, but the left side cup won't go in properly. It feels like the threading is not right, although it looks the same as the cup from the 52. And of course the 52 is a bit narrower so I can't use that cup with the 55. Any ideas on where to go from here?

UPDATE: I got it to a point where I couldn't even get it out again, so I brought it to Bikes and Beyond and they figured out the shell threads were stripped. Ended up getting a press fit bottom bracket installed. I can at least keep the UN55 as spare for my better bike, where I will be more careful about cleaning the threads before replacing :P"	t5_2sje0	True
1364829798.0	1bfd3r	Can a Contaminated Pad/Disk Cause a Spongy Brake Lever (Hydraulic) When Standing Still?	YouWillHaveThat	8	2	5	"::SOLVED::

I dropped my bike off at the LBS this morning with a hydraulic brake lever that would easily pull back to the grip, even when standing still.  If I lift the nose of the bike up and quickly pump the lever, I can get pressure back for a while, but it eventually fades away.  

They are now telling me that the pad and rotor are contaminated and that this is causing the sponginess.  However, I do not understand how a greasy pad and disc can cause a soft lever when the bike isn't moving and how pumping the lever fixes the the problem temporarily.

Am I being taken for a fool?

NOTE:  They originally quoted me a Brake Bleed, but now say that this will not solve the problem.

NOTE:  Shimano BR-M505

UPDATE:  Looks like I let my cynical side get the best of me.  They bled the brakes FREE OF CHARGE, kicked $10 off of a $20 wheel true because it ""wasn't that bad,"" and took the time to explain to me what was going on.

While he fixed the ""spongy"" feeling in the brakes with the bleed (again, for free), they still don't have much bite because of the contamination (he pulled a new one off the rack to show me the difference).  New pads and rotor will be here before the weekend, special ordered WITH NO DEPOSIT.

The good news is that with the 2013 Shimano RD-5701 GS rear derailleur you can use an 11-32 cassette with 105 (why Shimano doesn't publicize this more is beyond me).

Trouble is, I can't seem to find a good source for the full group.  The LBS's I've called (Denver/Boulder Colorado area) are either too cool for 105, or don't acknowledge the existence of the newer mid-cage RD, or because it would be ""custom"" from their standard 105 offering they would like to charge full MSRP or at least a substantial premium over their ""kit in a box"" pricing.  There are sellers on eBay but that makes me nervous for a relatively large purchase with a lot of parts like this.

The brakes are center pulls: http://ladyfleur.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/bottechia-head-badge-close.jpg?w=645

I quickly replaced the brake pads, but that hasn't helped very much. I tightened the cables, but even with the pads right next to the wheel to start, when i do a full brake, it's pretty lame.

I definitely need to re-cable, and I think that might help, but I'm wondering if I should replace the brake levers with more modern style ones. I figure that might result in more pulling power? I'm not sure what the frames are made out of, but I think that even though the brake pads are new, there might be certain pads more suited to the material.

What are your thoughts? Ideally, I'd like to not spend that much money here, but I wouldn't mind dropping $30 or so. Cables seem to be ~10 and new brake levers are $20 at the shop nearby.

I looked back and my feeble little white boy heart sunk, my rear derailer was dangling by the chain.

I'm riding a 9 speed [Orbea Carpe H30](http://www.orbea.com/gb-en/bicycles/carpe-h30/) with a Shimano Acera rear derailleur. I took the wheels off to clean the bike down yesterday and this morning something strange is happening.

Even when prepared for it I lose my balance a bit as the resistance is so much less when it drops to the low gear.

Does this sound familiar to anyone?

If it helps any, when shifting down through the gears there is no problem.

My problem is that there is a lot of gear noise coming from the chain and cassette. My other wheel also has an Ultegra cassette and it runs almost silently (especially just after it's been cleaned). 

The lock ring is plenty tight (I don't have a torque wrench, but I don't dare go much tighter) and there is no play in any of the cogs as far as I can tell. 

The wheel came with a little spacer washer that I didn't put in since the cassette came with its own. On a potentially similar note, I have to adjust the derailurer about a quarter to a half turn compared to my other wheel. Is it normal for two wheels to be slightly wider or narrower requiring derailuer adjustment?

I'm embarrassed to take my new wheelset out on group rides because of how noisy it is! Any suggestions?

I recently took my 1999 Mongoose D40R apart, cleaned (but did not service) all parts, and replaced all cables and am now encountering a problem with the rear derailleur not clearing the largest cog when shifting - the derailleur arm wants to shift inward but is not open enough and rides against the larger cog instead of shifting. All other shifting works fine including shift down from the largest cog after I've manually caused the rear derailleur to shift to it (i.e. pushed it in and opened it up). Chain length is proper and no slack in derailleur cable at any setting. All H/L screw settings seem fine and this is the same derailleur I had before I replaced the cables. Any ideas why it's not working after replacing the cable? Thanks in advance.

I've got a Tiagra 4603 Chainring, Shimano 105 5700 rear cassette (10 speed), Microshift derailleurs, branded as Nashbar [front](http://www.nashbar.com/bikes/Product_10053_10052_167465_-1___202434) and [rear](http://www.nashbar.com/bikes/Product_10053_10052_169985_-1___202435) with the same branded [brifters](http://www.nashbar.com/bikes/Product_10053_10052_168995_-1___202436) and currently a KMC Chain.  Previously the chain was a Shimano 105, intended to be mated with the 10 speed rear cassette.  It broke into 3 pieces within 2 blocks.

The KMC Chain has done a bit better as it lasted 1 17 mile ride, then started to fray apart on the link about 1 mile into my second ride.  I limped to the bike shop, and they put a new master link in, bringing this chain to 2 master links.

Later, I did notice that the rear derailleur is misaligned between the highest and lowest gear on the cassette.  This happens regardless of front derailleur positioning. The rear derailleur High and Low adjustment is spot on.  I'm 90% certain that cable tension is correct.  I guess this leaves the derailleur hanger as suspect.

However, I am debating a hub still.  My initial thought would be go with a reliable Shimano 105, however, I've seen several touring/heavy rider builds (such as Surly's long haul trucker) using Shimano Deore/XT Hubs for their wheels.

It appears to be of late 60's to mid 70's vintage.  Once it has been cleaned and repaired; I would to use it as a daily commuter (6 km/3.7 mi round trip), with some grocery getting on the weekends.

It has been sitting untouched in an underground parking lot for at least 10 years if not more, and is DIRTY.  There is light surface rust on all of the chrome surfaces, and the tires appear to be rotted through as well.  Mechanically it seems sound, except for three broken spokes on the rear wheel.

Im planning to clean and lube up the bike, as well as replacing the rotten tires with Conti Ultra Sport 27x1 1/4"" Tires, Mr.Tuffy tire liners; and replacing the rotten handlebar grips with Fizik handlebar tape with gel pads.  I will replace the brake cables, shift cables and liners as well as the cables where exposed are rusty as well.

Before I can order the parts and materials that I need, I want to know if I should source spokes and nipples to replace the broken ones on the rear wheel; or if I should hunt down a new/used aluminum 700c wheel set that is either compatible with my existing freewheel, or can be re-laced to my existing rear hub.

The parts on the bike as I recieved it are:
Headset: Carnielli
Handlebars: Aluminum drop-bars with rotting black foam grips
Downtube Shifters: Suntour Power Shifter
Derailleurs: Campy
Cranks: Unknown cottered cranks (Can't see any markings)

1341713511.0	w7dae	Yesterday my chain started to get stuck in between the big and small front chainrings every time shifting the front derailleur.	wantstoremoveagcoat	7	0	9	"I got it unstuck, but it will not shift properly any more.  It lands between the chainrings and gets jammed by pedaling.  I don't know what causes this.

Update 1:
Chain pic: http://i.imgur.com/JheYm.jpg
Nothing is obviously bent or loose.  There seems to be a consensus building that the space between the chainrings is too wide.  The small chainring does flare out just slightly- away from the large chainring.  Should it be like that or might they have installed in backwards, albeit it's curious for that to happen in the mid-80s and not to noticed until I rode it since the bike's always been with family.

Also it may be related to the distance between the lowest part of the derailleur and the big chainring as it is about 4.5mm.

Update 2:  [Edit:I THOUGHT] Problem was fixed with a quick derailleur calibration.  *facepalm*
I'm still considering moving the whole derailleur down by about 2mm just to optimize the shifting.

Thanks everyone for contributing your insights.  Upvotes for everyone!

Update 3: Test ride resulted in a some successful riding with shifting, but eventual failure.  Took bike to bicycle co-op.  Fiddled with front derailleur for an hour.  Moved front derailleur down on the seat tube by 2mm.  Still has the same problem.  A few guesses that the people there and I made:

The front derailleur cable is not installed properly- with bends that are much, much too sharp resulting in too much friction.  Will post pics tomorrow.  The chainrings are bent apart from each other.  They don't look obviously bent.  However this is a popular theory.  The small chainring does flare away from the large.  Might it be installed backwards?  Seems unlikely that if so, a problem wouldn't crop up until 25 years later.  Might be bent thou.  Will post pics tomorrow of the outward flair.  The teeth might be too worn, unlikely, as they aren't really so badly worn.  The chain might be too worn.  The chain might be the wrong size.  I will ask the bike owner if they've ever changed the chain.  They didn't mention it the last time I asked if they'd ever replaced any parts, thou.  The chain might be too long.

The most popular theory at the bike co-op was that replacing the front derailleur cable with a new one, installed properly this time, will greatly improve shifting and may solve the problem.  Also, that the chainrings may have been bent farther apart from the chain jamming in between them, and they may need to be bent back in using pliers, or by separating the chainring and banging it straight.  One guy told me he'd never seen this happen before.  No one really knows what's causing it.  So I'm asking you all."	t5_2sje0	True

In the last few months I've been having increasing problems with brake squeal in the front. Stopping power is still acceptable, though I avoid hard braking because the squeal is really annoying.

I've cleaned pads &amp; rims numerous times, re-adjusted pads with toe-in. Just last night I trued the wheel and  replaced the Kool-Stop dual-compound pads with new Shimano BR-M770 shoes (stock pads). This has only increased the squeal. I'm pretty confident that the pads are properly positioned.

I noticed when replacing the shoes that the brake arms have a bit of play. With the retaining bolt tightened as much as possible, I can still wiggle the arms a bit.

Is this play normal, or is it indicative of worn bushings? Other than ensuring proper headset adjustment (cable stop hanger is on the steerer tube), can you suggest other possible causes of squealing?

Edit 1: Tried a different wheel. Squeal was reduced but not eliminated. I suspect the wheel normally in use has low overall tension and this may be exacerbating the problem. Next step: more playing with pad positioning, double-checking headset adjustment.

Edit 2: Now that new pads have worn in a bit, squealing is much reduced. Thanks for all the help."	t5_2sje0	True

Other than that everything ran smoothly. The bike doesn't even appear to have too many miles on it, based on appearance and lack of significant tire wear.

Is there any standard maintenance I should do on a 3-4 year old bike with probably under 1000 miles, like removing and cleaning the hubs, to make sure that the bike is running at it's best? Or would anything more than the bare minimum, like chain lubrication, be a waste of time until it gets a few more miles?

For those of you who are also doing this for the first time, a few things I've learned (and I haven't actually assembled anything yet).

* When you buy your frame, immediately inspect it to see if you need some simple (yet critical) things, like a seat post clamp, front derailleur clamp, or other small attachment/hangars.

* When working on any ""piece"" of the bike, make sure you have everything you need before you start.

* Don't try to install a headset and cut the steerer tube until you have spacers and a stem.

* Don't forget to have cables on hand when you are assembling the derailleurs and brakes.

I'm starting assembly next week, bringing the headset/frame/fork/spacers/stem to the LBS and learning from the wrench there how to install the headset, measure the steerer and cut to length. Then it's off to the workshop and I'm on my own (other than QA here).

1321498039.0	mf75b	Well, I broke a spoke...	hilo	7	0	22	"I have a Rockhopper Pro from 2001.  Riding home in the cold tonight I hear a distinct pop/twang/thud and figure it is a broke spoke.  Being only a block from my house I just keep listening to make sure there is no mechanical interference taking place and rode on home.  Upon inspection my suspicions where confirmed in that I have a broke spoke on my rear wheel.  My questions are are as follows:  Can I continue riding the bike for my commute w/o causing damage short term? Long term? Can/does this indicate a larger problem with my wheel?  How important is one spoke to the overall strength of the wheel?  Will one spoke failing cause a domino effect of failures to adjacent spokes?  Do spokes have an expected useful lifespan, or do you just replace as needed? Lastly, as someone who does minor bike adjustments and maintenance can I perform a replacement of the spoke or should I leave wheel work to the pros?

edit:  [Here is my bike from a day before spoke break '11.](http://imgur.com/a/OWxij#0)

edit 2: New shit has come to light: I did drop the chain into the spokes about a month ago for the first time.  I just went to go inspect the spoke in the daylight and it broke a few mm from the hub, not an inch as I previously indicated.  It is a drive side, pulling spoke. I also quick tested the tension on the remaining spokes and noticed that the spokes on the non-drive side at the point of the failed spoke are somewhat loose. The spokes on the drive side seem to have the same tension while the spokes on the non-drive side seemed to have more variation in their tensions, however this is slight.

Update: Rode my bike to campus this morning and noticed that the wheel was definitely untrue when I was on the bike.  Took the bike to the bike shop next to campus that I have done some business with in the past and they got me fixed up for $18 which included a truing of the wheel, a spoke, and a nipple.  Went and picked it up after class and rode it all day.  I felt somewhat at ease riding the 3 miles to campus and then the shop based on the anecdotes given here, however I did take it easy. Bike mechanic at the shop said the wheel could last me a long time if I wasn't too hard on it but he suggested that I start thinking about replacing both wheel based on the difficulty in truing the rear wheel and the wear on the brake surfaces of both.  Anyway, based on the input here I won't be surprised if I start getting a few more failures and at that point I'll probably replace the wheel sets. At that point I will be back here for recommendations b/f a purchase occurs. Thanks everyone."	t5_2sje0	True

Short version: my front disc brake ""works"" but has very little stopping power and squeals extremely loudly. By ""little stopping power"" I mean I can hold down the (hydraulic) brake lever and still keep pedaling and moving, with some effort (and wake up the neighbors at the same time).
Long version: I bought this bike new two weeks ago and it's my first hydraulic brake system and my first disc brake system. I took it out for a ride last week and it worked great, but I noticed some occasional rubbing against the disc so I fiddled with it afterward. Being a hydraulic noob I loosened a screw I shouldn't have and squirted out mineral oil (oops) and sucked air into the hydraulics. I took it to the LBS today and the kind mechanic bled my brakes for me, which I figured would resolve any problems and I just took it home.
Now the hydraulics seem fine and the brake lever feels solid, but when I depress it while riding I get an extremely loud squeal and it only puts up some minor resistance, not nearly the kind of braking power I had when I took it out last week.
I will of course take it back to the LBS tomorrow but they're pretty swamped and I'm taking this bike with me on a trip on Friday, so I'm on a tight schedule. Does anyone have any ideas of what might be wrong? It would be extremely helpful. Thank you.

But instead of fixed I was thinking of building up a bike with just a rear mech (10 speed 105/ultegra) and front bar end shifter and a 50 or 53 ring up front.

Also how compatible are modern wheels and cassettes with steel frames? I already have a spare set of brakes, will they cause a problem on a steel frame?

I shall buy most of the stuff from classifieds (anyone know of any other bike classifieds in the UK other than bikerader?) and ebay, but I'll probably end up buying the bar end shifter, brake levers and bars new as I rarely see them popping up in classifieds.

Hello Friends I hope this will be helpful to someone out there!

I have a older frame that came without mounts for my new hydraulic brake cables. I tried to remedy the situation for a while with some zip-ties but they kept coming loose against the frame and my cables would slide around.

I came up with a cheap solution that works so well that I thought I would share it with you!

Line a bunch of zip-ties on some old cardboard and spray the underside of the zip-tie, that will contact the frame, with a few passes of the magic spray.
