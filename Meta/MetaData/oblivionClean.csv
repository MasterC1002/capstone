- The guild missions in Oblivion are *amazing*. Every quest line is worth doing because they're so immersive. Skyrim guild missions are nowhere near as engaging.

- I miss making my own spells and the spells that you have access to are so much more varied in Oblivion.

- Being able to use a sword and shield *and* still cast spells in Oblivion. A battlemage in Oblivion is far more formiddable than they are in Skyrim, because in Skyrim they can't block so you can just hack away at them til they're done.

- I really feel like they dumbed down skyrim a lot to make it more appealing to casual gamers, so it's easy to do well when playing the game. In Oblivion you literally had to master stuff to do well against most enemies.

Does anyone else feel this way? What do you guys think could be taken from Oblivion and applied to the next TES game?

Edit - Thanks for the response everyone, seems like a lot of you agree and mentioned stuff I hadn't thought of before. A lot of people mentioned Oblivion being a watered down Morrowind, so I'm thinking maybe I didn't give it a fair enough chance, time to go back and give it another go."	t5_2qs10	True

 The End was awesome and had a great plottwist and surprises in it!(Still waiting for the Imperial Dragon Armor). 
 I've also played the Knights of the Nine expansion, what was fantastic overall, except Umaril the Unfeathered could have been more powerful.
 I have also completed the Arena quest, it was really cool, hearing the people cheer, when I had slain The Gray Prince. 
 As for the world of Cyrodiil it is way more colorfull and more beautifull than Skyrim. 
 I personally think Oblivion is better in some things than Skyrim, although the leveling system should have been better in Oblivion.
 In overall I'm happy that I purchased Oblivion(5th Anniversary Edition) and to the many things that will come. "	t5_2qs10	True

1276194099.0	cdmzf	The Reddit Beginner's Guide to Modding Oblivion.	MeldingPlague	94	12	187	"**REQUIREMENT!!!**

[OBSE](http://obse.silverlock.org/) - Oblivion Script Extender is required for a large number of user generated mods to work.

**Keep it Organized!**

* Oblivion Mod Manager - [TESN](http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2097) - Keep your mods organized and in OMOD form, a file format unique to OBMM. Easily turn mods on and off without having to edit your Oblivion/Data folder. A must!

**Stabilize Oblivion!**

* Unofficial Oblivion Patch - [TESN](http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=5296) | [PES](http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=oblivionmods.detail&amp;id=1417) - Fixes a great number of bugs and errors in vanilla Oblivion.

* Unofficial Shivering Isles Patch - [TESN](http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=10739) | [PES](http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=OblivionMods.Detail&amp;id=2754) - Fixes a great number of bugs and errors in the Shivering Isles expansion pack.

* Unofficial Oblivion Mods Patch - [TESN](http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=9969) | [PES](http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=OblivionMods.Detail&amp;id=2384) - Fixes a great number of bugs in the official mods/add-ons released by Bethesda.

**UI &amp; Gameplay Changes**

* DarNified UI - [TESN](http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=10763) | [PES](http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=OblivionMods.Detail&amp;id=2764) - The unmodded UI for Oblivion is an offense to the sensibilities of the grizzled veteran PC gamer. DarN fixes all of that, though, giving you the rich UI experience that you, the discerning gamer, so deserves. The changes are like day and night! Also, check out the dark version over at [TESN](http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=11280) or [PES](http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=OblivionMods.Detail&amp;id=2897)!

* Oblivion XP - [TESN](http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=15619) | [PES](http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?id=4425&amp;view=OblivionMods.Detail) - Completely changes the way you level and gain experience in Oblivion. Get XP for killing NPCS, picking locks, making new potions and more! Visit the link for a complete list of how XP is calculated by the creator. Highly recommended if you have ever wished that Oblivion leveled like a traditional RPG.

* Alternative Start by Ship - [TESN](http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=11495) - The tutorial mission, while helpful for those new to Oblivion, can be a long and repetitive task for those familiar to the game and simply wanting to create a new character. This mod starts you in the Waterfront district and adds additional customization to your character. This customization dictates the kind of resources that will be contained in your belongs which can be found in a sack next to the player once the character creation process is over.

* Quest Award Leveller - [TESN](http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=5701) | [PESN](http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=OblivionMods.Detail&amp;id=1546) - Some quest reward items are scaled in Oblivion, meaning that if you finish a quest early on you might get the level 1-5 version of an item rather than the more powerful level 10-15 version of the same item if you had waited to finish said quest until later. Quest Reward Leveller makes those items level with you while also opening options for customization.

**I Need Everything to Look Better, Though!**

* Natural Environments - [TESN](http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2536) | [PES](http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=oblivionmods.detail&amp;id=376) - A great mod that adds all sorts of major and minor changes. For example, there is a completely new and varied weather system. The underwater vision has been redefined. Birds and insects are nwo visible flying around overhead and fluttering about in front of you!

* Natural Environments OBMM File - [TESN](http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=10257) - When you turn your average mod into an OMOD, there can be compatibility issues or fewer choices available than if you had manually installed it. This is because most OMODs come with an OBMM instructional file that tells OBMM to ask you, at activation of the mod, what kind of features from the mod you want to install. By following the instructions for installing this OBMM instructional file into the Natural Environments mods you download prior to turning it into an OMOD (if you choose to do so), you will have the stability of an OMOD mixed with the customization of a manually installed mod. Perfect mod harmony for a great mod.

* Unique Landscapes Compilation - [TESN](http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=19370) | [PES](http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=OblivionMods.Detail&amp;id=5172) - There are a lot of mods that make minor changes to the land of Cyrodiil. Some include giant castes. Others boast enormous dungeons. There are even kinky underworld mods! This collection, however, is more subtle. It adds some interesting places to visit to the wilderness. The new locations are displayed on the map but must first be visited in order to fast travel.

* Bananasplit Better Cities - [TESN](http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=16513) - The TESnexus description tells you everything about the experience level required to install this mod. If you are new to modding Oblivion files, you may want to shy away from this mod at first as it can cause serious texture flaws if installed incorrectly. Come back to it once you have a good understanding of modding and its inner workings. You won't be disappointed.

* Landscape LOD Texture Replacer - [TESN](http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=2182) - Reduces the amount of big blocky textures in the distance. Can cause significant slowdown if your computer is not up-to-date.

**But, MeldingPlague, Tell Me About Titty Mods**

Okay!

* HG EyeCandy - [TESN](http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=15802) - Despite the number of nudey screenshots on this mod page, there is actually a clothed option which you will be prompted to choose (if you so desire) upon OMOD activation. If you opt for the ""surprise, I was raised in a nudist colony"" route, though, there is an option to choose breast and butt size.

* Robert's Male Models - [TESN](http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=25365) | [PES](http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=OblivionMods.Detail&amp;id=5655) - If naked females aren't exactly your thing, however, why not try Robert's Male Models to make the men of Oblivion sport a more realistic physique? Warning: Beans and franks are present. Also, hilarious. And uncircumcised.

I looked for info on the matter, and I found 2 documentaries about the development of both games.

I'll also posted this on /r/skyrim/ because I wanna know what their opinion too: http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/y9dmy/i_think_bethesda_is_going_the_wrong_way/

Skyrim is great, but Oblivion is better in many aspects.
Mainly, the quests. In oblivion, they are more complex, they made you think.
In skyrim, (apart from the main quest lines) most are fetch quests. Listen to this NPC: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw7aCFQqQ8M#t=1544s

Now, this might be the reason:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw7aCFQqQ8M#t=1500s

""A lot of these repeat, because they're Radiant"" - Radiant is the AI ,introduced in Oblivion. 
To me, this means quests have less variety, as opposed to the hand-crafted stories in Oblivion. 
This makes it easier to include missions and more importantly, easier to polish.

Now, look at the release dates:
Oblivion: March, 2006
Fallout 3: October, 2008
Skyrim: November, 2011
Which means, they probably didn't have that much more time to spend making Skyrim.

And the dungeons. In skyrim, they are very linear (with a few exceptions). Generally with 2 levels, and at the end, a mini-boss and a secret passage to take you to the entrance.

The worst part is how they were developed. Look at the diference:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWvbVhfWnK0#t=357s

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw7aCFQqQ8M#t=1606s


So, it sounds like Todd Broadwater (the guy with the CRT monitor on the first video), is better at this than dedicated level desingners! (My opinion)

He did not work in skyrim, and apparently worked in Kingdoms of Amalur: http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Todd_Broadwater
I know it wasn't just him who made the levels in Oblivion, it's just an example.

This, and the huge success of Skyrim, tell me that Bethesda is really moving away from Oblivion, and I think it is such a shame :(

I haven't played the skyrim DLC, but I have no reason to believe it's any different from the main game.
What are your thoughts? If you disagree, don't just downvote! I want to hear other opinions.
Also, Morrowind. If you played it, what do you think?

It has driven me nuts. D:
So, I just completed the last thieves guild quest for S'Krivva and traveled to the Imperial City to gather some goods to fence. With OOO, the minimal crime gold for the first Gray Fox quest is set to 5000, so it took quite some raids to the houses of the unsuspecting merchants in the market district to get enough goods. Tons of magical items and lots of alchemy gear, food, books, even decoration items such as plates etc. were stolen. When I travelled to Orrin to sell him my stolen goods, I already noticed something was off. I had the weird vibe I was going to get a gamecrash. When I sold my items, my suspicions came true: Immediate gamecrash when I tried to quicksave after I sold him my stuff. This always occured, no matter if i wanted to quicksave, name save or auto save by leaving the Anvil castle smithy. Trying to solve the issue, I deactivated mods, looked on the internet, looked into the oblivion.ini, but I couldnt find anything that would cause that bug to happen.
What I tried to do then is to sell small amounts of goods and look where it would crash. Weirdly, mod items would sell just fine ( I thought if it was a specific item, it had to be a mod item, right?), potions, weapons and armor, too. It kept crashing though whenever I tried to sell my stolen food. Narrowing the candidates down, I noticed it always crashed when I sold a single orange. YES, A DAMN ORANGE. That orange managed to singlehandedly crash my game over and over. Fuck you, oranges. You are truly annoying."	t5_2qs10	True

I equipped Fin Gleam and stayed on the bottom as I swam, so even though she was faster she had to keep coming up for air. I swam to the stables, and managed to get to the bridge leading into the Talos Plaza district. From there, I managed to avoid her by jumping around the braziers that are periodically placed along the bridge while my magicka recharged, and using Heal Minor Wounds. Once I got into the city, I ran around the dragon statue's base in the city square while she fruitlessly tried to follow. She ended up getting blasted by about a dozen city guards. I can't imagine that's how I was supposed to do that, but it felt pretty cool once the clusterfuck of guards all simultaneously sheathed their swords and left her corpse for me to loot.

The incident was apparently witnessed while the source was attempting to contact another member of the Bruma Guard for purposes undisclosed to this reporter.

Unfortunately, they had him backed into a corner and killed him before she could intervene.

I was pretty upset at this. Pielight, who had hilariously low agility at the time, knew all too well the pain of being stagger-locked in a corner by creatures half her height. So, after asphyxiating the culprits with an area lifedrain spell, she borrowed the late guard's silver sword and proceeded to eviscerate every fucker in the mine with it.

She chewed through her repair hammers not even halfway through. Her armor got beaten to hell, but she sucked it up and kept going. The sword finally shattered with the killing blow to the last mob she came across -- the tribe's [chef](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Goblins#Sharp_Tooth_Tribe).

It's a motherfucking unicorn, headed straight the fuck at me, with the sole goal of fucking my shit all up, that's what.

I manage to outmaneuver them both while picking off the minotaur with my deft bowhunting skills, but guess the fuck what? UNICORNS ARE IMMUNE TO WEAPONS! So I try out my fledgling destruction magic, to no avail. Beast Tongue? Not a fucking chance. Unicorn lands a staggering blow, decimating my poor little wood elf's HP, at which point I hightail it to Bravil, hoping the city guard will bail my ass out of this predicament.

No such luck.

The unicorn follows my ass across the fucking bridge to the city gate, guards twiddling their thumbs all the while, so I dive off into the water below. Swim out to the nearest shore and hear the music change back to the normal fare and take a relieved breath.

Go back up to head into Bravil and my unicorn friend is waiting for me on the bridge. Except he doesn't want to kill me. Wait a second, can I ride this thing...?

HOLY SHIT I AM NOW THE UNICORN MASTER!

Or at least for half a mile when we encounter some bandits, and after curb-stomping some orc skull, he decides he doesn't like me anymore and takes me out in 2 hits.

I thought this was really creepy. After she left the store I followed her, hoping she would go dig up a grave or something, but she didn't. I even broke into her house but found no signs of necrophilist acts.

1320692588.0	m3sq3	The Skingrad Massacre: A Tribute to Oblivion	dkevinscalf	54	14	8	"From the darkness my sword slashed.

The vampire shrieked and fell in a cloud of dust. The people of Skingrad could live free of the threat of these undead monsters that looked so human. The Count of Skingrad would be relieved as well.

His secret was safe with me.

The vampire hunters who had been called here were another matter. Should they discover the Count's... 'condition', it would mean ill tidings for Skingrad, but more importantly it would jeopardize my position with the Mage's Guild.

Archmage Traven had word that Count Janus Hassildor had valuable information pertaining to the necromancers who had plagued all of Tamriel of late.  This information was vital enough to risk my life, or un-life, to hunt these abominations.

I emerged from the cavern just as the sun was setting and made the short journey back to Skingrad. Being late in the day, I sought the hunters at the Two Sisters Lodge near the east gate.

It was not difficult to find them. A large man with close cropped, military hair was shouting for another tankard of ale. The short, Orcish innkeep, Mog was patiently attending to her guests needs, but an air of repressed hostility crept about her like a morning fog. Who could tell when the bestial rage of her kind would finally well up and snap her into action? I did not intend to stay very long. I approached the drunken mercenary.

""Hmm. You don't look like a vampire..."" he growled over the foam of his ale. ""How about you just keep walking?""

""I wish to discuss that very issue, I have-"" I began before he half rose from his chair.

""Look, I'm just here to do my job! If you have business with us, talk to Eridor!"" 

""As you wish"" Mog was stirring behind the bar. I vacated the tavern floor and ascended the stairs. No reason to inflame a drunkard or an Orcish woman at the end of her patience.

As I topped the stairs I heard muffled voices. One voice seemed to have a tone of elegant finality. This must be who I sought.

I knocked and entered and was presented with three men; a bold looking Nord with white hair and a chest as big as an ale barrel, a lanky Redguard whose manner bespoke a predatory beast, and a refined looking wood elf with sleek black hair in a top knot. The elf sported a large battle axe that looked to be as tall as he, though something about the man gave me the impression that he was more than up to the task of wielding it. This was Eridor. He addressed me tiredly.

""Oh no, not another one."" he cleared his throat. ""Ahem.. Citizen of.. Skingrad, please be advised that I am here on official business, and wish no harm.. Oh, forget it! Let me guess.. You are wondering what my men and I are doing here in town, right?""

Feeling this would go quicker if I simply assented, I said yes.

""You have my assurance that my men and I will do everything in our power to keep the people of.. Skingrad safe. We're here to help."" his tone did nothing to hide his contempt for what he plainly viewed as a backwater village. He continued his rehearsed proclamation.

""If you have seen anything unusual, particularly anything implying the presence of the undead in town, please report it at once.""

We had arrived at the point at long last. ""Indeed I do have information. I have killed the vampires nesting at Bloodcrust Cavern.""

If Eridor was shocked he masked it well. ""And what? I'm supposed to take your word for it? Sorry friend, but I will need some sort of proof.""

I produced a handful of the vampire dust that had clung to every line and facet of my armor that day. For the first time in the conversation, his pleasant smile faded.

""Damned amateurs! You people should leave it to the professionals!"" he growled at me.

""Very well"" I intoned and with a small nod I made my exit. I could hear muffled arguments among Eridor and his men as I made my way downstairs to book a room.

The next morning I awoke expecting to find the hunters long gone, yet there they were, all around Skingrad still inquiring as to the presence of vampires. What more must I do to make them leave? 

I sought Eridor near the temple in the south of town. 

""Oh hello, citizen. Do you have any more information for me?"" he asked somewhat distractedly.

""Is your task not finished here, hunter?"" I asked bemusedly. He thought a moment before responding.

""It's not as if I don't trust your.. skill. It's just that when Eridor of the Bosmer is contracted he sees it through to the very end. There is still the scent of a vampire around this town and I mean to root it out! Good day!"" and with that he turned and entered the temple, perhaps to consecrate a holy relic used to ward off the undead.

For three days I remained in Skingrad watching the hunters and for three days they crept closer and closer to the secret lying within the castle. If they were to discover the very Count of Skingrad were a vampire the mob would have him before nightfall and any chance of the guild discovering the den of these foul necromancers would be gone forever. 

I had no choice but to act.

The morning of my fourth day in Skingrad, I donned a thin garb enchanted and weaved with spells to make me undetectable by the unaided eye. I crept downstairs to the street and I waited.

Around noon, the hunters left the inn for the last time.

Just a whispered word on the wind and I had bewitched Eridor's Nordic brother. His eyes rolled up until the whites showed and he let out a roar of anguished rage unsheathing his sword.

""Really, Carsten what has gotten into-?"" Eridor cut off as he barely dodged a heavy swing of the blade. ""Now really, man! Stop this at once!""

A Skingrad city watchman had been passing by and at the first shout had come running over.

""What is the meaning of this?"" he shouted drawing his blade. He had gotten his shield up just in time as the brutal Nord came down with a crushing blow. The soldier’s surprise turned to focused anger. ""I've fought mud crabs bigger than you!"" the solider taunted as he sallied back and forth with the enraged Nord. Two more city watch joined in one of them fitting arrows to his bow even as he ran. 

Still unseen, I scrambled up to the balcony of inn to watch events unfold. Eridor was lying in the gutter clutching an arrow shaft buried deep in his bowels. The drunken merc and the Redguard had emerged from the inn now and were rushing to the aid of their dying leader and the beastly Nord.

A city watchman went to one knee a wound across his chest and shoulders. I whispered again and the wound mended its self and the man fought with renewed vigor.

Several townsfolk had joined in the fight; apparently good will to these visitors had run out. Mog had run out of the inn with a kitchen knife and was trying her hardest to jam it between the drunken merc's ribs. 

When the dust had settled, the hunters were lying dead in the streets of Skingrad along with a watchman and.. The Nine wept! Gaston Surilie had at some point joined the fray and was staring glassy eyed into the morning sky his brother weeping and cursing the very air. 

Too appropriately, he was staring straight through me.

I reported the hunters’ deaths to Count Hassildor, and learned invaluable information about the necromancers, but that is a tale for another day. 

From that time, a bottle of Surilie Brothers wine has always been able to transport me to that fateful day.

One time a few Imperial ambassadors with a contingent of guards came through the small farm where he grew up in High Rock and for days all he could think about was how regal they all seemed, like gods among men. Having been a Breton and the son of a part time healer for his village Francois had a bit of skill in magic and even a bit of swordplay from fantasizing with the other kids about one day being a member of the legendary Blades. 

Finally the day came when he could put those skills to work and realize his dream. With the little that his family was able to scrounge up he made his way down to Daggerfall to find passage to Cyrodiil. He passed all the tests with flying colors and a few weeks later found himself in Anvil. Finally, there it was. So what if it didn't look entirely Imperial, he was still there. In Cyrodiil. He could hardly believe it. 

HE rose through the ranks fairly quickly and became one of his captains most trusted men. He had a certain rustic charisma to him that the Imperials found refreshing. He swore away shields and heavier armor as he ""Can't get out of the way of things quickly enough."" Some didn't care for his dealings with the undead and Daedra but he was a fierce worshipper of the Nine and swore away all Daedra worhsip. Perhaps what his captain liked best though was that Francois could be sent on a mission with almost no supplies and be perfectly all right. Which is why he was chosen to head up a scouting mission along the road between Leyawiin and Bravil.

That's where it all went wrong though. Francois had five men with him to simply guard a tax shipment along the road where the next group would pick it up. But in his passion for the Empire, Francois decided to not only defend the caravan but also to attack any perceived threats. He left four men behind to guard the caravan and took his best archer with him to scout ahead where he knew a Daedric shrine was. How could he pass up the opportunity to wipe this scum off the face of Nirn? He charged into their encampment only to find far more men than he anticipated whose ranks were quickly bolstered by a score of demons.

He barely managed to make it out alive though his archer was not so lucky. He returned to the caravan to find that a large group of bandits had overrun it in his absence. All the men were dead. The gold gone. He had no choice but to return to his captain, head hung low, and report of his failure. Needless to say he was tried and convicted of failure to follow orders among other charges. The next day he was thrown in the dungeon. His first time stepping foot inside the Imperial City and it was in shackles. Somehow he never lost faith in the Empire and swore to still uphold its name once he was released. Then one day someone visited his cell......."	t5_2qs10	True

Ok, so, maybe I'm a bit biased here, since Oblivion was my first real rpg AND Elder Scrolls game, but I thoroughly enjoyed Oblivion more than Skyrim. Much more. The landscapes in Oblivion seemed more impressive in 06 than Skyrim's did last year, and I liked the quests MUCH more in Oblivion, like the main quest and the guilds. I think I was so hyped for Skyrim over a span of 5 years that I was disappointed  with the outcome (though it's still a wonderful game.) Skyrim still DOES improve over some things Oblivion was flawed in, like how the world around you freezes when you talk to someone, and adds a sprint feature.

Lately though things have gotten a little stale, but I am still obsessed with the Elder Scrolls, so I decided to pick up the awesome deal on the GOTY Deluxe edition of TESIV: Oblivion on Steam. 

This game is very cool so far, I love the inter-connectivity of these games. All I have really done is escape prison (while sucking it up at lockpicking), visit Weynon Priory (while sucking it up at conversation) and save Kvatch from the horrible Oblivion monster (while actually doing fairly well in combat). 

So far, I love that spell-casting has it's own button, I'm really liking the hotkeys, and even though the graphics aren't as pretty as Skyrim, they seem like they must have been ahead of their time back when this came out.

What I am wondering is: what should I do next? Obviously this game is gigantic and there is so much to do (including built-in DLC like the Shivering Isles), but I have no idea what I am in for.

I had health potions, but I was saving them for the Kvatch mission. I began to wonder when was the last time I'd saved. (As you know, on the roads autosave doesn't happen much.)

Suddenly out of nowhere an Imperial Guard appears and begins slaughtering the troll. The thing lets out a wail and collapses, dead. I talked to him, hoping there was some way to thank him. (Of course there wasn't. There should be.)

Nehrim is ridiculously simple to install (install oblivion, download Nehrim installer, install Nehrim (and then make sure that the data files are selected)). I've modded Morrowind, and to a certain extent Oblivion, and in my opinion, neither was worth it as I was replaying the games, and falling into the same habits as before (and knowing where everything was, and what to do kindof took the fun out of it for me). I have played through Morrowind mutliple times, for the most part doing things differently, but to be honest, I get a little tired of the combat system (everything else is pretty damn awesome, and I'm still finding small little surprises) and the main story doesnt grip me like it did on the first playthrough.

SUPER_HITLER	34	1	6	"Knights of the Nine was a lot of fun, at first it was neat to hear the word spread about the different relics as I collected them, and ""You're the divine crusader!"" was neat the first few times I heard it, but since then I've completed the Fighter's Guild and the Thieves' guild and the NPCs still won't shut up about the events of Knights of the Nine.  
  
Even worse, I've since picked up some infamy, so I constantly get greeted with ""I used to think you were a hero. A holy knight and all that. I guess I should have known better,"" and ""I used to admire you. But it turns out you're just a sinner like all the rest of us"" over and over again.""  
  
Is there a mod that turns those ""You're not a hero anymore"" greetings off? They're getting really repetitive. I could wipe my infamy, but then ""Wow, you're the divine crusader!"" and variants would take their place, and that's not a whole lot better considering that 20+ in-game hours have taken place since I beat KoTN and I'm getting tired of hearing about it.

2. Have an idea what character build you want and stick to it. In oblivion, it's hard to be good at a lot of things. For instance, you can't be a sneaky stealth archer who can also pull out a heavy 2 handed war hammer with full heavy armor.

3. When Baurus gives you the option of selecting a class, always create your own.

4. Keep in mind the 7 skills you choose level up twice as fast and leveling them also levels you.

5. Sleep in a bed to level up.

6. Arrows drop in flight.

7. While using a one-handed weapon; block once, hit twice. repeat.

8. Save before collecting a sigil stone (located in oblivion gates). If you don't like its random enchantment, reload and repeat.

It feels so anticlimactic becoming the leaders of all of these guilds (Dark Brotherhood too), because there's very little benefit. When we were working our way up, the previous leaders of these guilds were telling us to complete tasks for them, why can't we do the same when we're in charge? 

As the Gray Fox you should be able to commission someone steal things for you. As the Fighters Guildmaster you should be able to take a horde of fighters into battle.

About 6 months ago I posted an imgur gallery of a mod I was working on, but never got around to finishing it, or even working on it these past 4 months. With school being out for the summer, I worked on it a little more, and decided to release what I had so far. It's unfinished, but for anyone who wanted to check it out, you're now more than welcome to.

I still have a file full of ideas suggested by you guys from my last post (which were great by the way, I'm going to try and stay on top of this and add all of them).

He says he wants to kill the Gatekeeper and I'm like, ""awesome, me too.""  So he fashions us up some arrows and we get to it.  Here's where I think I messed up.  You know when you are asked to make the choice between having Jayred hang back or follow you into battle with the Gatekeeper?  Well, I had him come along and he promptly gets killed.  Now, I must confess, I did loot him afterward and take the rest of his arrows but because I'm apparently not a skilled archer, I used them up and still didn't manage to best the beast.  Now I have no one else to make me those sweet Gatekeeper bone arrows and if that's the only way to kill him, I'm screwed.  

Here's where you all come in.  Are there other ways around this bastard?  Do I need to bring him a Milky Way or something?  Seriously.  I need to get past the wall.

1368749046.0	1ehhuk	Battlemage - Armor or no Armor?	mr_penguin	32	5	10	"I'm trying to come up with a character class for my next play through. I've played Oblivion once as a pure mage, an assassin and a barbarian-type warrior. Now I'd like to do an RP play through as an Altmer Battlemage (not the most optimal race I know, but I can compensate for the magic weakness).

I was thinking something along the lines of:
Magic Specialization  
Favored Attributes: Strength, Int  
Skills:  

* Alchemy
* Athletics (Need to be able to dodge/run fast)
* Blade (the battle part of battlemage)
* Destruction (My ranged attack, and for powerful touch spells)
* Alteration (Shields and to replace security)
* Mysticism (soul trap, detect life, etc)
* Illusion (To replace speechcraft, mercantile and for CC since I""ll be squishy)

I know the built-in premade battlemage class doesn't have an armor skill, and ideally I'd prefer to be at 100% spell effectiveness rather than a max of 95% from wearing armor. However, am I just going to gimp myself in melee combat by relying exclusively on alteration and being fast to dodge attacks?

I'd also like to squeeze in Conjuration, but not sure which magic school I can do without.

So, has anyone else tried this (or a very similar build)? What skills did you use and how squishy were you at later levels?

Really my motivation for making this type of build is I love mage characters, but I really hate not being able to use all the cool weapons and artifacts available in game (the same reason I can't immerse myself in Skyrim as a mage, everything is so clearly geared for melee/physical weapon characters). So I figured by doing a mix between mage and fighter (although more mage than fighter) I'd still be able to make use of the unique weapons and such.

1367001943.0	1d651g	soul trap Baenlin in Accidents happen	Kindadeadguy	32	4	11	"Okay guys, I have a bit of a problem. I am playing a psychotic wizard that wants to trap the souls of every human he kills for the brotherhood. I also take a personal item from each of my kills to enchant their souls into one of their own items and have them suffer forever. At the same time I like to imagine this pisses off the night mother and Sithis to no end since they can't get to their newly claimed souls.

So far Rufio and Gaston were no big deal, but now it's time for Baenlin.
Now, I still want the bonus, but I also want his soul. I have, however, hit a bit of a snag when I tried to get his soul. When I soul trap him he starts running around, and gets away from his seat. I have managed to get around this by making a spell that both paralyzes him and traps his soul, but still I don't get his soul after killing him with the bull's head. I've started suspecting that maybe the game just doesn't track his death when the bulls' head fall on top of him.

Now, I could get around this in two ways: I could just walk over to him, trap his soul and pump him full of napalm. Problem solved, bonus failed.

I could also kill him, lure his bodyguard out of the house, head back in and use either the staff of worms or risen flesh spell on him to trap him that way.

The first option is completely unsatisfactory, and the second one seems a little bit like cheating (although it does give me an excuse to finally head into the shivering Isles...)

#1: This was years ago on Xbox. Aylied ruin, I don't remember which one it was. I was a high-level character with basically the best of everything. I had explored nearly everything.
Most dungeons were the same for me, I run in, hack everything down, loot, and leave. This ruin was different though. I went in, empty. Not a single enemy, and I knew I had never been there before. Every single dark corner, every room, no one or thing to be found, and no bodies. It was simply eerie.
I went all the way through and grabbed one of those Aylied statues, I think. Suddenly, there were just zombies everywhere. That dungeon really stood out, just for that.

#2: I just got the game for PC recently, and I went into Sideways Cave. That place with the weird inscriptions and such. I had a darkness mod (Let There be Darkness) that makes ruins and such places pitch-black, except for placed lights. The place was full of annoying imps, and I just went through and slowly slaughtered them. I found myself near the entrance of an Aylied ruin in the cave, when I spot a troll. I leap onto a rock to keep at a safe distance and hack at it until my weapon breaks - but the thing's health just refills. All I had then were my claws and low-level hand-to-hand. I tried making a run into the Aylied ruin, with the thing barreling at high speeds behind me, with its horrifying breathing sounds. I get in and think ""Good thing they can't come through doors."" Bam, it appears right in the narrow corridor with me and begins to maul me to death. I frantically get out of the ruin through the same door and begin to run through the flooded cave with low health, low stamina, and no weapons. Mind that those things are incredibly fast, and my character is barely moving along. In one or two hits I could die too. The place is pitch black and I'm stumbling through the dark, trying to use night-eye and healing as my magicka diminishes. I make a mad sprint out of the cave and then outside, where I eventually lost the troll. I haven't been back there since."	t5_2qs10	True

1324907488.0	nr54n	"So I just bought Oblivion, and absolutely love it.
I hope you can help me with some beginner questions though.."	mxbR	29	2	14	"Alright, this game is amazing, I'm only a level 2 so far, but I enjoy it greatly.
My questions:

**Magicka** :


I play a Battlemage, so Magicka is quite important.
Only thing is, how do I regain it? Only through potions? At first I thought the bar would slowly fill up with time, but it doesn't.
It also fills up again after you sleep, I know that.
But potions are so expensive, which is why I wanted to ask if there's other ways.
Which leads me to the next Question:

**Gold** : 


As a beginner, how do I earn it the quickest?
Quests? I'm currently doing most of the quests for the Mageguild. But that doesn't earn me a lot of money, so most of the times, I take all the utensils for potions in the Mageguilds house, and sell them right there ... (I'm sure that's not how it's supposed to go though..)
Any other ways?

**Quests**: 


So my first was [this](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Breaking_the_Siege_of_Kvatch) one.
I couldn't beat it, because I 
* didn't have any strong spells
* good equipment 
so I started the Guild quests to get more experience. Came back yesterday, still can't beat it.
Not: my strongest spell at the time is the Fireball spell, from Destruction I think.
Also, I have one pretty shitty sword, and my armor is ok.
So what do I do to kill those little creatures on my way up to these towers, they seem way too strong for me!

**Magic Spells**:


There's so many spells, which spells, in your opionion are the most important ones?
Which spells should I use at the moment? How do I use them in combinations the best? Any fellow Battlemage here? :)

**Equipment**:


As a Battlemage what kind of armor should I wear?
Where do I get a good sword? Do I even need one?


So much for this now, thanks already, I'm off playing Oblivion again. Have some great days guys!

I know you're gonna go ""PC &lt;&gt; gamepad"" but I truly want to do this using my living room PC with 120"" projector while under the blanket on my couch. 

Thing is.. The menu system in this game is really awkward. It IS designed for the gamepad but it doesn't work with one. I tried everything but I still can't do keyboard only navigation on the menu.

Either drop item is missing or the map can't be scrolled with a key.

Also navigating the dialog menu and storage menus with arrow keys is a mess!!

It is awful :(

Please someone tell me how to completely navigate the menu using the gamepad.

According to this the xbox and ps3 versions have complete gamepad controls even in the menus:

Those DO NOT WORK on the PC version with buse joystick = 1. Also XPADDER still doesn't let me drop items

Is the ""mix"" of Skyrim and Morrowind worth exploring? Just wondering how similar it is to either game, and if I'd be willing to adventure into Tamriel all over again.

I would like to finish it someday but it would require so much work I'm not sure if it will ever happen (various saves have been lost, mods I made to help with its creation, etc). I'm posting here mainly just to see if anyone likes it but also to get crit on the story, structure, and overall feel of it.

I started off as a spellsword but I soon realized I didn't really like playing that character so much. So I rerolled and played a Bosmer Acrobat. I love using the bow and arrows, sneaking, thieving, lockpicking and jumping around. It was so much fun. 

The dark brotherhood quest got boring after the purification because I was wondering why I had to kill so many singular targets but my expectations just went through the roof after the encounter with Lucien Lachance and how that entire story played out. 

I loved the thieves guild too! And the reward you get at the end is amazing! I got it early in the main quest and it helped me in every quest afterwards. It's so damn useful and I'm so used to using it in game I think I can see purple spots in real life.

The only quest that was annoying for me was Allies for Bruma but once I finished it, I just felt this incredibly overwhelming sense of relief haha. The cutscene at the end of the main quest was worth everything I went though. The reward you get is utterly horrible though, I was expecting a really cool bow along with that armour.

Oh and perhaps my favourite quest line was the road to becoming the grand champion of the arena. It felt so much like Gladiator which just happens to be my favourite movie. I was able to own every combatant with my bows and arrows though.

I've played this for hours non-stop over the past week since I'm on summer holidays and it's been amazing. I still can't believe there's so much left in the map to explore. I think I'm going to keep playing my Bosmer Acrobat and level up my Blade skill so I can wield some stronger blades.

Perhaps I should reroll a new mage character and make use of all the spells I never made use of during the game! Man, the possibilities really are endless.

I had picked up Oblivion during the holidays on Steam when it was on sale (Got all the official expansions and addons.) I just got around to playing it, and I gotta say it's been a crazy ride so far.

Thanks to the community here, I was able to get a nice head start and knew a little of what was up, still kind of clueless. 

I wanted to slash stuff, so I made a Red-guard warrior, using the default signs and class template. Ever since I left that sewer, things keep going wrong. I managed to make it to the Abby to find the head guy.  Some other monk at the Abbey says ""Take a horse, it'll help."" Gleefully I run outside, grab the first horse I see, then I head off towards the red arrow.

Halfway there I run into some shrine with three followers. They ask me for a lions pelt, which I have none of, so I head back to my horse and mount up. All of a sudden, I hear ""You won't get away from us!"" as all three charge me. I assumed they wanted me dead for not having a lions pelt.

I dismount and quickly dispatch the unarmed one. I managed to knock out the quest giver dude, but this dark blue elf started beating the ever loving crap out of me with his fists. It took me a good 8 minutes to finally kill the bastard, the whole time I'm wondering what steroids he was using. Kept knocking me out and punching my body on the ground.

 I kill him and I ride off as quick as I can wondering what the hell just happened. Soon after I find another shrine, and they're all drunk bastards. I don't have the stuff they want, so I mount up again and these dudes start attacking me. Thankfully, whatever drugs the elf was using certainly weren't in use here, and I managed to kill two and knock out the quest giver. I go back to my horse, only to realize that it had the red ""You stole it"" hoof icon. If I could draw, there would be a giant troll face over that icon.

I promptly started to kill the horse to hide the evidence, but the horse too was kicking my ass. I backed up and it ran off faster than I ever rode on it, never to be seen again.

I enjoyed the fact that you could backup your stats upon completing a game and they would be useable in later games.  Does any modern game even do that?!

Some of my fav quotes in the game:  ""You delicately insert the lockpick into your left nostril.  Success!  Your nose is now open!""  

That, and ""Trespassers will be toad!""  

There were so many odd quotes, especially in QFG I.  Just look at various things (trees, rocks and such for example), use items on yourself, etc.  Sierra had a great sense of humor with the games.

As I approached it, there wasn't an enemy in sight, but there was a huge statue of some magnificent winged creature mid-flight. Pretty cool. Anyways, I went inside to take a look around, and that's when things took a turn for the worst. Before I knew it, I was surrounded by undead and powerful bandits, usually three or four at a time. In the first section of the ruins, there is a huge room where you can drop down into, but you won't be able to get back up; you can only venture onwards. So I did just that, thinking that my only hope of escape would be to continue all the way to the end where I would be rewarded with a doorway to fresh air and sunlight.

Also, regardless if they do drown or not, do they come up for air once they're underwater?

([I'm especially curious if this lesser known semi-aquatic creature drowns or not, and if it comes up for air.](http://www.reddit.com/tb/knqcr ""This link does not lead to a picture of a bear underwater.""))
****

Some unconfirmed reports I found suggesting that they  could drown:

&gt;...I'm sure I've drowned an orge at least once by a combination of damage fatigue and paralyse spells. 

&gt;It also might be worth mentioning that NPC can drown. All land creatures except those with specific water breathing qualities and liches can be drowned.  

^(From: http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion_talk:Water_Breathing)
&gt;...as far as I know, anything that's marked as being able to swim can also dive. How the game handles breathing underwater, that I don't know. It could be that anything marked as being able to swim can automatically breathe underwater, or it could be that it has some logic to encourage them to re-surface as needed, or it could even be that it'll happily let them drown if they run out of air. I know some creatures can drown, but I'm not really sure of the specifics there.  

^(From: http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion_talk:Animals#The_amazing_Diving_Bear)

Also, can creatures or NPCs that don't have the 'Water Walking' or 'Water Breathing' abilities drown?

&gt;All undead are immune to poison, and resist frost to varying degrees. Undead cannot be drowned: they all have either Water Walking or Water Breathing as a permanent ability.    

^(From: http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Undead)  
This seems to imply to that non-undead creatures or NPCs that don't have Water Walking or Water Breathing as a permanent ability, can drown.

*However*, from http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion%3aWater_Breathing :

&gt; [Water Breathing is] useless on all creatures, as all creatures seem to be able to breathe underwater naturally...

So like the post title says, I'm bored.  I stopped doing the main quest at level 10 after doing Miscarcand.  I've done almost all the other quests I can.

I don't feel like I've leveled far enough to continue the main quest.  I don't find combat compelling enough to go and close all the oblivion gates or raid all the abandoned forts and Ayleid ruins.  On the other hand, going around collecting every last nirnroot is too menial.

I could start over... maybe I should since Knights of Nine and Shivering Isles didn't install correctly (I see yellow &lt;!&gt; blocks in many places).

I love TES... these games are the pinnacle of computer RPGs.

But, the game play in Oblivion is clearly inferior to Morrowind.  Lockpicking is a nuisance (who doesn't just hammerclick the auto attempt button?).  All the simplifications they made to accommodate XBOX play left it a shell of what it could have been.  That's most of why I'm not as excited about Skyrim as I could be.

Funny story about this character (my first), my friend (who had actually introduced me to the game a few years ago) noticed that I had a crapton of saves made. I would save before making big decisions or risky maneuvers, bugs, etc, like any responsible Oblivion player, but kept making new ones, instead of keeping a single save files. He convinced me that I didn't need 50 individual saves, so, on the spot, I went through and deleted all but my most recent. Admittedly, that was a large number of saves. He also was playing a character on my xbox and so had his own save files and it did make keeping track of things difficult.

Shortly after, as he was deleted a couple of his own character's saves, he rushed a bit and deleted mine - my now-singular, cherished digital representation of over 100 hours of playtime was wiped out with the assured, confident, and eager button presses of a life-long gamer. Just after he convinced me to delete all my other saves. Life ruined for a day or so. Like a Charles Dickens novel, or perhaps listening to a Leonard Cohen album all the way through.

1323833659.0	nbx72	An Elder Scroll noob having a damage problem.  Help!	flashfx2	20	1	13	"I am a relative noob to Oblivion and for the most part having a good time.  I have a few questions that I can't seem to find an answer for anywhere else and hoping you fine redditors can help. A little background on my character.  I am an Assassin/Thief/Imperial and have been using the Oblivion XP mod.  I am level 14 and am using the Sword of the Crusader and a glass dagger.  For those not familiar with the mod you get XP for just about everything you do in the game and when you level you get 15 attribute points and 36 skill points to assign to weighted skills based off what is major and minor skills.  I'm not sure if this that is relevant or not, but thought I would mention it after reading about the leveling problem in Oblivion.

1)  My damage output seems very low, so low in fact it is really affecting how much I enjoy the game.  Some enemies I fight seem to take FOREVER to kill and I click the mouse so often it makes Diablo 2 look mouse friendly.  My blade level is 69 and strength is 68.  Some enemies like a Clannfear seem to take 40-50 swings with the dagger to kill.  I just killed a west weald brown bear and I counted 46 swings until it died.  When I do a quest where I get companions they generally all get killed off  pretty quickly, and I assume that is because I can't kill the enemies fast enough.  So basically I'm wondering is this normal?  Is my blade/strength too low, or something else entirely.

2)  After I take 40-50 whacks at an enemy with my weapon my fatigue is normally completely empty.  This of course just makes my problem of too little damage even worse.  I picked up a spell to restore fatigue and that helps to some degree, but if I am fighting a couple enemies at once it just doesn't seem like enough.  I have 228 fatigue.

3)  It is my understanding that after level 19 or so there aren't any new weapons/armor that come available.  Is this going to make my problem in #1 even worse?

Thanks!"	t5_2qs10	True

Are there other things we can store inventory in  (i.e. barrels, crates, corpses, etc.) that will be there when I get back?  

2) I managed to aggro a goblin who not only followed me out of the dungeon but chased me back to town and into a chapel.  I couldn't do anything but wait until he (fortunately) showed up.  Because of this I'm wondering if there's a console command that stops combat?  I know 'stopcombat' works but that's only if you have the target selected.  I  was stuck in everlasting combat mode without a target.

3) Does having a pickaxe make a difference when mining veins?  It seems you don't need one like you do in Skyrim.  Perhaps a pickaxe increases your chances of success or increases your rewards?

BTW:  I ran into [this creature](http://i.imgur.com/nUoRutJ.jpg) while climbing around in the Jerrall Mountains.

I have verified the install through steam repeatedly and it says it is good to go.  When I try to launch it I get a black screen for a second and then a pop up saying the program has stopped working.

So I started a new playthrough as a Lord Inquisitor who uses heavy armour, a massive hammer and anti Daedra/Necromantic powers like Turn Undead and awesome custom spells. Thus, I decided that [this mod](http://oblivion.nexusmods.com/mods/36901) would best accompany my character plan.

1354975898.0	14hxju	Why bother with stat maximizing?	Curlaub	19	3	8	"I have these friends who play Oblivion who are all into stat maximizing. As I watch them play, I have a few issues with it and I just want to know how the general community feels.

1. I think it ruins the realism. TES is really immersive, and that's great, but I think it undermines that to say, ""I can only jump this number of times because I don't want any more Dex,"" or ""I'm just gonna sit here and block this mud crab for a few hours."" I think it takes a lot of the fun out of the game.

2. It doesn't really matter. Even at mid-level, there's so many ways to break the game, like magicka/health/fatigue pots, chameleon armor, most spells, that it doesn't make a huge difference if a stat is a few points lower than it could be. The existence of the Difficulty slider alone means you should never be in a tough spot. Some people say it's cheating, but is it really any worse than taking advantage of meta stuff like stat maximizing that your character would never be aware of?"	t5_2qs10	True
1352146035.0	12onjf	What the crap happened with the elves in this game?	cocktails365	19	3	7	So, the first Elder Scrolls game I played happened to be Oblivion GOTY for PS3. I fell in the love with the series and have since downloaded Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim on Steam, as well as installed the DOS Box versions of Arena and Daggerfall. However, having played all those and then going back Oblivion, I'm curious what person on the design team had a stroke during character design. It looks like every single one of the elves went through some bizarre devolution between Morrowind and Obilivion and thanks to two centuries of selective breeding they were able to normalize themselves in time for Skyrim. Or, to put another way, it appears they fell out of the ugly tree and hit every branch down on the way. 	t5_2qs10	True

Played for about 6 hours, saved a bunch of times, and then came back home. Fired it up to play some more, and the beginning quest text for the DLC popped up again. UH-OH.

To say the least I only played a couple of hours and then left it after that cause I couldn't into it the same as with Skyrim.  Anyway, I just decided to start back in again but now I'm having problems running the game that I didn't have the first time round.  

I'm on PC and I've got a good Graphics card, NVidia GTS 450, plenty of RAM (8GB) and a Quad core Intel CPU but when I go to run the game it doesn't recognise my Video card (which I'd expect it being an old game) and defaults to 640x480 at Medium settings.  I tried the game at different resolutions, including my default at 1680x1050 but when running the game my frame rate was below 10 fps (actual at around 7 or 8) and was very lagging.

I've tried reninstalling the game and checking my video drivers but I can't think what could be causing this lag when I should be able to play the game in Ultra High like I did when I first installed 3 or 4 months ago.

I know I have enough points to raise them past 50 yet for two levels now I've been unable to get them past 49.

    Being the devoted player i am i recognized the place immediately, i regarded it as an annoyance rather than an interesting quest, contrary to my belief everyone seemed to love this particular quest, this puzzled me, after reading the most recent post on this subreddit it occurred to me that my Hackdirt experience was a little bit different then the typical one

1339372215.0	uvahk	20 hours in, still need a little more help	makesufeelgood	17	3	10	"Ok, so like the title says, I'm currently 20 hours into oblivion.  I'm having a blast; I've done several of the thieves guild quests, I murdered someone and had the Dark Brotherhood approach me, I've started like 30 quests and only completed like 5 so far.

However, I still don't understand some things and looking them up didn't clear up my confusion too much more.  So.

I really don't understand the leveling process.  I've looked at the efficient leveling post on the UESPwiki thing.  It just doesn't make sense.  I don't know why I can't/shouldn't level up my major skills to be the most efficient.  Plus, as I like to play a sneaky archer, it's freaking impossible to not level up sneak/security seeing as both of those are main skills.  Expanding on that, is it impossible to be a strong magic user as well?  Like what would happen if I decided to grind every single skill (major and minor) to 100?  Would I be equally powerful in magic, melee, and range?  Or would my major skills (which are geared toward archery) make me strongest in range attacks.

Also, let's say that I wanted to get faster.  Athletics falls under the speed attribute.  So even if I level up athletics numerous times, do I only notice a speed increase when I overall level up and level up my governing attribute of Speed?

Moving on to Alchemy, is it just a good way to make money or can you actually make useful spells?  My alchemy is like level 25 right now but everything I can make seems fairly useless except for health restoration potions.  Also I don't know if this has anything to do with alchemy but I have caught some souls...what do I do with them?

What kind of equipment is good?  Right now I'm using a dwarven longsword and a dwarven bow at level 13.  I have seen elvish weapons drop but I'm just unsure of the hierarchy of weapons.

Lastly, magic is really confusing to me.  I want to use it in conjunction with my stealth and ranged attacks but I barely have any magicka and my spells do 0 damage it feels.  It seems like regardless of my skill level increases in destruction, restoration, etc. skills, the spell always has the same amount of effectiveness.  Do I need to level up their governing attributes to see an increased effectiveness in spells?  Or do I just need to upgrade to better spells?

Anyway, I love this game so far because I've barely touched the main storyline and I've already put in 20 hours.  I'm not a huge fan of going through the oblivion portals and fighting the daedra, but I like exploring and doing some of the other questlines.  Any answers to my questions would be greatly appreciated.  I feel like not knowing the answers to these things is holding me back slightly from fully appreciating the scope of this game.

1316919026.0	kqjuf	Tips for a first-time Morrowind vet?	ginja_ninja	17	1	17	"So I installed Oblivion for the first time a few days ago. Like the title says, I have a lot of playtime logged in Morrowind, but quickly found that approaching Oblivion the same way wasn't going to work.

I basically desgined a build as an Imperial with thief birthsign, stealth spec, strength and agility favored, and major skills in blade, light armor, block, sneak, alteration, marksman, and lockpicking. I gave up on the character around level 7 or so, as I realized the enchanted items i had found don't recharge automatically like in Morrowind and I'd need to grind both my mysticism and armorer skills up to 25 to even be able to soultrap enemies for the recharge or repair enchanted items. I'd been trying to optimize my stat gains by offclassing with blunt weapons in random caves to get +5 strength per level, but even around lvl 7 and 55-60 strength it was still taking forever to kill the enemies.

So basically, I'm here asking for some ideas and strategies on how to approach the game correctly. The way I played Morrowind was as a character who could sneak well to steal things, but didn't need to for combat and could fuck shit up with light armor and an enchanted dai-katana. I never focused on any magic skills but enchanting and simply created items enchanted with all the spells I wanted to use so I could focus on my melee and stealth stats/skills.

It doesn't seem like I'm going to be able to take the same approach in Oblivion. But as for my playstyle, I want to be able to use a combination of blades and marksman, and to open up my fights with sneak attacks. It seems like magic skills are far more required here than they were in Morrowind, so I'm thinking mysticism and either alteration or destruction look promising. Any advice on effective builds and leveling strategies for this playstyle would be helpful and appreciated."	t5_2qs10	True

Just yesterday I was caught in a dilemma on what I would want to make next as a character. What I did was use random.org to help me. 

To avoid repeating myself, I made everything alphabetical. Numbers 1-10 were the races with 1 being Argonian and 10 being Redguard, for instance. Numbers 1-8, rolled twice, would be the two favored attributes. 1-13 are the birthsigns. Then 1-21, rolled seven times, would be your skills, rerolling on repeats of course. I don't know if a site like this exists to randomly generate classes(I know it does for Morrowind), but I found it a good idea so I'm not sitting at the character creator for twenty minutes pondering what to do! 

Here are two examples of what came up yesterday(I let them go as is. So if I get no weapon skills, that's too bad I roll with it).

Race: Orc;
Attribues: Luck and Speed;
Brithsign: Steed;
Skills: Mysticism, Acrobatics, Block, Heavy Armor, Conjuration, Blunt, Sneak

Race: Khajiit;
Attributes: Personality and Speed;
Birthsign: Serpent;
Skills: Alchemy, Speechcraft, Heavy Armor, Sneak, Acrobatics, Mysticism, Block

As you can see, I picked one class that has a chance at not failing(the Orc) and then a class that would probably be for shits and giggles(the Khajiit). 

Anyway, I hope this has been helpful in bringing more life back into Oblivion. It sure will for me.

I made a Wood Elf character and I'm pretty far along in my journey and I don't want to reset, but his face is just so ugly and it bothers me. I know that in the PC version you can but I am playing on Xbox so I know that isn't an option.

Seeing as I am a Wood Elf, I am an archer so I want Light Armor. Therefor I was wondering what kind of Light Armor helms there are that cover the whole face?

Thanks! :)"	t5_2qs10	True
1328823158.0	piclz	I think I've exhausted all the things to do in Oblivion, what are some of the most fun (no-quest) things to do?	Joelin8r	15	3	31	I'm pretty sure I've finished all the quests, I have the best armor/weapons ever, so dungeon spelunking is not rewarding, and I have made Rosethorn hall much better by putting miscellaneous objects around as decoration. What should I do?	t5_2qs10	True

1328233511.0	p8m0i	Is the main quest worth it?	Maramros	18	3	18	"There are lots of jokes/comments in this subreddit about ""Main quest? What?"" Or ""Who's Martin?"" etc.

I've got ~100 hours logged in Oblivion, but a lot of that is starting over with a new character due to not liking the playstyle, messing with mods, and/or losing data. So I've never gotten very far. I've just finished all the Mage's Guild Recommendation quests for the first time, and have never gotten further than the Dagon Shrine quest in the main questline.

Since I've already gotten this far, and now Oblivion gates are spawning everywhere, which makes the landscape all ugly, would there be any benefit to finishing the main quest, or should I just do components when they're near where I'm going anyway?"	t5_2qs10	True
1327232313.0	ordow	I wear the shadows well, what next?	jonpurkis	16	4	15	"I am new to Oblivion and never had any idea how good it is. I really loved that I could shy away from the usual ""kill everyone"" purpose in other games and decided to become a thief. 

But now I'm the Thieves Guild guild master and there doesn't seem to be any thieving left to do, my career is over. What path should I take next? Is there another route I can take which doesn't involve repetitive killing? When I am forced to kill someone it's particular arduous because I'm at level 8 and my character is weak and useless.

I am slightly taken by archery, is there a Thieves Guild style quest line for archers?"	t5_2qs10	True
1326641556.0	oi0nh	Dagon Shrine story of survival	expert464	16	1	7	"Went into this quest without knowing anything about what I should do. Followed the usual quest line of giving up all my equipment and going into the shrine until Mankar disappears, then stole the book as I'm supposed to and watched as 10 mythic dawn now attack me. My first attempt was just me running through the caves repeatedly casting a restore health spell looking for a way out and only finding locked doors and a conspicuous rock wall. I died on my way back to the dagon shrine as I was being hit with too many shock spells (need to work on my zig-zag strafe running!).

My second attempt I told myself that there's got to be a way out of these caves. One or two of the doors were locked so I'm thinking there must be a key laying on one of the tables or on an altar or something. So again I steal the book and run around the caves looking for stuff to help me stay alive, quickly hitting the ""activate"" key to pick up whatever is laying on shelves and tables (inkwell?! that's not going to help me!). I never found a way out though, but did manage to make my way back to the dagon shrine area where I originally stole the book. It was at this point I remembered the dagger laying on the alter. I picked up and and thought to myself ""could I actually try killing some of these people?"". After a few swipes and noticing this silver dagger is worthless, I freed the sacrifice (Jeelius) thinking he could help.. no.. selfish him just cures himself and runs towards the locked gate and then stands there waiting for me to open it for him.

Then as I'm running around I see an area that I might be able to jump to and then try casting fire spells at everyone to kill them. Problem is there's perfectly placed roots blocking all my jump attempts. I try again, nope.. roots still in the way. I drop straight down and take damage from the jump. This isn't helping me survive, I still have 5 mythic dawn running after me, casting spells and swinging maces. I'm able to keep myself alive through all of this, constantly tapping the hotkey for restore health. Try the jump again, roots still there, maybe if I crouch when I land, nope that just slows me down. It's a pretty far jump! 5th time, 6th time.. I'm noticing that these falls are making it harder to restore my health, I'm now at 60% after a heal... next time around only maxing out at 50%. But I GOT TO MAKE THIS JUMP!

At around the 12th or so try, I realize that one of the people chasing me says ""OOF"" like the sound I make when I fall from a failed jump. I turn around and look, they're dead. They have been dieing this whole time from chasing me and falling down the same put I have been. I stop and realize there's only 1 of the original 5 people left alive. I had been trying so hard to make this jump I've not been aware that everyone around me is dieing. I finish off the last person with my lousy dagger, and that's it. I've killed all 5 people in this room. Jeelius is long gone, no idea where he went. Thinking ""these dawn have got to have some nice equipment to steal""... no.. some leather boots from one of the dawn was THE BEST thing.

Put the boots on and went out the door to the next room in the cave with 3 more dawn just waiting to kill me. Lured them out one at a time to confront them only wearing a pair of boots and a dagger and managed to kill the first one. What equip did he drop? All of my original equipment. Holy moley. Quicksave right there and killed the rest of the dawn in the place and at the end found that lousy switch on the wall which removes the rock so I can escape. D'oh! Wish I would have seen that the first time through!

Still can't believe the only reason I was able to kill 4 of the 5 people in the Dagon Shrine was by slowly killing them via long falls. That was an intense 35 minutes!"	t5_2qs10	True
