1375893303.0	1jw4m6	Just started listening to The Beatles for the first time ever, just last week.	BongeSpobPareSquants	214	24	143	"I'm 28 and I've listened to rap music near exclusively my entire life. I knew about the beatles but couldn't tell you any of their songs even. 

Last week i saw some figure about their total sales and it blew me away so I started reading on wiki about them. 

Long story short The beatles have been playing almost constantly since then. I've been listening to the albums chronologically and I'm up to sgt pepper. 

 I just thought I'd share with you guys how excited I am. I don't think I've ever been infatuated with music like this before.

I've owned a guitar for several years and learned a few things but I'm completely inspired to pick it back up with this intensely rejuvenated inspiration.

It's crazy that I get to experience this in such a short time. 

Is there anything anyone could think to recommend maybe?

Like waiting x amount of time between album y and z,

I've been binge listening to them and I don't want to ruin anything hahah. Maybe that's a silly question. I'm just really stoked.

Take care all


EDIT:

 To my happy surprise I discovered that I somehow skipped over 3 entire albums after ""With the Beatles"". I don't know why I thought that. But other than being embarrassed about not being able to read properly, I'm not too bummed. 

I've listened to Please Please Me dang near 20 times it seems already, checking out the others a bit but I keep coming back. I think I'll take the advice to listen to each one for a good while from now on and really getting familiar with it before moving on.

I really am excited, so thanks again to everyone. 
I can honestly say this subreddit has the best group of people commenting I've ever seen. Is that what love of the Beatles does? "	t5_2qt7l	True

Released: March 22, 1963

**Singles:**

* Love Me Do / P.S. I Love You
* Please Please Me / Ask Me Why
* From Me to You / Thank You Girl
* She Loves You / I’ll Get You

Four smiling Liverpudlian boys look down over the stairwell inside EMI’s London headquarters in Manchester Square on the cover of their debut, Please Please Me. John Lennon (rhythm guitar), Paul McCartney (bass guitar), George Harrison (lead guitarist), and Ringo Starr (drummer) pose in matching suits below their band name: The Beatles. Little did they know their debut, impressively hitting the top of the UK album charts in the summer of 1963, would catapult the band to worldwide success.

The album consists of soul, pop, and rock n’ roll covers as well as a string of originals that introduced the world to the songwriting power of Lennon/McCartney. The album was recorded, edited, and mixed in just under 25 hours in a single studio session in February 1963. Upon its release, the album kick started a run of number one albums, a success that was awarded to eleven out of their twelve studio albums.

**Highlights:**

*  I Saw Here Standing There (Lennon/McCartney)
*  Anna (Got to Him) [Arthur Alexander]
*  Please Please Me (Lennon/McCartney)
*  Baby It’s You (The Shirelles)
*  Twist and Shout (The Top Notes)

**With the Beatles** 

Released: November 22, 1963

**Singles:**

* I Want to Hold Your Hand / This Boy

Compared to Please Please Me, this album is more explosive and fierce. It’s my favorite out of the group’s rock n’ roll era (Please Please Me, With the Beatles, A Hard Days Night). Not only are the originals part of the group’s greatest, their covers are the highlight of the album. “Till There Was You” showcases McCartney’s amazing voice, “It Won’t Be Long” is a rock n’ roll classic that sounds fresh after 50 years, and Lennon’s “Money” cover is just fantastic.

**Highlights:**

*  It Won’t Be Long
*  All My Loving
*  Don’t Bother Me
*  Till There Was You (Meredith Willson)
*  Roll Over Beethoven (Chuck Berry)
*  Money (That’s What I Want) [Barrett Strong]

**A Hard Day’s Night** 

Released: July 10, 1964

**Singles:**

* Can’t Buy Me Love / You Can’t Do That
* A Hard Day’s Night / Things We Said Today

The group appeared on their first live US television program on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964. The eruption of Beatlemania continued when the group played at Washington Coliseum and two shows at Carnegie Hall. The group was at their busiest they had been at the time, appearing in television interviews, an upcoming summer world tour, and a motion picture starring the fab four.

This album contains all original Lennon/McCartney songs. Side one works as a soundtrack for the movie of the same name, while side two lacks freshness and at times is lyrically dull (“I'm gonna love her till the cows come home”), nice one Lennon.

**Highlights:**

* If I Fell
* And I Love Her
* Can’t Buy Me Love
* Any Time at All
 
**Beatles For Sale** 

Released: December 4, 1964

**Singles:**

* I Feel Fine / She’s a Woman
* Eight Day a Week / I Don’t Want to Spoil the Party

Beatles for Sale is the group’s weakest in their catalogue - with songs such as “Mr. Moonlight”, “Honey Don’t”, and “What You’re Doing” exposes the band’s exhausted and uneven voices. Though this marked as a departure of their Merseybeat sound to a more sophisticated folk rock rhythm that lasted until the end of 1965.

However, every Beatle albums contains gold. Lennon’s song trilogy “No Reply” / “I’m a Loser”/ “Baby’s in Black” shows Lennon’s newfound influence in Bob Dylan. McCartney’s “I’ll Follow the Sun” flows like a river, and “Kansas City” is another example of The Beatles art of making covers their own.

**Highlights:**

* No Reply
* Rock and Roll Music (Chuck Berry)
* Eight Days a Week
* I Don't Want to Spoil the Party

**Help!** 

Released: August 6, 1965

**Singles:**

* Ticket to Ride / Yes it Is
* Help! / I’m Down
* Yesterday / Act Naturally

In 1965, The Beatles’ musical peers, Bob Dylan and The Rolling Stones were exploding with popularity and the group was met with a challenge of staying on top. The group began to incorporate the use of vocal overdubs and classical instruments, notably in the song “Yesterday”.
Such as in the album A Hard Day’s Night, the first side of Help! served as a soundtrack to their second motion picture and a weak side two (excluding “Yesterday”) closed the album. I would say this is the one of the Beatle albums that is lower on my list of favorites. The soundtrack songs are just catchy and the others are forgettable (in “Tell Me What You See”, Paul sounds actually bored).

**Highlights:**

* Help!

* The Night Before

* You’ve Got to Hide Your Love Away

* You’re Going to Lose That Girl

* I’ve Just Seen a Face

**Rubber Soul** 

Released: December 3, 1965

**Singles:**

* Nowhere Man / What Goes On

* We Can Work It Out / Day Tripper

This is the album the group step into maturity and complex lyrics. The character portrait of “Nowhere Man” had Lennon exploring exploring his inner thoughts , “The Word” cited the first time the band sang about abstract concepts of love rather than boy/girl teen love, and “In My Life” shines as Lennon reminisces his childhood.

It is one of my favorites! It is the first in perfect albums The Beatles would release until their breakup. Every song is beautifully crafted and shaped into perfection - the clashing of Lennon and McCartney is obvious and a pleasure to listen to. My personal favorite is “Michelle” - that bass line solo is superb.

**Highlights:**

* Drive My Car

* Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)

* Nowhere Man

* The Word

* Michelle

* Girl

* I’m Looking Through You

* In My Life

**Revolver** 

Released: August 5, 1966

**Singles:**

* Yellow Submarine / Eleanor Rigby

* Paperback Writer / Rain

The Beatles’ bubble bursts in 1966 as the loveable mop tops become the most hated band of the US southern states. In June, the US Capitol Records compilation album of Yesterday and Today caused a major backlash with its cover. The group were dressed in butcher’s overalls and covered in raw meat and decapitated plastic baby dolls. After the cover fiasco, during a tour of the Philippines, The Beatles unintentionally snubbed the nation’s first lady, Imelda Marcos.

Finally, the icing on the shit cake was topped off after Lennon made a comment in a March 1966 interview with British reporter Maureen Cleave: ""We’re more popular than Jesus now.” Religious nutjobs and the KKK were furious by Lennon’s words and “Beatle burnings” were arranged in the south.

After the shit storm, the group returned with a perfect album. Revolver was a major step into the band’s new psychedelic sound, studio experimentation, and artful songwriting - Harrison was now a major songwriting contributor. This was their peak of creativity.
“Tomorrow Never Knows” is my personal favorite - the lyrics were inspired by Timothy Leary’s The Book of the Dead. The tape loops are fun and Lennon’s vocals are beautifully weird. I also love the different genres - “Taxman”, “She Said She Said” are the rock n’ roll songs, “Love You To” is Indian, and the use of brass instruments is a first in the soul song “Got to Get You into My Life”.

**Highlights:**

* Taxman

* Eleanor Rigby

* I’m Only Sleeping

* Love You To

* And Your Bird Can Sing

* For No One

* Got to Get You Into My Life

* Tomorrow Never Knows

**Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band** 

Released: June 1, 1967

**Singles:**

* Penny Lane / Strawberry Fields

After August 29, 1966 The Beatles were free from the burden of touring and their focus was 100% in the studio.

In November 1966, the group returned to the studio with their mop tops gone and their upper lips covered in hair. This was the New Beatles. The early Pepper sessions began with their double A-side “Strawberry Fields” and “Penny Lane”. Later in January 1967, “A Day in the Life”, featuring a forty-piece orchestra, was the peak of Lennon and McCartney’s collaborative songwriting.

When the album was released, it was in the midst of the “Summer of Love” and the explosion of psychedelic artists dominating the radio - The Doors, Jimi Hendrix, Jefferson Airplane, The Grateful Dead - all of them released their debuts in 1967.

**Highlights:**

* Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds

* Getting Better

* Fixing a Hole

* She’s Leaving Home

* Within You Without You

* Lovely Rita

* A Day in the Life

**Magical Mystery Tour** 

Released: November 27, 1967

**Singles:**

* All You Need is Love / Baby You’re a Rich Man

* Hello, Goodbye / I Am the Walrus

The psychedelic fun continues in Magical Mystery Tour. While the wacky “I Am the Walrus” and the flower power anthem of “All You Need is Love” are signifiers for LSD-coated jovial times, The Beatles were mourning. The death of their manager and good friend Brian Epstein shocked the group a month before Tour was released.

Nonetheless, the group carried on and released a solid album. The song opens with a theatrical introduction similar to Pepper. “Flying” is the group’s only instrumental, with a groovy bass line, and Hello, Goodbye (while repetitive) is surprising catchy (and my first favorite Beatle song!) Side two may be better than it’s opener. Lennon’s magnum opus “Strawberry Fields Forever” is as lyrically brilliant as it is instrumentally outrageous.

**Highlights:**

* Magical Mystery Tour

* Flying

* I Am the Walrus

* Hello, Goodbye

* Strawberry Fields Forever

* Penny Lane

* All You Need is Love

**The Beatles** 

Released: November 22, 1968

**Singles:**

* Lady Madonna / The Inner Light

* Hey Jude / Revolution

After the traumatic death of the group’s manager in the fall of 1967, the group needed a distraction and a new guiding figure. They turned to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi as their guru. The band travelled to Rishikesh, India in the Maharshi's home in February 1968. The trip sparked many songs eventually included in The Beatles.

The sessions began in May and ended in mid-October 1968. During the sessions, Starr quit for two weeks, Lennon and McCartney were collaborating less, and Harrison was blossoming as a powerful songwriter. Relations grew sour with Lennon’s new romantic girlfriend Yoko Ono.

The group still prevailed and released their most innovative and compelling album yet. The Elvis-like, Beach Boys rip off “Back in the U.S.S.R.” is one McCartney still performs to this day. The mixture of loud and soft may sound uneven, but completely makes sense with the overall product. The grungy, proto-metal sounds of “Yer Blues” and “Helter Skelter” juxtapose the gentle “Julia” and “I Will” and “Revolution 9” still frightens me to this day.

**Highlights:**

* Back in the U.S.S.R.

* Dear Prudence

* While My Guitar Gently Weeps

* Happiness Is a Warm Gun

* Blackbird

* I Will

* Julia

* Yer Blues

* Mother Nature’s Son

* Sexy Sadie

* Helter Skelter

**Yellow Submarine**

Released: January 17, 1969

As a fan, I’m opposed to the idea of this album being included into the band’s core catalogue - but every reissue of the Beatle catalogue (LP, CD, 2009 remasters) include the album.

The album serves as a soundtrack to the 1968 film and not much else. It contained only four previously unreleased songs recorded during the Pepper, Tour, and early The Beatles sessions. The rest of side one are tracks off of Revolver and Tour. Side two is George Martin’s score.

**Highlights:**

* Only a Northern Song

* All Together Now

* Hey Bulldog

* Pepperland (George Martin)

**Let it Be**

Released: May 8, 1970

**Singles:** 

* Get Back / Don’t Let Me Down

For sake of keeping this in chronological order, I’m putting the band’s final album in front of Abbey Road.

Let it Be, or known as the “Get Back” sessions then, was just as hard to make as The Beatles. McCartney suggested they “record an album of new material and rehearse it” and perform it in front of an audience - live.

Director Michael Lindsay-Hogg filmed the group at Twickenham Film Studios in January 1969. The group describe the sessions as “miserable” and an aggravated Harrison walked out for five days. Harrison agreed to return only if the group relocated at Apple Studios. They agreed and the bulk of the album was finished.

While the psychedelic sounds of Pepper are fascinating but the down to basics of Let it Be is one I listen to more frequently. The folky “Two of Us” is calming as well as “Across the Universe”. The band also digs up an abandoned “One After 909” and explores their roots in “Get Back”. The title track is also one of McCartney’s greatest gifts to the world.

**Highlights:**

* Two of Us

* Dig a Pony

* Across the Universe

* I Me Mine

* Let it Be

* I’ve Got a Feeling

* One After 909

* For You Blue

* Get Back

**Abbey Road** 

Released: September 26, 1969

**Singles:**

* The Ballad of John and Yoko / Old Brown Shoe

* Something / Come Together

After a surprising phone call from McCartney to George Martin for another album, sessions began on July 2, 1969. The Beatles agreed to set aside their differences for their final product to “go out on a high note”.

The group’s harmony singing is highlighted on this album in tracks such as “Oh! Darling” and notably in “Because”. The cool groovy strut of “Come Together” is interrupted by Harrison’s love masterpiece “Something” and then intercepted by McCartney’s childish “Maxwell’s Silver Hammer”. Even Starr brings his A-game with “Octopus’s Garden”.
The album’s closing medley is a wonderful experience that beautifully ends with “The End” - a song that was the group’s goodbye to the world.

**Highlights:**

* Come Together

* Something

* Oh! Darling

* I Want You (She’s So Heavy)

* Here Comes the Sun

* The Abbey Road Medley"	t5_2qt7l	True

I would like to share my personal story of the Beatles with the r/beatles community. 
You see, when I was born, I was not expected to live. I did, however, but I did have a disease known as tracheomalacia and epiliepsy. This meant the cartilage in my body would collapse, making me unable to breathe when I lied down, along with seizures. This, as you can imagine, made life difficult, however, it was bearable, and I did survive. There was once a close call, when I was about 3 and a half. We were at our vacation house in South Carolina. I was sleeping upstairs, and my two sisters and babysitter were downstairs. You see, I had a horrible seizure, but no one was around to hear. My sister came up about a minute after, and screamed and called the ambulance. My mother came back from a walk just as she heard the ambulance. Due to my condition, the EMT told my mother that it was likely I would die. Now if you are wondering how the Beatles fit into this, just wait. When I was in the hospital, I heard a sound. Hauntingly beautiful and almost angelic. It was the Beatle's Here Comes the Sun. To this day, anytime I hear the song, I still get chills. I am now on the JV Track team. I am in 9th grade. I love the Beatles. "	t5_2qt7l	True

Reading so many stories about how people got absolutely entrenched in the beatles in the same exact way i did, made me happier then ive been in a while. Not many people i know in real life (with the exception of 2 or  3 close friends) like the beatles, so i cant really talk about them that much, but this sub makes up for that in so many ways. This is by far my favorite sub on Reddit. Thank you all so much.	t5_2qt7l	True
