We are celebrating with a DVD/Blu Ray giveaway!	atticus138	134	19	220	"First off, we want to give a ***BIG*** thank you to everyone who helped /r/Modern_Family reach 10,000 subscribers in barely over a year!! You guys are the best, there's no doubt about that! Hands down, I think this is the most friendly, easygoing community of all the TV subreddits. 

To celebrate this landmark, I'm proud to announce that one lucky subscriber can win a brand new DVD or Blu Ray set of Season 3. **All you have to do is enter the contest!**

---

Here are the details:

**How do I enter?**

- Simply leave a comment in this thread telling us you are entering.

**When does the sign-up start/end?**

- ~~Sign-up begins *right now* and will be open for one week. It will close next Friday (March 22) at 5:00 pm *CENTRAL TIME.*~~

The sign-up has closed.

**How will the winner be decided?**

- I am literally going to drop individual pieces of paper with every contestant's name into a hat (well, probably a bowl or something in my kitchen) and draw one out.

**If I win how do I get my DVD/Blu ray?**

- You can give me your shipping info via PM and I will purchase the set from Amazon.com myself and it will be shipped directly to the mailing address you provide. 

---

So there we have it. Clear as mud? 

Again, thank you all so much for a great first year and GOOD LUCK! :D

I assume it's already clear to most viewers that Haley and Luke are designed to be representations of Claire and Phil at their respective ages. Luke does mediocre in school but stumbles on momentary lapses of greatness which keep him above water, and Haley is the typical popular girl who gets drunk at parties and comes home after curfew. These similarities between the two parents/kids and were explored a number of times throughout the first three seasons, but now with Haley out of the house and Luke reduced to one-liners that no kid his age would be able to come up with in a million years, where does that leave Alex? 

Well, to me this is where it gets good because it shows the writers dedication to character development, and how well thought out every piece of the show has to be in order to be so consistently funny as they have been these past 3 years. Alex represents the best qualities taken from both parents; fiercely competitive and ultra-achiever like Claire, but still down to earth, funny, and sarcastic like Phil. She absorbed the most extreme qualities from each side of the family, and because of this has become the most moderate voice and consistently balanced character on the show. 

Showrunners and head writers have a great habit of writing themselves into certain characters or using them for speeches they feel like they need to get off their chest. Larry David and George Castanza, Bill Lawrence and Dr. Cox, Dan Harmon and Abed Nadir, these are all characters which had their own quirks and indifferences, but almost always they came from a place that was somewhere near and dear to the creator of the show's heart. Hopefully Steven Levitan recognizes an open hole when he sees it, and a few years down the line we can look forward to yet another one Alex's snarky, yet sensible takes on the way Families conduct themselves today in Modern society. 

While they haven't given her all the greatest storylines to work with up until this point, considering Haley's departure she could become a much heavier star than she has in years past. The wisdom of Jay, the tenacity of Claire, and the sheer dumb-luck of Phil should be all she needs to take her character from the side to the spotlight in no time, and I'm excited to see what that means both for the show, and the message it portrays in the next few seasons to come. 

tl;dr- Alex is the only character who has the sincere capacity for sarcasm, and I feel like that quality could become much more important if the show wants to survive the next couple years"	t5_2ta16	True

It's such a sweet show. 

I just finished the season 2 finale, and I loved it. My favorite part had to be when Phil yelled ""I got Claire!"" I love how this show can make me genuinely smile from both humor and straight happiness. I look forward to season 3!"	t5_2ta16	True

- Great stuff with Jay and Lily!!

- The ""Fire and Ice"" style hospital scene seemed to put a different spin on things.

I'm trying to find a specific episode, but I'm having trouble based on looking at the descriptions alone.  Figured one of you may be able to help.

The episode in question contained a subplot in which Mitchell makes a number of statements that make him seem like a repressed gay person and he keeps catching himself.  I remember it repeated through the episode and I believe it was in the fourth season.  

The episode may have ended with a scene in a restaurant in which Mitchell and Cam leave after saying things that are misinterpreted, but I may be confusing two episodes with that last piece.

- Phil's kid-like excitement for Disneyland was great. Sucks that he was sick, but his staggered running was pretty funny.

- Mitch and Cam talking to the twin's mom about their kids was another funny moment. ""They're a bit feisty today"" and ""She's friendly""... also when they took off her leash and she darted for Chip and Dale was great: ""She's chasing squirrels now.""

- (Kinda going out of order here) Jay and Gloria's jacket/shoe discussion at home made me chuckle.

- I'm kind of a sucker for Alex, so when she went head over heels for Ethan, I was feeling a little protective, I'm not gonna lie.

- Classic Manny

- I'm curious to see where they're going with the return of Dylan.

- Of course it was great to see the return of Kevin Hart as Phil's friend Andre. I really wish we could have seen more of him this season. 

- Two of my favorite lines came from Alex. When Phil pulled up with his new convertible, Alex says *""I don't like this.  My friends dad brought home a car like this. Now he lives in a studio apartment and dates a girl who works at Forever 21... which she won't be for two more years.""* ... in the same scene, Haley came charging out of the house, thinking the car was for her and Alex's next line was *""Can I please tell her? I ask for so little.""*

- Mitchell and Cam talking about their trip to Chinatown was pretty funny. *""Also, China is not Vietnam.""*

- Gloria: ""I'm not getting in the tiny plane or the *ticka-ticka-ticka!*""

- It was good to see Claire cut loose and enjoy herself for the day.

I understand that the kids need to grow up, but what is with bumping him up by about 3 years all at once?  And suddenly making him older than Manny?

At work we are currently doing something like a secret santa type thing that lasts a week.  Each employee that participates fills out a form listing different things they like or enjoying doing, etc and this gets given to someone who then secretly provides gifts related to their interests or just gifts of time.

Long story short... the person I got listed 'Modern Family' as their favourite show.  Having never watched it, I was hoping that I might get some suggestions for things I could do.  Even if it is more memorable quotes or references that I could include in a card or drawing or something.

Any help greatly appreciated.

1353659797.0	13nsin	What was up with Sarah Hyland being absent from this past week's episode? [SPOILERS]	miranders	14	3	4	"Is or was Sarah Hyland working on some other film or television project while filming for Season 4 was going on? 

I thought they were putting Haley 'on the bus' for sure at the end of Episode 2 (""Schooled""), but then I was a bit surprised when she continued making brief appearances via webcam chat. I really didn't think they were going to be able to keep that fresh or funny for much longer, but also feared they might try to incorporate Haley's life at college as sort of a fourth ""family"" the audience keeps up with. Not cool.

Then five episodes later, BAM, she gets kicked out of college and is back in the Dunphy house.... so problem solved, I guess? However, I noticed that she was completely absent from the episode immediately after that! No mention of her or explanation as to where she is while Phil has the house all to himself and Claire is out of town with Alex and Luke in tow.

I know that on shows with large enough ensemble casts, sometimes an actor or two may be missing from a few episodes for various reasons (a good example being Ariel Winter, who is missing from a few MF episodes here and there due to child labour laws or something of the like), but this just seems odd considering they had just based a whole episode on Haley's dismissal from college and return to the Dunphy household... RIGHT before this one aired!

Could it be that the episodes were aired in the wrong order and this is a continuity issue of some sort? It seems like the events in this past week's episode took place BEFORE Haley moved back in..."	t5_2ta16	True
