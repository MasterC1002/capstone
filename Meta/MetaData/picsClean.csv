I would greatly appreciate anyone who could be of assistance.

http://imgur.com/2g4HO


PS  Hug your mom today

Edit: Thanks for all the well wishes.  This has been a hard year losing both my dad and mom to cancer.  The funeral is in a few days and I will be displaying this picture on a collage  - the last one taken of her by anyone.

Reddit is a wonderful place.

Edit2: After many sleepless night s I took a sleeping pill last night only to awake to so much outpouring of love and concern.  Thanks for all the many excellent photoshops.  I know this is something that is worth of money, but I would like to give deep thanks from a devastated family.  I hope to thank you all more personally in the future.

Edit3: My family is so touched.  When I posted I expected a few replies but for over a thousand people to help with the photo, offer condolences, or say how beautiful mom's smile was is overwhelming.  I wish I could take the time to thank each person individually but cannot so I will say it here.  Thank you.  This was a picture from my 40th birthday right before things got bad.  She has so happy.  She was a wonderful mother and a wonderful person.  I have always visited Reddit, but will now consider it home. "	t5_2qh0u	True
