He was my best friend. he was 16 years old when he finally gave up. yesterday my dad called me and told me about a disabled older man he knows that has a pure chocolate lab female that he breeds and gives away the pups. he does not sell his puppys. he just loves the breed and wants to see it flourish. 

so today my dad is bringing me the last puppy this man has. it is just weened. it is eating puppy chow that is softened. the dog is female and i have already decided on the name Maggie. i can not wait til i get off work today so i can go home and meet my new friend!!!

i will post pictures of her as soon as i can."	t5_2taso	True

Tonight she finally broke through that wall in the name of getting her stick. Of course, because I'm a dumbass, I didn't actually get pictures of her fully swimming, but trust me, she did and it was very exciting. This was also her first time off-leash. I was nervous, but she was completely well behaved. It was a big day for us. 

Irrelevant sidenote: It was such a beautiful, clear day here in WA, that you can see Mt. Ranier, which is 200 miles south of us, off in the distance.
