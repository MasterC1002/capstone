1366919148.0	1d3qqc	My correspondence with Suburban Express's Lawyer	NegatedVoid	960	146	392	"
**Update: [no lawsuit](http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/1d6g7i/suburban_expresss_lawyer_no_lawsuit/)**


Got this letter in the mail today. Sorry for the crappy cell phone picture, I'll reproduce the majority of it in my response below.

[Here is a link to the letter i received](http://imgur.com/a/OYasT).

Dear Mr. Long,

First, please be advised that my e-mail address is Murph@murph.cc. You
have it wrong.

Below, I respond to each point of your email in detail. Be advised
that I'm quickly retyping your words as I go, and thus and omissions
or typographical errors are a mistake. Please supply me with a proper
electronic copy of further correspondence.

&gt; It is my client's understanding that you are the moderator of this
  thread

I am one of several moderators, and many reddit admins who have the
ability to interact with the postings on /r/uiuc.

&gt; and not only are you personally publishing false and libelous
  information

I don't believe I am, it'd be helpful if you could respond with the
specifics on this accusation. I don't intend to be libelous.

&gt; but you are also allowing false and libelous posting about my
  client's business operations despite clear knowledge on your part
  that the materials are untruthful.

I have no 'clear knowledge' that anything posted is libelous, and as
far as i know, I am under no legal obligation to prevent these
postings. If you wish to have those postings modified, please address
your letters to Reddit, not myself. I believe strongly in allowing
people to post their opinions and try to only remove content if it is
violating the community guidelines.

&gt; It is my understanding that you have no personal experience to form
  as a basis to make the assertions that you have published, because
  you have never been a customer of Suburban Express with a negative
  experience.

This is false. I've had personal negative experiences with Suburban
Expresss, both as a customer and not.

&gt; It is my understanding that whenever anyone attempts to post
  something that either defends or makes positive reference to
  Suburban Express, you take the extraordinary step of removing that
  information.

Actually, there are many positive postings that have not been
removed. I have even used my moderation ability to whitelist positive
postings by frequent members of the community. I have only removed
postings that were either spam (Such as someone creating multiple
accounts), violating the community guidelines (Posting personal
information, harassing, etc), or otherwise unsuitable for the content
of the subreddit, /r/uiuc. I do not claim to be perfect, though, and
determining which posts are made by legitimate users is not something
I can do with 100% accuracy.

&gt; This exercise of control over the reddit postings by you are clearly
  done for no other purpose than to harm the business interest of my
  client.

The primary goal of my posting and action is to further the discussion
and community of /r/uiuc. I also aim to prevent the many readers and
students who get their information from /r/uiuc from being targeted by
lawsuits. 

&gt; You further claim to know that some and/or all of the posts which
  are negative about Suburban Express are being made by someone at
  Suburban Express, however, I doubt that you have any actual proof of
  your thoughts.

I will assume that you meant 'postive' instead of 'negative' since
surely SubEx wouldn't be insulting itself.

I don't have any proof. However, I have a strong personal belief and
many of the users agree with me. There probably is such proof,
however, which would only come to light if this proceeds to litigation
- a counter-claim of harassment would reveal the IP logs during
discovery. You can ask your client if that would be a good thing, or a
bad thing, for him.

&gt; The fact that you are taking these actions to remove anything which
  might counterbalance the negativity expressed against Suburban
  Express evidences your intent to maintain this reddit thread to
  interfere with and harm the business interests of Suburban Express.

As discussed, that is not what I'm doing. So no, It doesn't. That is
not my intent.

&gt; My client also takes issue with a heading on your thread where you
  inform people ""don't ride Suburban Express! They are likely to sue
  you, have terrible reviews, and also this"". Based upon the ridership
  of Suburban Express though this year and the year of 2012, the
  percentage of customers who are sued for violating the terms and
  conditions is so minuscule as to make your claims about being sued
  false, and this fact is also true relative to your claim about
  terrible reviews.

Peoria Charter has sued none of it's passengers. I don't know of any
other local bus company that has. Over a hundred lawsuits,
comparatively, is thus very likely.

If you're trying to argue that 1.5/5 stars is not ""terrible reviews""
than you need to visit internet review sites more often. That is
clearly bad.

I stand by these claims, and they will remain up until I see a serious
change in the behavior of your client and receive a public apology for
his actions.

&gt; Accordingly, if you do not take corrective action to remedy the
  damages from your false and libelous postings by removing the items
  at issue by April 27, 2013, Suburban Express has authorized the
  pursuit of legal actions against you as a result of your conduct.

Again, I'm not sure exactly which 'postings' you consider
libelous. Please be specific in the future so we can discuss the
individual assertions within them.

As far as I can see, your client has no legal ground to stand on, is
probably guilty of harassment, and should be ashamed of his actions.

I welcome your response. I'd also encourage you to make an account on
Reddit if you do not already have one, and to visit the UIUC
subreddit. You could even do a ""AMA"" style posting (short for Ask Me
Anything) - I'm sure many of our community members would love to ask
questions about what it's like to be a lawyer and what it's like to
represent Suburban Express.

Valediction,

 --Murph

 #8 in Relative Growth  
&gt;We originally stated that there would be prizes for the top absolute growth, top relative growth, and admin's choice. We've decided to increase that to 7 winners:
Rochester Institute of Technology - The biggest and most active subreddit at the start of the competition, still the biggest and most active. Great job!
University of Waterloo - The biggest and best growing non-US subreddit.
University of California, Los Angeles - Crazy subscriber growth over the final weeks of the contest. How did they do it?
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute - Among the top 20 largest subreddits despite having only 5,394 undergrads.
University of California, Berkeley - Great hustle making in becoming the 2nd biggest college subreddit. 
University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign - Very active subreddit.
Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University - Satisfyingly long school name and also had some pretty decent growth.
Lots of engineering schools. Where are all the Liberal Arts students?

&gt;The winning schools will each get a box of goodies (shirts, stickers, surprises?) and we will change the frontpage style to reflect the school's logo for a day. Also depending on our availability we will try to organize some meetups/parties at the winning schools.

&gt;Great job everyone, now go study.

Hurray, free stuff!

On the ride home, I lost my purse. It had my wallet inside. It had my phone inside. It had my thyroid medication inside. It had my contraception inside (uncomfortable to mention, but I mention this so we can acknowledge that this had very important and temperamental medication involved). It had my iCard, my license, all of my money, my debit card (connected to all the money I'd made hostessing at a restaurant after school), amongst other things. Needless to say, for a freshman barely with her foot in the door, it was a stressful event to occur mid-semester. 

I submitted a lost item report to Suburban Express online, as indicated.  In my rush of anxiety at loosing all of my things, I also called Suburban Express. I wish I hadn't called, maybe I would have gotten my stuff back.

I called, and someone picked up. The conversation was brief yet left a deep impression on me. 

I detailed, breathlessly and nearly in tears, that I had lost a very important bag. Whoever I was talking to said, and I quote because I can still remember this...

""If it was so important, why did you lose it?""

I was silent for a moment, then not even outraged, just astonished at this diatribe.  

After that disastrous call, I did not hear anything from Suburban Express until MAY 13 when I received an email saying Suburban Express had located my item. Since I was already back home, I tried to arrange a shipping label. However, before I paid for a shipping label, I wanted to see a picture of what they found (I didn't want to pay to ship something that might not be mine). After I sent an email requesting details about the item, which for me means something as simple as a quick photo, I never got a response.

The email Suburban Express sent to me indicated I could pick up my purse from their 714 S Sixth Street office. On a trip to visit a friend in CU for the summer I stopped into their office, JUNE 20. 

When I arrived, I saw they were renovating so I called the office. Whoever answered my call was surprised when I told him I was standing outside the S Sixth Street office. He did let me in. 

Whoever he was, he was odd. He seemed distinctly ill-at-ease. He was a late middle-aged man who was pretty nondescript. After telling him my story, trying to emphasize that finding my purse would mean a lot to me, he riffled through a small box. He then told me (with the posture and voice of one who is lying or caught mid wrongdoing) that some of the lost and found had been moved to the Lisle Office. After that, he sort of tried to shoo me out but, flustered and not suspicious of foul-play,  I stopped him and left him my contact information (my name and email). 

I never heard from them again until JUNE 25, 5 days after my visit to the office.

I received a message from Suburban Express, from an email ""themooseoutfront"" to which I cannot email back saying, ""Please note that your lost item has been disposed of as it was on hand for more than 90 days.""

I don't know what happened to my purse. I don't know what is wrong with this company. If they located it on May 13, and it is only June 25 then they did not keep it for 90 days. Also, I followed their instructions to retrieve my bag. I tried on June 20, in person. 

I sent an email explaining this entire situation and they never responded. It has been multiple business days since I sent my email.

For those who wanted photos, I apologize for the quality.There are 2 images, click next on the top left to see both.

Basically, we have information that potential customers of Suburban Express would like to hear. As long as it is all absolutely factual, we should be legally safe in spreading this information.

So, /r/uiuc, let's brainstorm some legal, reasonable things that we can do, and then implement something small but effective.

I never went in there before but had to go in and get a lab manual. While in there, I was amazed at the abundant amount of electronic devices they have there at dirt cheap prices. For example, the guy in front of me in line bought an iPod cable for $1.30. I bought a 4 pack of AAA Energizer batteries for about $1.40. Comparatively, Walgreens, TIS, and other stores were charging about $7 for 4 AAAs. They also have a ton of cool things that I wanted to buy and I'm sure they were cheap too: keyboards, mice, headphones, usbs. Call ahead if you're looking for something specific obviously. They also have circuit parts but I'm sure if you needed circuit parts then you already knew that.

Basically, I never saw it pushed here before, but the ECE store is where I'll be going for all my future electronic needs. "	t5_2qkxs	True

1330619653.0	qd2gq	Know your Fourth Amendment for this weekend!	whackedspinach	122	20	73	"After hearing about several of my friends' encounters with law enforcement, I realized that many students here do not know what the fourth amendment is or how to apply it.  I figured you might need to use it this weekend, so I've written a nifty little walk through here on how to stay search-free!


**The point of this post is to educate you on how to protect yourself against law enforcement.  If you have an emergency, please do call the police.  Safety should come first.**


**-- What is the Fourth Amendment? --**


The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects you from unreasonable searches and seizures from the US government.  The actual text is:


""The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.""


I had to memorize this in high school (and I can still recite it!), but the important parts are ""secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects"" and  ""no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause"".


That first statement says that police cannot search you, your residence, your papers (usually ID), or effects.  The courts usually hold a persons residence to the highest standard of privacy, and so that is the most protected by the amendment.  If an officer stops you, the only thing you are required to tell them is your name and address.  **You do not have to show ID!**.


The second statement states that a police officer must have ""probable cause"".  The courts deem probable cause to be that which a ""a reasonable belief that a person has committed a crime"", where reasonable is defined as that which the average man may deem sufficient.  Note that this requires much more than suspicion, and just because an officer may think something illegal may be going on, they do not have probable cause.


**-- Exceptions to the Fourth Amendment --**


There are, of course, several exceptions to note.  I won't talk about all of them (like border searches), but I will go over the relevant ones for parties, etc.


* Consent: The major exception is consent.  Your Fourth Amendment right can be given up at any moment, and it is up to you to keep it.  **If a law enforcement officer mentions anything about wanting to search you, your vehicle, or your residence, reply with ""I do not consent to any searches"".** That is an unambiguous and firm answer.
**You should also know that if you did give away consent at any point, either verbally or in your housing contract, you can reassert it at any moment.**

* Plain View Doctrine: Anything that can be considered ""in plain sight"" by a law enforcement officer, even if it is through a window or through an open door, is not covered by the Fourth Amendment.  This also applies to smells, by the way.  Take note, ents.  **Therefore, you should not open your door or windows without first making sure that no one is behind you and there is no evidence of alcohol in sight.  Close and lock your door behind you when you step outside.**


* Exigent Circumstances: This exception covers all emergencies where an officer thinks that someone or their property is in danger.  It also covers cases where getting a warrant would take too long and the evidence is about to be destroyed.  **This, in conjunction with the plain view doctrine, gives an officer the right to search you without a warrant if they have probable cause to get a warrant.** 


* Incident to Lawful Arrest: **If you are arrested, the police can legally search you and usually your vehicle.**


**-- How to Deal with Law Enforcement --**


**Above all, never give consent to a search.**


First off, you should always comply with the physical directions of the police officer, such as ""stand here"" or ""show me your hands"".  There is no need to give them cause to suspect they are in danger of bodily harm.  Don't be a dick to the officers, you will be less likely to get in trouble if you aren't swearing at them.


Secondly, **do not say anything more than you need to**.  The  Fifth Amendment gives you protection against incriminating yourself, and staying silent does not give a police officer probable cause to get a warrant or perform a search.  Lying to an officer, on the other hand, does allow the to charge you with Obstruction of Justice.


Third, make sure you never give an officer probable cause for a warrant.  **Keep any illegal activity, such as drunken guests or alcohol containers out of sight.**  An officer who thinks that a guest is underage and drinking may have probable cause to search them.


Finally, never make deals with a police officer.  They may offer to ""let you off easy"" if they can ""just take a look around"".  **Police officers have no control over your sentence and cannot authorize any sort of deals.  Do not bargain with them.**


**EDIT: The four sentences you should need when talking to police:**

* ""I do not consent to any searches.""
* ""Am I being detained?""
* ""Am I free to go?""
* ""What is your name and badge number?""

The only other thing you have to say in Illinois is your name and address (although whether you actually have to give these is iffy).  Beyond that, stay silent.

I assumed the e-mail address was wrong or something. He responded and answered all my questions 15 minutes after I called to complain. Fuck these guys and their morally bankrupt, monopolistic business.

Hey everyone, after some exceptionally shitty service, I'm obligated to remind anyone looking for apartments that you should avoid living with Campus Property Management if possible. A few examples of things they do:

-Frequently barge into your apartment. They will knock, and if you don't answer, they will come in, regardless of what you may be doing and regardless of if you yell ""please go away, this is a bad time!"" or not. Their way around this is taping a ""viewing schedule"" to your door that lists viewing hours every day as 10am-10pm. This is, like most things, not mentioned in the lease.

-The apartments are not kept up. When I moved in, my dresser was on the balcony and there was a plank of wood with nails through it sitting out there, for some unknown reason. Despite their fixation on having carpets shampooed, ours clearly had not, since you couldn't walk on it without shit sticking to your feet. There were dirtmarks on the wall, little holes burned in our carpet, tons of mysterious black goop on the bathroom floor, a window with several 3-foot cracks in it, and hair EVERYWHERE. It took about a week to get the apartment livable.

-The furniture and appliances are all broken. Most of our chairs and tables had broken (if wood) or bent (if metal) legs on them. The appliances were all 30+ years old and barely worked, and the air conditioner has never been serviced in its 10-20 years of age. Our toilet flushing handle was broken upon move-in and our sink was clogged, there were holes in all the walls and random nails sticking out, the power randomly goes out in our bathroom frequently, and the lack of service on air conditioners caused a water clog that flooded the parking garage and caused a 4 foot hole in the ceiling, which would have caused tons of damage to any car that would have been parked under it at the time.

-They will royally screw you on your lease payments. My current lease ends a full 16 days before the day it started last August, but you still need to pay a full month's rent for that. When I complained about this, the woman at CPM kindly informed me that they don't appreciate being called scammers who don't deliver what they advertise, however true it may be, and that my attitude would have an impact on how much of my security deposit is returned. 

Yes, you read that right. Complaining about shitty conditions means that they will steal your money, just because they don't like you.

Take my advice, and never stay with CPM. Tell all your friends, don't stay with CPM. It's one thing to read about having an awful landlord, and it's another thing entirely to have to actually live it. "	t5_2qkxs	True

I want to thank the kind gentleman who gave me his [umbrella](http://i.imgur.com/IUuux2I.jpg) on June 21st. I was waiting at a bus stop in front of an Aldi in Urbana, IL. I was carrying a heavy backpack and a tote filled with groceries when I was suddenly caught in a downpour. The gentleman stopped by the side of the road and he stuck his umbrella through his car window. At first, I refused to take his umbrella, but after a good few seconds of him insisting that I take it, I gave in. As he passed me his umbrella, he even said thank you. 

This has been the nicest and most unexpected thing that a stranger has ever done for me. He not only made the rain go away but also rescued the ice cream that I just bought from melting. I will never forget his kindness.

I would like to treat him to some Cold Stone ice cream and return his umbrella so that he can keep on doing what he does best, helping out a stranger in need."	t5_2qkxs	True

Now that was kind of a dick move on their part, I admit. However, it has been about a week now, and you[ haven't done anything about it](http://i.imgur.com/7W8Z7.jpg). And as you can see by the picture, it looks fucking disgusting; you can smell it from a block away now.

Seriously, do you guys just not care about how your house looks? not even a little bit? not even enough for two of your guys to spend 10 minutes out there with a shovel and garbage bag? Because how long it would take to get rid of the problem, maybe 15 minutes if you include hosing it off a little.

You guys disgust me. Its shit like this that makes you and all of greek life look terrible, when going greek can be so much better. It says a lot about your fraternity, it tells everyone around that none of you care enough about your house to put any work into making it better. That's the sign of a dying fraternity, and it saddens me that none of you care about such a major part of your life right now.

Sincerely,

Someone from another frat who gives a shit about their house.

*p.s. It takes about a week for maggots and flies to hatch in ideal conditions; given this weather they should be popping up anytime now.

Ask if anyone wants to take the bus to green street and get some Qdoba. There are tons of people taking ECE110, PHYS211, PSYCH100, ECON101, CHEM102 on your floor. Get everyone's schedules and see if you can organize a study group. Go talk to your RA. Get to know him/her. 

Do you drink? Find out who on your floor brought some alcohol. Do you not drink? Man up and have a beer (but don't go overboard). Do you not drink for religious or health reasons? Don't drink, but go find a party tonight. You don't need alcohol to act a fool and have a raging good time (although it certainly helps).

Quad Day is coming up. I want you to join every club that even remotely interests you. And then join one or two clubs that you have no interest in. Note: ""October Lover's"" and ""Harassing Illini"" are *mandatory* clubs.

Look. College can be intimidating. College can be scary. But college can be anything you want it to be. So much happens at the very beginning and you are so stimulated and so confused and the food at PAR still tastes amazing and the classes are so huge and there are so many good looking people and there are more fraternities than you can possible hope to remember. Do you know what that feeling you've had since you've come here? The anticipation, the excitement, the anxiety, the fear, all rolled up in one? That's the feeling of leaving your comfort zone. Some people like that feeling, and some people don't. Some people want it to stop. They go back into their comfort zone: video games, reddit, late nights and meals alone. That's you. And you need to stop.

Look, I love reddit. That's why I'm here, and it's great... in moderation. I do love reddit. But I love U of I more. I know that in the beginning of your college life new experiences, emotions, and stimuli are *forced* upon you. You don't have a choice with that. But what you do have a choice with is how you react. 

**TL;DR** - You can stay in your safe little internet bubble and feel good for the moment. Or you can jump straight into the deep end of the pool. 

Just jump.

As he came closer, he put out his arms as if to hug me, at which point I noticed his bare chest and rippling abs were dripping with honey. He was still stinging. 

""Is that honey?"" I asked
""Yup, that's honey"" he said. He then bounded away, picked up a eight-foot long, orange-and-blue cardboard cutout of a guitar off the ground, and began to shred the guitar solo while gyrating. 

He was...magnificent.

He was holding a newspaper that was moving and i saw out of the corner of my eye that his zipper was down and his hand was in that area... he was totally masturbating in public! I told an employee and when the employee came to check it out, the guy saw him and got up and left quickly and took off running down the street.  It was super weird, but yeah if you see an older guy in the union jackin it, tell the employees and say that he got spooked last time.  The police came and now have it on record.  	t5_2qkxs	True

I'm going to try to gather some information about who you'll see on your ballot and then I'll try to gather some information about them. It'll be based on my address (Urbana), but I *welcome contributed info* about all the candidates.

## Please don't just vote down the party lines. If you think that it matters if the Auditor or Recorder of Deeds belongs to a certain party, you're wrong.

Please contribute any interesting / useful / factual information you've got on these candidates. I'll do my best for fair-and-equal coverage.

**President / Vice President.**

 Hopefully, you already know who Obama and Romney are. Gary Johnson (Libertarian) and Jill Stein (Green) will also be on the ballot.

Howie Hawkins is listed as the Green Party vice presidential candidate. This is because the state required their party to to submit a candidate prior to the party’s actual nomination. No worries - vote for Jill and Howie and your vote will still go to Jill and Cheri.

UDJ is a social music player. It allows a group of people to add songs to a single playlist, and also vote on other people's song choices. It works like this: You download the UDJ player and start it up on your computer. The UDJ player can sync with your iTunes library or you can manually select music to include in your UDJ library. Now, all your friends can download the UDJ app on their smartphones and interact with your player. They can add songs from your library, and also vote songs up and down. The playlist then puts the most popular songs at the front of the queue, and pushes unpopular songs to the back.

Our website is [www.udjplayer.com](https://www.udjplayer.com/). There you can download the UDJ player for Mac, Windows, or Linux, and there are also links to the mobile app store pages. We have apps for Android, iPhone and Windows phone and are currently working on a web app as well. We don't want anyone to be left out.

We hope that we've solved the problem of people drunkenly taking the iPod hostage at parties by letting everyone have a say in what music is played. We're very happy with our work and are ready to share it with UIUC and the rest of the world. Feedback is always welcome, and if you're interested in joining the team we are always looking for more help. At this stage we mainly need people who can code. Everything is open source and up on Github if you want to take a look.

TheDoubleOnTundra	81	10	69	"There's so many cool things that you'd have to pay for in the real world that you don't have to here at UIUC. I'm thinking of creating a list of these things. I will edit this list repeatedly as I (and hopefully, all of you) come up with things.

Here's the list, I'll start with some simple ones and think of some off the top of my head.


**The ARC and CRCE!** Never again in our lives will we have the opportunity to pay nothing for unlimited access to a gym at our peak physical condition. Climbing is $2 at the ARC; in my hometown the same access would require $19. [EDIT yes I know we pay for this stuff with our student fees/tuition, but my point is that we pay for this so we might as well use it.]

**Discounted shows at the Krannert Center.** Cheap tickets, quality entertainment.

The **Krannert Art Museum** is free. You should at least go once.

**Free transportation!** The MTD goes just about everywhere you need to go on an everyday basis, and you don't have to pay for gas money.

**Access to academic journals.** Though you probably won't need them that much after graduation, it's great to get free scholarly info that others have to shell out a few hundred bucks for.

**Cold packs, condoms/birth control, health advice, and practically everything at McKinley.** You might not need them that often, but they come up in the clutch when you need them to.

**[The FabLab!](http://cucfablab.org/)** It's a little-known place, but you should check them out. I discovered them via reddit. You get to make cool 3d shit.

**Writing helpers** come in handy when you just whipped up an essay and need to see if it's total shit or not. They know their stuff.

There are many **free sports games** out there. Out of all of the free events, I've only been to baseball games, but surely there are more. Also, Illini Hockey is exciting and relatively cheap, at $6 per student ticket.

**Free newspapers.** The NYT, Chicago Tribune, USA Today, as well as the Daily Illini and News-Gazette are free in various dorms and public campus locations. I get mine at PAR, but surely they are lying around the Union, UGL, etc.

**Free food on the first week, and free stuff on Quad Day.** There are also ""Lunch On Us"" programs in the cultural houses.

**[Free motorcycle lessons!](http://www.mrp.uiuc.edu/)**

**[The UIUC Webstore](http://webstore.illinois.edu/home/)** offers discounted software for a good chunk off retail prices. Some stuff is free too.

The **[Meat Sciences Lab](http://events.ansci.illinois.edu/meat_sales/)** near PAR offers meat for discount prices.

You can access **Lynda.com**, a software training website, [for free through CITES](http://www.cites.illinois.edu/training/lyndatutorials.html).

**Discounted electronics in the Everitt basement.**


And from cafarelli....
&gt; I can't believe no one else has said something like ""unlimited use of the 4th largest library in the nation!""
You have access to one of the greatest Interlibrary Loan Departments also. You want a book you can't find in our catalog or on I-Share? Those BAMFs can get it to you in about 2 weeks. FOR FREE.
Articles you can't get access to, aren't online yet or we don't have a hard copy of? A link to a PDF right in your goddamned inbox in about a week.
You pay a couple hundred for your library fee each tuition cycle, use your library for something besides a quite place to study. Unless you're going on to be Faculty at Yale or Harvard you will never have access to better scholarship resources.

*I write today to inform you that University of Illinois President Michael J. Hogan has tendered his resignation, and I have accepted it on behalf of the Board of Trustees. President Hogan will remain with the University as President through a transition period until July 1.* 

*President Hogan joined the University at a very challenging time, when it had just weathered a long and very public controversy around admissions and enrollment practices, had major gaps in the administrative team, and was under such significant financial constraint that furloughs and salary freezes were required. The Board sought out a reform-minded leader and was glad to find Mike Hogan, a veteran and accomplished educational leader with a distinguished record, who was committed to carrying out an exhaustive mandate of change with a sense of necessary urgency. We were not the only university pursuing him. Ultimately, he chose to lead the University of Illinois because of its reputation and his belief that he could make a difference.*

*In his nearly two years as President, Mike accomplished a great deal, and the University owes him a debt of gratitude for moving a number of tough initiatives forward. Among the achievements:  the University netted more than $30 million in recurring annual savings through major administrative efficiencies that have been reallocated to support academic and research programs, offsetting declines in state funding and late payments from the state. He has successfully recruited a highly talented leadership team and implemented the first merit-based salary increase in three years. There have been no furlough days on his watch. During his tenure, state appropriations have remained essentially level, notwithstanding the state budget crisis.*

*It has not been easy. Some of what Mike Hogan was compelled to do was not popular, but he did what this University needed over the past 20 months, and we thank him for his hard work, perseverance, and achievement.* 

*The Board feels that the most appropriate next step in university leadership should come from a proven administrator with a track record of collaboration and success within our University.*

*On Friday, the Executive Committee of the Board will meet to appoint long-time University of Illinois leader Robert Easter to assume the role of president-designate. Bob stepped up for this university in some of our toughest days, as interim chancellor immediately following the disappointing and disruptive days of 2009, and he repaired and rebuilt the campus both literally and figuratively. Bob started at the U. of I. as a doctoral student, and then 36 years ago, as a faculty member. He was dean of the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences before acting as interim provost and then interim chancellor, then retiring, just briefly, last October. He came back again and currently serves as interim vice chancellor for research on the Urbana campus. Dr. Easter views this University as a great educator of students and a research powerhouse destined to fulfill our land-grant mission though new ideas that create businesses, jobs and new taxes to benefit the state. He has the trust of alumni and trustees past and present, as well as faculty, administrators and staff, and always, the best interest of students at heart. Following a transition period, he will be president beginning July 1.* 

*The Board joins me in wishing Mike well and in welcoming Bob back to play another key role for our beloved University of Illinois.*


*Sincerely,*
*Christopher G. Kennedy*
*Chairman, Board of Trustees*

Here are a few tips to save you some dough I've learned over the past 3.5 years as a student from a low-income family:

* 1) All instructors are required to make texts available on reserve (usually at the main stacks or ugl). If the instructor is giving you a BS ""invest in your education"" response or is resisting to do so in any way explain how not putting the book on reserve (either in a library or on e-reserves) is an act of discrimination against low income students. **Be polite in emails** and go above your professor only if they refuse to put something on reserve.

* 2) Use our library system! There are usually a few copies of smaller books/novels in one of the over 20 libraries on campus. Check early before the semester starts and you can renew a book up to 4 times (that's 14 weeks).

* 3) Use the I-SHARE system (http://vufind.carli.illinois.edu/all/vf/). You can use your UIUC Library account to access this. Basically how this works is you search a database of university libraries in Illinois for books you need. If you find it, and you usually will, you can request the book to be sent to UIUC's main stacks where you can check it out. You can renew up to 4 times with these books as well.

* 4) Help yourself and other Illini by using the Illini Book Exchange (http://www.illinibookexchange.com/splash.php5). Here you can buy and sell used texts (this is especially nice for harder to find math/science/engineering texts).

* 5) Rent you texts! You can do this at one of the local greedy textbook shops or online through various websites (Amazon, Chegg, etc..). Shop around for the cheapest rate for a semester.

* 6) If you absolutely need to buy a text, don't go to Follets, TIS, or the Union Bookstore unless you can't find cheaper options online. These stores are convenient but are almost always incredibly expensive.

* 7) Buy or rent older editions of textbooks. Many professors write the books for their classes and require students to buy the most up to date edition. 9 out of 10 times these new editions are just scams to get more money. Most professors will be honest when you ask if an older edition is okay, so be sure to ask. If they say you need the newest edition (usually a response if they wrote the book), ask exactly why. Chances are the old one will work just fine.

* 8) Share texts with friends. If you need to buy an expensive text, share the financial burden with someone else! A $150 text isn't as daunting when you split it with a friend. Just be sure to create a fair plan for who uses the book when (this can lead to conflict near exam time).

* 9) Thank your professors/TA's who make every effort to get texts on reserves and help you find the cheapest option. It is always refreshing to meet a university instructor who actually cares about you as a student.

* Hope these help! Please comment with any additional tips.

[University Housing Technology Services](http://housing.illinois.edu/technology).
  
**Ratelimiting Classes**: Yes, the current thresholds are 2GB and 5GB, combined upload and download. We are working on (possibly Fall 2012) adding a new, asymmetric limit. Think 4GB down, 2GB up for class B and then something like 8GB down and 4GB up for class A. These numbers are entirely speculation at this point, but we are working to not only go to a system like this, but also increase the amount of bandwidth included in the caps due to a decreasing cost of bandwidth. The most popular methods of downloading large files that I've heard of are either using WiFi in a lounge or library, or downloading them on a computer lab machine (100Mb/s). [Negated Void](http://www.reddit.com/user/NegatedVoid) pointed out that more tech-savvy users can figure out how to download through the lab machines to their local machine.  
  
**Wireless**: Currently Wireless halls include Barton, Lundgren, Nugent, Daniels, Busey-Evans, and new for Fall 2012 - Scott! These are currently not monitored at all for bandwidth, and you are free to use as much as you please (this is how I download most of my Steam games, OS images, etc). Even if you don't live in one of these halls, you should be fine to go sit in the lounge for an hour while it download so you can play uninterrupted in your room after it installs. Note that as wireless becomes more widespread, CITES and Housing are looking to develop a rate limiting system based on NetID. Note that since you are logged in with your NetID (through either IllinoisNet or UIUCNet), the university can still bust you for illegal activity.  
  
**MAC Spoofing**: This is something we are very aware of, and one of the few things we actually hunt. We can look at rooms that are going through the most traffic, and if there's an abnormally high amount of traffic and MAC addresses in your room, we will call you on it. First time, probably a cease and desist email. Second time, you might have to actually meet with someone. That being said, we don't look at rooms that just exceed their regularly allotted amount - that's what the rate limiting system is for. If we see you doing a few gigs a day through connections that are most likely file sharing, we don't care. We do not address copyright issues until a copyright holder contacts us with your IP.  
  
**Whitelisting**: Another thing we are working on is getting certain sites (Netflix, Hulu, Youtube) whitelisted. We understand that these video services can eat up your limit almost instantly, but we are very near a solution for this. I wouldn't be surprised if at least Netflix and Youtube were whitelisted at some point during the Fall 2012 semester. Unfortunately Netflix [stopped using Akamai](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericsavitz/2012/06/05/netflix-shifts-traffic-to-its-own-cdn-akamai-limelight-shrs-hit/) as it's primary CDN this Summer which has put a bit of a hiccup in the plan. All on-campus traffic is whitelisted, and you can download (nearly) any Linux distro from [COSMOS](http://cosmos.cites.uiuc.edu).  
  
**Quarantine Networks**: While the CITES security team is responsible for all of the quarantining that takes place on campus (RESnet and Wireless), we as NetTechs only have the power to reenable RESnet rooms. Infected machines are flagged by traffic between machines and known bad hosts, and when we come in your room looking to clean an infection, we typically know what we're looking for. Unfortunately, cleaning these things often takes persistence and false positives can occur making our job all the more difficult.   
  
**Copyright Infringement**: Torrenting itself is legal, it's just commonly used to share files illegally.  We can see if your room is connecting to an abnormally large number of peers, but we can't see what you're doing with them. For this reason, **we (housing) will never confront a student about downloading copyrighted materials without first receiving a claim from a copyright holder**. The university receives an IP from a company typically hired by the copyright holder, and then it is the NetTechs job to follow up with them and make sure the content is removed. NetTechs have no power over these tickets aside from aiding the RDs in checking out a computer. We are not the ones that disable copyright rooms, nor are we the ones to reenable them.

 As some of you know, during winter break, an impersonation scandal emerged concerning a high ranking member of the administration. 
Although this issue has been getting a lot of attention in this subreddit, I worry that winter vacation has kept many from hearing about it and perhaps not everyone has been able to regularly follow the developments.

 The new semester is beginning, and those of you who have missed the recent discussion may hear people on campus talking about this scandal. The investigation is complete, but the full report is quite lengthy (202 pages with appendices) and so I wanted to give a summary that contains everything we now know from start to finish in an easy to follow narrative, which is based on the independent investigation by forensic investigation firm, Duff &amp; Phelps:

**Impersonation Scandal at University of Illinois**

On December 12, 2011, two anonymous emails were sent to 20 members of the University of Illinois Senates Conference (USC) signed by a person posing as a “Senator”. 
 These emails concerned a controversial initiative over how much association the three University of Illinois campuses should have in terms of admissions and enrollment. Generally, the University of Illinois President, Michael Hogan, prefers more centralization, while the faculty tend to prefer keeping the campuses processes separate. The anonymous senator urged the USC, which is composed of 20 University of Illinois faculty members, to say they are unable to reach a consensus. 

This suggestion is controversial because without a consensus, Hogan could then bypass the Senate’s recommendation when making his decision on the centralization initiative. The anonymous suggestion encouraged divisiveness within the group by asking members to speak their dissent, and many in the USC took issue both with the author’s position and decision to use anonymity.

However, Roy Campbell, a Senates Conference member and computer science professor at the UIUC campus, noted that the text of the first anonymous email contained information from MS Word, and this information indicated that the email had been composed on a computer containing the user account “troyer.” 

“Troyer” is the last name of Michael Hogan’s then Chief of Staff/executive assistant, Lisa Troyer, who is not part of the USC nor represents their interests. Troyer has been with Hogan at three universities (Illinois, Iowa, and Connecticut) and was given immediate tenure upon arriving at UIUC with a $195,000 salary (now $200,850). According to a full forensics investigation that was launched upon Lisa Troyer’s implication, we know the following from her phone logs, e-mails, computers, and witness statements:

Troyer had written to Hogan earlier in the week, expressing frustration with the senators' opposition to the change in enrollment. She told him that despite the disagreement with the USC, the Board of Trustees will nevertheless support him. Her e-mail ended with, “I hope tomorrow gives you a new view and that you have a better day.” 

That evening,  Troyer created an anonymous e-mail account on Yahoo!, and sent messages titled “test” to her university e-mail address. The content of these messages criticized individual members of the USC.

Despite not being a member of the USC, Troyer was kept informed of the meetings by UI Springfield Professor Tih-Fen Ting. The following day, Tih-Fen Ting forwarded to Troyer another leak—the USC task draft report. (Tih-Fen Ting would later lie to investigators about sending these leaked e-mails to Troyer). In this draft report, a strategy is outlined by USC leaders to write to Hogan as a unified group, so that Hogan cannot say they are divided and to avoid a public relations disaster. Troyer and Hogan wrote an e-mail the next day to the Board Chair, Chris Kennedy, expressing displeasure with the new strategy that was leaked to them.

Two days later, Troyer creates another anonymous Yahoo! account and sends the first anonymous e-mail to the USC. Troyer told investigators that she was in a meeting at this time (11:56 am) with the Vice President for Academic Affairs (VPAA). However, the VPAA told investigators he arrived in Lisa Troyer’s office around 12:10 or 12:15, and that their meeting was quickly interrupted by a phone call from Michael Hogan. Troyer’s phone records show a call from Hogan at 12:16 pm.

Many who received the first anonymous email objected to the spirit of the message and the anonymity employed by the writer. Troyer sends another e-mail in reply stating that anonymity is used because of the growing divide and hostility within the USC and asks for continuing debate over consensus in the group. She also asks for the USC to not look into the person who leaked the draft report (i.e. USC member Ting) because it probably came from a person outside the group. During this time, records show that Troyer had her laptop at her home, and was actively using it with the internet tethered to her cell phone. This finding indicates that no one but Lisa could have been accessing the computer when these e-mails were sent.

It is after this second e-mail that Roy Campbell notices the information in the e-mail that identifies Troyer. He writes to the rest of the Senate and informs them of his finding.

Tih-Fen Ting, the UIS faculty member who kept Troyer informed on the USC meetings and leaked Troyer the USC draft report, calls Troyer to tell her that her username “troyer” had been connected with the anonymous e-mails. Tih-Fen Ting then forwards  Campbell’s e-mail to Troyer. 

Four minutes after their phone conversation, Troyer searches for how to permanently delete files from her computer, and initiates the “secure erase” program. She changes the default setting to the highest deletion setting (enough to remove all forensic trace of information). However, after seeing how long the process will take, Troyer aborts the program. Lisa Troyer admits to deleting some files that night. The program log files indicate that it had never been used previously.

Lisa Troyer then calls Michael Hogan. Hogan advises her to contact Michael Hites, the University’s Executive CIO and Associate Vice President, Administrative Information Technology Services. She expresses to him concern that her computer was hacked. She then has a series of phone calls with Hogan, Ting, and Hites.

The University Ethics Office and the Office of University Counsel conducted a full investigation. The investigation found that the file systems on the Troyer Laptop did not contain any known virus, malware, Trojan, or other potentially malicious software. Additionally, the system activity on the Troyer Laptop was consistent with network activity reported by the University IT Dept., and found no inconsistencies that would indicate malicious activity.

In summary, no unusual activity was identified, nor were there any other signs indicating remote access of the Troyer Laptop by a third party. Further, the organization of Troyer’s office, her  work schedule, University network firewall, the firewall on Troyer’s laptop, the security of university e-mail account,  artifacts found on Lisa Troyer’s computer, and extensive, detailed and current information about the various discussions and issues surrounding the enrollment management issue make it highly unlikely that anyone but Troyer could have sent those anonymous e-mails. After being presented with the forensic findings, Lisa Troyer has offered no alternative explanation.

Lisa Troyer, resigned as chief of staff for President Hogan, but remains a tenured member of the psychology faculty. Her tenure will be up for review in the coming days and only Michael Hogan can revoke it under the University Statutes. Some commenters believe it unlikely that Troyer’s tenure will be revoked due to her close association with Hogan. Despite the events that transpired (i.e. her impersonation of influential faculty, attempt to divide a recommendation committee, high cost imposed to the University through an extensive forensics investigation, lack of publishing/research, and possible damage done to the University’s ranking), the status of her tenure is still unknown.

The Senate Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure will, however, play a very significant role in any discussions of Troyer's tenure or potential sanctions. This committee, chaired by Matthew Finkin, investigates possible infringement of academic freedom and allegations of violations of the role of faculty in governance as specified in the University Statutes.  From their investigations, they submit recommendations and reports to the Chancellor and the Senate.

**A Personal Plea**

This investigation cost money and time that could have been spent funding research, preventing more furloughs, or giving scholarships to students. All of this could have been saved if Troyer had merely taken responsibility for her actions.

We need to let the administration, the students, and most importantly the general public  know that we do not tolerate this type of behavior here. Not only can we recover the costs associated with her investigation by revoking her tenure, but I think we can make things better than they were by sending a message to the public that we take unethical behavior more seriously than any other institution.

1375416958.0	1jjmdz	PSA: Don't let your research lab abuse you	biopsych	71	9	32	"Dear undergrads (such as myself),

To those of you who are new to the field of research, please be smart about finding the right opportunities to distinguish you as an applicant to the grad school or med school of your choosing. Doing grunt work for a lab for several semesters is ""better than nothing"", but it's really not going to put you into a competitive grad school. Frankly, some of the researchers on this campus are taking advantage of us by offering us ""opportunities"" that offer us minimal benefit in the long run. I'm talking about situations where undergrads aren't taught enough about what the lab is doing, not properly introduced to what it's like to be a researcher, and not given any sort of significant independence or ability to perform as an actual scientist. I know this first hand. 

I don't mean to say that undergrads shouldn't do grunt work, but it's unethical to let undergrads do grunt work with nothing in return. A 290 credit is practically worthless as it doesn't affect your GPA, it doesn't affect the number of hours you have for the Dean's List, and there is no benefit to you to have your research listed in your transcript because it will be on your application or your resume regardless. Edit: This is true for pass/fail 290s but be wary of 290s that assign you a grade based on an essay. Undergrads need to be able to grow as scientists if they're going to be taken seriously by future institutions.

Here are some tips on how to find a good lab. If anyone else has anything to say, please comment and I'll add it to the list.

* Don't agree to work in a lab before asking what kinds of things undergrads are able to do there. The idea is that you should be working there with the goal of doing something more impressive within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. writing a paper, presenting other researcher's papers to a group).

* Ask if there are weekly meetings, and if so what goes on there. Ideally people should be presenting and discussing papers on a weekly basis.
* You should be seeking out your lab, not the other way around. If a lab is searching for undergrad help somewhere on campus, there's probably a reason why they can't get enough. Figure out what topics you would be interested in studying (in general, you don't have to have a passion for it already), and then contact the PIs (principle investigators) of those labs and ask them if they need help. Don't stress out about it, you're basically asking them if they need free help. Just be respectful and professional.
* You're not a lab tech, don't let them treat you like one. You're there to learn, and you're not getting paid to do menial labor. At the same time, be ready to pay your dues as thanks to the researchers who will hopefully help you move on to the next big thing.
* Just an FYI, if you're going to med school - most of the med schools in Illinois don't want a letter from your PI (they want it from professors or pre-med advisors), so do your research before you waste a semester trying to get a letter of recommendation. 

The University of Illinois is a world-class research institution. Don't fall into a trap as you're looking for the right lab for you."	t5_2qkxs	True

If you had recent problems with SE, it might be worth filing a BBB complaint as well.	scootey	89	31	17	"**EDIT and NOTE -  6/26/13:** Changed text for SE link. I have heard concern about SE tracking visitors' IP/origin with emphasis on Reddit traffic, and possibly using this data in a bad way. [ArsTechnica article.](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/06/bus-co-owner-threatens-redditor-yet-again-records-users-ip-addresses/) They do get your IP address and originating URL. Unless they have evidence to subpoena your ISP, there's little useful info about your IP alone. They know it's a visitor from Reddit, the pages visited on their site, (if they look it up) the town that it's in, and some misc data about your browser. Based on origin URL, they could display remarks  ([""welcome paranoid reddit users""](http://i.imgur.com/QkGZamg.png)) or ban you...that's about it though. I wouldn't worry about going to their site unless you have personal reason to.

**MAIN POST:**

Hey folks, I'm sorry to clutter the front page with yet another SE post.

But I noticed Suburban Express is now proudly proclaiming their ""A+ Rating with BBB"" on the front page of their website. [Link.](http://suburbanexpress.com/indexuiuc.html) They link to the [listing for SubEx](http://www.bbb.org/central-illinois/business-reviews/bus-lines/suburban-express-in-champaign-il-5001684) on the Better Business Bureau's website. It indeed shows that they maintain an A+ rating according to the Central Illinois BBB. I'd think that it would be at least a notch lower, given the issues (and their incredibly poor handling) that have been widely publicized over previous months. Also, BBB reported having received 8 complaints over the past 36 months, with 7 categorized as ""Problems with Product / Service"".

But anyway...**if you recently had a bad experience with Suburban Express, I encourage you to file a report against them with the BBB** (if you haven't already.) **[Link to BBB complaint form for SE.](http://www.bbb.org/central-illinois/business-reviews/bus-lines/suburban-express-in-champaign-il-5001684/file-a-complaint) Use this ONLY for serious and legitimate complaints. Do not falsify or hyperbolize your claims, or send fake/malicious/""troll"" reports. Be reasonable, honest, and concise.** Hopefully this would make them aware of a problem with SE (they're not a member anyway), and maybe lead to SE no longer displayed as an ""A+"" business with no problems. If relevant to your situation, also consider filing a complaint with the state Attorney General and/or other offices where relevant.

The BBB page on SE also points out that SE doesn't have BBB accreditation. ""Accreditation"" is their membership program where businesses pay an annual fee and BBB somehow monitors their business practices. If all is good, they can mention their BBB membership in advertising, and presumably access other BBB benefits. I figure SE (or Dennis) just isn't interested in dealing with them. And it wouldn't surprise me if SE's business practices were too poor to even meet [BBB's accreditation standards](http://heartofillinois.bbb.org/bbb-accreditation-standards). Even if SE tried to join BBB, chances are they couldn't.

Of course I know that the BBB isn't popular with everyone...it's received its fair share of criticism, such as that they tend to act in the interests of member businesses rather than consumers or the general public. I wouldn't use the BBB as my *only* source of information to find reputable businesses, especially today. However, some people do. They might see the BBB as a reliable source of information about which businesses are or aren't reputable. Or they may be new to the US (eg international students), and mistake the BBB for a government agency when it's not. (oh yeah, and please note that I'm not a lawyer, and that this post doesn't constitute legal advice.)"	t5_2qkxs	True

Edit: All comments compiled onto here, and into one large comment below.

How To: UIUC edition

**GET AN APARTMENT:**

-Email the tenant union. Give specifications like town, price range, size (bedrooms), and furnished/unfurnished.

-Don’t use CPM or University Group

Urbana tends to be cheaper, but it's farther from the bars. The farther from campus you are, the cheaper it will be.

-Expect to start leasing for an apartment in early october the year before you want to live there. Yeah, it starts fast

-Don't feel the need to live in an apartment sophomore year--don't sign a lease with your brand-new-dorm-friends before you really know them.


**OH EM GEE I’M AN INCOMING FRESHMAN:**

-No one cares about if you’ll get into UIUC or not, your ACT score, or whatever. Do not post about that. Nor should you ask about some obscure program and expect a large response. There’s 1000 people on here, its not a great representation. Use the schools website, or advisors. At least use the search function first!!

*Tips on what to bring your freshman year...from an Iguide!*

from TaikongXiongmao:
For dorm stuff, don't go crazy and buy a bunch of stuff before you get down here, buy it after you've moved all your stuff in and deemed it necessary and know that you have room. ESPECIALLY MIRRORS. As someone who worked as an iGuide for 2 years, it WILL break. The outdoor trash cans are full of them every year &gt;_&lt; Buy one at target or walmart, after you've moved in so you can carry it the whole drive back.

Other things I would recommend:

    A cushion for your chair (it can be a pillow from home, doesn't have to specifically be for a chair)

    A desk light, and for that light, a blue light bulb. I know that may sound little weird, but trust me, if either you or your roommate is going to be coming in after one of you is asleep, it is a life saver! No one gets mad because the extra bright room light is on, or that they can't see and end up tripping over everything.

    A cheap box fan, you'll use it for the first 3 weeks and the last 3 weeks and that's it.

    Mattress topper, those dorm mattresses are shit, a good night's sleep (or nap) is worth it.

    A small dry erase board, but that's mostly just for shiggles :D

Things I would NOT recommend:

    An entirely new chair. You won't have room and the dorm chairs are fine if you throw a pillow on it.

    A floor lamp of any sort. Again, no room, and a desk lamp is enough.

    Buying sheets before you get there! My parents insisted that my bed would be a ""x-long twin"" but the website lies, it's just a twin.

    A TV (your dorm friends will have one). Or at least make sure you and your roommate aren't both bringing one.

The YMCA Dump and Run is a great way to get a bunch of random things you might need for super cheap, from a laundry basket to a shitty futon. One of my favorite beginning of the year things to do :D

-*Guide to the dorms*

Allen is artsy, quirky, semi-loud but decently friendly. Trees. Decently close to quad

-Busey-Evans is quiet, and all girls. Close to Quad. air conditioning

-LAR is Busey Evans, but with boys recently added.

Ikenberry-Has its own rec center, lots of amenities, competitive (sophs and jrs). brand new

Six pack--Loud, fun, ke$ha video essentially. as far from the quad as par/far

ISR-Quiet, nerdy, but you can make it fun AND study. Lots o’ Asians. Air conditioning

PAR/FAR: Large international and black community, far away, good food and nice furniture. Far has air conditioning

Private housing-quiet, expensive, food isn’t as great as they make it out. Isolating, and not very diverse. Plus, you can only get into your dorm's kitchen. With public dorms, you can eat in any of the 7 dorms--nice when you have friends in a different dorm, you want greasy food (PAR!) or you live far away and want to eat between classes (Busey-Evans)

-You’ll be fucking fine without air conditioning, chill out and get a fan.

-don’t buy all that nonsense your parents think you need because they read it in a parenting magazine. They tell you how important desk lamps and macbooks and drapes and pop up hampers and such are--feel out your first 2 weeks without the frilly things, and see what you need afterward. They have computer labs in the dorms. If your roommate is out partying every night, you won't need a desklamp.

-Buying a minifridge (not really necessary) costs the same as renting one. Will become beer fridge post dorms

*Recommendations on laptops and computing*
Don't feel like you have to get a laptop:many people only bring them to class to use FB, sometimes to take notes (CS majors may be different). Many people say they're good for studying in the library or group collaboration, but they have computers in every library, and someone else will always have one. Also, keep in mind weight: if it's heavy, you're not going to want to carry it around everywhere, and it might be a better investment to get a netbook and a good desktop. Also keep in mind battery life: 2.5 hours will get you through 2 classes.

from neoblackdragon:
When it comes to a computer. I think it depends fully on your needs. If your just doing basic stuff like surfing the web and writing papers then a ""cheap"" good laptop is all you need. You don't need a hardcore laptop and you don't need an overpriced macbook. Do your research before you buy. Thinkpads are a good place to start. Go into desktop territory if your a person who run programs that need the power. You don't need to be a gamer for that. If your in the Art program, Desktops are good for the power and price(and I would go custom). CS/ENGINEERING is shaky. A more powerful machine makes executing programs faster.

But if you got 2000 dollars to spend. DO NOT BUY A MAC. Buy yourself another brand(stay away from dell). Save yourself some money. I have found many mac pro professors and students are not choosing the line because Macs are inherently better but because they don't know how to use a computer(or they they've been on the MAC OSX for so long that the Windows/Linux OS seem to foreign).

I'd say looks toward a decent priced laptop first while in the dorms. If you find you need a desktop, get it when your move to an apartment.

from mysassyassy:
One more thing, you do not need to spend 2k on a macbook, unless you are doing graphics design or so. A netbook will suffice because it is light, has plenty of battery power, and it is not expensive.

*pros/cons of laptops vs desktops*
from vxxk:
Desktops are not portable and sometimes you might need to do work on a computer outside your dorm but computers in labs/libraries are not accessible. Laptops, on the other hand, are prone to theft. I recommend to just bring a laptop unless you are a hardcore gamer, or require desktop for a specific purpose, or you simply can't afford a laptop. Do not buy Apple as Windows, or Linux, will be cheaper and will perform the same function. 

Note: outside the dorms, there are plenty of ICS computer labs! Besides the pcs in EVERY library (Math, Classic, UGL, whatever), which in the more popular studying libraries, there are mac labs scattered around campus.
they are free for any student and offer printing for .08/.40 BW/Color.
They are located in: Southwest corner of the union
Northeast corner of the UGL
On Nevada (Behind La Casa)
Oregon and Lincoln
Basement of Wohlers
Basement of English building


**Class Recommendations:**
*MUS 133

*PS 100/101

*PSYC 100

GWS 100 and CHLH 206 are easy as shit. --from frycicle. I won't lie though, watch out in the GWS department dudes.


You can also do concurrent enrollment at Parkland (the community college near UIUC). They have online classes that are probably easier than the UIUC equivalent.


**Guide to the Bars and specials:**
You can get in at 18 in urbana, 19 in champaign. Can’t buy liquor till 21. 

Campus Bars:
Joes
Clybourne
Brothers
Kams
Murphys

FuBar
Red Lion
White Ho

Off-campus:
Great for a change of pace. C-street is a great gay bar for dancing!

from Kanno:if you dont like the campus bars, downtown champaign has quite a few awesome bars, and a good music scene. especially if you like nice beer. blind pig, mike n mollys, boltini, cowboy monkey, radio maria are all good bars downtown. if you like dives go to the brass rail and have a squint. thelt: esquire long islands!

**FIND A JOB:**

[Virtual Job Board] (https://secure.admin.illinois.edu/osfa/vjb/index.aspx)

**PARKING:**

Hard to get free 3-day parking in Urbana, north of green, east of Lincoln.

Free parking in the University lots on weekends.


**GOOD RESTAURANTS:**

KoFusion-Sushi, dollar sushi pieces on Sunday/Monday

Sushi Kame-sushi, not as well known, but just as good!

Jim Gould-Steak, pricey

Merry Ann's--Drunk food, in three locations

Jarlings-Ice Cream

Courier Café (american, good for parents)

Café Kopi (Coffee)

Black Dog (BBQ)

Das Café (german)

Cravings (Chinese)

Firehaus (burgers and wings)

from ktina:

Farren's-burgers!

Bacaro: great Italian edit: wine.

Destihl downtown has good food and their own microbrewery inside (their stout is to die for).

from cedarSeagull: Champaign has a huge diaspora of Korean and Chinese people. Because of this, we have excellent Chinese restaurants. I've heard Chinese students say that apart from NYC and the California that we have the best Chinese food in the US. Check out Golden Harbour (Neil and Healey) and Bobo China (4th and Green). Do yourself a favor and don't order from the American menu. Also, Woori Jib is outstanding Korean food.

She claims she is pregnant and needs the money for food; she also mentioned something about her sister.  She is large enough that it would be hard to tell if she is lying about the pregnancy.  I saw and talked to her about an hour ago, and told her politely that I recognized her and her story, and would not give her any money.

About this same time last year this same woman asked me for cash further down the street (Wright and Daniels-ish) with the same story, and I gave her eight bucks.  She also got my friend (independently) about 10 minutes later for ten bucks with the same schtick.  We talked about it later and decided that she was probably scamming us, but didn't care enough to pursue the matter further.

There is a chance that independently, two near-identical looking women with near-identical stories happened to both ask me for money within the same one-block radius at the same time of year.  I hope that I am wrong, but sincerely doubt it.

Just trying to help my fellow UIUC-ers not waste their money or feel bad for not doing so.  If anyone has corraborating stories or other info please let me know!

1368201625.0	1e2p7z	Yet another fun Suburban Express Story!!	vdubzzz	76	21	44	"This is my first post on Reddit ever, but I have to vent my frustration somewhere. My mistake was buying from Suburban Express in the first place, after my experience early this morning I regret not reading on this sub more.

I was on a 4am bus to O'hare -- an hour and half into the bus ride I woke up from my nap to see we are stopped outside a Denny's in bumfuck nowhere (well at least it had a Denny's). I figured it was just a pit stop and didn't quite mind. Then the driver announces that he just got a call from who I now think was probably Dennis the Menace that they have detected duplicate tickets. The two passengers were called out, and they talked to the man on the phone as well as the driver to try to clear things. From what I gathered, they must have submitted the same ticket, but they had two DIFFERENT confirmation e-mails that they showed the driver. They didn't have any further proof, and I'm not even sure if that was legitimate. We were sitting there for about 40 minutes, waiting for what seemed like nothing, and that's when the driver was told to call law enforcement to help intimidate these guys. We waited there in silence (again this was 5:30 AM) for the fucking police to show up. Ultimately, I guess the two customers couldn't plead their case well enough, because after about 10-15 more minutes, the driver opened up the trunk and that's when we all knew they weren't coming back on the bus. They were left stranded at Denny's with the police officers, and then we were off once again.

My biggest problem with this is how they made their ""honest"" customers wait for OVER an HOUR just so they could fuck with their ""fraudulent"" customers and kick them off the bus in again, bumfuck nowhere. I don't know the entire story, so it's hard to jump to conclusions as to whether or not they were guilty. I'm lucky, my flight had a nice two hour buffer. But that probably wasn't the case with many of the passengers on the same bus as me. In that recent e-mail they said they value their customers tremendously. They sure do have a very interesting way of showing their appreciation of us. "	t5_2qkxs	True

We get multiple people multiple times a week that come down and say their stuff was taken while they went to the bathroom or got food or slept. Leave your stuff only if you have a friend who is watching it, otherwise take it with. You know the North entrance circulation desk? Even when we go back to the circ desk we take all our stuff with us. Even employee's belongings have been taken if we weren't watching it.

Do not save desks. This is particularly hated because your junk gets stolen and then you are sad. We do not like to see you sad. Hence, do not save desks.

The people with the clickers are just doing a patron count. It happens every three hours and is essential to determining funding for Grainger for the next year, so while I know it annoying for two minutes, it means you have more 24-hour places to study next year.

Late fees on reserve books are serious shit. We do write down exactly when the book was given back so returning it four hours late with people waiting to check it out and then trying to tell us a week later you turned it in on time will not fly.

If someone is being loud and obnoxious or talking on their cell phone (YES even on the fourth floor), come down to the circ desk and tell us. We will happily warn them and, if necessary, invite them to study somewhere else.

Also the study rooms on the fourth floor: these are designed for group use. Group meaning more than one person. If there is a group who wants to study and we see multiple rooms being taken up by one person, we are supposed to kick you out. Also, you cannot check out the three locked study rooms on a whim. You need a reservation and to fill out a form 24 hours in advance EVEN if no one is in it or scheduled to use it. We do not have study rooms to check out to people because people wrecked them, filled them with trash, and drew on the walls."	t5_2qkxs	True

If you'd like to help me maintain the spreadsheet or you'd like to post discussion or news about specific suits, visit /r/SuburbanExpressSuits. 

I see /r/SuburbanExpressSuits as a good place to discuss the details of a specific suit (like the question ""what's up with 2013SC40, where they filed asking for transfer of venue?"") since that kind of detail would clutter /r/uiuc a bit much. But general news articles about the topic should stay here in /r/uiuc. I'm not trying to split the discussion, just provide a place for people who are interested in more detail than the general group might want to hear about.

I've just gotten to the point where i feel like an idiot when everyone i meet seems to be an engineer that treated calculus like a joke and talks about a 12 page lab report like it's nothing. I barely passed Calc I &amp; II and can't seem to get an A in anything that involves math anymore (calc, stats, etc).

I know i'm not dumb, and i know you all work really hard too, but it's hard for me to handle everyone being smarter than me. I feel like what I'm doing is a joke compared to all these people studying the hard sciences,etc. I do all my homework( though i procrastinate like crazy) and go to all my classes but i just don't get good grades in any of the classes that are actually difficult/important. 

I know all these people who go out all week long, have great social lives and are definitely in harder classes than i am. How do you guys tell yourself to push through everything? I just can't seem to sit down, put all my effort in and accomplish anything anymore until the night before or hours before its due. Now I've never had issues with anxiety or depression, but I have started to get really anxious on Sundays after the fun subsides and the homework ensues. It's like mild anxiety and jealousy just overruns my thought process, but i'm fine the other 6 days of the week.

So anyway, for all those who are the smart ones, don't be modest, share a little. And for all those who are in the same boat as me, I can't be the only one, so share some thoughts too. I just need something constructive to keep me going and maybe just some good advice.


**Update**: Thanks everyone for sharing whatever advice/experiences you had. I like having many points of view to take from. Hopefully I can get a little of my confidence back and find ways to boost my study habits and grades.

not a student was drinking and townies hunkered down 


The Handles and beer kegs were prepared with care 


In the hopes that a great party would soon be declared


The Students were nestled all snug in their beds 


While visions of drinking games were played in their heads 


And St. Patrick in his hat and KAM with his beer 


Had just ended the preparations for the rager of the year


When out on the Quad there arose such a clatter


I sprang from my bunk to see what was the matter. 


Away to the window I flew like the flash 


Tore open the blinds and the window with a crash


The moon on the breast of the newly cleaned street 


Gave the luster of St Patty’s day to the drunks on their feet 


When, what to my wondering eyes should appear


 But a gigantic keg, and eight enormous cheap beers


With a little old redhead, so wasted and daft 


I knew in a moment it must be St Pat 


More rapid than eagles his beverages they came 


And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!

“Now Natty! Now Keystone! Now, Blue Moon and Bud Light! 


On Blue Ribbon! On Fosters on Busch and Coors light! 


Go into the bars! Into the sororities and frats!


Now drink away! drink away! Until the whole world goes black!""

For many students, especially many from the Chicago suburbs, this is their first experience with a large population of people foreign to them. Likewise, people from foreign countries studying abroad are experiencing what Americans are like in a large number.

A recent event that had me thinking about this was the Facebook group ""University of Illinois Memes"", where the group was restricted by the university due to many students posting racial attacks on the minorities on the campus.

Being Caucasian, I have noticed trends that are common of other races. While I hate to say that stereotypes exist, I feel there are general traits present that stem from culture differences, as my roommate from China explained to me.

Oh and dudes, stop asking for ""cute girls"". There's no picture section of the application, and I can't work with something I don't have.

EDIT4: Current ratio 5:2.

Hip hip hoorah. Once the final shirt is chosen, I'll contact 2-3 different companies about pricing (one of which takes online orders! but which doesn't give you a ""buy in bulk"" discount :( ), let you guys know the best price, and collect dinero around the first week of school (16th-20th or so).

Do you enjoy climbing buildings or sneaking past security to catch a glimpse of the view from the roof? Or perhaps you like traversing the steam tunnels, drains, or other underground systems in C-U? Maybe you're fond of visiting abandoned structures to see the beauty in  urban decay? Either way, I've been doing all this for quite some time and have finally started a blog dedicated to the subject of urban exploration and infiltration in C-U.(http://catacombkid217.wordpress.com/). I've only made one post so far, but there is more to come. Anyway, I was wondering if anyone else engages in these activities and would have photos to submit or would possibly like to accompany me to visit some sites. I'm particularly interested in anyone who has a good camera and is half decent at using it; I can guarantee some unique pictures you won't get elsewhere!

I'd prefer the policy was just [be excellent to each other](http://thelxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Bill-and-Ted.jpg) But sometimes I'm forced to make decisions, and people have asked me for a set of rules, so here they are. Feel free to discuss them here or via moderator mail. Ask for clarification if you're confused.

Also, messaging the mods is the preferred way to report material you don't believe belongs. The report button gives no context and is often hit by mistake.

**Purpose**
This subreddit is primarily for any topic of interest to students, staff, faculty, alumni, etc of UIUC. Additionally, anything related to Urbana or Champaign is welcome.

**Sales, ads, voting, etc**
You're free to list your place for subletting, beg for facebook votes, advertise your UIUC-related web service, etc. For the most part, upvotes/downvotes will control it's visibility.

Except:

* No Throwaways: Man up and do it from your main account, one with history on /r/UIUC
* No SPAM: You may never, ever post an ad for the same thing twice. If you feel the need to (Let's say your scheduling website has been *totally redesigned*) - [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23UIUC) and ask permission.
* Details: All the required details of your post must be included. The moderators can and will remove your post (and inform you) for being way to vague.

**Personal Information**
[See Reddit's Policy](http://www.reddit.com/help/faq#Ispostingpersonalinformationok). 

* You can post the full name of people that work for the university, that's cool.

* You can post *your own* full name and *your own* contact information. You should not, however, post someone else's. Even if they have posted it before.

* First names are fine.

* Links to someone's facebook account are obviously personal information.

**Illegal Activities**
I know this section is pretty controversial. These guidelines are mostly to preserve the subreddit's reputation. Also, it would not surprise me if members of the police read this subreddit or if subreddit readers took it upon themselves to report things to them. Please, don't get in trouble.

* Do not buy/sell drugs on this subreddit. This includes hinting at wanting someone to PM you about your lack of a 'trees' hookup.

* You can, however, discuss drugs.

* Don't post asking for someone of age to buy you alcohol.

* You can, however, discuss the fact that you drink underage. It's even cool to say ""someone at a barcrawl will probably buy you drinks if you're nineteen"".

* You're free to discuss things like visiting the steam tunnels or accessing the roofs of buildings on campus. But please remember that the University takes these things *very seriously* and you can get in a lot of trouble if they figure out who you are.

**Trolling, excessive profanity, etcetc**
I expect the community to police these comments with downvotes, but if required I might moderate them. There will be less leniency for submissions."	t5_2qkxs	True

Check your statements, folks. And a little tip -- the Sliders people are completely unhelpful and will probably just tell you to call EatCU or Sliders Corporate. EatCU will tell you to call Sliders, and Corporate won't pick up at all. Call your credit card company and explain.

1323901403.0	ncxys	My adventure to the grave under Noyes Lab	beantrouser	54	10	32	"BACK STORY: Story has it that famous scientist Edward Williams Morley is buried in a hard to get location in the basement of Noyes.  Don't worry, it's a hoax and junk:
http://www.dailyillini.com/index.php/article/2009/03/unlucky_day_revives_urban_legends_at_university
Still cool though!

LOGISTICS: Enter Noyes through the North-West entrance, facing North, right by the Union.  There's a plaque by the entrance commemorating a cool thing the U of I did.  Something to do with water.
Go down the stairs.  There's this old lookin' brick hallway that's really warm.  Go straight though it.  About halfway through, on your right side, there'll be, like, a chain linked fence section that's locked up.  Behind the fence you'll see all these old computers, and lots of random papers lying around, and it'll be really dark.  You'll also notice a gap in the wall, kinda like the opening to an old school pizza oven.  This gap goes to what I'll call the Central Room.
Now, I understand that some people have gotten to the grave by continuing Southward down the hallway to a metal trap door in the floor, which takes them to a room just South of the Central Room, which is just South of the Grave Site Room.  But this trap door was bolted.
I also understand that another way people have reached the grave is by having a Chem student with keys to the old storage room just North of the Grave Site Room (door 14, I think?), and then would reach the grave by climbing over some ventilation stuff.  A pro to doing it this way is that it would be totally legal!  But the door was locked and didn't even have a door knob anymore, so that option was not viable as far as I know.
The chain linked fence locked up doorway that I mentioned earlier has about a foot and half gap from the top of it's doorway to a pipe that runs along the ceiling.  Enough room for most people.  I climbed up the door, slid between this gap, and entered through the pizza oven gap.

STORY: It was me and a couple friends, but I was the only one acrobatic enough to make it over the door.  I crawled through the pizza oven gap and found myself in what I now call the Central Room.  The floor was dirt.  A key sign that I was near the grave.
It was pitch dark in there.  All I had was my shitty old cell phone for light, and it was dying.  I was pretty creeped out.
This Central Room didn't really have much to it.  I think I remember a filing cabinet or two.  I decided to go left.  This led to a doorway to another room.  This room didn't seem to have a dirt floor.  A lot more junk though.  There was a light switch by this doorway on the Central Room's side.  I held my breath and flicked it on.  Nothing happened, probably for the best.  Wouldn't want to bring much attention to myself.
Next I went right/North.  There was this short, wooden door that led to a room that seemed to be even darker than the others.  I was pretty scared.  To my left, there was a stick in the ground.  I think I had seen that in previous pictures.  Farther to the left, dimly lit, I could make out the cross that I'd seen in all the pictures I'd seen of the grave.  I'd made it!  But before I went to further investigate that, further ahead/North, there was another doorway that caught my curiosity.
It was a square, umm, not a room, but a square floor with a shitty, short li'l step ladder that led to a ventilation thingy with enough room for someone to army crawl over.  I did just that (it was really, really warm!) and I could make out a much bigger room with a lot of tall filing-cabinet-like things.  I decided not to enter any further as there seemed to be a bit of a drop to the floor and I had already found the grave.
I crept back to the grave.  I could tell the picture of Edward Williams Morley was gone, but the cross seemed to still be perfectly intact.  There was a rectangular hole dug about a foot deep.  What I saw next made me quite quickly turn the fuck around and get the fuck outta that room.
I only got a glimpse because all I had was my not-so-powerful phone, but towards the head of the grave, buried in the dirt, were two pale faces, mouths open, seeming to be screaming in agony.
Back to the Central Room, with my friends in sight, and breathing kinda hard, I knew I wasn't going to leave it at that.  My curiosity was a little to strong to have my adventure end there.  I just needed an actual flashlight, and a camera.
We got those items and I returned.  Imagine seeing this, by yourself, only way, way darker:
http://i.imgur.com/iVtAo.jpg
So it turns out it was just someone's art project that they left down there (which is what I *totally* thought the whole time):
http://i.imgur.com/Cdvgr.jpg
and I guess I kinda just imagined the whole gaping-mouths thing:
http://i.imgur.com/Hr7ue.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/lBeS7.jpg

To whoever left those down there, you got me pretty good!

MORAL: I often see posts on r/UIUC for urban exploration.  We should totally try to organize something!  There's so much to explore!  I even was taught how to get on the roof of Noyes that night!  It's really awesome up there!

I’m a student at the University of York in the UK and I’m working on an application for an exchange to UIUC in the next academic year. I’m a history/philosophy undergrad and the program I’m applying for is a history specific single semester exchange. I’ve done an awful lot of googling about UIUC to try and make my application sound clever and informed but it’d really help if I could get a bit of input from a current or past student, particularly someone who has taken history/philosophy/medieval studies courses or similar. Idk … I really don’t just want to be quoting the website if I get an interview.

If you guys don’t mind I have a couple of massively general questions:
1.	Is there anything particularly special about liberal arts teaching at UIUC?
2.	 What’s awesome/interesting about the departments of history/philosophy/medieval studies? (i.e. range of courses, particular professors, whatever)
3.	If you were trying to sell UIUC (in a general sense) to a prospective student what sort of stuff would you say?

I’d really appreciate any help I can get. Also, I’m sure I’ll have a load more specific questions if I get accepted so if anyone is interested in corresponding (or you’ve got a friend who likes answering dumb questions) I’d be much obliged.

Would say I’d buy helpful redditors a beer if I get a place but I’m not legal in the US so I’ll buy you a non-alcoholic beverage of your choice.

Thanks loads.

edit: From all that I've learned in this experience, here are my keys to coming back stronger than ever:

1. Lower to 12 hours and aim for a 3.5 semester

2. Devote 10 hours of school focused time a day including class time, studying, office hours and homework

3. Take the time to review past material. Learn it better than you did before

4. Study lecture to lecture, homework assignment to homework assignment and you'll never have to cram

5. **Decide that you want it.** Don't just float around aimlessly. Find what ever reason you need to motivate yourself. Mine was the prestige of an engineering degree and raising myself to a respectable GPA that I was worth

We at MTD are happy to say that we're in the final stages of development for version 2.2 of our API. This new version will include vehicle tracking and access to reroutes--two of the features most commonly requested by our users and developers. We plan to release this version within the next couple of weeks, but in the meantime we've made a preview available so that developers can test the new functionality and help us find errors or bugs. If you're a developer (or if you know one) we'd love to know what you think of these changes! Reply here or email us at developer@cumtd.com.

**Developers:** You can try out version 2.2 of the API by using 2.2 as the version number in the usual [url structure](http://developer.cumtd.com/documentation/v2.1/Requests#url). This API is subject to change without notice; please **do not** use it in a production version of your app yet!

I will be running an AMAA on Sunday between 10 am and 2 pm about the union, federal mediation, and a potential work action.	uigeo	56	11	24	"My name is Lindsay Anderson, and I am one of the co-presidents of the [Graduate Employees' Organization](http://www.uigeo.org/) at UIUC. I have been a redditor for more than a year and thought that doing an AMAA would be a great chance to interact with students and answer questions. For those who are interested, I have verified with the moderators already.

As many of you already know, [the GEO has passed an authorization vote to go on strike](http://www.news-gazette.com/news/education/2012-11-16/geo-members-take-next-step-toward-strike.html). The state of Illinois requires that an authorization vote is taken before any strike can be declared, but in our organization, this vote does not mean we have declared a strike. Instead, based on our constitution, this vote creates a new committee with the executive power to declare, suspend, or call off a strike. 

For those of you who already have a good grasp on the issues but want to know how to get involved, [signing our petition is a great start, even if you're not a member](http://www.change.org/petitions/university-of-illinois-community-and-supporters-help-us-protect-tuition-waivers-for-teaching-assistants-and-graduate-assistants).

I teach two undergrad classes and have openly invited my students to e-mail me their direct questions or ask about rumors they have heard. I am inviting you to do the same. The goal of this is to help anyone who hasn't been a part of our negotiation process to understand what our priorities are, what has been achieved, and what we have yet to come to agreement on.

This is an AMAA, so please be warned that there are a few topics I cannot speak to:

* The start date of a work action/strike
* Buildings that would be targeted for picket lines
* How long a potential strike could last
* Whether your own graduate instructors will hold or cancel classes
* **Rampart** 

I hope to bring in one or two other union leaders to help answer questions tomorrow! 

Warmly,

Before I go on with my question, I'll give you guys a little background info on me to explain why I'm asking.

I transferred here in Fall 2010 as a sophomore. The only person that I knew (outside of friends of acquaintances) who went to Illinois was my boyfriend at the time. These two things are important because 1. I came here after the Chief was no longer our mascot and 2. Unlike many people who go here, I didn't have any friends or family who went to Illinois while the Chief was popular/still around (except for the bf) and therefore was never really exposed to that culture/""pride""/etc. So basically, I've never had any sort of ""allegiance"" to the Chief and don't really have much of an opinion either way, outside of a slight negative feeling.

The [APA](http://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/indian-mascots.aspx) and the [NCAA](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/news/story?id=2125735) both agree that the use of Native American mascots is harmful and creates a ""hostile environment"". I can definitely see where they're coming from.

So to those of you who support the use of the Chief: why? How do you feel about the views from organizations like the APA? 

**tl;dr: I came to this school after the Chief was retired and didn't know anyone who came here/was never exposed to love for the Chief. I don't really have much of an opinion either way and I'm curious as to why people are such strong defenders of the mascot.**

Thanks! =D

**Edit: Wow, I'm overwhelmed and surprised by the amount of feedback I've gotten! The vast majority of the responses were very calm and respectful on both sides, and I thank you for that; I was expecting a serious shitblizzard, to be honest!**

**It seems like this whole thing is broken down two different ways.**

**For: The Chief was a symbol of honor, leadership, unity, and other positive things. He brought the campus community together and was an important part of the University culture. The loss of this symbol has left a hole in the community. Since he was always portrayed respectfully, and had support from Native Americans at some point (?), it is unfair to call him racist and anyone who says otherwise is being oversensitive or is unaware of all of the details of the Chief. Some people have said that the Chief was banned simply because the NCAA wished it to be so, without any feedback from the campus community. Some people in this group respect the decision to cease use of the Chief, while some are very unhappy with it.**

**Against: The Chief is a racist caricature of what it means to be Native American. He would dress up in the expected attire, and do a dance that people would expect a Native American to do. The dance is offensive because it is based on stereotypical movements with Boy Scout routines or religious ceremonial dance (both have been stated in the comments), and the costume is offensive because there are parts of it that have significance with spirituality, community, and other important aspects of NA culture. Positive stereotypes/generalization are still harmful to minority groups, and the Chief and Native Americans are an example of this.**

**Overall, most of the comments have really helped me gain a better understanding of Chief Illiniwek and his impact on campus culture, both positive and negative. I'm very grateful for that, and am always open to more information!**"	t5_2qkxs	True

5. What is the department's plan to curb the recent crime wave?

In my 3.5 years on campus, I've seen all sorts of violent crime alerts including sexual assault and muggings. I've also seen campus cops raiding bars what seems to be every other weekend or so. I want to know why you focus on ""protecting us from our selves"" when you can't keep campus and students safe at our homes or educational buildings. 

EDIT: See below, it looks like there's a good chance someone from the department will stop by and answer some of this. I appreciate all of the productive conversation so far, it's educated me and others. If a CU police officer does stop by here, I suggest you start a new thread so you aren't bogged down by all the conversation already here. "	t5_2qkxs	True

1318353024.0	l8gv1	Career fair advice	usefulidiot127	44	5	24	"As an alum who's now been on the other side of things at the career fairs - I feel obligated to give you newbs some advice. I didn't figure this out until my junior year myself.

It's pretty simple to get a good response from recruiters at the career fairs. 75% of the students go about it the wrong way. I cannot tell you how many students come up to us (the recruiters) asking what we do, what kind of positions we offer, how I can help them get a job - etc. This is not a productive way to go about getting job/internship offers from a career fair. 

This is how you do it. 

1) Decide ahead of time that you are going to go to the career fair. Go as early as you possibly can. You want to leave an early lasting impression and have a thoughtful discussion with the recruiter before they get burned out after talking to 3000 other students. (For the love of god, do not show up 5 minutes before the career fair is scheduled to end)

2) Carefully look at every company that is attending. Decide which ones you are interested in and learn a few things about this company (especially if it's a smaller company). Now examine the job openings they have. Figure out which one(s) you want and come up with an elevator speech that specifically tells the recruiter why you are qualified for this position. 

3) Like I said before, get there early and go talk to the recruiters. Tell them you are interested in the company for reasons X, Y, Z. Follow up with why you think you would be a great fit for position A - and give a few more reasons. To really show you are interested - come up with a few thoughtful questions to ask about this position/company as well. 

4) At this point, the recruiter may tell you great, apply online. If you've followed the steps listed above and left a good impression - you will now likely have success asking them for their business card/contact information. Apply online and follow their directions and be sure to send them a follow up email/phone call thanking them for their time and reaffirming your interest in the position. Tell them you followed their directions and give them the application ID if provided. 

5) Profit. 

Just my humble advice but it worked wonders for me senior year and it makes even more sense now that I've been on the other side of the table."	t5_2qkxs	True

All of you incoming freshman that have friends coming here with you, make more friends. Freshman year is your time to find friends that will help you and make your time here enjoyable. Champaign-Urbana is a very lonely place unless you know people. When in your dorms try to meet everyone, I have a few friends from that first year in the dorm that I still see (albeit not very frequently) but that I also lived with later on during my undergrad.

More importantly though, make friends in your classes. Freshman year the subject material was a breeze. I had a friend from high school in my major and as my roommate and I did not make enough friends. He ended up changing majors and the course material got harder. Trying to do the work and learn all the material on your own is much harder than working with a group. I made this mistake and only made a few friends, and in doing so struggled a bit towards the end."	t5_2qkxs	True

Dalimey100	50	10	0	"So Rush week is coming up soon, and a good portion of the freshman men in the subreddit are probably curious about the process and which house to choose from. I feel like compiling all this information in one place is a good way to make life easier for all involved. 

I know r/uiuc has a history of being somewhat anti-greek, there are many of us in this sub who could use some help finding the right resources.

To start here’s the list of fraternities in [IFC](http://www.odos.uiuc.edu/greek/scholarship/ifcGrades.asp) (Inter-fraternity Council) and the sororities in the [Panhellenic Council](http://www.odos.uiuc.edu/greek/scholarship/panGrades.asp) 

Some of the larger/ high quality threads are:

* [a recent thread about Rush](http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/x3hpu/rush_week_at_uiuc/) This has a lot of good content on how to go about rushing, how to act, and what to look for to find your ideal house.

* [as an international student is there a risk that it'll be harder for me to get a bid? Or does it differ from fraternity to fraternity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/so138/question_about_greek_life_at_uiuc/)

* While I wasn’t planning on much discussion about sororities, [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/wspwl/question_about_sororities/) has some very honest discussion on rushing a sorority.  TL:DR  Sororities come with a significant financial investment you have to be aware of.

* [This thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/jp8lg/frats_and_sororities/) is comparatively small, but it gives a very general, easy to read guide through the general rush processes of fraterities and sororities.

* If you’ve ever wondered why people joined a fraternity, [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Frat/comments/wp5ei/why_did_you_join_a_fraternity_and_what_was_your/) from /r/Frat should give you a little insight

* Thoughts on rushing as an [incoming Jr. transfer](http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/i3tan/rushing/)

If there are other threads you think should be included, comment and I’ll add them.

Tonight a little before 1:00am my roommate and I were approached across from Hendrick House by a guy on a bike. He said he was with his girlfriend and they ran out of gas and he needed some gas money so he could get back home. He offered his ring in collateral and promised that he would pay us back. I inspected the ring and could tell that it was from a costume store and told him that neither of us had any money. He then explained that there was an ATM just down the street and he wouldn't mind waiting. He was very insistent and we had to be stern with him to get him to leave us alone.

I am 99% sure this was a scam because I was with my roommate last semester when he was scammed the exact same way. A man approached us in the parking lot behind Lumis and told us almost the exact same story. My roommate gave him $20 and the guy took his phone number and promised he would call and meet up with him and pay him back once he got home. Well he never called.

So watch out guys! Also on a side note, both of these guys were probably in their 30's, rather sketchy looking and appeared to be strung out on something, probably trying to get drug money. "	t5_2qkxs	True

&gt;The list of professors who signed their name includes endowed chairs, distinguished professors and fellows from colleges and departments across campus, such as engineering, law, history, English, physics and more.

&gt;Signatories included Nobel Prize laureate Anthony Leggett; former Vice Chancellor for Research Ravi Iyer; English professor and novelist Richard Powers; James Anderson, Gutsgell professor of history of American education; Ian Hobson, Swanlund Chair and Center for Advanced Study professor of music; and Richard Alkire, professor emeritus of chemical engineering and a vice chancellor in the 1990s.""

&gt;""It reflects a widespread feeling that the Urbana campus has unique capabilities that are not easily intermingled in describing the University of Illinois as a single entity. That diminishes the strength of the Urbana campus,"" said Alkire, who was vice chancellor for research and dean of the Graduate College from 1994 to 1999 and still has an active research program.

&gt;We're in the middle of a prairie. People come here from all over the world, looking at many other places to live, and they come here because of the enormous investment in infrastructure for teaching and research and the things the University of Illinois at Urbana does. That's a very unique capability,"" Alkire said.

He is a really light orange and white cat. He is old, thin, has a really unique meow, he is really friendly, and you can probably convince him to let you pet him. He gets crabby sometimes and bites, so just a heads up. If you see him please try and catch him.

1292724126.0	eo54r	Absolutely Ridiculous Bus Ride Home on Suburban Express..	caitymo	46	9	54	"**EDIT: This is a complaint about 1 specific driver. I should clarify that prior to this experience I have never had a bad experience with Suburban Express**

I am currently 2 hrs 20 mins into my bus ride back home from Champaign. Anyone who knows me well knows that by taking out my laptop I am going to endure some serious motion sickness in a few minutes. So why, you may ask, am I taking this risk? Well, this is how badly I wanted to write down my thoughts about the last two and a half hours. I don’t want to forget to include a single minute of it. So let’s start from the beginning. It’s 12:30 pm and as I’m waiting outside of Altgeld hall, two buses pull up. I look at the yellow signs on the sides of the buses and see: Tinley Park, Woodridge, Oakbrook Mall, Chicago Ridge Mall…no Woodfield yet. Us Woodfielders are informed that our bus will be here in a few minutes. Thinking back, this was the first warning sign. But back then, a mere 2.5 hours ago, I just assumed the bus was late just because it must have taken longer to load. Oh past-Cait, you are in for a surprise. You simply have no idea the hilarity that will occur in the next few hours. 
So I haul my suitcase over the bike path and load it under the bus. I’m one of the last passengers to board, and when I hand my ticket to the driver I notice she looks like she came straight out of the Jersey shore. With her long black hair and her Snookie sunglasses, the only thing she was missing was the abhorrently fake tan.  I thought to myself: well, this is a change of pace from the usual Suburban Express bus drivers. This might be the first driver I’ve gotten who’s not a 55 year old man with a white scruffy beard. But, I thought no more of her appearance and took the only seat available: right behind the driver.  The SubEx boys in their bright yellow jackets closed up the storage under the bus, ensuring our luggage would be secure for the next few hours. 

Now I start to get comfortable: I take off my jacket, gloves, and scarf. Usually by the time I get comfy, the bus is moving. But not this time. Not with Snookie behind the wheel. The buses in front of us have started to leave. Snookie opens the door and while motioning towards the bus in front of her yells out to one of the yellow-jacket boys: “Hey! Get him to stop, it’s not moving again!”  She then honks her horn and messes with some levers and buttons. At this point, I’m intrigued. ‘It’s not moving,’ she said. She can’t possibly mean the bus, can she? She must mean that she can’t get something on the dash to work. Surely, I thought, this bus driver knows how to move the bus. I mean, that’s pretty much her job description. Move the bus from one place to the next. She must, I thought, be referring to something else. Oh past-Cait, naïve once again. She *did* mean the bus. She could not figure out how to get the bus to start moving. One of the drivers from the buses in front of us climbs aboard. He was an older man, wearing a horse-jockey hat and a leather jacket. Pretty “boss.” Snookie says to him: “yeah, I don’t know why I can’t get it to move again.” She gets up and gives the Boss the reigns. As soon as the Boss sits down the bus starts to move. Snookie is astonished: “IT’S ROLLING,” she ever so thoughtfully exclaims. He then passes control back to Snookie, but much to her chagrin she can’t get that bus to move on her own. Well, teaching by demonstration didn’t work for the Boss so he tries to explain verbally. I wish I could have heard what he was saying, but with the door open and cars passing by, his words were inaudible. Don’t worry, though. I have come up with my own dialogue:  “Okay Snookie, first you take this lever next to the wheel, and you pull down until you see a big green D on the dashboard. This D is for drive. This is what you will be doing this afternoon: driving. Then, once you see the big D you can use your foot to press down on the gas pedal. The gas pedal, you see, is the thin one on your right...” 

So finally, the Boss seems convinced she has this whole driving thing down and heads back over to his bus. We’re stopped at a red light on Green and Wright. The light turns green and, oh dear, you guessed it: she can’t get the bus to start moving again. It takes her a good 30 seconds to a minute to figure it out, but this time Snookie got that bus moving all on her own. Props to her. We begin moving and then we all hear her navigation system:  “continue for 500 meters, and then turn left.”  If I hadn’t already figured out she had never driven for Suburban Express before, the nav system would have given it away. Not that I’m complaining. Because Snookie needs a nav system. *This* I am sure about.  So off we go, and once we’re on 57-North I am a bit more confident that I would actually make it home before midnight, when our bus would turn back into a pumpkin. For the next hour or so things went smoother. At one point she turned back to those of us in the first few rows and said: “If you guys want the radio on...I couldn’t quite figure out how to work it. But you’re welcome to come up and mess with it if you like.” Oh dear, she can’t even figure out the radio. Interestingly, nobody took her up on the invitation. A few mins later, the Boss even called her up on her cell phone to check on her. I was a bit nervous when she answered it, but she managed to answer with minimal swerving. She proceeded to tell the Boss that she was, in fact, on the highway. All in all, a nice little chat.
Once she was off the phone, I thought I’d try and nod-off. Because surely, I thought, we were in the clear. Oh, past-Cait, once again you are quite naïve. When will you learn? The bus starts to slow, and I wake up from my cat-nap. Snookie gets on the intercom and says, “I’m going to get off the highway and stop at a gas station to get a drink and a snack. We’ll stop for about 10 minutes and you’re all welcome to get off and get a drink too.”  You have got to be kidding me. This is a 3 hour bus ride, do you really need to take a 10 minute pit stop? But, apparently she did, and we pull into a parking lot which she so eloquently describes as: “nice and big.”  She stops the bus and nobody gets off. To which she responds over the intercom, “Is anyone going to get off?” I cannot control my laughter. She honestly seemed surprised. Really, after being in the car for only an hour, none of you want to get off?  Eventually, about 10-15 kids get off the bus. I didn’t count. And neither did Snookie. This, we will see, would be problematic.

After she dismounts, the snickering begins. Students on the bus are talking about how ridiculous this experience has been so far. “What is this, LEX?” I hear one kid ask. A few minutes later, Snookie comes back with a bag of chips and a drink. Kids start coming back onto the bus, and suddenly she realizes her error and looks a bit concerned. “You think everyone’s back?” She asks those of us in the front. Somehow I managed to refrain from laughing in her face, or asking: You mean, you didn’t count how many kids got off?  She looks down the aisle for a bit, straining her eyes, trying to remember (I assume) if the bus was ever at capacity to begin with. She gets on the intercom and asks: “Is everyone who sat next to you back yet?”  To which she receives no response. Apparently this frustrated her, because she added: “Well, you guys are no help.”  She took this silence to mean everyone was on the bus and started to move again. Someone from the back yelled: there’s one more kid coming! So we wait for him to get on. She asks the kid: “Are you the last one?” He responds with a shrug. This shrug gave Snookie the go-ahead to leave. As she starts to turn the bus around in the lot, more yells from the back of the bus indicate more kids were still coming. Snookie then says: “We’ll still turn around and make them think we’re leaving.”  How clever, Snookie. I’m sure your lil prank will get a laugh out of the kids who think they’ll be left behind in Monee, Illinois. She stops driving and the kids come up to the bus, but Snookie doesn’t open the door right away. Instead, she waves at them and starts to drive the bus forward. Hilarious, Snookie! You took your jib of leaving them behind even further. You’d never *actually* leave a kid behind, and that’s why it’s so funny. So the stragglers get on the bus and she starts to leave again. This time, we’re just about to pull out onto the street and head back to the highway when some kids in the back yell: “there’s one more!”  Sure enough, I look out the window, and someone’s running to the bus. He gets on and Snookie laughs and says, “So *you’re* the last one, right?” You’re right, Snookie. This is hilarious: this guy had to run full speed!

It’s still possible we left someone behind. I guess we’ll never know. Since taking the laptop out, we have made it back to Woodfield. But Snookie’s mishaps don’t end at nearly leaving 4 students behind in Monee, Illinois. As we got off of the highway, Snookie proceeded to admit she had no idea where she was going. The nav system will get you to Woodfield Mall, but it won’t get you to lot B4. The kid next to me managed to get her to the lot, but along the way she hit a curb and the whole left half of the bus was up on it for a bit. Snookie shrugged off this 30 second ride on the curb, saying: “I just can’t see the left side of my bus, you know?”  At this point, her words don’t even surprise me. When turning into the lot, three trees scratched the entire right side of the bus. We finally get into the lot, and Snookie is annoyed with all the traffic caused by the holiday shopping. “This is the PITS!” she exclaims. She nudges the bus over to the curb in the back of the lot, and we all piled off. At least a funny story came out of it, right?

But I have also had a great time discovering The Art (which I became a shareholder of for its upcoming conversion to a co-op), and Destihl (the best restaurant I have been to since moving here). Holi was a ton of fun, and I enjoyed the Ellnora guitar festival and many other concerts at Krannert, Canopy, and on campus. And to a person, **every** person I have met through reddit has been great and exceeded my expectations for courtesy and friendliness.

Sorry that I took the extra day, emailing everyone their match took longer than the matching.

Email ruiucsinglesmatchup@gmail.com if you didn't receive an email! Hope nobody fell through the cracks.

I mean, if they are telling you they’re doing blow and heroin on this informal app they’re probably not the girl for me, but I’m not too picky. 

“I'm incredibly attractive”

i have no human children, but several lego people and stuffed animals

[my friends are]Generally nice, smart, and interesting people. This is a dumb question because my friends aren’t carbon clones that I can describe in 50 words.

In other news, I now feel like I have no unique interests any more. This was a really, really fun project, and it was very fulfilling.

Come at 7:30 for food (provided by Silver Mine Subs), music, and fun. We will be giving away gift certificates to a lucky few from incredible restaurants such as Beef Stand, Maize Mexican Grill, and Fat Sandwich. The cost will be $5 per person, but this gets you glowsticks, food, and 1 chance to win a prize. Additional chances to win can be purchased for $2.

1375673968.0	1jpwjg	Anybody interested in adopting a dog?	EmeraldGirl	43	10	9	"Every once in awhile I take in a dog which is up for adoption but has extenuating circumstances which do not make it appropriate for a standard shelter program. Usually, it's something like IV antibiotics or other advanced medical care. Once the dog is done with treatment, we look for a permanent home.

Daisy is a one year old, 40 lbs, lab-based mix. She is tall and small-framed, but she may ""chunk up"" as she gets older. She's crate-trained, housebroken, hasn't destroyed anything in my house, and gets along with my dogs. She is intelligent but very hyper and relatively untrained. She's picked up on our house rules and is learning very quickly, but still has trouble with walking on leash. She would really benefit from the use of an [Easy Walk Harness](http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2751027&amp;lmdn=Dog+Collars%2C+Tags+%26amp%3Bamp%3Bamp%3B+Leashes&amp;f=PAD%2FpsNotAvailInUS%2FNo). She comes with a crate (not in good shape, you will probably want a replacement), leash, and collar.

The backstory: Daisy was living with a couple until they got divorced. The guy kept the house but didn't want a dog. The woman was unable to find an apartment that allowed dogs, so Daisy went to her mother's house. Mother has other dogs, one of whom mauled Daisy. Obviously I wasn't there, but the other dog has serious documented issues and is clearly the aggressor. Daisy has healing scars on her ear, chest/neck, face and lips/gums.

If you're interested in adopting, please let me know about yourself and your living situation via PM. Adopter will be required to provide proof of living situation and sign an adoption agreement.

My name is Lindsay Anderson, and I am very happy to respond to your questions about a possible work action that is being faced by the Graduate Employees' Organization. We represent almost 2,400 teaching assistants and graduate assistants across the campus. You may have heard that we are on the edge of a work action, or strike. 

As many of you already know, [the GEO has passed an authorization vote to go on strike](http://www.news-gazette.com/news/education/2012-11-16/geo-members-take-next-step-toward-strike.html). The state of Illinois requires that an authorization vote is taken before any strike can be declared, but in our organization, this vote does not mean we have declared a strike. Instead, based on our constitution, this vote creates a new committee with the executive power to declare, suspend, or call off a strike.

For those of you who already have a good grasp on the issues but want to know how to get involved, [signing our petition is a great start, even if you're not a member](http://www.change.org/petitions/university-of-illinois-community-and-supporters-help-us-protect-tuition-waivers-for-teaching-assistants-and-graduate-assistants).

This is an AMAA, so please be warned that there are a few topics I cannot speak to:

* The start date of a work action/strike
* Buildings that would be targeted for picket lines
* How long a potential strike could last
* Whether your own graduate instructors will hold or cancel classes
* **Rampart**

I am being helped by a member who is a steward in our union who is using the username ""uiuc_grad."" I don't know if he will be given any flair, but he is working with me to answer questions in a timely fashion. Because this is a new account, I will have to obey the 8 minute cool down in between posts for awhile.

Looking forward to your questions!

--Lindsay Anderson

**Edit:** After conferring with my colleague who is helping me answer questions, it has come to my attention that my responses are very long-winded. I am hoping that you all will find the depth of my answers useful and that's what you came to this AMAA with the expectation of receiving.

**Second edit:** It's 2 pm, and duty calls for me to attend a variety of meetings very soon for which I must prepare. Thanks all who submitted questions and visited! Thanks to those who helped answer questions, as well! Finally, thanks to the mods for letting me host this here! =) Hopefully if I get some time later, I will be able to come back and answer any questions that cropped up. In the mean time, please join the GEO at the Union from 9 am - 1 pm Monday and show your support! =]"	t5_2qkxs	True

This has been a long time coming and thanks to everyone who's been supporting us. We wouldn't be here without you.    

A few days ago we published the latest version of Classwhole with the [most requested feature](http://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/rzjem/check_out_classwholes_new_class_scheduling/c49wuxs) -- same page scheduling.  




Please check it out and let us know what you think. [classwhole.com](http://classwhole.com)  
 
*****

I'm also excited to announce that we've decided to open source our project. We decided that open sourcing the project would be the best way to help improve software for students.  
  
Check it all out on [Github](https://github.com/kryali/classwhole)  
  
Under the hood, we rewrote a great deal of code and it feels better than ever. But of course, there will be bugs. So please [file an issue](https://github.com/kryali/classwhole/issues).  
  
Thanks for your time and patience.

1364588534.0	1b9gsc	This is a big deal: @illinois.edu e-mails going to spam	RadRhino	41	11	12	"From a recent MASSMAIL:

""For the last week some email sent from the campus is being rejected by other Universities and private companies. In order to help us address the issue, please review the information provided here. Additional information can be found by reading the ""Phishing Alert"" news item on the campus and CITES homepage.

In recent weeks there has been an uptick in malicious email attacks that attempt to trick individuals into logging in to malicious websites, thereby collecting their login and password. Some of these ""phishing"" attacks were emails that used University of Illinois branding, lending an air of legitimacy to them.

Unfortunately, the attacks were able to use advanced phishing techniques to trick a number of users into revealing their University account information (NetID and password). These compromised accounts are now being used to send more spam and phishing messages, which is negatively impacting normal email communications that the campus relies upon to conduct business. Because of the increased volume of spam and phishing messages sent to off-campus email addresses (e.g. gmail.com, hotmail.com) from compromised Illinois.edu addresses, certain spam control services around the world have blacklisted all email messages that originate from Illinois.edu email servers. This means that emails sent from an Illinois.edu address to schools and companies using these spam control services will not reach their intended recipients.

Please be aware that the University of Illinois will never ask you to reply to an email to with your password or to update account information through email.

CITES apologizes for the problem and is working on technical solutions to minimize the impact of these phishing scams, but no technical solution is foolproof. It is vital to the University that all university members pay closer attention to potential phishing attacks, particularly fraudulent emails. We are making changes in the email system today that will reduce the impacts of the attacks and will begin to reduce the number of external sites that are blocking university email.

For additional information on recognizing phishing emails, what CITES is doing to address this problem and how that might affect your use of email, please visit the campus home page or the CITES website for detailed information.

Thank you,
Greg Gulick and Mike Corn""

He'd sleep in the lab, libraries, Union, and nobody would ever question him because he looked like just another student napping.

I want to say he was an Aerospace student, according to the story, but my memory of it is too fuzzy to know for sure.

My first night I got wasted and ended up hanging out with a group of people that I thought included the guy who lived next to me. In fact I approached these people because I recognized this guy. Next day at the convocation lunch I asked him about the previous nights' shenanigans and he informed me he hadn't the slightest clue as he had stayed in all night. My confusion was only abated when he informed me he had a twin...Only I found out later that day his twin had never met me either. Turns out I inserted myself into this group on a drunken mistake. That group came to be my closet group of friends. Crazy how life works. I know that story was pretty lame but does anyone have any good stories?	t5_2qkxs	True

1368923791.0	1elt6m	Another horrible Suburban Express experience and contact with the lovely Mr. Dennis Toeppen	cmulreed	43	10	46	"You guys are probably sick of these but Suburban was so rude and disrespectful that I cannot help but share this.  I was going home from school using suburban express, a bus leaving at 11 AM traveling to O'hare.  I was planning on printing my ticket out as I usually do, but, my friend who was riding with me said that he had shown the ticket on his phone before and it had not been a problem, so I didn't think twice about it.  Upon arriving to the bus and trying to board the guy checking the tickets rejected us, giving us no options for how to fix the situation except for raising his voice, arguing, and using profane language.  Eventually he threatened to not let me on the bus at all.  I ran back to my place, printed the ticket and was eventually let on the bus after some bad attitude from the bus ticket collector, some college age hot shot that thought he could mess around with customers.  Upset with my service I sent a letter to Suburban recommending that the employee be fired for his outrageous behavior.  

In response, I got a message from Suburban a few days later with the following: ""Hey Chris, In light of your letter, we are going to recommend that you find another mode of transportation between O'Hare and Champaign-Urbana. The situation you describe is entirely of your making. There is absolutely no chance we are going to fire the employee who you dealt with. Unlike you, he is a wonderful person.Regards,Suburban Express""

Obviously disgusted I replied with the following:
""Suburban Express,Thank you for your unhelpful and disrespectful response.  As suggested in the letter, I will be following up with the entire fraternity and sorority community with every intention of taking away from your business.  Respect and accountability could have resolved this issue, however, as I guess should've been expected from a company with your reputation, you took the low road.  Good luck and I hope that being sarcastic and disrespectful to customers gets you past the minimum wage bus company customer service job that you are currently working.Respectfully,Chris""

After this, I got an email from everyone's favorite bus company Dennis Toeppen, himself: 
""Hey Chris,Here are a few things you need to know about your situation:
1) The employee you dealt with is an extremely calm person. We have never witnessed him using profanity, even outside of work.
2) Witness account of your situation suggest that you are in fact the one who was doing the swearing.
3) You were told that, based on your behavior, that you would not be permitted to ride again.
4) You then went away and returned wearing sunglasses and perhaps a hat, in order to disguise your identity.
We plan to make a web page for this situation, to help reasonable people understand the garbage we have to tolerate from a small percentage of our customers. The url will be www.bigbus.com/chrismulreed.
Best Wishes,
Suburban Express""

The name in the URL is my name, something that Mr. Toeppen apparently thought would scare or offend me.  I do not care.  I replied:
""Mr. Toeppen,
Here are a few things you need to know about your situation:
1)  This employee argued with me and I can promise you that he is in no way a calm person.
2)  I also have witness account, a friend of mine who was also riding, who could happily tell you that the swearing was from both parties.
3)  The fact that the employee even suggested this is crazy and shows your lack of care for your customers.
4)  I in no way attempted to disguise my identity, I came back wearing the exact same outfit, no hat and sunglasses resting on top of my head, just as I had left the bus.  I made no attempt to pretend I was someone else and it was mutually understood that I was the person who was returning.
I hope you do make your website as it will only further illustrate your intentions to antagonize your loyal customers.  As I mentioned in my letter, I have ridden Suburban Express many other times and been happy but your employee's actions this time were unacceptable.  I know you think you are a hot shot and that you can try to bully your customers, but it is going to come back to bite you.  It is clear that bad business practices stem from the top at Suburban Express.  I will be going through numerous channels in order to make sure that this situation is resolved justly, something that obviously will not happen by continuing to deal with Suburban Express.
Regards,
Chris Mulreed""

He sent me two straight emails after that before blocking me from sending him anything:
""You sent us a threat. We will defend ourselves accordingly.
Have a nice weekend.""
and
""It's online, Chris. At this point, you are the only one who knows the URL. We are collecting affidavits from the employee you have lied about and from the two witnesses we have to your behavior. What happens next is up to you.
http://www.suburbanexpress.com/chrismulreed/""

Dennis Toeppen is a scumbag and a crook and has once again not learned his lesson and continued to try bullying his customers.  He doesn't scare anyone and I thought you guys might like to see the outrageous things he is willing to say to his customers.
