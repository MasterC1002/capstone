Now he's been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia! What more can I do to help?	LinT5292	35	5	9	"[My post on /r/shittyadvice wasn't very helpful](http://www.reddit.com/r/shittyadvice/comments/1ebsl7/my_neighbors_been_depressed_recently_so_i_hid/), so I thought I'd ask some medical professionals about this:

So a few months ago, my neighbor was diagnosed with depression, and I wanted to help him through it, but I didn't know how to ask him, so I just put some cameras and microphones throughout his house to watch over him, and added some speakers to talk to him and give him advice.

First, I wanted to inform him of what I was doing, so I said, ""I'm watching you, Steven."" He was a little scared by suddenly hearing a voice talking to him, so I tried to calm him down. I said, ""I'll always be watching you, Steven. It's for your own good."" Since then, I've been sure to give him helpful bits of advice or just keep a running commentary about what he's doing throughout the day in order to make sure he knows I'm still there for him.

I guess his mental condition started getting worse, because I was reading through his search history, and he's been looking up information about psychiatrists specializing in psychosis.

After opening and reading through his mail like I do every day, I found out that now he's been diagnosed with schizophrenia! Apparently he's been experiencing paranoid delusions and auditory hallucinations, and never even told me about it (don't worry, I made sure to tell him I was upset with him).

So now I need some advice. I keep assuring him that I'll always be here watching him no matter what, but for some reason that just seems to make him more upset. What more can I do to help improve his mental health?"	t5_2t74y	True

It was really bad for one day but since then, it has subsided.  It's not explosive but it's kind of watery (not very, it still has some thickness but its much softer than my usual bowel movement).  Today, I just noticed that I have a small rash on my left arm.  I also was displaying a rush thrush (I don't brush my teeth......often...lol).  I'm worried that these symptoms may be HIV.  

My last sexual encounter was unprotected sex with a male.  Then after that, I did a lot of yard work around my house and some of the stuff I may have encountered may have been poisen ivy.  Also, it could be a stomach.  I have no clue but I am worried and stressing myself over the possibility that I might have HIV.  Should I get an HIV test kit from CVS?

Pt is a 40 y/o male. He is completely unresponsive and since his arrival to my ED he has fallen into a comatose state. BP 100/50, HR 60 and week, RR 10 br/min shallow and bilateral gurgling. Pt also shows signs of productive exhalation, creating a kind of liquid in the oropharynx. 

The pt also exhibits pretty severe jaundice (which would indicate liver damage) as well as edema swelling all over his body. [Here](http://www.likeablequotes.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/homer-sleep.jpg) is a picture of the pt in his current state.

2. No phobia of swarms of the aforementioned that would prevent you from keeping calm in their presence
3. Your home must be capable of preventing the escape of winged insects
4. You must live in the continental United States, as certain shipping regulations would hinder the delivery of live materials necessary for the clinical trial

**Compensation** (what you get if you complete the trial):

1. One of [these](http://i.imgur.com/QWCNo.jpg)
2. Six month subscription to my newsletter (a $400,000 value!)

I recently had the honor of joining Shitty Doctors Without Borders, an organization of shitty doctors who travel to third and fourth world countries to help populations in need. This most recent trip brought me to a part of the globe called Le Pays Maudit. Once there, I was immediately led to a village where I saw the illness right away. 

The entire village was being quarentined for this epidemic. The other people in the area called the sick ""Smurfs"". I have never seen anything like it. Some of the signs/symptoms included a reversal of HGH by the endocrine system, severe hypoxia causing cyanotic skin, and epiglotitis which affected the way they all spoke. The ""smurfing"" of the villages also had an incredibly high mortality rate for women.  [Here](http://cdn2.holytaco.com/wp-content/uploads/images/2009/12/smurfs-main.jpg) is a picture I took of them.

1330017229.0	q2pet	Anxiety Issues.  Psychiatry help!?	isuckwithusernames	4	2	9	"So I have been self medicating since anxiety problems became an issue in high school (I didn't know it was anxiety for a couple of years).  I know that probably wasn't the best idea.  In fact, it most definitely wasn't the best idea and I wish I had went to see a psychiatrist when my anxiety started.  However, here I am, applying for jobs where they have extensive background and drug tests. I can't continue to smoke weed or buy anti-anxiety illegally so my question is how should I go about trying to get a psychiatrist (I don't have one yet) to prescribe me something for anxiety? More specifically, I obviously can't say that I take xanax and smoke weed (a lot)... but should I say that I have taken xanax ever? Or that I've taken it once and it helped? Should I mention weed at all?  I realize that withholding information from my psychiatrist will prevent me from a completely effective treatment, but I have been self-medicating for 6 years and know what works and what doesnt work for me.  Please don't say ""stop smoking"" or ""weed causes anxiety"" or ""drugs are bad mmkay"" because I know these things and would rather be able to take something consistantly that I know works than go through periods of stronger drug use followed by nothing.  That only makes the craving for drugs of any kind stronger. and I can't stay in college forever (unfortunately).

1338943501.0	un2au	Alcohol intolerance or something else? Who can solve the puzzle that is my life currently!	thalff	3	3	3	"Shitty doctors of Reddit, 
I am a relatively healthy 21 year old male. About two months ago I started to feel a little nauseous after just starting to drink (maybe a beer or two in). Around a month ago I had maybe 4 drinks and got quite ill, feeling lightheaded and throwing up multiple times. Finally, a week ago I had a beer and a half at a bar--- surprise surprise, I felt light headed, nauseous and my stomach was very upset. 

Just looking at that information I would guess that I have an intolerance to alcohol but, the story thickens! 

My stomach remained upset for around a week after the recent beer experience and I found that my appetite was almost completely gone. When I did eat I couldn't stop burping and my stomach would get upset rather quickly. 

So Reddit, what is the matter with me! Do I have an intolerance to alcohol, gastritis or some other disease? As a Type 1 Diabetic I am really hoping it isn't an intolerance to alcohol, I feel like I already do my fair share of sacrificing! 

Thanks again!   "	t5_2t74y	True
