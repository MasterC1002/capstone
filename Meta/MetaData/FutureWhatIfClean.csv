In my imagination, I invision people coming back though a portal, dirtied, out of breath and desperate looking; maybe even falling through and landing face down (as if falling though a doorway).  They all appear within close proximity to a direct ancestor who lives now (grand or great grandparent).  

They all come telling of the same story, of governments falling, cities burning, people dying, environmental destruction. They bring with them indisputable documentation of their claims and futuristic technology that we (the present humanity) will have decades or centuries to learn about and improve upon to defend ourselves from an invasion some day in the future.  History for the future people is devastated with technologies suddenly jumping forward decades/centuries and in ways that current society may not be prepared for (think of what it would be like if you handed someone from the 1800's a smartphone).

And if we responded, it wouldn't reach them for 50,000 years, possibly after both their civilization and ours were long gone. 

It's also a safe assumption that we would be unable to translate this message, since we have no points of reference to do so, and no information about the alien society to help us guess what it could mean.

1367243629.0	1dc5fb	I created a hypothetical world map for the year 2100. Create a story!	mr_wiggin	81	20	70	"[Here's the map!](http://i.imgur.com/CPIsN0F.png)

I decided to rely heavily on what I know about current political unions, and upcoming unions.


In Asia, I imagine that Russia has balkanized due to rampant corruption and political in-fighting, with a fundamentalist Christian state forming around the Ural Mountains. China has lost some territory after the DPRK collapses, and Japan regained some of its former Empire. Earlier in the century, Mongolia discovered a treasure trove of mineral resources which jump started its economy. A South East Asian Union (ASEAN) emerges in response to China's territoriality. After a brief nuclear exchange in the 2030's, India claims Pakistan as part of its territory. Bangladesh unionizes with India after it receives heavy aid as a result of dramatic climate change ravaging the country.


In the Middle East, Iran remains the same geographically despite having gone through major social and political reform in the 2020's.The Central Asian Block is formed after Russia collapses, in response to political pressure from all sides. After decades of religious turmoil and sectarian violence, and partly in response to a dramatically more powerful Turkish Union, a Caliphate is created to run a Pan-Arabic Union. It started with the countries of the Arabic Peninsula, and slowly spreads through North Africa, and the rest of the Levant.

The EU has finally federalized after adding a few more countries and sorting out the financial crisis earlier in the century. The Scandinavian  Union forms purely due to their unique liberal social policies.

The East African Federation is formed in 2018. In the rest of Africa, after years of steady economic development and Chinese aid, other Unions are formed: The (Christian) Nigerian States of West Africa, and Greater South Africa.

In the Americas, South America federalized fairly early in the century, and has remained a prominent global power since. In response, the Caribbean States of America are formed out of Central America and the Caribbean. Mexico, over the years has seriously developed economically; even rivaling the United States and Canada. As a gesture of goodwill, and due to changing ethnic backgrounds of the American Southwest, Southern California (south of LA), Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas are ceded to Mexico.

Not really sure if this is allowed but hell, its not like this sub has a lot of clearly defined rules. Instead, it's more or less regulated by its users, and thankfully the user base of the subreddit is amazing. Y'all are chill, relaxed, and willing to answer questions without trolling. Or at least most of the time. 


I honestly believe that this subreddit has one of the better communities, and because of that is one of the better subreddits, despite the lack of moderation, which is also a good thing. We don't want to be as uptight as /r/askhistorians, that IMO will turn people away. 

Anyway, this sub is good, the community is good, but the activity is not. 


We just need more people posting, more people browsing and answering questions, more people not lurking. At the time of this writing there are 3 users here now and 8,280 subscribers. 


I honestly don't know how to draw users in, but try to get your friends to subscribe or something. I don't know. Refer people from /r/Askreddit or /r/historicalwhatif or /r/askhistorians if their posts will fit into this sub. 


More activity will be a good thing, as long as its not of the wrong kind. No one wants euphoric teenage atheist neckbeards trolling.

It involves no collaborators to betray you or provide traceable communication. Planning (acquire gun &amp; ammunition, pick target) are activities with innocent explanations. It's hard to prove that a hunter or a mall shopper is planning a shooting spree attack. Someone messing around in the woods with explosives is a different matter.

What if Al Qaeda/Islamic fundamentalism stops focusing on ""complicated"" plots involving bombs and hijackings and instead urges folks on the path to radicalization to focus on much simpler ""mall shooter"" attacks.

The [2009 Fort Hood Shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Hood_shooting) killed 13 and injured 30. The [1993 CIA Headquarters Shooting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_shootings_at_CIA_Headquarters) killed 2 and injured 5.

The fact that such attacks are somewhat ""idiot proof"" (most attacks would result in at least some deaths) might make them appeal to a wider pool of potential jihadists. Let's assume that these attacks thus become very popular (several per week) and the ""terrorist attack"" rate increases while the ""terrorist plot detection rate"" plummets.

Samalamalam	58	7	114	"So, let's say that the US military has received a bunch of reports suggesting that within a few decades the most efficient form of military intervention will be in the form of small, elite infantry units with exceptionally expensive equipment. Furthermore, they predict that the demand for military intervention to protect US interests will increase *and* the quality of recruits available is falling due to fewer people joining the military and society in general becoming less physically and psychologically fit for combat.

The pentagon considers the situation and then finally decides to assign massive amounts of funding towards research into how they could create the very best infantry units that they possibly can. They decide to re-make the entire US army into a super-infantry force, scrapping all heavy armour and artillery units (or transferring them to the USMC).

What kind of super-soldiers are they likely to be able to get? Assume fairly 'realistic' advances in technology and social and legal restrictions on what you can reasonably do to human beings (so no raising people to fight from birth, no 90% casualty rates from training, et cetera) and no breakthroughs which allow non-humans (robots, engineered animals, synthetic lifeforms) to completely replace humans in the infantry role.

What if the goal is to have a battlefield where the only expected role for the human warfighter in theater is to sign the instruments of surrender?

Assume that every weapon the opposing force attempts to use is neutralized convincingly using autonomous swimming/flying/walking/driving robots. Tanks? Destroyed by disposable tank-killing kamikaze drones. Men with guns? Insect sized sensor robots report them and bird sized UAVs attack with serious but nonlethal force, anyone carrying a gun or operating a weapon ends up in a hospital. Warships and attack boats? Please meet the fleet of thousands of robot boats and subs. Fighters and bombers get immediately spotted and attacked by swarms of 24h patrolling robot planes. All this kit ends up being much cheaper than an Iraq or Afghanistan type war because friendly lives *aren't* at stake with the robots. No more exotic [$678m planes,](http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/12/f-22-real-cost/) instead the US churns them out and let ""quantity have a quality of its own.""

How would this change how wars are fought? Would (say) the US be more gung-ho about tackling thorny geopolitical problems such as North Korea?

Edit: to make it more plausible/interesting, lets say the US justifies autonomous robot warfare by promising *and delivering* very few enemy deaths. The robots are almost exclusively anti-materiel, sinking ships but delivering life jackets and providing lifeboats, disabling tanks by blowing the tracks off, attacking infantrymen by attaching to their rifles and counting down from 10 in Farsi, planes get attacked by engine ingestion allowing crash landing/ejection."	t5_2v3da	True

Patterns are made by putting something into the machine to be scanned (cook a steak, scan it, and you can endlessly replicate the same steak). Patterns can be shared over the internet.

Replicators can. of course, replicate themselves, so they are inexpensive enough that everyone can get one. Items larger than the replicator can be made n pieces and attached together.

Eventually, it reaches the 75% of the states legislatures required to approve it and Congress reluctantly ratifies the amendment.

**I'm asking what this could imply - how this data could be used etc. What do you think ?** (&lt;- tl;dr)

----

**Further explanation**: computer games/virtual realities are getting enhanced day after day. Just look at the development of games in 10years and now think further (maybe 50years) and the rather exponentional rate of this development. We will have virtual realities that are close to actual reality without a doubt. Now what if people could monitor all your psychological reactions there ? There are many ways how this could be done but I'm more speaking of the game just coming with that inbuilt. It could forward every input from the user that it gets; and virtual realities get more and more input. By now for some inputs games have is where you look with the mouse etc.  
As written I actually thought about this when playing Far Cry 3 and there was a mission in which there was a guy (whose business you plan to infiltrate) explaining his global product (could be seen as Far Cry 3 the game) and that there is a camera in the characters' eyes (you the player, you then needed to slaughter your friend because he saw what you saw and you needed to trick him).

And as writing I thought about one implication: what if virtual realities become so used and so complex&amp;detailed [eventually even merging with reality ingame much like in [""Surrogates""](https://youtube.com/watch?v=UGwQ74cH5O0)] that people spend most of their time in them and the analysation of the data is done by AI. Eventually this AI even could initiate specific reactions/situations in the game and find ways to change your reactions, or find people that are more likely to be violent, etc...... and much more - that another huge ton of implications.

-The first commercial models will be ungodly expensive, and major capital investments for the industries that are early adopters (shipping, transport, etc.); but those costs will fall along the same lines as most commercial electronics, and eventually they'll be a common feature of most homes.

-The energy costs associated are not only not prohibitive, but favorable...  Beaming wouldn't be cheaper than driving across town, but over any distance over 100 miles or so, it's more energy efficient than internal combustion travel.

-The technology comes about because a new, public, breakthrough in the scientific community, not because of the private brainstorm of someone working R&amp;D at Xerox or Google...  Meaning, monopolists aren't an issue...

Let's say for the sake of an alternate and less extreme scenario that any missile defense systems that the US has in place fail to completely neutralize the bomb but are able to weaken it or lessen the impact somehow by altering the course to just outside a suburb west of Atlanta.

Caveats:
    
    1. No one would ever be able to have kids. If everybody suddenly became immortal but retained the ability to procreate, humanity would reach critical mass in about 3-4 days.
    
    2. You would be able to end your own life if you chose to.
    
    3. You would stay the same age you are now.
    
    4. The exception to 3 would be people under ~25, who would continue to develop normally until the age of their choosing. (the logic behind this being that the brain usually doesn't fully develop in terms of hormones, decision-making, etc. until someone's mid-20s.)
    
    5. You would lose any sort of potentially lethal disease or recurring painful condition - e.g. Parkinson's, shingles, cancer, arthritis, osteoporosis, HIV, AIDS, etc.
    
    6. You would still be able to feel pain from physical injury, but would not be able to die from any sort of trauma, e.g. if someone was in a natural disaster or terrorist attack or anything that would cause their body to be vaporized or crushed or burned, they would feel immense pain but the body would not degrade.

If boring technology were improved slightly, and this technology were placed on an oil rig like installation, in theory it might be possible to created a man-made underwater volcano. Obviously there would be other technical hurdles to overcome, such as insulating the magma as it rises through the borehole and water, and directing it as it as it exits above the water surface.

""was Watching the movie 28 weeks later gave me the idea about sovereignty with a suddenly significantly smaller population.

Question: Say Great Britain or Honshu (the islands of the UK/Japan with the vast majority of the population) were to have their populations suddenly reduced to percentage points of their present amount or completely wiped out (without affecting anything else) how would this affect:

•	Sovereignty

Would the smaller islands (by population) that also form the countries be able to retain their right to the govern that area / how would the international community react to the smaller government of these countries, would they be supportive?

•	Assets

what would happen to the countries vast assets? everything from vehicles to high end electronics would be easy to come by in these countries, would an industry form out of collecting and selling things of value like this? also, would international companies retain their rights over assets held within the country (stock, etc.)

•	Production capability

would things like oil refineries and any other examples of internationally important facilities come under temporary management (importing workers / resources) until other countries can build to fill the demand left by the loss of their production capabilities

•	Militarily

how would the assets of their respective military s be handled especially navies (and especially in regards to the UK) I'm assuming navies would be largely unaffected by the disaster as they are ships and therefore weren't infected, how would such a large military force for such a small number of people conduct itself, would ships be sold or would they defer to allied control to retain functionality?

•	please note: I know that a biological reason for wiping out the population would lead to quarantine / rotting bodies etc. so can we try to work around that in order to give us an essentially abandoned Island civilisation, maybe the government had already initiated quarantine procedures, started burning bodies / set up facilities outside of population centres or anything like that leading to a situation where biological hazards within the towns and cities are minimal for those coming after the event""

[Political World in 2057](http://i.imgur.com/5tVwk7L.jpg)


**2014** – Scottish Independence is defeat at the polls.


**2020's** – United Kingdom hold referendum about staying in the EU. Euro-sceptic Conservatives along with UKIP MP's manage to sway the vote against and UK leaves the EU.


**2030's** – British Government establish better trade within the Commonwealth of Nations.


**2045** – Argus Industries based in London unveil a new product. A small scale Thorium Nuclear Reactor. About the size of a semi-truck it can power whole cities. London suddenly becomes awash with money. They have clean, cheap power everyone wants.


**2045 to 2046** – Over the next 18 months oil prices plummet as hundreds of Thorium Reactors roll off the assembly lines into India, South Africa, Canada and Australia as the “Commonwealth Conservative” government with UKIP backing grant charters to their Commonwealth friends. The USA is left out in the cold. The US had had her problems over the years with wars in the middle east and other areas, but the fact that all oil was traded in US dollars let her expand like no other nation in history. What the British did though just about destroyed the USA. Within 18 months the price of oil had dropped to a shadow of its former self. That was when the problems began... for everyone. Massive lay off began in the oil sector and went through to the automotive, coal and other sectors of the economy like wildfire. 


**Oct 16 2046** – The US dollar drops 50% in one day causing the US to fall into a depression.


**2046 to 2047** – With the US in a depression the rest of the world economy begins to collapse. Riots, depressions, bush wars and chaos spreads worldwide as airlines, freight, railways and even cities begin to shut down. People can't get paid, pensions or savings. World trade grinds to a halt.


**2047** – China goes into a full revolution. Few news breaches the Silk Curtain as the Politburo try to suppress the revolution and show the world everything is fine. In reality dark and horrific rumours come out from behind the Silk Curtain. Things like human meat being cheaper than pork. Russia is facing the same problems as their economy was propped up on oil and gas exports. 


**2046 – 2050** Many other countries are suffering riots, food problems that last for years. Most of Africa goes dark. South America is awash in political and guerilla groups. Weapons become cheap as the Russia and US have fire sales in desperate attempts to shore up their economies. 


**2051** – The US enters a Second Civil War as the states west of the Rocky Mountains secede from the Federal Government and establish their own country of Pacifica. The southern “Confederate” states secede later in the year forming the Confederate States of America. Britain is sending some aid along with some other countries but it will be years before the US is whole again. Britain is offering citizenship to the rich, the tech gurus and like rats leaving a sinking ship the best and brightest are now fleeing to Britain.


**2052** – The Commonwealth of Nations holds a trade summit in Ottawa, Canada. They decide they are the only ones left with any muscle left to try and jump start a world economy. The US is in a three way fight to reclaim their lands. Russia is broke and China is trying to put down a rebellion. They decide to form a political and economical union after much debate and negotiations. The Commonwealth of Nations is born as a political/economical entity. Each member state will have control over domestic affairs and a Commonwealth Parliament will have control over defence, trade and foreign policy. Canada, Australia, India, New Zealand, South Africa, UK, Singapore form the core nations. They form a single currency union unsurprisingly called the Pound and remove trade barriers between countries of the Commonwealth. 


**2053 to 2057** – The Commonwealth of Nations hold originally seemed to be tenuous as there was political and cultural differences between the core nations. After a transition period it begins to settle and the Commonwealth Parliament decides to impose order on other member states of the Commonwealth who haven't officially signed up to the new Parliament. Bolstered by recruits from the Indian sub continent, Africa and Australia the Commonwealth Army begins to move into other southern African nations with the goal of stabilizing them and integrating them into the Commonwealth. It's navy is reminiscent of the old Royal Navy with the Commonwealth disregarding all restrictions on shipbuilding as it claims it hasn't negotiated these treaties. Most of the South American countries band together to protect their mutual interests from Westerners who would exploit them. China having sorted their internal problems begins to expand across South East   Asia trying to secure resources for themselves. Russia expands into middle Asia to try and stop Chinese power growing on their borders and to strengthen their armies, decimated in suppressing revolts, against the European Union. Lead by France and Germany the European Union weathered the “Dark Years” better than most other powers eventually became the political bloc it was long expected to become.


**2057 on wards** – The Great Game begins as the Commonwealth tries to combat Chinese expansion in South East Asia. Prevent the US from becoming united again and trying to sway African leaders away from other world powers such as the EU, Russian Federation, the Chinese and the South American Alliance.

I was recently talking with a friend, who mentioned watching a documentary (though he failed to mention the name, so if anyone knows it please reply!) about Time Travel. He pointed out one of the theories he found most interesting.

This form of time travel can only be used from the moment it is created to the moment it ends. Traveling into your past is *not* something you can do, unless your past falls between those two points. 

I found it amusing, because if that were to happen, the idea of time would suddenly take on a whole new meaning. If you were able to travel to any point in time--to be at any single time at any time in your life, what impacts would that have on an individual? What impacts would it have on society?

What about crime? If a murder happens, just go back to right before it happens, and stop the killer before he has time to commit the crime. The same goes for accidents. Things would change so drastically. 

I thought it would be interesting to discuss...so, what do you guys think?

BeeNukem	12	8	5	"The write-up that follows was submitted by myself to the worldbuilding subreddit recently, and I figured you all might have a few words of wisdom concerning its potentiality. Please, if you could, let a poor sinner know. Akatosh will reward your generosity.

""Greetings fellow architects, builders, scoundrels, and scallywags. I’ve long since joining this sub considered when the right time would be to submit my creation for the ogling eyes of the community to critique and consider, but have since come to the conclusion that well, fuck it all, the time is now you little bitch. So posthaste, I submit to you a world so hot off the iron presses, it could very well sear your fingertips right off.

I’ll preface her with a bit of background. Earth: 2043. The planet’s oil supply has essentially been run dry. The once great nations of man have been brought to their knees by a societal collapse, incomparable. Survivors exist solely on the merciful conditions of their surroundings, salvaging Old World remnants and toiling in basic industry, while fending off the ruthless nature of their new world. As in any state of crisis, there are those who take advantage of the misfortunes of collapsing regulation. Inhabiting the crumbling metropolic forests once home to the bustling traffic and towering corporations of a doomed society, the lawless are those very individuals who bask in the plight of their fellow man, seizing and claiming both property and life as they see fit. But that’s not the only threat to safety here in the naughty 40’s, Ace. It may be marginally difficult, but totally possible, to avoid death-by-looter. Something you can’t outrun, however, is a red-hot powerhouse of celestial rock screaming through the sky, with its crosshairs aimed at your oblivious existence. If you asked Larry Flannigan of the New Redford Township, he would agree. Although, in a wild galactic game of whack-a-mole, Larry was implanted into his moderately-profitable corn field several miles out of town, so he may be a little out-of-touch. 

Raining meteorites have become a highly common danger among the slew of threats around the globe. Having been dispatched from their motherly orbit in large quantity, they have attained a high standard of value in the currency of trade that replaced the previously broken system of dollars, yen, and the like. As ominous as the possibility of being squashed by a boulder may be, even more so is meeting eyes with its mother in the night’s sky, watching as it slides gently around the planet, both leading and following a trail of its children in parade. This was no act of God, though. No. This was a plague brought about by the greed and desperation of man. Seeking to extract a heaven-sent source of limitless power from within, a mining operation was begun and the behemoth engaged, coaxed into a near-orbit of Earth. As with any mission of this magnitude, however, there was a slim chance of failure - that the drilling could rupture the crusted shell coating its crystalline core. And it did.

This caused widespread panic and disorder, and sent the modern structure of human society rolling down a muddy hill, hitting every stone and thorny bush on its way toward the sloppy bottom. Some of those who survived the fall have held some vision of order together in forms of village refuges, townships, and community alliances. Others who prefer to live alone have taken to forests, bayous, hotels, and all sorts of other imaginative retreats to make living a bit more manageable. This sort of variation may just be the only way to outlive the bind long enough to have a chance at rebuilding what was once taken for granted. But this is life. This is the New Earth. ""

BigKev47	7	2	14	"It won't happen, obviously, because they'd never ratify the necessary amendment..  but it seems to me that if this suddenly happened, the under-represented states that would be trying to secede would be in control of a large amount of the food supply; an awful lot of territory (including so crucial airspace of there were a NY/LA alliance), and a significant amount of US military material..  Most nuclear silos are not in states with lots of elector votes...

So how would it go?  And give details!!  Chicago is obviously the big geographic disparity... would it be a battleground, or would Rahm declare a separate peace with his bellicose redneck neighbors?  The international community would likely support the NY/LA axis, but don't they buy a lot of shit made in Nebraska, too?

Plus, there's the ""Last Resort"" aspect... how useful or all the nuke silos in the middle of nowhere? And would the navy automatically fall into allegiance with the coast, because of Norfolk/San Diego, or would individual captains choose their own sides?

Was told that /r/HistoricalWhatIf would be more appropriate. Then I was informed there that you guys would be more appropriate lol so let me see if I can finally get some feedback on this  :)

Anyways, I've been toying around with a possible novel about kind of near future setting, and in this novel I'm basically writing it in a ""post-America"" setting. I'm trying to have a setting that's also post-WWIII where an attack on America was the catalyst for that and the eventual outcome being the United States left in a 3rd world state.

So I was just wondering if you could use your historical knowledge to consider how events would unfold if some group that opposed the US (whether it terrorist or other nation) managed to sneak bombs into the white house, congress building, and the supreme court building and essentially took out everyone inside. I would imagine it to basically leave the US government in a very bad way and would probably lead to the military stepping in to try and maintain the social peace in a state of marshal law for awhile. 

Anyways, I would rather here your thoughts on this hypothetical.

The scenario he suggested: Should the South Korean presidential election which is happening this year pick someone who is not as interested in maintaining the SK-US alliance, SK might consider strengthening the SK-China relationship out of pragmatic concerns. I'm not too sure that this is even remotely likely, but I'm willing to entertain the idea since the guy might have a different perspective.

So yeah. **What would happen if South Korea decides to like China more than America?** I'm not too well-versed in history, military, world affairs, etc. to imagine concretely what would happen.

Some things he predicted:
* The US will not be able to cast military presence in the Southeast Asia without a major ally in East Asia.
* Sinosphere will rise as a power bloc and make the East vs. West dichotomy explicit.
* The relationship between Japan and the US will strengthen.

Some things I imagine will happen:
* The relationship between North Korea and South Korea might shift to a less hostile tone, though I can't pick to what degree.
* South Korea will have to go through a social transformation, if it wishes to discard the anti-communist attitude it fostered for the last half a century. There probably will be political discord!

Summary:

&gt;To date, humanity has not made any form of contact with extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI). But we cannot rule out the possibility that one or more ETI exist in our galaxy, or that we could detect, communicate with, or in other ways have contact with them in the future. There have been many analyses of how contact would proceed, but these tend to focus narrowly on one possible contact scenario. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the broad range of possible ETI contact scenarios in terms of whether the contact would benefit or harm humanity. Such scenario analysis helps train our minds to recognize patterns in actual outcomes, which can be valuable in the event of an encounter.

Now lets say a weapon is invented that completely upsets the balance: ie, a weapon that nuetrializes a counterattack.

Scenario:

2022: Tensions escalate between Japan, South Korea and China. The Chinese military becomes more beligerent.

June 22, 2023: DARPA launches a new black project missile defense program.

September 30, 2030: Scientists sucsessfully demonstrate a revolutionary new missile defense system at Groom Lake. Using batteries of laser cannons, particle beam weaponry and railguns, they sucsessfully intercept five ICBMs launched from Kwajelin Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. The test system is named SHILD, or Super High Intercontinental Laser Defense.

2031: Further tests of SHILD continue. A SHILD rapid-fire laser cannon mounted on a nuclear submarine sucsessfully intercepts another ICBM fired from Kwaj, this time during the boost phase. SHILD is readied for full deployment, but remains a black project. The Chinese military becomes very suspicious of the missile tests, but cannot discover the sources of the intercepts. Rumors fly around the world of a new American superweapon. The US government denies all existence of the program, although evidence starts to mount of SHILD's existence.

June 16, 2033: SHILD becomes fully operational, with hidden batteries installed along the West Coast, Alaska, Hawaii, and American bases abroad.

July 22, 2033, 1100 zulu: Japan and China, finally reaching their breaking point, go to war over the Senkaku/Dioyu Islands, kicking off a major war. The situation quickly escalates. USAF satellite recon indicates that the Chinese nuclear force is mobilizing, and intercepted transmissions indicate that they are preparing to attack Japan, South Korea, the Phillipines, and Australia with nuclear missiles. The President conveys an emergency meeting with his senior advisers and military leaders. The Chairman of the Joint Cheifs of Staff informs them that the SHILD system has a very high probability of intercepting a Chinese missile attack, and American casualties would be minimal. The reality sets in: The US would be able to attack China with a full blown nuclear strike without fear of retaliation.

July 22, 2033, 1350 zulu: The President and his advisers retreat to  a secured bunker in the Cheyenne mountain complex. The SHILD system is energized, and the American nuclear force is out on DEFCON 1.

What if they are a little farther ahead than they're letting on? What if there's something to know about *safely* warping spacetime that we haven't thought of? 

Imagine for a second, that a warp field compressing spacetime compress the matter within that field. What if there are other forms of matter that are non-interactive with regular matter, eg WIMPs or some other form of dark matter. Something that we wouldn't discover for another 100 years. The warp field goes on, compressing spacetime and an unknown quantity of dark matter, inadvertently creating a black hole in the process.

This might be an explanation for the Fermi paradox.

They do not want the US to replace Assad with a puppet, and they want to challenge US hegemony, which is becoming increasingly unilateral. The US recognizes this threat, and a number of people, such as Hilary Clinton have been talking about war with Iran. The US considers the dollar's role as international reserve currency, to be under threat, and it is. Also Iran has strategic control over the straights of Hormuz, where much of the world oil goes through. This is important because the dollar is no longer backed by gold, but rather, petrodollars - control over oil. If other nations start trading oil and other commodities in another currency such as Euros, or Rubles, US hegemony would be under threat. Also the rise of China is generally considered to be a threat, especially considering the weakness of the US economy.

The international reserve currency - the dollar, is becoming increasingly costly for other nations, the US prints money extensively, while effectively exporting the inflation to other countries who hold dollar reserves in their central banks. Many nations, will in unison, especially Iran, Russia and China, abandon the dollar.

Fabricated or not, there will be an incident, which will give the US excuse (or 'casus belli') to go to war with Iran. It might be in Syria, or in the straights of Hormuz. China and Russia, along with a number of weaker Asian nations (maybe India?), will the join the war on Iran and Syria's side. Simultaneously they will abandon the dollar, causing damage to the US economy. As a result thousands, maybe millions of people die.
