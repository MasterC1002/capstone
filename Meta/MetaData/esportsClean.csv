1326689335.0	oivzx	I don't know what's up with Fnatic's shop, I ordered something in September Last year, and haven't heard anything from them. I'm Down €149.29 and nobody will respond. 	infeza	313	35	48	"I like to buy a lot of eSports stuff, including shirts and whatever i can for supporting eSports, and i decided to buy a Fnatic LAN Bag listed here: http://www.fnatic.com/shop/product/145/Fnatic-M-A-S-K-LAN-Backpack.html

I purchased the bag on-line and paid for in full at $212.44 AUD (roughly USD) on 
29 Sep 2011.
I have emailed them several times about the issue, only got responses twice saying It's being processed. And the last 3 emails i sent (non threatening and polite) have not gotten any response what so ever.
 
This is killing esports.

**EDIT:** Got a reply finally! - They said they're contacting the manager to get on to me, let's see what he has to say.


**EDIT2:** Got a reply from the Editor in Chief of Fnatic, who's not affiliated with the shop at all but is helping with the issue. Hopefully we get it sorted soon.


**EDIT3** For anyone still following this thread, February now, haven't heard from the manager at all, Sending another email. Still no bag, or no refund...T_______T"	t5_2r08k	True

MLG is going full HotS 3 days after launch for its major event. As a long time CS player I am so jealous of the maturity of their community. We couldn't get the CS community to unite behind one game no matter what and it killed us. If only we could borrow SC's scene's acknowledgement that people like new shit, well at least in the NA scene. I can't speak for anyone but our region.

The production value was significantly improved but still not quite on par with GSL or Dreamhack. I already can't wait to see what they come up with next year! =)

What Valve did do with this tournament is set the bar for supporting a game's competitive scene. From the free in-game spectator client, the in-game banners, the tournament experience for the players, the pennant and broadcaster systems... all groundbreaking, and all no doubt soon to be copied. Really great to see Valve come through so well and I hope they can continue to be a pioneer.

Morbuzaan	32	1	25	"Long story short, they approached me attempting to pick up the semi-pro LoL team that I manage, but wanted to take 100% of our prize money and pay us paltry monthly salaries ($100 or lower).

I've added some excerpts from our chat below.

    iMp RusH (7:52): Hey there, would you and your team ever consider joining and being the League of Legends team of a big multi gaming organization?
    Morbuzaan (7:52): We would consider, yes
    iMp RusH (7:53): Ok, well i am the co-owner of the organization called Impulse eSports
    http://impulseesports.com/
    that it our website
    we are currently making a new website so that will be out soon, but for now we have that one
    Morbuzaan (7:53): I see
    Not a bad looking website
    iMp RusH (7:54): We have a porfesional Starcraft 2 team, and a Counter strike team, and now looking to get a high level league of legends team
    you guys would get benefits such as: overlays for streams, you would be able to get team jerseys
    you would be the manager, and you would be one of the co-managers of the organization
     (7:56): In the future we would be able to pay for the team to go to events
    such as LCS
    Morbuzaan (7:56): umm, you realize Riot pays for travel to LCS
    iMp RusH (7:57): I did not actually haha, but if there were any others, we would be able to pay for the team to go there
    ~~~~~~~~~  
    iMp RusH (8:30): the 5 players on wazabi would be getting $100 a month, and the money they win in tournaments would go to the team
    the team as in our team bank account 
    Impulse eSports bank account
    Morbuzaan (8:30): That's obscene
    You expect to pay us $500/month total
    And then take 100% of our prize money?
    We've won more than $500 in prize money in the 3 weeks we've been a team
    iMp RusH (8:31): considering one of the only tournaments you won you only got $600
    Morbuzaan (8:32): I've talked to a number of organizations interested in our team
    And you're the only one that's planning on taking prize money
    iMp RusH (8:33): How much of the prize money are other organizations planning to take?
    Morbuzaan (8:33): 0%
    iMp RusH (8:33): then how do they make any money off of it, and stay as an organization
    sponsors wont give that much
    unless you are a top level professional team
    Morbuzaan (8:34): You'd have to ask them
    iMp RusH (8:34): That just makes no sense to me.
    Morbuzaan (8:34): Well it makes no sense to me why we would join your organization if you're planning on taking our prize money, and paying us less than we win
    We'd literally be losing money to advertise your company
    iMp RusH (8:36): We are not looking to lose money by having a LoL team
    i guess were just on a different page.
    Morbuzaan (8:36): And we're not looking to lose money by joining an organization
    Why would we do that?
    I think you'll find every other competitive LoL team would agree with me
    iMp RusH (8:37): not sure how other organizations are offering that, but i guess they will probably die off soon, so anyways, goodluck
    Morbuzaan (8:37): Yeah, good luck finding a team
    ""Advertise our brand, and we'll give you less money than you'd make if you stayed independent""
    iMp RusH (8:38): good luck finding an organization that wont die off by having an LoL team




UPDATE:  I was just contacted by Marine, who is the actual owner of Impulse eSports.  He explained to me that Rush is one of the managers for the organization and does recruiting for them, but was mistaken on a lot of the details of the deal including himself being a co-owner of the organization.  Marine explained to me that their organization doesn't take any prize money from their SC2 players, and definitely wouldn't take 100% of prize money from a LoL team.  He also apologized for the misunderstanding, and was generally a pretty good guy throughout our conversation."	t5_2r08k	True

I consider myself lucky to have witnessed the golden years of competitive gaming FPS gaming in North America as a teenager and then later as a competitor. I remember playing in a pub, Striker 2000, and just worshipping the older guys with such talent. I remember driving to northern VA to the grand opening of my co-Striker pubber Mint’s lancenter Lanferno and watching Miller play. I remember the excitement with an intensity only a 16 year old could feel jumping into a car with his friends and team mates to drive to New York City to meet people I had only known online and then compete. I am almost embarrassed to realize Counter-Strike has been an active aspect of half my entire life. I’m sure there’s a Half-Life pun there somewhere. It was 12 years ago a friend brought over a disk entitled “Half-Life” and we found a mod that changed the course of my life. I tried to quit when excess play plus a genetic bone condition damaged my wrist and required multiple surgeries, but I always came back. I could recite stories for pages, but I won’t bore you. I just want you to understand how important Counter-Strike and last night’s news of an impending new release is to me. 

Solidarity is critical. The split between 1.6, CZ, and CS:S, decimated the communities of each. Granted, the 1.6 community remained in Europe, but I am strictly referring to the North American scene. We can argue for years which game is better and why, but that’s not productive. Each has value, but we must consider this important question above all else: “How can we best kick off an e-Sports FPS revival in North America?” The simple answer is we must unify the tribes. If you want to play a competitive RTS there is only one option, Starcraft 2. The FPS e-sports community suffers from a million titles. Notice, I do not refer to an e-sports revival. The future has never looked so promising for e-sports. We are already seeing an amazing revival. Look at what the Starcraft 2 community has achieved in only a year. It’s a bittersweet feeling watching MLG Starcraft display everything I ever wanted for Counter-Strike. 

Unification behind a new Counter-Strike makes sense. First of all, Starcraft 2 would not have the non-player spectator fan base if it was not attractive to behold. New graphics matter. Intel and Nvidia do not get an opportunity to show their latest and greatest hardware on a 10 year old game that could run on a ti-83 calculator. A newer, shiner, more robust Counter-Strike will allow for greater sponsorship opportunities. Spectators will appreciate the upgrade. From a competitive stand point only a Counter-Strike sequel possesses the clout to unite the distinct tribes of FPS behind one flag. It’s been 12 years, and there have been no contenders outside of the franchise for the FPS e-sports throne. 

Years ago during the CS:S, 1.6, or Source ProMod controversy I wrote an article arguing against implementation of a ProMod for Source. I detailed how in order for the competitive community to survive it needs a public community as a lead in for the professional scene. A new release will increase the player base with gamers who have never experienced a CS game before. Imagine a four way split between 1.6, CZ, CS:S, and CS:GO. All of us started out in a public server before venturing forth into irc and #findscrim, and therefore the last thing we needed was another separation. This still holds true.

We also need to improve our community. The CS community holds of honor of being regarded slightly higher than the infamous cesspool that is League of Legends and HoN. Look at the fan interaction in Starcraft. Look at how the entire community bands together with the common goal of improving everyone’s skill level and the state of the game. Secrets are shared and strategies are rapidly advanced. I know there is difference because of the one versus one adversarial nature of Starcraft and the team oriented tradition of Counter-Strike. In CS the mentality has always been “us, our team” against “them”, whereas in Starcraft everyone must grow together. I do not expect this to change, and I miss the trash talking on the old CAL Forums just as much as anyone (for those that remember professional troll MikehMike played for us), but we need to keep in mind that the community will need to support itself. 

We cannot count on Valve for anything. They clearly have no idea what they are doing. Look at their plans for the DoTA 2 launch. Who plans a 1.7 million dollar tournament for a game no one can play? Even I, who loathe DoTA, would buy the game if I had the opportunity to practice for a few months and then compete. It would be an infinitely better marketing investment to hold ten 100,000 dollar tour stops for DoTA 2 after release. That way gamers would purchase the game in an effort to win a spot at a tournament, and in addition keep the game in the news. Valve holds the highest selling, most competitive, longest longevity team FPS which is center in the collective e-sports mind, plans to release a sequel, but is unsure if they will host a huge tournament? I am so glad Valve is a private company, because if I owned shares and heard that marketing strategy I would topple over management. People it is up to us. 

Maybe I should re-title this piece “An Open Letter to the FPS e-Sports Community”. I want all of us to Unite. I want 1.6, CS:S, Battlefield, Call of Duty, Brink, AvA, Quake Live, and yes even the two guys still playing Unreal Tournament. Step up. Play hard. Go Pro.

There are already sites that pretty much aggregate news from around the world or specific games, but what I would create would essentially be sort of a mashup between Kotaku/Joystiq/Gizmodo except it would be more geared towards professional gaming and people who are into it rather than the casual crowd.  It would aim to create original content and not just ""oh so and so won MLG"" type of coverage.

I throw in ""professional gaming"" as eSports doesn't include things like the FGC and other genres.  I'm also curious as to what sites everyone reads currently to keep up with gaming news/esports/etc?

I'm concerned about what kind of company MLG is when they have their most successful year to-date and close out 2011 with mass layoffs ten days before Christmas.

So far, I count eight laid off IT folks now looking for new jobs. And I get the impression that's not all of them.

I'm posting this here to raise awareness about the situation and hopefully get some kind of feedback from MLG leadership."	t5_2r08k	True

1340595106.0	vjz5g	Building a good independent community	chobopeon	26	4	17	"How can I build a good independent community?

I recently started [turrbull.com](http://turrbull.com) in an attempt to create an esports forum that promotes good conversations. I think the existing talking platforms (TL, Reddit, Twitter, etc) all have major drawbacks (and of course have major strengths) that leave an opening for an alternative community. You can read more [here](http://turrbull.com/index.php?p=/discussion/28/what-is-turrbull.com).

Building a forum is interesting.

Right now we have about a dozen active users. That's not a big number (though judging from what I've read, it's a pretty good number to start the base) and almost all of them have worked in esports and have extensive experience that they bring to the table. Having this particular dozen or so users means that we get about two dozen posts per day at this point but that they're almost all posts with serious effort and thought put into them.

That's a big part of what I'd like to see. I wonder if it's possible to build a decent sized forum (as opposed to aiming to be the next TL, SA, 4chan, etc) where the level of discussion and content remains high. I don't want to run tournaments or own a team, I'd just like to promote good discussions.

How would you make a good community? What have you seen in other communities that works or fails? I'd like your feedback."	t5_2r08k	True

If you want to know what has been said but don't have the time to watch the whole thing, this is what you need.

It is not exhaustive and I chose the parts that I felt were the most relevant. You are welcome to comment on the document if you want to add points. I will make changes accordingly.

http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/forum/topic/5590643384?page=1
I disagree with MLG's payment policies and their handling of KESPA. I'm asking people to do this to help e-Sports, not MLG. If you have another event you want people to help get recognition for, feel free to add it in a comment.

I originally put this on the r/starcraft and have decided to put it here too as e-Sports isn't only pertinent to starcraft players.

I am hoping that the community can pull together to create some attention for the upcoming MLG in Anaheim. I know, this is a very last minute effort, but I think it is worth trying. We should contact various media angencies to get their attention of this event. We could do it via email, facebook, twitter, or whatever.

First, here are some actual media releases that I did find related to MLG.

[A Press Release of MLG on MSNBC]
(http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/47629944#.T8us8MWp2So)

[A Today Show Article](http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/47636148#.T8us9sWp2So) Describing CBS Interactive buying up the advertising rights to MLG and other pro gaming organizations.

[A CNBC article](http://www.cnbc.com/id/47633993) that is exactly the same as the Today Show Article

So, a comment on the press release. We would like an actual story and airtime on TV for MLG. So I think this is worth doing even though there is a press release.


Next, I'll list some things that are worth mentioning. Details about MLG I'm getting from the press release.

&gt; * Money Talks. Total prize pool is $195K.
&gt; * Prove it is professional. Mention CBS Interactive acquiring advertising rights. Mention that players are on professional teams, salaried, and have big sponsors. Mention the press release.
* Stress that it is international. There are players competing from different continents.
* Mention the fact that it is something mainly distributed online. Media loves stories about the internet and a changing society.
* Mention any top players that are really young (like Leenock/Maru) and will be playing at MLG. Media loves this kind of stuff. For example, the story of the 6 year old at a spelling bee.
* Mention date and location. Other than the national news giants, the others I have selected because they are close to Anaheim.

Next, some companies to contact. I searched their sites for ""MLG,"" and most have nothing except where noted.

National News Stations

&gt; * [MSNBC](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10285339/)
This has the most current info with the 3 articles listed above. Nothing really deserving of the title ""story"".
&gt; * CNN 
They have two feedbacks that are titled ""News Tip"" or ""Story Idea"". I'm not sure which is most appropriate. I leave to you to decide.
[CNN News Tip](http://www.cnn.com/feedback/show/?s=newstip), 
[CNN News Story](http://www.cnn.com/feedback/show/?s=storyidea)
* [Fox News] (http://help.foxnews.com/entries/500736-where-can-i-send-story-questions-corrections-or-news-tips) Has articles mentioning MLG from 2008. I hate to admit it, but it may be our best shot.
* [Marketplace from American Public Media](http://www.publicradio.org/applications/formbuilder/user/form_display.php?form_code=53214004afb5) This is actually a national public radio show about business news that I like to listen to once in a while. They sometimes run stories about niche business news. When contacting them some history of the business side of eSports may catch their interest. Maybe focus on the online distribution? Best part, is they are located in LA so they should be able to send someone over on short notice if they are interested.


Local News to Anaheim/LA, CA

&gt; * [Local NBC]

Late Night Talk Shows

They often do bits where they interview people at conventions/events. Sometimes the fans are the butt of the jokes. It's up to you to decide if they are worth contacting. Personally, I think it would be kind of cool to see MLG on one of these shows. These are some located in CA.

The game is pretty damn fun. It's an interesting take on the FPS genre. The Elite mode being used in the tournament is a fascinating format. The attacking team plays 1 v 3 with a rail gun, while the 3 defenders possess the rocket launcher. The attacker tries to capture the flag, which is available after 30 seconds. Once the 30 seconds are up, the attacker has to touch the flag within 15 seconds. It's extremely stressful and awesome.

These games never have anything really exciting to see in my opinion. The fights are sporadic and short and not very entertaining from a spectators point of view. And to top it all off, a typical game averages about 35-45 minutes. You can see who is going to win the game within the first 10-15 minutes, but the game is dragged on. The teams just wait until their carry has farmed for the whole game and can almost instantly kill the opposing team.

There is no hype comebacks like you would get in Street Fighter, no clutch 1v5 moments you would get in Counter-Strike, and no incredible microing that would blow your mind, like in StarCraft. The DotA genre is just a race to see whose carry could farm the most gold the quickest. 

Apart from being boring and too long to watch, It is not a spectator friendly game. If you haven't played the game, you won't know what's going on during a match. You can't get a guy who's never played the game to sit and watch it or even understand what he's watching."	t5_2r08k	True
1322646971.0	mul0x	Hostility in eSports towards console gaming	Spaceneil8	28	9	137	"This is something I've been meaning to address for a while now. There seems to be so much hostility towards console games as eSports. Besides certain fighting games, the console scene in general gets so much flak on a daily basis. I just find it incredibly hypocritical that people constant post that you should ""support all eSports"" but then they proceed to shit on competitive console gaming. It seems as if this scene consistently gets the short end of the stick. Slasher's show never covers Halo even though Ogre 2 just won his 5th national championship over the course of 8 years. The man is a legend yet he gets no recognition whatsoever. 


The questions I pose to you guys are:

Why are you personally hostile against console gaming? (if you are)

Do you consider competitive console gaming respectable as eSports?

Have you ever had any experience with competitive console gaming?

Have you ever tried to tune into some stuff like during an MLG? (and how you felt watching it)

Do you think competitive console gaming will every be respected as much as something like Quake, CS, or SC2?
and feel free to elaborate more on this issue.


Overall, I think this tension is just hurting eSports as a whole, and while the console players aren't old or mature as the other communities, and certainly not as vocal, they need some respect.


Thoughts? 


Edit: I understand the trolls will always bash console gaming, but I just want to see more respect from the more intelligent members of the community for console games.

Edit2: Upvote all the things :D, good discussion so far guys.

Edit3: I'm in the vast minority here, because most people here come from the PC side of things. I'll try to reply to everything but I might not have time."	t5_2r08k	True

EpicRewind is video capture software that has a key differentiating feature: RAM RollingBuffer mode. This works like an on-demand instant-replay: a game is hooked and the video is continuously buffered in system RAM, when something cool happens the user can save the buffer contents with the press of a hotkey. So rather than saving video from your entire gaming session you can just save the good stuff after it actually happens. In addition, EpicRewind provides some nice performance benefits over traditional capture software: video processing, encoding and writing to disk only happen when you choose to save a video clip. During video buffering, the contents of the framebuffer are just being copied to system memory X times per second based your specified capture FPS.

Key advantages of the RAM RollingBuffer:

    You don't need to pre-plan a gaming video, you can just play the game without thinking of the video at all. If something interesting happens you can always choose to save it after it's happened.
    Ideal for MMOs and Multiplayer games where 99% of the gameplay isn't worth sharing and the interesting stuff can happen at unexpected times.

Added benefits:

    One of the best benefits is that it saves you time by eliminating the need to dig through all your saved gameplay footage to find the good stuff.
    Saves disk space by not writing countless hours of video to disk your just going to throw away later after you dig out the highlights.
    More efficient use of system resources by not processing and encoding video the entire time your gaming.

You can find more information about EpicRewind here on our website along with some demonstration videos:

http://epicrewind.com

We are at the point now where we have a usable beta build and are looking for more folks to try it out. If this sounds interesting to you feel free to send me a PM and Ill get you signed up, alternatively you can also email me at:

contact@epicrewind.com

If you really like the idea, we've just launched a Kickstarter for the project here:

http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/848170399/epicrewind

1354901974.0	14gbiw	How to make Streetfighter successful for IPL	thatFGCstuff	24	5	15	"I would wish to remain anonymous.
When MLG failed to gain Street Fighter 4 from Capcom, the grassroots was accused of ""poisoning the Capcom well."" When UltraDavid published his guest editorial called Momentum Matters to help esport have a better understanding of the FGC's mindset, he was called a stooge, trying to make up excuses for why a partnership wouldn't work. To avoid people saying no one from the FGC contribute anything positive because they want everything to fail, and because IPL seem more open to suggestions,  I've decided to throw this out there. I don't claim to be to the ultimate authority in the fgc (there is no such thing).
After reading an interview with David Ting which he stated that he wanted ipl-fighters to be more of a spectacle and energetic, going so far as considering holding matches in a boxing arena with ring-girls helping players onto the ring. This is both very wrong and right.

It is right in the sense that his overall direction is on-point. Fighting game majors bring the hype, if you do not think so, your [wrong.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ooeBDyARug)
 The most important hype machine to get to come to your event is an electric crowd. Don't believe me? Watch the famous Daigo full parry video again on mute and stop watching when it begins to show the crowd, only watch video of the gameplay itself. Now rewatch it normally. The difference is striking. What will make your event a spectacle? Not ring girls or a boxing ring (which was attempted at CEO2012 and apart from ifc yipes' crazy intro, was considered corny) but a hype crowd.

Though, IMHO hype is probably the most overused word in the scene (hype is ... over hyped). I would caution IPL on the pitfall of trying to force or manufacturing hype. A good example was AE. The creator of SF4 (Ono) stated that he consciously made Yun &amp;Yang overpowered in order to give the people ""a villian to cheer against"".  I think in his head he imagined the grand finals for evo going: Yun player walks onto the stage and the crowd boos, Daigo walks onto the stage playing ryu and the crowd cheer, they play, Daigo wins, the crowd explodes in excitement. What actually happened? That version of SF4 was remembered as easily the worst and most unbalanced . Daigo? He ended up switching to Yun like everyone else. 

But this is written to help and not just criticize, so I will suggest something that is far less gimmicky and expensive than hiring ring girls and renting out an arena for days, on top of that it would give this IPL event real legitimacy to the fgc and it's viewers AND be exciting as all hell. IPL6: West coast vs. East coast.
Unlike other competitive gaming scenes, the FGC has arcade roots. This means people play in real life and the people they constantly play influence their style and mentality, on a macro level this means different styles and radically different views on characters/the game itself depending on the region. In general, East coast is famous for playing lame. Perfectly willing to run the clock, chip you to death, and overall constantly harass you with safe long range pressure in order to force you into making a mistake. West on the other hand (SoCal especially) is usually pioneering US rushdown style, fast block strings, frame traps, 50/50 mix-ups, and safe jump-ins to gauge their opponents breaking point while bullying them into the corner. The same exact character with the same exact moves often played in radically different styles has lead West vs. East to be less a rivalry of region and more a rivalry of philosophies. Each side has people that truly believe their style is the true style, so a big 10 vs 10  east/west blow up has been talked about since sf alpha 2, but no one has ever been able to organize everyone for one big event. This is something IPL can do to cause hype for their event and it would cost little for them.

As an aside I would like to add that the fighter crowd really does not like esport style commentators at all. We much prefer extremely knowledgeable ""color commentators"" like ifc Yipes. It would be a shame for him not to be allow to commentate for fear that he might to too ""urban"" or rowdy. Yipes has been on the mic for team spooky for a long time now, is allowed to say anything he wants and rarely ever cusses,even in the laid back environment of big 2.He is a grown man with a wive not a 12 year old who thinks dropping fbombs all the time is cool and edgy.

I know alot of the computer crowd dont like the FGC but since ipl is esports andthe fact that ipl has stated they often check subreddits I felt it was appropriate to put this here."	t5_2r08k	True

1314475938.0	jwdd6	DAE think that Riot Games is singlehandedly creating a bubble in MOBA esports?	Thealdo	24	8	18	"I ask this because they just keep throwing shit-tons of money at the League of Legends competitive scene but do not add any features that enhance competitive play. Features like replays and a spectator mode that doesn't bug out the game. The problems at MLG are not MLG's fault, it is all Riots buggy spectator mode. 

I think that the money Riot is throwing out there is basically forcing the other MOBA games to throw tons of money into their own scenes before they are ready. Do you think HoN is really ready to enter the 6 figures prize pools? Probably not but what other choice do they have?I'm sure it is making S2 uncomfortable. How about Valve and giving away over 1 million for a game that isn't even in beta yet...that is just ridiculous. 

We joke a lot about killing esports but I think Riot Games may singlehandedly kill a esport genre.  "	t5_2r08k	True

* The metagame is evolving towards more flag play and constant action. Offensively oriented teams are succeeding. 

* [Dodgepong](http://twitch.tv/dodgepong) and crew are producing high quality streams with multiple in game cameras for match coverage. Makes the viewing experience tenfold more enjoyable.

All this combined with the [XP cost of all items being halved](http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/01/24/tribes-ascend-is-halving-the-xp-cost-of-in-game-unlocks/) and the new patch (3 new CTF maps?) around the corner makes me quite encouraged.

Pozen	17	1	25	"So I notice over on http://www.esportsearnings.com/games/89/painkiller that clearly there was some money to be made playing Painkiller. Now, I'm really only interested in Starcraft, so looking at the list of top earners I recognise most of them, but Painkiller seems to have been a game with an awful lot of money in it.

So, my questions are: 
    -How many people watched it? Did the tournaments get streamed or what?
    -Who were the main sponsors, or was it the company that made it putting money in to try and make it a big esport?
    -How good was the game as an esport? I know quake and cs are the main two fps games for esports, but this seems to have had more money put in than either.
    -Just any other information you have on the game, I'm just interested in learning a bit more about esports history.

With the final day of the Medic update, not only did we get to see the eagerly awaited ‘Meet the Medic’ video, but one other bombshell was dropped – Team Fortress 2 is now free for anyone to play.

Yup, you heard that right, totally free to play! The game appears to be divided into 2 types of account right now, with buyers of the game labelled as having a ‘Premium’ account, and free players having a…free account. To convert a free account, all you need to do is purchase one item from the Mann co store in game.

Despite the many misgivings people have, this will surely bring a wealth of brand new players to the game, injecting some much needed fresh blood into both competitive and public play alike.

Read on to find out more on getting the most out of your TF2 experience!

Maximise your FPS

First of all, you’ve gotta be prepared to tweak TF2 a bit, especially if you’re not running a great computer setup. However, for those of us who aren’t technically minded, the lovely Chris has built an entire set of configs, with great instructions, that will get you enjoying the game with the minimum of fuss, and the maximum of FPS. You can find these configs over at: http://www.fakkelbrigade.eu/chris/configs/ – but please make sure you follow the instructions carefully.

Competitive Play

Tf2 has a dedicated competitive playerbase, and whilst there are people that feel the need to constantly complain about the state of competitive TF2, the majority of the rulesets are fair, and map pools are varied. It is relatively easy to get into playing competitively, with teams constantly recruiting, and even creating your own team is relatively painless, as long as you know 5 other players!

Some great resources to get into competitive play can be found at the primary EU leagues, ETF2L, who have their season 10 starting very soon – so just enough time for you to download TF2 and register your team/apply to join a team. Heres a great thread with everything you might need: 
http://etf2l.org/forum/league/topic-12510/

If you’re after information on the goings on within the Competitive TF2 scene, VanillaTF2 is a great resource, covering everything from upcoming matches to latest gossip and news. VanillaTV covers many of the higher profile games in real time, with a great lineup of casters involved. http://www.vanillatf2.org/

For more US orientated gossip, GotFrag is the place to visit, as long as you don’t mind putting up with a high amount of trolling.

Finally, if you want to jump straight into learning to play competitively, head on over to TF2Lobby, join a lobby and get playing!

Custom Huds

While the default HUD is pretty nice, there are alternatives out there – there is a thread here that covers most of them, but to single out a few of the more commonly used ones – broeselhud, Community HUD (this is the one I use), gmang Hud, M0reHUD. These are all used to a certain extent by the community as a whole. http://etf2l.org/forum/customise/?recent=313540

Frag Videos

If you needed more persuasion to download and install a free game, there is a huge selection of videos showcasing the game available.

Some of the best:

Lan Trilogy – by far and away one of the most epic TF2 movies, featuring frags and action from insomnia 40, one of the largest UK lans. http://video.alienwarearena.com/movie/1390/TF2_Lan_Trilogy__i40/ 

7 brothers who aren’t brothers – widely accepted by many as the definitive TF2 frag video, this contains footage from one of the longest running teams (now defunct), broder. 
http://video.alienwarearena.com/movie/1085/7_brothers_who_arent_brothers/

Auto Aim – A great sniping video by one of the best snipers in TF2, Jh. 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkZLJeQ1Nhc

Props to ""Trell"" for putting this piece together. Just trying to spread the word around.

There are many shows that air consistently on a weekly basis such as SOTG, 2GD, ITG, The Pulse, and even daily shows such as the Day9 Daily. Apart from that, the hours can switch between featured streamers from different games. If enough streamers are creative and dedicated enough, they can fill premium timeslots and create content such as Real Talk or teamhouse tours or AMA's etc. Can you imagine playing FFA, monobattle, or Star Strikers on television?!

Sorry for the SC bias, but this TV channel would have content from all the popular games! If there is enough content, there could even be separate channels for each game in the future.

The question is... Is this the ideal platform and ultimate goal for eSports? Are there major obstacles? The only one I can think of is viewer numbers but I don't know very much. There must be some useless mainstream channels out there that have pitiful viewer numbers. Also, it is a huge commitment to the producers of each show... And takes away the flexibility for people such as Day9 or JP to take a break or miss a show. That time can be filled with whoever is streaming at that moment.

1317352816.0	kw2bg	As Esports become more spectator oriented...	Sykodelic	17	3	14	"FPS has been finding itself put on the backburner in the competitive gaming world, and for a very clear reason.

As it is now, FPS games are horrible to watch, I realized this while tuning into some of the matches at the ESEA LAN last weekend, and I couldn't take it because they'd always be spectating some player getting fancy on a box in the bomb site, when you'd glance in the topright corner and realize 3 kills just went down that you totally missed.This makes for FPS being a pretty drab viewing experience as you only have a 1 in 10 chance of actually seeing a frag from the killers POV.

But like 30 minutes ago, I thought of a simple, and likely easily implemented feature that would change this. Smartcamera.

Essentially, the spectators (and commentators) would be about 15-20 seconds behind the actual live game, this would allow smartcamera to preemptively know when something noteworthy like a frag, nade toss, or objective completion occured, and bring the camera to it. Instantly making any FPS every bit as exciting to watch as something like Starcraft or DotA.

Valve already put something sort of like this in DOTA2, hopefully theyre wise enough to throw it into CSGO as well.

Personally, I think this is a major development in the world of esports. It's a Market Test, where the audience will vote with their wallets. I completely understand that putting on these large offline events requires way more capitol than simple ad revenue can bring in. I also understand that PPV only really works when you have exclusive content, and Starcraft 2 matches are anything but exclusive at the moment. There is too much good content available.

The hosts of the event, WTF Eventz, have presented expected figures of 200,000 visitors for the event, and 20,000 gamers. 

They have also listed a large number of games (SC2, CoD4, CS, SFIV) in which they will host tournaments with respective prize pools ranging from $6,000 to $40,000. What is strange about all this is that there is, as of yet, no information whatsoever as to who or what the sponsors are. 

Over on [tek-9](http://www.tek-9.org/forum/call_of_duty_series-46/call_of_duty_4-13/40000_cod4_india_lan-99729.html?page=6#comment-2643628) there has been an on-going discussion about the legitmacy of the tournament, with kyochi (fnatic CoD4 player) writing:

&gt;""As per our initial investigation IGC looks like an event which will never happen &amp; even if they are able to hold the event 
the prizes won't be paid. Key findings -

I know it probably isn't most peoples cup of tea here, but I think MMOs have an untapped source for a esport community. No MMO really has been successful because of very high grind rate to get into a competitive stage (gear ect), also a game mode that is interesting for the spectator. 

Guild Wars 2 changes this like Guild Wars did. Where your armour/items doesn't matter and not having to do any PvE (Near enough), you can go straight into PvP with full gear if you want.


**Battle of Kyhlo (Conquest mode)**

&gt; Two teams of five players are matched up against each other. The objective is to be the first team to reach 500 points. Points are awarded through holding capture points and kills. There are 3 capture points on the map, and when captured, each location grants one point every two seconds. Each player kill grants five points(we saw kills give 10 at last game convention). If neither team reaches 500 points, the team with the most points will be declared the winner after the 15 minute time limit. The average time for a game is 8-13 minutes, depending on the balance of the teams contesting. 

[MAP](http://images.mmorpg.com/features/5509/images/gw2pvp2.jpg)


In a tournament setting I am guessing it will be best of 3 or 5 maps. There has only been 1 map released so far but there has been announced that there will be many more but not sure how many. Each map has a gimmick for instance Kyhlo's is a trebuchet that can fire over to each point dealing massive damage. 

--------------


I have a few concerns if it will be good and wondered what other people think. Some of the biggest problems I am thinking of is that GW2 is based around mainly the objectives and not fighting. If you compare it to other games such as CS/LoL/SC2 the objectives aid the game but don't rule it, if you understand this point. Yes in CS you have to plant the bomb but if you don't kill the enemy and the enemy kills you, you will lose. 

In GW2 it has very similar qualities to League of Legends Dominion which has been scrutinized as a bad mechanic. Meaning that it's all about the mobility and not fighting. In a way, in dominion it is better to flee from your point than die to lose that point and maybe another as your team is down a player for some time. I see GW2 Conquest in the same manner as a cat and mouse chase. For each point whomever has the higher numbers e.g. 2vs3 there's no point in for the 2 to stay and try to protect the point and die. It's better off to flee to another point to capture it/defend, or regroup with more people and fight them. In which way if you have the upper hand with more numbers they will flee and it all goes in a cycle. It's not like in CS where 1 person can take on 5, MMOs are different.

It's hard to also say as the game is not out yet how well fighting will be fights could last a long time or could be quite short compared to other MMO's which have healers. Can GW2 pull of other modes than conquest. Maybe ANet has chose conquest because a 'deathmatch' mechanic wouldn't work. I had always thought a TF2 style of objective points would be much better in GW2 than what conquest is because it forces the fight rather than making people run away.

Will this be fun to play or watch? I just wondered what other peoples thoughts are on this really.

1298530988.0	frnac	Ingredients for a spectator e-sport	solomute	15	3	8	"I would define a spectator sport as a sport that people watch despite not being players themselves, simply because they enjoy the experience of watching it.

So what goes into making this happen? Here are my ideas:

* A vastly higher skill ceiling than skill floor

This one's pretty obvious. You need a game where the very best players will wipe the floor with the noobs. You can't have a sport where practically anybody can reach the tournament. This is for a few reasons - The first is identifiable players. You need to have a decent core group of players who can consistently reach and win tournaments to act as recognizable icons of that sport. Golf has Tiger Woods, Basketball has Kobe Bryant, Starcraft has BoxeR, Quake has Fatal1ty (just picking who the public would be most familiar with, not necessarily who is successful right now). The second reason is that a game that anyone can win doesn't attract competitors who want to be the best - they will tend to leave for games where their efforts at gaining skill will be rewarded more.

So how much higher should the skill ceiling be? My thought is that there should be at least four distinct tiers of play, where a tier can be thought of as a separation of skill level so great that it is simply not worth it for a player or team from one tier to compete seriously against an opponent from a different tier. In the ELO ranking system, this is about 400 ranking points, so the highest levels of tournament play should feature teams and players who can achieve ELO ranks at least 1600 points above those of teams and players who do not seriously apply themselves to the game.

Another consideration is that the potential skill ceiling of the game should be beyond human capabilities - If the ceiling is within human capabilities, if people can routinely play ""perfect games,"" you end up with a lot of people clustered at that ceiling and you again lose the quality of having top tier competitors who are genuinely above their peers.

* It has to be easy to watch

It should be fairly simple for a spectator to watch the game from start to finish and not miss any of the events which significantly affect its outcome. Especially if the game is divided into individual ""rounds"" or ""plays,"" the viewer should be able to easily see every event that contributes to the outcome of each individual round or play.

This is where I feel like Counter-Strike really fails. The action is so spread out over the map that especially as a casual viewer watching a demo or hltv, you really miss a great deal of the action, and even a VOD or professionally-produced broadcast with a cameraman who knows the game doesn't help all that much. The team-based modes of Quake like CTF and TDM also suffer from this. Quake 1v1 VODs sometimes frustrate me because they don't switch between the players often enough for me to keep tabs on the hp/armor status and general location of both players, but it's practically impossible to miss a frag. Quake matches can also be pretty hard to watch if you don't know the map (I still haven't internalized the layouts of even some of the most popular 1v1 maps since I only play CA myself). Fighting games are very easy to watch. Starcraft takes some knowledge of the units before you can really know what's going on, but a good VOD cameraman will catch everything significant. TF2 focuses the action around the medics and control points in a way that is pretty easy for a veteran cameraman to help the audience keep up with it, though you will miss a lot of the action on the flanks (you hardly ever see scout fights in live VODs).

* It has to be fun to watch

This mostly has to do with the pacing of the game, meaning the rate at which momentum can swing between the opponents and the frequency of events that affect the outcome of the game.

This is the problem I have with Counter-Strike and Quake, for pretty similar reasons. A Counter-Strike match starts right off with a round that hands a pretty big advantage to one team, and a very good chunk of the rounds in the match are spent with one team in a ""save"" mode where they are not terribly likely to win the round, just to kill as many enemies as possible and force them to spend money. Watching a round where you're saying ""well, I know this team's going to win, the question is by how much"" is not terribly exciting. Same deal with Quake, a very good chunk of the match is spent with one player or another in a ""down"" position where they are not a serious contender for a frag, and maps very frequently end up one-sided even between evenly matched opponents simply because one player got map control and the other player couldn't break it. I think that a good chunk of what makes a game fun to watch is the potential for any individual play to go huge - in American football, any play can be a touchdown, in baseball every pitch can be a home run. I feel like fighting games are the only e-sports that really nail this aspect.

tl;dr E-sports need to be entertaining for non-players to watch in order to get popular."	t5_2r08k	True

After tweeting around a bit on Twitter asking for help I had Steelseries point me towards Reddit because I am looking for some advice regarding E-sports. I’l l get to that in a second though, please allow me to introduce myself before we move on.

My nickname is Chevelle and I’m 23 years old and live in The Netherlands. I do currently have a parttime job but it’s only something temporary and I do have a lot of time left aside.

Now I have a huge history with gaming. One of the very first games I played seriously though was at the age of 12-13 when I got Counter-Strike: Source. I have been given chances in that game even though I was young and took those chances and got up to a high level of play. After 4-5 years of playing Counter-Strike I ended up having real life friends convince me to try World of Warcraft. I instantly got hooked and started playing that hardcore. In The burning crusade I ended up raiding end-game and same for Wrath of the Lich king and Cataclysm. In cataclysm I even ended up setting up my own 10 man guild and leading/managing this … this has been going on for roughly 2 years now. (having my own guild that is) I do all this with a burning passion. And that is how I do it and hope to continue doing it for many many years.

I’m looking to perhaps grow my guild into several games. (we are currently working on a new website which will not only represent WoW) One of my ways to grow our popularity and get our name out there is starting to stream. I have started streaming roughly 2 weeks ago and stream pretty much every day (WoW and Starcraft2) I do this for pretty much 6 hours a day quite easily. 

I actually managed to attract 25 viewers at one night by giving away 2 Heart of the Swarm beta keys to random viewers which was a great success and felt great to do! Everybody was so happy and I just loved doing it , it made me feel all warm inside really. And I’d love to do more of this.

Now after that little story about me … if there’s any gaps you’d like me to fill please do ask. But let me get to my actually issue now. I have been poking around on Twitter for support and guidance as to where to go now. I want to get bigger with streaming and want to grow my guild into an actual organization if possible. But I’m not sure on how to approach this. I was lucky to get my hands on HoTS beta keys to give away. But it’s hard to get my hands on anything else to make people happy with without spending too much of my own money … which is very limited.. I only work a parttime job and do not earn a great living with it.

Now I was hoping if there were people around here that could help me with this. Help me find a way to make this work and help me do what I love doing which is gaming and entertaining. So far feedback on my stream has been great with the 10-15 viewers I get a night at the moment people seem entertained and I communicate with my viewers a lot and try being the best I can be for their enjoyment.

Please help me make the gaming community a better place , and help me make myself a happier person by being able to help others. I need a place for this passion for gaming and I need your help in order to that because I’m lost trying to do it all by myself.

Thanks a lot in advance,

Regards,
Chevelle.

I recently took on the 'responsibility' of becoming a moderator of this subreddit and with that, I am hoping to grow it's audience. As an eSports journalist/editorial writer, I am a frequent visitor of this page, and a lot of my content gets posted here.


Despite the ever-increasing popularity of eSports titles and their respective subreddits (such as /r/leagueoflegends and /r/starcraft), very seldom do those involved in pro-gaming visit this page. There isn't anything wrong with that, but being who someone who writes very general non-game specific eSports content, I feel this is the only place (on reddit) I can promote my work. Unfortunately, I feel (and I'm sure others whom post their work here feel the same way) that the great content being posted here is being overlooked.


Of course I encourage everyone to stay subscribed to their game-specific subreddits, but if you're interested in some all-encompassing eSports content and other work that may 'fall between the cracks' - this is the place to be!


With that goal in mind, I have created an official **Twitter** account for the page (www.twitter.com/eSportsReddit). This account will automatically tweet (every 30min) any new posts that are made in this subreddit. Hit it with a follow if you're interested in seeing what type of content is posted here. This should help promote the subreddit, and the popularize the content being submitted here.

**EDIT:** (Feb 12, 2013)

&gt;Yesterday a friend of mine (who is a consistent contributor to this subreddit) made me aware that his comments/posts were no longer appearing in this subreddit. I investigated further (explored the admin panel for the first time, in more detail) and it appears there was a lot of *automated blocking/spam filtering* going on. Although this feature does pick up some legit spam, it was also automatically censoring posts of great people who contribute quality content to this page. If you've posted here in the first and been *auto-blocked*, don't let that stop you from returning to /r/eSports and posting again! I will keep a closer eye on things and make sure no one is inappropriately filtered. Contact @eSportsReddit or message me (/u/hydrolis) if you have any questions/concerns.

Why does it seem that FGs are in their seperate catagory 	fgfan	17	7	23	"i just wanted to start off by saying that i'm not asking if FGs are esports or not. The term esports is really hard to define, and there are obvious differences between the FGC and the communities that SC2 and LoL have.

For starters, it seems that when people think of IPL or MLG, no one mentions fighting games. The FGC barely participates in those tournaments, while the SC2 and LoL communities show up in force. Is it solely because the FGC existed before the modern ""esports"" tournaments of north america existed? 

How come europe has never warmed up to fighting games, but they love CS, LoL, and SC2? The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that in dreamhack, SF4 is booed every tournament when it comes on the main stage.

Why does the FGC see drama and celeb status of players in a much different light? It takes alot for the FGC to get pitchforks, while /r/starcraft does it for the most simple things. Most of the FGC defending Aris during crossassault drama (a female participant in the contest complained that Aris was sexually harassing her). In fact several participants in the show defended aris against those allegations while Esports commentators and gaming journalists demanded that he apologized. The only player that is worshipped to the same level as sc2 and LoL players is Daigo. Sure some other players are approaching the SC2 and LoL fandom, but prepared to be ridiculed by the community if you ask for their signatures. 



It seems that there is a drastically different dialgoue when people talk about the FGC. Why are they so much more different? Is it because they historically kept to themselves and their arcade roots? Are there any other reasons?"	t5_2r08k	True

I'm a massive SC fan which in turn got me into K-Pop, which in turn got me into Korean variety shows, which in turn got me into Korea in general. After not getting into any of the studies I really wanted to get into this summer, I decided to take three months off life back home in Norway and just experience Korea. And after being here for a month I want to try to find a way to sustain staying here longer.

It might sounds weird to ask, ""Through eSports?"", but it kind of makes sense. Even with having a passion for computer games and the competitive elements that comes with it, I never saw myself getting a job in the eSports industry. Since I'm from Norway the eSports scene is rather small and I don't think there's many people actually living off of eSports back home. From what I've managed to gather, there's basically no one except for a few competitors.

But now that I'm in Korea the possibilities are much bigger as there is an actual industry here. There might be foreign companies searching to establish something based in Korea, foreign media houses searching for Korean coverage or maybe even Korean companies trying to reach out to the foreign market more than they manage themselves. Maybe a foreign team that needs PR contents for their players who are down here. Or a Korean team that wants to reach the foreign market. I'm thinking in any game here. Even though SC is where my heart lies, that doesn't mean I don't enjoy everything else that is growing and thriving, like LoL. I've seen that firsthand down here and it's freaking huge! I want to see all eSports grow.

Sitting here I'm not sure what more to write or what I'm hoping to get out of this.

I'm not an expert in any field whatsoever, but I feel like I'm above the average bloke when it comes to general knowledge in the entire IT-field and I learn things I don't know fast. My English is decent both written (?) and oral (been mistaken for being American by Americans down here). I love photography and filmography and because of that I own a 7D with a set of lenses and I have some funds available to buy things like an extra mic or two, or some lighting. I also know my way around most commonly used publishing platforms and I have a PC I can run most of the things I've encountered in terms of applications. And I also know PHP and MySQL if that somehow would be useful. Last but not least, I consider myself a good people-person. Just getting in there and talking with people I've never met before is something I love to do.

TLDR: Anyways, what I'm wondering is; does anyone have any tips on how to get in touch with the right people? Or maybe someone reading this subreddit IS the right people?

If I'm breaching any unwritten rules of r/esports then I apologize and I'll delete my post as soon as possible!

I always thought the competitive reasoning behind ES in a double-elimination format was that you still get your one match loss but get punished more for it than you would without ES. This makes winning each series, as well as each game in the series, more important, fostering competition.

I never really thought of this as necessarily the best way of running a tournament, but just a different way that punishes a player more for losing. And all the arguments I've heard against ES so far have come from a *spectator* PoV, with fans arguing that ES should be out in order to allow for more upsets/make it easier to cheer for underdogs.

So now I'm left wondering as to how ES stands up in a competitive format. If the argument against ES is that it make it easier for losers to win, wouldn't that mean ES is a better competitive format? Or is ES just a different type of format, with ES promoting a tourney format that punishes losses heavy and not having ES promote a tourney that doesn't punish loses as hard?

**TL;DR** Does not having extended series make the tournament format less/more **competitive**, or just different?"	t5_2r08k	True

1317374955.0	kwb5e	What jumpstarted the growth of competitive CS 1.6?	Decency	14	2	7	"CAL offered a place for teams of enormously differing skill levels to play competitive matches in a team-based environment, simulating top tier play. I have to assume this gave rise to so many teams with interest in the game because there's simply no alternative explanation that I can find. I love playing games all-out seriously to win, and I'm pretty good at a variety of competitively played ones, but I can't find many good avenues to compete.

I keep looking around and seeing games like LoL, HoN, and various shooters trying to create a competitive scene by throwing money at the top 10-20 teams and pretending that's going to stir growth among lower level players. If anything, all it's doing is widening the gap between those who are passionate about the game and those who compete at it. I miss being able to open up a CAL-Open teams list and see hundreds of teams competing not even for a monetary prize, but simply for a promotion to the next highest level of play. Is this league-oriented style of team based competition truly gone?

I came late to the CS scene so I can't say for sure where it truly began, but I doubt my assumptions are far off base. Does anyone have personal knowledge or informative links describing the early days of the game's competitive environment and why it has remained such an outlier.

Worth mentioning is the [Collegiate StarLeague](http://www.cstarleague.com/) for SC2, which I tried and failed to gain interest in at my university. Nothing else comes to mind and it's disappointing to me. I hope that Dota2 and whichever shooter ends up the favorite for eSports in the next generation of games cater to low level competition as well as can be done."	t5_2r08k	True

As e-sports is picking up steam and which game to choose is obvious, I feel like all my time invested into FPS was wasted. All the countless hours in Quake, DoD and CS. The players/fans and money have moved away from FPS to RTS/DoTa and Fighters. 


Anyone else feel like they choose the wrong game to get good at?


-EDIT- I shouldn't have used the word ""waste"". I had plenty of good times with friends on vent/mIRC/LAN. I don't know what word to use really. But it sucks I guess right now for us FPSers.

1314057022.0	jr461	Developing a new gaming league specific to the CS Series	deviantryan	12	1	18	"I've toyed with this idea for a while, and am now doing it just to see what happens and who is interested.

I'm a very experienced web programmer, and I have pubbed, scrimmed, pugged and 10manned on CS:Source since the betas.  I'm now developing a gaming league site, but the point of it is to be dedicated to the CS Series.   That means CS:1.6, CS: Source and when CS:Global Offensive is available, I plan to fully support that as well.  I would like to bring CS back to the popularity it had in the CAL days.  Remember that?  When everyone was playing and actually having fun on this game?

I've already started coding, and have teams, players, and accounts finished (I work very fast).  I would like experienced players who scrim often and maybe those who are on teams and in any competitive leagues, to chime in and mention what they like and don't like about current leagues.  I will supply a URL to the site after I have something solid (only a few days from now).

I will x-post this to r/Gaming after I've seen some feedback from esports guys first.

**EDIT**: What I left out is that I am going to open up an API with my system too, so other gaming teams/sites can do functions for the league on their site, like lookups, stats, rosters, etc.  This will likely be Open Source and an XML or JSON based return."	t5_2r08k	True

I need to finish school, and save quite a bit of cash to get me started. But it's something I'm really excited to do.

My plan thus far is to have screens mounted near every table (or at least the ones near a wall), and to have rentable consoles that can be hooked up to those screens. People could bring their own games, or borrow from the store's library of games. We'd show as much professional gaming as we could on the other monitors (Barcrafts, MLG, Gaming related TV shows/Podcasts, or maybe just some pro gamers streaming). Also, it would only be a real 'bar' after 6:30, to allow the younger crowd access.

You guys are pros at this on what I'm assuming to be a more temporary basis. What suggestions do you have for me, and what would get you to frequent my bar?

1326843026.0	olk61	From eSports Pioneer to Funeral Director: The Story of Chris Lemley and Team Pandemic.	Portlande	10	2	6	"I have no where else to appropriately publish so this is exclusively for reddit for now. I thought the community might find this interview interesting, Chris Lemley and Team Pandemic were major players in the eSports landscape from 02-08. The interview is not finished, this is only the first part. 

Around 2002 Mark Dolven started Team Pandemic which quickly became one of North America's premier multi-gaming organizations. In it's prime, Team Pandemic garnered multiple championships in eSports' biggest tournaments, and landed some of the biggest corporate sponsorships of its time. In 2006, as Mark Dolven and many others in the industry went to the Championship Gaming Series (CGS), Chris Lemley took over team Pandemic and stayed with it until its retirement. 

**Could you start by stating your name, who Pandemic was, and what you do now?**

&gt;My name's Chris Lemley, I was the President and General Manager of Team Pandemic from 2006-2009, and I've since settled back into the family business -- I'm a fifth generation funeral director at Lemley Funeral Service in Atkins, Arkansas.


**That's quite a contrast of careers, from gaming entrepeneur to funeral director, do you perfer one over the other?**

&gt;It's hard to compare the two, they're entirely different lifestyles with completely different pros and cons... but it's obviously hard to top what I was able to call a 'career' for a few good years with Pandemic....
&gt;
&gt;My life is much more stable these days, and I take pride in being able to say that what I do is genuinely a service to others in a time of need. That's not to say I don't miss the rollercoaster of trying to run an eSports organization profitably, the travel or the fact that it never seemed like we were 'working,' but I don't know that I could have the family or the security that I do today if I was still chasing that dream.


**Would you go back to a job similar to the one you had if eSports was more stable?**

&gt;I think about it from time to time, and I often find myself wanting to get involved in things part-time or as a consultant, but the circumstances surrounding the closure of Team Pandemic, and my move to the funeral home are largely the same reason I don't see myself leaving, now.  
&gt;
&gt;At the end of 2008, the economy went down the toilet.  Dell, our largest sponsor, saw their stock drop by more than 50% in a matter of days.  Everyone was struggling financially and esports was in a very uncertain state, but we tried to carry on.
&gt;
&gt;The longer we operated in a state of limbo, I began asking myself if what I was doing was truly what I was meant to do.  I prayed about it, argued back and forth with myself (and my family) wether we should keep spending, keep holding onto faith that other sponsors would come aboard -- not just to our own organization, but to events as well.  We weren't even sure what tournaments would happen even if we could afford to get teams to them, *everyone* was struggling.
&gt;
&gt;In the fall of 2009, my uncle passed away unexpectedly.  The funeral home needed my help, and I was exhausted from trying to operate on a budget that was no longer fair to my players or to the expectations of our fans. Everything came together for a reason I believe.


**Do you still keep tabs on esports in general?**

&gt;Only through my close friends that are still involved in some way.  I'll see news in my Twitter timeline that piques my interest from time to time, but I no longer actively pursue it.  I can't remember when I finally kicked the habit of checking all the sites as soon as I sat down at a PC, but my homepage hasn't been set to GotFrag in years and I don't even know what most teams pages look like these days.


**Pandemic was once as big as or bigger than a lot of the teams that are still big players today like EG, CoL, SK, Fnatic. What was the highlight of your pandemic career?**
 
&gt;If I had to choose one, I'd say Dreamhack Winter 2007. It capped off a phenomenal year and also was the largest prize purse we'd ever brought home, $45,000. We just couldn't miss that year... the other 'powerhouse' American organizations of the time had sold out to CGS and the entire independent side of the industry was ours for the taking, and quite frankly, nobody even came close for a long time. That year we signed the largest corporate sponsorship *(Pandemics deal with Dell Unitversity, which was an umbrella effort for Dell, Intel, and Microsoft)* eSports had seen to date, made history with a number of our squads, and everything we did seemed to go right.


**Regarding sponsors, Pandemic, along with the other big teams, had been among the first to sign sizable team sponsorship deals. What was it like for you personally garnering those sponsorships, what did pandemic do different than other teams in that regard?**

&gt;I can't even remember what my mindset was going into those meetings, but we wouldn't take no for an answer.  After months of back and forth with what seemed like no real intention to press forward, I drove down to Austin and met with our contacts face to face.  I was as green as you can get -- I'd never been in a situation like that before, fresh out of college facing down the suits at Dell for my first real 'business meeting..'
&gt;
&gt;Somehow it worked, and I knew before I left that day that we would do business together.  I think they understood how genuine and passionate I was about what I was pitching to them... I didn't have the fancy metrics and polished marketing kits that we'd develop later, I just sat down and talked to them about what we could accomplish together.
&gt;
&gt;At one point in the meetings, long after it was decided that they would be working with us, the most important man in the room stopped me to ask 'what level of a team' we were... if, in comparison to baseball, we were like a minor league team, a major league organization or what.  He didn't even know if we were any good. And it didn't matter. He somehow entirely missed out on what we believed was one of the core values of my presentation, but picked up enough from the rest to green light the deal.  From that day forward I realized none of these sponsors (besides the truly gaming endemic, such as Razer and Steelseries) would likely ever understand a thing about what we actually were.
&gt;
&gt;...It always felt like I was selling a make believe industry.


**What did those big tech companies care about, hits, sales? How did they keep track of their ROI?**

&gt;There's no rules to what makes a pro gamer, theres no schedule we have to follow, no events definitively more important than others... Everything is relative and subjective. Each sponsor had their own unique goals and ideas of how to best utilize us to obtain them. Some came up with elaborate marketing events that, in retrospect, made no sense at all... but who were we to tell them they couldn't spend their money with us in that way. Others sat back and let us do what we do, latching on to our own campaigns and natural initiatives.
&gt;
&gt;The 18-24 year old male demographic gets referred to as the 'Holy Grail' of advertising. Supposedly we're the hardest to reach, have the shortest attention spans and so on. When pro gaming was in its heyday, it was being pitched as the new and exciting way to get those eyeballs on your product.
&gt;
&gt;Things were a little simpler then. You hadn't had any failures yet (CGS, WSVG, CPL), it was fresh... Internet functionality wasn't as developed as it is today, and online leagues were few and far between, so tight knit communities formed and it was easy to focus on specific leagues and events instead of this overload of competing ideas and clones that we have today. Console gaming hadn't really entered the online market yet, either, so it was easier to concentrate focus on one system (PC) and a handful of titles.
&gt;


*(During the end of Pandemic's lifespan, their SC division started the careers of gretorp, kawaiirice and its manager Xeris.)*

**Do you have any thoughts on Starcraft 2, I know you dont keep track of esports that much, but have you noticed the esport industry boom SC2 has generated?**

&gt;I'm happy to see it uniting some of the focus back into one game. I haven't kept up enough to comment on the state of the game or the industry around it, but I don't see anything stealing away the spotlight right now... And that's a great thing for all parties invested in the scene however long it lasts.


**There has been talk of eSports being a bubble market, durring the time you spent running pandemic do you think sponsors were over investing into orgs and teams like yours which resulted the *pop* and collapse of events around 08?**

&gt;Our entire country was operating inside a bubble market when it popped in 2008/2009, those circumstances were much, much larger than gaming. That said, and alot of my former peers will be upset with me saying this, I don't believe that the vast majority of eSport organizations/teams offer enough return on investment to be worth the risk companies take in doing business with them.  Ask yourself how many peripherals, laptops, mice or whatever must be sold -- as a direct result of your involvement with these players -- to simply break even on the cost of travel and salary for those involved.
&gt;
&gt;The ones that remain in business have done a phenomenal job of adapting and coming up with new ways to expand their reach and further their appeal, but I still question the efficiency of the business model.  Professional gaming still lacks the structure and mass appeal necessary for consistent growth worthy of the dollars being thrown around.
&gt;Event organizers are the ones who hold the power to create such an environment, but we've all seen how that's turned out so far. Imagine where we'd be if CGS had taken off, if WSVG was still airing on CBS and so on...

The Reload is a weekly show dedicated to following the world of eSports. Everything from tournaments, team changes, drama, and more is fair game.

Since it was Christmas/The Holidays this week there really wasn't much going on in the world of eSports in the terms of major news. So we decided to do a special show where we talked about the beginnings of BossFight as well as our future plans. This episode will give you a sneak peak inside the inner-workings of our minds and what we have planned for 2012. We go over new show ideas, website ideas, and brand new huge project ideas that we've been cooking up since the inception of the idea of BossFight TV.

I am friendly with a very large company that is based in Asia and that sponsors most of the major eSports events in EU/Asia. They are looking for a writer blogger for next year that they can sent to different events throughout the world (all expenses paid) to do event coverage. The gig pays well. 

They asked me to put together a shortlist of eSports writers and I wanted to see if I could get some input from you all. Looking for experienced, proven eSports (all of eSports not just SC2) writers that can do event coverage but also feature articles.

names and links to work is preferred. You can DM me if you don't want to put them here. 

Thanks all! 

edit: Just to be clear, I am in no way involved with the hiring process - or the sponsor for that matter. I was simply asked to put together a short list of awesome esports writers. 

**update:** I have submitted my shortlist on which several people mentioned in this thread made it onto and many of who(m?) I wouldn't have known about otherwise. Thanks for helping out! "	t5_2r08k	True

I'm doing a study on socially active gaming. I'm trying to get a feel for how gamers would respond if they had the option to play/spectate in a social environment instead of just at home alone. I want to prove that nerd-gamers like myself aren't the socially inept people we're stereotyped as. I recently started a Starcraft II club at my university, and on the first day we had over 20 people show up without any form of advertising. Also, feel free to upvote the subject if you consider yourself a social gamer! (This way I can get a number of how many people are truly into social gaming.)

That being said, if you could help me out by answering a few questions, that'd be fantastic.

1. What keeps you interested in E-sports?
2. Do you enjoy playing your respective game by yourself or with others? 
     * If with others, do you prefer to be in the same room or connected over the internet? 
     * Are there specific games that you like playing alone, rather than with friends?
3. What sort of events would motivate you to leave your man cave and play in a social environment?
4. Do you like conversing with others, whom might originally be strangers (soon to be friends, of course), about your game?
5. Do you currently have a place that you go to play with your friends (or even strangers)?
     * If so, where do you go? 
     * What kind of environment is it?

Who are the best writers, bloggers and original content creators in all of e-sports?

(Being a caster is great but if all you do is cast games, it's not quite what I'm looking for. Additionally, running a website is invaluable but also doesn't qualify in and of itself.)

For the past several years, I've been exclusively inside the SC2 world and so I couldn't tell you who is doing really good work for CS, Quake, SF4, etc. I'd love to hear your opinions and for you guys to link to their work.

My nominees for SC2:

DjWheat (djwheat.tv) - The multi-gaming master is taking a relative break (ie he's only hosting the biggest online tournament in the world and not doing the million other pieces of content he usually pumps out) but he's still one of the best.

Artosis (gomtv.net, http://www.youtube.com/artosistv) - Casts the biggest tournament in the world, is an old school legend, is good at the game and still finds time to give us tours of pro houses and interviews of otherwise inaccessible Koreans. He is the man.

JP McDaniel (youtube.com/itmejp) - MLG guru and content machine. SC Center, JP &amp; Friends, State of the Game plus regularly casting a handful of other semi-major tournaments. He has not seen the sun in many days but it's worth it.

Evoli (formerly of GosuTrolling, now of SixJaxGaming) - Most known for breaking the NASL story, Evoli is quietly providing the SC2 community with a steady stream of great interviews and quality writing.

Andrew Clark (ESFI) - Probably the least known of the group, he's been doing something really strange for e-sports: actual journalism. He follows leads, gets quotes, breaks stories and is now flying out to some European events. If he keeps it up, he'll be known in no time.

Apologies to those obvious dudes and ladies who I inevitably forgot. I'll update this as I remember more.

I'd love to hear your thoughts. Please cross post this to some other communities because I want to discover talent from other games, people that I've never heard of!

"	PleasantPeasant	16	5	57	"Personally, I have found the MOBA/aRTS scene so incredibly boring to watch. I actually play Dota2 everyday, but I can't force my self to watch a progame. 

My reasons are that the games are way too long, the fights are way too sporadic to be entertaining. In the end I feel like you're just watching someone last hit creeps and jungle. Dota2/LoL/HoN are all the same to me.  A lot of the time you can tell who's going to win by the 15th minute, and yet you're forced to watch more farming for an extra 30 minutes. "	t5_2r08k	True

The premise is that the game can't retain players because it is too difficult for new players. Also, so many people don't know about the game because Funcom is terrible at advertising (or something like that). 

What does /r/esports think the BLC community should do? Advertising paid for by the community? Resources created to help out new players? Competitions that are designed to help out new players? What do you think?

These questions and concepts are being thrown about quite a bit lately on various  blogs, forums, and from major icons in the 'eSports' industry. While the debate in some forms has been around for a while, from what I remember, the meta conversation began with an interview with [iplaywinner's 'Haunts' on ESFI World](http://esfiworld.com/sf4/feature/qa-haunts-iplaywinnercom) a few weeks back. This interview spawned an interesting debate on djWHEAT's pro-gaming show, [LiveOnThree Episode #64 @ ~57:00](http://ustream.tv/recorded/11277127). Since then, the subject has rippled through the internets with multiple posts on the subject @ [keekerdc's blog](http://keekerdc.com/), [on fnatic](http://fnatic.com/feature/8394/Is-eSports-a-bunk-term.html), and in the minds of its fans. 

I personally have no problem with the term - but then again, I am desperately striving for unity in 'eSports' or 'the term that shall not be named' communities of the world. But it is still a debate worth having, and hopefully resolving once and for all.

It’s reached a point where I need some opinions about the concept and implementation thus far. It’s a website dedicated to categorizing eSports content with the hope that users will be able to easily discover new players, teams, events, shows, etc. I’ve only implemented roughly 10-15% of the ideas I have laid out, but the core functionality is there.

In the future I want to take submitted data and not only allow people to browse it, but generate statistics automatically. That way we can answer questions like “who won the most prize money in X month?” “what team is currently the most liked in X game?” “which eSports show is the highest rated?” etc. simply by collecting an array of eSports data.

As I noted above, the site is still very young. I work on it entirely alone and there are many minor features missing. But I have spent hundreds of hours planning, developing, and exploring the concept (and associated endeavors), and plan on pursuing it for my foreseeable future (I’m a post-grad, non-drone, entrepreneur type).

Anyways, you can find the site at: http://www.spawnroom.com and there are some YouTube videos explaining the website and features here: http://www.youtube.com/user/spawnroom/videos

Spaceneil8	9	1	13	"I'm asking this question mainly because IEM is coming up and that is their format for the final day. Dreamhack set up the finals of SF4, Quake and SC2 back to back, and there was some noticeable backlash from the communities that don't want to watch other games, however, this type of setup is beneficial for cross pollination among the different communities, and it just helps people appreciate the broader esports scene.

The other setup is simply keeping the different games to their respective streams even for the finals. Generally, the finals for the different games tend to overlap on the same time slot so it's difficult to watch the finals for multiple games if you wanted to. However, there is very little complaint about this set up because people are generally watching for their one game.

I'm just wondering, which do you guys prefer? Do you like having the finals of every game back to back? Or do you like keeping the games within their own stream?"	t5_2r08k	True

The gameplay is heavily inspired by Jedi Knight 2. I'm in the beta because I donated to the development team's previous project, Dystopia, and they recently gave out extra beta keys to their supporters to give away.

I'm mainly looking for someone I can spar with. The game is a 1v1 dueling game, and it matches players in a server together based on a queue where the winner of a duel gets to continue and the first player in the queue is sent in to play against him. This means that a new player only ever really gets to play the best players in the server and even if there are players at his skill level in the server he will only very rarely see them... For example, [here's](http://imgur.com/8HUZG) an excerpt of a screenshot from the game's web stats system showing the expected outcomes of about half an hours worth of matches. ""5% lose"" doesn't mean ""95% win,"" by the way, 0% means a 50/50 chance of winning. So, I'm looking for a fellow noob or two to discover the game with."	t5_2r08k	True

I'm leaning towards [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdkDjsBiO58), which is the VOD from ESL where rapha sits down and talks his way through a game against cooler.

In addition, it displays notifications (if you enable it) whenever specified events come online. You can either add those events yourself, or say you want a list of standard events, which will then be fetched from my server, or both.

The events themselves are updated once an hour directly from teamliquid, so the info is always up-to-date.

Currently, it supports SC2, Dota2 and BW.

_______________
How to use

After installation, it should automatically open the options menu. If not, in chrome go to extensions -&gt; and then press options in touremind. For firefox, you need to right-click the addon button.

Once in the options menu, simply choose the games you wish to subscribe to. You can then add the events you want to be notified about in the textboxes, seperated by comma. The standard list of events is a good choice though, as it gives you everything that teamliquid lists as 'premier' or 'major' tournament, as well as teamleagues.

Dont forget to click save.

Current list of standard events:

**SC2**

wcs,iem,wcg,dh,hsc,state of the game,mlg,gsl,nasl,iron squid,eset,shoutcraft,gstl,proleague,teamstory cup, sc2l

**BW**

msl,osl,proleague,sospa

**DOTA2**

the international,premier league,alienware cup,super league

1364401962.0	1b4905	Unpublished interview I did with artosis about a year ago (xpost from /r/starcraft)	rabidbot	7	0	0	"Nothing to hard hitting in here, but a fun read. 



**I want to start of off saying thank you for time Artosis I know your busy leading nerds to the promised land.**


 **Ex-Brood War pro, new child, a wife, one the best commentators in the world, t-shirt mogul,upcoming video game character, talk show host, community leader, and king of nerds. How do you balance it all?** 

It's really hard to keep a balance. I just try my best to keep on top of things, and put in a lot of effort. Bad answer I know hahaha. I'll letcha know if I ever figure out how to have enough hours in the day to do what I need!



 **When you’re ahead, get more ahead. We hear you say this a lot on GSL broadcasts, would you say you live by this mantra?** 

I try to, but not always. There are plenty of times when I get bored (in real life, and in my games), and attack too quickly after getting ahead.



 **What has been the most enlightening thing about having a child and have you found a way to turn this into gaming prowess yet?** 

Out of all the things I've done in my life, I've normally only found real happiness//meaning in whatever I was competing in at the time (StarCraft, M:TG, Basketball, etc.). Now that I have a baby, I have more perspective. My passion for StarCraft has not diminished in the least, (infect it may be stronger than before, somehow....), but I've calmed down a lot. More patience with myself or something.


**With all these commitments jockeying for time in your life, do ever see yourself coming back to playing starcraft at high competitive level?** 

I always see myself doing that in some regard. Not that I ever plan to stop commentating or anything like that, but I always am working on my skill when I can. My ambitions regarding my playing career will not die until I do.



 **So it is finally happening, brood war and starcraft 2 scenes are colliding.  What do you find most exciting about this merger and what worries you most?** 

Nothing really worries me about it. I'm so excited to see the slight differences in styles and thought processes between the two scenes. It will also be awesome when some of the most talented and hardworking professional gamers of all time finally begin to catch up and play in the same tournaments as our current crop of top pros.



**I know it’s early, but by and far the most hyped player coming into sc2 is flash.  Do you think given time he will once again take his seat at the throne, and dominate sc2, or have we seen his peak in brood war?** 

If he wants to do it again, he obviously has the potential to reach the top again. The problem is, it will take years. Will he keep motivated in that time? It's hard to say.




**How big a deal is age really for competitive Starcraft 2?**

 
What matters is motivation. I hate people quoting ages as if they matter. Older players begin to have more on their mind, and other goals, so fall off.



 **How important is cross pollination (Koreans in international tourneys and foreigners in Korea) for esports?** 

Its pretty important. If no Americans or Europeans can compete on the world class scale, will new players think they can do it and join in? With no home-town (or country/region/whatever) heroes, will people from that region be as ready to embrace it as a sport? I would hope so, but I think it would hurt it.



 **Do you think oversaturation is possible in regards to Koreans in western tourneys?** 

It matters who the viewer is. Do you want top skill, or diversity in results/standings? One wants lots of Koreans, and one does not.



 **It seems like the western scene as a whole isn’t on the level of Korea’s. Is it just a matter of more focused and structured practice (i.e. team houses) or is the foreign scene missing something more that is holding it back from the korean level of success?** 

Ugh. It's a mixture of everything. Instead of saying what, in general, foreigners lack, let me say what Koreans do.

They live together.
They practice all day, every day.
They talk about the game together when they are not playing.
They don't think about what team will give them 500$ per month as opposed to 400$ per month. Most of them don't even make a dime.
They don't get angry when they lose. They type GG, ask for a regame, or queue up again.



 **If you had the power would you rather the starcraft scene be a collection of different sized tournaments or a more structured conglomerate , something like the NFL or NBA?** 

I'd like to see where it goes from here. I like having lots to choose from, I like all the different ideas coming in from different leagues, and I like how they all grow and improve due to the competition.


 
 **What excites you most for the next year in sc2?**

Just the opportunity to watch/play/cast more SC2 for at least one more year while making my living off of it!



 **What GSL player should the community be paying attention to that is currently flying under the radar?**

MVPSniper maybe. Damn did that guy make some insanely good decisions in his Code A matches!

 

 **Who is the best team in the GSTL**? 

Harder question than it seems! StarTale is on fire. IM looks like it should be called Invincible Monsters. Hell, I could go on and on! I just have no idea haha. I'll be watching closely.




 **How important is a crowd for live events?**

I think that the MLG Arenas have shown that its not 100% necessary. The crowd is amazing, but it brings a ton of costs in, so I really like that it's possible to have an event without it. Crowds to add amazing hype and a different feeling though!



**If aliens took tasteless to start the next version of earth where only sexy nerd ballers existed, who would you want to co-cast with?** 

I'm not really sure. Wheat and Husky come to mind pretty fast.




 **Are there any other games you have interest in casting or being involved with?** 

Kingdom Rush for the iPad. 73/75 stars right now! By the time you read this, I'll have them all though :D. Other than that, I love Street Fighter 4, as well as Plants vs Zombies.



 **So I sorta have to ask. Artosis pylon, it has worked its way into the lexicon of the sc2 community, thoughts?** 

Meh.



**It has been great, and once again thank you.  Any shout-outs?**

1339322517.0	uufsd	Things to be learnt from MLG	Braddowski	10	4	17	"Just a few things that I think MLG needs to build upon in future years about their general eSports coverage.

**NOTE:** This is an *opinion*. If you disagree, you're perfectly entitled to but these are just *my* thoughts on the subject.

* **Know Your Games**

Ok, so SC2 is what MLG was founded upon in reality so you can forgive them for not knowing so much about other games and their communities but there were some serious errors going on with the way MLG have run the Fighters &amp; LoL.

LoL is a long-running game - it can easily take over an hour. The schedule they'd set for which games would be streamed when led to some streaming channels being empty whilst others were running late. It also led to players not being given adequate set-up time &amp; them pushing on with the schedule whilst there were still technical difficulties.

Meanwhile, Fighters are meant to be crazy, fast-paced tournaments where everyone's essentially playing all at once but, instead, there were massive down-time gaps meaning we lost the energy of the tournament. *This* is the game where you should be pushing through competitors - not LoL.

The sad thing is, it could easily be solved if they'd spent more time talking to people involved in the communities &amp; who regularly run tournaments in these games. That being said...

* **Better Quality Casters**

I would've expected the Fighting &amp; LoL casters to raise these concerns pre-production. Whether they did &amp; weren't listened to, weren't given any pre-production briefings at all or just didn't want to rock the boat, I don't know. However I do know the SC2 casters did have some say in pre-production of SC2 as they were talking on Twitter about the partnerships they were looking forwards to &amp; how they said it'd be best if they didn't do certain things (TB asked to not do KeSPA, for instance).

Beyond even their pre-production input, the casters generally seemed a little... flat. The LoL casters seemed uncomfortable with the product-placement ads they were doing &amp; at times seemed to lose interest entirely - although with their workload in LoL, I don't blame them for being tired.

There needed to be more LoL casters &amp; possibly more than 2 doing any given game so it takes the pressure off of them for talking constantly for over an hour. The SC2 casters seemed to be better looked after as they had more breaks although this did mean that there were some odd mixes of casters that I didn't think worked. This is an issue with MLGs constantly but they need to match their casters personalities better if they're going to mix-up already established casting teams.

* **Increase the variety of games**

I normally watch SC2 &amp; the one thing I find really dull is when there's a match-up on both streams of a tournament &amp; you know nothing will happen or it's a fore-gone conclusion. This MLG, whenever that happened I was able to switch over to LoL or the Fighters &amp; something awesome would be happening!

Having 3 games with different pacing made for an excellent viewing experience &amp; if they fix the scheduling issues, it'd keep me interested for longer as I'd have a constant change of pace. Anaheim has made me want to save up &amp; head to the next MLG from where I live in Europe because, if I'm starting to find a game predictable, I could move to a completely new game where I have no expectations.

More games with varying pace is not only good for eSports but it's good for the viewer too.

* **Have more intensive rehearsals**

Some of the casters were arriving just the day before the event. There were technical issues with the streams the whole first day. Games would over-run or have massive down-time between them.

The amount of issues there have been for the viewer at home during this MLG could've been fixed by having a few days of rehearsals before the event

* **Better communication**

Some of the players on Twitter, in all 3 eSports, had issues with the lack of communication. Players not being allowed to use the bathroom, players being kicked out of the players area so they couldn't support their teammates... There needs to be better communication with the players as to what's happening, when &amp; why. If you're not going to allow bathroom breaks between games, say so. If eliminated players aren't allowed in the players area, say so.

Similarly, if you're having technical issues or scheduling issues, make it clear to the viewers what's happening. Sure, there'll be a little rage but more people'll be more understanding if they know what's happening.

This week: Mortal Kombat champion vVv Cdjr stops by to give us an interview about his experiences at MLG. What did he think of the event? Also, MLG SVP of Operations Adam Apicella makes an unannounced stop on the show to discuss everything from the FGC, to future MLG events, to arenas. This is an interview that is packed full of information. Listen in and give your feedback!
 
Next week we will be joined by Juicebox Abel to continue the discussion of Fighting Games and MLG.

* What makes Jerry say that we need to “police the bullshit?” (Time: 02:08:00)
* Will Call of Duty ever be fixed for competitive play? Will we ever see something done with the game? Also, what about Gears of War? Diablo III? Guild Wars 2? (Time: 02:17:00)
* Adam gives shoutouts and thanks. Josh does the same shortly afterward. (Time: 02:37:00)
* Show wrap up and a few great stories from MLG! Why did CheckSix send vVv Gaming two beat up cases of beer? (Time: 02:42:00)

1331091115.0	ql6p3	I've found ways to watch VoDs/replays of both the SC2 and LoL games from IEM WC in a spoiler-free setting. Is there any way to do so with CS1.6?	2xNoodle	7	1	10	"I want to watch this weekend's IEM, but go to school in USA and need to sleep/attend class during the broadcast hours, so I started looking for a way to watch the tourney in a spoiler-free method. After minimal searching, I've found that I can watch LoL broadcasts on [this](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF405DD0186E6F276&amp;feature=plcp) Youtube playlist or on [IEM's playlist](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL81839D41776748D1&amp;feature=plcp). For SC2 I can get replays [here](http://www.esl-world.net/masters/season6/hanover/news/187213/) (which sucks for those who don't have SC2 or access to a computer with it and because you don't get any commentary, but I guess it's better than nothing and they're technically supposed to add VoDs up there). 

But what can I do if I wanted to watch Counter Strike in a spoiler-free setting? I can't seem to find a way to do so; has anybody managed?


EDIT: 1.6 with Russian commentary can be found [here](http://de.twitch.tv/cyberarenatv/videos).

I'm a third year student majoring in Applied Psychology from the Netherlands. Specializing in the fields of (mental) coaching and training. And I'm looking into ways to make a meaningful contribution to the eSports scene, especially in ways where I can make use of my professional background.

Currently I only have some basic/minimal knowledge and understanding on how the eSports scene operates behind the curtains, therefore I'm trying to reach out in ways like this. Either to get in contact with people from the eSports scene, and/or to obtain more information about the eSports scene itself.

My inquiry to the /r/esports users is as follows: Could you help me by answering/giving your input on the follow questions regarding ""Coaching and eSports"" and possibly provide me with information or ways to obtain information on the eSports scene.

**Questions:**
Is there a possible need for professionals from my field(Applied Psychology) in the eSports scene?(Thinking in terms as coaching, (mental)health guidance, training.)

What is the view on ""Coaches"" from an eSports perspective, and what does the gaming scene think ""Coaches"" add/provide to their respective teams/players in the eSports scene?

I would also like more detailed information on how most professional teams/players, their sponsors/backers and management work together. (Does the ""pro gamer"" work all by himself, or are there more people involved in making things work out for the ""pro gamer""?)

I do have more questions I would like to discus/ask, but I will keep it like this for now.

With kind regards,
Koekjeerbij1

I've done lots of these long career interviews over my career, so I've divided them up into the three distinct phases of my career working with video, and put them in reverse chronological order for each section.  The first numbers on the left are when the interview was actually recorded.

**Phase 3 [March 2012 - now]**
===========
I just renamed the 'SK Gaming 1on1' feature to 'Grilled' when I joined Team Acer, in May of this year, since I didn't want any clashes with SK, in case they decided to continue the feature after my departure.

**Phase 2 - [May 2010 - January 2012]**
===========
Prior to that I took over the 1on1 feature, created by Carmac, during the last year and a half of my three year tenure as the EIC of SK Gaming.

When Carmac and TheSlaSH, my boss at SK, used to run that feature they tended to hover more around run times of 5-15 minutes, and the emphasis was to bring you the person outside of the server/game, their real life more than their gaming career.  I'd already done some long interviews before I took over the feature, so I gradually moulded it into the kind of feature 'Grilled' is now, doing longer interviews and going into great depth about people's careers.

The idea is to filter input so that only the best can contribute, and that makes plenty of sense on paper. However, some of the biggest movements that we see about changing games are the result of public complaints that resonate with the general public. When you take away an audience to judge the validity of things, I don't see how the discussions could be as useful, especially with the egos that top competitive players all have.

I could point to Nony's video [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Rqx8s2qKXM) for an SC2 example, or Volcano's blog [here](http://volcanotv.tumblr.com/post/28381324465/improving-the-spectating-experience-in-counter-strike) for another. Orb's article on the Warhound, Whisenhunt's video about weapon feedback/recoil in CS:Go, etc.

I'm curious how these discussions would change if you take these same forums and make them open for viewing to everyone, but keep the same exclusive group for posting. Thoughts?"	t5_2r08k	True

1340741079.0	vna8y	I don't think eSports will ever grow to the level of any of the international sports for a few reasons:	YouMad	24	18	24	"1) Volatility. Games come and go. Games change patch to patch, expansion to expansion.

2) There are too many games, the fan base is fractured. Even within a certain genre, the rules and mechanics are radically different between games (DOTA 2 / LOL, SC2 / BW).

3) Very complicated rules. Generally fans have to play the games to a semi-competent level before appreciating the pro-matches."	t5_2r08k	True
1340062257.0	v8z4m	I'm looking for a competitive game that isn't extremely time-consuming.		9	3	40	"I played warcraft 3/WoW/SC2 very competitively and became very good. But those games are too time-consuming, in WoWs case you need all the top items to be competitive and in SC2.. well.. that game is extremely complex and difficult. I was high masters/gm but I can't play that game anymore it's too frustrating/hard.

Due to those reasons, What games should I look at for a competitive game that has a level playing field (I.E. No grind before hand to PvP, such in WoWs case.)

I was looking at League of legends or DOTA 2. Which one is more popular/has more competition. How do you think guild wars 2 will be? "	t5_2r08k	True

The lead game designer on the game, David Jaffe, has expressed that he designed this game to be a competitive esport and hopes it can have a strong competitive scene.

Here's a few quotes by him:
""http://gamebattles.majorleaguegaming.com/ps3/twisted-metal/ Sweet! TM gets its very own Gamebattles/Major League Gaming page! While our game is not overflowing with unlocks and upgrades, we think our in the in the moment gameplay and the meta play within the actual battle itself is super strong. Seeing our baby on this site fills me with hope because- as I've said to the press- we really designed this game to be an esport and while the proof will most certainly be in the pudding, seeing this still gives me a thrill and makes me really excited for the game to go live in just 5 weeks!""

What are your guys' thoughts on the game? I think even if it doesn't have a big scene, it'll still be a lot of fun. Gamebattles should be interesting to play in too lol.
