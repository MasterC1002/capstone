1349985831.0	11brq4	TIL from r\gaymers that it's Coming Out Day. Then I learned that there are quite a few gaymers that can't come out without risking their own wellbeing. I'll be your mom for the day and give you the acceptance that you deserve. 	Diogenes71	2718	1045	681	"I'm a 41 year old mom of two teenage boys. My oldest is gay and has the full support of both of his parents and his brother. If your family won't accept you, in honor of the day, I will be happy to virtually adopt you if you want to come out to a family that will accept you no matter what. (BTW: I game when I have time, but life keeps me pretty busy. I follow this subreddit because it's important to my son and I like to keep up on the things that he cares about. It gives us more to talk about.)

Edit1: Some awesome person sent me Reddit Gold. I never had it before. I'm kinda diggin' it. Thanks, whoever you are!

Edit2: I have so enjoyed spending the day with all my adopted internet kids. Alas, I need to go to bed. Feel free to keep posting if you'd like and I'll follow up when I get off of work tomorrow. This has been a really amazing experience. Thank you all for your openess and for letting me be a part of your community for a little while. =)

Edit3: What an extraordinary thing to wake up to! I'm stunned. Thank you so much everybody for the kind words. I'm sorry I'm not going to have more time to respond to many of the posts until later tonight, but I will do my best. I've read throug several of the posts and many of them deserve a direct response. There are quite a few posts that share love and support to both me and the community. To those, you get my upvote and apprecection for helping make this the supportive effort that it has turned out to be. I'm no different than so many of you who have posted here. I'm just overwhelmed by the support shown here. ...and the flair? LOVE IT! I am truly honored. Now mom's gotta go to work. I look forward to hanging out with my ""family"" more later on.  Love you guys!

Edit4: Hi, ""kids""! I'm home... Dinner's in the oven, the dog has been fed, not-virtual kids are off to dad's for the weekend. Let's spend some time together. =) (Just to clarify, dad and I have been divorced for over 10 years. Our kids are our highest priority and we co-parent very well together. He lives less that a mile up the street. I hope you're not too disappointed by that.)

Edit5: Grammar. Thanks, Baron. You're the Gaymer I'm going to count on to tell me when I have spinach in my teeth. 

Edit6: For anybody who is still paying attention, please check out [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaymers/comments/11brq4/til_from_rgaymers_that_its_coming_out_day_then_i/c6ld2nq)  Thesunnysam may not realize it, but he's? using a technique used in hypnosis in his post. His response mentally primes the receiver to accept the message being heard. You may want to incorporate it into your approach when you share the ""news.""

Final Edit: ...aaaand, I'm done. It think I got to everybody, some with just an upvote, but I read everything. There are a few exceptions to my upvoting, but some folks seemed to miss the point of what we were trying to do here. Thank you all so much. I am humbled by the awesomeness and support I saw here over the past two days. I'll respond to PMs if you'd like to share something, but I think I'm done with this particular thread.

1347242918.0	zmrfh	Gaymers could be banned and deleted by tomorrow, please FUCKING READ!	MisterGhost	2606	1169	691	"Ladies and gentlemen, this is incredibly important, and quite frankly too important for a TLDR, so please read.

Someone wants to take gaymers from us. A cease and desist letter has been sent to Reddit. It would seem that the owner of gaymer.org is an incredible douchenozzle and has decided that we somehow are infringing upon his right to run a very subpar blog. Though Gaymercon seems to be A-OK. It seems pretty fucked up that they seem to be ok using the same GAYMER name, even though we aren’t making money. See what it is, is that this motherfucker from gaymer.org is sending reddit a cease and desist letter that we are using a name that he had trademarked in 2007 though whoever gave him that trademark is clearly not the brightest lightbulb in the box. It is a general term, not really sure how we fucking come into play.

Now here is this dude’s trademark: 

&gt; IC 042. US 100 101. G &amp; S: Computer services, namely, creating an online community for registered users to participate in competitions, showcase their skills, get feedback from their peers, form virtual communities, engage in social networking and improve their talent; Computer services, namely, hosting and maintaining an online website for others to discuss, receive and disseminate information concerning video games; Computer services, namely, hosting on-line web facilities for others for organizing and conducting online meetings, gatherings, and interactive discussions. FIRST USE: 20030526. FIRST USE IN COMMERCE: 20030526

Now clearly this is fucking ridiculous in terms of his claim against Gaymers, and is demonstrated so.

1. Reddit doesn't require registered users, you can be anonymous.  
2. We do not showcase skills or participate in competitions.  
3. It is engaging in social networking, but not to improve talent. The first part of the registration clearly shows that this is a site for gay gamers to focus on games. This subreddit is about the subculture of gaming within the context of being gay. The goals are different.  
4. Lastly, the trademark office does not allow you to register what is called Descriptive Trademarks. That means, for instance, you can't register Grocery Store for a grocery store.

It would be easy for us to argue that gaymers is just descriptive of Gay Gamers and is just descriptive mark and not some sort of corporate logo or trademark. Now if anyone has any question in regards to this claim: I am sure that the gentleman sending the cease and desist, who is bringing these claims against us would be happy to answer the questions of you 16,000 gaymers. 

 I am sad, sure, I will be honest, I’m not the happiest guy around. However, you dudes have become happy. People I know have improved their lives, RedditHolmes has gotten married to a gaymer for fucks sake, people have gotten jobs, even some of you have confided in me the want to commit suicide, unless I or someone else convinced you otherwise. Guys, Ladies, and everyone else, this is bullshit, IT IS NONSENSE, quite frankly FUCK THIS ENTIRE LEGAL ENDEAVOR. Reddit will not help us, neither will anyone else. The estimate I got for defending us legally would be above 50k dollars, and honestly since I was begging for food and money trying to pay for gaymers mumble, I don’t think that we are gonna be able to get the money needed.

Here is what I need gaymers, I want you guys to subscribe to /r/internauts. The reason I have selected that particular name is because Mason Wyler suggested it, and it made me giggle SO DEAL. So anyway we may have to transplant not only to this subreddit, but also to offsite, I am open to names what we would call it, but understand that I am devoted to making a better community for you guys. I would have made a video speaking what I thought about, but I am far too prideful to show that, maybe someday I will be a bit different,  anyway, join the new subreddit, fuck gaymer.org and have a great night.

1347243685.0	zms9y	/r/gaymers may be banned as early as Monday Morning. Here is what we, the /r/gaymers mods, know	MrPookers	752	142	229	"TL;DR: shit’s goin’ down, y’all! r/gaymers might be banned this week over a cease and desist letter from someone who claims to have trademarked the word “gaymer.” Please subscribe to /r/internauts where we will regroup.

You’ve probably read [MisterGhost’s announcement](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaymers/comments/zmrfh/gaymers_could_be_banned_and_deleted_by_tomorrow/) regarding gaymer.org’s cease &amp; desist letter served to Reddit. In this post, we the mods are sharing the information we have in as clear, concise, and unbiased language as we could muster.

Citizens, our situation is dire: The term “gaymer” was trademarked in 2007 and its holder, the owner of www.gaymer.org, has served Reddit a Cease &amp; Desist letter. We are not, and have never been, affiliated with that website. Since we cannot change the name of r/gaymers, complying with the trademark would require that **all** of the gaymers subreddits be removed, and with them, all existing posts and comments.

We do have a viable case for our use of the term, if this matter were to go to court. Primarily, “gaymer” is a word which cannot be legitimately trademarked to begin with. Ideas cannot be trademarked, nor can widely used generic names for things. This is why certain corporations, while striving for market dominance and ubiquity of their products, stress that their brand names not be confused with the general product as a whole. For example: Band-Aid doesn’t sell band-aids, it sells Band-Aid brand bandages. LEGO doesn’t sell lego, it sells LEGO blocks. You don’t wipe your nose with kleenexes, but with Kleenex brand tissues. The distinction is important because if all commercially sold bandages became widely known simply as band-aids, Band-Aid would lose the trademark to its own name. Anyone could call their bandages “band-aids.”

Here’s an example of the term “gaymer” being used [in 1997 in a Usenet post](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rec.games.computer.ultima-dragons/xzYw8LRJ7Og/zO8K7wXWxcYJ) as a descriptive term for a gay gamer. Here’s [another example](http://www.gamegrene.com/node/216) in a blog post from 2002. The term “gaymers” is a purely descriptive term for “gay gamers”, it’s commonly used online in a context completely unrelated to the trademark, and purely descriptive terms cannot be trademarked. This trademark shouldn’t have been granted in the first place; it was invalid then, and it is invalid now.

In our case, we could argue that “gaymer” is naturally a descriptive word for what a gay gaymer *is*, and that the trademark should be revoked. Riding this case to court, however, could require moneys on the order of $50,000. We don’t have that money, and contesting the trademark is the only way to truly free the word “gaymer” for gay gamers everywhere.

When you’re angry, the desire to demonize people is strong. Know, though, that everyone here is doing what they *have* to do. Reddit isn’t invested in its subreddits enough to launch an expensive legal battle to protect a few of them. The trademark’s holder *has to* ask Reddit to stop violating its trademark, because it’s legally his responsibility to see that it is enforced. If you’re like us, you’re angry about this bullshit situation. We must not, however, let it devolve into a witchhunt. Petitioning Reddit on this, or blaming Reddit for this are not viable or recommended efforts. Our goal, as always, is to make the world a better place.

Confusingly, gaymer.org has [expressed support](http://www.gaymer.org/index.html/_/homophobia/gaymercon-r53) for Gaymer**Con** ([imgur screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/tFdZr.png)). We do not, however, know anything else about their interactions.

Where do we go from here? MisterGhost has set up /r/internauts as a sort of refugee camp/potential new home. We don’t know how this week will to play out. For all we know the admins will destroy all the gaymer subreddits outright on Monday morning, or they might figure out a way to change the names for us. We don’t even know what powers they have at their disposal or when they will choose to wield them.

Finally, beware: much personal information of the trademark’s owner is *dangerously* exposed online and you must take care not to link to it anywhere on Reddit, especially as there may be a great deal of hostility towards him. Linking to it counts as doxxing, and may get offenders shadowbanned. Please do not abuse him. Remember: we want his good will. He may be able to tell Reddit to let us call ourselves gaymers.

If reddit complies with this cease and desist order, /r/gaymers and its entire history of posts and comments could be destroyed. In the nearly two years of its existence, we’ve had a [gift exchange](http://redd.it/n9ybx) and [meetups](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaymers/comments/vvnjm/chicago_gaymers_meetup_2012_group_pic/) that have brought together hundreds of gaymers [all over the world](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaymers/search?q=meetup+OR+meatup&amp;restrict_sr=on), spawned [guilds](http://www.reddit.com/r/wowgaymers) and [corporations](http://redd.it/roxu1)† and [brought two gaymers together in an actual, real-life marriage](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaymers/comments/usnlh/for_my_cake_day_holmes_and_my_wedding_rings/). We have built a *very real community* here. They can take the name gaymers from our subreddit, we can’t fight that battle legally — **but we have to keep our history**.

1358960077.0	174ooy	Update!  /r/gaymers is fighting back; the Trademark Issue	ozuri	724	133	87	"Ok reddit, this post is going to be long and I apologize in advance for the wall of text that is forthcoming.  Skip to the bottom for the tl;dr.

Gaymers worldwide have reached out to support us since we were sent a copy of the Cease and Desist from gaymer.org.  We thank you for your support.

My name is Zack and the /r/gaymers mods have asked me to step up as a mod, temporarily, to help manage the project that we are undertaking.  I've been involved in intellectual property for the majority of my career and this particular case hits home for me.  

First, some clarification -- the field of intellectual property generally contains 3 main pieces: trademark, copyright, and patent.  I'm not going to touch on patent law since that’s not involved here.
 
People often confuse trademark and copyright, so a brief explanation.  Copyright is, essentially, for the protection of an author’s writings.  You cannot copyright an idea, only the means of expressing it, “fixed in a tangible medium of expression.”  Copyright automatically inheres at the moment of creation, you don't have to register it, but it helps if you do.

Trademark law, on the other hand, is about protecting the consumer.  The law is meant to keep consumers from being confused as to the source of particular goods or services.  Trademarks are words, symbols, etc that refer to particular brands of goods. Trademark protection is supposed to ensure that consumers can trust that the goods and services they buy come from the sources they expect, e.g., that the Pepsi you just bought really was manufactured by Pepsi.  That helps consumers, because it gives mark-owners an incentive to maintain the expected level of quality. And it helps mark-owners because they can build customer loyalty and good will.  

To be protectable, however, a trademark must be distinctive, so that consumers will identify it with a particular brand of service.  For example, Apple is protectable for computers and phones.  The law won’t protect words or phrases that are generic (e.g. “apple” brand apples) or merely descriptive (e.g. “red” brand apples). 

Personally, I rely on intellectual property law for my livelihood.  I work in video games and my career benefits directly from the existence and enforcement of trademark and copyright law (though I am acting here simply as an individual and do not represent my company in any fashion).  So I’m not someone who is anti-intellectual property protection.  For me, digital IP protection is about not penalizing creative people in the digital space simply because they lack the ability to protect their ideas the same way they can in the physical world.  I also believe that spurious claims like the one asserted by gaymer.org undermine the legitimacy of the system and give breath to a vocal group of individuals who believe that the system is inherently broken.

Second, reddit is not a haven for trademark infringement.  They will not protect you if you infringe a trademark.  But this case isn't about infringement, it's about harassment and the enforcement of an illegitimately granted trademark.  Specifically, we believe that an entity should not be allowed to co-opt a group's identity for personal enrichment, power, or ego.  

So the actions we have taken are not because we don’t believe in intellectual property protection.  They are because we believe the term “gaymer” is a word that should remain in the public domain, free for use and not “owned” by any particular individual or organization.
  
See, I'm older than most of you, and I grew up in an age when being a nerd was not a synonym for tech savvy entrepreneur with a high-paying job at Google; it meant social stigma, awkward interactions with peers and coming in last on the day we ran laps.  Coupled with the crippling anxiety of being gay (and for me, being from an evangelical Christian background), being a gay nerd who loved video games was the proverbial hat trick of otherness.  

Through the passage of time and the ubiquity of technology, nerds have come to claim our place at the table of industry.  Through the work of tireless individuals and organizations, the gay community has made significant progress in removing the venom of social stigma from our minority community.  It is the reclamation of our differentness from being a pejorative that we have found some peace as a community.  For me, it is the marrying of my hobby and a part of my identity that allowed me to grow into my own as an adult.  I am a gaymer.

Mr. Vizzini, you keep using the word 'gaymer.'  I do not think it means what you think it means[.](http://imgur.com/SE5AUd0)

To the rest of us, it means community.  It means pride in our differentness and our small community.  It means inclusiveness rather than exclusiveness.  It means banding together and using a common hobby – games – to unite a sub-set of our community that otherwise has nothing substantive in common.  It bridges the gap in the gay community of an arbitrary characteristic with an activity that allows commonality, of purpose and activity.  In short, it is the antithesis of a claim of ownership and threats to exclude or demands to capitulate.

Many people have pointed out that “gaymer” was in common use well before it was registered with the Trademark Office; from Yahoo Groups, to USENET forum posts, to academic studies on our little community -- heck, my own Match.com profile is [gaymer77]( http://www.match.com/profile/Show?UID=RUh7eU1gE7jym7hTbt7w7g%3D%3D&amp;amp;Handle=gaymer77).  Claiming ownership of the word gaymer is like claiming to own 'soccer mom,' 'baby boomer,' or 'computer geek'.  

And so, on behalf of the reddit gaymer community, we have engaged the law firm of [Perkins Coie](http://www.perkinscoie.com) to pursue this matter on our behalf and they are representing us [pro bono](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_bono).  Yesterday afternoon we filed a petition with the Trademark Office to cancel the “Gaymer” trademark registration.  The lawyers working with us there are: [Judy Jennison](http://www.perkinscoie.com/jjennison/), [Will Rava]( http://www.perkinscoie.com/wrava/), [Alex Garcia]( http://www.perkinscoie.com/ajagarcia/), [Jeff Nelson](http://www.perkinscoie.com/jnelson) and [Nicola Menaldo]( http://www.perkinscoie.com/nmenaldo/).  Believing in the rightness of our cause and the righteousness of what we are attempting to do, the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](http://www.eff.org) has signed on as co-counsel.  Spearheading the EFF effort, and frankly, the person who has helped make this happen is the Director of Intellectual Property at the EFF, [Corynne McSherry](https://www.eff.org/about/staff/corynne-mcsherry) together with her colleague, [Julie Samuels](https://www.eff.org/about/staff/julie-samuels).  

Further, reddit has expressed their emotional and moral support.  And while this is not their fight, they believe that we are in the right and have expressed their desire for us to find success.  

Lastly, if you, or someone you know, has received a demand letter in connection with gaymer.org please reach out to us, we'd love to talk to you.

Bullying is bad enough when it's from someone outside the community, but it is so much worse when it comes from within.

Thanks, and game on, gaymers.

So, I live in Washington D.C. Two years ago, I moved there for a job on Capital Hill after I finished college.

And I have just entered a 'relationship' (we're not defining it...) with my childhood bully who tormented, abused, and teased me since I was seven. 

When I was in elementary school, I was 'that kid' who didn't have many friends and was usually the last to be picked for gym or group projects. I was a nerd who loved reading books, playing video games and generally keeping to myself. Noone really bothered me that much other than a few kids who quickly grew bored when I didn't respond to their taunts.

Until a new student transferred to our school. And on the first day during lunch, he decided to become the source of my pain, low self-esteem and frustration for the next 10 years.

I don't know why he chose me to be his victim but a suffering victim of his I became. Every day at school, he would taunt me, hurl insults and physically accost me in the classroom without nary a teacher catching wind of it. Even as a kid, he was very charming and witty to the adults. He won them over quickly with his boyish good looks and sense of humor that seemed beyond his years. So whenever, I complained or told my teachers about what he did to me, they assumed I was lying and my classmates would back him up. He was popular and well-liked. And I wasn't.  

One time during a dodgeball game, he threw a ball so hard at my face that he broke my nose. He wasn't punished and I was laughed at for being gross while I sprouted blood from nose in fountains....

He was the first person to ever call me a fag.

When high school rolled around, I had hoped that he had matured enough to stop harassing me. And dear god he had. I'm sure it was a combination of summer lacrosse camp and puberty, but  he had turned into an Adonis. And just my luck I turned out to be gay. 

He knew I was. And he knew that I now had a newfound attraction to him. And he was more than willing to use it against me. His antagonistic behavior was no longer physical but purely verbal. His sociopathic flirtations with me in the gym locker room (with him often completely nude...) were meant to arouse me and make feel like sh*t. He outed me to the entire school and I was hurled every homophobic insult there is for years.  

The stress of the bullying and coming out finally got to me and I was checked into a mental clinic for suicidal behavior. It's the only time the school finally stepped in and told my bully stop and cease all contact with me. 

For the last two years of high school, I was ostracized for 'telling lies' about their all-star lacrosse hero. But I found the peace and resolve to graduate high school salutatorian. I didn't attend high school prom. I was accepted into New York University. My bully of course just had to be smarter than me and graduated at the top of his class and attended Yale.

In college, free from my bully, I was allowed to blossom. I made friends. I developed a personality other than stoic. I partied. I laughed. I had sex with guys solo, threesome and even an orgy once. I lost the glasses and got contacts. I went to the gym and developed a dancer's body. I learned how to dress with the latest fashions. I tried ecstasy and weed. I gain confidence and articulation that I never had. I let loose. I was free to be me.

Until, I saw him at Nellie's, a gay sportsbar in D.C., getting a drink with his friends. After six years of peace, there he was, in front of me, apparently gay, having a drink. I never bothered to look for him on Facebook (why would I?) and my FB name was not my real name so it was difficult to find me there. I didn't have any friends from high school on FB either. 

All of a sudden I was that little boy again. I turned to retreat and get the hell out of there but he saw me and intercepted my path. Smiling. Friendly. Like we were the best of pals. He was new in town. Working at a law firm. Meeting new people. Some of those new people were MY friends. 

It was happening all over again. He was going to take all that I worked hard for in one fell swoop. And he was gay! The entire time he called me 'fag' and outed me to everyone in high school, he was a fag himself!

I left the bar without saying a word to him and swore to never see him again. Which was impossible. If there are any gaymers in D.C., you know that the gay community in DC is small; everybody knows everybody.

And with his good looks (which improved astoundingly over the years), charming personality, ridiculously good body and six figure salary, it didn't take much for him to become 'popular' with the gays. 

I tried to avoid him but he was everywhere. At Nellies. At Town. At Cobalt. EVERYWHERE. Finally, he managed to corner me at a house party sitting on the couch trying desperately to get drunk, and asked me why I was avoiding him. I looked at him as if he were some kind of retard and blew up on him. Everything I had wanted to say to him, I let it all out. All 10+ years of it. 

And then we fucked. I don't know how it happened. But after my epic drunken blow-up (which the gays called the diva grenade), I was somehow lured to his condo, and he fucked my ass like a piston. And it was really, really hot. And it was really, really good. And we did it twice at night and twice in the morning. 

And now we have this...thing where we have great sex and we go to movies together and even have dinner together.

I don't what the fuck happened. 

I'm dating my childhood bully. He made me want to kill myself when I was a teenager. I should hate him. But now it's...murky.

Am I crazy?

Advice?

However, now I think I have ESP.

Fast forward to my lovely bf coming home from work. He said lets go to dinner, and just have a nice night out (a rarity as we both have weird hours). We went to one of my favorite places (P.F. Chang's noms) and were just enjoying our night out. He then became very serious and said ""I need to ask you something, and I want you to be honest with me."" I got scared. Did I do something, did I hurt his feelings OH GOD OH GOD (I'm jewish, neurosis is part of our make-up). He then got on one knee in the middle of the restaurant opened this little box and said ""Will you spend the rest of your life with me?""

Fellow gaymers, I was floored. I love this man more than anyone I ever have before. In the two years I've spent with him, i've never been more fulfilled in my life. Of course, I said yes.

However, to keep /r/gaymers from getting clogged up with them, I present to you two options:

1. Post your costume pic to /r/GaymersGoneMild for link karma.

OR

2. Post your costume pic here.

I tried this [earlier,](http://redd.it/1263ax) but that post didn't get upvoted/visibility, so self-pic-posts started running rampant anyway.

I'm not trying to oppress you. It's just that many users are going to start downvoting these posts *en masse,* and your beautiful face and handiwork might get terribly unappreciated. Where we go from here is up to you.

Also: if you want this thread to conglomerate lots of self-pics, upvote it! It's a self-post so I don't get karm for it!

After years of bewilderment, of fighting against myself, of trying to change myself, of just closing up to everyone dear to me and of nearly giving up and just leaving this world, I have finally accepted who I am, and it's GLORIOUS. I am gay. Ugh, it feels so good to say it! My name is Diego, I'm from Venezuela but I live and breathe America, and I'm done not being me. I love videogames, I am studying to become an aerospace engineer, I love to read and watch TV and I like boys. I will now dump this charade, this farce, and start living the life I want, and I won't let anyone drag me down. This weekend I'm coming out to my sister, whom I love and whom I feel will be most understanding, and I look forward to a life that is my own. I love you all!

1347301824.0	znxn0	GayGamer.net supports /r/gaymers	anonymike	384	44	68	"Back in 2006 my dear friend Flynn DeMarco, aka Fruit Brute, approached me about helping him create a site for gay gamers.  As an avid reader of Kotaku and Destructoid, he had previously approached gaymer.org's Chris Vizzini about including more game journalism on his site.  He was rejected, so he talked with me about how to setup [GayGamer.net](http://gaygamer.net).  We soon discovered that while we were also criticized about the need for a gay gamer site by the larger gamer community, our site exploded overnight.  There was definitely an unfilled need for game journalism from a gay perspective.

We were frankly flabbergasted when Vizzini trademarked gaymer.org and were worried that he might try to shut down GayGamer, but we were thankfully spared such actions.  Our two sites are actually quite different, but we wondered if we needed similar protections.  However trademarks are expensive, and our legal counsel agreed that it didn't make sense to pursue trademarks at that time.  Sure, maybe eventually if we continued on our explosive growth over time, but things plateaued.  The Internet is constantly evolving.  GayGamer still serves a close knit community, but we aren't trying to corner the market.  I'd like to think that we identified a need and were instrumental in helping our wider community gain respect from game publishers.

When I first heard about the cease and desist letter, I couldn't help but wonder if this was a purely financially motivated event.  Conde Nast has deep pockets, and Vizzini has a standing trademark on the term gaymer for use in social media websites.  However, I certainly wouldn't want to be in Vizzini's shoes right now.  I've dealt with keeping the GayGamer servers up when we hacked by haters looking to shut us down.  At that time, Kotaku really took a stand on our behalf and called foul on the haters.  We've managed to hold the status quo ever since.  Hopefully that means that people's views are expanding, and we're no longer the target that we once were.  However, the backlash against Vizzini appears to be very different in its nature.  As we can already see, his site has been suspended due to the incredible traffic generated by Reddit.  While Reddit cannot be held responsible for the actions of its users, I fear Vizzini may have opened a pandora's box ultimately dooming his site.

My hope is that Vizzini will reconsider his tactic and allow things to cool off.  There is room for diversity.  People like to hop between communities.  Sites like Reddit can drive incredible traffic to a site which in turn translates to increased ad sales, but if you piss everyone off, you're going to be taken down which means no ad revenue at all.  Anyway, as one of the co-founders of GayGamer and also as a Redditor, I wanted to say that GayGamer supports Reddit in this fight and condemns the actions of Vizzini."	t5_2s9n5	True

I answered. She was in tears freaking out just screaming ""WHY WHY WHY"" over and over. When she finally calmed down, she informed me that I had left my shit logged in on my grandmother's computer so she of course decided to read through all my Facebook messages, including the ones between me and my fiancee.

The conversation went on a really long time but it involved her screaming at me that I'm going to Hell, calling me an abomination, saying that this was her worst nightmare, saying that she'd rather me be a murderer or an unwed father, saying that she didn't want to hear from me again until I could pay her back the $200 she lent me, which means I'll be spending my birthday familyless. I tried to tell her I was still her son and I still loved her and she just told me that was bullshit, and that she was going to call my dad and tell him, and my sister, and was going to go back inside at my grandparents' house and tell them as well.

I've been hysterical. I called my friend's parents who also happen to be pastors and know that I'm gay and she cried on the phone with me and told me that she didn't necessarily think it was ""God's Plan"" for my life but that didn't mean she couldn't love me, or love my fiancee, or even accept us for who we are. She said she would reach out to my mother and try to calm her down, and I told her that was a good plan since my mom probably needed someone in a religious position such as her to make her finally calm down.

I'm just cold and empty. My mother has said she doesn't want contact with me. She said to tell my boyfriend she hates him and never in her life wants to meet him, which means no real family. It means I'll be spending my birthday without my family (Wednesday), my graduation without my family (May), my first job, holidays...

I'm just at a loss. Good thing I have lots, and lots, and lots of beer."	t5_2s9n5	True

When I asked him his whole face lit up and immediately said yes. We had a great time together and when we talked he said he had always felt the same about me. We've only technically been going out for a few days but already when talking about us we always go on little tangents about marriage and growing old together. He's the sweetest person in the world and I can't wait to see where we will go.

Today I finally actually said ""I'm gay"""	bunsofcheese	286	39	29	"I'm home visiting and in the four days that I've been here, and for the first time ever, I actually said ""I'm gay"" to my mother.  It was a bit on a non-event to her, but I'm glad I said it.

We've had a few intensely awesome conversations, one of which left me feeling a bit of regret.

She asked me why I didn't tell her and Dad sooner, and I told her I was scared to lose her.  She rolled her eyes a little and said ""Dear, we always knew - and I can guarantee you your father would have been fine with it.""

But the conversation that blew me away was when she told me how in grade nine - this was 1979, and I'd like to add in a small fishing town on the east coast - I was going around telling my classmates and teachers that I was gay.  Apparently during the first parent - teacher meeting of the year that year, one of the teachers took my parents aside and told them this, then told them to get me to stop.  My parent's reaction?  

""No, we won't tell him to stop.  he's expressing himself.""

I now have a completely different opinion of my parents, and I regret not saying anything sooner.

do yourself a favour - don't wait for your parents to ask you if you're gay.  When it feels right, talk to them - they're not blind to these things, believe me.

oh - to make this gaymer-related, I'm currently playing Limbo, and it's awesome."	t5_2s9n5	True

Trust me.	johnnyqdoe	289	44	66	"I'm a young 33, was a virgin until 27, and I'm a bit tired of people using throwaway accounts to say that being a virgin is embarrassing or that they feel old or that they will be forever alone. So, true to my flair, I present you this:

* Age: **You certainly aren't old if you're under 40**. I honestly don't think you're old until 60s and even then I've met some amazingly young 65+ers. You might have times you feel old, or act old. But those are mindsets that can be changed, and aren't even inherently bad.  
* Virginity: Guys, losing your virginity to an asshat at a young age is going to be emotionally rough and frustrating. Holding on to it for a while increases the chances that you're emotionally prepared to do it with someone special your first time. Not 100%, but increased. **Also, sex can be fun, great and amazing; it can also be shitty, boring, regretful and, without protection, can cost your life. Do not idealize sex, do not diminish the value of waiting.** There is a balance for you.  
* Being single: it's not the end of the world. I have a belief that the more awesome you are, the longer it takes the Universe to conspire to have you meet someone on the same awesomeness level. I'm 33 and I just met the first guy I've ever really felt was a good fit. I've had my lonely times, I've had my crying times, but I've also **strove to be happy when single**. Being depressed and/or desperate is a great way to remain depressed and/or desperate. Be happy with who you are; you'll find the lads and ladies are more drawn to a happy, unique, sincere individual.  
* You will be fine. Period. You will be **fine**. Have faith in that.  
* But, if you can't be 100% okay with it, then **be the person you want to date**. Not saying you should clone yourself, but find the points that you don't like about yourself, and work to change them. Hate that you're a smoker, work to quit smoking. Tired of being lethargic? Hit up /r/fitness or /r/running or something and pick up a hobby. Develop those things that make you special or at least make you happy.  
* Along those lines, if you do want to meet someone, **find a group that does the things you like**: church groups, hobby groups, fitness groups, hell, drinking groups. Any person you meet there already has one major thing in common with you. 
* If you have issues and need someone to talk to, I'm here, MisterGhost is here, **there are 15k+ other people who are here**, and I'm sure some of them are assholes, but you really only need a few (need proof? look up the self post I put up this week).  
* This isn't to undermine what you feel, just trying to give you some perspective from someone who's been there. And honestly, I have the upmost faith that **you will be fine, if you aren't already are**.  
* And until then, much &lt;3 from Sir-List-A-Lot  "	t5_2s9n5	True

You *may* remember me as that guy who thought up (but not the only one who helped execute) the 2011 wintertime gaymer gift exchange. [Here's a picture](http://i.imgur.com/ITQji.jpg) for reference. (I went by ""Bedbug"" on the mumble/tinychat.)

Anyway, I disappeared around the time for rematching (which I really hope ended up happening. Sorry for dropping the ball on that one).  Here's why:

For the last 18 months, I have been battling an eating disorder as a new symptom to reoccurring depression.  Four months ago, I unsubscribed from /r/gaymers and many other subreddits that I loved because visiting them had become so painful.  Every time I logged in, my frontpage was plastered with unrealistic expectations of what my body should look like and what my genitals should resemble. I had had enough.

Little did I know at the time, unsubscribing was one of the first steps I took toward recovery.  Just not being surrounded (as much) by all the sexy nude and semi-nude bodies made my life worlds better, despite missing the community I had done so much to propagate.  In the last four months I've made lots of strides to make myself a healthier person:

* I moved, including painting my new room and my old furniture
* Started a farm around my apartment with my new roommate.  We have almost thirty different varieties of fruits, vegetables, and legumes as well as four baby chickens.
* Got back into therapy.  I found a specialist that I can walk to from my house.
* Surrounded myself with supportive people that I can talk to who also feel comfortable enough to talk to me about their issues.
* Turned recovery into a game with [SuperBetter](https://www.superbetter.com/).  SuperBetter is for [gamification](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2N-5maKZ9Q) of any life goal (fitness, depression, quitting smoking, etc.)  You guys'll like it.

These combined with other recovery behaviors have helped me become resilient enough to return to communities filled with content I once found so triggering.  It's good to be back.

&gt; *But potator, /r/gaymers isn't your personal facebook!*

I decided to share my story with you for a very important reason.  Disordered eating is a *community* problem in gay culture.  Gay and bisexual men are *three times* more likely to suffer symptoms of anorexia, bulimia, or binge eating disorder than their heterosexual counterparts.  This means that roughly 15% of the gay and bi male community are suffering from the mental illness with **the highest mortality rate** of any mental illness. Being male with an eating disorder can feel incredibly marginalizing because almost all resources for the disorder are targeted toward women.  You are not alone.  Help is out there, you just have to find it.

If you or someone you know needs help with disordered eating, I cannot urge enough how important treatment is *right now*.  Reddit also has a troll-free subreddit, r/EDRecovery, for people recovering from eating disorders. Send [a PM to emmster](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=emmster) for access to the community.

And since I've missed four months here, it seems appropriate to repost [Gaymers Cider](http://www.airsngraces.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/gaymers-cider1.jpg)."	t5_2s9n5	True
1328723329.0	pghwb	Gaymers: I Have Finally Accepted That I Am A Bottom.	TeenageDarren	335	96	159	"Today, I finally accepted myself as a bottom after years of lying, deceit and self-denial.

As a person who is 6' feet tall and an avid bodybuilder, everyone assumes that I am top. I don't blame them. I look like a top should. 

And the guys I've dated, all assumed I was top. I had to be! I couldn't be the bottom! It would just look wrong!

So, I held up the facade of being a strict top for years. I'd tell my friends. I'd tell my dates. I'd tell my father who was happy to know that I was the 'man' in the relationship.

And when I do bottom for a guy (who is usually either disappointed or turned on to top a muscled guy) I make them swear to secrecy. 

But all along? LIES. LIIEEEEEEESSSS.

I like to be fucked. HARD. 

Fast and slow. Missionary and doggy style. On the bed or in the shower.

Nothing feels better to me than having my legs in the air, the guy gripping my ankles and pounding away at my prostate till there's no tomorrow.

It just feels GOOD.

I've done topping. Not my cup of tea. I mean, there were some waify twinks that I did relatively enjoy topping...but all the time my ass was wanting for some cock. 

My condomed dick in an ass just does not feel as good as condomed dick in MY ass.

So, I am coming out! 

As a bottom! 

I refuse to be ashamed of being a bottom anymore!

Anyone else overcoming their shame or embarrassment of being a bottom?
