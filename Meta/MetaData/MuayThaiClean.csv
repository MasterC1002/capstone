1365665023.0	1c4f6a	When to fight.	Muaythaisouthpaw	60	4	51	"Hey r/muaythai. Tonight at open sparring at my gym, two guys came in roughly 20 minutes late to spar. Neither of them had ever come to our gym before, but they said that they teach out of a different gym farther away. Right away I noticed they were sparring at almost 100% against our guys. I told one of them to settle down and that we don't go that hard, he smiled, said sorry, but little changed. I paired up with him next and as soon as the round started he threw an overhand right for the fences missing me by an inch. I told him again, ""If you go hard I am going to go just as hard back"". He kept going hard so I threw in a few hard shots to match his intesnity. After an exchange he covered up so I backed off. as I was walking away from him (my back to him, yes rookie mistake) he threw a jumping spinning back kick nearly knocking my head off. luckily it missed. I got a bit angry at this and just rushed him for the last 20 seconds teeing off and didn't spar with him again. 
Throughout the night I saw that they were both still going 100% with our guys. Then the bigger more experienced guy paired up with my coach. He started nice and easy at a good level but out of the blue went 100% bat shit crazy! Throwing jumping knees at my coaches head repeatedly, jumping spinning back kicks, axe kicks, flashy stuff that could really do damage if it landed. My coach kept his cool and just defended all his shots and tied him up in the plum. We don't throw knees to the face so he just held him there to make a point but the guy still went crazy, almost as if he didn't realize the other guy was going 30%. My coach faked a spinning back elbow counter off of this guy's jab to let him know that he could get him if he wanted to, to which this guy said ""No elbows, those are illegal"", and then continued to try to do flying knees 100% to the face. 

Here is the reason I am posting this...The whole time as I watched my coach and him spar, I wondered when my coach was going to let him have it. Crush him for being such a bad partner. But he never did. At first I was confused why he let this guys ego run and didn't knock him out, but I think I get it know. He tought me a lesson of what martial arts is all about. Control. He showed amazing control and restraint in not smoking this guy. It made me proud to be a part of this gym. Afterwards he had a few choice words for the guy and told him if you want to go hard, I'll go hard with you right now, but don't come into a new gym being super nice starting out at a normal pace and then suddenly go all out without notice. it's very disrespectful to your training partner and to the gym that welcomed you. I just wanted to know what you guys thought of this and if you would be able to do the same thing?"	t5_2r60y	True

1339535596.0	uym3a	Things I wish I knew before I started training: Tips for new muay thai practitioners	ronin1031	64	4	23	"I’ve been doing Muay Thai off and on for almost 6 years now and there are a few things I wished I had known before I started training. I’ve made a list below (sorry for the novel), and would like to hear from you all and try and compile a good list of tips for people who are new to Thai and don’t know where to start. 
So tell me your tips, improve mine, and help out future nak muay!

Here are my tips in no particular order:

- Semi-elastic (aka Mexican style) hand wraps are available (and in my opinion, much better than cotton). Be sure to get them LONG, most guys need 180” wraps, girls, usually 120”. The length is important, if you’re unsure of what length to get, go for the longer ones, just means you can add extra support to writs, thumbs, knuckles, etc.

-Thai shorts are key! They may look silly at first but they are cut so the legs are flared out to make kicks easier. It may not seem like much, but I found it made a huge difference in my kicks.
**Bonus tip** if the wide waste band bothers you, roll it down. You can also tuck the leg part of the shorts in for better kicking. When I watch fights and one guy has done this, I pick him to win, I’m 7-0 right now for predictions. Prove me wrong Reddit!

-Shop around for a gym. This one is probably the most important. The first few places I trained I felt more like gym member#### than an actual person. If the owner/trainer takes the time to walk you around and introduce you to everyone (not just the fighters,  or star pupils, EVERYONE) then he’ll probably care more about your training and improvement than if you went to a big McDojo with a fancy rep. 
On that same note, the smaller, out of the way places (in my experience) tend to actually have better quality trainers and fighters (yes, there are some exceptions like Iron Tiger, etc.)

-Clinch is very, very, VERY important. I find it’s the hardest part to learn, and the most often neglected. Most gyms (again, my experience) don’t teach it often, and when they do, its supplemental to one class a week.  If you can, ask to learn clinch and do some clinch sparring whenever there’s open training. I find its best to fight for position and if there’s an opportunity to throw a knee, do it very lightly and slowly, the other person will know that their day could have been ruined without it actually happening .

-When you start, you’ll look silly. We all did, it’s ok.

-Best way to learn kicks is to do  a lot of them. And when I say a lot, I mean 250-500 a day. That’s not a joke. When I started I came from a karate background so I had to break old habits, then make new ones, so the best advice I got was to kick, kick, kick. 
Best way to do it is when you get some open training, try and kick the bag as many times as you can in a round. For beginners I’d suggest 3-5 kicks with a leg, then switch (don’t try and fire them off like Buawkaw, but don’t fret too much at this stage about form). Once you hit your goal, let’s call it 250 kicks for beginners, your legs should be tired and you can now start working on form. Do one kick at a time, slowly, and think about your form, having someone with experience around would help at this point. 
This style of training works for most techniques, not just kicks.

Again, if you have any tips, add them in the comments. If you're new and have questions, ask away!"	t5_2r60y	True

1361412763.0	18xe63	For you beginner trainees wanting to have a crack at a fight..My thoughts and views on some things after being on r/muaythai for some time.	Maximus93	61	12	12	"Hey guys. I love the enthusiasm that is here on /r/muaythai so I decided to share some of my thoughts with you guys about fighting and training. 

I guess to start of I have been involved in the fight game for a number of years. Fought and trained in Thailand and I'm planning BIG things this year. My trainers push me to the brink of breakdown to get what I desire and after I am so honored and grateful for that. This brings me to the first thing on my mind when I browse this sub.

* **Training:** I have seen a lot of comments inquiring about having a first fight. This I think is one of the biggest steps to some sort of a fight career and you should be equipped with as much experience as possible before stepping into a ring. Before I stepped into the ring for the first time I was already training for about 1 and 1/2 years, with intense training leading up to the competition.
My first fight was a padded fight (headgear, 16oz gloves and shin pads), this is a good step to knowing if you are willing to continue with the fight game. Before you make the next step make sure you are ready because once the fights start lining up its hard to stop. Its like a drug. You build a strong relationship with your trainer and your buddies at the gym. In no way will you let them down in a fight or at training. Soon you will NEED to start training more then two or three times a week. You will need to stop whining about pain at sparring and you will need to toughen up and decide how bad you want the fight and *WHY*? Once you start training about 9-10 times a week then you are getting serious. Also not just hitting pads, but a lot of conditioning and clinch work. This push on mental and physical strength will leave you fatigued and demotivated. This is where your true character will blossom. This is the stage where fighters are born, not after one padded fight and certainly not after one sparring session. The fighter is born once you are physically and mentally broken but continue to fight, which leads to the *WHY*? again. A lot of people here will tell you to rest, I will tell you to gear up and carry on..because this is what we do. You cannot rest until you get that awe of winning and conquering your opponent, your own self and what ever else there is to be conquered between those four corners.

* **Why?:** 
Another serious question you must ask your self is Why? Why are you doing this? Why are you fighting? Why do you want to achieve the goals which you have set for your self? Is it simply for the fame? To be the tough guy or for the ladies? Or is there more to it than that? Do you have something to prove? This was the most important question for me and once i figured out the answer I was able to make the commitment that I will try everything to become a successful fighter on what ever scale, small or large, that might be. I guarantee you, once you figure this step out, you will see a great improvement in your fight and training ethic. 

I hope I am not rambling to much, but these are just some of the things which I have picked up on. It's as if some of you guys are getting a misconception of what fighting really is. It's emotional, difficult, mentally and physically exhausting and very time consuming. There simply is not enough time for excuses and injuries. Injured shin? Hit boxing mits. Injured knuckles? Start punching with one hand. I feel like I needed to tell you guys some of these things coming from my perspective. Muay Thai is raw. If you do not pour your heart into it or you just wanna do it to boast how much of a fighter you are then, my friend, I dont think this game is for you. It will break you. If you are willing to put so much of your life into this art then prepare for a hell of a ride!

I posted on FB that 1 like= 100 bag kicks(50 each leg). My personal record for an evening was 1200 counted kicks. That was over 2 years ago and took me about 2 hours at that time to complete. As long as I was to get over 12 likes, I would be happy. I ended up with 37.

I started at 7:00pm and finished little before 10:00pm. Every 100 I switched bags, starting with our  conditioning bag, followed by our 300lb bag and then a 200lb bag. After 900 kicks, I added a weighted vest with 30lbs attached and would alternate every 900 after. 

I've had a really tough year and last night was the first night in a while I wasn't in a dark place in my head. Setting a goal like this for an evening and being able to complete it... it's almost indescribable.

Buakaw is free to fight in muay thai again.	sharked	45	2	5	"On 2 July 2012, the five defendants being sued by Por Pramuk camp met at the Civil Court at Ratchadapisek for arbitration. They are: Mr. Noppon Wathin (the organiser of Thai Fight), Mr. Wisanu Am-Anand (the Thai Fight promoter), Acting Lt. Teerawat Yioyim (Buakaw's sports science trainer), Mr. Sombat Banchamek (Buakaw), &amp; the Sports Authority of Thailand (SAT).

Por Pramuk camp will withdraw their lawsuit against Buakaw, the Thai Fight promoter &amp; SAT, in return for the Thai Fight organiser dropping his 200 million baht counter-lawsuit against the camp, in order to bring the problem to an end.

It was reported in the evening news that from now on, Buakaw is free to fight in muaythai again, including in Thai Fight &amp; other events. He has to use 'Buakaw Por Pramuk' as his fight name, but is free to train on his own at his own camp, &amp; accept offers to fight. At the same time, Por Pramuk camp will also receive fight opportunities for Buakaw too. 60% of fight earnings will go to Buakaw, &amp; 40% to the camp. Income from public appearances, advertising &amp; promotions will be divided 75:25 (75% to Buakaw, 25% to the camp), but if Buakaw engages in these activities without the involvement of Por Pramuk camp, he will receive the full sum.

Comments like ""you fuckin suck karate guy"" are no good, lets be positive to one another, and do our best to lend constructive criticism via video, and become the muay thai community that we are capable of being.  I am going to start trying to respond to some questions with videos, and I really would like this to trend.  It would greatly benefit our subreddit, and all of the fighters within.  That being said, I'll post [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcEPiPhP9Ew&amp;feature=youtu.be) short video of me messing around on the bag, and see if the ball starts rolling.

1365609355.0	1c2i1l	How to be a good Muay Thai training partner!	ncguthwulf	23	2	23	"Here are some thoughts... please add stuff if I miss something:

1) Learn how to hold pads. Correct position for punches and kicks is crucial. Hold with confidence and work on being speedy. If you cannot transition from holding for 1-2 to holding for swing kick quickly you will force your partner to slow down. In addition, when you are holding pads for strikes you need to give back a little bit of resistance, slapping back as the strike comes in. 




2) Stay on the same page. If we are doing a technique that bores you or that you don't want to practice do not deviate. Respect the class and your partner and do the drills being shown. Next class there will be something interesting.



3) Engage with your partner. If they are flagging give them some motivational words, egg them on. If they are doing well, let them know. If they are having trouble maybe hold the pads a bit lower. If they can handle it, push the pace. 



4) Ask before you give advice. Dont just blurt out that your partner is doing something wrong. Ask them if you can give them a pointer. 



5) Be clean, trim your nails, beard, etc. Just be clean. Geez. Wash your wraps. Brush your teeth. 



6) Use good control and keep your power appropriate when sparring. Communication is the best way to discover what is right.



7) Try to partner with someone the same size. Even though you come to the gym with your friend who is 6 inches shorter and 50 lbs heavier than you does not mean they are the ideal partner. 



8) Say thank you!



9) If it is appropriate, test your partner's guard with the pads. If they are dropping their hands during or after an attack, reach out and give them a light tap with the pad to show them their gap.

I found this kind of interesting. I've only really watched the MT vs... fights, but tI think they make a great point that I'm always trying to get accross to my fighters, and that is always keep your cool and don't look away. In both fights, the MT guy wins because he properly pressures his opponent and his opponent doesn't know how to react and just turtles up.

I feel like the best thing MT teaches, is not techniques, but how to react when you get pressuered, by teaching one to stay calm, assess the threat and react accordingly. This goes for fights, school, work, life. If you train properly you're going to get much more out of MT than a work out and ability to throw kicks and elbows.

I am planning on travelling to Thailand to train muay thai for about a month and I would really appreciate your advice and feedback!

I've tried to read up on a lot of gyms, here on r/muaythai and other sites, but most of the recommendations are to gyms in Bangkok and Phuket which is not what I am looking for. I want to live in a smaller community which also isn't based on partying. I don't mind tourists and the occasional drinking tho.

A buddy of mine recommended Koh Tao and the gym located there seems to be pretty good, http://www.thaiboxingkohtao.com/

I was planning on travelling as soon as possible but I've heard that it gets really hot in Thailand during spring and summer and a then there's the rainy season and what not. 

Should probably mention, I've been training for about 4-5 months (2-3 times per week) but now I am looking for fulltime training (6 days per week)

1361317375.0	18umj4	So I just had my first sparring session...	bued07	19	0	25	"After about a year joining the gym (have not been going consistently throughout, only in the last 5 months that I've been going 3x a week), my Kru asked me when I was going to start going to the sparring sessions. After hearing that from him, I thought that even though I have not perfected the fundamentals, at least I know enough to go for sparring.

I did my research looking through sparring videos on youtube and reading teeps (sorry, couldn't help it) that other nak muay give to posts about sparring here in /r/muaythai. I spent the afternoon trying to store information in my head before the sparring session- only hit as hard as how you want to get hit, breathing, distance, relaxing, etc...

Come crunch time, nothing... I had nothing. I couldn't even throw a proper 1-2 combo. Couldn't keep my hands up, didn't know when to throw a kick most of the time, kept looking at their legs, getting overwhelmed by bigger partners (we do 2x 3min rounds with same partners then switch over the course of 1 hour), not wanting to get hit in the head, covering head and looking down on the floor while receiving an array of punches, end up having my punch ""chase"" them when they step back, very tensed, all I can think of was hitting my target... the list goes on. I've done sparring in boxing before, but adding the legs in the things to watch out for is a whole new level.

It wasn't all that bad though. I actually had fun. I was quite happy with my kick blocking and with a few kicks I've thrown. Most of the guys I sparred with were really helpful too. I've learned a lot and need to do a lot of work too.






So some tips for first-timers:

-wear proper protective gear (at least wraps, 16oz gloves depending on your size, mouthguard and shinpads if kicking)

-it's not about beating your opponent, use it to apply techniques

-give and/or ask for feedback from your partner

-keep your hands up. You will get hit, but best protect your head/face

-let your partner know that it is your first time and ask him to take it easy on you if he/she's a little aggressive

-have fun and learn from the experience






Some things I struggled with:

-Distancing - how do I start off throwing a combo? I seem to be trying to reach out with my punches and kicks most of the time.

-Blocking and catching a kick - I know i should stick to blocking for now but at what situation will catching a kick be good?

-Where I look at - Is eye contact the best way (using peripherals for watching out)?






I have more things but this is getting long and might be boring. So anyway, just wanted to share my experience. I'd love to know how it was for other people's first time sparring too."	t5_2r60y	True

Jedi_Master_1994	22	5	20	"So this guy in my class had been babbling on and on about how Asian martial arts were a waste of time and that the only real fighting styles worth anything were boxing and wrestling. He went on to say that ""no Asian man could take him down because he has too much of a size and weight advantage compared to Asian rag dolls."" This douchebag even had the ignorance to say that UFC fighters were smart because they ""didn't waste their time with that Asian shit."" I know, dumbass right? 

Anyway I casually asked him if he'd ever been kicked by a Muay Thai fighter before. He said he hadn't but that ""fancy Asian shit could never actually hurt anybody and that it only belonged in movies"" So I asked him if I could kick him twice in the leg to see if he could still stand. He almost scoffed at my request and said ""go right ahead""

Now I've been training from 9th grade to freshman year in college, I never fought competitively but I've kicked more bags and more sparring partners than I can count. I am by no means a bad ass or a master but I know I can kick hard for my size. So I proceed to kick his right thigh as hard as I could. I swear the smack could have been heard a mile away. He instantly collapses and starts cussing at me that I've broke something and that it wasn't fair because I hit his bone. As he's on the ground still pissed off at me and yelling that he's going to sue me. I refrain from cussing back at him, even though God knows I wanted to. I just gave him a look of pure, smug, triumphant victory and walked away.

1352223089.0	12qlqb	How to fight someone bigger than you?	tookie22	22	6	36	"Hi, I've been doing mma and muay thai for about 6 months now. I'm 16 years old, 5'5, and 105 lbs. I take a class with almost all adults. My smallest opponent is 130 lbs and I often fight people as big as 170lbs. My general game plan is to abuse my only advantage - speed. I generally try to stay outside and step in with a jab or maybe a small 2-3 punch combination and get out. I attempt to keep my opponent at bay with tipues (spelling?), feints, and leg tipues. I am attempting to work in leg kicks, headkicks, and oblique kicks as well.

Against the opponents with similar experience to me I generally do decently until  cardio becomes an issue. The main problems I have are opponents rushing me and getting stuck outside when they have longer reach and more power. 

Our actual fighters and  more experienced people tend to just destroy me (which is to be expected). I can't  mount any offense and I just get stuck running away and maybe landing a few good jabs.


Besides practice in general, what specific things can I do to improve my game?

Thanks

I was on 4-5 hours of sleep (I just couldn't sleep the night before) and went in started skipping rope with the others. Holy shit, that got me going. When the instructor arrived, he had a one-on-one with me helping me learn my stance and then knee-highs while everyone else did a combination of conditioning and technique. I actually wanted to work out with them, but I figure I need to learn my basics... all in due time.

After learning basic stance, I learned knee-highs and eventually got moved to practice on the bag as well. That was pretty awesome. Definitely helped to relieve some stress.

Class was over too soon... the instructor said I was free to stay, so I did for a bit, practicing my knee-highs. All in all, it was fun. I'm looking forward to the actual conditioning.

**TL;DR:** Went to my first MT class, did skipping rope (amazing cardio), learned basic stance and knee-high technique; practiced on a bag.

I will definitely be going back on Wednesday. 

EDIT: If anyone is from Toronto, I would love to hear how your first class was or how your gym did things. I'm wondering if I should check out other gyms or what.

We've all been there. The constant pivoting, unhardened skin vs mat (or worse carpet or concrete) makes for blisters, lot's of them. During my first couple days in Thailand my already pretty hardy feet were no match for the oh so cruel carpet that covered the slick mats adorning the gym. After a couple pivots and not being used to the surface one of my toes developed a slight torn blister, usually ignoring them I kept kicking and kicking until blood started to shoot from under my foot and my pad session came to a halt. It hurt, alot. Not having blisters for months I found myself on a frantic search on how to deal with this, in pain and afraid of infection I found some answers. Here is my guide to blisters for you fellow Nak Muays.

Training on carpet in Thailand I have quite a bit of experience with blisters and dealing with them.

All Blisters are not created equal.

If it's a ""hot zone"" a red inflamed area with **no bubble**, leave it be and wear two pairs of socks over it. You may hate the socks but make sure you don't pivot flat footed and you'll be fine. 

If it's a **bubble blister**, cut or poke a small slit at the base of the blister and squeeze the fluid out, it causes inflammation and delays healing. Before running or practice put a bandaid over it and wrap some hockey tape around the toe or area couple times and put a sock or two over it. Alternatively you can place your ankle support over your ailing foot if no sock is available. 

If it's **torn skin** (broken or ripped bubble), put a bandaid over it and tape for a day or two without tearing the skin off, after the skin underneath has a chance to heal a bit cut away the flap and bandaid/tape it before practice, no need for socks but you can if you want.

Keep the blister dry and let it heal, I started pivoting on a blister before it was fully healed once and it got very raw and VERY painful. If this happens, 3 pairs of socks.. 


Always try to keep the blister dry and take the tape off after practice, after removing the tape put some rubbing alcohol on it to kill germs and dries it out. baby powder also works wonders. Try to wear flip flops for a while and air it out when you can.

Blisters aren't the end of the world, but if you let them get out of control they can seriously make your sessions more difficult and painful, especially in humid climates. 

Once it's healed get back to using your foot without tape/socks/bandaids to harden up the skin, they go away pretty fast if taken care of and you'll have hobbit feet in no time. "	t5_2r60y	True

1351866469.0	12ijmu	New trainer... Not a happy student anymore. Opinions please?	duglles	18	2	20	"Hey all,

So I've been at the gym for around 6 months and have had a really good bond with my trainer and other students in the gym. It's been a fantastic experience..... Until last night that is.... Hoping you all can give some feedback about what I experienced last night.

There is a new trainer now. He was a professional fighter with over 60 pro fights under him and he is what I would call a ""fighter"" not a martial artist. To make this clear, I respect anyone who trains and respect anyone who fights even more. It's all amazing to me. 

Last night we (the kickboxing class) were worked very hard, I was at the point of exhaustion and ready to pass out at one point, called names like sissies, queers, etc, I was called out for my shadowboxing because I wasn't punching up - And I mean called out... I told myself that I was being too sensitive over this and continued on, however later on one of the other guys even brought up that I was ripped out for this, so I felt very embarrassed. 

I've never had this kind of trainer before and I am just not happy because that style doesn't motivate me at all. I didn't walk out as much as I wanted to, figured that I would prove that I don't quit. However this morning, I'm still pissed about it. I feel that it was disrespectful to me, to the martial arts and to the class.

I am also 39 years old and not in the best shape, that's one reason that I'm there. To learn and to improve myself physically, mentally and spiritually. This did NOTHING for my goals. I've never felt so beat up after a class, usually I'm inspired and ready to go for more.

Have you had trainers like this? How did you deal with them? Am I being over sensitive? I'm looking for honest feedback here and would appreciate any insight you all have.

EDIT 11/07/12

First of all, thanks to everyone who gave their opinions, everything helped put this into perspective.

I spoke to the head trainer briefly last night and he said he wasn't all that pleased with the language that was used, so that will not happen again. Also, this new trainer is used to working with fighters only, people who fight amateur/pro.... So I can understand his ""style"" now, more than I did last week. Another good thing is that the other regular trainer told me to just take anything he says ""with a grain of salt"" and that was good to hear also.

So, I'm glad that the conversation happened and I'm looking forward to going back regularly. Even if I get yelled at, I know now that I can push through it and also that it won't go to that frustrating level again. "	t5_2r60y	True

Before my story just like a lot of bitching Id like to tell you: I wanna keep going.

I got a pretty good partner. At first, he was punching and kicking pretty hard but I believe he adjusted his power a little bit later so I wouldnt hit the floor. Unfortunately, during a exercise involving a leg lock (I was holding him) he tumbled backwards and tore a ligament or something. He was out and I was feeling bad. Later he told its ok he had problems like this in the past, no hard feelings though he kinda grew on me and now he's out of the course. 

Ok, the trainer was pretty strict and everytime someone was talking he told all of us to do 10 or 15 pushups. I wasnt able to keep up with that. I can maybe do 2 pushups when Im fresh. I dont know why, he probably thought I was slacking off and he told me: Ok, you do ten pushups and everybody will be watching. So yeah, I could do one, I think, after that my muscles kept failing me and I kept hitting the ground with a thud, not really doing pushups. But he kept counting up till ten. 

I can only get better at this right? Still feel a little bad about my partner though."	t5_2r60y	True

I'll start with my favorite technique, the roundhouse kick. This kick is like a whip, generating the majority of the power from the pivot. If you notice on a whip, before it hits its target, the hilt is already headed back, same with the roundhouse. When you kick, pivot until your heel is facing your target before you shin hits, then right before it hits, just like the whip, start pivoting back as you kick the target. You should try to ""explode"" off the target with such force it throws your foot back to its starting position. The reason why this adds a huge amount of power is because of Newton's Law of Motion (not sure which one) every force has an equal and opposite force associated with it. So the force you put into bringing your leg back right before you hit, will get added to your kicks power. It will take a while to get down, but it has helped me get kids I teach to kick harder than adults who don't do this.

TL;DR: Pivot to 180 degrees as you kick, then pivot back right before you hit for added power because of physics.

Add any tips you've found throughout your years to help other Nak Muay especially beginners!"	t5_2r60y	True

He introduced me to the sport 8 years ago, shins of steel and a normal bag wouldnt cut it.


I ordered him this bag last Friday night. http://www.muaythai-fighting.com/fairtex-extra-large-heavy-bag-hb3.html

It arrived on my doorstep in Australia on Monday. Came to about $200 with UPS postage.


There is a bag at my gym which has little movement but not so sore to kick like a sand bag. I asked my trainer and he told me he bought rubber gravel as fill many years ago. (Tyre rubber)


I went home and searched to no availability of rubber gravel. Though i came upon rubber mulch at a local import center. I popped down to check it out.


Wasnt as cheap as i wanted but my friend was ok with it as long as it was a good investment. After some haggling, it came to about $45 for a 25kg bag.
I bought 3 bags. $135


This stuff doesnt have any hard or sharp edges. Though has good weight and flexibility.

http://imgur.com/BqlwuDP

http://imgur.com/I40efoF

http://imgur.com/DFrMeDN


Filled the heavy bag to the very top with 2 bags of rubber mulch.
So there is about 50kg of weight in the bag at the moment. 
We are going to let him work the bag for 5-6 months for the mulch to compress inside then top it up with the left over bag of rubber mulch. Hoping to bring the total weight of the bag to 75kg. This will insure less movement of the bag and make it harder.
Looking at the hessian bags the mulch came in, it looked to be able to fit 4 of the mulch bags into this heavy bag as the mulch was compressed. 
If this doesnt work, we will pour a bucket of sand in to fill in any gaps, increase weight and hardness of the bag.


Bag doesn't cave in with kicks and has a real solid feel with good shin conditioning aswell. Also felt really good to do skip knees on.


Sorry no end photos, we both ending up working the bag straight after then i had to go.


$335AUD all up to build this bag in a rush. 
Good for intermediate to start shin conditioning, skip knees, push kicks and repeated kicks without the bag swinging too much. 
I really wish i could find rubber gravel as it would have compressed a lot more, though we will see how the mulch goes."	t5_2r60y	True

My mind gets all clogged up when I'm in close boxing. I'm used to Tae Kwon Do, when I can kick someone into my comfort zone. But I feel like a complete idiot when I go to MT practice - when someone rains down a hail of punches, I close my eyes or blink a ton, turn my head, freeze/tense up. I love this sport, but I'm really, really discouraged here. Any advice based on this text or the video below?? Thank you all.

While the other 2 guys are warming up for class I decide to throw some punches and elbows on the hanging bag.

I throw jab, jab, right cross and plan to finish with a right elbow to the head... except the hanging bag had swung too far out after my right cross.

I completely miss the bag with my right elbow.

To make matters worse, I threw it as hard as I had been throwing into the heavy bags earlier.

The momentum throws me to the ground.  I try to catch myself falling and basically only manage to get my right foot under me.  All my momentum lands on my heel and drives straight through to my big toe that is jammed into the ground.

I didn't realize what had just happened... other than I had put myself on the ground from completely missing a fucking inanimate object.  At this point, I just think the only thing that is hurt is my pride.  I hurry and stand up, hoping no one saw me, only to look down at my foot and realize my big toe is cocked at an angle that it shouldn't.

An hour later, the urgent care doc confirms that I have indeed fractured my toe in a bad way.

So, here I am.  Doped up and pissed off that I won't be able to do any training for the next 3,4,5,6 or however many weeks this will take to heal.

Anyone have some good suggestions for alternate exercise to help keep strength and stamina up?  I know I won't be able to run, bike, snowboard or do a lot of lifts that I like (barbell squats, deadlifts, etc.)

**TLDR;  Broke my toe with my own elbow, help me stay in shape**

The other guy I was fighting came out after I was done sealing the ring, and before you knew it bell rang and it was down to business. He was very very much a hands heavy brawler, pushing his height advantage to try and keep me pinned down, however he was very heavy footed- solution. Leg kick x100000. The counter fighter game came in really well, almost had a count on him in the second but the bell rang before the reff could start the count. Third round he tried to superman punch instead of touching gloves, saw him comming however and avoided it, continued the same way, he'd come forward bombing, I'd let him, side step, leg chop, rinse repeat.

Fights over, everybody is cheering, I'm feeling confident, reffs raises my hand and honestly I was the happiest I've ever been then and there. Went back to the dressing room, iced down my shins (conditioning helps but damn it doesnt compare). Went out for a drink or two after, and now I'm  just chilling.

1375221654.0	1jdnj4	What to expect training in Thailand itself? Advice please!	Myogenesis	12	0	16	"Hello r/muaythai, first time poster here. I am a 21 year old recent University graduate from Canada who will be traveling to Thailand in September for a month. I plan on landing in Bangkok and after maybe 2 days I will be traveling north to the Chiang Mai province to train for a few weeks and then also do some wilderness trekking in the national parks.

 My background:

* I'm 6'1"" and 175lb, no idea on my body fat %. I've been working out for 4-5 years and have done Muay Thai for about 3 of those years.

* My Muay Thai experience is a bit odd however, I say 3 years and yet my formal training consists of one summer (4 months) of actual advanced classes 2-3 times a week. This was enough for me to get a good idea of the basics/a foundation, especially since I was motivated. This was back home, and after summer when I moved back to my University town I just continued my normal gym routine (weightlifting, cardio, etc.). However my gym has a heavy bag room (just a 100-200lb heavy bag swinging in a mirrored room) which I have been visiting around 1-2 times a week for the remaining 32 months that make up my Muay Thai experience. Since I've been by myself though, it is hard to push my workouts like a class does, I'm obviously missing out on a lot of key sparring, and I don't have anyone to check on my technique to keep me in line.

* I've done Ninjutsu for 2 years now as well, which is a more self-defense oriented art, however this has atleast kept up my conditioning as it is a class that helps push you.

* I've recently got a friend into Muay Thai and I bought a pair of focus pads and we've been practicing combos and the basics back and forth, but this has only happened ~3 times (also hes the same height as me but 50lbs lighter so...the relevancy of the workout is lacking). 

Anyways, if anyone has any advice please let me know!

 The mauy thai camp I've been researching is [Lanna Muay Thai](http://lannamuaythai.com/) in Chiang Mai, and their [training schedule](http://lannamuaythai.com/cgi-bin/s?c=0&amp;u=0000pr02l000488_training__training_schedule.html&amp;m=241532716517002) seems pretty legit (full range of cardio, sparring, pads, bags, shadow boxing, drills, clinching, etc.). Does anyone have any direct experience with this place or any recommendations?

What should I expect given my experience? If I go to the camp for 2 weeks, will I just be wasting time and be catching back up on the basics? Will I be paying to get my ass kicked? Or is 2 weeks enough to learn a few new techniques, the Eastern (original) style of muay thai, and overall just get a feel for it?

As a beginner student always eager to learn, I just had this idea today, of how awesome it would be if someone had a series on youtube or otherwise of **Great fights (old or new) with Analysis on the fighters, the strategies and the moves that are going on**

So instead of the regular sometimes idiotic commentators I see on TV (BOOOOM, that was a big shot, oh thats gonna hurt tomorrow, that man's a beast, etc etc) it would have detailed info (perhaps even with the video pausing / showing replays, etc?)... Something like, *Watch how he sets up the counter here* or *look at his strategy in doing A &amp; B* or stuff like that

This way, it could perhaps add a much more appreciation of the fighters (as not just mindless brutes testing who is just a tougher punching bag) as martial artists and strategists. Also (*Mainly my intention from it*) I think it would be a GREAT learning tool for us beginners?

I'll start:

The first school i trained at was a knock-off American Top Team that gives a bad name to the entire franchise.

* To start off, there were at most 2-3 people in every class, but i chalked it up to being a new school and hoped that it would pick up pace.



* When they finally found a Muay Thai instructor he would never refer to me by my name but rather as ""the worst one"" and ""the one with the terrible jab""

* Whenever i asked a question i was met with "" *sigh* i don't know why this is so hard for you to understand""

* fast forward a bit, every damn class they would make fun of my vale tudo shorts -_-

* The instructors eventually stopped showing up and only appeared when it was convenient for them

* During conditioning classes they (the instructors) would always make fun of me and tell me how i was proportionally weaker than the women in the class.   


Why did it take me so long to leave? Well i thought i just needed to toughen up, but after attending a different American Top Team and seeing the world of difference as well as the environment conducive to learning, i was convinced that my first school was wack as hell.

I have started taking Muay Thai this past week and am 3 classes in so far. I have no prior martial arts experience but so far I am really into it and feel as if it's definitely filled a void.

In my second class, I was taught the proper technique for performing a swing kick on a bag. On my 3rd I was again placed onto a bag for swing kicks but had only a day in between classes to recuperate my shin for more practice. This left my shin FAR too sensitive for the bag, leaving me to just tap the bag and practice form for the remainder of the class.

Question: After practicing your kicks for long enough, do the nerves in your legs deaden? I'm wondering how I can condition myself to work through/ eradicate the pain seeing as right now it's an awful sensation that I want to remedy as soon as possible so I can start kicking with a good amount of force again.

Also: These veteran fighters in my class can kick impressively high, is there any exercise/stretch in particular that anyone has found to be especially effective in terms of improving your flexibility for Muay Thai kicks?


**TL;DR:** Love Muay Thai, Shin painfully sensitive to bags. How do you deal with it?


Thanks everyone!"	t5_2r60y	True

 The opponents trainer jumped in the ring, went over to our corner and smacked our trainer who was standing behind the ropes.
 The fight was ruled no contest because my friend was dq'ed for poor sportsmanship and his opponent was dq'ed because his trainer entered the ring and hit our trainer.

 My friend is really down in the dumps about it because he threw his 10 week fight camp down the drain and embarrassed himself, our gym and the sport of muay thai.

I started Muay Thai just over a month ago and I can honestly say I'm addicted to training! Around the same time I started someone around my height and weight also enrolled. Both of us being smaller guys we naturally get paired up most of the time for pad work and timing drills. The problem is that this kid does everything at 150 percent. Our two coaches have to consistently stop him and correct his habits but nothing gets through to him. Hes pretty  young (highschool junior) but it seems like his ego cant be checked. Tonight he wrecklessly threw an elbow way harder than he was supposed to and it slipped off the mitt and made contact with my nose (lots of blood thankfully no break). The kru handled it, but he kept insisting that it was my fault and I wasn't used to him being southpaw. I feel like I could get stupidly injured with him and not be able to train in the future. My gym is like one big family and i don't want to cause drama or problems since were both new.

What can I do in this situation?

My problem is that my kicks seem to be severely lacking in power. It's not that I cannot generate the power, it's that my flexibility (or lack of) gets in the way. 

Working on the heavybag I can throw low kicks with alot of power, but when I am doing padwork with partners it feels as though my leg just slaps against the pads. I'm orthodox, and when I throw my back leg for a kick, it feels extremely under powered.

When I throw the kick I (depending on the situation) step out to the side, pivot my foot, twist my hips and raise my leg (kind of up the the side) so that my leg 'whips' into the pad. Sometimes I can pull off a decent kick or two, but it seems alot of the time my tight hips prevent my leg from cutting into the pad right.

Should I be angeling my kick differently? In a more of a straight up\diagonal way? I understand that I'm a naturally unflexable person and that I've only just started Muay Thai, but I feel my poor form and\or lack of flexability is going to take a while to sort out. Thoughts?

Had a dislocated knee that kept me out for a while, followed that up with a car accident and then a wedding (wife said she'd murder me if i was bruised up in our wedding pics).  And now, here I am. Packed, ready, and about 10 - 15 mins from leaving the house. 

This is one of those events where a stack of different gyms all meet up at a well known gym, you weigh in, get paired, and then everyone gets into it.  How hard you go depends on how hard he goes, is my understanding of it all.  

Hopefully I'll have some photos and videos to show at the end of it. 

edit: Had a basic points system where two judges would score each flush hit and count it as 1 point.  3x 1m rounds (had to be shortened due to the number of people who showed up).  Ended up losing 12-11, despite 2 knockdowns.  He bloodied my nose for me, but I did a number on his legs (i opted to wear thin foam shin guards instead of the big thick twins ones).

I picked up on a few things I need to sort out and was given word about a show that is being put on in May that I am welcome to put my name down for.

Went with 6 boys from the gym, the first time for them in the ring.  Everyone did really well, and gave it a great shot. Waiting to see if the video turned out ok, all the photos were too dark to use.

A lot of the guys there have been doing this sport for way longer than I have, and needless to say are a lot bigger/better than me, which I'm cool with, there's a lot to learn from sparring with more experienced fighters. The thing is, I can never land a solid shot or pass a guard without taking a few hits. I understand getting hit is a part of the sport, and trust me I have zero problem with it, but it just gets a tad annoying whenever I try to throw a punch, kick, or step forward and can't make it/eat a glove.

So, I've been told to create openings in my opponents' guards and try to scope out their weak points, but I don't know how to accomplish this or what to look for.

It seems strange because I've been doing both for months with no problems and I've only recently started experiencing the pain in my shins.

After the first class where I kept taking roundhouse kicks to my floating ribs, I was focussing mainly against defending against those.
 
Whilst I was being the aggressor, the instructor kept telling me that I have to relax and not bounce about so much. I was wondering if you guys have advice on how to relax during sparring? I imagine a lot of it is bad habits I picked up whilst I was training in TKD  way back when. I also imagine that I will become more relaxed with more mat time.

One of the guys I was sparring was huge and I couldn't land anything other than leg kicks on him. What should I be concentrating on when I'm sparring with somebody who is taller, stronger and more skilled then me? Obviously, sparring is about improving, not winning.

Specifically, I need help with how to speed up my jabs, hooks, uppercuts purely because my combination rarely ever finish or connect. My kicks are perfect and I have no problem kicking all night if need be, but as you all know, kicks on their own are useless. Often I find myself stuck in guard being pounded and seeing a hundred different openings but with no strength or energy left in my upper body to string an effective combo or even a damn jab back at my partner. When sparring begins, I can usually dole out a few quick, snappy punches and a few combos, but after a few minutes my arms are near useless or moving much too slow and using far too much energy.

I have asked my trainer and a few more experienced fighters for help regarding what to do and all have suggested to punch with some small dumbbells which will make moving my arms with only a few oz gloves on much easier. I lost my first fight because of bad hands and I am desperate to improve and become better! I've started using the dumbbells suggestion but is there anything else, like specific exercises or whatever to help with boxing?

I've googled into the problem, but as you can imagine all I find are a bunch of sites with people I am unsure even know what they are talking about, let alone if they have any experience in any sort of combat sport or martial art.

I practice MT to keep fit, and I love every aspect of it. I'm guessing this would be pretty common in training, so it's a newbie question. 


2 weeks ago in the sparring session, I kicked the knee of my sparring partner when he was blocking. It hurt, even with the shin pads on. Probably the angle, and I was kicking pretty hard too.



It still hurts now whenever I kick (even when kicking the pads), but it's still bearable. Talked to my instructions, he said it's common.. and those injury from knee vs shin will take ages to heal. He suggested just wrap a sock on it to soften the impact.

The only experience I've had in any sort of martial art was taking taekwondo for about a year when I was younger. I live in Suffolk, VA and I've been looking into gyms in Virginia Beach, Chesapeake, Norfolk, and Portsmouth (e.g. I've looked anywhere close or within the, ""Seven Cities"") for a few months now, but I can't afford to go to any. A guy I work with has offered to take me under his wing because he's trained and fought for many years before moving to, America. He's stopped fighting since he moved, so he just trains in bjj now. 
He's already given me some necessities such as: headgear, gloves, thai pads, a heavybag, and a speed bag to help me get started. He even offered to help me train. 
The reason why I'm looking to, /r/MuayThai, is so I can get a plethora of diverse opinions rather than just my coworker's advice. I should mention I weigh around 130 lbs, I have a slim body type, and I'm 5'7"" tall. I realize this won't be easy, it's not suppose to be. I'd like to fight one day, but I'd also like to not die because of lack of experience.

I ended up on [Koh Yao Noi](http://www.phuket-krabi-muaythai.com) and had a great time: The island is incredibly calm, no party scene to distract you (some might call that boring, but it was exactly what I was looking for). The school was great: very dedicated teachers, not only making you repeat the moves but also explaining the principles and details. Since I traveled during low season I often ended up being the only student during the morning sessions, which was pretty awesome.

I am planning to do something like that again beginning of next year (but this time I would like to spend some in the North). It would be great if you could let me know about other good schools and maybe share some stories along the way.

1370559938.0	1ftpv0	At-home conditioning basics?	azraelpariah	10	1	6	Hello, I'm a 23 year old interested in getting involved in some martial arts, specifically Muay Thai. Due to my low income as I try to establish myself in the working world, I lack the funds to attend proper classes as of now, though there are several dojos in the area that offer Muay Thai training (usually along with Jujutsu or Silat). I was wondering if there were any regiments I could do at home, for free, that could prepare and condition my body for when I do have enough to begin taking classes. I'm assuming standards such as jogging and push-ups/sit-ups, but perhaps there are some other training techniques others can recommend?	t5_2r60y	True
1370345530.0	1fn94l	Today's workout: how can I rise to that level?	Csgod0	10	2	9	"I'm a very very new ( read: 3 day new) student of Muay Thai at a gym in North Phoenix. We normally start with 15 minutes of conditioning, some stretching, then 45 minutes of striking. It it normal for students to chain classes together to do 2-3-4 hours consequtively. 



I was persuaded to do a second hour today. We did 15 minutes of sit ups. Of course, I've been sedentary for 8 years, so I did about 10 and asked the coach what to do since I couldn't move anymore.

We were originally doing clap- sit ups. After I pushed to the limit, Coach asked me to grab the 60lb medicine ball from the corner. 

I ended up tossing it to my partner as he did his  sit-up cycle, then he'd toss it back. He did this for 10 solid minutes. I was sore because he nailed me in the chest with a 60lb projectile for 10 minutes. 

10 badass minutes of medicine ball sit-ups. Its insane. Its also kind of intimidating wondering how long it would take me to achieve that level of soul-crushing core strength.

 I recently competed in my first tournament after 7 hard months of training muay thai. To my surprise there were actually 30 people in my weight division! I managed to win four fights in a row up to the gold medal match, but unfortunately I fell short and lost the finals by decision. I took home a silver medal with pride and my coaches were very proud of me especially for my first tournament. I was the only fighter in my division to finish fights (two body shot ko's) and busted up one guys nose pretty bad.
Everyone told me I should be really happy with a silver medal and that it's spectacular for my first tourney, but I can't help but feel shitty about not winning the finals. I know I could have done more and was hesitant against the last guy. I had watched his fights and knew he was very good. I think mentally I was beat and psyched myself out before the fight even started. What a crappy feeling that is afterwards knowing that I could have done more. To add insult to injury, the guy trains at the gym that my coaches used to train at. I know it would have been an amazing accomplishment if I had beat him. 
I talked about it with both my coaches and they told me they are really proud of me and how I competed. It was an awesome experience and I cannot wait to do it again!

I've been a martial arts fan for many years. Finally a muay thai gym opened in my city and I started training. The coach is a very competent and good guy, he fights professionally and he taught me the basis of muay thai.

The problem is, I'm the least athletic person on the planet. I have extremely low stamina and i run out of gas very fast. I feel weak and out of focus after a few minutes of training.

I don't know how much of this is caused by respiratory issues i have, principally turbinate dysfunction. In short, i can only breathe from my mouth. The cold, dirty air, unfiltered by the nose cause my airway to almost completely close. But this only happens sometimes: I think that, even without this condition, i would suck, because I'm now 25 years old and i never practiced any sport previously. 

The day at my gym is that of most gyms: after a warm up session (burpees, sprints, push ups, etc) we train techniques: a day for the clinch, a day for pads work etc. Other days we go for a run or do circuits.

The problem is that i can barely finish the warm up without depleting all my energies. I trained for a whole year there now and i think it's time to stop going there and take whatever time it takes to reach a decent level, and then join the gym again. Those guys are good and they train too hard for me. I improved technically, and obviously on the athletic side, but not enough. I think my results are very mediocre for a whole year of training, and i would like to train for a while from a lower level. We are a small gym and they can't slow down the training sessions only for me. 

I'm reading ""Infinite Intensity"" because it seems to be recommended a lot and also about the ""couch to 5"" running program. I have a weight room with dumbbells and barbells, and a heavy bag. I follow your average ""healty diet"". In a few month i'll also undergo a surgical procedure to correct my respiratory problems. 

I'd like to ask you guys if you think this is a good idea and how you would start to build an athlete, starting from almost nothing.

1355212331.0	14nmpk	Righty training southpaw, thinking of switching to orthodox.  Advice appreciated!  	chriswu	9	1	14	"Hey guys,

When I started Muay Thai (been 5 months 2/3 times a week discounting time off) I started south paw because that's what I was used to from BJJ and Fencing (Although I snowboard orthodox).  Even so, something still felt a bit off as I trained.  I thought that would go away, but I'm still getting that weird feeling.  In fact, in some respects it's gotten worse.  When I started, I would train the rear roundhouse (left) much more than the switch, so it was significantly better, but now that I've got enough reps in on both legs, my right leg (what should be my natural rear foot) is starting to surpass my left.  This is compounded by the fact that I am about 1.25 years out from ACL, MCL, meniscus reconstruction on the right knee, so my right leg is still weaker when acting as the standing leg for my left roundhouse.  I can throw faster and maintain better technique with my switch kick now (when the Kru calls for speed kicking).  

I'm wondering if I should just convert to orthodox stance.  

Here are some of the pros I have for staying southpaw:  

1)  I had some hope of doing some amateur MMA (I'm 32, so seriously, it will only be for fun times) in which case I thought it would be advantagous having my striking and grappling stances be the same.  

2)  The natural advantage southpaws have since orthodox are not used to facing them

3)  I like the longer distance since most times I'm facing an opposite stance.  

4)  More power in my lead hand

5)  Standing orthodox also feels a little weird now (I have no natural stance.  Damn!)

Cons:

1)  Still feels kind of weird

2)  Less power in my rear hand

3)  South paw tactics/strategies are not really highlighted during training.  Everything in taught in the orthodox stance (with southpaw being addressed as ""do the opposite"").  

So what do you guys think?  Should I switch to orthodox?  I know some people will say just learn both, but I'd like to have a base stance to work out of.  

Thanks for the advice guys and gals!"	t5_2r60y	True

When I throw a roundhouse, I like to connect with more of the lower outer shin/almost instep area. It feels ""right"" to me, and it helps me get that ""snap"" sound on the pads/bag that my trainers like so much, and I feel like it's got the most power since it's at the end of my leg.

A lot of people talk about kicking with the shin to help condition it for blocking - checking kicks hurts/bruises me right now and I'm trying to build this up. But since one typically blocks with the upper shin, should I make my kicks connect with the upper shin? This usually makes me feel too close and (on the bag at least) hurts if I do it too hard or for too long.

1373730319.0	1i7zcp	Warrior Way in MI had a seminar last night with Saekson Janjira and Matee Jedeepitak. I finally got my white band.	alittlerelief	7	0	3	"It was a great seminar. Saekson showed a lot of his much more aggressive style, while Matee coached and laughed at all the jokes Saekson was cracking in his demos. Matee also did lots of training and demonstration as well. It's really cool to see World Champs in their human form, laughing and hanging out while still bringing all of their wisdom with them.

We worked on a lot of clinches and throws, which I haven't seen much of in Matee's style, although I only go to the Fundamentals class as I don't have time to go to the Mixed class. They were incredibly effective, and Saekson is beyond fast.

One big thing Saekson pushed was setting up strikes. Fakes, jabs, hooks, all effective, but even more effective as long as you set up your next move and you can adapt to what your opponent does. To make this more effective he made sure to tell defenders to actually defend, rather than simply allowing the attacker to do their moves while you practice, keep moving, defend, throw jabs back to keep their guard up. Obvious, but helpful to get your own movements down, and helpful to actually focus on. It all seems so obvious, but as I'm sure we all know it's difficult to do when you have so much on your plate. Muay Thai is no cake walk.

Saekson also made us all feel very confident, at least for me he did. He used the old adage, ""We never stop learning,"" and discussed the benefit and joy he finds in training with people of all skill levels and styles. He mentioned Matee's two Lumpinee belts, and spoke of how he has none, but being a champ isn't everything. Training, loving the art, and never giving up are more important.

It was an amazing seminar, and I can't wait for the next one. A big thank you to Matee and Saekson, you guys are animals.

I have never done a martial art before (I'm 22 and female, just for the record) but am interested in taking Muay Thai classes. I have a few questions and I thought I'd turn to your subreddit for advice. I've poked around using the search function and I'm trying to not repeat any questions, but I apologize in advance if I am.

1. I have flat feet and a very weak left ankle (birth defect), is Muay Thai going to be a rough sport considering these problems? 

2. What are some tips for finding a good gym? Should I be looking for certain types of certifications from a governing body?

3. Are all-female classes typically watered down versions of the art? I'm primarily concerned with fitness, but I don't want to take a rebranded zumba class; I'd like there to be a strong fighting/self-defense element. 

4. Speaking of fitness, should I have a base level of fitness before I start? I lift weights, but don't do much cardio because of my ankle. (I was hoping that Muay Thai would be a good place to get my cardio in.)

5. Any opinions on a good general price range? (I'm in Colorado.)

Any other advice for a beginner would be very appreciated. :)

EDIT: I don't want to say the exact same thing to everybody, but I appreciate the advice! It sounds like checking the gyms out in person and talking to the instructors about my ankle/feet would be the best idea. And I have a better idea on pricing as well! Thanks so much, everyone."	t5_2r60y	True

What do you eat for breakfast?




I usually train 2h/day and quite often I feel exhausted after training, even in the next morning. Training is regular muay thai: pads, sparring, technic, cardio etc.

Though the video described this idea, it only actually showed the fighter making three dots on the floor and working with a heavy bag.  Some users mentioned that it was similar to a drill that Bas Ruttan had used in one or more of his videos.

1350006612.0	11cdno	I had a disappointing session today. I could use some advice: 	crb343	7	0	18	"Hi everyone, 



Just got back from the gym and I'm feeling kinda blue. I'm new to Muay Thai (although I do have a little boxing experience) and this is only my third week at the gym, but I feel like today was pretty disappointing. 



Today we drilled some blocking stuff: Working with right and left hooks, jabs, and crosses only, we were to block our partner/""opponent""'s punches using light parrys with our hands, blocking with the palms of our gloves, and (in order to defend the hooks) blocking with our forearms and gloves raised past our head. 



During this drill, I seem to have overextended my elbow, and it feels bad now. I've never experienced this kind of thing before, but I feel discomfort when I move it in certain ways. I'm pretty sure it's a tendon-related issue, but I have no idea what to do besides ice it. 



On top of that, during the drill mentioned above, I felt like I was tying my arms in a knot--It was hard for me to predict what punch was being thrown..I'm not sure how to improve on this and it's kinda frustrating. 



The next drill we did was with Thai pads. We were to throw a jab, then a cross, then step back and do a push kick (I'm sure that's not the term, hopefully you know what I mean) with our left leg and throw a medium/high kick with the right leg. 



I couldn't get the push kick right at all. Going from the cross to the push kick was brain-fucking me the whole time, and I couldn't gauge my distance at all. This affected the placement of my left leg and made it very awkward all throughout. I can throw the high/medium kick fine, but the push kick was really messing with me. So much so that I felt like I had to make this post. How do you guys improve this? I feel like practicing with a partner is the only way, but I don't have another class until Monday, and we're likely not doing the same stuff again.  



The whole experience made me feel like a total vagina, especially since these guys at the gym are tough and used to this kinda stuff. I'm not a vagina, goddammit. I'm willing to go through whatever pain/struggle it takes to advance in this sport. It's a new passion and I can't get enough of it; I just felt like I should've done better today. 



Any advice, guys? "	t5_2r60y	True

I'm 38 and never did kickboxing before. I had boxed back in my early 20's for a couple years, but that didn't seem to affect the whoopin I got last night.

We didn't go really hard, probably about 20% power, but I couldn't land a single shot, couldn't get out of range and whenever I threw anything, I got countered. I panicked, turtled up and tried to stay out of range. My trainer said the whole thing to learn is about being comfortable ""in the pocket"", but there was NO WAY that was happening. Found out that I couldn't slip anything, couldn't block, couldn't get outside and come in on angles.... No matter what I did, I was getting my ass handed to me. Didn't help that the guy I was sparring with was 4-5 inches taller with a big reach advantage.

Truly a humbling experience, but is this normal to do after 2 weeks of training? What can I do to remove the panic and tension that I felt?

I'm not about to quit, but really feel like crap about myself and my abilities today. Didn't even hang out with family last night after class, just went home, and straight to bed.

I have been a student on &amp; off (meaning 1 month on, 1 month off for work-travel quite consistently) for the past year months

Recently I have just started sparring at the gym (yesterday was my 6th time sparring), and I must admit, my self-confidence levels (read *balls*) are not really what I would've wanted. To be blunt about it, I was fucking afraid of stepping into the sparring!

During the sparring, I felt kinda better, but I was too afraid to actually focus on good technique and started to fight like an ignorant douche, flailing arms and throwing stupid kicks

Now I have to admit, we don't really go *that* hard in sparring, not anything to harm the other person or anything, but body shots that you can actually feel. Also, I have to say that almost everyone I've sparred with so far, has been way more experienced than me, but REALLY took it quite easy and were very decent and kind, so totally not their fault

However, I must admit, I do not feel as *courageous* as I would have liked to feel stepping into those sparring sessions

I fear that if I am already a bit fearful going into sparring knowing the other guys are friendly and are gonna go a bit easy on me, then I will probably be scared shitless of stepping into an actual fight!

So, /r/MuayThai is there something I can do to build up my confidence levels a bit (*perhaps get into fights and let people beat the shit out of me to get used to it :P seriously j/k*)? 

Does it get better with time / more sparring etc or am I just too much of a chicken to pursue such a sport and should just shy away at home and resent my self for eternity?

*PS: Maybe it is a stupid macho-man thing or maybe it is just me, but admitting being afraid (not to mention on the internet, in front of tons of strangers) is no easy thing for me. I hope it means I've grown up or some other shit*

**EDIT: Thank you all VERY much for the advice and for most of all, telling me that this is normal for a beginner and not to worry about it too much. I will take all your advice to heart, and try to harden up and keep at it. Don't get me wrong, its not that I didn't enjoy it, nor that I did not expect to get hit at KB training, but it was just fear that made me doubt my resolve. Now that I KNOW it is completely natural, I will just embrace calming myself down and controlling it**

Standing orthodox my jab feels very powerful, my left straight isn't very powerful (comparatively), and my right hook is my strongest punch. Also my switch kick is more powerful. It's very clear that my right side is dominant, I'm not sure why fighting southpaw just feels better.

I'm considering going orthodox for a while, wondering if anyone might have any input? It's my understanding that a large part of a southpaws advantage is having good power on the left side. Since I'm right hand dominant, should I just learn to fight in the traditional stance?

Thoughts?

My only concern is that i kept focusing on doing the movement correctly that I'd forget to keep my guard up properly. Then I would pay more attention to the strikes and guard but forget to rotate my leg with the cross or lose balance slightly.

Obviously, muay thai is a contact sport, and an intense one at that. It involves contact with others, and in some cases those people are bloody sweaty. Dripping, even. Sometimes we clinch, sometimes we train with ladies, or children. In short, sometimes we get in close contact with others' bodily fluids. And comfort levels with this vary.

So I guess what I'm interested in is how you all think and feel about it?  How do you all feel about others' sweat? Do you hate it? Not care? Think sweaty guys should wipe down? Use it as lube in the clinch? Are you yourself sweaty? What do you think is an appropriate way of handling it? Does your gym have any rules or norms as to how people should act?

OK so, I've just picked up Muay Thai (just 2 lessons so far) and I just have two quick questions:

-when I was 16 (24 now) I fucked up my left shoulder due to a fall while skateboarding. Nothing was broken, thankfully, but since then, sometimes when I do unusual movements with my arm (like if I'm stretching really hard when tired, or just hanging curtains with my arms and hands up high) my shoulder just ""pops out"" (sorry I don't know the proper term for this) and there's nothing I can do for the following 2-3 minutes except move real slowly, waiting for the shoulder to pop back in on its own. Not a big deal in day-to-day life since it happens quite rarely, but I was thinking maybe this could be a problem when boxing. When throwing a left punch I can feel that my shoulder is kinda weak. Will this be an issue or will it get better/stronger over time?

-I appear to be quite flexible (or at least more than my friends, none of martial artists), as in, I can do a head kick to someone standing up with no problem (even though I don't have the proper technique at all). Is that really out of the ordinary, and will it really help me in muay thai? I'm just curious whether this is an advantage or not, guess it would make me slightly more confident knowing that I have at least one quality at this sport :)


Keep in mind that I'm a complete beginner, and it's my first time ever practising a martial art. Thanks for the answers, cheers all. Heading to my 3rd practice in about 3 hours :)"	t5_2r60y	True

I've been training Muay Thai for about 6 months, working (by my standards) pretty hard. I've toned it down over the break but in order to hit the ground running in 2013 I made up a weekly training schedule I intend to follow for a week or two at least before modifying it, hopefully increasing the difficulty and efficacy. Without further ado:



MONDAY - AM: Weights (full body, 5-15 reps)
                PM: 3 Mile Run + 1 hour Yoga

TUESDAY - AM: Rest
                 PM: 3 Hours Muay Thai training

WEDNESDAY - AM: 30m Muay Thai bag work, bodyweight exercises + plyometrics 
                      PM: Yoga

THURSDAY - AM: Rest
                   PM: 3 Hours Muay Thai Training

FRIDAY - AM: 45 minute run, Yoga
              PM: Rest

SATURDAY - AM: 3 Hours Muay Thai training
                PM: Weights, heavy

SUNDAY -   AM: 2-3 Hours Muay Thai training, mostly sparring
                PM: Rest


And that's it. I don't have a full day of rest in there, but the Yoga is more of a mental discipline exercise and not too taxing on the body, as well as good stretching. I don't expect to get burnt out, but we'll see. Please share an opinion, whether you think it's a solid schedule, needs some improvement, or is for spineless weaklings.

Hurricane Sandy caused a great deal of damage to New Yorkers. Unfortunately, our friends Chris and Sarah Romulo of CROM Martial Training were not spared. Their school, located out in Far Rockaway, was one of the hardest hit zones and was destroyed.

Chris built this school with his own hands. CROM and Muay Thai are not only their way of living, but their way of life. You may know Chris and Sarah from the 'smokers' that they often host, generously putting in their time and money to give novice fighters and Muay Thai enthusiasts a way to show their skills. And these events help promote Muay Thai here in New York City. Their local community know them for their tireless contribution as spokesperson for the anti-bullying campaign, Kickin' It. And the Muay Thai community know them for their great contribution to the Muaythai Preservation Project, a project that helps underprivileged kids through programs designed around Muay Thai. We are calling out to the Muay Thai community to come together, and help Chris and Sarah rebuild their school and their lives so that they can continue doing great things.

Coban's Muay Thai Camp will be hosting a fundraiser seminar to contribute towards their recovery. This will be a 2 hour Muay Thai seminar with great two champions. 2-time Lumpinee champion and 5-time world champion, Coban Lookchaomaesaithong and WKA North American Muay Thai Champion, Chris Romulo. They will be sharing their knowledge and experience with you. Tickets cost $95, and 100% of the proceeds will go to CROM Martial Training. Maximum capacity is 40 participants; so reserve your spot early.

In addition, we will be having a raffle. Each raffle ticket costs $20. The prizes are:

1. Team Coban NYC T-shirt - value $35
2. Team Coban NYC bag gloves - value $55
3. Private lesson with Coban - value $225

Tickets for the seminar and raffle tickets are on sale at the camp so come out and join us for this great cause! Now more than ever we are reminded of Chris' personal philosophy, ""All it Takes is Heart."" Come and join us for an afternoon of Muay Thai, friends, family, and heart."	t5_2r60y	True

I know some of you train Muay Thai in its pure form, however my trainer learned from Duke Roufus and even though Duke learned traditional MT, he does not refer to his style as that (from what I've heard). 

My trainer stated that our base is MT, but he has taken some techniques from the Dutch style of Kickboxing, some Kempo Karate and TKD, plus the hands we use some traditional boxing techniques, so my question is are we still sort of training MT or what?

I'm so confused about all of this... I've found this style to be effective, but does it lose something because it's not ""pure""?

 EDIT - Thanks for the response folks. Some food for thought. I've been training for like a year and a half and workout pretty regularly apart from MT and always have so don't know that muscle fatique would be the culprit, however I am by no means an expert so I'll bear it in mind. Take on plenty fluids throughout the day as well as during and after training.

Not quite on the original topic but what sort of prices are reasonable. I would definitely like a combo of group and private but from what I have seen that could get expensive quickly.

I have a background in team sports (mostly hockey) but have not done any sort of true physical activity since high school (About to turn 22).

When being paired with the gentlemen who have been training much longer than I have, they offer to ""go light"" when practicing kicks. While I appreciate the offer, usually after a few ""light"" kicks I tell them to give me a real kick. ( I don't want their training to suffer because they got paired with a fragile female) I take the kicks without being a weenie but there's this split second after each kick that I have to silently assess whether or not the radius bone might be fractured or make sure I'm not damaged). I hope to one day inflict that kind of concern on another person but in the meantime I was wondering- is this somehow GOOD for the bone?

However, it seems like I'm going at it at a too high intensity. I never hit or kick harder than I want to get hit myself, but often it seems like my sparring partners want to go at an even lower intensity. So of course I'm trying to go even lighter, but I find it difficult. 

I don't think I'm going that hard - maybe 50%? - and every time I try to go lighter, I feel like I'm missing the snap in my punches. My kicks will also be really slow because I have to restrain the power and not follow through. 

I also often get caught in the moment and punch harder than I intended, especially when I counter (accidentally bloodied one sparring partners mouth shield and gave a pretty big bruise on the left thigh of another from low kicking, she still has it almost two weeks after).

Do you guys have any tips on how to go lighter? 

I think I'm pretty relaxed when I'm sparring, so it's not because I tense up. We usually go 3-5 rounds at 2-4 minutes when sparring and I'm never tired afterwards, contrary to grappling sparring where I'll be crawling off the mats, absolutely exhausted, after three 4 minute rounds.

Usually I only get them on my big toes and pinkie toes, so those are easily wrapped.  However, this time I was doing some long-round sparring sessions and after the day was done I had blisters on the pad below my big toes as well as my big toes.  We train on a concrete floor, where our heavy bag is, and sometimes on removable mats when we spar.  We don't have an actual martial arts gym to practice at here.  After a good 2 months of steady bag work 2-3 times a week, I'd have assumed that my feet would be conditioned enough to not blister up every time I don't wrap them.  

Does anyone have any suggestions for developing callouses?  I'm in the military and wearing combat boots for 12 hours a day, so I can't really take my shoes off and walk on rocks all day to harden them up.  Or maybe it's a technique thing?

I'm pretty new to MT and have been sparring/training for nearly a solid month now.

Generally I go pretty hard during training but I noticed something that my partner started doing - he will begin routine combo training with good form but slowly sacrifice it to exhaustion.  However, he won't slow down, he'll simply keep pushing himself in this exhausted state until the round is over.  Since we're not sparring but only performing drills, should I be doing the same?  

I want to push myself to build muscle, bu I also want to retain form with muscle memory.

Sometimes I can go two-three weeks without feeling a thing and I'll be completely fine. Sometimes I can have one lesson and my fingers are still not right 24 hours later.

I am planning on seeing a Doctor about this but I thought it would be helpful to also ask for advice on here too. I do wrap my hands but it doesn't seem to make that big of a difference when it comes to my fingers. Even holding pads can make them unbearably stiff.

So my normal workouts find me mixing in with Boxers for many drills. As such, it is not uncommon for me to be barefoot working with someone wearing sneakers. This occasionally results in my foot and the bottom of their sneaker impacting and myself, the pretty princess that I am, breaking a nail. Since my toenails are not excessively long and this occasionally ends up leaking some blood this happens I'd like to figure out something to do about this. 

I rather like being barefoot, so I'd prefer not to have to grab another pair of sneakers. Something like the New Balance Minimus might work if I could find a pair wide enough to fit, but that didn't work last time I'd checked. 

The best options that I can find so far are either [1] kung fu shoes or something like these [2] 'mma socks'. Does anyone have experience with either?

I’ve seen a lot of posts in the past about people looking for good and reasonably priced proprietor for fighting equipment and I recently had to purchase some new gloves and went on a search, so I thought I would share the experience.


After a long search (I will spare you the details), I ended up going with [ThaiSmai 16oz gloves]( http://www.muaythai-fighting.com/thaismai-boxing-gloves-velcro-attached-thumb-bg-124.html), (black, if anyone cares) I’ll be doing a review of those as well if there is interest. I had been shopping around various sites and stores, but this site had, by far, the best prices (and selection) but before I purchased, I went to ebay. And wouldn’t you know it, they have an [ebay store]( http://myworld.ebay.ca/muaythai-fighting&amp;ssPageName=STRK:MEFSX:SELLERID&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1543.l2533) with FREE SHIPPING. I’m going to repeat that, FREE SHIPPING… from Thailand, that’s like pouring out a bowl of lucky charms and getting all marshmallows. I should point out that I am from Canada, so it might not be free in your area, but I can’t really imagine any country as geographically huge and far away from Thailand as Canada, so I’m going to assume you get free shipping too.The ebay prices are higher, but when you take FREE SHIPPING into account, you save about 10$ per order on average. 


I had a look at their other gear and everything I saw was much cheaper than any other site or brick-store I’ve been too, and my old gym used to buy stuff directly from the Fairtex rep in Canada, so…ya, even their Fairtex stuff is well priced.


The best part? I bought my stuff on a Monday, so imagine my surprise when a package was delivered on Friday. So a total of less than 96hrs to send gloves from Bankok to Ottawa, and it was FREE (sort of).  The gloves cost me a grand total of $67.95 USD, which is at least $20 cheaper than any other quality glove I have seen online. 
All items have a 30 day returns, which I didn’t use, so I can’t comment on that. I also can’t comment on the customer service, mainly because everything went much better than expected and I never needed to contact them for anything.

So that’s my long review, let me know if you have any questions.

TL; DR: Great prices, fast shipping, best place to buy your gear.

9 months rust from previous martial arts; most recent resume includes BJJ and a tiny bit of Muay Thai, with Krav Maga and Danzan Ryu JJ before that. 

Anyhow, I attended my first class yesterday, and was dead after, but still loved it-the cardio was SERIOUS. We drilled some really basic stuff, and did some bag work after that to work further on those combos. If you're reading this forum, and you're contemplating taking this martial art for the health benefits, losing weight, or just improving yourself, DO IT-with the right team and instructors, it's totally worth it(and I haven't even attended the BJJ classes there yet-looking forward to that). That said, a few questions; I tried to abuse the search function, but didn't see these posts:

1)I'm sore as hell in my thighs after practice, and I did some stretching before hand, as well as downing water afterward. Tomato Juice seemed to help(I'm thinking it's the high potassium), but I was wondering if the ""Muay Thai Oil"" I've seen in a few places is worth my time, or if there's another Liniment that's just as good?

2)I have a previous case of Achilles' Tendonitis from Krav; I got it treated at a Sports Medicine clinic, and it feels great, but I was concerned with wrecking it via the jump rope that we do for warmup at the beginning of class. Would jumping jacks also work for warmups, or is there something else I should be doing?

3)We also have what's called ""Dutch Kickboxing"" at my MT gym; I've heard that the main difference in Dutch Muay Thai vs Traditional is emphasis on more hand technique vs kicks(I'm thinking fighters like Overeem). I was looking into taking the boxing class at my gym as well, and wondered if the same combos would be used in all three styles(Dutch MT, MT, and Boxing); I didn't want to train wrong, as I've heard that's all bad. Thoughts?

4)I'm traditionally Orthodox, but I'd also like to train Southpaw for the sheer ability to switch things up on an opponent; would it hinder me to work on that now with the basic combos I've learned, or is it okay to try to work it for an additional weapon?

Other than that, I survived, and am looking forward to Wednesday...thanks for any advice. "	t5_2r60y	True

It feels like my jaw is forward with my front teeth touching more than usual and my back teeth not able to make contact.  I have to really squeeze to get the back teeth together and it hurts like hell.  I used to have this problem a lot when I was playing lacrosse or football in HS, if I hit someone with my head, the chin strap would jostle my jaw and I would get like this.  Now, I have a feeling I may have TMJ joint problems in general because I had those braces with rubber bands to pull my jaw forward when I was younger because my jaw line wasn't pretty enough or something.

About 6 months ago I bought some [cheap shinguards.](http://fightingsports.com/p_CMMSGS+REG.aspx) Sparring in these is really bad, they twist all the time and don't provide good protection. They aren't secure enough for my liking. I got the ""Large"" if my memory serves me right. 

In September I have a fight coming up, and I feel that using these is sure to get me killed. During sparring I tone my kicks down to about 15% because anything above that will make them fly off. So here are my questions:

1. Do you have any specific shinguards you would recommend? I am 6'4"", but only 160 pounds so my leg is pretty skinny. Should I get large shinguards that protect the whole shin, or small ones that are actually secure?

2. I found two really good looking shinguards: [Fairtex Pro-Style Shin Guards](http://www.mmaoutlet.com/Fairtex-Pro-Style-Shin-Guards-P221.aspx)
and [Pro-Style Shin Pads](http://www.kofightgear.com/shin_guards.htm)

Which of these two would you recommend? Also, do you guys have any tips of measuring my shins or anything of that sort to determine the size of shinguards I should get? Pro-Style Shin Pads KO would have me use the Extra-Large ones, according to their measurement scale. I'm not sure about the Fairtex.

1336510456.0	tdiwx	How to improve confidence in preparation for second fight after losing the first?	smekas	5	0	25	"EDIT: I added the link to my first fight at the end of this post.

I've been training Muay Thai for over two years now. It started out as just fun, twice a week or so at most. As my fitness improved, I moved up to 4-5 times/week. The last 9 months or so have been more intense and I've dropped down in weight from 193 to 164 which is when I decided to enter my first amateur fight. I trained for nearly 8 weeks and made weight at 154.2 lbs. 

It was my first fight. My opponent's third, although he had lost the previous two. The fight went by fast. My opponent outboxed me. He swung wildly and aggressively. I clinched. After they'd reset us I'd get a few good shots of, a nice, strong kick here and there, but then he'd just overwhelm me with punches again until I clinch. The ref stopped the fight 4 seconds short of the end of the first round when I, according to him, with my back against the ropes, took too many unanswered punches. Most people said it was an early stoppage. I remember thinking in the first round how I just need to adjust my strategy with my corner and win the second. But it never came to be.

I wasn't even gassed. Or injured. OK, black eye... But hardly out of breath. I leisurely walked into my corner felt as if I disappointed my trainer and friends. They reassured me this wasn't the case. That I had looked good and composed, albeit maybe not aggressive enough, while the other guy looked uncontrolled and didn't practice proper form. Everyone assured me that I was better and could have won had the fight been allowed to continue. This went a bit of the way to make me feel better, but a loss is a loss. It looms heavily over me.

I had fun though. I really enjoyed it actually. Eight weeks of preparation culminated itself in only two minutes of brawling. It felt like a short rollercoaster ride. I took a few days off and upon my return to the gym I found out that in 7 weeks there is another event that several of my friends are preparing for and I decided to take part. I felt good, energetic, in shape and ready to avenge my loss.

I started the following Monday. My trainer told me to take it easily due to having just had a fight. I reminded my sparring partner to go light three times until he threw a hard kick into my ribs when I wasn't expecting that sort of power or speed. I got out of the ring, partially pissed off that he wouldn't listen, partially concerned about injuring myself on the first day of fight camp and partially afraid of further bruising my ego. Maybe that's where my confidence started to falter.

Since then, I've done well. I train hard and I'm improving. I'm doing very well on the pads, in sparring and in conditioning. I got hit with a hard uppercut last week that caused me to take a 10-second time-out. It made me feel horrible that I had to do that, but the pain went straight from the tip of my chin into my ear. Last night I sparred and did well, except against a sparring partner who's got super fast hands, a reach advantage and amazing head movement. I got frustrated trying to catch him while simultaneous eating tons of jabs, but I managed.

Overall, I think I'm in great shape physically. I'm certainly doing better than I ever have done before. I'm a bit worried about my ability to withstand wild flurries like the one that caused me to lose my first fight and I worry about my ability to take a punch to the chin/jaw, especially as it feels like it's been tender recently from all the sparring. 

Then I think about the opponent and I consider that whoever it is can't be in a much different position from me. They train just as hard probably and statistically have no better or worse chance of winning. This uncertainty is not comforting and even though it may be realistic, I'd rather I had an unreasonable belief in my own superiority.

Final notes about the fight. 

I'm 30. 5'10"". Fighting at 160 lbs. 0-1 record.

New guy here, and i am very excited  to have my first MT class this Friday. Of course, I am being impatient and watching a lot of videos, hoping to get a feel for the footwork and such. I am not new to martial arts, I did tae kwon do for 10 years and had a couple golds at nationals and the us open when I was a junior as a black belt, so my kicking is at a very high level, but it's been about 5 years since training TKD so my flexibility has gone downhill. I also have 2 years of BJJ under my belt (I am 21 and currently train BJJ about 4 times a week and am a blue belt). I only had about 5 boxing lessons months ago, so I'm not even gonna try to start learning that on my own! However, I might be able to study the footwork or kicking and get a general idea of the similarities and differences with TKD and MT. I was wondering if anyone would have any tips or things to keep in mind? Also, if anyone has any videos that show some good footwork or possibly a MT fighter who also does TKD it would be much appreciated. I hope in a few years after getting my MT fundamentals I will be able to integrate some tricky uses of my TKD, if so I will be sure to share.

1372373866.0	1h7lyo	Starting a three-day intensive tomorrow, here's why...	OurLandsraad	5	3	5	"I know some of you have traveled all over the world, lived off nothing, or spent vast amounts of money to train. However, I'm going to a park, not 20 miles from my home, to train for 3 days straight, and I think it's important to talk about why. 

I'm going to be an instructor some day, I'm going to have my own gym, and I'm going to have a positive impact on my community. Right now, I'm merely a part-time student, who can barely train due to some nagging injuries. However, there comes a time when an opportunity to change your life is presented, and that opportunity has come for me. I played football for many years, stopped in college, and picked up Muay Thai in my early twenties. I had strength, I could endure pain, and I have a competitive nature, all things that made this martial art a natural draw for me. I trained five times a week, incorporated MT into every aspect of my life, and was really happy. However, due to my football years, and lack of supervision, I started using improper muscle groups for almost all of my techniques, and quickly pulled several muscles (at the same time). This lead to many years of semi-rehab (not a lot of funds), and brief stints in the gym, then right back out with the same injuries. I knew I was capable of becoming a serious student, but I just wasn't capable of healing properly. Next thing you know it's four years later, and I'm still in the same situation, wondering if I'll ever realize my dream.

In the midst of feeling like a POS, I start devising a plan to get back into serious training

Step 1: Discover exactly which muscle groups are F'd up.

Step 2: Find out which MT moved did the F'ing

Step 3: Repair the muscles (massage, acupuncture, foam roller, whatever I can get my hands on and afford)

Step 4: Get back in the gym and SLOW DOWN!!!

Step 5: Repeat

In the process of following these steps, I probably had about eight or nine mental breakdowns. One day I would think I figured out which muscle(s) were killing me, next day I'd have the same nagging pains. One week I'd have an excellent massage/acupuncture session, then immediately pull a muscle in class. I can't remember how many times a muscle would release and I'd say out loud ""That's it, I think the pain is gone!"" for it to simply return the next morning. However, through it all, through all of the shame, the doubt, seeing young guys in the gym move in ways that I haven't been able to move in years, I never thought about giving up my dream, and that's how I knew I had found my life's true passion. 

In the end I discovered I had knots in my hamstrings the size of baseballs, a left lat that, in combination with other woven in muscles, had been tugging at my lower spine, and lower abs so weak that I'm finding it difficult to even walking properly. However, all these things are being improved upon, and I haven't been out with an injury in months. Which brings me to the next three days-I'm going to spend every waking moment immersed in doing what I love, and I'm not going to take that for granted! I'm using this as a launching point to up my endurance, sharpen my technique, and reinforce the idea that this isn't just a hobby, it's a lifestyle. Also, I'm sharing this with /r/MT because I know there are others like me out there, who have all the passion, and good intention in the world, but have some seemingly insurmountable hurdle in their way. I want to let you know that you can improve, you can reach the next level, and we're all in this to help each other along the way. Have a good one r/MT, see you in the gym!

**Edit:** Made it back in one piece! This weekend was a really significant turning point in my career, as I've been able to develop a feel for my body that I've never had before. Working out for 6 hours every day really tells you a lot about which muscles you're using properly and improperly, and the exhaustion (as always) makes you use much better  technique. I absolutely took a risk buy taking a shot at this camp, but I was able to stay disciplined, listened to my body, and reap the rewards.

I just got deployed to the desert and my gym has a severe lack of any mma gear to train with. I used to do muay thai a year ago and have been wanting to get back into it ever since I moved away. I just got word that my unit is sending up a proposal to higher ups to be allotted funds to buy some new gear for the gym and I've been tasked to come up with some items online that could be ordered.

I was wanting to get a new heavy bag as well as some thai pads and boxing gloves, however, I've never bought my own training gear aside from boxing gloves. We're not going to be allowed to do any actual sparring for safety reasons, so we won't need the headgear/shinguards etc. Does anyone have any suggestions for what website to go through, what brand of punching bag to get (I was wanting to get the long skinny bag over the standard fat one) and what to get with the bag (mounting/stands/packing mats?) and also training pads like punching/kicking pads for 1 on 1 training?

1361588297.0	1926zu	Thaismai gloves review	ronin1031	7	2	2	"I did a [review]( http://www.reddit.com/r/MuayThai/comments/1922j1/online_store_review_for_muaythaifightingcom/) for an online store where I bought my gloves so I figured I may as well review the gloves too. There is a TL; DR at the bottom.

So here is my review for  [Thaismai 16oz Velcro-strap gloves]( http://www.muaythai-fighting.com/thaismai-boxing-gloves-velcro-attached-thumb-bg-124.html)
I will need to preface this review by stating a few of my biases;
1.	I much prefer muay thai style gloves, as opposed to boxing or MMA type gloves
2.	My previous pair of gloves were also Thaismai brand, so I’m comfortable with the feel.
3.	I ALWAYS wrap using 180” wraps (I do a Cambodian style wrap with lots of cloth on the knuckles and wrists, but not much across the palms. It may sound insignificant, but the wrapping style and length can change the way a glove fits). I also wrap my thumbs.
4.	I prefer, and am used to having the thumb of the glove free to move.


With that out of the way, let us begin.

Fit

I am a pretty tall and lanky character with wide hands, long fingers, but small wrists. To give you and idea my hand measures about 10.3cm or 4 inches across the widest part of the palm, and about 19.5cm, or 7 ¾ inches from the heel of my hand to tip of my middle finger. The gloves themselves fit very nicely, my hand doesn’t feel crushed and my fingers never feel jammed up. The gloves are snug enough that I would feel comfortable using them without wraps, but have enough give that, even with 180” wraps they don’t feel tight. I should say that the first use did cause some hand cramps, but after about 3 days the gloves were broken in.
The one down side is that the wrist support on the glove itself is lacking. I am chalking this up to fact that I have little-girl wrists that are 13.5 cm (or 5.3 inches) in circumference. Other people who have tried on the gloves have had no problems. I also used to use lace-up gloves, so the Velcro takes some getting used to. I always wrap up, so it hasn’t been an issue.
The glove does feel a bit loose at the wrist, but as I get better at tightening the Velcro, its less of an issue.

Feel

The gloves are 16oz, and I honestly had to get out a scale and test them, because they don’t look that much bigger than my old 12oz gloves. But they are nice and compact, hitting pads or a bag feels good and sturdy, even without wraps. There is very good air-flow through the gloves, something I never noticed before in gloves, and it is a great feature.  It is easy to make a fist, most of the padding is on the top of the hand to the fingers, but the thumb is very well protected and sits very nicely. I tested and smashed the bag thumb-first (re-creating the good, ol’ “oh shit, OH SHIT!!!” style hook) and didn’t feel any discomfort (except the embarrassment of deliberately throwing a poor hook).  The thumb is attached, and I’m not a huge fan of that, but it doesn’t really bother me. Didn’t even realize it was attached until the second day using them, and only because someone else pointed it out.
Kind of a side note, but the insides are very soft on the hands when you don’t wear wraps.

Performance

The gloves are well balanced for size and protection (of both wearer and opponent). They aren’t so bulky that I can’t slip them through a tight guard (a problem other fighters have mentioned with older Twins gloves), and they are comparable to the size of 12oz gloves, so if you fight in an amateur competition (around here, all done with 12oz gloves) the change won’t be that drastic for defensive postures. 
The Velcro strap is well designed and doesn’t (yet) protrude and scratch training partners during clinch, this is a big plus for me.
The fingers of the gloves have a good lip on them, I get a good grip in clinch and when scooping/catching feet, heels, legs, etc.
All in all, the gloves are flexible and dexterous.

Final thoughts

All in all, I’m really happy with the gloves, I was expecting to try them out and use the 30 day return policy and maybe try a few other brands, but I really like these gloves. For the money they are great fitting, feeling and preforming gloves. My last pair of gloves was also Thaismai and I bought them in 2005. They are still perfectly wearable (the only reason I’m not still using them is they are 12oz’s and I need 16oz) so I expect I’ll get at least 8 years out of these. Not bad for less than a $70 USD investment.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask in comments or PM.

TL; DR:
-Good fit, even for large hands
-Gloves feel great
-Could have tighter wrist strap
-Excellent hand protection
-Preform well
-Based on previous experience with brand, gloves are long lasting and reliable

So, a big warning to anyone buying gear from Thailand, they really don't seem to take risks with smuggling. They cut open one pad and slid a knife through the padding to check for contraband (drugs or jewelry, presumably) and stuffed it back into the parcel.

1353291146.0	13ffbl	Question or suggestions involving hanging bags	BigWill16	8	3	3	"Hey guys!  I'm expanding my gym and almost doubling my space next month and I'm in a bit of a bind.  I currently have bags hanging from a bag frame my dad and I built.  The problem with the frame is that there are 4 huge steel posts that are permanent and they limit our floor space for sparring, pads etc......

Did anyone here build their own brackets to hang heavy bags off of a wall?  The ringside/titlemma ones are too flimsy and the metal hook grinds down in less than 6 months.  So i'm pretty much looking for ""do it myself better"" type advice or links if anyone has any!  

Thanks guys

Big Will"	t5_2r60y	True
1351546356.0	12as6t	I just purchased a new pair of 16 oz gloves for sparring. They are super tight on my fingers. Do they need to be broken in first?	EdgarAllanFlacco	5	0	8	[I just bought these gloves the other week](http://www.mmawarehouse.com/Venum-Red-Devil-Boxing-Gloves---Skintex-Leather/ven-0316,default,pd.html) and after using them for some shadow boxing and light bag work I realized the gloves were squeezing my fingers (specifically my fingertips) pretty badly. My previous pair of gloves were cheap level 1 everlast boxing gloves and I did not have this problem. Do I just need to keep using my Venum gloves and break them in? Thanks in advance.	t5_2r60y	True

He's still a beginner but any time to give him some views and tips via YouTube comments would be appreciated. He progressed since then though. 

5 months of the real deal. I'm jealous as fuck.

I currently live in Saint-Petersburg, Russia, but I am thinking of going to Thailand for a month or so for an intense Muay Thai training. I have never tried any martial arts before. Can you recommend any place to go to?
The idea is to live somewhere I know no one and build up my body from the life-on-sofa thing I have now. This is kind of a mental and physical challenge I want myself to go through."	t5_2r60y	True
