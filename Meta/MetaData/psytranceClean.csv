As passionate about psytrance as I'm sure you all are, you understand how frustrating it is to not have many people around to talk psy with.

1340667228.0	vllcs	Horrible tragedy at Entheos Gathering in BC, Canada.  A man was killed at one of the most beautiful, intentional, responsible, loving and best organized gatherings I've ever been to, and we need some love and support from our global tribe.	djsunkid	26	3	19	"This really really sucks.  At least we had a festival with responsible organizers and a real sense of community.  Organizers, crew and volunteers have been working with the police since early Sunday morning to try and figure out what to do.  Just as one of our headliners hit the psytrance stage we were alerted as to what had happened.  I've never heard of anything like this happening to our tribe before.  We are absolutely shattered here in BC Canada.

We held a candlelight vigil at the fire area last night, and there was a touching ceremony yesterday afternoon at one of the stages.  We had some native elders give some prayers and a very talented singer performed a heartbreaking song to whomever committed this crime.  Actually, there was a lot of that ceremony dedicated to whoever did it.  Not in anger and hate, but in love and compassion.  

My favourite part of the very emotional closing ceremony was when one of our healers spoke.  He said that many of us will need support in the coming days and months.  He said that we are a community, and that he was sure that people would give their love and support, and asked for a show of hands, who would offer their love and support to those who needed it.  Every single fucking hand went up, 1100 people giving each other love and support.... it was very goosebumpy.  Very well played.  

We set up a counseling area on the grounds and put a call out to any and all healers that were on site to come and offer their assistance to those who needed it.  We had a ton of people going for help and a lot of people to offer those people help.  

From what I understand, the Entheos board of directors is still trying to formulate a statement for the media, but we are understandably afraid of what this might mean for the festival scene in our province in the future.

Personally, I'm incredibly shaken, saddened, hurt, confused, disappointed and afraid.  Entheos in particular and our culture in general has been talking about building communities of people, not just having oonce oonce techno rave parties in the woods.  This horrible tragedy represents a chance for our community to come together and act like a community.

I think that a listening club would offer us all the opportunity to understand psytrance more than already do. I know there's a wealth of information among us, I know there are plenty of people here who know and could explain things about production and the like if we could all get down to a focused discussion.

I think the best way to go about this would be to focus discussion on a single album/song, I think at first we should start with a single song, see how many people we can get to commit to listen to just a single song and come discuss it.

But, the tricky part is song selection, I personally don't think we should use a vote/election system for it, I think this will skew selection away from the obscure and different forms of psytrance.

Now, this is something we'll have to develop if this gets rolling at all, but to start, I propose a simple rule system about what is selected.

- A single user cannot choose the song more than once every 5 selections

- A single Artist may not be selected more than once every 5 selections

I think if this grows, then these should be moved to 10, but 5 weeks away from now already seems like some time so I vote we set it at 5 for now.

As for the selection, I'm still not sure, I'd like to use a random number generator, but I don't know how we could implement that in a group like this.

And finally, availability, I want the songs to be available to everyone, we could do youtube links, torrents or rapidshares, but actually let's just shoot for all 3 and see what we end up with.

Oh, go ahead and start suggesting for this week"	t5_2qq5p	True

I hope you enjoy. (And I hope I got the editing right the first time)

1367470116.0	1dj7zm	Religious iconography in the psytrance scene, what do you think?	squizzles	15	3	24	"This is probably more related to the Darkpsy and Psycore scene, but maybe it relates to many others, as well....

I have been in this scene since the late 90's, have thrown events for most of the years since, produce and DJ psytrance.  I say this not to boost my ego, but to just let you know that this music and this scene are my life and I mean no disrespect in asking this question.

Indian religious symbolism is obviously all over the scene.  I always found it interesting that a bunch of people, few of which practice or know anything about the symbols that they dance in front of, still go on putting the tapestries up and laying out the Kali and the Ganesha.  This isn't the only example, but it is the most prevalent.  

In a community that embraces all-inclusive events and creativity of thought and ideas, does the strong presence of Indian and other religious and pagan icons really lend to a general feeling of acceptance?  This especially goes for new comers.  

I would really be interested to know some people's thoughts on this."	t5_2qq5p	True

Plus, my favorite DJ there opened with Acid Rocker. I've never experienced anything like it since, and it will always be one of my favorite memories.

But, we've got our first selection!

This weeks submissions were:

1915 - Penta - Neurotic Call

2131 - neelix - leave me alone

2370 - Dirty Motion - Betelgeuse

3285 - Ray of Light - Y East

3558 - Sonic Anomaly (SOM Remix) - Psychoholic

4385 - Home Alone - Hujaboy

6426 - Shift - Synesthesia

8199 - This darkness Rastaliens - Fitz Fatz (Tryambaka Remix)

9277 - Dimitri DKN - Biorhythms (off Interrupted)

There were 2 submissions without a 4 digit number so I went to Random.org and added one to those.

And the Winning Number is 7237! here is the weekly raffle announce I kept secret to make the first raffle work, from now on we can just go with the weekly announce on this site.
http://www.techzoom.net/tools/random-number-generator.en

The closest to 7237 was Glorfindel with ""6426 Shift - Synesthesia"".

[Shift](http://www.discogs.com/artist/Shift+%282%29)'s real name is Chris How and he is a Psytrance DJ and producer born in Johannesburg, South Africa on 10th December 1978.

Note: To keep things simple we'll just start discussing this one in this thread here so feel free to start.

I will be posting a comment here later with a Draft of the guidelines to this weekly discussion, a template so that this can become a user run group. Everybody can then jump in on what they think about the draft and necessary changes will be made.

Please refrain from posting suggestions for next weeks discussion until the above draft of standard procedure is posted.

And finally, thank you to everybody participating! I look forward to what we can make out of this.

edit: we'll work on the formatting of these posts, this currently doesn't do much to highlight/spotlight the actual winner but it'll work for this week."	t5_2qq5p	True

ActionIan	10	2	29	"I have recently been getting into psytrance, especially after watching the live stream of Simon Patterson at ASOT 600 in Den Bosch. However I'm not exactly sure where to find more. What are your favorite tracks, or essential tracks for a newbie to hear? Is there anyone that is particularly influential within the genre that I should check out? I really enjoy the sounds and emotions that make up psy, and would love to discover more of it. Thanks guys!

Edit: Wow I didn't think this would get this much attention. Favorite tracks so far:

- Astrix - Acid Rocker
- Ace Ventura - Maximum Overdrive
- Laughing Buddha - The Acid Test
- Neelix - Expect What
- Whizzy Noise - Oceanica
- Motion Drive - Oscillation of Energy
- Flowjob - Mercury Calling
- Progenitor - Typical Human Behavior
- Inner State - New World Order

I'll update the list as I go through all the comments, you guys have given me a ton of artists and recommendations. Looks like I'll be spending quite a bit more time on this sub!"	t5_2qq5p	True

In two semesters, I have failed to find another dedicated psytrancer even though students come here from all over the world!

I went there to experience Hallucinogen Live, cause i though that was quiet hardcore and cool music. Then, when the darkpsy eventually hit mainstage i was blown away, it was way too crazy! i could allmost not handle it, then the entire crowd turned into zombies, they where rotting in front of my lsd-glaced eyes, theyre limbs started falling off. it was scary, but the zombies hadn't seen me yet so i keept a low profile and carefully danced my way out of the dancefloor under the insane roaring thunder blasting out of the speakers. I got out safe, then i remembered i was tripping and the zombies where just happy hippies hallucinatet into zombies and they where not going to do any harm, i was not sure about the music though, but i challenged myself to go back into the crazy zombieland. it was a thrilling experience! (then that crazy night continued into many eternities, but thats another story)... Next morning: didnt really like darkpsy, too wild, too evil for me.. but then some months passed and one day something on my inside wanted to hear those crazy sounds again. (it was like all of a sudden getting an urge to watch midgetporn, something you dont really like, but it makes some emotions spinn on the inside) Started liking it more and more, I couldnt wait to get back to Ozora to experience that crazyness again. 2009 came and Cosmo blew my mind! it was the greatest set i had ever heard, from that day on i was a darkpsylover! 
I dont think the music is evil, but it sure is badass! Its agressive and playfull, so you can playfully release out all your agression and negativeness while dancing to it, and thus its a cleansing experience!

TLDR: Once i was a curios boy on acid walking into a nest of Darkpsy Zombies, Now i am a Zombie too! &lt;3

Over the past three years i've attended parties all over Europe and Asia and I wanted to know how does the darkpsy scene in America stand up in compaprison to places like Russia, Portugal and India which are (in my opinion) the leading places for darkpsy in the world right now.

I know there are alot of darkpsy parties in the States and i'm a big admirer of the american darkpsy producers as well, (Mubali and Cindervomit rank among my favs.) But in terms of international musicians and dj's coming to perform, how is it?

I really don't care about the settings, decor and the ambience of the parties. All I care about is good music. 

A big thanks in advance!

1) I already had an extensive collection and figured I needed to listen to it instead of continuing to hoard.

2) Didn't have the time and patience to sit through a boatload of crap that started coming out all of a sudden to find that single good track or CD.

I've been to a couple of festivals and am amazed that I no loner recognize most of the artists in the line up.  So, help me save the time and suggest a couple of albums/compilations that have really stood out in your opinion this past year.
