1336149936.0	t7201	I'm a hacker, and I have some information for the community. AMA. 	Hackertrash	2873	1212	1345	"Throwaway, for obvious reasons. 

Hi, I'm a BF3 Player. One who 'hacks'. Some background :

When I'm legitimate (not hacking) I'm a ~400 SPM player, an active member of the reddit forums,  and everything I'm about to write is absolutely true. 

We've all met hackers in game. However, an IRL friend I know plays online games only to hack them. He introduced me to a relatively cheap, fairly well known and undetectable BF3 hack. 

I noted it's existence, but didn't use it, or think much about it - until one day a few months ago. 

I was on caspian, and a opposing sniper was clearly hacking. On a short ticket server he was 100-4 or so and was able to kill me across the map with impossible shots. 

I was infuriated, and in a bad mood. I cracked. I went to the hack website my friend had shown me, bought the hack, and over the course of a few days learned to use it. 

Here's the information I think the community at large ought to know.

**The hack works by injecting some code into the game as it launches.** As such, no files on your computer are altered in any way. I don't have a mass of technical knowledge, but I know this keeps PB and DICE/EA from being able to detect it. The executable for the hack doesn't even exist on your computer: You use a java applet to log in, and it loads it directly into memory and you launch the game afterwards. 

**The hack's capabilities are immense, and highly configurable.** There are so many options. The most notable ones are: 

* I can see the entire enemy team on the map, spotted, with ranges - all the time. 

* I can see who is aiming at me at any time, and the QUALITY of that aiming. (Remember this, I'll get to it's importance later) 

* I can set the hack to aim-bot on the push of a button, or all the time - or none. I can also set it to fire for me - but only when my crosshair is over a space that will result in a kill.

* I can set the hack key-binds, to toggle any option In the hack. 

* I can choose head, body, foot, or variable shots, as well as no spread. 

* I can set the hack so that ANY amount of damage kills a player (no matter where the bullet hits)

* I can set the hack to spot all members of the enemy team every so often, for the benefit of my entire team (spothacking).

* Finally, I can kill the entire other team with a touch of a button.

**They update the hack constantly.** It only takes hours between a patch and a new injectible updated version. 

The aim-bot specifically is extremely customizable: 
It can be set to only force aim at slow or fast or any speed in between on button press: It can snap to the closest enemy, or the one I have closest to my crosshair.

There are many more options, including being able to FULLY customize the  weapons (including vehicles) and others. Also - you can customize it so that all this information is invisible. None of this shows up on the PB screenshots. 

So after I got my hack all set up, I found the hacker, and went into his server, and began killing the shit out of him. 

At first, I just murdered everyone on my way to him, but once I became more skilled with the hack, I just used the 3-d and 2-d radars, along with the feature that showed me who was looking in my direction, to avoid the enemy team, and just kill the hacker. 

He rage-quit pretty quick. This lead to my next finding, as I turned on the hack when I suspected someone of hacking. 

There are many, many more people using some feature or form of this hack(or a similar one) on almost every server than I thought possible. 

What I mean by that Is I found that on nearly every 64 man server, during the course of a two round span, it's almost a certainty that someone is hacking - and most times more. 

Here's how I was able to know (not surmise) that people were hacking. 

The hack can be set so that when you aim near someone (whether you have line of sight or not), it will show you how close they are aiming to you - in a percentage. 

100% means that they are aiming at you, perfectly. Running around, watching people, I could instantly see some issues. 

As you would imagine, holding a 100% aim on a moving target is nearly impossible. But I found people, time and again, who, once they 'took notice' of me - 
Could hold that 100% as long as they wanted. 

In other words, they were seeing me (in many cases across the map from spawn, through buildings and the like) as soon as I spawned - and they had me dialed in, even as I ran, and changed directions. 

They were using their own hack to hold an aim on my head, as they got into range/line of sight. 

But furthermore, I started to notice something with lots of the vehicles and aircraft: plenty of those would be flying around, but as soon as they got anywhere near me, the aim percentage would go from 0% straight to 100% - and not release until they had fired all their rockets/guns/etc. 

This also revealed very excellent players in some cases being accused of hacking, weren't hacking. You could detect in the aim if it was 'human' or not. These cases, while fairly rare, did exist. 

Another clear way to tell is if someone was using the hack, is if I could sneak up on someone. Amazing players can be surprised, if you have the advantage of knowing where their entire team is, and what direction they are running and looking, at least some of the time. Hackers using the radar functions cannot be surprised. It was a dead giveaway

I did this for a month, before I removed my subscription to the hack, worrying that I would be stat-wiped, or banned.

 But during the month, I did a lot of looking into the profiles and statistics of the people I found to be hacking beyond a shadow of a doubt, and I reported a boatload of profiles (to nearly no avail) . 

Here's what I've found- (and mind you , this is a month of playing, I found maybe 100 people that were clearly and undeniably hacking for the above stated reasons). Take this with a grain of salt, sample sizes and unscientific record keeping means these numbers could be 10-20% (maybe even more?) off. 

~~* If you are over 700 SPM, you are probably (50-60% of the time) hacking.~~ 

~~* If you are over 900 SPM, the number is even higher- perhaps as high as 70%.~~

Due to comments and discussion I think this is a more appropriate way of quantifying this: 
* my anecdotal evidence is that between 1 in 30 to 1 in 60 players on big ticket servers are hacking. Also, many high SPM players (over 700-900) with low time on bases etc. are often hacking imo. 

* The vast majority of hackers aren't using most features of their respective hacks, the most popular hack I saw was the 'radar' or spothack. Aimbots are the second most popular - especially among snipers and engineers.

* Moreover, almost all hackers are 'closet' hackers. They aren't obvious. Also, I would call these people out, and almost universally they would turn it off instantly. 
(example, I find a hacker, call him one over chat, and he would call me a noob, or insult me. But after that, the hack in most cases would be disengaged - and often the person would leave the next round.) 

* Most people using hacks, once they turn them off, are no good. In fact, a reasonably good person (250~ spm or above) , given this hack, is absolutely unstoppable. I could easily go into a 64 man server, and have a KDR of 20-1 or more in that round, against even insanely good players. 

* Metro is a massive hotbed for hackers, as well as 64 man instant vehicle servers. 

I'm doing this because I want to convey to all of you the scope of the issue we face. 

Ask me anything about the hack/hackers in question. I'm not going to release the website , unless it's to a EA / DICE related person over PM - I don't want the hacks to spread any more than they do. 

EDIT: Formatting.

**EDIT 2: Post blew up. I promised I would give some screenshots tonight if it did, and it has. But I'm still at work. 
I've not forgotten about you all, but my responses may be spotty because I'm working.**

**EDIT 3: Yes, I am aware that I'm not actually any sort of a hacker, and I agree with your designations of script kiddie / cheater / etc. I used this designation in the post to help the BF3 community at large understand what I was talking about. I'd like to think I'm not a piece of shit as many have suggested, I felt like what I was doing was in the interest of helping legit players and understanding the other cheaters/hackers/script kiddies.**

~~**EDIT 4: For those asking for screenshots: http://imgur.com/XXXXXXX**~~
That's 15 quid outta my pocket, I hope you guys know how much I love you. 
Redacted, it's been noted that the hack can be found with scrutiny of the photos. 

**EDIT 5. So yeah, threats against me, white hats messaging me to have me come help them so they can see the hack try and learn to dev antihacks, some guy with the hack's website asking me to join IRC and making cryptic statements, I'm done. I just wanted to raise awareness about the prevalence of hacks in BF3, and I feel I've done that. I pondered turning the threats over to authorities, but i would rather just drop it all. 

To the black hats: I'm not joining IRC. Sorry. I fear retaliation.
To the white hats: As much as I want to help, I'm not willing to get myself involved. I have a real life to care about, seems like people are mad. 
To the people making not so subtle threats: Fuck you. 
To reddit: Keep doing whatchu doing. See you in game, and i'll probably get my face owned. "	t5_2rlua	True

Hailth	2270	906	380	"Here is the [source](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/forum/threadview/2832654489499878081/1/) **Note**: I am not the author of this beautiful post. It seems wirrew is condoning this thread for now, I'm sure the battlelog discussion is enough to manage.

*Here's the transcription:* **EDIT2:** Going to remove some of the linked post, like what you guys seem to dislike most, to make room for a list of Reddit's thoughts from the comments.

**GUI Design Concept**

- [Here](http://imgur.com/sZCEv) is the Battlefield 3 SPAWN MENU GUI concept. (KITS, SQUADS(VOIP), DEPLOY, SOLDIER, VEHICLES &amp; CHAT)

- [Here](http://imgur.com/ogg0r) is the Battlefield 3 IN-GAME HUD, Command Rose &amp; End of Round GUI concept. 


**Community Patch List**

**General Fixes**

- Fix the ”Black Screen” that occurs when spawning in or, entering certain vehicles. E.g. LittleBird F2-F4 positions. (Fades from black for about 0.5 &amp; 1 sec.)
- When spawning on a squad mate, allow the player to spawn in the same direction as he/she is facing.
- When revived, allow the player to DIRECTLY move sideways, to DIRECTLY get up(standing OR crouching), and to DIRECTLY move when you have stood
up(standing OR crouching).
- If spawn point is unavailable, DO NOT auto spawn on team base. Allow the player to choose a new spawn point instead.
- Add explosions to TV Missiles. ATM, [no explosion occurs at all.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSHIPt3olwk&amp;hd=1)
- ENTER button during killcam will exit the killcam and take you directly to the spawn menu. You will not be able to be revived after exiting killcam.
- Enable more/deeper ground destruction. [Alpha version was good.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zV2B59WxZ6M&amp;t=0m10s) **WARNING**: Loud audio in video. 
- Option for Command Rose to show up directly when ""Q"" is pressed, like BF2.
- Fix bug which makes you ""[lag-slide](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSHIPt3olwk&amp;hd=1&amp;t=0m25s)"" when moving sideways using the PK-A(3.4x)(also on .44) or the Russian 4x scope. 
- Revamp the Command Rose sound layers so it's on the top for everyone.
- Add blinking icon to player who yell for ammo, medic etc.



**Game Balance and Gameplay (Infantry &amp; Weapons)**

- Increase the damage of the Javelin against both armored and unarmored vehicles. ""1HitKill"" against Growler ITV &amp; VDV Buggy. 2 shots = 80 damage against
armored vehicles(First rocket = Disable). 
- Increase the total amount of Javelin rockets carried both when using ""Explosive Upgrade/SQD Explosive Upgrade"" and when not.
- ""1HitKill"" against Growler, Buggy, Attack/Scout helicopter and Jets using RPG7/SMAW.
- Slightly increase the damage of RPG7/SMAW against the front of fully armored vehicles.
- Allow the player to use the SOFLAM as a binocular(mobile) when zooming(pressing RMB). And place it as usual when pressing LMB.
- Allow the player to enter his/her placed Mortar(again) without having to pick it up first. 
- Allow the MAV to JAM the Mortar mini-map for 45sec. Distortion effect on the mini-map when ""in"" the Mortar. (Still need to wait 45sec even if you ""reload"" the
mortar.) 
- Add a ""tip on screen"" for Mortars, stating the buttons for smoke/explosives.
- Give more points for spotting enemies. 20 at least.
- Decrease the time it takes for the parachute to deploy.



**Game Balance and Gameplay (Vehicles)**

- Make it easier to drive the EOD bot(turning).
- Increase the acceleration and top speed of the HMMWV and Vodnik.
- Decrease the armor on mobile AA tank. 
- Increase the reload time on heat seekers for mobile AA tank.
- Increase the spread of gatling gun for mobile AA tank. (So it's only powerful at close to medium range.)

- Damage from TV Missile against armored vehicles: 70 damage.
- Increase the splash damage from TV Missiles so it kills infantry within 1m radius. 
- Decrease the Lock-On time for Guided Missile on Helicopter gunner, Jet and Scout Helicopter.
- Increase the damage from Jet's Guided Missile: 80 damage against fully armored vehicles .

LAV-25, AAV-7A1 AMTRAC, RHIB BOAT, M1114 HMMWV, GAZ-3937 VODNIK, VDV BUGGY, GROWLER ITV) . 25sec cool down before same person can ""give""
you transport points.

- Repair icon showed on HUD in vehicle when being repaired.



**General Gameplay Wishlist**

- [Two man jets](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZhctTqHf7Y&amp;hd=1); Pilots have gatling gun and heat seekers or rocket pods. Co-Pilot have ""free-cam"" and can switch to Guided Missile or TV-Missile. This could be an unlock for the existing Jets. Like the CITV station for tanks.

- [Smoke tail](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq7iwxoS4Hs&amp;hd=1) from the jet wings (Like BF2).
- Be able to throw C4s (half the length) as in BC2.
- Add the Black Hawk helicopter to the game. (Classic BF Vehicle)
- Light posts should be destructible by vehicles.
- Option for separate mouse sensitivity for jets.
- Give the ability to disable the Command Rose and only use the ""BC2"" Command system.
- Bring back the AT4 from BC2.



**Battlelog and Forum Wishlist**

used weapon.
- Be able to send PM's(Private Messages) to non-friends on Battlelog.
- Be able to view ""My Page"" on the Battlelog forum. Here you can see ""Created Threads"", ""Threads I've Posted In"" etc. 
- Links in Battle feed should be clickable.

**EDIT** Made room for the word of Reddit!

- 1HK on all vehicles when using a Javelin+SOFLAM combo seems to be a bit much. It's already enough to disable fully armored vehicles. Perhaps today's patch tweaks to the Javelin+SOFLAM combo will be enough of a buff.
- Mod Tools. Still sexy, still desired and especially to provide minor UI tweaks as seen above!
- How might the proposed UI scale for players that can't run the game in widescreen for whatever reason?
- The default faction pistols will not save properly in a loadout when changing teams, seems to be caused by their places being swapped based on the team. Simple fix.
- A very interesting idea: should vehicle spawn points be more dynamic within main bases to make it a little more difficult to baserape?
- Full screen map: press M once for enlarge, twice for full, thrice for normal.
- Console players need a way to exit a game at the end of the round as PC players do.
- 1HK at close range with snipers is still heavily debated.
- Adjust the HUD in some way so that floating objective locations don't occupy so much of your view. (Suggestions?)
- [Sort](http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield3/comments/n26q6/battlefield_3_gui_concept_community_patch_list/c35td3a?context=3) the available spawn points better.
- Add an easier way to exit a vehicle in a direction of your choice. Maybe based on the movement key(s) you are holding when exiting."	t5_2rlua	True

1345734937.0	yp5ye	Battelog Privacy NOW!	LevelCapGaming	2175	859	590	"So anyone who has been following my YouTube channel, ""LevelCapGaming"", will know that I have built a channel to over 110k subscribers in under a year with ONLY Battlefield videos. That's 14 million views that have promoted Battlefield 3. I believe this makes me the largest YouTube channel of exclusively BF content, and I do my best to keep the interests of the tactical BF3 players in mind.  I don't ask or expect DICE to reward me for doing this. I do it because I enjoy playing Battlefield 3, and learning and sharing my knowledge. I have managed to turn my hobby into a profitable full time job which I am incredibly thankful for.  
.  
I have never particularly wanted any sort of e-fame or recognition, but YouTube success will give you that whether you want it or not. At first it was somewhat cool to see people recognize me in-game and compliment me on my videos. But as my channel grew, in-game trolls became a serious issue. So much so that there are some things that I can't do in-game anymore without someone ruining my gaming experience.  
.  
One of these is flying helicopters, something which I consider myself and my gunner to be particularly good at, but all it takes is one trolling kamikazie pilot to ruin our day. Sometimes I can get one round under my belt with little to no trolling, but once I have been online for 20+ minutes there is a good chance that the trolling is about to begin.  
.   
This got to the point where I had to stop making one of my more popular weekly shows because I simply couldn't get enough good gameplay to show to my subscribers. This show was posted on the main page of Machinima, and really helped grow my channel and show BF3 to an audience of gamers that weren’t primarily BF3 players. It was hard to end the show.  
.   
Many of my subscribers suggested changing my name. So that was the solution I tried. Using a random combination of uppercase i’s and lowercase L’s for ""IlIlIllIll"" can make it hard to search for on Battelog. This slowed down the trolls for about a day. Then it ramped back up. Someone told me they found me through players that I play with. Apparently, you can track someone by just looking at their friend's Friends list. So I took the next step and removed all my friends from Battlelog. Then I removed my 5000+ fan platoon on Battlelog and changed my name again.  
.  
This slowed things down for about two days. Then BF3stalker.com found me and put me back up on the site for all trolls to see. Someone messaged me saying they had favorited a Battle Report with me so no matter how many times I changed my name, I would still be found by BF3 stalker and anyone else who simply favorited a game with me.  
.  
Others have suggested creating a dummy account. I really don't like the idea paying more money for a game that has made my job incredibly hard to do. Another issue with that is if anyone figures out my dummy account name then that's money down the drain as it will be impossible to hide it again.  
.  
Another suggestion has been to use my own server, use my popularity to fill it up and just ban trolls. The main problem with that is a lot of people who follow me are incredibly skilled players. If I had a 64 player Capsian Border game filled with elite players, I still wouldn't get any good helicopter gameplay as 32 players with good aim and RPG's would make quick work of us. Secondly, it's extremely time consuming and costs a lot of money for a 64 man server.  
.  
Critics of my complaints about stalkers have said it just comes with the e-fame and that I should just deal with it. I agree with that in part, but at the same time it's not like I’m being pestered in public.  It’s more like someone coming to my place of work and yelling in my ear while I'm trying to accomplish a task. What other types of fame let people ruin your work directly?..  
.  
Now, it's public knowledge that DICE is aware of Battlelog stalking. The YouTube community has made several outcries for a privacy option on Battlelog. Even DICE employees themselves have complained about being trolled every time they try to play. If you look at some of the more popular DICE employee accounts you will see that they rarely play, and I'm sure that stalking contributes to ruining their pubbing experience.  
.  
And it's not just people with reputations. Anyone can stalk anyone. If a hacker decides you're his target for the day or week, he can follow you around endlessly ruining your experience. I have never seen another game that makes stalking this easy. Battlelog gives stalkers many, many tools to find people -- some of which I'm probably still unaware of. Most forum threads asking DICE for privacy options are not initiated by YouTubers, but any player who has been stalked and trolled.  
.  
Now, previous arguments for privacy on Battelog have covered things like “it's the moral thing to do,” or “it will make the Battlefield environment a much friendlier place to play.”  Nothing has been done.  
.  
So allow me to try and appeal to the business side of things since I know DICE/EA can understand $ reasoning.  
.  
Ahem.  
.  
The lack of privacy on Battlelog is making it more difficult and sometimes impossible for people to promote your game. These people are often your biggest and most passionate fans, but because they are well known for supporting and promoting your game, their gaming experiences have gone downhill. For me, it has gotten to the point where I now dread joining a game, wondering how long it will take for a troll to ruin my game. I have even thought about trying to convert my audience to a different FPS game simply because things have become so difficult for me in BF3.  
.  
From a business standpoint, it makes sense to implement a privacy feature on Battelog. The YouTubers promoting your game will enjoy their work and be able to create better content. I have noticed that more and more channels that get big on BF3 start to incorporate other games into their lineup. I can't help but think this is partly inspired by their increasingly worse BF3 experiences due to their growing popularity and the proportional increase in in-game trolling.  
.  
We know that Battelog is designed to support the upcoming MOH game, and I assume it will carry over into the next Battlefield release. Why not implement privacy now? Show the community that you understand how lack of privacy ruins the gaming experience, and at the same time get more FREE promotion from YouTubers that would now be able to enjoy the game and make better content.  
.

TheOneBlackMage	1809	507	156	"**TL;DR:  [DICE has acknowleged the issue with sound cutoff/dropoff, so let's vote it up for priority.](https://getsatisfaction.com/battlefield3/topics/audio_sound_bug)**

For background, the problem is that during gameplay, certain (but not all) sounds will cut out.  You would normally hear your own gun fire, but other than that, it is completely silent.  In some cases, you will hear background fire from extremely far away, but the important audio of firefights near you, footsteps, vehicles approaching will be missing.  Background noises like breathing, walking through brush, and teammate comments are also missing.  
  
Rather than starting another one to complain about it, I did a lot of searching, and found the main thread on the GetSatisfaction forums, and it looks like DICE has acknowledged the issue, as of last month:

https://getsatisfaction.com/battlefield3/topics/audio_sound_bug

Since the issue has existed for such a long time, and has very few votes, it will probably take a long time to get lookd at.  For reference, game crashing issues have 7000+ votes, and is still only on the acknowleged list.  If we can get more people to vote it up, it should get better priority to be fixed - right now it only has 277.

Watch any pro-level game or any game of Rush... 95% of players go with Assault anywhere that's not a 64-man pub server game. And why wouldn't they? Tickets are a valuable asset, so reviving people is hugely important. But what if Assault players couldn't revive just everyone? What if there were kills people couldn't recover from? Enter the knife and the headshot: two types of kills that actually take some big skill to get consistently.


As it stands, the most benefit you get from headshot (without a sniper rifle) is an extra 10 points, and maybe a ribbon when you get 5 of them in a game. Not very exciting. What do you get when you creep in and get the super-cool ninja knife takedown you've worked so hard for? The same points as any other kill. Kinda weaksauce. What I propose doesn't provide such a simple bonus like maybe some extra points for those kills... no, instead you get a much more subtle reward: a permanent takedown.


How many times have you lined up a sweet sniper headshot from 500m away, get some cool bonus points and shit, but then look back and suddenly the guy is back on his feet because some Assault guy was close by? It's lame. 


Or how many times have you flanked around the enemy and took out a lone sentry with a silent stab to the heart, only to have everyone else at the objective know exactly where you are because a guy died without any shots being heard?


Or how many of you clear a choke point on Metro and finally think you have some room to push up to B, when suddenly everyone you just killed is instantly back in the fight, at 100% health and unfazed by your onslaught because of paddle spammers hanging out a few feet away from the action?

What I propose shouldn't break the Assault class: they can still revive people who die from body shots, explosions, vehicles, etc. Just not headshots and knife takedowns... is that too much to ask?


BAM! Rush becomes more popular because medtrains can't just push onto objectives through sheer numbers and reviving. BAM! Sniping becomes a much more valuable contribution to the team effort. BAM! You are acutally using the knife's ability to be silent to some sort of advantage. BAM! The game becomes a bit more realistic...

I would love it if you guys would post links to forum threads, youtube videos or any other medium regarding these things and sort of let the upvotes speak for the popular opinion :)

(If any admin could sticky this for today it would be much appreciated)

EDIT: wow I'm so glad I got your attention! Keep em coming! If possible please try to add a source(video, or whatnot) of the issues you list :)

EDIT2: If no reference video is available please try to give at least a little detail on the issue, ""Fix the 93R"" does not give me much ;)

EDIT3: Thank you guys very much! This is more or less exactly the sort of stuff I am looking for! I will compile the list tomorrow so keep em coming!

I used to be huge into Counter Strike and Counter Strike Source but my disability has gotten the best of me and I can't play that either. Unfortunately (or, fortunately if you think of it in that sense that what you don't know you can't miss), I have never been able to play any of the call of duty games but I have followed along and sincerely enjoying watching you guys. I have to live vicariously through you guys and your videos. Gaming used to be a huge part in my life so now I have gone from hard-core gamer to hard-core spectator. You all have seriously made me consider buying an adaptive control &amp; system, alas I haven't. So, from a fan of anyone who posts any kind of video, thanks, hope you had a happy holidays!


-Syd.






**EDIT 12/28 10 PM PST** Wow, I had no idea I would get this kind of support. Thank you everyone for all your well wishes and thank you for the gestures. I'm gonna head to bed, feel free to leave you're YT links, I will sub all of you and will do my best to watch all of your videos.



**EDIT 12/29 10 AM PST** Holy crap. I just woke up and this thread has absolutely blown up. I woke up and started watching videos and then [this happened](http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield3/comments/nuby8. /dear_people_who_post_videos/c3c67xp) anyways, I received a ton of messages over the night from a bunch of different people offering to record different footage of different games. I promise I'll try and do my best to get back each and every one of your comments. If you left a YouTube link, I will sub it by the end of the day.


On another note, to everyone who has offered to contribute to buying me the controller I mentioned, I'm not sure I can accept your generous offer. My number one hesitation would be someone buying that for me and I can't actually use it. The generosity of everyone here completely astounds me (in a totally awesome way). I used to play counterstrike in World of Warcraft religiously and have had many offers from friends and guildys to help me out with a purchase like this but in the end if it's something I couldn't do I would feel terrible. You all are great! 

Also, for those of you who sent me not so polite e-mails in a very rude way asking for proof [here is the video I sent to evil controllers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF9LSKeLSlQ&amp;context=C375c0a2ADOEgsToPDskIZPnklmjYm68rlgkH-LTjV) and it should be proof enough.

Because there is Sniper fire raining down upon my head and none of my inept goddamn scarf-wearing recons know how to fucking put that little red triangle over your head.  Because the rest of my team is making lol videos with their fucking MAVs and EODs.  Because it's not my responsibility to subsidize your inability to hit me once with your silenced .50cal with your goddamn 12x ballistic scope by ensuring the impossibility of my seeing you with naked eyes while I'm sprinting, uncovered to the goddamn objective you're not properly defending.  And let's not forget how open I'll be to shots from the side if I happen to engage in aimed shooting when I'm staring down a fucking green tunnel with no peripheral vision.  So I'll turn off the IRNV and maybe my speakers, too, so I can't hear the approaching MAV that's about to run me over while some asshole who I can't see spams me with fucking mortars from God-knows where.  That should make the game more fair for you.        	t5_2rlua	True

I get out to repair the damage, when ""teammate"" Jl2020 (PSN) comes up in the other M1 and drives around me, promptly disabling his M1.  Without an enemy in sight, he then dismounts and ganks my ride, which is not yet fully repaired, and drives it into another mine.  He pauses but doesn't dismount, as if waiting for me to repair, but was so pissed I let him continue with the now-borked M1 while I typed out a profanity-laced PM.

1328639104.0	peypy	VOIP, Battlecorder, Spectate Mode, New UI...  I will not buy any future DLC until these exist.  For a next gen FPS these should have been standard.	diggizsofuckinggay	1528	611	532	"People can say I'm spoiled and acting like a child for complaining about a video game, but honestly lets look at why implementing these should have been standard:

VOIP:

If BF3 can have VOIP on Xbox and PS3, is it really that much harder to add on PC?  I don't know how much coding goes into that but given there are so many VOIP programs I can't image it would be too difficult to integrate into the game.  If BC2 had it, why remove it?

Battlecorder:

Remember Halo 3.  That came out in 2007.  Thats 5 years ago.  It was the first FPS I believe that had an awesome Battlecorder.  COD has had one for the last 2 games.  Again not sure how hard it is to code one, but its been done before.

Spectate Mode:

This is an easy one.  Dice can make the incredibly annoying and stupid 3rd person after the fact kill cam, but can't make a spectate mode?  Needed for hacking prevention and competitive play.  Counter Stike had this in 2000.  Thats 12 years ago.  Isn't this standard by now?

New UI:

There have been countless UI designs that should have been implemented very early on.  ""Hey but we switched the join button location"".  Not good enough.  UI implementation should not be hard.  How did the current one even get approved.  Something like 5+ clicks to change gun accessories.....retarded.

Please DICE.  You have made one of the best games ever but its lacking some major shit.  Please don't put an hour of effort into new DLC when you haven't addressed some of the basic issues of this game.

So with all the ribbons and medals in BF3, why didn't they include one for spotting to get people in the habit? The 10 points you get currently does not seem to provide enough incentive for people to want to or care enough to spot. The fact that it helps out your entire team should be enough of a reason but I digress. And if I've learned anything from my 15+ years of gaming it's that you can take the most boring, repetitive task and make it seem like fun by creating ""achievement"" based on incremental progress. So rather than just giving players 10 points each time, make them work towards a goal (something high, at least 5,000 spots per medal)...I really think it would increase use of the spot function and help ingrain it into people's subconscious.

1333170977.0	rm20a	Dear DICE, please balance the console and PC versions of this game separately.	linerstank	1291	431	447	"is it too much to ask for? the gameplay environment of a 24 player game (12v12, ala consoles) is so much different than the gameplay of a 64 player environment (32v32). a ham-fisted, one patch for all approach not only doesn't make sense, it's just dumb to to even think that it would work.

case in point, check out the new patch. PC armor and helicopters are basically free points to the lucky engineer who pulls out his jav/RPG first. engineer is, by far, the most used class in the game -- i've seen matches were 20 people on my team were playing it. 20 people all armed with anti-vehicle weaponry that DICE buffed CONSIDERABLY in this patch (stingers and javs got huge buffs while the nerf to tank armor effectively buffs SMAWs). the result? a single engineer is fully capable of fighting a tank crew 1v1. 

let me say that again. ONE engineer vs ONE tank...and the engineer has a very real (and very good) chance to come out on top. two RPGs to the front will disable the tank, then it's just a matter of flanking around and hitting the back. a team of two engineers will beat any armor, no questions. that is absurd, borderline ridiculous, and inexcusable. 

for console users, i can understand the need to buff anti-vehicle weaponry. 12 users on a team, typically 4 or so already in vehicles, so that leaves 8 on the field, which probably mean's about 4-5 engineers. that is a very small amount of engineers to deal with a large amount of vehicles, so i understand the need to make an individual engineer more powerful against vehicles, lest the vehicles run rampant. but the PC version is 32 players on a team, WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF VEHICLES AS THE CONSOLE VERSION. thus, vehicles deal with ~20 enemy engineers on a team and each engineer is fully capable of soloing a tank or armor. where is the balance?

i am all for more people enjoying Battlefield but i am not for being abandoned and treated like a second class citizen. i understand consoles are more popular than PCs etc...but that doesn't mean my game should suffer. console game dynamics just don't apply to the PC game (unless it's 24 players). DICE has basically given a middle finger to the PC crew with these patches that basically push the game to infantry only.

PLEASE NOTE: i am not a PC elitist at all but i ask that console users refrain from giving anecdotal evidence in favor of the changes. my very point is that the changes are balanced for your version of the game but laughable for the PC version. two different game environments require two different balancing acts."	t5_2rlua	True
1332038978.0	r1kuc	I have one simple request for DICE.  Can we please be allowed to exit the game, during the between match loading screen?	Augustus_Trollus_III	1141	276	231	"   Why would I want this?  Granted this is a *minor* annoyance, but  when I'm playing bf3,  I want to play bf3,  not wait around for the next round to exit.    Here's my main argument:


- If a person wants to exit and do something else (different game mode / rage quit / etc),  that person is going to do it regardless if you gently nudge them into the next round (as I suspect this was the reason).

- Games like COD4 allowed you to back out quickly.  It's just a small little thing that allowed you more freedom.  Minor, but increased the addiction rate  of the game. 

- I think it would help prevent uneven teams at the get go.  If people back out at the outset,  you'll get a bit of a lopsided game.  Let players back out at an appropriate time - the loading screen (when no game has started).

ArmoredCavalry here, bringing you a BF3 Premium Giveaway for PC!

For those unfamiliar with myself or my site, I run [CheapShark.com](http://www.cheapshark.com), a site which keeps track of prices on digital download sites (Steam, Amazon, Gamer's Gate, etc.), to make sure you get the best price on PC games.

I've done quite a few giveaways in the past, including the ""Great Steam Game Giveaways"" over on r/gaming, here was the [last one](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/vblz5/the_fourth_great_steam_game_giveaway/).

With ArmoredKill fast approaching, I decided a BF3 Premium Giveaway was in order!

**The Giveaway**

So, how do you enter for a chance to win? That part is easy. Just submit your reddit username to the official entry form here:

~~OFFICIAL ENTRY FORM~~ (Entries now closed)

That's it! As long as your account is more than a day old, you are automatically entered for a chance to win. Also, please only submit one entry, as any duplicates will simply be tossed out. The winner will be chosen randomly and announced here (as well as PM'ed) 2 days from this post's creation.

Also, if you do enter the giveaway, *I humbly request you consider* upvoting this post!

So, thanks for reading, be sure to check out [CheapShark](http://www.cheapshark.com) or the [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/cheapshark), and good luck to you all! Depending on how this giveaway goes, I'll look into doing more like them in the future, here on r/battlefield3.


---------------------------------------------

Update: Just to clarify, this giveaway is for the premium add-on on PC. However, if you win and do not own the base game, and are willing to wait for the release of Battlefield Premium Edition (mid-September), then that can be arranged as an alternative prize.

Update #2: **70 entries so far but only 13 upvotes? Please consider upvoting this post to show your support if you enter the contest!**

Update #3: After reading through some feedback on the site, two things I saw people asking for that are actually already on the site:

1) You can setup email alerts for when a game goes below a certain price (see the envelope icon on the browse page, or (i) information icon on the home page

2) Also from the (i) information icon that you get when hovering over games, you can view whether a game is the cheapest it has ever been (historic pricing), and whether the store you are looking at is the cheapest current place to buy.

**Mega Update**: Crash has given me a number of keys to give away, the easiest way is for you to just grab them below (Thanks DICE!):

***Preliminary:***

The objective of this series of guides is to take the weapon data from Battlefield 3, wonderfully charted by Symthic [here](http://symthic.com/?s=bf3&amp;sb=dmgchart), and turning into a series of suggestions on how to best use each weapon. This could be useful for completionist trying to figure out how to best use each weapon on their way to service stars, or for anyone that has a playstyle in mind and wants to use whatever weapon which will complement them best.

I'm going to split this up into seven or eight total self posts for a couple reasons. One, so I don't have to continue into the comments, which can get messy. Two, so the comments can pertain to each specific class of weapons.

Symthic's data is based upon the latest PC patch, which might be different from consoles', but as I plan to rarely go into the specific numbers, the suggestions should still be applicable.
****
***Basics:***

In my opinion, guns have two components that largely differentiate one another, recoil and spread.

**Recoil:** how much the aim ""kicks"" when you fire. There's a static amount upwards for each shot (vertical), plus an amount left or right (horizontal), different for each gun. Note that while vertical recoil can be accounted for with skill by moving your aiming reticle while firing, horizontal recoil is a random amount to the left or right, and some guns on average pull to one side (usually the right) more than the other. Furthermore, each gun has a First Shot Recoil Multiplier. For most guns, it's around 2, meaning the first shot of a burst has double the recoil. Some have a high value of 3, some have a value of 1 which means the first shot's recoil is no different than any other shot. Recoil decreases at a different amount per second for each gun.

**Spread:** how big your reticule is (even while aiming, they just hide it). There's a spread min and max, which depends on the gun, if you are aiming or firing from the hip, and if you are standing, crouching, or prone. Spread min is the spread your first shot will have (You can think of this as your starting spread), spread max is the highest it can get while firing full-auto. Spread increase is how much the spread increases after each shot. Spread decreases at a constant value per second for each weapon.

Other stats are still important, and noted here for completeness and consideration.

**Damage:** How much damage each gun does per shot. Does max damage up to a specific distace, then decreases linearly to a minimum damage at a further specific distance.

**RPM:** Rounds per minute, or firerate, how fast a weapon fires. While higher does more damage per second, lower is usually easier to control and thus more accurate.

**Suppression:** How much a gun suppresses the enemy per shot. Bigger guns suppress more, though RPM is imporant, too.

**Bullet velocity:** How fast the bullet travels. Since bullets drop at a constant acceleration, you can use physics to determine how far you need to lead your target, and how much higher you should aim at range. Higher velocity is easier, and thus better.

**Bullet range:** How far the bullet will travel before disappearing. Values seem high enough to not really make a difference, in my opinion. Just don't try to snipe someone across the map on Caspian with a pistol, it's literally impossible.

**Magazine size:** How many bullets the gun can hold.

**Reload time:** How long it takes to reload. Reloading an empty magazine is longer, something much longer, and is best not to do. The reload animation for most guns can be cancelled early and retain the benefit of reloading, watch your ammo counter to see when this happens.

If you want more detail for any of this, I encourage you to check out Symthic's charts I linked above.
****
***Attachments:***

I'm starting here because I will be referencing the attachments in later posts, and they all reference different aspects of a gun's stats. Most attachments modify stats the same way across all guns, but there's a few important exceptions.

Note: Support gets Extended Magazine as a tertiary attachment. PDWs get flashlight and laser sight as secondary, and maybe Extended Mags are tertiary, I need to confirm this.

**Primary attachment:** *Scopes:* Ironsights/Holo/Red Dot scopes have the quickest time to scope in, but are short range. The 3.4x and 4x scopes have longer scope in time, but actually have zoom. Scopes 6x or more have the longest scope in time, a glint that gives you away to enemies, and weapon sway that can be circumvented with the hold breath button. IRNV scope adds a virtual sandstorm to your environment. This is largely up to personal preference, what range you want to be most effective at, and what range the gun you are using is realistically most effective at.

**Secondary attachment:** Foregrip, Bipod, or Extended Magazine. Also Underslung Rail for Assault, or Straight-Pull Bolt for Recon bolt-action rifles.

*Foregrip:* Decreases horizontal recoil by half. For Support weapons, it also reduces vertical recoil by a third. For the Recon's semi-auto rifles, is reduces horizontal recoil by about a third instead, and reduces vertical recoil by a little bit. Zero downsides.

*Bipod:* For Assault and Engineer, reduces your recoil and halves your minimum spread as well as your spread increase per shot. For Support, vertical recoil and spread are brought to extremely low values, and horizontal recoil is somewhat lowered. Note that the M60 actually gets increased horizontal recoil for some reason, this might be a bug. For Recon, reduces vertical recoil and spread increase, and decreases minimum spread on the SKS (it's already 0 on the other rifles when you aren't moving). Useful on bolt action rifles due to it eliminating scope sway. Downside is that the bipod sometimes doesn't set up when you want it to, and it sometimes does when you don't. (Pro-tip: If you move a little while zooming in, you won't deploy the bipod. Really helps to control when you use it.)

*Extended Magazine:* increases your maximum magazine by 50% or 100%. No downsides.

*Underslung Rail:* Allows you to attach the M320 grenade launcher or the M26 shotgun to most of the Assault rifles. While not necessary to use these weapons, it allows you to use your flashlight or laser sight attachments with them.

*Straight-Pull Bolt:* Allows you to fire multiple rounds on Recon bolt-action rifles without unscoping.

**Tertiary attachment:** Flashlight, Laser Sight, Flash Suppressor, Heavy Barrel, or Suppressor

*Flashlight:* (Can be turned off/on) Blinds your enemies! Blinds your allies! Gives you away from far away if you forget to turn it off.

*Laser Sight:* (Can be turned off/on) Reduces minimum spread WHEN FIRING FROM THE HIP ONLY. Kind of blinds enemies, but can also gives them a heads up that someone is aiming at them. Gives no bonus when aiming down the sight, so you should probably turn this off when you're going to be shooting long-range. I'm talking to you, Recon.

*Flash Suppressor:* Hides the flash when you fire, but increases how quickly your spread increases when you fire, as well as increasing your max spread. As long as you fire single shot or in short bursts, you'll mitigate the downsides. Even then, I've never actually used this, as the upside seems way too minor. Maybe it's better than I think?

*Heavy Barrel:* Reduces your minimum spread when you are aiming down the sight. The tradeoff is that it increases your vertical recoil a little, and it increases how quickly your spread increases by quite a bit.

*Suppressor:* This does a lot. On the plus side, it decreases your minimum spread by just as much as the heavy barrel does (unless it's on certain PDWs where it has a lesser effect), but it actually decreases vertical recoil by a little, instead of increasing it. It also does not reveal you on the minimap while you fire. The downsides are that your initial spread while firing unaimed is higher, and your bullets travel slower. This means you have to lead your targets more at range.  
Finally, it does NOT decrease your damage, it decreases your damage minimum and maximum range. That means your max damage starts dropping off at a shorter range, and reaches your minimum damage at a shorter range as well. In effect, this only changes damage at midrange. Up close, you are still at your max damage. Really far away, you are at minimum damage either way, you just have to be better at leading your target.
****
Phew. I think that's it.

For my money, I attach the 3.4x/4x scope, foregrip, and suppressor to any weapon when I can. It's the all-purpose good at everything loadout, and I need a compelling reason to use anything else. But those exist! And I'll get to them.

Sorry that I haven't been on as much lately. Been working crazy hours for launch, but I'm planning to resume max-crashTime with you guys soon.

Keep it coming!

1364497349.0	1b6ylp	"I just want to say, despite all the bitching and ""flaws"" in BF3, this game is brilliant and DICE did a great job."	Tustiel	1042	266	289	"It's been about 18 months and this game is still rocking.  Look at how many servers are active at any one time.  It'll definitely keep going *at least* until the release of BF4.

There are 29 maps to chose from and you can pretty much do whatever you want.  Infantry only?  BF3's got your back.  Air vehicles?  Yep.  Tank combat?  Not a problem.  Sniper rifles, shotguns, PDWs, assault rifles it's all there.  Conquest, Rush, TDM, CQ Dom, AS, TS, CTF, Gunmaster, Scavenger.  Core, Hardcore. ""Have It Your Way""?  Burger King can only *dream* of having it this good. 

And the assignments.  I've fucking hated some of the assignments but they've *made* me try weapons I never would have tried and with a few exceptions I've been converted.  

The graphics are great, the destruction is awesome.  The audio is so good I've been saved soooo many times by *hearing* someone sneaking up behind me or on the floor above me.  Suppression has saved me and killed me.  I've nailed some awesome kills, dropped jets out of the sky with the tank main gun, headshot guys on the back of quadbikes with sniper rifles (and I am a fucking terrible sniper), C4'd guys chasing me out of the East Door on Metro as I've tried to break for Alpha and killed the same guy SIX TIMES with claymores IN EXACTLY THE SAME PLACE THEY WERE LAST TIME (gotta love dumb bastards).  I've raged so hard I thought I was going to pop a blood vessel.  I've been shot from behind cover.  I've been killed by grenades when I'm on the red stairs on Metro and the grenade is above me and there is no fucking way I should be getting any frag down here.  I've popped flares and ECM and still been shot down.  Some ""hacking son of a bitch"" has headshot me from 3 miles away (okay, he had about 67 SS with the M98B, but still, loser.... ;)  )

And you know what?  I'd do it all again.  For all the bitching about nerfing and buffing and suppression and glitching and whatever else we've found frustrating over the past 18 months, this has been an awesome ride.  Thank you, DICE.

EDIT:  The bit that really makes me laugh (and I should have added this in at the beginning) is that if BF3 was as bad as all the haters keep saying it is, why are they still here?  18 months down the line and they're still subscribed to this sub and they're still playing it, while telling the rest of us how shit it is, listing it's numerous flaws.  If this game was as bad as they make it out to be then (unless they're masochists) why are they putting themselves through so much pain and frustration?  I suspect it's because even for all the ""faults"" this is still the best damn FPS out there and they know it, but heaven forbid they give credit where it's due."	t5_2rlua	True

**Second:  
This patch is the last thing that is to be accepted.  
A message to DICE: THIS IS NOT A WAY TO TREAT YOUR CUSTOMERS!**  
Enough is enough, and I think a lot of people agree with me, for the first time ever hopefully outside MordorHQ. Yes I said MordorHQ, don't ban me for this again.  

* Let's see what this patch broke and what could have been prevented:  
*Allmost all iron sights OR sights on snipers are absolutly broken, useless and not working.  
These snipers are affected:  
mk11, sks, qbu-88, L96, m417 and the JNG-90  
The QBU-88 is a special case, it has an effect of bullet rise. Or well, the barrel is ABOVE the sight.  
*Video:  
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS_3VbRHKYQ&amp;feature=youtu.be*  
* **Also the AUG is (again) broken.**  
This time with the m26. My favorite Assault Rifle and underslung are now USELESS.  
*http://imgur.com/a/mFDKm#1  (Screenshots)*  
* **And the last of the top of my head:**   
The completly broken Mobile Artillery Proximity Defense.  
Why did this pass QA for godssake!?
*http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkodIjWclbQ&amp;feature=youtu.be*  
  
I'am sure that many Redditors know of this problem. (Since they are on  the front page.) But DICE hasn't commented on ANY of these problems.  
**This is unacceptable.**    
I thought DICE was in liberty of speaking to the community EA?  
If so, why haven't I seen Crash or Zh1nt0 our 'Community Managers' since ages?  
Why even waste the money on them if they don't have an actual job to do except from Twitter everyday?  
Hell you can hire me then!  
(I have a lot of respect for both Crash and Daniel Zh1nt0 Matros, and I know they can't comment if EA doesn't let them.)  
Thanks for reading and thanks for possibly agreeing.  
**Reddit, MordorHQ, Battlefieldo and every of the 15 million Battlefield 3 players, unite. It's time. PITCHFORKS FOR EVERYONE!** *Let's get this to the frontpage of EVERYTHING INTERNETS. We must show that this is not a proper way to treat customers.*  
* **Demands:**  
* *Find a better QA team or make it bigger.*  
* *-EA will give the liberty to Daniel 'Zh1nt0' Matros and Crash our community managers to talk to us more openly and about everything DICE is doing (Only limiting to the games already released of course.)*  
* *-BETA Patch Servers, no XP, DICE servers which will be open for everybody on PC if you install the BETA patch. This of course will be a seperate Origin game, something like: Battlefield 3 BETA Patch Client.*  
* *-Working PC fuctions like commo-rose, VOIP and a proper teamplay Squad Leader. Can't believe I allmost forgot this one, I've probably got used to the mindless meatgrinder Battlefield turned into.  
We need a proper commo rose, with text messages in the chatbox of what you say. Right now you'll mumble: backup... Which nobody hears, that's why we need the location on the map+ a chat message in the chat on PC.  
Also a commo-rose on Xbox/PS3 would be very good.  
Squad Leader tools: Basic things as setting waypoint's, requesting anti armour, asking other squad leaders to attack a point, basic stuff. You did this before DICE, look at BF2.  
VOIP, important, Battlelog VOIP sucks. We can only talk to friends, which we have 3rd party programs for like Ventrillo, Skype, Teamspeak and Mumble.  
We need atleast Squad VOIP build into the game just like the consoles. I thought PC was the lead platform, wasn't it?*
     
EDIT Important: Basicly what we need is a no XP test server on PC, maybe some only Rush, some only Close Quarters etc. (Of course it shouldn't be possible to play the new maps but still.)  
We just need to test this, 100 QA guys is not enough to get full blown community of what 15 million?  
We got 15 million FREE QA TESTERS EA/DICE. Wake up!


*EDIT credit to Mister Yayparties:*  
* **IN GAME PROBLEMS:**  
Sniper rifles that needs their iron sights realigned are: mk11, sks, qbu-88, L96, m417 and the JNG-90  
When switching between co-ax LMG and shells, if I don't stop shooting the LMG and change to shells, it will continuously play the LMG firing sound. Can be stopped by changing to LMG again, and firing a short burst.  
Some game sounds go away randomly and then come back. Examples[1]  
On Close Quarters maps you hear footsteps/shots/shoutings from over and under you as if they were on the same level.  
SOFLAM hitbox needs to be fixed especially when on an incline  
TUGS hitbox is placed too low and causes bullets to miss when aimed at the top half  
The Conquest Domination Flags' Hitboxes are broken http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoaMbeS9GY8[2]  
The repair tool plays the igniting sound when pulled out but doesn't appear lit until you start to use it.  
Fix the Knifing dead zone on players using the Mortar http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBSxvR02YpM#t=5m33s[3]  
If menu is displayed while waiting to respawn and are revived the menu remains displayed. (Can be fixed by pausing and unpausing.)  
When you equip the M26 Slug to the AUG, it hits significantly higher than where you're aiming http://i.imgur.com/hfHmC.jpg[4]    
Tanks slide around on inclines uncontrollably (Never had this problem with BC2)  
Vehicle Collisions whether with friendly or enemy are very glitchy and cause rubber banding.  
Enemies vaulting over obstacles perform the climbing animation, then suddenly teleport 10 feet ahead.  
When spawning after changing the attachments your weapon will not be visible and you cannot shoot for a few seconds.  
M320 Smoke can still be spotted through and does not remove spotted objects within its radius. (It IS possible because it was done in BC2)  
Claymores and C4 all disappear on death but should instead stay until the player respawns so that they remain when you are revived.  
Stationary launchers make a firing sound when entered but don't shoot anything.  
Stationary launchers consistently make reload sounds when not occupied.  
Teammates can indefinitely delay the respawn of vehicles by placing Friendly Vehicles where the vehicle will spawn.  
Vaulting through Windows is very glitchy and most of the time won't work.  
You are not able to spawn on your own spawn beacons unless you are in a squad.  
Your soldier will call out ""enemy spotted"" if you spot a recently killed enemy soldier.  
When you have the AN-94 equipped and you switch to your secondary and back to the AN-94 without firing your sidearm, half of the barrel disappears. http://i.imgur.com/VpuPt.jpg[5]    
The MP412-REX has a texture bug where the ammo cylinder and/or ammo disappears.   http://i.imgur.com/AfSjr.jpg[6]    
Almost every time I use the mortar there is no shell in the hand I am dropping shells into the mortar with (i.e.. invisible mortar shells).  
When joining a game with a squad of friends they get put on different teams or squads.  
Teammates appear as enemies with the MAV http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MopXYYiL-aw[7]  
SOFLAM locks on to closer objects rather than those at the center of aiming reticle  
Players still aren't awarded kills for blowing up explosive red tanks near enemies.  
MVP &amp; Ace squad is awarded after 2XP is applied  
Reactive armor on the outside of the tank is not visually accurate but the 3 lines on the Tank HUD are.  
Proximity Defense on the Mobile Artillery damages the driver to 1% health.  
* **Rare Occurrence Bugs:**   
TV missile/Tank Shells randomly don't do damage on impact to vehicles. (15-20% of the time)  
TV missile randomly can cause the chopper to lose control and crash  
Loadouts sometimes change randomly for vehicles  
Sometimes the gunner dot crosshair doesn't show in transport heli  
Sometimes the 'repair circle' does not show when repairing vehicles  
Sometimes the javelin the target box doesn't appear even when receiving acquire and lock tones.  
Sometimes when killed in the mortar my soldier stays in the mortar looking out with the mortar map up. Can only be fixed by pausing and quitting the match. (Suicide won't work)  
Newly spawned tanks will sometimes not have any vehicle upgrades available (Damavand Peak Tank after the base jump)  
Sometimes when exiting a vehicle your soldier's gun makes a firing sound but doesn't actually shoot.  
Sometimes when reloading no animation occurs even though sound plays and the reload counter updates.  
Sometimes shotguns get stuck in reload loop without actually reloading http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H6xy0SrlJI[8] (campaign video, but always happens in multiplayer)  
Sometimes, upon being revived, a player has his primary out and all weapons reloaded. It acts almost like a respawn. (Been happening with the most recent patch)  
In vehicles with Zoom Optics when switching between zooms (or guided missiles in jets) the animation keeps a super zoomed in view but gains the turn speed of an unzoomed view. Alternatively tank gunners when in an unzoomed view the HUD will appear shrunken to 50% in the middle of the screen.  
There is a little artifact in the bottom of the screen in the form of a line of ""static"" often (Also unknown cause).   Appears centered about an inch from the bottom and never gets close to the sides of the screen.  
Sometimes medals/ribbons stay displayed until you die reducing your field of vision on PC.  
Sometimes the music leading to the last ticket plays continuously through the round review.  
Sometimes when climbing ladders you cannot turn your soldiers head to look around.  
* **BATTLELOG PROBLEMS:**  
The M4 &amp; M16A4 are listed under the unlock progressions for the engineer &amp; assault classes respectively but not in the overall weapon statistics list  
The M9 Bayonet is no longer listed anywhere on the weapons page  
The Medals and Ribbons page aren't organized in any type of logical order or layout.  
MVP and 3rd MVP 10 Ribbons Dog tags are switched. (compare with the MVP medals)  
USAS-12 Proficiency Dog Tag shows a SPAS-12 with a folded stock.  
Note that all of the following stats are easily accessible on BF3Stats.com and yet are not shown in Battlelog under the T-Chart at the bottom of the Weapon Statistics page under ""Kills | Performance"".  
Neither kill assists nor target designations are shown for the SOFLAM.  
Number of EOD Bot Repairs are not shown. (However Kills are shown)
Neither Kills nor Repairs are shown for the Repair Tool.  
Number of Radio Beacon Spawns are not shown.  
Kills are not displayed for the Defibrillator. (However Revives are shown)  
Also check out INDGamers youtube QED playlist[9] for all the other BF3 Map glitching and Gun Exploits that need to be patched.    
EDIT2: Check out INDgamers mentioned above because they provide an ridicilous amount of game breaking glitches on their YouTube channel. They even got out of the map on Close Quarters AFTER it had been 'patched.'  
  
EDIT: Sitting down after 10 hours and 555 upvotes to fix this post. It's not really pretty. ;)

**I also moderate /r/battlefield these days. And I still happily take questions REALLY! Don't be afraid of asking.** - Added 17/04/2012, or 04/17/2012 if you're so inclined, or 2012/04/17 if you're THAT guy... This guide is getting a slow rework for the /r/battlefield wiki, alongside similar content for every other game, I'll get there eventually.

**EDIT: This is updated constantly, submit guides as a new comment and if the information isn't redundant due to another guide it WILL get added. Also, feel free to ask me questions too, I have no problem with helping people out with anything**

This here is a compilation of things you NEED to read/watch, I'm sure more will get posted to the comments (please vote these to the top and not someone's complaint about a problem - whining - or some joke). This is going to be your one stop resource to catching up with those of use that are 150+ hours ahead of you.

I'm going to try to keep my list here in order of importance, what you need to understand FIRST. It starts with infantry basics and grows, sniping goes last (though I know there ARE useful snipers the majority of you are a burden to the team). I highly recommend not only reading the submissions linked here but much of the comments as well. Bear in mind that patches since various comments WILL have changed the balance, console users bear in mind that PC has patches the consoles don't have yet.

**NEW GUIDES** (after March/April 2012 patch)

This section is for new guides after recent patches, as such it doesn't follow the ""in order of importance"" concept this all aimed to follow originally, some guides below have outdated information as of recent changes which makes newer guides more valuable.

I'll be maintaining this, adding anything people submit for the foreseeable future of my BF3 playing. If the mods want to sidebar it they can rest assured it'll remain updated, keep submissions for the top post in entirely new comments so I get a notification please. Also, here's a shameless plug for my subreddit /r/gamernews.

I suspect I might also update the formatting a little as time goes on.

1323731358.0	na7t9	Higher level strategy discussion for BF3	granto	892	198	281	"EnixDark put up some great guides about weapons, so I was inspired to contribute with some discussion on higher level FPS strategy as it pertains to BF3. I have a background in competitive gaming at the national level and logged over 100 hours in BF3. While I won't claim to be an expert, I might know more than your average bear. 

Jumping right in, the number one reason people die is lack of situational awareness (SA). Without SA, you will play a FPS in a reactionary manner, which means someone shoots at you or comes on your screen suddenly, then you try to shoot back. In a game like BF3 that has a short time-to-kill and instant hit weapons (guns), playing a reactive style game is close to impossible. This is because the average human reaction time is close to 25ms, so when someone has a half second (500ms) initiative, you are at an extreme disadvantage. The only way to overcome the enemy initiative is relying on their lack of skill and/or your ability to process motor motions (aim) faster.

The common misconception is that elite players have lightning reflexes, but the reality is that most of them have average reaction times... but they acquire targets much faster. More than anything though, they have incredible SA, which is why a casual gamer watching competitive players often think they have some crazy ESP on how to predict the enemy movements. The key to becoming a better gamer as a whole, is increasing your SA so that in any encounter, you will have a better initiative, forcing your opponent to play a reactionary game.

With that covered, SA is based on six key points:

- Map knowledge (knowing the hot/safe zones)
- Radar (simply knowing enemy locations, incoming danger)
- **Flow** (movements, deaths, battle visuals/sounds from around you)
- Communication (player to player announcements)
- **Reaction state** (more on this later...)

Map knowledge is an often cited strategy, but the reasoning behind it is that it conditions you to where you should be aiming. Anyone that plays BF3 long enough will know all the general sniping spots, corners and hot zones. *You know the general direction to aim based on where the enemy comes from.*

Radar is what separates the casuals (negative KD) from the real gamers. If you can master radar and you are not incompetent at motor controls, you will be above the pack. I will readily admit to dying because I have been using my radar to aim as opposed to my screen. It should be that important to observe with one eye (or two) at all times. Not only should you be looking for the red triangles AND their orientation, you should be looking for skulls of your teammates dying and where. Too often I've flanked enemy squads with a suppressed gun and taken out the last two, reloaded, then finished off the rest. If people are dying around you, be highly alert. *You know where to aim because you see where they will be.*

This leads to **flow**, which is the introduction to higher level play that most of you either intuitively know or act on already. Flow is the tide of battle that includes zones controlled by allies/enemies, which side has the upper hand and action on routes leading to each. Essentially, a bird's eye perspective of what is happening on the map. Flow requires using the limited amount of information available (radar, onscreen) and attempting to understand which areas are hot and which areas are vulnerable. Literally, think of water pushing and pulling around the map and that is the idea of flow. Say on Metro, you hear two huge fights at the first escalator and side stairs, you'll know the second escalator will be the least watched. 

Casual players don't apply flow and can counted to stack with teammates to push a certain area. This means that flow is best applied toward flanking, because you can identify the routes of least resistance and make your way through to eventually hit the other team from behind. This is almost always high risk/high reward (another reason why casuals don't prefer this method), as the times you die will far outrank the times you succeed. However, when you do succeed, it will often be devastating for the enemy team and disrupt their position bad enough that your team can break through.  

I'm sure this is why the radio beacon is getting the nerf, because it's ridiculously powerful in the right hands due to the ability to inject yourself directly into flow. Enemy ""safe"" zones are now hot and you can force them to slow down, bunker down or abandon a position getting flanked. Without proper flow, things turn into chaos, where you don't know which way to look, what is secure and what not. Casual players HATE chaos and LIKE predictability, which is why they often stack with other players (especially at choke holds). Beacons add chaos to the order, so it really screws with casual players the most when it gets abused.

The MAV isn't a flow breaker per se, but given its ridiculous spotting effectiveness, it exponentially increases the SA for your ENTIRE TEAM. The balancing problem with a device like the MAV is that casual players stay the same, but good players get better with a MAV guy on the team.

The other best flow breaker in the game is the M320 smoke. I hardly ever see anyone use smoke except other high level players. The utility factor is twofold, as it hides team movement if you shoot it at hot zones or disorient enemy positions if you fire at them. The caveat is that smoke requires two things: self-sacrifice and the willingness for your team/squad to advance to take advantage of it. A squad with two smokers and two rushers with RPG/shotguns/C4 can deliver a massive effect to a ""locked down"" area. But, they all have to be willing to rush in and die for it to be effective, which are two things casuals don't understand/are unwilling to do.

What other flow breakers are there?  Transport vehicles. The team can spawn on transport vehicles, so keeping these alive and behind/above the enemy is a huge part of team efficiency. (Begin rant) A lot of people here say that transport choppers are a thankless task. Why yes, they are. But they help win games, which is what being part of a team is about. Who is the first guy rushing the MCOM with smoke that gets shot arming it but reveals the 2 guys crouched in the corner on radar?  Yeah, that's me, but fuck it, my squad now knows where they are and arm it for me. If I wanted personal glory, I'd go play 1v1 Starcraft or Quake again, but no, I'm playing BF3, so remind myself to man up from time to time, stop whining like a MW3 player worried about their K:D ratio and try to help my team win for a change. The only satisfaction you need is knowing that you are a moving spawn beacon dropping beautiful noobs with cannons into the enemy kool-aid pool. (/rant). 

Side note: One of the things BF3 hasn't had much credit is in the map design, because almost all BF3 maps are designed with great flow. Good map designers know how to build maps to design combat around certain areas, but almost always put vulnerabilities into each position (multiple entrances) to prevent outright lock on any one area. Or in a game type like Conquest, if one area is dead locked, you can simply take another point and move on.

I've coached players before on the notion of flow and have guided players around maps where they slaughter players simply from getting better positioning. You don't always have to flank, you can just recognize when the enemy flow is coming to you, wait just for the right moment and pop up your LMG and make the magic rainbows appear. The better you are at flow, the less often you get shot in the back and the more often you shoot someone else in the back. *With flow, you know where to aim not because you see them in front of you or on radar, but because you came to that conclusion logically.*

Now onto the second most important concept: **reaction state**. Unless you are trained in meditation, you cannot keep a heightened state of awareness for more than a certain duration. This applies to FPS games as well. When you round a corner KNOWING that a guy will be there, you will enter a certain state where you are ready to hit the trigger, your eyes are already pre-scanning and your reaction time is also sped up. On the opposite side, if you are waiting in a room on the defensive and don't know when the enemy is going to come, it is nearly impossible to keep a high state of awareness, as you can only hold it so long. This is why SA is critical, because it informs your body when to be ready and gives you the initiative in a fight. 

Not only that, the way that the network coding works in most modern games (especially faster games like MW), the attacker gets an advantage in terms of reaction time, because by the time your opponent sees you entering a room, you will already have been in the room looking at him. I won't go into full detail on the mechanics, but this is also why you die after rounding a corner, why you SWEAR you won an engagement only to have lost and kill guys who go out of your field of view.

1349378170.0	10y94p	Lock on weapons in BF3	LyraAndBonBon	815	163	140	"Stingers, and to a lesser degree heatseekers, seem to go back and forth between useless and overpowered with each patch. As lock on weapons they're very hard to balance. There's little skill involved to blur the line between too effective and not effective enough, so even the slightest imbalances are amplified. To make things worse stingers and heatseekers have to be balanced against vehicles ranging from slow scout helicopters, to speedy jets.

In my opinion, the biggest problem with heatseeking missiles at the moment is their ""one size fits all"" approach to balance. They have a set maximum range, and a set lock time that apply to all vehicles. This makes them near impossible to balance for every situation.

A solution would be to make lock time affected by other factors through a fundamental change to how these missiles function. Rather than a set range and lock time, both would be calculated through an equation something like this:

* lockscore += ( heat / distance ) - weapondecay

This equation would run in a loop many times a second. While aimed at a vehicle in range, the missile would gradually build up lockscore. Once lockscore reaches a certain value, the missile could be fired.

Three variables affect the rate at which a missile gains lock score, distance to target, the target's heat signature, and a weapon specific decay rate.

* Distance - The rate at which the launcher gains lockscore would be inversely proportional to distance, meaning the farther away the target, the longer it takes to lock on.

* Heat - Heat is a value specific to the target. Lock on speed is directly proportional to heat. The hotter the target, the faster and farther the missile can lock on. I'll get to more specific information about heat later.

* Weapondecay - This is a weapon specific value defining the amount of lockscore lost with each cycle. This number defines the relative range and lock speed of a missile. Lower values mean longer range and faster lock time, while higher numbers limit range and result in longer lock times. Jet and AA missiles would have low decay, and therefore long range, while stingers would have slightly higher decay and consequently shorter range. Equipping Beam Scanning in a jet would lower weapon decay, resulting in heatseekers with a very long effective range, with a very fast lock time against closer targets.

Now, about heat. Each aircraft type would have a baseline heat value defining its susceptibility to lock on weapons. Slower, more vulnerable vehicles would tend to have lower heat, while faster and more dangerous ones would have higher heat. Finding the right values would take testing, but the progression from coolest to hottest should go as follows.

**Scout Heli &lt;&lt; Transport Heli &lt;&lt; Attack Heli &lt;&lt; Gunship &lt;&lt; Jets**

This allows slow scout helicopters to get close enough to be effective, while still allowing missiles to reach out and touch jets.

Other factors would come into play as well. For instance the upgrade ""Stealth."" Rather than increasing lock time, stealth would provide a slight decrease to heat, leading to longer lock times, and shorter effective range.

Besides its normal effect of preventing locks from heatseekers, Below Radar would also play a part in determining heat, allowing it to be a partial counter to stingers. While flying lower than 25m, heat would be reduced by an amount inversely proportional to your altitude. Essentially below radar would be a stronger version of the new stealth while active, increasing lock time, and reducing range. This allows a heli a few hundred meters away to escape a stinger by dropping low, but allows the stinger to remain effective against nearby helicopters.

Finally using afterburners would increase a jet's heat. This would make it harder for a jet to speed out of range by hitting afterburners, as they would cause missiles to lock on a bit faster and reach farther.

---

Other restrictions would need to be added to make the system work, such as an absolute min and max lock time, and finding the right heat and weapondecay values would take a lot of testing, but I believe a system like this is the best chance we have of seeing balanced stingers and heatseekers in BF3.

One size fits all ranges and lock times simply don't work. The system needs flexibility to allow missiles to function correctly against the different types of vehicles on a wide variety of maps.

1344943273.0	y74gm	For the interested: G3 from a real life experience perspective.	nOcsy	800	160	215	"Hey guys.

I know it's not the most popular weapon of choice in Battlefield 3, but there are some of you who use it and therefore I thought it could be fun with some ""nice to know"" information about this rifle from someone who's used it in actual service.

A little backstory: The Norwegian Armed Forces used the AG3 (our version of the G3A3) as the standard assault rifle up until 2007, which was when the HK416 was ordered (M416). Norwegian Forces are very involved in international military operations, and that's where the ""actual service"" part kicks in. Apart from peacetime training I used this rifle in Kosovo 2004, more specifically KFOR 8 in the QRF (Quick Reaction Force).

Now, on to the rifle! The first thing that comes to mind when I think back to this weapon is weight and size. Over 5kg (11 lbs) with ammunition, and when you add double mags and a 40mm this thing will put muscles on your arms like a gym. It's also over 1 meter long. Now, although there was a lot of hate involved in hauling this beast around, once you get into an open firing situation there are few things you'd rather have on your side and it's almost like you want to apologize to the rifle for cursing its weight. With the 7.62mm rounds this thing will eat through a centimeter of armored steel, so unless your enemy had proper cover you could pretty much just fire in their general direction. You're either going to hit them through whatever they are hiding behind, or suppress them significantly (We also used the MG3 for suppression, that's ~~900~~ 1200 RoF with 7.62mm); obviously the return fire was next to non-existent. I remember during a NATO winter exercise in northern Norway, we swapped rifles on the shooting range with some American marines, and after we were done testing eachothers guns out, they renamed the AG3 to ""The Hand Cannon"". There was one situation a little later in Pristina where the stopping power of the G3 prevented a lot of havoc, so in some cases the trade-off for punch is worth the hauling.

Due to this, the weight and size was not always directly negative; it could also be positive. There are a few more reasons for this: 1. Accuracy. In single shot mode, as in the game, it is very accurate mostly due to its inertia and long barrel. In fact we've used [zoom optics on the G3 with great success](http://i.imgur.com/43rkc.jpg). 2. Firepower - As we said, a bigger gun and a larger caliber will provide more punch. Lastly, 3. Something we noticed on regular city patrols is that it is quite intimidating. It's not a big point to address, but the moral behind a lot of military tactics is the perception of authority and intimidation. I can address this further if anyone is curious.

Ok, wall of text aside. Let's look at some of the directly positive or negative aspects, or problems with this rifle. (As we discussed, the weight/size wasn't inherently negative). 

Something that's not part of BF3 is weapon jamming, be it due to mud, snow or just soot from repeated fire. The G3 jams very rarely, and this is a big deal breaker in a lot of situations! This gun will probably fire regardless of what you've dragged it through. Also, the durability is very good. It's hard to break something on the G3 and assembly/disassembly is simple and fast. I have little experience with the standard stock as we used a retractable steel stock (To suit the space requirements of being in armored vehicles), but the few times I tried it, it seemed fine. The iron sights are also excellent.

However, even though I have a lot of praise for this rifle, it has it's drawbacks:

In close quarters for instance, it's a nightmare. It's too long to use effectively indoors, or even in urban combat, and in this case the weight will slow you down considerably. (which is funny, because in BF3 CQ it's quite good!) 

There's also the case of recoil. Now, for those of you who's tried it in the game you know it has a high amount of it, but compared to real life, it's scaled down pretty good. This rifle kicks you like a mule. I mean, I've had a blue shoulder from this thing, and if you don't know how to aim properly with the iron sights, it's going to kick you right in the eye. This makes the full auto setting useless. There is more or less no situation where you want to spray this rifle. MAYBE if you're cleaning up a foxhole, but even then I'm sure it's more effective to use single-fire. 

Mag size. It only holds 20 rounds, plus one the chamber. We solved this by [taping mags together in pairs](http://i.imgur.com/XTmqB.jpg), making a switch take less than a second. It worked quite well, but it added even more weight to an already heavy weapon, and it changes the center of gravity of the gun slightly, so it took a little getting used to. We also put tracer ammunition in the bottom 3 rounds of every magazine whenever we had a real operation, so that if you lost count of how many bullets you had left in the mag, you knew you should switch when you saw the gun fire tracers. This saved you from a full reload.

All in all, it's a good and reliable battle rifle and I really liked the G3, apart from it's shortcomings in certain situations. In open field warfare, I still think it's one of the best rifles ever made.

Nearing the end now (I promise!). I'd like to discuss some of the differences from real life G3 to BF3 G3. I've read a lot about how people don't like the sound of it -- Although I don't know specifically why they don't like it, I can confirm that it's a little off, but not that much. The only difference is that the game sound is higher pitched than the real life G3. It's supposed to sound deeper. Here's some [audio from the BF3 G3](http://youtu.be/oVpXpHcRj8M), and here's some [audio from the Norwegian AG3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr14_2Z2m0A). They got the rate of fire correct though. It's around 550 RoF.

Also, there's the case of not being able to attach a grenade launcher to this rifle in game. The M320 will not the fit the G3, but I've used a 40MM grenade launcher on mine pretty much since I got it; [The HK79](http://i.imgur.com/ZB7Sh.jpg). I'm not sure why this is not available in the game, because it would be easy to add it, but I think there might be a copyright barrier with Heckler &amp; Koch, as a lot of their guns are called the M*, but in the weapons description they are referred to as being produced by ""A famous German weapons manufacturer"". It kinda sucks, because a HK79 attachment would complete my nostalgia in the game, even though it's not that popular to get hit with.

Anyways, that's a digest of the G3 in real life - Hope you enjoyed it! And if you want to try out this rifle in the game, I recommend quick optic sights, RDS, or holo, with just a heavy barrel. It really performs well in all situations and ranges once you get used to it.

I sit in my throne of steel pounding away at the enemies' encampments while you faithfully, patiently, await our next move. You don't fire off rounds at ghosts and always spot the enemies.

* Some game sounds go away randomly and then come back. [Examples](http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield3/comments/z110v/i_might_be_on_to_something_with_the_sound_glitch/)
* On Close Quarters maps you hear footsteps/shots/shoutings from over and under you as if they were on the same level.
* SOFLAM hitbox needs to be fixed especially when on an incline
* TUGS hitbox is placed too low and causes bullets to miss when aimed at the top half
* The Conquest Domination Flags' Hitboxes are broken http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoaMbeS9GY8
* If you hold down the defibrillator the animation gets stuck with arms out.
* The repair tool plays the igniting sound when pulled out but doesn't appear lit until you start to use it.
* Fix the Knifing dead zone on players using the Mortar http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBSxvR02YpM#t=5m33s
* When ""Laser Painter"" is equipped Ammo counters are not shown in choppers
* TV missile/Tank Shells randomly don't do damage on impact to vehicles. (15-20% of the time)
* TV missile randomly can cause the chopper to lose control and crash
* If menu is displayed while waiting to respawn and are revived the menu remains displayed. (Can be fixed by pausing and unpausing.)
* The M320 buck delayed shooting about half a second between triggering and firing.  Flash animation appears to be firing from primary muzzle position.
* When you equip the M26 Slug to the AUG, it hits significantly higher than where you're aiming http://i.imgur.com/hfHmC.jpg
* Now you can't even equip the M320 smoke to the AUG at all.
* Tanks slide around on inclines uncontrollably (Never had this problem with BC2)
* Vehicle Collisions whether with friendly or enemy are very glitchy and cause rubberbanding.
* Enemies vaulting over obstacles perform the climbing animation, then suddenly teleport 10 feet ahead.
* When spawning after changing your loadout your weapon will not be visible and you cannot shoot for a few seconds.
* M320 Smoke can still be spotted through and does not remove spotted objects within its radius. (It *IS* possible because it was done in BC2)
* Claymores and C4 all disappear on death but should instead stay until the player respawns so that they remain when you are revived.
* Deployed recon equipment is only destroyed once the recon respawns, not upon death like the equipment from the support class. Sometimes, the equipment is destroyed long after (~0.5 - 1 seconds-ish) after the spawn. If the recon reflexively switches to the radio beacon (or MAV/TUGS/SOFLAM) immediately after spawning the game destroys the item that is in the recon's hands (as well as the one already placed), leaving them without a beacon to set.
* Air Radar doesn't display friendly vehicles.
* Mobile AA still does damage to the AMTRAC, even though it no longer damages other armored vehicles.
* Stationary launchers make a firing sound when entered but don't shoot anything.
* Stationary launchers consistently make reload sounds when not occupied.
* Teammates can indefinitely delay the respawn of vehicles by placing Friendly Vehicles or Equipment where the vehicle will spawn.
* Vaulting through Windows is very glitchy and most of the time won't work.
* SOFLAM will lock on friendlies when initially deployed but not manned resulting in enemy being able to take advantage of this.
* You are not able to spawn on your own spawn beacons unless you are in a squad.
* Your soldier will call out ""enemy spotted"" if you spot a recently killed enemy soldier.
* When you have the AN-94 equipped and you switch to your secondary and back to the AN-94 without firing your sidearm, half of the barrel disappears. http://i.imgur.com/VpuPt.jpg
* The MP412-REX has a texture bug where the ammo cylinder and/or ammo disappears. http://i.imgur.com/AfSjr.jpg
* Almost every time I use the mortar there is no shell in the hand I am dropping shells into the mortar with (ie. invisible mortar shells).
* When joining a game with a squad of friends they get put on different teams or squads.
* ACW-R not causing controller rumble on consoles
* Teammates appear as enemies with the MAV http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MopXYYiL-aw
* SOFLAM locks on to closer objects rather than those at the center of aiming reticle

* Sometimes the gunner dot crosshair doesn't show in transport heli
* Sometimes the 'repair circle' does not show when repairing vehicles
* Sometimes the javelin the target box doesn't appear even when receiving acquire 
and lock tones.
* Sometimes when killed in the mortar my soldier stays in the mortar looking out with the mortar map up. Can only be fixed by pausing and quitting the match. (Suicide won't work)
* Newly spawned tanks will sometimes not have any vehicle upgrades available
* Sometimes when exiting a vehicle your soldier's gun makes a firing sound but doesn't actually shoot.
* Sometimes when reloading no animation occurs even though sound plays and the reload counter updates.
* Sometimes shotguns get stuck in reload loop without actually reloading http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H6xy0SrlJI (campaign video, but always happens in multiplayer)
* Sometimes, upon being revived, a player has his primary out and all weapons reloaded. It acts almost like a respawn. (Been happening with the most recent patch)
* In vehicles with Zoom Optics when switching between zooms (or guided missiles in jets) the animation keeps a super zoomed in view but gains the turn speed of an unzoomed view. Alternatively tank gunners when in an unzoomed view the HUD will appear shrunken to 50% in the middle of the screen.
* There is a little artifact in the bottom of the screen in the form of a line of ""static"" often (Also unknown cause). Appears centered about an inch from the bottom and never gets close to the sides of the screen.
* Sometimes medals/ribbons stay displayed until you die reducing your field of vision on PC.
* Sometimes the music leading to the last ticket plays continuously through the round review.
* Sometimes when climbing ladders you cannot turn your soldiers head to look around.

***Assault:***

**AK-74M:** Russian starter weapon - This is the first weapon for the Russian side, and while it shoots bullets and kills people, it's average, and not even a good kind of average. If you want a good all-around rifle, look at the next three options.  

**M416:** Better than junk? - Beats the AK-74M in every discernable way, faster firerate, faster reload, lower recoil. Notable for having a good first shot recoil, so your follow up shots will be pretty accurate.  
However, if you're willing to take a very small sacrifice in that regard, you should try the...

**M16A3/A4:** Best(?) all-around rifle - (The M16A3 is the American starting weapon, the M16A4 is an unlockable. They are functionally the same weapon, they even share unlocks and service stars. They difference is the A3 has full-auto fire, while the A4 has a three-round burst instead.) While this has a little higher first shot recoil than the M416, the M16 boasts a higher firerate, higher bullet velocity, fastest Assault reload speed, and lower sustained vertical recoil. The only weakness is that you have to fully rank up the Assault class to unlock the A3 version for the Russian forces. With the right attachments (and there are no wrong ones), this rifle can be set up to be effective in any situation. Note: If using the red dot or holo sights, you can see your ironsight in the bottom of your view. It's nagging at best, and blocking enemies at worst.

**AEK-971:** All-around alternative, high damage - At 900 RPM, is one of the fastest firers and damage dealers in the game (that is, until Back to Karkand.) Considering it has one of the best vertical recoils of any Assault rifle, the AEK-971 is great at close to mid-range, and is usable in very short bursts at long-range if the need arises. It has three significant disadvantages when compared to the M16: One, it has a lower bullet velocity, making it not as good at range. Two, it has a reload time that's almost an entire second longer, and the reload from empty is another second on top of that. Three, it has really high horizontal recoil, so a foregrip is suggested to tame this thing.
However, if you want to focus on long range, you have a few choice selections...

**KH2002:** All around great, excels at range - I'll get it off my chest now and say this is my absolute favorite Assault rifle, and one of my most favorite weapons in the game, even though I usually dislike weapons with a burst-fire mode in place of full-auto. Reason being, the vertical recoil is so incredibly low, the three-round burst can be used to pick off targets at range or just spammed at close range without a problem. It also has a good firerate, good bullet velocity, and uh, the worst reload speed outside of the Support LMGs. There's also this weird issue where since the rifle technically holds 31 rounds, the last bullet won't be part of a burst, and will take longer if you reload from empty, so be really careful about that, reload as often as you can (This goes for basically every weapon in the game). I'd suggest a heavy barrel/suppressor if the intention is to kill at long ranges. The horizontal recoil is high, but nothing a foregrip/bipod doesn't fix. 

**G3A3:** Long range, high damage - The final CO-OP unlock, it is well earned for grinding those missions. While it has the lowest RPM of the Assault rifles, it does more damage per shot (5 at close range, 3 at far), balancing the damage per second out to comparable levels, and favoring those who prefer single-shot or short bursts (this also make it able to one-hit headshot kill players at close range on hardcore). This rifle also has a smaller initial spread WHILE NOT MOVING, but a higher spread increase per shot when compared to any other Assault rifle, making single shots much better than full-auto. Recoil is also high, so don't expect to burst-fire past mid-range. Firing from the hip or while moving has a higher spread than normal, so be careful in close range engagements. The bipod for this weapon reduces vertical recoil more than for other Assault rifles, making it possible the best Assault choice for the bipod. The bullet velocity is lower than the other Assault rifles, meaning you have to practice leading your targets more, and accounting for bullet drop. Oh, and it has a 20 round magazine instead of the standard 30, make your shots count. (Make sure to read the special note after the next weapon's description.)

**AN-94:** Long range, two bullets for the accuracy of one! OR, close-range headshots - There's two really special things about this rifle, one more apparent than the other. One, it has a two-round burst feature. Two, unlike every other's weapon first shot recoil multiplier being 1 or greater, the AN-94's is .67, making its first shot's recoil about equal to other rifles' sustained recoil. However the sustained recoil is pretty bad, so be careful about long bursts. Otherwise, it's a lot like the AEK-971, just with much lower RPM. If you aren't using the two-shot burst on this rifle, you probably shouldn't be using it. Note that there's sometimes a bug where firing the burst rapidly will ""jam"" the gun, we'll have to see if this gets worked out in a patch. (Read the following special note.)

*Special note:* Heavy Barrel for the G3A3 + AN-94 - What makes these two weapons exceptionally good for long range, in addition to the above, is that they are treated differently when used with the heavy barrel. Normally, the heavy barrel reduces half the initial spread when aiming down the sight, but for these two rifles, it removes %100 OF THE SPREAD for the first shot. Even while moving and aiming, the heavy barrel provides pixel-perfect accuracy, something no other weapon in the game achieves while on the move. With a little luck concerning the spread, the AN-94's second bullet can land exactly where the first did, an instant kill double-headshot at very close range.  
Speaking of close-range...

**F2000:** Run 'n' Gun - This rifle's first shot recoil is absolutely horrible, and the minimum spread while aiming and not moving is higher than any other rifle, so why should you ever use this? Well, It's minimum spread while moving and/or firing from the hip is lower than any other rifle. You are able to fire three to five bullets before your spread gets to a point equal to the other rifles' initial spreads in the same situation. I'd use a suppressor to help control the recoil if you plan to mainly aim and firing while moving. If you plan to fill people full of holes without aiming at all, I'd go with a laser sight to keep it as accurate as possible. The horizontal recoil is almost as bad as the vertical, a foregrip is highly suggested. Bipod + Laser would make for a ridiculously strange combination that just might be awesome. The F2000 has a high firerate, but a high reload time, so either get good with your sidearm, or good at clearing out squads in one magazine.

****

***Assault, Back To Karkand:***

**FAMAS:** Extremely high damage at extremely close range - If you haven't heard, the FAMAS has a 1000 RPM firerate, the highest in the game. However, it also has the worst reload time of any Assault rifle, the worst horizontal recoil, a mediocre vertical recoil, a higher initial spread when aiming down the sights, and a slower decrease of recoil over time (changing this value is kind of the ""theme"" of weapons in BtK). On the one hand, I'll be surprised to see all these downsides make up for a higher RPM, but on the other, in close range where spread and recoil don't matter, the FAMAS should be able to destroy anyone using anything except maybe a shotgun. We'll have to see how it plays out.

**L85A2:** Short/Mid-range tactical rifle? - So this rifle has a reload speed, a horizontal recoil, and an aimed while unmoving minimum spread all almost as bad as that FAMAS, and it's RPM is a third less. So what redeems this rifle? One, like the F2000, it has a lower minimum spread while firing from the hip and/or moving. Two, it has a very respectable verticle recoil. Three, and what may be the important part, is that the effects of recoil reduce per second faster than any other Assault rifle. My interpretation of this data is that the L85A2 is meant to by used as a series of quick three-shot bursts at mid-range, where your recoil recovers to an acceptable level faster than in does for others. Up close, it's probably best to fire from the hip, as your RPM is too low for you to have time to really aim, and you have a spread advantage against anyone else trying to do the same.

This wouldn't be a problem if it was just a forum ban, because after all - their forums, their rules... but EA also bans you from accessing and being able to play the games you paid for.

This is a stupid policy not only because it is unfair but because the game has more foul language than almost any other I've played.

Stop using their forums, if this is how they are going to police them(without even a warning, but instead an immediate ban), they don't deserve the traffic, or the community.

Several good/active forums can be found by just googling ""battlefield 3 forum"" so you can find some that are not run like police states.

Some stupidity I've seen upvoted Sky high: 


- *MoH Costs $70.* No, MoH costs $60. $70 is a deluxe digital version, which includes some early unlocks and did include the BF4 beta access (it's gone now). 

- *BC2 was a better game than BF3.* So stop playing BF3? Jesus Christ.

- *Oh my god, milking the franchise Bf2, etc.* Are you jokers kidding me? Why the hell would DICE/EA care about you people? The game sold a total of 2.2 mil in it's lifetime: 
&gt; Total sales by July 2006 were 2,225,000 
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefield_2).

Whereas Battlefield 3 has sold, what, 10 million? Can we get our heads out of asses for just one second? 


Is there any place I can go to talk about the good in games in general and not fucking talk about how shit it is? Jesus Christ. I visited /r/bf3 religiously, now it's just filled with the most whiny cunts that shouldn't even be subbed here.


You love it so much that all you'd like to do is bitch about it. Is there a single thread where you all not get your panties in a fucking knot because ""EA, PREMIUM, ETC"" Don't we already have that at /r/gaming? Fuck. 


Alright, Downvote away now. Maybe your nostalgia tears will stop the next Battlefield from selling millions again. 


**Edit**: I've got a lot of time in BC2. A lot. It's not a better game, BC2 was a separate TYPE of game.  


**Second Edit:** Okay I was kinda drunk and very unhappy about all the comments posted on every single front page link I saw. This is a great community that puts out some amazing videos and talks, but this whole subreddit has become a negative nancy. The entire internet has. I saw BF4 and I was stoked, I love BF3, and I've pretty much played the hell out of it. Went to /r/battlefield3 this morning to read comments and not a single comment complaining about how **it might be**. Nothing. All I got was *IT BETTER BE 2142, IT BETTER BE BC3*. "	t5_2rlua	True

I gave it some more thought, and I think that'd be a pretty neat feature for jets. You'd only be able to turn at high g-forces for a few seconds before your vision starts fading and controls aren't as responsive, just like in real life. Obviously, you'd be able to recover after a few seconds.

This would do a couple things:  
1. End circlejerk dogfighting and force pilots to use new evasive maneuvers  
2. Make gun runs more deliberate, as turning sharply to avoid missiles would result in blacking out.

Of course, this isn't going to be implemented, but it's fun to entertain thoughts like these.

What do you guys think?

BF3 is a great game. 	sneek_	966	383	343	"Increasingly since that false Twitter post saying to expect a BF3 update was raped by everyone, I have watched both this subreddit and the Bf3 forums become absolutely dominated by people bashing this game and the developers.  I understand that we're all excited to see what DICE has in store for us but it's beginning to shun me away from discussion boards just because I find all the raging annoying.  

There are bugs that need attention in this game - but if you know about them, I bet DICE does too.  No need to dominate this game's public image.  Mostly I feel this way because I want to see BF3 do well.  I love the game and want my friends and coworkers to buy it and play it with me.  Right now they are all playing MW3.

I play BF3 as much as I can (busy life) but guess what?  I don't feel the need to piss all over the BF3 community when I get killed by frag rounds.  I don't search for a baby to choke when I can't read the minimap.  BF3 crashes for me maybe once a week which is annoying.  I do get annoyed by the fact that I can't communicate properly with my squad, but I understand the fact that they are working on changes.  I can wait patiently.

1341782133.0	w8iw9	Based on community demand, I'm starting a vanilla, 64p CQ, all-maps PC server.  And HIRING a server manager -- yes, paid.  Want applicants and feedback!	jhogan	732	157	221	"I too have been frustrated at the lack of good options for vanilla PC servers with a wide map rotation.  Judging from [recent](http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield3/comments/w7zgd/all_i_want_to_do_is_play_vanilla_b2k_maps_with/) [discussions](http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield3/comments/w6guu/call_for_diceea_servers_on_pc/) in this subreddit, there's a lot of you that feel the same way.  So I'm going to try to fix it.

The most important thing with any server is that it provide a quality gaming experience for its players.  So we'll have an active roster of mature admins (actively managed to cull out any bad seeds that creep in), good team balance plug-ins, a teamspeak server w/the teamspeak sync plug-in (same as Lizard Lounge uses!), etc.

Since the hardest part of getting a new server going is actually attracting a critical mass of players, I have some unconventional promotional ideas.  For example: Daily or weekly cash prizes (modest but non-trivial -- $20? $50?) for server participation in the early days, as measured by largest # of non-idle hours logged on the server (assuming we can find a plugin to measure this?)  Or some fun events (knife fights? pistol fights?) which we organize &amp; promote here in the reddit community.


All that said, I need some help from y'all!

* I have more money than time, so I am looking to HIRE a server manager.  I will pay someone USD $10/hr to manage all technical stuff (installing plugins, managing teamspeak server, etc.), promotional programs, maybe recruiting &amp; managing volunteer admins, and whatever else is needed.  It's modest pay, but damn cool work!  If you are interested, [PM me your *e-mail address* (not reddit username) here](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=jhogan&amp;subject=Server) and I'll respond off-reddit with details on an application process.  Feel free to propose a higher rate.

* Feedback!  What else would you like to see on your ideal server?  (Assume that ""vanilla game settings"" and ""full map rotation"" are non-negotiable) :-)  And how can we build a strong BF3/reddit community on the server?

* EDIT:  We will need some volunteer admins as well!  i.e. people who can hang out playing on the server, and kick hackers and troublemakers and such.  Friendly, responsible, non-power-trippy types, please [PM me your *e-mail address* (not reddit username) here](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=jhogan&amp;subject=Admin) if you'd like to be notified when opportunities are available.

I would love to have this server up and running within a week, maybe quicker if there is strong support.


EDIT: Probably clear from context, but ""CQ"" in the headline refers to Conquest, not Close Quarters.  Mentioning this here since it doesn't look like I can edit the headline.

EDIT 2:  Given that ""CQ"" means ""Conquest"", ""all maps"" means vanilla+B2k maps -- NOT close quarters.  

EDIT 3: OK, top of the bf3 frontpage, and like 10 people interested in the server manager gig so far.  **This is going to happen!**  Please keep the feedback coming, and continue to let me know if you are interested in the server manager or volunteer admin positions.  Thanks to all of you for your encouragement and support.

EDIT 4: I've tempered my enthusiasm with a bit of project planning, and realistically it will probably take 2-3 weeks to get the server up and running (recruiting managers &amp; admins takes a bit of time!)  I will try for 2.  :-)

Possibly even the ability to go into said city's sewer which is even more dark.

This leaves immense possibilities which would actually make flash suppressors, silencers, flashlights, and infrared scopes useful.  Also maybe the ability to toggle vehicles headlights on and off and maybe a search light for a helicopter.

changes "	2wheels	723	161	672	"Firstly, Thanks to Crash and Demise etc for listening to our bitching, this patch has totally been worth the wait!
 
1. Moved AA on Kharg (US on Carrier, Russian at Air strip) (Thanks whoever did this!!)
1. Faster vehicle spawn (I mainly noticed air) 
1. Shorter game start countdown
1. Much better responsiveness (Even better with AA turned off)
1. You can fly through all poles from testing with jets and little bird so far. (EDIT Only the top breaks, halfway down its still solid, which works out ok)
1. Can spawn into AA guns (People actually use them now)
1. **Improved sound EDIT: Can hear footsteps, reloading as well as voiceovers ( ahh fuck theres a grenade etc), much more clearly, I could hear footsteps and reloading from next room.
1. I think console sound cutout is fixed (EDIT: Reports that it isnt)
1. Uninstalls B2K and forces you to re download (PS3 thing I think)
1. Custom Servers (AU Pricing, 34.99 for 30 days, 9X.XX for 90 days, also has 1 day option and some others)
1. Match Making option in multi player, seems to be for esport/organised scrims on custom servers.
1. Reset some of my kit customisations
1. Many Many small UI tweaks, minimap has more focus on team function icons (heal, repair, flags)
1.     Icons for vehicles on spawn screen
1.     Easier to see what spawn point is selected on map when selecting spawn
1.     No blind colour mode, but all the icons seem to be much easier to see (seem to be tweaked towards blind mode type icons)
1. Jets guided missiles are actually useful and can take out a tank and nearby infantry (runners from tank) in 2-3 hits tops)
1. *Stinger takes about 2-3 seconds to lock onto and fire, missiles seem to move slightly faster, 1 hit disable and if more then 1 engineer in area heli is generally fucked, I forsee a lot of heli's flying with ECM or Maintenance in future, range is greatly reduced but enough to keep helis off a flag and nearby area. EDIT: Lock on is UBER Fast, like seriously must be less then 2 seconds, Below radar has been buffed, I forgot about rpg's though and got 1 hitted.
1. Can quit between rounds
1. Havoc is noticeably easier to fly but I still don't think its on par with Cobra, should be able to stand its own though.
1. **Other squad leader objectives are marked on flags, I could see this as SL, it shows a star next to objective X1 or X2 if 2 SL have marked it**, this is awesome!
1. Laser marker or maybe guided missile range seems to have been increased, could hit empty APC at C from Aircraft carrier on Canals using little bird.

1. Dno if its me but there seem to be slight camera and animation changes, Heli's and jets seem to explode and break up a lot more smoothly.
1. (LatrellSwisher) Additional Dogtags have been added (A-91 and M26 dog tags. As well as a tag for the game 'Syndicate') 
1. Slight graphic tweaks, more saturation, less blue and easier to see icons
1. All air vehicles now start with flares as a minimum 
1. No minimum player count, you can move around right away, points only count after 8 players join though
1. Red Laser designator can be seen from tanks and heli's as well as SOFLAM's now. 
1. Added ladder to Sharqi tv tower (Keep eye out for other map tweaks)
1. Separate customisations for US and RU now, so it doesn't switch your guns around every round. 
1. Numerous changes to ribbons and medal requirements (see comments below)
1. Driver Kill assist increased, Laser designation possibly (need to confirm)
1. Added a littlebird to attackers on rush for sharqi
1. Tank added earlier to bazaar rush for attackers
1. Lot more recoil added to most guns
1. Greater suppressive effect, suppressed accuracy in particular
1. Jet guns do less damage so dogfights are a bit more interesting now
1. ECM might be buffed, you can see your own ECM chaffs now (hovering in place while firing ecm will cover you in smoke completely.
1. Damavand Peak Rush. Attackers get 2 Jeeps instead of previous one
1. (mental_disorders) Additional Attachments/Unlocks: M27 IAR + QBB-95 + SKS has a Heavy Barrel MG36 + AS-VAL has extended mags 
1. Last 2 squads have been hidden (Squad menu cleaned up as well)  so only 4 squads available, this not only encourages pubbers to squad up, but when you join as a squad it will unlock a hidden squad for you so you aren't split up. (Smart approach)
1. Can invite people to squads
1. Higher ticket servers and other server variations (custom servers and official)
1. (the-knife) Battlelog now (with the new browser update) automatically updates the ""Upcoming Unlocks"" list when a new battle report arrives.

1319653571.0	lpyw8	I just want to take a quick moment to recognize Stefan Strandberg - Sound design lead for Battlefield 3	Sc00ter5	807	244	138	"I was reading the ""[My first real Battefield moment!](http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield3/comments/lpo10/my_first_real_battefield_moment/)"" thread and a lot of people talk about being pinned down by gun fire in Battlefield 3.  I've got to hand it to the team at DICE.  When an enemy is shooting at you your screen blurs and vignettes slightly, but the sound... my god the sound.  Hearing the bullets ping off the walls all around you or the rock you are crouched behind really makes you **not** want to pop your head out and shoot back.  No other game has done this to me.  I often find myself either relying on a squad member to come bail me out, or I try to get the hell out of there.  It makes the feeling of a shoot out really intense.  The individual sounds are all great, especially the gun fire, but the way they work together is simply fantastic.  I just wanted to take a brief second to recognize Stefan Strandberg and his team for a job fantastically well done.

1339491933.0	uxoqm	Tentative future update Balance changes and Fixes	Demize99	731	175	982	"Here is a list of potential fixes for a future update. I've been scouring the feedback from Battlelog, Symthic, Reddit, Twitter and other places.  As usual, this is not exhaustive, nor is this a guarantee we will perform these changes.  Instead this is a request for feedback from our community.  Currently I cannot see any substantial reason to make balance changes the weapons added in Close Quarters.  The only weapon that has received substantial OP/UP feedback is the M417, which I feel is working exactly as it is intended: a good mid range run and gun weapon which lacks the long range accuracy of the MK11/SVD and has worse mobility than the SKS.  

Additionally, the discussion about aim assist changes has been interesting, though I find that players are mostly commenting on should aim assist be allowed or not. Players have suggested zoom spamming over powers aim assist after the update, however the update only changed how a the assist helps a player stay on a moving target not how aim assist works when zooming. Further more the videos players have shown attempting to show zoom spamming as a valid tactic fail to actually get the crosshairs on target, as the system is designed to only assist the player and the player will need to do the rest.  In fact the videos demonstrate a system which accomplishes exactly what it is designed to do.  Finally, some players have worried about quick scope snipers using zoom spamming, however high zoom scopes on all weapons prevent this tactic by not including any zoom assist, the player has to do this skill shot on all his own. I recognize this is a hot topic for highly skilled players, and I feel currently the new aim assist settings provide enough assistance to players without eliminating the skill element.


On to the Changes:

* A number of weapons have had their reload timers adjusted to better fit their animations and gameplay balance. For most of these weapons the gameplay timers were slightly out of sync with the actual reload animation, meaning the player could either fire before the animation was done, or had to wait longer than the animation played. Primarily this is a cosmetic change (around 0.1sec); however for a few weapons (M416, F2000, FAMAS, KH2002, MK3A1, JNG90, MG36 QBU-88, SVD, Pecheneg, SCAR-H, AN-94) this should also improve the performance of the weapon.
* Short and Long reload reduced: SCAR-L, AEK-971, F2000, AN-94, AK-74, PP2000, G3A3, SKS, MG36, JNG-90, MK3A1, SCAR-H, SVD, QBZ-95B
* Long reload reduced: AUG A3, 44 Magnum, KH2002, Pecheneg, L85A2, QBB-95, M1911, MP7, M4A1
* Short reload reduced: FAMAS, M39 EBR, M416, PP-19, QBU-88;
* Short and long reload increased: ASVal
* Long reload increased: P90


* Belt Fed Machine guns are now more accurate when standing and firing while aiming: M240, M249, Type88, and Pecheneg
* Increased the close range damage of the UMP but reduced its damage over range. The UMP now has a sweet spot in CQB but suffers compared to the PP2000 at longer ranges.
* Increased the long range damage of the PP2000 to highlight its role as a mid-range, low recoil PDW.
* Increased the min damage of the M1911 to make it fit better between the Magnums and the M9/MP443
* Reduced the M93R's damage and range, as it was an obvious goto pistol compared to the M9/MP443. Its recoil has been reduced for a smoother burst action to counter the reduced damage.
* Increased the fire rate and reload time of the MP412 REX to better highlight the improved CQB performance over the 44 Magnum.
* SG553: Horizontal recoil reduced to help make this weapon more controllable.
* MG36: Vertical recoil reduced to make this weapon more controllable.
* M416: Vertical, Horizontal, and First Shot recoil have all be reduced to make this weapon clearly different from the M16A3.
* 44 Magnum: Rate of fire reduced slightly to highlight this sidearm's role as a slow firing heavy hitter and differentiate it from the MP412 REX.
* M16A3: Recoil amounts slightly increased.
* M4A1: Recoil amounts slightly increased.
* G36: Vertical and First Shot recoil amounts reduced.
* The bonuses provided by a number of bipods have been increased: F2000, G3A3, M27, M416, Pecheneg, Type88, FAMAS, MG36
* Added Burst Fire to the M5K as an available option.
* Slightly reduced the range bonus added by the heavy barrel on the 5.56mm, 5.45mm, 6.5mm Assault Rifles.
* Slightly reduced the range penalty for the suppressor on 5.56mm, 5.45mm, and 6.5mm weapons: AR, Carbine, and LMG.
* Slightly reduced the range penalty for the suppressor on the SCAR-H.
* The radius for maximum damage of the 40mm LVG has been slightly increased. The overall damage level and range remain the same.
* Fixed the SCAR-L heavy barrel not increasing recoil when zoomed and standing.
* Fixed Jets not getting bonuses on Laser Designated targets.
* Fixed the AUG’s M320 smoke having an incorrectly high projectile velocity.


* Fixed helicopter weapons being unable to destroy equipment with splash damage.
* Increased the damage helicopter and jet rockets do to helicopters and jets and infantry.
* Increased the damage helicopter gunners and IFVs do to helicopters and jets.
* Slightly increased the damage of the AA vs infantry, AA is significantly less effective than even the coaxial LMG on tanks, making it extremely vulnerable.  AA should be effective against a single infantryman but not over powering.

EA/Dice just made me a peasant. Here are the facts: I made a snotty post on the battlelog forum on Aug. 28 complaining about DICE developer JBRipley's response to the recent Premium assignment debacle. He basically said the SCAR-H criteria were wrong, meaning shotgun kills made in the sniper class now wouldn't be counted, though they did before. I said: ""That's like taking away Michael Phelps' medals because the judges were taking steroids."" Two days later, I noticed my PC account was no longer Premium. No boxcutter knife, no MTAR. Unlocks gone.

* The EA customer support guy was incredibly nice. He told me a refund had been ""processed"" and that someone ""way above,"" possibly a developer, made the change. There were no notes in the system describing why this action was taken. I see no legitimate explanation: I did not request a refund. I'm not a hacker (with a .6 KD, I'm only a threat to my own team). I started on Battlefield 1942 and BF:V. I'm a long-time fan of the series. I love BF3 and have spent $220 buying it first on PS3 then again when I upgraded my PC. I was about to buy BF4 Beta for $60. Now I'm not so sure.


* My PS3 account is fine, because I don't think Sony would ever let DICE reach out and touch a product someone had purchased. My credit card account shows no refund, but the EA guy said he can't reverse the action and was passing it up to the next level. I haven't heard back. I figure others might like to know that their purchases made through Origin can be revoked.


**TL;DR.** EA/DICE, I don't want my money back. Please give me back my Premium. **EDIT:** JBRipley responds below -- wasn't him, he'll look into it Monday. **EDIT2:** EA community manager says ""I'm sure we'll get you squared away"" I say: that's all I wanted to hear. **EDIT3:** To those who wanted a Monday update, it's 3pm and no response."	t5_2rlua	True

I know what friends are online without loading the game, I can view all my stats and see the servers before I decide to load them up. I love (or when im at work, hate) that I can see whos online within 2 seconds and see what server they are in and join them straight away.

A lot of people have been asking me what the point of Platoons is. Well the way I see it is they add another layer of competition to the game. You can play in the same squad with all your mates but battlelog never lies on who contributes the most, who gets the most headshots, flag captures etc. Im locked in a pitched battle to high levels with everyone in my platoon and its great that I can check on that even when I'm not on my gaming PC.

Yes there are issues with the main game and GFX drivers etc. but they will be fixed and patched soon enough im sure. 

Battlelog is the future of games and I think its great.

Well done DICE!	sneek_	815	273	433	"I was kind of hesitant to get my hopes up for Karkand and Wake to translate properly from BF2 to BF3... but DICE really exceeded my expectations.  All my favorite hot zones of the map from BF2 Karkand are still completely intact.

One of the biggest things that surprised me though is that they didn't simply recycle existing models of buildings into a new map pack again.  Lots, if not all, are completely new and never-before seen.  Even in the vanilla maps I had been noticing a lot of left overs from BC2 but this new map pack is a breath of fresh air.  You can tell that a LOT of time went into this pack when you compare a map like Gulf of Oman to Operation Firestorm.  

Gulf of Oman is beautiful.  The unexpected city CQC is amazing - especially with the heightened sense of destruction these maps give.

I only got one Assignment unlocked last night - ""Fixing It"" but the variety of gameplay that's forced by trying to unlock these assignments is awesome.  Killing people with a blowtorch is kinda tough.

Anyway, great job DICE.  You guys are really a gamer's company.  From day 1 you guys have been working your asses off listening to our feedback - especially here on Reddit.  Keep it up!!

PS : I'd like to see a future map pack released with more OP-Metro style CQC for variety... ;) New York?  It'd be awesome to make a map that plays like CS:S on the Frostbite2 engine.

But i remember that day clearly, i was driving trough the forest on Caspian, and you were there - trying to cap the point and get points. You jumped into my tank, we capped the point, and went for B.  
You were silent, but the actions you did weren't. You shot everywhere, be that a tank, or a rock. You even tried shooting at people once, remember? Remember, on Gas Station,  how you tried shooting the enemies tank, and he spotted us, because of that? And the C4 guy, to kill whom i had to leave you alone for a few moments.
We had such a great time together, you and me, against the world, in our small cosy tank.  
In the open between the Antenna and the Control point, when our tank got disabled, you would fix it. And i will always wait for you to get in, even if you were a bit slow. Remember? The good ol' days. Even though they were harsh, we managed to stay at the top of the scoreboard.  
But then, raining death from the sky, came the chopper. We were alone, you and i, with our teams  Tunguska standing near the stationary AA. Remember? I do, I recall it every night before I go to sleep. And... sorry for the bad handwriting, it's an emotional memory for me... you were shooting the tank that was halfway on the map.  When you noticed the chopper, and bailed.  
I yelled, I cried in the chat for you to come back. But you didn't come back. You ran away, without a second thought. And I was stranded, alone, in the open of the Control Point. One, against the chopper, with no chance of escaping.  
I had to take you'r seat. Your seat, it was still warm, and smelled like liquor , and shoot at the helicopter. It was tough, Ii had to get out, and repair the tank, while the chopper wasn't firing at me, 10% at a time. Then going back to you'r place, to try and kill it.  
In the end, I won the battle. But Ii lost a friend, a brother. And not to the chopper, but to fear, and the feeling of impotence.  
After the battle, i drove to the Hilltop , as it was the place you were ran to. But you weren't there, i tried asking a few snipers, but the only thing i got in response was ""OMG A TANK ON A HILL"". I went to the Gas Station, yes, were you heroically tried to kill the hostile tank. I went to the Antennae, recklessly destroying soflams, just to find nothing, but enemies lurking behind the crates.  
This continued until I've been to every point. And we were about to win, so I drove to Hilltop, and imagined, as if you were there, on the gunners seat. With me, watching as the Antenna falls, as a sign of the victory, we achieved, Together.  

So if you are still reading, remember, that I am still waiting for you, near our special Tree, on Forest, capping the point.

LTiberious.

Input on weapons, attachments and YouTube channels wanted. I'll try to answer relevant questions posted in comments, and will include them in the FAQ.


----

**Q**: I saw someone with over 100% accuracy. How is that possible?

**A**: When you hit two or more enemies with a single projectile or explosive, Battlefield calculates this to be 200% accuracy. If you hit three people with a single projetcile or explosive you get 300% accuracy, and so on.

----

**Q**: I was flying and got shot down by a Javelin. How?

**A**: The Javelin uses a lock-on system to fire, and will normally only be able to lock on to a ground vehicle. However, if assisted with a SOFLAM (Recon), Laser Painter (attack &amp; scout helicopter) or CITV (Tank) who is ""locking on"" to a airborne vehicle, the Javelin can now lock on to this target. See this in action [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJJzoF3GSYI).

Javelin is not the only weapon that gets extended usability with assistance of SOFLAM//CITV/Laser Painter: Tank Guided shell does too (more?).

----

**Q**: Why do I sometimes have 30 bullets in my magazines? Normally I have 31?

**A**: When you have 31 bullets you have 30 in the magazine and 1 more in the chamber. This is a mechanic that has not been used in other Battlefield games. 

**Example**: You have a M16A3 and fire a short burst. You have 23 bullets left before your magazine is empty. If you reload, you will have 31 rounds. However, if you completely empty your magazine and have 0 rounds left you will get 30 rounds after reload. Reload a second time to get 31 rounds.

Reloading with a bullet in the chamber gives you shorter reload times. Reloading with 0 bullets left gives a standard reload time.


----

**Q**: What is the best weapon?

**A**: In Battlefield 3, there isn't a true ""best weapon"", for any class. What there is however, is a best weapon for any situation. Every weapon has its use, depending on what map and environment you're fighting in.Battlefield 3 has very well balanced weapons, this allows you to use weapons that you like, without being at a disadvantage. You do, however, need to use your weapons ""correctly"". Where a weapon excels depends on a variety of factors such as rate of fire, accuracy and recoil. Here's some basic rules:

* High rate of fire (AEK, F2000, FAMAS etc) = short ranges, high recoil or bullet spread.

* Low rate of fire (G3A3) = longer ranges, above average recoil and high accuracy.

* Medium rate of fire (M16A3, M416, L85A2) = all but very long ranges, low recoil and good accuracy.


I have most experience with Assault guns, and will continue to use them as examples:


**M16A3**: This US starter weapon is arguably the most widely used weapon for the assault class, and is the weapon of choice for the majority of competitive players. This is because of it's versatility.



**AK-74m**: in the latest patch this weapon had it's recoil reduced, which makes it an incredibly potent long range Assault Rifle. This is offset by it's low rate of fire, which makes it underperform at close range.



**G3A3**: A slow firing, high damage per bullet weapon with excellent accuracy and big downsides: the heaviest recoil of all assault rifles as well as the lowest number of bullets in magazine (20 + 1 in chamber). The slow rate of fire combined with the low bullet count makes this weapon mediocre in close quarters.


**AEK-971**: very high rate of fire, average accuracy and recoil makes this a very good weapon for short and medium ranges, but it will give you problems at long ranges.


Finding the best weapon, then, depends on how you play, or how well you can adjust and utilize a weapons' strenghts. Also, remember that the maps are different. A weapon that's very good on Operation Metro, might do less good on a map like Caspian Border. Adjusting weapons and attachments according to the map can be very rewarding.

----

**Q**: What attachments should I be using?

**A**: Attachments give your weapons more personality. You can make them even better for specific situations at a small cost. Let's see what the attachments do:

From [patch notes](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/news/view/2832654780279541805/)

* Heavy Barrel: Aimed accuracy bonus, hip-fire accuracy penalty, some weapons get increased bullet speed, increased maximum range.

* Foregrip: reduced horizontal sway, long range aimed accuracy penalty.

* Suppressor (Silencer): hides you from mini-map when you are firing, decreased range for when the weapon is effective, higher bullet drop, slightly lower recoil, hip fire penalty, increased aimed accuracy.

* Flash Suppressor: reduced vertical recoil, hip firing penalty.

* Laser Sight: Makes weapons more accurate when hip firing. 

* Bipod: increased accuracy, lower recoil.

Combining Foregrip with a Silencer or Heavy Barrel will offset the aimed accuracy on long range. 

Illustration for all weapons: http://i.imgur.com/7OHnO.jpg

**Generally speaking**:


* Close quarters: Foregrip, Silencer. Foregrip, Laser Sight. Laser Sight only.


* Medium ranges: Foregrip, Silencer. Silencer only. Heavy 
Barrel only.


* Long ranges: Foregrip, Heavy Barrel. Heavy Barrel only. Bipod, Heavy Barrel. 

If you want Foregrip or not is very much so up to your own preference. Try it and find out what feels right to you.

**A**: http://symthic.com/?s=bf3 !

**Q**: What are some good BF3 focused YouTube channels?

**A**:
[LevelCap](http://www.youtube.com/user/LevelCapGaming) (weapon reviews, torurials and more)


[rivalXfactor](http://www.youtube.com/user/rivaLxfactor) (high level game play) 


[VitalSyntax](http://www.youtube.com/VitalSyntax), [GwiiGwii](http://www.youtube.com/gwiigwii) and [Bo0gab](http://www.youtube.com/bo0gab) (competitive play)


[Birgirpall](http://www.youtube.com/user/birgirpall) (comedy)


----

**Q**: I got run over by a car and got the kill message ""Bad Luck"". Sup with that?

**A**: An empty vehicle in speed will kill anyone it runs over, even if the last driver was on your team.


----

**Q**: Why do I sometimes spawn in a parachute after spawning on a Spawn Beacon?

**A**: If the spawn beacon is placed outdoors you will spawn in a parachute. If the spawn beacon is indoors, you will spawn at the spawn beacon's position. This is not true for all maps, however: maps without helicopters or jets do not have this feature (Seine Crossing, Grand Bazaar, Tehran Highway, Strike at Karkand and possibly Sharqi Peninsula (unconfirmed)). No matter which way you're facing when planting the spawn beacon - you will always face North when you spawn on it.

Also, remember that spawning on your own Beacon will destroy it!


----

**Q**: I have 200h total play time, why do I not have the 100h played RU/US medals?

**A**: These two medals do not count time spent in vehicles. They are ""infantry only time"".

----

**Q**: How does the Skill stat work?

**A**:  
&gt; * You gain/lose skill level based on every confrontation with another player.

&gt;* Killing a highly skilled enemy gives you more points than killing someone less skilled.

&gt;* Points are not transferred from a player to another, they are simply added/subtracted based on the encounter and the skill level of both parts (thus, after an encounter, one part may go up 50 points while the other loses only 20).

&gt;* The skill level is used for matchmaking.

**Q**: What is good score per minute (spm)?

**A**: Note: these numbers are approximate, from PC, and are provided by BF3stats.com:

* 150 spm = top 89%


* 247 spm = top 60%


* 283 spm = top 48%. 


* 391 spm = top 22%. 


* 427 spm = top 16%


* 467 spm = top 11%


* 583 spm = top 4%


* 630 spm = top 3%. 


* 720 spm = top 1%.

**Q**: How do sniper scopes and bullet drop work?

**A**: Read all about it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield3/comments/n4ucb/ballistic_tables_and_scope_guide/), [direct link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?hl=en_US&amp;hl=en_US&amp;key=0AlINQyZ1u1XzdFc2VFYtUU9mbkNTWV8teFE4YUhka1E&amp;output=html)

Guide by [Sipa](http://www.reddit.com/user/sipa).

----

**Q**: Can Recons kill someone with 1 bullet, without hitting in the head?

**A**: Yes, they can. Sniper rifles have a chance to one-shot at close range if the player is hit in the upper chest. In Hardcore mode, sniper rifles that cause over 60 damage with one shot will always kill in one shot. These are: M98B causing 95 damage; L96, SV98 and M40A5 causing 80 damage.

----

**Q**: What is a Service Star?

**A**: There are three different types of service stars:

1. Weapon service stars: awarded every 100 kills with a weapon. Award: 2000 points.

2. Rank service stars: the highest Military rank in BF3 is 45, and is called Colonel. Once a player achieves this rank, every new rank is a Colonel Service Star that requires 230 000 points. There are 100 Colonel Service Stars, making 145 the highest rank possible. In your typical game scoreboard, the number on the golden eagle of high ranked players represents their number of Colonel Service Stars.
 
3. Class/Kit serivce stars: points required per kit service star depends on the kit, and is equal to the total number of points needed to unlock all weapons for the kit.

* Assault: 220,000 points.

* Engineer: 145,000 points.

* Support: 170,000 points.

* Recon: 195,000 points.
