FineAccoutrements	422	43	96	"It has come to my attention that six bottles of Fine American Blend Aftershave that I recently sold (presumably) to members of this forum, were mixed with a measure of menthol that was below what what was intended.  I can't tell who exactly received them, so I'm offering to send out a second bottle, free of charge and no questions asked, to anyone who ordered American Blend, and felt that the cooling effect was below expectations.

Please PM me your contact information here on Reddit, [Etsy](http://www.FineAccoutrements.com), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/FineAccoutrements), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FineAccoutrmts) for fulfillment.

American Blend is basically my flagship product, so I want to make sure everyone who purchases it get the experience that was intended.  I apologize for the inconvenience.

So after a vacuum leak was fixed in the SEM, I was able to get some images for you guys. I imaged a brand new Feather blade, and used Feather blade with 4 shaves on it, and a brand new Astra blade before I ran out of time. Keep in mind that I just started learning how to use this beast two months ago, so the images are not perfect (far from it IMO).

Some of you guys wanted to know if you could send me your SRs to image, but after talking about with my professor (SEM guru), he pointed out that a SR would be far too large a sample to image. You run the risk of the razor bumping into the various detectors in the chamber. The slightest contact and they can break. They aren't cheap either. A DE blade is just about the largest sample you can use in this particular SEM.

Album: [Enjoy!](http://imgur.com/a/JQxQV) Be sure to check out the comments on each image on imgur.

EDIT: I added a picture of the SEM that was used, and a few others showing the blades on the stage about to go into the chamber. "	t5_2s46m	True

Remember - not to be a bubble burster here, but we are talking about shaving. Its just shaving. I see obsessive collectors, and people posting pictures of their unnecessarily large amazon haul. Then theres the us agaist them mentality to those who use Mach3s. I mean trust me I understand that discovering this all for the first time is cool and fun.... But I guess all im saying is dont turn this into some hivemind obsessive consumer culture. Enjoy it, but also remember to put it in its place. 

EDIT: Im glad this topic strikes a chord. If all this post does is make you think about whether its materialism that's driving you or not - then this post has done exactly what id hoped. Also alot of people getting defensive which im suspecting is because they are worried I might have a point. Im not necessarily talking about you!

Edit2: You guys are focusing too much on the collector jab. Not all collectors are like this.  My point is deeper then just that. It's about the mentality that goes behind all this and the psychology of consumerism/materialism. Just wanted to introduce that angle into this sub. "	t5_2s46m	True

However, the hallways in my building have emergency lights running 24/7, powered by a generator.  After a week of not being able to shave, I said fuck it, and used a window in the hallway. Not the greatest reflection, but it served.  I decided it best to only make one pass, as I use a straight razor, and really really don't want to tempt fate with my shitty reflective surface.

As I live in a college dorm, the hallways are very busy. My favorite comments are:

""Is this real life?""

""Dude, are you painting your face?""

""Babe, you should get a straight razor like that guy! It looks so cool.""

""Ah, here we see the the college male, debased to savagery, shaving in communal space""


What I've learned: 
Power outages can't stop me.
Hurricanes can't stop me. Shaving in a window is scary.

Promptly removing it from the scanner and setting it aside. I asked what the problem was, but they wouldn't say... Just that they were waiting on someone to look at something. About 10mins later, two security personal came up and had the guy at the scanner bring up the xray of my bag. I immediately say what was obviously the shaft of my razor, and said as much. 

They stared at the image a little longer, before telling me they would have to look inside my bag. I said,  ""no problem"" and showed them where the razor was located. I had to put it together for them, before they figured out that it was safe. I told them I didn't bring any blades. They were about to let me go, but then one of the guys saw my soap puck and asked what it was and I explained that it was shaving soap. He questioned that as well... Until I told him it was the equivalent of shaving cream, but for wet shaving. 

Eventually I was let go.

1366746789.0	1cyh0x	How Wicked Edge Saved My Life	jon94	340	77	73	"In my sophomore year of high school (2009), a combination of unfortunate home life and a few months of an abusive relationship sent me into a deep depression. I began self harming as well as not taking care of myself in general, which allowed my [Crohn's Disease](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn%27s_disease) to spiral out of control. After several operations, I realized that I couldn't live this way anymore. More importantly, I decided that I didn't want to. Around June of 2010, I got help and spent the next two years in a much better place. 

Fast forward to January 2013. As I've mentioned in other posts, I'm a freshman in college at a private (read:expensive) research school in the Midwest. Adding insult to injury, I'm studying Biology (premed track) at a school where only 10% of all incoming premeds actually graduate as such. Needless to say, it's easy to get beaten down.

As if this wasn't enough, at the beginning of the semester, I ended things with a girl I had been seeing for a few months. I had a number of reasons, but mostly, to put it bluntly, she had problems with being honest and faithful. I immediately fell back into the self harm and depression, and began living in the library so I could at least feel successful at something in my life. 

I knew I needed something, a hobby, an activity, anything, to distract me (studying Chemsitry all night doesn't really help in that department). I had been using the AoS set up for a while, but with a cartridge razor. I'd always wanted to try the real deal, so I eventually saved my pennies and bought myself a shavette and one of WhippedDog's straight razors. 

The difference this seemingly menial task made in my life was unbelievable. Taking the time to strop a blade properly, apply warm, soothing lather to my face, and then shave with care and focus cleared my head and allowed me 20 minutes of time free of any thought beyond blade angle, pressure, and grain. No Biology, no girlfriends, nothing but the ringing of hair cut by a full hollow blade.

Even with my newfound (and still being found) peace of mind, the past two weeks have been rough for me. I found a present from the previously mentioned girl outside my room at exactly midnight on my birthday. Inside was a beautiful set of crystal whisky tumblers (if you've read some of my posts, you know that when it comes to guilty pleasures, scotch is second only to straight razors). I called her to thank her, and we began talking again. Before I knew it, we were pretty much back together. 

Now I'm sure y'all are waiting for the twist, or simply saying, ""The dumbass is already screwed."" To those of you who feel the former, you're right. To the second group, you've clearly seen this situation before. After about a week of being with this girl, she informs me that she made out with her best guy friend the day after my birthday. I sort of shrugged it off since we still weren't really together at that point. Over the past week though, the situation evolved from a one-time accidental drunk makeout to ""I think I love him and have to try it so I can know."" On Sunday night, after admitting that she knew how much she was hurting me by doing this and that she realized how unfairly she had treated me, she decided to break up with me and be with him.

For those of you waiting for the twist, that wasn't it. After I heard this from her (over the phone, not in person), I finished my work at the library and came home. It was well after 2:00 AM (remember, us college students keep odd hours), and I walked into my completely dark room. I set my things down and went into the bathroom, rummaging through my shave kit until I found what I was looking for: a brand new and razor sharp Gillette Platinum double edged razor blade. 

I ran some hot water and lathered up. Thank you, Wicked Edge.

I have just come to the realization, after my latest attempt with a straight razor, that I have zero fucking clue what I am doing.

I'd heard that a sharp straight razor can give you a good shave, I'm prone to turning my face into a gory mess anyway (I normally use a safety razor or, in a pinch, a cartridge razor), so I went and bought a nice expensive Dovo cutthroat.

Tried it once, mess.  Came here, was told I need to get rid of the ""factory hone"".

Went to a specialty razor shop, was told ""factory hone?  The fuck is that?""  (I live ca. 100km from Solingen so I assume they kind of know what they're talking about.)  But they humored me and sent it in to a master razor sharpener (apparently that's a thing here) who worked his Teutonic magic on it.  Cost me 12 Euros.  I assume that did it; it can't be that I need the $300 magic Japanese plutonium-infused grinding stone and fairy elf paste to make a razor do what it's supposed to do.  I.e. cut shit.  

Since then, I've tried it a few times.  Read through the various FAQs (most of which went totally over my simplistic head, I am not a clever man), tried the hair trick, could not get the hair to balance on the blade for long enough (how _do_ you do that?), did the stroppy thing with the paste I was given at the shop, taking extra mega crazy care to not even _think_ about putting the edge on the strop (or any other surface) the wrong way, and went to work.

I'm blond, 39, not terribly fat, with somewhat sensitive skin (thickened by a lifetime of cynicism and snark) can't really judge how thick or rough my stubble is compared to others' (I'm not in the habit of sneakily feeling strange men's beards) but I assume it's sort of ""medium"".

So, this morning, sporting 2 days of Don Johnson Miami Vice manlystubble (minus the pink t-shirt, I'm so naturally butt-white that I don't need that) straight out of the nice piping hot shower, face full of heated Art of Shaving oil (yes I am sure there are vastly better brands made by blind Tibetan monks out of yak secretions, and I can make my own for a lot cheaper by boiling potato oil through a homemade still at midnight on a full moon, but I kind of assumed that this should do the trick to _some_ degree).  

Using LaToja cream out of a tube (the red stuff - I read somewhere that it's pretty good, it costs about 2 bucks a pop in the supermarket around the corner, dumped it in a tub of hot water, squeezed some into a copper bowl with a bit of hot water, whipped up a good lather, and applied with a badger brush.  I have no idea which of this is relevant, but given the hilariously absurd amount of attention to detail in the various instruction pages (""ensure a precisely 32.7 degree angle after using water heated to **exactly** - this is important -- 78° C in a 20% brimstone, 80% Lutetium alloy bowl otherwise you will DIE, FOOL"") I figure, maybe this is somehow relevant.

I'm also sure I should probably be using the 1915 model LaBourrée-Stinkfinger 15mm Toledo special, the last true razor made before those inbred bastard communists at Gillette ruined it all, but it is what it is, and my ancestors seemed to do a reasonable job removing hair from face, and they thought the Earth was flat and women were too dumb to vote, so it's not a far stretch that I, as the pinnacle of 45,000 years of human evolution should be able to fucking shave.

I don't know about you, but my criteria for shaving are threefold:

a) doesn't take half the morning

b) does not leave my face a cratered, bloody charnel house

c) removes whiskers from aforementioned face

Let's perform a gap analysis vis-à-vis above deliverables:

a) Fail.  Cause:  most likely lack of practice and clue and little-girl level of squeamishness when it comes to the possibility of self-inflicting serious bodily harm with an instrument not necessarily designed by Klaus the Angry Master German Knifemaker with the express purpose of being hidden down a vengeful Sicilian's boot and used to motivate some _paisan_ to repay his debt (or to get him to repay in kind with a finger or part of his ear), but at least probably very good at this task as a secondary function.  We'll let this one pass for now.  

b) Fail.  I've seen photos of the Somme battlefield after Maj. Gen. Lord F'tang-F'tang Ole Biscuit Barrel, CBE, PDQ, decided it would be a good idea to match his men's naked valor against entrenched Hun machine guns, that involved less blood and cratering than my mug.  I did not know that the human body contained this much blood.  I think I can see the bone.  On the back of my head.  I don't need a styptic pencil, I need a styptic paintbrush, you know, the big ones that the house painters use.

c) No Less Than Total Fail.  With remarkable German technological efficiency, my beautiful singing blade managed to cleverly and consistency evade all the hair parts and cut straight through to the face part, working its miracle with the skin part and unleashing the blood part.  It took me about half an hour to de-disgustify the sink and environs, which involved removing a greasy batter of gore, shaving cream, oil, drool, and tears from pretty much every nook and cranny in my bathroom.    

I ended up having to clean up my face with my safety razor (some sort of random blades, I never checked, they work) - the only difference I noticed was that I felt like I was shaving one day's worth of stubble as opposed to the two I'd started out with.  Now, I am not a scientist, but empirically speaking, this cannot be the point of the exercise.

I fenced and did Kendo for a few years.  I was never very good at it, usually ending up being thoroughly and embarrassingly trounced by some wispy little girl who ended up flying at me in a whirlwind of skirts and screaming before proceeding to wallop the living unholy snot out of me, like some airborne Japanese anime demon hellspawn.  If these midget harridans had had real sharp steel blades instead of bamboo poles or rubber tipped épées, I don't think they could have inflicted the kind of damage that I managed to do this morning.  

What am I doing wrong?  Please?  Help me?  It is irking me.  Also, I am weak from loss of blo

_Edit:_ since I'm being called out for a bunch of stuff, permit me to address the various bits and bobs:

- ""You are a n00b"" - yes I am.  Utterly so.  This is why I come to the masters as a humble supplicant.
- ""You are being disrespectful"" - geez, hypersensitive much?  if I were being disrespectful, I wouldn't bother trying to RTFM or practice first, nor to attempt phrasing my plea for advice in a form that I'd hoped would at least be halfway entertaining.  Next time I shall try monosyllabic guttural grunts and bullet points right off the bat. 
- ""You are not telling us about technique"" - I stretch the skin, shave with the grain, use short strokes, don't apply pressure.  I've tried various angles, various degrees of pressure, even shaving against the grain or multiple strokes.  I'm willing to try anything.  Apologies if I'm missing anything here, I'm simply not aware of some subtle elements of ""technique"".  It's shaving, ffs.
- ""You are impatient"" - I'm 39.  I've taught myself 2 languages.  I've been with the same woman for almost half my life.  I'm long past the age of throwing VCRs through windows when I can't figure out how to set the clock (one of the great things about being my age is that I now earn enough to buy high-powered handguns, which makes VCR disposal far more fun.)  If I were impatient, I wouldn't keep trying, I'd just say ""fuck this"" and leave the razor buried in the rear left tire of the son of a bitch who keeps taking my parking space.  Rather, I am trying something new that I have read copious good things about, and am trying to figure out how to do it right.  Half an hour is fine, I understand it takes time.  I'm giving myself at least that amount of time from start to finish, if only to avoid removing major facial features.  Cut me some slack.
- ""What is your DE / if you keep cutting yourself with your DE why do you use it"" - It says ""Merkur Super"" and ""Platinum Coated"" on it.  Super is good, right?  Platinum too, right?  Also, it says ""Made in Germany"". I didn't think Germans were allowed to sell shitty knives, or they get made fun of and taken outside to be beaten by Klaus.  The DE works.  Kind of.  I've been using it for two years now because it's cheaper and it makes me feel manlier and more ready to go wrestle bears 'n shit.  Chicks dig that.  But I like choice, y'know?  It's the essence of why we won the Cold War.  But even after 2 years, I still face (ha ha) the choice of either looking like John Travolta/Nicholas Cage in Face/Off or having sweetie complain about stubble during private time.  This shall not stand.
- ""Honing / Sharpening"" - I appear to have offended at least one person by Doing It Wrong.  WTF do I know?  I tried it straight out of the box, that didn't work.  I figured, if all else fails, RTFM, so I RTFM'ed and plunged straight down the fucking rabbit hole of really obscure sharpening videos and calculating techniques for getting the optimum analog gain from your razor blade.  I already caught shit for trying to use the factory hone, so I had it sharpened.  That didn't work, so I stropped it.  What am I supposed to do?  I appreciate that this is as much art as science, but it can't be _that_ complicated, can it?  I mean, I'm trying to scrape hair off my face, not beat Battletoads.
- ""You're giving us too much detail about toys"" - well hey, read some of the guides linked in the sidebar from the perspective of a total n00b (which I am) and you tell me that its not total drinking-shaving-cream-from-a-firehose technical detail overload.   I used to work in tech support.  Giving all potentially relevant information was always seen as a Good Thing.  I _really_ don't know what other information to provide. 
- ""You need to practice"" - okay, fair enough, I do need to practice. That's what I'm doing.  But there's practice that consists of continuing to beat your head against the wall and practice that consists of figuring out that you actually should be using a hammer to pound in a nail correctly.  I'm just kind of curious at this point whether, as a reasonably adaptable, somewhat resourceful and moderately intelligent person, I'm expecting 10, 20, 50, 100, 1000 rounds in the ring with Mack the Knife.  
- ""Try turning it off and then on again"" - I can't find the switch underneath all the blood."	t5_2s46m	True

1325791824.0	o4b9a	I hate this subreddit and all you WEdges.	TreeFittyZ	242	34	76	"I have been lurking this subreddit for a few months now, and now I hate you all.

I am 42 yrs old and have always disliked shaving. From my days in the Navy, where my beard was so tough and dark, I often had to shave for a second time that day just to leave the ship because my 5 o'clock shadow was close to a normal person's full day growth, to trying to find the best cartridge razor/shaving cream/aftershave/voo-doo witch doctor chant for a close, comfortable shave.

About a year and a half ago, my wife bought me a shaving gift kit (brush, soap, aftershave balm) from The Art Of Shaving as a gift and I fell in love with making my own lather (which, incidentally sucked). I subsequently lost the brush while traveling, and in looking for a new one, found W_E.

Since then, you bastages (especially that Leisureguy dude) have me spending money left and right. I have bought/received as gifts:

* A new beaver brush (the reason I came here)
* Leisureguy's book (Kindle version)
* Edwin Jagger DE89lbl razor with sample pack
* Proraso pre/post shave cream
* Proraso shaving soap
* Mitchell's Wool Fat shaving cream
* Jojoba oil
* Alum Block

Fine. It's money. I've wasted more on dumber things, but I am not done here. It's not enough to hurt me financially, but now I am also *looking forward to shaving*!!! WTF is that?!?!?

Ok, fine. You've turned a task I used to hate into an enjoyable experience. Good on ya. But today was the final straw.

You see, I work from home. I have the luxury of being able to browse Reddit throughout the day when I have time. I have the luxury of being able to go take a shower/shave in the middle of the day if I want. Sounds awesome, right? WRONG! Here is what happens; I am browsing Reddit, and come to WE. Oh look, some more posts by n00bs like me that are having the same issues I am! Hey, look!! Some great responses with good advice! I should try that! Come to think of it, I have a free hour and I need to shave! Time to go put these tidbits into practice!

So I go have a nice hot shower, and shave. Some great improvements in lather by using my new information. Even some improvements in shave as my technique improves. Overall, not the best shave I have had, but definitely not the worst. And I am not bleeding.

So, I return to my desk enjoying the feeling my face has and lo and behold, WE is still open. So I read some more. And I find MORE tidbits. BUT I JUST FINISHED SHAVING!!! And now I have to wait until at least tomorrow, and more likely 2 days from now, to put those into practice. 48 hrs of waiting to shave again. And I just know this whole cycle will repeat itself again on that day, and I am helpless to stop it.

I hate you guys.

I have access to a couple of different very expensive scanning electron microscopes through my school. We are allowed to bring in our own samples but I've had a hard time coming up with something cool to bring in. 

Would anybody be interested in seeing blades under a scanning electron microscope? I could take a brand new feather blade and only shave on one side of it and show a side-by-side comparison.

I could also do a characteristic X-ray analysis on it and tell you what elements are present in the blades.

EDIT: Ok so the idea seems popular enough lol. I will try to schedule some time to take images next week.

I tracked down my grandfathers safety razor (i have no idea on the make and model) and picked up other gear and dove in.

I found myself thinking about him every time i shaved, he died with i was just 6 and the razor is a connection to him and my past. a physical object we both shared. I often wonder about the types of things he thought about when he was shaving.

It makes me wonder what type of man he was.  I never knew my dad growing up so i had no idea what it meant to be a man. I often reflect on what kind of man i am, and what kind of man i want to be; and what kind of man i want my son to grow up to be.  

Taking your time and shaving properly allows men to think about things we would not normally think about, focus on ourselves both externally and internally. Its sort of a meditative ritual. 

I think these sort of actions are what helps define us as modern men and what it is to be a man.

i see a lot of posts on here about the kits everyone uses, and the materials as if its just one big show and tell; and i guess that's fine if that is what you are into.

I'm more interested in why do you shave the way you do? did it start off as something that looked cool and grow into something more, or is it all about the looks?

AcousticRanger	226	41	44	"As some of you know, I love feeling clean shaven... however, I won't be shaving for a few days.  I have a nephew with a disease called epidermolysis bullosa.  You can look here for a definition http://www.debra.org/understanding

One of the sad facts about this disease is that, if he lives long enough to need to shave, he'll probably not be able to without causing his face to break out in blisters. 

With that in mind I've started a fund raiser for one of the groups that has helped my nephews family through the process of finding care and supplies to care for their child.  For every dollar my friends and family donate (I advertised on facebook) I'll be going 1 day without shaving.  So far I'll be noshaving till just before Christmas.  I think it will be a little uncomfortable but if it helps find a cure (which looks like it could be on the horizon with stem cell implants) then I'll survive being a little uncomfortable. 

Here is a little more info and a picture of my nephew... it's also the site i'm using to fund raise.  https://secure.commonground.convio.com/debra/personalfundraising/project.html?personalFundraisingProjectId=a0qA0000001yg8FIAQ

1359047420.0	1774zj	Alum v. styptic	Leisureguy	211	29	118	"I see there's still some confusion regarding the alum block and the styptic (pencil, liquid, gel, etc.). 

A styptic's purpose is specifically to stop the bleeding from a nick or cut, and it is used only in the event of a nick or cut.

An alum block's purpose is to serve as a skin treatment, and it is used after every shave, whether or not a nick or cut occurs. An alum block can indeed be used as a (not very effective) styptic, but that use is secondary. It will stop bleeding from weepers, but a real nick or cut is beyond its pay grade, at least for me. NOTE: Some men's skin is sensitive to alum and they simply cannot use it: skin turns red, gets hot, becomes irritated, etc. 

In using the block, one glides the *dry* block over the wet beard following the final rinse: the water on the face is ample. Let it sit a moment or two while you clean up around the sink, then rinse it off, dry, and apply aftershave. Rinsing helps prevent the alum from drying the skin; alum crystals used as deodorants are not rinsed---these are generally ammonium alum, but occasionally you'll find one that's potassium alum (e.g., [Naturally Fresh](http://www.amazon.com/Naturally-Fresh-Deodorant-Crystal-4-25-Ounce/dp/B002JVWU2E/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1359049817&amp;sr=8-10&amp;keywords=deodorant+crystal)) that can then be used as an alum block. (Ammonium alum stings too much for pleasant use.)

Powdered alum does work well as a styptic---at any event, better than an alum block---but a look at styptic products shows that alum is not a favored ingredient. My favorite styptic, [My Nik Is Sealed](http://www.shaveplace.com/my-nik-is-sealed.asp), has these ingredients:

&gt;Aluminum Chloride, Benzocaine USP, SD Alcohol 38 B, Methylcellulose, Phenyl Salicylate, Bergamot (Citrus Aurantium Bergamia) Oil, Vitamin A &amp; E, Aloe Vera (Aloe Barbadensis) Leaf Juice

Another popular styptic is Pacific Shaving's Nick Stick. Its ingredients:

&gt;SD Alcohol (Ethyl Alcohol), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice, Water (Aqua), Aluminum Chloride Hexahydrate, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Hydroxypropylcellulose

Clubman Nick Relief lists only Aluminum Sulfate as an active ingredient. 

You'll note that none of these contain potassium alum (aka potash alum), the material of which the alum block is made. I imagine they omitted that because, as noted, it is not very good as a styptic. Those listed are quite good styptics. I don't know the ingredients of Proraso styptic gel, but I would wager that it also does contains no potassium alum.

I should also speak to the continuing speculation (not, so far as I can tell, based on any peer-reviewed research) that using an alum block is a health risk. 

Aluminum may or may not be a health risk, but an alum block is a compound containing aluminum, a horse of a totally different color. Chlorine, for example, is definitely a health risk---indeed, it's deadly---but as part of the compound sodium chloride (table salt) it is necessary for life. (Salt can, of course, be a health risk if overused, but that health risk has nothing whatsoever to do with chlorine per se.)

TL;DR: An alum block and a styptic serve different purposes and are not redundant. An alum block is not a health risk.

Firstly, I hope this isn't against the rules to ask for donations on here, I couldn't find anything in the wiki regarding it, but I also hope I don't come across as rude or begging for donations, I just thought I'd ask you guys since I haven't had any in the past month!

I'm a year 12 student in Australia, and I'm gonna do my whole sexy lather dance in front of the entire school tomorrow along with other people shaving their heads. My beard has become quite recognised by my peers and teachers, I'd had it for about a year now (nothing too seedy, just a mo and goatee, I trim it I swear) but it is decent length and I'm gonna shave it all off! And I'll be shaving my head too.

I also hope to show some of the guys in my year who I can see struggle with their electrics or Gillette Pro Fusion Mach 500 Quantum Extra VII the real deal.

As an added bonus, I will send a thank you package of Otoko Organics Shave Soap (usually pretty hard to get in the U.S from Aus) to whoever is the top contributor!

[Here](http://my.leukaemiafoundation.org.au/aydengraham) is my page where you can donate! Thank you!

Also, this is taken from the FAQ regarding overseas donations:

&gt; Can someone sponsor me from overseas?
Of course!

&gt;- Our system accepts donations in Australian dollars via VISA and MasterCard from overseas

&gt;- Make sure your sponsor selects their country FIRST when they're entering their address details so that our system will accept a non-Australian address

&gt;- Your online donors will still receive a receipt via email but they'll need to check with their financial advisor about whether the donation is tax-deductible if they live outside Australia


I also wanna say a massive thank you to all of Wicked_Edge, I've been shaving for a few months now (I don't really consider what I was doing before shaving, rather sanding) and I absolutely love it. I've picked up a life long skill and hobby.

Thank you!

Update: It went pretty well, we raised over $5500 AUD as a school so far. I felt a bit rushed infront of all those people so I nicked myself on the ear and wasn't as careful as I could have been on my face. I didn't get any video, but /u/jashank (a good friend) took some good photos! 

[Here is a large album](http://imgur.com/a/568IQ), photos and descriptions courtesy entirely of him. I apologise in advance for my horrible, cringe-inducing teenager skin. Nothing to be done about it, unfortunately. Wetshaving has definitely helped control my acne though.

I also ended up shaving the legs of some guy who had a botched wax job, so that was weird. But he now has BSS legs, and a bit of knowledge in wetshaving. A few of my friends have inquired about wetshaving in general and shown interest, so there's some hope! One of us.

So far I only got $10 from two of you guys, but it means a lot! You can still donate until the end of the month through my page, but otherwise I encourage you to donate to cancer research or another charity you are passionate about, it feels a lot better than you think it will to part with even a few dollars.

Thanks again!"	t5_2s46m	True

1350995832.0	11xyf2	DO NOT Disassemble your DE razor every shave to dry it.	NoHelmet	217	57	75	"I've been seeing this with an alarming frequency lately. There is absolutely no reason to take your razor apart to dry it or to wipe the blade in or out of the razor. Hot water off the tap run over the head for 30 seconds, and shaking the razor off is more than sufficient to dry it. If you're especially worried, dip the head in high test rubbing alcohol after the hot water rinse.

**Reasons not to take your razor apart to dry it**

* It is unnecessary with modern stainless steel blades. The most you'll ever see these blades do is form light stain rust. It's fine. Don't worry about it. It's normal. Won't hurt a thing.

* Risk of cuts. You're handling something very sharp, small, and wet. Not the best of ideas. 

* Damage to blade. You're removing the coating that helps keep the blade from rusting, and you're damaging the cutting edges (I don't care how careful you are. It's being damaged if one towel fiber drags along it.)

* Excess wear on razor threads. Threads last a relatively long time, but as any owner of an old Gillette can tell you, they wear out. Those old Gillettes are brass. New razors are largely Zinc; a much softer metal. You are reducing your razors life by a very high percentage. 

There is no good reason to disassemble and dry. Not one. You're doing more harm than good, I guarantee you. Please stop this needless, and unsafe practice."	t5_2s46m	True

Of course, there are many newbie/novice posts, and I think these are what stimulate the expertise: newbies/novices ask a lot of questions, and in trying to answer the questions, we guys with more experience (whether a little or a lot) have to think things through, examine what we do and why, and sometimes try an experiment or two. The result of treating the questions seriously and really trying to provide good answers is upward pressure on expertise: we ourselves end up with a better understand of what we do and why we do it, and we often have to extend our range a bit (to try a new product, process, or technique). Whereas dismissing a questions doesn't lead to any help for anyone, treating the question seriously can be quite educational for everyone. 

It's often said that the best way to really understand a subject is to teach it, and this is a teaching forum about shaving. No wonder the level of understanding is steadily increasing.

My almost 12 year old son has had some darkish peach fuzz on his upper lip for a while now and just tonight said that he wanted to shave it off.  When I was his age (which extended a few more years), I had quite the peach fuzz 'stache.  It.  Looked. Bad.  Needless to say, I'm glad the little man wanted to rid himself of it.  We did the full deal; started with a warm cloth on the face, I showed him how to make lather with some Col Conks Bay Rum and a badger brush.  I gave him his very own early '70's Gillette black handled adjustable and showed him how to load a fresh Astra blade.  We practiced on our arms to get the feel as well.  He did great, no nicks or cuts.  He finished up with a few swipes of Razorock and some Nivea sensitive skin balm.  

I'd like to thank this subreddit, Leisureguy, and mantic59's videos for teaching me how to shave the way that my dad should have taught me. I have now started to pass it down.

I wanted to give myself a back-to-school present, so I decided to make a trip into the city and get myself a shave at The Art of Shaving. So, I walked in, said I wanted a shave, and I was led to the barber chair.

Here's where things go awry:

The barber, whose name I don't know because he never gave it to me, set the hot towel on my face for about 15 seconds, put the pre-shave oil on, and then proceeded to lather my face with shaving cream. (Without a brush, mind you.) 

The shave was extremely rushed. So rushed in fact that I was actually scared that he was going to do some serious damage. He made about 9 or 10 strokes before wiping the blade on the towel each time (Which seemed like a bit much.) Altogether, the prep, shave, and after shave stuff only lasted a total of about 15 minutes, at most.

I paid and left, went into the mall bathroom and checked my face. It was bad. I had at least 3 or 4 bloody nicks, it looked extremely patchy, and he completely missed several spots behind my jaw-line. The bottom of my neck was also extremely irritated with bumps everywhere.

So, that's my story. I just needed to rant somewhere.

I don't know what it is about shaving that brings out the best in people, but this is by far one of the happiest online communities on reddit. I started running properly a few months ago and subscribed to r/running, and not to give it too hard a time, but there are spin-offs devoted to taking the piss out of beginner runners (r/runningcirclejerk), there are constantly posts on from people asking if beginners could please refrain from posting about beginner level runs, and recently one of my favorite parts of the board (seeing pictures of routes that people run on - which inspires me to find new places) got a chunk of the community up in arms about how it's wasting space on the front page. Now we have r/runningroutes! Not to mention, the people who consider themselves a cut above started r/advancedrunning.

When I compare this to Wicked_Edge the comparison is quite stunning. When I log on I see the same deluge of ""first shave!"", ""just got my kit!"" etc. posts that are always there, mixed in with many questions that could be answered with google or subreddit searches. Yet people up vote the newbies because we all remember that stage, that excitement, and we want to help out and make a brother (or more rarely, a sister) feel good about what path they've set out upon. Within the discussions people continuously answer the same questions from beginners (how many times have *you* seen Leisureguy link to a distiller water shave!), and they do it with good humor and enthusiasm. People post pictures of gear which for the most part is entirely un-unique - yet even these pictures are up voted because people on *this* subreddit want people to feel excited and accepted by this community.

I personally have been here nearly a year. I first stumbled across it through r/malefashionadvice or r/malegrooming or something, and I got interested, having always hated shaving. My ""dumb"" questions were always answered, my photos of new gear were excitedly commented on by others, I bought a third razor off the shave_bazaar, and before long I was posting on other people's questions because -thanks to this subreddit - I had all the information to answer the questions, also informed by my own experiences and experimentation.

So Wicked_Edge, I thank you, for not only have you changed my life for the better, but you did it and continue to do it without the whining and douchebaggery that seems to inflict so many other places on reddit.

Do not buy this product unless you are looking for a pocket knife. Don't buy this product at all as woot delete all the negative comments about this product.

From: straightrazor   
&gt;@alfredenigma: Yes they have forums with thousands of lusers that they give specific instructions to come here and down vote my WOOTs the owners and operators of these forums also own online razor shops...
An exact quote I just pulled off one of the forums today:
[–]jersully 
DO go downvote the product on Woot's page (registration required, but you should Woot anyway.) :p
It would be one thing if a WOOTer had an issue and downvoted a vendor/product however this weekly shill-bidding from the competition is rather immature. They are just a bit angry at the new kid on the block that wont play by their ""rules"".

Luke

My response:
&gt;@straightrazor: Oh look there you go with the slander again. No one on that post owns a shaving business. If your going to quote someting you should link it as well http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/o6so4/do_not_buy_the_straight_razor_leather_cloth_strop/ 

&gt;And why should anyone buy that pocket knife, even you can't shave with it, if you could then where is the video I challenged you to make 3 months ago ""1080p video no cuts no edits no leaving the field of view with the razor and enough stubble that we can see that it really shaves.""

1346945644.0	zgbol	Tried Mach 3 again, after few months of DE/shavette shaving.	LeTimmy	147	21	96	"This is going to be blasphemy, but here goes.

I was shaving with triple blade Gilette disposables and canned cream for a few years, after discovering that showering before shaving made the process a lot more tolerable than using an electric hair ""puller"" (I don't know if it's me, but those swivel-head electric razors are ridiculously ""tuggy""). I have butchered my face with different single and double blade razors before, finally settling on these. Not particularly happy, not too sad.

After that, I was experimenting with Wilkinson Sword DE, Edwin Jagger DE86 and Dovo shavette for a few months, reading up on products and technique and I like the results. No big casualties, except a few ear-nicks (with shavette) and sometimes a little skin irritation due to too much pressure or too many passes. Shaves have progressed from passable to smooth and likeable. I can usually get only 2 shaves out of a razor blade, with the notable exception of yellow Bic, that dies after a single shave..

I'm currently using a cheap Wilkinson bristle brush and ARCO soap. For backup I have a can of proraso foam (haven't needed it for a while). Going to upgrade the brush soon and lusting after a straight razor, but that's another topic.

Aaanyway. The question has been nagging at the back of my head. Is the DE really better than the multiblades? There is a lot of talk about skin irritation and the superiority of DE, to the point where it approaches circle jerking. Any other opinion almost equals going against the grain on the first pass.

So I went to the store, bought a discount Mach 3, let 48 hours pass after the last shave (which was pretty damn good by my own standards) and gave it a go.

Took a shower, whipped up a nice solid lather (is this arco stuff magical or what?), did two passes (WTG, XTG), being light with pressure and... [cue the drumroll]

It was ok.

I would say, it's completely comparable to a good DE shave, maybe even feels a teeny bit smoother. After DE the hair feel a bit ""sharp"", after mach 3 they feel more ""duller"" when rubbing with fingers, if it makes sense. I don't know if I'm going to wake up tomorrow with a horrible razor rash and thousand ingrown hair, but at the moment, I'm confused.

What to make of this? 

I realize ""mileage may vary"". There is certainly carryover of skills from shaving with DE. Chrome looks and feels fantastic. Razor blades are cheaper than cartridges. There is that manly man feel when handling sharp, shiny objects. There is that ""traditional"" sense of lineage when I look at my grandfathers razors.

But I don't know at the moment, if I can go around claiming that DE is the best thing after sliced bread and multiblade razors are an evil corporate conspiracy. Based on that single experiment, I could deduce that they are if nothing else, ""comparable"" in performance.

If you remember the time when decent digital cameras entered the market, there was a nostalgic, passionate crowd arguing that film was good, forever and irreplaceable. Now, digital surpasses film in many respects and this movement is reduced to mostly hipsters, poor students and artists who prefer the particular subtle ""look and feel"" of the process or result. Most people, who either do photography for a living or just want to take pictures, have moved on to digital.

Is DE and straight razor fandom a similar phenomenon, powered by nostalgia, hipsterdom and anti-establishmentism? Are they a good, unforgiving learning instrument? Would just a little bit of education and technique make multiblades shine in performance?

Discuss.

TL;DR Mach 3 ""is ok"".

Edit: 

Thank you for your thoughts. It has been a refreshing experience to read these answers and it has helped me with this philosophical and spiritual snag.

This ""experiment"" was mostly inspired by bloggers and forum members, who are almost evangelical about the benefits of DE shaving, presenting smoother shave, less skin irritation and ingrown hair as the main reasons to switch over, claiming that cartridge razors are ""pure evil"". I didn't feel that was quite right, at least in my case. 
Still, DE shaving may not be the ""best thing ever"" as sometimes flaunted, but it certainly has it's own benefits. Cartridges may not be as crappy as presented, but they are expensive.

To those who asked: I'm still alive and well the day after. No signs of razor burn, ingrown hair or imminent death.

At the end of the day, I will most certainly continue the quest for the ""best shave ever"" and DE will certainly be in my weapon rack."	t5_2s46m	True

The product being offered on this deal is a pocket knife shaped like a straight razor. The steel is not tempered correctly and will not hold an edge. 

The seller is using a kitchen knife sharper to hone the razors as he has yet to provide any proof otherwise. You can shave your arm hair or legs with a pocket knife but never try to shave your face with one. 

I got this deal a while back and honed the razor up myself and the blade was tugging after half a pass on my cheek hair. Technique is not the issue the steel is.

1326209913.0	oawmo	Dear Wicked Edge, I'm about ten shaves in, and I've decided to make a list of noobie mistakes I've made that I wish I'd read.	MontyAtWork	147	23	62	"I'm going to go step by step here with the parts of the shave that I've learned:

1.) Shower first before a shave when starting out.

I never was used to showering before a shave and I can tell you that for ANY beginner, you must do this. This may not be necessary for some or many later on, but until you have your technique down, don't give your face more reasons to be torn up.

2.) Pre shave soap is more like pre lather than it is a face wash (ie, don't clean it off your face like face wash.)

The pre shave soap has work to do on your face during the shave so washing it off defeats the purpose. I now think of it as an ingredient like in a baking recipe, it's supposed to be in the mix.

3.) If you're using a small bowl with a puck in it, loading the brush and lathering in the bowl is incorrect (or actually just really difficult)

I got a Van der Hagen premium shave set and just put the puck in the bowl. Well the lather would build between the puck and bowl at the bottom and getting it out of there was a pain. The reason is that the bowl was meant to not have the puck in it, and was meant to just be the place you swirl the brush after you brushed it over the puck.

3.) Flick your razor over the water after you rinse between passes.

I was just dipping it in the water, then water on the razor would drip off the razor and kind of wash the lather down my face.

4.) If the lather feels pasty, or thick like toothpaste, dip the tip of your brush in water and run it over your whole face.

5.) Lathering is messy!

I was used to can shaving cream that came out basically the same every time and I'd apply it as needed. With a brush, and with low experience, your lathering won't be uniform every time, and using a brush on your face isn't as mess free as a little canned shaving cream on your hand.

6.) Do NOT make a pass over unlathered skin!

Did you do a terrible pass just now compared to your other passes, because you weren't putting enough pressure or angle? Good, get it on the next lathered pass. You suck right now and it's OK. Do NOT get the same spot again on that pass where there's now no lather because it was taken away by your crappy pass.

7.) Listen to your razor, the sound it's making will tell you when beard direction has changed (specifically on the neck)

My beard grows upwards on either side of my throat until it suddenly changes to the opposite direction. For me this is literally an abrupt change on my neck. With lather on my face, I can't see the beard be beneath and therefore have to rely on memory from studying my beard before, but mostly have to listen to the razor. It'll make a very different noise when cutting with as opposed to against or even across the grain.

So that's my advice and as always, your mileage may vary!

**EDIT** 8.) As Han Solo says to Luke when he successfully shoots down a TIE fighter, so I say to fellow new shavers who have had a good couple shaves: Great, kid! Now don't get cocky.

My first two shaves were incredible. No irritation, no nothing. So I thought ""hey, maybe my face isnt as much of a sissy as I thought!"" So for my third shave, i went against everything I listed here (not showering first, pasty and thin lather etc) and boy did i destroy my face. It seemed that I'd lucky not to have both physical and emotional scars from it for the rest of my life. Confidence should be based on a LONG history of good shaves, which, two shaves, does not qualify as. Pay as much attention on every shave as you did for your best, and most careful shave."	t5_2s46m	True

Her grandfather was a US Navy lifer, fought in WWII like a real man. Now, he has prostate cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's. Most of the time, my mother-in-law just does his shaves with a Mach 3 and some Barbasol, so for his birthday shave I offered to do the honors with my kit. So I packed up my Dovo and silvertip brush, some Art of Shaving soap and my bottle of Ogallala Bay Rum and headed over to their house. I swore on my mother's life I wouldn't cut him. It took me about 35 minutes to do everything, and it was kind of difficult to stretch his skin just right to get the proper passes. All in all, I only did once with the grain and once across. After we were done, my mother-in-law was in tears and Grandpa told me some stories about how he used to go to barbershops and have a smoke and get a shave. It was truly a wonderful experience. Of course, I couldn't have done it without you fine gentleman. Does anyone have any good stories about how a simple shave changed somebodies life? I know mine has. "	t5_2s46m	True

1370202024.0	1fj93a	Wicked Edge on straight razor shaving and encouraging new shavers.	commiecat	121	12	108	"I've been wanting to discuss some things about straight razor shaving for a while with this sub.  I'm a straight razor shaver and I think most of us regulars who use straight razors all know each other in this sub and in other shaving communities.  We are a smaller group than the DE shavers and I think we can/should take some steps to help grow the straight razor numbers.

First, in practically every thread inquiring about straight razor shaving there is someone suggesting to use a DE instead.  Even more bothersome is when the person suggesting a DE has *never used a straight razor* themselves.  Some things that typically support these comments:

* *""You should use a DE first""*:  A DE is not a prerequisite to straight razor shaving and there's really nothing in DE shaving technique that translates to straight razor shaving.  You need to learn how to use an open blade no matter if you're coming from cartridges or safety razors.

* *""Straight razors are expensive""*: Good starter kits can be found at affordable prices, and expense is relative.  If someone has a $30 budget then that might be tricky, but if someone says that they're looking at a good $150 startup kit then that's what they should get and suggesting a less-expensive DE kit isn't comparable.

* *""Straight razors are dangerous""*: All razors are equally dangerous and I challenge anyone to show evidence that straight razor users get more cuts than DE users, because I'm fairly certain I've seen more of the latter.  Plus, straight razor cuts make for better stories.  

* *""Straight razors are hard to learn""*: If you start out with a proper blade and do a little bit of reading, then you should be able to get a presentable shave after just a few tries.  Most problems are attributed to poor blades or reading about technique after trying.  Before DEs existed, young men had to learn to shave with straight razors and it seems they managed just fine.

* *""You'll ruin your first strop""*:  Strops get nicks in them, but that *rarely* ruins them.  Good strops have proper mounting hardware and many of them are designed so that the usable strip of leather can be replaced.  

* *""Straight razors are out of stock""*: Dovo has had some supply issues, but they are far from the only razors available.  I usually list 5 - 7 different sites to find straight razors, many of which can be bought today.  Antiques are quite abundant.

Another thing we can work on is helping our new straight razor members.  When someone is having trouble with those first few shaves, I'll see some canned responses with links to previous posts and PDF articles.  The **first thing** we need to know is what type of razor they have and where they bought it from.  If the blade is of questionable steel or if it hasn't been honed by someone reputable, then all those articles on shaving technique will lead to further frustration if the OP keeps trying with a poor edge.  From there, those of us experienced straight razor users can point the OP in the right direction to help them along.

Lastly, about Larry's stuff and how it's often recommended.  I know I'm in the minority about this, but I think you'd see my opinions shared by most people who have been using, collecting, and restoring straights for more than a year.

I would never encourage anybody to buy a razor without seeing it first.  The money you're saving isn't because someone didn't have to ""take time to post the pictures"", it's because not many people would pay for some of the razors that are sold unseen.  I've seen some gems and I've also seen some razors that should *never* have been sold to begin with ([ex.](http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/15fb80/new_straight_razor/)); furthermore, we've had several follow-up threads to the effect of ""How do I clean my sight unseen razor?""  If you want to promote Larry then please suggest paying a little bit more to see the razor before buying.

My second comment is about what ""cosmetic flaw"" means.  To me, that strictly means some patina on the blade or maybe someone's initials scratched into the scales.  Hone wear, loose/tight pivot, uneven edge, and active rust are all *functional* flaws, and the majority of unseen razors have at least one of those attributes.  

There are other vendors who sell restored antiques at affordable prices, and they all post plenty of pictures online so that you can see exactly what you're paying for.  When someone asks about a good Dovo kit then we shouldn't dissuade them and instead suggest some unknown razor.  The Dovo will make for a much nicer razor and in the unlikely event that the person doesn't like straight razor shaving then they'll probably recover more of their start-up price selling the Dovo than the unknown.

**TL;DR**: A lot of info about straight razor shaving given by people who've never used a straight razor, and a discouraging amount of posts suggesting that prospective straight razor users should opt for DE instead.  

Straight razors give the best shave.  As a community we should encourage people to strive for their best shave with the tools that they want.  If someone starts out properly and does a little bit of reading then they can pick up straight razor shaving relatively quickly.

EDIT: Since many people are hung up on my TLDR about ""the best shave"", I mean *none better*.  That does not mean there cannot be equals and we can chat the semantics til the cows come home about it.  Consider your best shave as a pinnacle: under ideal circumstances (sharp edge, skilled hands) you'll reach that pinnacle with a SR.  You might also reach that pinnacle with a DE, or with a cartridge, or with your Bowie knife, but the SR will be the constant as you get full control of the edge sharpness and shaving angle.  Getting those ideal circumstances is what takes much more patience, and to me that was part of the enjoyment of learning."	t5_2s46m	True

As the Mod I try hard to not get involved unless I have no choice and it's for the good of the community as a whole that I need to intercede. I didn't move as fast as some would have liked today as I wanted to allow both sides a public forum to state their sides of the story.

While this did happen there were a few individuals who decided that shall we say ""behavior not becoming a member of wicked_edge"" was the order of the day.  These individuals have been removed from our community, as have the offending threads. I'm sure the hate mail is on its way as I type.

We lost 4 members today because someone decided to bring a personal issue up as a public one. I'm sickened that I had to do this, I really didn't think it would get this far out of control. Like cancer it can spread and I've cut out the offending parts that I know about and can see.

I need you all to help me going forward. There are 3 items I need you to use when needed. 

#1. Downvote: Asshole/ignorant/douchebag comments get the downarrow. Not ones you don't agree with, debate those - it's fun and educational as long as you keep it civil.
#2. Report: Hit the ""report"" link under any submission or comment that you see that violates the 3 rules. (see below). This immediately flags them for my attention.
#3. Message: To the right there is a ""Message the Moderators"" link. That's a separate mailbox that goes directly to me and lets me know of trouble. Think of it as the bat signal - not a toy, but damn handy if the joker is on the loose.

That brings me to the somewhat known  (but should be blindingly obvious) rules of wicked_edge

#1. Thou shall not be a dick
#2. Thou shall not be a spammer
#3. Thou shall not be a recruiter for other forums.

2. To clarify, spamming is not being a contributor regularly and only putting up links to a store/product/whatever. If you are enthusiastic about a new product and want to share you aren't going to get flack.

3. You can recommend other forums (sharpoligist, B&amp;B, SRP) to others, but don't let it be your only answer to a question. I'm not kidding we actually had ""You need to go to {REDACTED} and ask your question to get a good answer"" as a response to a post.

 
To those who were appalled at the posts today please accept my sincere apology for what you read - I hoped that it would self correct more than it did and I know it cost us subscribers above the ones who were banned today. In trying to be fair I allowed this to go longer than it should have hoping that decency and sanity would prevail but sadly the result was exactly what I tried to avoid. 

I don't repeat mistakes - I promise you all that this will not happen again.

Your humble mod

Betelgeux.

EDIT: The response and support you all have provided either in here or via PM have shown your character /r/Wicked_edge - I couldn't be more honored to be your mod than I am at this moment. The actions of a few do NOT reflect on the majority and your honor is apparent in both the response I received in the eye of the storm and after the fact. 
Other Mods have commented that it's a thankless job, that's not the case here. The majority of you care about the quality of the submissions and post replies here. 

I'm by choice the single Mod here and its mostly because you all make it so easy. It's a little /r/circlejerk but you all make it what it is - almost no post or comment gets turfed because there is almost no need to deny it. 

The rage you demonstrated against the issue and the childish comments by way of PM's, Mod emails, downvotes and reports made me realize that being the Mod here was different and worthwhile. 18, that's the TOTAL comments and submissions that I've had to turf since we started 15 months ago. 

Thanks for reminding me that the few are not the whole and we are better than this. I remain your loyal mod

Thanks,

First Straight Razor Shave


Shaving with a straight razor is one of life’s great pleasures. Once you become proficient you can enjoy the closest and most comfortable shaves you have ever experienced. You will actually find yourself looking forward to shaving every day instead of considering shaving a chore.

Shaving with a straight razor should be considered an “Art” and like all arts, there is a slight learning curve that will help you develop the skills necessary to become proficient. It is not recommended that you simply purchase a straight razor, lather up and take on an entire shave on your first experience. Patience is a real virtue here. No matter how many years you have been shaving and how familiar you feel you are with your face, shaving with the straight razor will give you an entirely new perspective of the process.

Let’s take a few minutes and explore some basic concepts that will help you get started.

Get to know the feel of your razor. This may seem a very simple task and one not worthy of mention, but it is really of great importance. Every razor has its own feel and balance. Different blade width’s have different weights as do different handle materials. You should open and close the razor carefully several times to become accustomed to it. You should experiment with different grips in order to find the one that will work best for you when shaving. A standard grip is recommended, however you should determine this based on your own abilities and what you feel will work the best for you. You may find that you will use several different grips when shaving against the grain or across the grain. If a grip does not feel comfortable, don’t try to shave with it. The grip should also be firm for shaving. You do not want to squeeze the razor tightly or hold it loosely in your hand. A comfortable feel is what you are looking for.

In addition to a comfortable feel the proper angle for cutting hair/whisker with a straight razor is usually 30 degrees or less. This may seem very straight forward, but it is the single largest nemesis in obtaining a comfortable straight razor shave. The tendency for most people is to allow the razor to flatten out to an angle of 45 degrees or more and particularly around the chin, flatten the angle out to as much as 90 degrees. Typically this is what causes the scraping and pulling sensation that is most uncomfortable along with not properly removing all the hair/whisker.

Start with a razor that has been professionally honed. What this means is that the razor you intend to shave with should be shave ready. A shave ready razor is one that has been professionally honed and tested to ensure it will shave. In most circumstances your razor will be packed in some type of oil and will have been stropped prior to you receiving it. You will need to rinse the oil off the razor prior to use. You may have been told that stropping prior to shaving with a new razor is not necessary. It may not be, but would be recommended after the oil coating is removed. A disposable blade straight razor would be considered shave ready.

Stropping your razor should consist of 30-50 strokes on a leather strop prior to shaving. The spine of the razor should lead on all strokes with the strop. This means also that the edge of the razor should be trailing. The stroke should be very even in both directions with minimal pressure on the strop. Both the spine and the edge should remain on the strop throughout the stroke. Do not turn the razor over when you change the stroke direction by rolling the razor on its edge. The razor should only be rolled on its spine to prevent damage to both your strop and razor. It is also important to make sure you do not lift the razor up at the end of a stroke in either direction as you may end up dulling the edge of the razor or damaging your strop.

Beard preparation is also a very important aspect to consider prior to your first straight razor shave. Many people shave after they come out of the shower to ensure that the beard is clean and prepared for soaping prior to the shave. Some people still utilize a hot towel over the face before shaving cream, with shaving cream and then after the shave too. The important thing after cleaning the face and beard is to use a good lasting soap or cream that does not dry on the face quickly. A boars hair or badger brush with a nice shaving soap or cream will go a long way to building a nice lather and working the lather into the face, preparing the beard for the shave.

We are now ready to start to learn how to shave with the straight razor. The anticipation of most people and the expectation of the greatest shave you ever had in your life makes what you will read next very important. It is NOT recommended that you try to shave your entire face the first time you shave with a straight razor. What you learn next and the time you devote to learning it, will help to make straight razor shaving a lifelong passion for you. Once learned properly, you will find yourself feeling your face all day long as you become addicted to that baby butt smooth feeling.

Your first day shaving with the straight razor should involve a with the grain (WTG) or stroke from your sideburn down to the jaw on the side of your dominant hand. This is where you want to remember that 30 degree angle or less. Very little pressure should be utilized. Be relaxed. Short strokes of approximately one inch should be utilized down to the jaw line and then several little longer strokes can be used to go back and clean up any remaining hair/whisker in this area. Once you have accomplished this, go ahead and use your regular method of shaving for the rest of that shave.

On day two, so long as you were comfortable with what you did on day one, you will repeat what you did on the dominant hand side, using the dominant hand, but you now can add the cheek area on that side from where the beard starts and shave WTG down to the jaw line above the neck. The real key is to get comfortable with the razor and determine how the cutting angle feels for you and then develop a comfort level with the actual shaving by working through sections of your face rather than tackling the whole face at one time. There are many different angles involved in shaving your face and the more you get comfortable with the razor and these angles the easier it will be to develop the necessary techniques to shave the chin and try across the grain (XTG) or against the grain strokes(ATG) should you desire without nicking or cutting your face up along the journey. Always remember, if something doesn’t feel right or you feel a pulling or tugging that you should not, STOP! It is much easier to take a step back and sort it out prior to a nick or discomfort.

Now, if these first couple days are going your way the next step will be to add the section of your beard from the jaw line and chin line on that dominant side down to where the beard stops on the neck. Again for now, this will be a downward or with the grain stroke.

The next step will be really fun for most of you. We are now going to start shaving the other side of the face. The fun part here though, will be that you will be learning to use your non dominant hand for that side of the face. Yes you can reach across and continue to learn using your dominant hand, but that does impede your vision a little and in the end you will find that learning to use your non dominant hand will make the overall process much easier for you. Once again, before you get started here, you really want to get used to how the razor feels in the non dominant hand and how the grip feels. This may take a day or two, but it is worth the effort. Once comfortable, with the holding the razor in the non dominant hand, only take on the opposite side of the face from the sideburn to the jaw line again and that’s it for that day. Again, once you are comfortable with shaving this area, you can move to the cheek and neck on the non dominant side over the next couple days using the non dominant hand.

Finally, once you are getting comfortable with shaving your entire face WTG and using both hands and getting nice close shaves you are ready to take on the chin. One thing that you can always count on is that every chin is unique in size and structure. In addition, this is usually the heaviest part of the beard for us. I have always found that the chin is really an area to spend a few days on just learning the best angles for shaving it. I recommend breaking the chin down into three areas. Under the lower lip, the sides of the chin and the chin itself. The chin usually will only need a WTG stroke for that BBS feeling although some people will go back and use an XTG stroke for the chin and chin sides.

The time you have spent up to this point has served to lay a foundation for successful and enjoyable straight razor shaving for the rest of your life. From here you can experiment and decide whether you want to try XTG strokes from each ear to the chin on each side of the face and ATG strokes from the lower part of the neck to the chin line. Remember to use both hands. You should also work with your face to stretch the skin in directions that will pick up those areas where the hair may grow in unconventional directions, like the side of the neck.

Many times a really smooth shave is accomplished with only two full passes and some touch up work. Some people do use three full passes, but you should use caution with this. Multiple passes on any part of the face can cause abrasions to that area.

Like every other aspect of wet shaving and straight razor shaving, you will find that there is much room for personal preference here. These helpful hints are not meant to be the end all instructions or guidelines, but simply and easy way to get started minimizing discomfort.

It is not uncommon for the face to be a little dry or red as it gets use to the straight razor for the first couple days. A nice aftershave balm should feel great."	t5_2s46m	True

1370875039.0	1g1obw	The Reddit Shave Brush, on sale now. With the backstory.	justateburrito	127	21	65	"The project started around [4 months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/17q7tc/bb_tsnthey_have_their_own_brushes_why_dont_we/) when I was wondering why all the shave forums have their own customized brushes and we don't. 

I had no intention of trying to get this off the ground, I was just throwing the idea out there.  It seemed like there was some interest so I did some searching and found that Gifts &amp; Care is a company that does a lot of work with Vie Long and they've made custom brushes for other forums.  Being that I'd already dealt with this company I figured it'd be easiest to try them first, [and they were receptive](http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/17u0ww/update_wicked_edge_2013_shave_brush/).

It moved along slowly and then 2 months ago, I was told we needed to [come up with a logo](http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/1brck4/reddit_shave_brush_needs_help_from_a_graphic/), a few people stepped up and /u/element33  had a few options that we sort of polled everyone and decided on.

About a month ago we had a prototype and had to wait for reddit's approval on the design.  Then there was some issues with setting up Gifts &amp; Care(based in spain) to sell on the [reddit store](http://redditgifts.com/marketplace/product/vie-long-horse-badget-shaving-brush/9199/) since they've never set up a merchant based outside of the United States.

The horse/badger mix with a 24mm knot set at 50mm was the majority vote when we polled the community.  Gifts &amp; Care pays 25% of the sales to reddit for licensing the snoo.  The brush is sold on their website for a couple dollars more without the logo, but since so many people showed interest he tried to discount it figuring he'd make up the difference in volume(even after his 25% payout).

**I wanted to clarify:** I am in no way affiliated with Gifts &amp; Care, nor am I receiving any compensation for this.  I had the idea, and decided to run with it.  I ordered my brush Saturday morning when I was told it was available from the regular [reddit store](http://redditgifts.com/marketplace/product/vie-long-horse-badget-shaving-brush/9199/) link and paid the same price as everyone else.

[The Brush is Available Here](http://redditgifts.com/marketplace/product/vie-long-horse-badget-shaving-brush/9199/).  Hope you all enjoy!

**If you think that a consensus has been reached on a product as being bad, list it here.**

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


**Soap/Cream:**

1: Shea Moisture Shave Cream. Why:  [It's non-lathering, so while it may work, it's not to be used with the brush they sell it with](http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/h1lpm/has_anyone_used_shea_butter_shave_soap_i_tried_it/). Suggested Alternatives: Kiss My Face brand shaving cream.


**Brushes:**

1. *CONSENSUS NOT REACHED*  Tweezerman Badger Brush.  [It has a reputation for the knot falling out.](http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/pex0v/i_thought_monday_was_over/)  This means that the badger hair all falls out as one unit, and needs to be re-glued into the handle. Some people don't experience this, some do.  Other than that, it's a good deal for a badger brush.

**Razors (DE):** Suggested Alternatives not offered, just get something that's been recommended on W_E.  Most likely a Wilkinson Sword Classic or a Lord L6.

1. Phatty. [Just, no.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IdT_PObvRc&amp;list=UUvp1J0Tweo54mcV2dNfkpRw&amp;index=6&amp;feature=plcp)

2. Supermax plastic razor.  I didn't even try it.  When I finally got a blade in it, it warped at the edges so much that it was too dangerous and uneven to bother even for sport.

3. [These.](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Men-Double-Edge-Blade-Gold-Tone-Safety-Razor-w-Case-/220945928513?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item3371675141#ht_1719wt_1396)  I bought a dozen of them just for the handles.  I paid $18 for 12 of them.  They are almost unusable, mostly because the baseplate/guard piece is so thin that it could bend in use.  The corners are very sharp.

4. *CONSENSUS*  Parker DE razors have had [Quality Control issues in the past](http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/osyki/getting_bad_shaves_with_your_parker_razor_it/).  Multiple people have indicated that they have corrected these issues, so new stock should be fine.  I have read (B&amp;B) that the Parker DE razors that were not flawed in manufacture were great shavers.  


**Razors (Straight):**

1. *Consensus reached* [Vintagestraightrazor.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/pmbb0/unofficial_wicked_edge_do_not_buy_list/c3qit8p)

2. Cheap pakistani/chinese straight razors.  They aren't made with good steel, and as such, won't shave well.  Here's a list of names they often use: Kreigar, Sweeney Todd, Smith and Wesson, Double Arrow, Enzo England, GB Buckingham, Angel of death, Schrade, Walden, and Crowing Rooster.  They will sometimes say just: ""Straight Folding Razor"", ""German style straight razor knife"" or ""Spring assist"".  There is a lot of discussion on other forums about ""Gold Dollar"" razors, and whether they can be modified or honed into acceptable condition for shaving.  As far as I can tell, the verdict is still out.  The same may apply to Double Arrow, though it was only mentioned once.  Some of the above names are actually for companies that make knives, and may be reputable as knife makers. It should be noted that the razors you see with those particular names (Schrade, Smith and Wesson) are probably not actually made by the same companies that make knives.

I spent the next couple of weeks being Wetshaving's answer to Towlie from South Park. Just the mention of a razor and I appeared. Once we passed about 500 users I slowed down on the promotion messages because I figured that that was likely nearing the top of what we'd get for subscribers.

Since then we've grown to almost 4000 users and over 100,000 hits a month. http://redditlist.com/stats/wicked_edge puts us at 543 out of 56,507 for size and 403 in overall activity.

I'm floored. I never expected this to get this big and the even more impressive thing is there is actually very little work I need to do as a mod. Spam is nil (the filter traps one legit post from time to time). I almost never bust out the [M] tag because for the most part you all make it unnecessary.

We've got a ton of experience and even the newer users are comfortable in offering advice to others. I couldn't have asked for a better group.

I may have started this place but you all have turned it into the community it is.

Thank you all.

1341345225.0	vztl9	10 Stratagies For A Better Shave On The Neck	mantic59	126	29	21	"The neck can be a particularly troublesome area to shave.  Some just can't seem to get a close enough shave.  Others are troubled by shave burn with redness and pain, nicks, cuts, and ingrown hairs.  Here are 10 strategies that can help tame the neck:


**1. Detailed Grain Mapping**

The ""grain"" of the beard--the direction(s) the hairs grow in--can be completely counter-intuitive when it comes to the neck.  They can even sometimes grow in a circular pattern.  Understanding how the hair grows on your neck is the first step in overcoming shaving problems there.  You can find grain mapping aids on Sharpologist.com (and I have added them to this newsletter too).  Shaving with the grain initially is one of the basic concepts in shaving, particularly important if you are using a multi-blade cartridge razor.  It's a bit less important with a DE (you can ""cheat"" a little and follow the predominant direction without worrying about every twist and turn) but still necessary to keep in mind.  Reducing the beard in stages is the key take-away here.


**2. Careful Preparation**

Properly preparing the skin of the neck is often overlooked: copious amounts of hot water or gently cleaning the skin on the face often overlooks the neck.  Pay attention and be sure that warm towel or ""barbershop prep"" lather covers the neck!


**3. Pre-shave Oil**

I'm not a big fan of pre-shave oils but some have found that applying some on the neck helps reduce irritation.


**4. Use Cold Water To Shave**

Consider, after a normal prep, using cold water to shave with.  Some shavers have reported a significant reduction in irritation with cold water shaving.


**5. Use A ""Gentle"" Razor With A High-Performance Blade**
This might be tougher to do with a cartridge razor since alternative blade sources may not be available but in the case of cartridge razors it's probably safe to say that fewer blades will yield less irritation.  However that is not ""etched in stone"" so some experimentation may be necessary.  For DE razor users this might seem counter-intuitive as well but a ""gentle"" razor with a small safety bar gap (Merkur Classic, Weishi, many of the vintage Gillette Superspeeds) will expose less blade to the skin.  A high-performance blade (like a Feather) can then cut more ""efficiently,"" reducing the chance for irritation.


**6. Use An Adjustable DE Razor**

Although there are not many choices (Merkur Progress/Futur/Vision or a vintage adjustable), using an adjustable razor can ""tailor"" the shave.  Dial down for a milder shave on the neck, dial up for other parts of the beard if necessary.


**7. Flattening--Not Over-Stretching--The Skin**

Let's face it, the neck is not a flat area; it's a terrain of curves and odd angles.  Many shavers will tilt their head upward to pull the skin of the neck taut.  This may help but it doesn't really flatten the area.  Instead, try leaning forward and tilting the head back SLIGHTLY.  Shorter strokes on the razor may also help cover flatter areas more consistantly.


**8. Use No Pressure On The Razor**

No pressure means NO PRESSURE!


**9. Try Some ""Advanced"" Shaving Tricks On Small Areas**

This is not for everyone but if you have small areas of stubble or rough patches you can try some techniques like ""J-Hooking"" or ""Blade Buffing"" to cover those areas without re-shaving--and possibly getting irritation--over a wider area.  However over-doing these advanced techniques can be a prescription for trouble if not done carefully and judiciously.


**10. Settle For Less**

Do you really need that ""baby's butt smooth"" neck?  Maybe it's time to skip that third pass and just go for looking presentable.

The stories, insight, community and dedication about shaving convinced me almost instantly to try it out. As so many of you, I also only enjoyed one part of my old cartridge shaving: Finishing it. [I'm so glad to be rid of it.](http://i.imgur.com/XrAk66H.jpg)

It didn't take long before I ordered my [first DE kit](http://i.imgur.com/yduPaXf.jpg). With close to no knowledge and certainly with rubbish technique, I was amazed of the result. Just WOW! After using electric razors and the x/y/z-blades Gillettes for 15 years, that shave beat it all. 

That very moment, I knew I had to introduce old school shaving to my closest male family members (my father, father-in-law and brother-in-law). I got three user grade razors via /r/Shave_Bazaar for a very modest price from /u/nashrome. So when my brother-in-law was visiting last week, I got him an [inexpensive Van der Hagen shaving set](http://www.amazon.com/Van-Hagen-Mens-Luxury-Shave/dp/B004L4EING/ref=sr_1_3?ie) (20 bucks on Target) and [this razor](http://imgur.com/a/JeA5B).

The reaction was beyond my wildest expectations. He looked at the 40's-50's Gillette Super Speed, carefully felt the weight, shape and tried the TTO-mechanics. He felt the quality of the metal, and probably realized that this piece of craftsmanship aged close to 70 years easily would beat the &gt;$250 dollar electric razor he got last Christmas (which he doesn't even use due to giving a bad shave). With a tear in his eyes, he looks at me and says: ""This is the nicest thing anyone has given me in many years"". 

While this isn't true in any monetary means (hello, $250 electric razor), he *sincerely meant* that the $10 razor alone was the nicest *item* he had received in years. His fiancee, seated next to him, wasn't even surprised by his statement, she just nodded confirmingly.

I felt such a happiness, both from his emotional reaction, his kind words, and the fact that I surely would feel the same way. 

I can't wait to hand out the two other razors.

The text reads:
Grip brush between thumb and forefinger, rest middle finger on brush and allow ring finger to support brush on bottom side of shaft.  Use a swirling, circular motion emanating from wrist to create a thick, foamy, rich lather after adding hot water to vessel to soften soap.

OK, now that silliness is out of the way.  But, I did want to share a simple concoction that has really helped whenever I get razor burn.  Here is what you need:

1.  Rubbing alcohol (Isopropyl)
2.  8 Aspirin (Uncoated)
3.  [2 oz. Spray Bottle](http://i.imgur.com/HMQK3tE.jpg)

You can probably figure out what to do from just from the ingredients.  But, pour 2 oz. of alcohol into the spray bottle.  Crush up the aspirin, and add them to the bottle.  Shake until it is dissolved.  Then, just spray it on your razor burn.

You can add a very tiny amount of a scented oil, if you prefer.  But, I'm not a big fan of those.

All of these items can be purchased for around $1 each.  So, you're looking at a grand total of $3 for this miracle cure."	t5_2s46m	True

1363963577.0	1asu6x	A girl's findings of her double edge shaving experiment	Jaqacake	105	17	30	"I guess this is kinda my 'review' of my experience so far, mostly I guess it would be helpful for other girls thinking of changing but I'm not sure where would be a more useful place to post it (you know, for fellow girls googling for advice on the subject of being a girl and using a DE razor).  I am also very happy to receive advice!

I've been doing it for a couple of months, using cheapo equipment (basic DE razor from boots including a pack of blades, ~£6, palmolive shave stick ~75p, brush from chemist ~£5) in fear of shelling out and finding I just couldn't get on with it.  I've now decided my experiment has paid off and invested in some better kit, which I'm hoping will make things even better as the blades I've been using really could be sharper.

**What's my hair like?**

I'm not especially hairy, although the hair I do have is dark and very thick.  I've had some IPL on my legs and it's a little sparser and lighter as a result there.

**Why did I try switching to DE shaving?**

Primarily because I like to shave my lady bits.  The problem I've always had though was irritation, shaving once a week was about as much as I could manage and even then the area would remain looking awful, any more often and it would seem to break out in spots or something (?) and usually bleed.  I always had problems with ingrown hairs.  Using a brand new cartridge left it in a slightly better state although still with a bit of a rash and the costs of cartridges is prohibitive.

My initial set up, described above, was cheaper than buying a new pack of cartridges which I was in need off, so I decided to spend the money trying something different instead.

**How do my experiences with DE shaving compare to cartridge razors?**

Previously I used a gillette venus with 5 blades.  So I guess a single pass with that is dragging 5 blades across my skin as opposed to one blade with the DE.

**Legs**: not much difference, I shave my legs exactly the same, one pass from ankle to knee going round, then a couple of extra passes where I seem to have missed.  It does take longer to lather up properly rather than just shave using my body wash.  I haven't tried just using the body wash with the DE razor (mostly because it's still novel to use a brush and it doesn't really take that long).

Now reading the information on this forum I'm apparently supposed to do lots of little strokes, I just shaved as I did before and haven't had a problem.

**Underarms**: Improvement, I probably do about 4 passes in different directions, as opposed to 2-3 I did with a cartridge, although it doesn't take much longer and takes about as long to lather up properly on my underarms as I used to take with body wash (between passes I can lather it back up in seconds with one hand while rinsing off the razor with the other).  The improvement is that I now have no irritation, my underarms look a lot closer to those in a dove deodorant commercial than before (when there was always a bit of a rash).  Ingrown hairs were rare here but I haven't had any since.  I previously and still do shave my underarms every time I shower.

**Pubic region**: This is where the difference is really noticeable.  Here I do the most passes, as I did with a cartridge, probably not any more than I used to, it wouldn't surprise me if some areas are gone over 10 times though.  I still have some redness although I've now bought some blade sample packs and I'm hoping this will improve matters over the boots blades I got with the cheapo razor.  I haven't had any ingrown hairs since (although not sure why a razor would make a difference?) and any irritation fades much quicker - I can shave every day without problem and overall the area has a better appearance, although mostly I don't do it every day because it still takes a while and I can't be bothered in the shower.

**What about cutting yourself?**

I've only cut myself once, on my knee on my very first pass when I pressed down far too hard and had also extended beyond where I'd lathered.  The same place I frequently cut myself using cartridge razors.

Although normally, due to the irritation or something if I tried to shave my pubic region within 3 or 4 days after the last shave I would usually end up with it bleeding all over, this is no longer the case.

Aside from that, I normally cut myself about once a month using cartridge razors, maybe after I've been using DE razors for about a year I'll be in a better position to say if I cut myself any more of less.

However it is worth noting that I don't think the blades I've been using so far - the ones which came with the cheapo razor - are particularly sharp, I've ordered some new and hopefully better blades now so maybe cutting will become a greater risk.

**Overall opinion?**

Much better, although slower and more faff.  I'm a convert and have now ordered a nicer razor as well as sample packs of blades and some posher soap, I'm feeling a bit poor holding on upgrading the brush for now.

Leaving allowance to buy more blades and soap for the rest of the year I expect my costs of buying both razors and everything else for to be a little higher than what I'd usually spend on cartridges in a year but significantly lower than if I replaced the cartridge as often as I'd like.  Importantly though it doesn't feel as much of a 'waste' and begrudged spend as buying new cartridges do though, and I get a much better shave and less irritation in the meantime as a result.

I'd just like to persuade my boyfriend that he should give it a try.  He doesn't like wet shaving because of the irritation, but using his electric razor just leaves his face feeling a little like sandpaper (which is a problem for me, rather than him).

**Update that no-one will see**

My new razor arrived and tried a shave with that, better blade and new better soap and wow, it's so much better!  My review above was based on the crappy stuff I bought initially, and I can safely say buying better equipment is well worth it, best shave ever and you can't even feel it (beyond something gliding smoothly across your skin anyway).  I finally understand it when a bloke says they enjoy their morning shave."	t5_2s46m	True

My recipe (single small batch):
4oz Vodka
2oz Rum (I used Mount Gay, because it had a very ""Rum"" scent, but avoided high Molasses/Dark rums because they dried ""sticky"" when I tested them)
1/4 Tbsp Crushed allspice (Buy the whole allspice and smash it...the scent is better)
1/8 Tbsp Crushed black pepper (Buy the whole peppercorn and smash it...the scent is better)
Zest from one lime
1-2 Cinnamon sticks
6-8 Drops Bay Essential Oil

I put it all in a mason jar and let it sit in a dark cupboard for five days, giving it a swirl once a day.  After the five days, I rubber banded a few coffee filters to a measuring cup and filtered out all the particles. I then added a few drops of water to the mix to thin the alcohol a little.  It is now a perfect golden color.

I then picked up a small Oil Cruet from Target for $1.00 and bottled it.  According to the wife, it has the smell of the commercial brands I have tried, but less harsh, more subtle and much cleaner. She loved it, which is what matters.

Based on my experience and what you have around the house, this bottle of Bay Rum ran me about $1.75 (including the bottle) as I had everything but the Bay Oil in the house and the bottle...The oil was about $8 on Amazon, but you use so little per batch it will last forever.

For about five minutes of time, I would highly recommend this to any WE folks as the smell is so much better than pre made options and you save a ton, while earning a do-it-yourselfer manly badge.

On March first I experienced the biggest pain I ever felt in the whole twenty five years I've been living. I was working from 10:30 am to 6:15 pm, not having a car when I got done working I decided to go to the store to buy some stuff to repair my truck while waiting for my roommate to finish working since he offered to pick me up after work. I bought the cables I needed and some electrical tape and started waiting outside the store when my cellphone rang, the phone number was from my parent's house, I said to myself ""Hey, it's been a while, I meant to call them but forgot."" And then, I answered the phone...

""Mathieu"", it was my mother

""Hey, how are you mom?"" her voice seemed weird...

""Your father left a suicide note on the table!"" At this point the whole world just crumbled under me but I managed to stay calm.

""Ok, did you call the police?"", yes she did, she then passed the phone to the officer that was with her at the time, he explained to me that in his letter my father was talking about a cliff along a path where we went snowshoeing together once last year, I managed to explain how to reach the begining of the path and told him I was coming as fast as I could.

I then called my roommate and told him ""Get the fuck here as soon as you can, my father left a suicide note at home, we're picking our girlfriends at our place and going there right away."" I then called my girlfriend to tell her to get ready to go out ASAP. On my way there I managed to reach my brother who just finished working, he lives three hours away, I told him that if there was a time when he needed to come back home it was right now.

When we reached my parent's house I made some food and I tried to comfort my mother as best as I could while trying to get as much information from the officer as I could get. The waiting game started. My father went deep inside the woods, maybe an hour and a half of walking, the officer that went looking for him didn't have snowshoes at first, which slowed him down a lot, in the end we were there for three hours, waiting...

Finally, the officer who stayed with us came back inside the house.

""They found Paul."" he said, ""Sadly, he is dead.""

At this point, nothing existed but anger, sadness and pain. My mother and I cried for the next thirty minutes. I called at work telling them I wouldn't be able to be there for the weekend and the next week, when I hung up I punched a hole in a door out of anger. My brother arrived not much later, he was frozen, the heater wasn't working in his car and the temperature was below zero. He went to take a shower I needed some grounding, something to bring me back to Earth and help me think more clearly.

I took my father's shaving kit I had given him just a few weeks earlier and I shared one last thing with him, I shaved using the very last blade he used... This moment I spent focused on a task of precision was all I needed at that point, if it wasn't for that I don't know what I could have done to calm myself.

Right now, two weeks later, I'm feeling kind of lost, I'm spending time with my girlfriend but I can't seem to focus when she's talking to me. I don't sleep very well and I try not to think too much. That last thing is why I want to thank you guys, you kept me busy for two days (had I know I would have made the boxes to ship out my kits in advance!) and those were the first two days where I didn't feel empty inside since my father died.

Words!  They limp so badly when I want my heart to speak clearly.

How can I, and where should I offer my thank you to others?  I want to make it clear to everyone how much we appreciate your help.

First and foremost, the cost. Cartridge razors are insanely expensive, canned shaving foams even more so. Secondly, quality. No arguments that disposable plastic crap doesn’t suck, please - I know I dropped my Gillette-Whatever in the shower and broke it too many times to entertain the notion that those cartridge razors are made to last. As for the quality of the shave, I know I ALWAYS dealt with razor burn and lumps and bumps and rashy red spots, on my legs and other bits. Canned shaving gels and foams do nothing - LESS than nothing, really, since they’re quite drying - to protect your skin and cost a bundle per shave. Thirdly, the environmental impact of disposables. Seriously! Think of all that packaging and waste. So, basically, I wanted a better shaving result that cost less money and wasn’t leaving a ginormous carbon footprint with every shower. The answer: traditional wetshaving!

**To begin, you need four things:** a DE (double-edged) razor, razor blades, a shaving brush, and shaving soap/cream. These things are not created equal, and nobody agrees on what’s best, because everyone has different shaving styles and needs and ends up liking different stuff. Here are some things to consider:

**Your razor:** Most women prefer a longer handle, and many experienced shavers direct females to razors like the antique Lady Gillette or the extremely posh Edwin Jagger Chatsworths. I’ve also seen Lord razors frequently recommended - evidently, they shave well and the cost is attractive to beginners. My thoughts? I bought myself a Parker 84 off eBay for less than $20 with a packet of blades as my first razor. Now, the Parkers get trashed out a lot by menfolk, and probably rightly so, it is NOT an aggressive razor (there are many things that make some razors more aggressive than others - space around the blade edge, angle, etc, but suffice it to say some razors are bitier than others) and is probably frustrating as hell to dudes with extremely tough beards (who should probably be shaving with Merkur Slant Bars, but I digress). My leg hair - heck, my PUBIC hair - is nowhere near that tough to shave, and the Parker 84 is nicely long-handled, it’s pretty, it has a nice grip when wet in the shower, and it’s still one of my favourites now that I’ve collected a few different razors. I have no problem recommending it as a beginner’s razor for that reason. I do have a Lady Gillette, and that thing, I am convinced, is possessed by a demon spirit. It is the bloodthirstiest goddamned razor I have ever used. I keep shaving with it once a week or so out of sheer stubbornness, hoping I figure out the magic angle to make it work well for me, but yeah. Not my favourite!

**Razor blades:** there are about a million choices. My favourites, in order of preference: Number-one-with-a-bullet, Feather platinum coated. These are hands-down the sharpest blades you can buy, and I’ve never used anything that gave me a finer shave. #2, Astra superior platinum. My third favourite are the 7am platinum coated razor blades. What’s with the platinum coating? It makes the blade corrosion resistant, and they last a lot longer in the shower, which if you’re me, is where you’ll probably keep your razor. The whole bathroom’s humid, anyway. What am I NOT recommending? Those terrible Wilkinson Sword blades that they commonly sell at grocery stores and the like. They’re not very sharp (and therefore drag across instead of cut the hair, causing skin irritation, which is one of the very things we are trying to avoid, yes?), they’re about a dollar each at the shops where I live (as opposed to maybe $0.10 - $0.20 each, for better blades bought online), please don’t waste your time. You can get razor blades super cheap off eBay (and any number of other websites!), and lots of sellers do sampler packs if you want to try lots of different types of blades to see what you like best. I’d suggest picking one and going with it for awhile when you’re first working out the finer points of your technique, because you’re not going to be in any position to evaluate your razor blade when you don’t really know how to properly shave yet.

Also, most razor blades are sold in little plastic containers that work as blade safes to safely dispose of your used blades. No sharps container required. You can make a Leisureguy-approved fully-recyclable blade safe out of small evaporated milk can - use a can opener to cut a small slit under the edge, drain the milk out, rinse it thoroughly, pop your used blades into it. Bang the edge down with a hammer when it gets full (in a few years) and recycle the whole shebang. However you choose to go, please don’t just throw your used blades in the rubbish - your friendly local garbage collector doesn’t need a scare like that.

**Shaving brush:** You want something that holds a lot of water to make a decent lather, and there are a lot of guides around telling you what to buy, but please, for the love of Maude, don’t go out and spend a hundred bucks on a super high quality silvertip badger brush for your beginner brush. I say get a basic “pure” or “best” badger brush - mine was $15 at my local pharmacy in the shave aisle - or a good-quality synthetic if you’re non-animal inclined. You are probably not going to notice the difference in delightful lofty softness between a silvertip and a best badger brush when lathering your legs or armpits, and I find lathering easier with a moderately stiffer brush, anyway. I don’t bother with a shaving mug or cup, I lather on my body, which I’ll discuss in a minute.

**Shaving soap:** this differs from regular soap because it creates a richer lather that protects better. I've tried a few, from basic Palmolive Shave Stick (about $2 from my local supermarket and it works a treat) to delightful artisan shaving creams and soaps from various Etsy sellers and shaving websites. My A+ #1 favourite shave cream ever is Corrynne’s Shaving Soap, which has lots of clay in it and protects the skin very well and smells delightful and creates gorgeous rich lather with the merest dab on my brush, and at $20 a tub (that lasts months and months), it’s still cheaper than canned shaving gel. Don't be afraid to experiment to find one you like!

Oh, and this isn’t required as such, but you may also want to pick up an **alum block** as an aftershave skin treatment - I use an alum crystal deodorant, it’s mildly styptic and astringent and helps prevent any irritations and bumps when applied to wet skin post-shave. Lots of people rave about **witch hazel** as an aftershave, too, but I haven’t tried it and I don’t have any dramas just using my alum crystal.

OK, still with me? The rest is EASY!

**Technique:** obviously, your skin needs to be nice and warm and wet to soften the hairs for shaving, so the shower’s just fine. I tend to wash my hair, put conditioner in, and shave while my conditioner’s doing its thing. I point the water away from me so it’s hitting the wall, wet my badger brush, dab it in my shaving cream, and lather one whole leg. If I’m using a hard shaving soap or shave stick, I actually rub it right on my wet skin, then lather it all over with the shaving brush.

Now, two things to remember here, beginners: shave *WITH THE GRAIN* at first and use *SHORT STROKES*. None of those big long sweeping whole-leg against-the-grain strokes we know and love. Also, do not put *ANY PRESSURE ON THE RAZOR WHATSOEVER*. You’ve probably noticed that your new razor is considerably heavier than a plastic disposable, and the blades are ridiculously sharp. Let the weight of the razor do the work. You’re also wanting about a 30 degree angle between the razor and your skin, but that works itself out pretty naturally if you’re taking your time and not rushing. Use extra caution around anklebones and knees. Rinse the razor under the running hot water after every other stroke (flip the razor over to use both sides for two strokes). And when you finish that first pass on the first leg, feel it - it probably feels pretty smooth. I say leave it at that and do the other leg, and we’ll do against the grain strokes in a few days when you start to get the hang of it. If you do decide to do another pass (against the grain or otherwise), *LATHER UP AGAIN*. Your skin will soon get used to the new regime and your technique will improve over time and with practice, and doing multiple passes will not irritate your skin in the future. These days, as a seasoned pro, I shave against the grain in big long strokes, just like I used to, and it takes me no longer to shave than it ever did. If I did that in the beginning, I would've carved myself up like a Virginia ham.

**Underarms**, you ask? Just the same. I actually do mine in about four passes in all directions, re-lathering for each pass. Haven’t had a bump or ingrown hair since I started with DE razors.

**Genital bits?** Yep. You bet. Obviously, be careful, but there’s no reason why not, and again, I get so much less irritation than I used to. It’s a safety razor, not a danger razor, just be careful and you’ll be fine.

When you’re done, rinse your razor thoroughly and hang it or stand it up somewhere outside the direct path of the water to dry (I have a suction-cup wall basket off to the side of my shower that's my dedicated shaving stuff holder). Rinse all of the soap out of your brush, squeeze it gently, and give it a good shake to remove most of the water, then stand it up or hang it to dry. Then, rinse all of your freshly shaven parts in cool water, finish your shower, and when you get out, rub that alum crystal on your still-wet shaven bits. It might sting a little, especially if you’ve nicked yourself, but only for a second, and it will stop the bleeding and prevent bumps. Dry off as normal, moisturise as you will, and go about your day. **You’re awesome!**"	t5_2s46m	True

I had my first DE shave tonight.  Things went horribly, horribly wrong.  First, my lather sucked.  Then, after my first pass I felt like I didn't accomplish anything.  So I decided I needed another in the same direction.  I probably went 3 or 4 times in the same direction, then thought, ""oh yeah XTG.""  Another 3 or 4 passes that way.  Once I was finally (marginally) satisfied, I rinsed off.

Blood.  Blood everywhere.

Shit.  ""Cold water,"" I thought, ""Cold water,"" they said.  Then an alum block.  So much fire on my face.  Aftershave.  Nothing could repair the damage I had done.

In retrospect, I genuinely believe I made every possible mistake.  Too much pressure, a shitty angle, bad lather, too many passes, repeat strokes without relathering, etc.

It was a mess, but I think I learned something in the process.

Goal for next time: don't destroy my face."	t5_2s46m	True

1352418457.0	12vv2y	So I had an affair	JohnnyAppleCreed	130	45	39	"The sun had not broken the horizon when my alarm began to sing its fateful tune. ""Oh shit what happened"" were the words I uttered when it became apparent that I had hit snooze 4 times. I had 15 minutes to shower, shave, pack up, and get to the office. There sitting on my bathroom shelf was my lovely Dubl Duck Dwarf I had lovingly nicknamed Dan. Oh we had been through a lot together, you see Dan was my grandfathers first razor bought back in the 50s. My grandfather gave that razor to me when I turned 16 and I have treated it lovingly since only recently learning to shave with it (about 2 years ago). Every morning Dan and I went on an adventure where the evil facial hair that grew would be cut down with his wicked edge. 

This morning though I had to revert to a bad habit. As I hopped in the shower I grabbed my old disposable razors, and had to let that cursed instrument wreak it's havoc on my jaw, chin, cheeks, and lip. I came out of the shower not much worst for wear but there was Dan, he had seen it all. I could tell he was disappointed with me his scales seemed duller, and his blade was buried just a little bit deeper than before. 

As I closed the door I swear I heard ""how could you"".  "	t5_2s46m	True
