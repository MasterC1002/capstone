Let's not that forget though that creating extract, just like almost everything in life, is a learned skill and thus people will all have varying skill levels. By shitting all over people that post 'bad' extract all you are doing is turning them off from this sub and possibly from extracts in general. There is a definite line between trying to educate people and being an condescending asshole... 

I personally would like to see as many people as possible enjoying the awesomeness of extracts and also this sub. Can we all just relax, take a dab and maybe be a little nicer to the new guys?

Running indoors, using PVC, grinding vs bigger nugs, using a rubber band, not locking down the end caps, whipping pre-purge... there are so many things wrong with this video it is scary to think how a kid wandering over from /r/trees could hurt themselves by attempting it. 

Also, why is the Toke City ""small run technique"" not labeled as BHO? That is an excellent (and safe) guide... ironically, it contains warnings/recommendations that directly conflict with the ""BHO"" video we link to, both safety and technique.

We've all been around and around, debating the right way to extract/purge - only to come to the conclusion that there is no ""one right way"" but surely, we can all agree that this video is a great example of what NOT to do, yes?

I don't know what the perfect tutorial is, maybe we could put it to a vote?

TL:DR - As of now, our most popular concentrate on our front page has no instructions. Why not try to make a single place to show what are the correct instructions to follow/the things you should never do/items you should buy/etc in typed form and add it to the sidebar? Thoughts?

This is a self-post that is supposed to be for the greater good of the community, please upvote for visibility.

As of right now, there is no easy to follow method on making BHO for people who just want to make their product but not know the science behind it. I am the opposite where I like to know the science behind everything before I do it, as I'm sure many of you are, but there are some people who are new into making BHO, and end up not using common sense or follow peoples instructions that could lend them to killing themselves. Also, there is tonnes of incorrect information on major websites regarding BHO. Here is an example of what I think is incorrect information that people tend to eat up because **an Administrator** posted it: http://weedtracker.com/cannabis/topic/193441-differences-between-wax-and-budder/

Now, why am I posting this? Because there are tonnes of smart people in here who know how to make BHO with the least impurities while keeping it the most stable without losing it's flavor, but there isn't a single place to find all that information. After months of lurking, as much as I have an idea of what to do, I still don't really know what is the best way because of peoples opinions. It seems that peoples opinions get the best of them, and use downvote instead of having a real discussion, or they post ""Just stop talking/Don't talk if you don't know what you're talking about"" without guiding that person in the right direction.

So, the reason for this post: I want to do an AMA questionnaire in the same way that R/Drugs does their AMA about Adderall/Mushrooms/DMT/etc. I already contacted one of the moderators and they think it's a good idea. The title would be ""I am ______, AMA"", and I would post the most common questions that seem to get asked on a daily basis and hope that people with years of experience can help post their information about how they make the healthiest HBO. 

Does anyone have any tips I could do to make it better/reasons why this shouldn't be done/any concerns? By the way, the posts wouldn't have any joking around/no insulting/no personal opinions, but experience from users over the years of different ways of making BHO.

I know that the light right behind the oil can make it sort of ""glow"", but the picture is almost always a misrepresentation of the hash, when many times the OP is asking for help or critique. 

I'm not attempting to bitch or complain about people or their hash in any capacity - I'm just trying to let people know the best way to get their hash across. Some pictures don't do the hash justice, while some make it to be something it isn't

Example -This is good shatter, I just accidentally let it get a little too warm when I wasn't paying attention. It is fairly dark - this first pic was taken outside in the full sunlight. The second was taken in front of a lamp 

- http://i.imgur.com/ztwqFRF.jpg

- http://i.imgur.com/SwWuQVA.jpg

From what I see on the front page, there are far too many posts like my second picture. To me, the second picture is kind of fooling you, as the hash isn't really as it appears.

To each his own, this was just my attempt at letting people know that the best way to get a picture of oil is not to put it in front of a light source, but to let the light source illuminate your hash. Sunlight ftw


**Edit** - Despite some possible shitty wording in the OP, this post isn't an attempt to critique or tear down anyone's hash or pictures of said hash. Sorry if it came off as ""your hash sucks and you're trying to trick us with light/ you suck at taking pictures/ duke knows best"". "	t5_2r341	True

I am sure you know, silicone swells in the presence on non-polar solvents. Hexane is actually used as a “swelling agent” for silicone tubing to allow for an easier connection.

The swelling effect is the primary reason why silicone makes a poor compatibility choice when selecting a material to come into prolonged direct contact with non-polars.

As you must also be aware, chemical contamination from “extractables” in silicone materials, (in a procedure such as you are describing) is due almost entirely to the physical release of low molecular weight siloxanes, and other impurities from the manufacturing process.

This is why Tygon 3350, or SaniTech-Ultra, are made with platinum cured silicone rather than the more common peroxide cured variety. This is also why We use platinum catalyzed USP6 silicone in our pads. (rather than peroxide/food grade).

As far as I am aware, we are the ONLY company doing this. The cost of material for a simple “baking mat” would be prohibitive in that industry.

For the record (sometime I feel like a broken record)We do not sell the Pad to spray directly onto. Many (many) folks do, and when we realized it (july of 2012), we switched the silicone we use as our raw material as aprophylactic measure. 

We also removed the Logo from our pads, because we feared that immersion in non-polar solvent could act to weaken the bond between that thin layer of logo silicone, and the pad beneath. As concerned as we were about the logo....i cringe when I see folks spraying into parchment. 

The matrix of silicone in common parchment paper (non-Quilon / silicone coated) is extremely fragile compared to a pad. I imagine the violence of swelling and shrinking on that scale would be tenfold compared to the effect that prompted our own change of material.

The physical wear of swelling/shrinking/swelling/shrinking along with the various stresses inflicted by the innovative public (razor blades, torches etc...) make any sort of performance warranty unmanageable.

So we make em as pure as it gets, and when people ask us....we tell em that if they insist on using them this way, to please discard them if they notice any physical degradation.

I would refrain from cutting the pad to perform your testing, as this will expose the inner weave. Once cut or torn, the physical consequences of swelling could lead to damage along the exposed area.

Let me know where to send it, and I will get a Pad out to you today. Always happy to hear your thoughts. I redacted about 2 pages of hyper technical diatribe from this email.... because I figured you have likely done your own research regarding Pt cured silicone, and the various plasticizers that are used in food grade silicone. This is understandably a topic quite close to my heart; and I will be vary happy to discuss at length should you have specific questions (or non-specific musings?).

Also, should you require it, you have my explicit permission to share anything we discuss with whichever forums you are involved in.

Since I've been on here, I've been purchasing more quality hash than before and I'm more aware of how to make my own when I have the opportunity.  

However, I can't help but notice that this subreddit has a population of trolls and haters greater than other subs.  Considering we're all potheads, I'm kind of surprised at the pettiness.  Here's a pic of what I'm talking about: http://i.imgur.com/oBTTuYj.jpg  

I'm sure you've noticed similar happenings in other posts.  What bugs me, in this particular instance is that Masonir's honest question had so many downvotes, and when OP stepped in to answer the other redditor, he was downvoted as well. 

What the fuck people?  I just don't understand this.  I see so many quality comments receive downvotes in this sub.  Remember, the downvote button is not for things you disagree with, it's for irrelevant comments that don't add to the conversation.  I'm tired of seeing downvotes on good comments.  Please, let's just be a bit more self aware, and less immature.  If someone asks OP something in the comments, don't downvote it and then also downvote the answer.  Is that really the treatment you want when you post?

Finally, I'll end with people who rag on shitty BHO that often gets posted.  One, BHO is relatively novel, so many don't understand the difference between good and bad.  When you comment on their posts and say ""oh this looks like shit,"" you do nothing to educate, increasing the odds of more bad BHO being made/purchased.  

Anyways, apologies for the rant to those that are already good people, but to all the douchebags on this subreddit... get a fucking life and stop hating.  It's all going to come around and bite you in the ass. "	t5_2r341	True

Yesterday, I received word that one of my my family members has cancer.  For years, I have read about people using hash oil to send cancer and other ailments into remission, such as Rick Simpson and others.  What I need is to talk to some people that have used this treatment successfully.  I've done tons of research on it and which form would be best for ingesting, but hearing from someone with first hand experience would mean so much to me and my family.  I hope someone can help and thanks in advance!

**EDIT:  I just want to say thank you to all of you that have been trying to help me out.  It means more to me and my family than you can possibly imagine!**

I have a tolerance and handled the dab fine, but it's just so, *so* overbearing -- I honestly can't imagine doing it more than once a day.

I have seen a few comments around here suggesting that if your metal nail doesn't stick to a magnet ""then you're good"", and those comments receiving numerous upvotes. This is incorrect. I wanted to make this post to say the magnet test is by no means a conclusive test. The magnet test can only exclude certain metals from the list of possibilities, it can not confirm any of them. A magnet can only determine one thing about the metal, whether it is ferrous or non ferrous. If any piece of your nail reacts even slightly to a magnet then the material is ferrous (containing iron) and can therefore be deduced that it is not titanium. If the metal does not react, this does not mean that the nail is titanium, this only means that it is made from a non ferrous metal of which titanium is one possibility. But, this still leaves a list of possibilities including metals like aluminum, lead, nickel, and [many more](http://www.buzzle.com/articles/non-ferrous-metals-list.html). I think the reason this test became so popular was because there were adjustable nails with ""MFG USA GR2"" laser etched onto the side of the heads. These nails had threaded shafts which would react to magnets. I pointed this out in a FB group called Glass Awareness and I have seen it since evolve to ""if it doesnt react, you are ok"". I just wanted to correct this fallacy.

I've noticed a huge increase in the amount of butane-filled oil popping up all over this subreddit, as well as tons of threads asking the same questions over and over. I think the only way to combat this is to come up with a video that covers all of these answers in an organized way and provides a detailed example of at least one of the many ways that butane-free oil can be obtained. 

That being said, I would love to take on this project but I need some help from you guys (experts and novices alike). Can you guys help me think of some of the common questions asked and pointers/tips that most videos miss?

I am going to be covering: selecting bud and packing, the run and scape/fold (if you have an oil slick), and how to use a vacuum and desiccator.

KungLa0	27	1	99	"I went to both smoke shops in town yesterday in an attempt to pick up a new oil rig, they had been getting more and more pieces in for weeks but this time they were bone dry. I asked both places why, what had happened to all the oil pieces, and they both told me that they were getting flak from a source they'd rather not get into detail about. Essentially, both head shops in my area (CT, USA) had been told that the oil rigs they were selling were illegal (unlike waterpipes which have always been a loop hole) because they had no actual ties to legal products (whereas waterpipes, i.e. bongs, are used for 'tobacco use only). So basically, they have been threatened with having their shops closed/product confiscated and face severe fines if they continue to do it. 

My question to y'all is, has this happened to any other head shops in your area? I cannot find a single thing that would actually make these rigs illegal (until you use them that is). I know these head shops very well and they don't take any BS, they wouldn't just drop a hot new series of product from the shelves unless they were really worried. 

**TL;DR - Local head shops threatened with confiscation of Oil products, stopped carrying them, has this happened to you?**"	t5_2r341	True

-Blasted into Pyrex dish in a hot water bath (outside).
-Moved to griddle on low heat ~130degrees for half hour(still outside).
-moved to vacuum chamber which was set on the griddle at same temp.
-Vac'd for 30 minutes and flame tested.
-Smoked a ton of clean tastey oil!

Pro Tip: I don't whip my oil AT ALL!

Put a 1/2"" layer of Epsom salt in a glass or metal pie plate and bake it in the oven @400F for an hour or so.  When it comes out it will be a solid cookie, let it cool.  Break it up and add it to your alcohol and shake well.

The Essential Oiler is probably the best concentrate vape out at the moment and just like the g-pen, it's just a bunch of rebranded e-cig parts.  The cartridge they use is a [Kanger 510 horizontal coil cartomizer](http://www.litecigusa.net/Kanger_510_Stainless_Horizontal_Coil_Cartomizers_p/510-kanger-carto-ss.htm).  They've just taken out the filler that e-cig juice normally soaks into.  The battery is an [eGo-T 650mAh passthrough](http://www.litecigusa.net/Joye_EGO_USB_Manual_650mah_Battery_p/usbegobatt.htm).  [This video](http://s16.photobucket.com/albums/b19/espmaniac/?action=view&amp;current=ecig.mp4) was posted in the Essential Oiler thread of the Tokecity forum.  The guy giving the instructions is one of the two owners of the Essential Oiler company, but notice he's not actually using an [EE battery](http://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b19/espmaniac/P1030196.jpg).  If you pause at about 42 seconds in, you can see the logo is much smaller and the battery doesn't even appear to be a passthrough.  It says ""eGo-t"" on the side.  I bought the regular eGo-t (non-passthrough) and that's the battery he's using in the video.  You can buy everything offered in the Essential Oiler kit for about $55-$60 bucks.  If you opt to use a non-passthrough battery like I did, it'll be even less.  The EE kits are selling for $115, so you can save a lot buying the e-cig brand parts instead.  Like I've mentioned I have bought and used this setup.  It works great.  I also own a g-pen and while I was satisfied with the g-pen's performance, the EE setup blows it out of the water.  Hope this is useful for you guys.  Cheers.

edit: Fixed the price of the Essential Oiler kit.

I've learned a lot browsing here, so let me give a little back. I have only been reading and learning about this stuff for a couple months or so, and the info below really helped to solidify my understanding about extracts in general. 

First off, this slideshow has a ton of great info about essential oils and the different types of extracts, their properties, the processes involved, plants commonly extracted, etc. Not specific to cannabis, but really good for background info. http://www.slideshare.net/fullscreen/goudewittycomment/allie-yusra-volatileoils/1 

And below, a text dump of a comment I found on the ""Skunk Pharm research"" site. It's a good supplement to the info in the above slideshow, more focused on cannabis. Both came from the same commenter on the site. In general, there's a lot of great info on the site, you probably know about it. I just wanted to highlight this stuff in particular, it's easily missed and very good info. Cheers.

Here's a link to the comment: http://skunkpharmresearch.com/cannabinoid-info/#comment-7086

The legal environment and challenges facing the community of cannabis users today, allows the ability for exploring the ability to extract essential oils from the sacred plant. There are several methods for extraction, with proponents for and against these extraction techniques. Intent of this paper is not to validate or argue which method is “best” of all available techniques. What follows is an abstract of the book, “Perfume and Flavor Materials of Natural Origin” authored by Steffen Arctander in 1960. Creating the book, he extracted numerous essential oils from mother nature, earning him a position of a pioneer in perfume sciences during the 20th century.

The book is available for purchase, and is highly recommended to anyone pursuing the enjoyment of creating natural essential-oils. The price of the book precludes easy access to treasure trove of knowledge within the pages. That is what this article will draw attention to for the reader, basic information about essential oils and the creation of a safe, useable product for the basic consumer.



Creating errl, full-melt, QWET, or even CO2 budder is both art and a science – and art cannot be taught. Arctander, in creating the book, felt the science of perfumery and flavor creation should not be hidden by the select few. Standing on the shoulders of giants only occurs because of the work done by others before our selves. This is why I am writing this paper, to further expand the science behind creating cannabis essential oils.

Starting with definitions of various extracts in alphabetical order by Arctander in the Perfume and Flavor book, and please remember these are perfume definitions that work very well in creating essential oils:

Absolute – A prepared material for perfumes. Highly concentrated and entirely alcohol-soluble, these are generally liquid in form. Absolutes are alcohol-extractions of concretes or other hydrocarbon extractions, e.g. butane, hexane, propane; or from fat-extracts of plant material. Waxes, terpenes, sesquiterpenes and most of the odorless materials will be eliminated from the concrete in creating the absolute. Gentle heat or room temperature evaporates the ETOH (alcohol) used creating the absolute. The mixed alcoholic extract is then chilled for a period of time, dependent upon plant material and species that is used. Waxes, sesquiterpenes, etc. precipitate out of solution in the cold with a subsequent filtration, or centrifuging of the alcoholic absolute. Evaporation of the alcohol requires a gentle vacuum towards the end of the distillation to fully purge the final product. Most absolutes (not all – depending upon a variety of environment factors) will contain trace amounts of ethanol ( around 2% or less). If the alcohol is denatured with a non-volatile or high-boiling point material, this compound will be present in the absolute in significant amounts, since the extraction of the absolute requires many times the quantity of alcohol.

Absolutes in exceptional cases are solid or semi-solid (e.g. sage clary absolute, beeswax absolute, or cannabis). Occasionally the alcohol-soluble fraction of a resinoid is called an absolute. The final product is not identical to the so-called alcohol-resinoid, also commercially known as resin absolute. A resin absolute is a preparation by direct alcohol extraction of the natural material (gum resin, oleo resin, etc.) – cannabis alchemy calls these “quick-wash” ISO or ethanol extracts.

If a natural raw material is first extracted with petroleum ether to produce a resinoid and the resinoid in turn is extracted with alcohol, this process will yield a highly refined and pale colored “absolute”. Petroleum ether extracts of natural gum resins, oleo resins, etc, are often very light-colored resinoids, very suitable for further processing to absolutes of attractive appearance and odor.

Butaflor – A registered name (P. Robertet &amp; Cie.) given to a series of highly concentrated perfume materials produced by butane and subnormal temperatures. Solvent recovery by evaporation at room temperature (boiling point of butane is -0.50C.). Low temperature for extraction and the selective solvent result in a pale-colored, almost wax free and terpeneless product. The method is particularly useful and advantageous when applied to very delicate or heat-sensitive botanical materials, e.g. lilac flowers, lily of the valley, orange flowers, jasmine, roses, and cannabis. It should be noted that not all butaflors are completely alcohol soluble.

Absolute from Chassis – When flowers are removed in the daily batches from the grease trays (chassis), some fat adheres to these flowers. The fat contains botanical oils. Extraction with a hydrocarbon type of solvent isolates the botanical oil-fat rendering a “concrete de chassis” from which a absolute from chassis is in turn produced from alcohol extraction, chilling, filtration, and evaporation.

Absolute from distillation of water – During the steam or water distillation process, distillation waters contain significant amounts of dissolved or dispersed odorous matter which will not readily separate. Such distillations are often extracted with petroleum ether or benzene. After solvent recovery the residual “distillation water concrete” is extracted with alcohol, or it may be used as it comes from the first extraction. Lavender water-absolute, rose water-absolute, etc. are made this way. These absolutes are practically terpeneless and consist mainly of water-soluble components of the essential oil in the plant material. In certain cases, these are the “missing link” between absolutes and essential oils from the same plant material. Water absolutes present highly interesting scent notes which are often missing or wanted in essential oils or perfume bases.

Concrete – A concrete is a prepared perfumery material. Concretes are extracted from non-resinous or low resinous natural raw materials in a method of preparation quite similar to that of resinoids. The natural raw materials from which concretes are prepared from are almost exclusively of vegetable origin, e.g. bark, flower, herb, leaf, roots, etc. Concretes are extracted from previously live tissue, while resinoids are made from plant exudation (not tissue).

Concretes are thus representative of the natural raw material in the sense that they contain all the hydrocarbon-soluble matter, while water and water-extractive matter is left out. Plant tissue, fibers, cellulose, etc. are eliminated as well. The resulting concrete is soluble only to a certain degree in oils and other liquid materials.

Concretes are usually solid, waxy, non-crystalline masses which, on standing, may deposit crystals of almost pure constituents from the extract. Concretes contain higher fatty-acids, frequently lauric and myristic acid. Furthermore, they contain large amounts of alcohol-soluble matter known as absolute.

The amount of absolute in a concrete ranges from less than 20% (which is rare) up to 80% (also rare). In the latter case, the concrete is often liquid, e.g. concrete of Ylang Ylang. A content of 50% of absolute is most common in flower concretes. Jasmine concrete is a typical and well-known concrete.

Concrete from Chassis – An extraction product from the exhaust flowers on the “chassis” . The defleuraged flowers are extracted with a hydrocarbon solvent to yield the concrete from chassis after recovery of the solvent. Jasmine Chassis is a well-known example.

Extract – Extracts are prepared materials. The term extract is used for perfume materials, flavor materials, pharmaceutical products, and many other commercial products. Generally speaking, the term extract refers to concentrated products, obtained by treating a natural material with a solvent. The solution of active ingredients from the natural raw material is subsequently concentrated with evaporation of the solvent, either partially or fully. True extracts do not contain significant amounts of solvent.

Absolutes, Concretes, and Extraits (dissolved extracts), Oleo resins (prepared), Resinoids, Tinctures (dissolved extracts) are all true extracts. They should be considered as solutions of volatile oils, obtained by absorption on the non-volatile solvent.

In flavor terms, the word Extract is used even more indiscriminately. Often applied to dilutions or emulsions of flavor materials in vegetable oils, tasteless solvents (carbon dioxide), or water. True flavor extracts are concentrated materials, liquid, semi-liquid, or solid. They are obtained from natural raw materials by treatment with solvents, and with particular attention to their application in food or beverages. They are generally prepared in the same was as perfumery or pharmaceutical extracts.

A solvent-free alcoholic extract of a resinous raw material is often called a Resin Absolute. It is a further development of the tincture or the infusion which is concentrated.

Resinoid – A resinoid is a perfumery material prepared from natural, resinous substances by extraction with a hydrocarbon type of solvent. True resinoids contain all the hydrocarbon-soluble matter from the natural starting material, including the resins, but they contain no solvent.

The most frequently used solvents are: petroleum ether, benzene, gasoline, butane (butaflor), or in certain cases, acetone, methylene dichloride, trichloro ethylene and other solvents which are not exactly hydrocarbons. Non-volatile solvents are occasionally used.

In contradiction to Concretes, resinoids are generally produced from “dead” (non-cellular) organic material, while the concretes are derived from previously “live” (cellular) tissue, etc. Resinous materials are, e.g. balsams, gum-resins, natural resins, oleo-gum-resins, etc.

Resinoids can be viscous liquids, semi-solid, or solid, but usually homogeneous masses of non-crystalline (amorphous) character. Their main constituents are rosin acids, rosin acid anhydrides, sesquiterpenes, essential oils, plant colors, waxes, and other hydrocarbon-soluble matter.

Sesquiterpeneless Oils – These oils are also called terpene- and sesquiterpeneless oils. Certain essential oils contain little or no monoterpenes, but significant amount of sesquiterpenes, e.g. clove oils, vetiver oils etc. Chemically, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are part of a group known as terpenoid compounds. In Nature, these materials are found almost entirely in the plant kingdom. Sesquiterpenes are important for several reasons, although not quite the same as monoterpenes:

1) Improve solubility in the oil in diluted alcohol or in flavor solvents;
2) To improve perfume and flavor of the essential oil;
3) To lift overall fragrance or flavor of the oil since the sesquiterpenes tend to depress the odor or flavor through the fixative effect of these boiling components.

Point 1) is mutual for mono and sesquiterpenes.
Point 2) and 3) deal with sesquiterpenes in particular. Very stable, they present less trouble than monoterpenes. Generally speaking, the sesquiterpenes are more of a nuisance in flavors than in perfumes. Sesquiterpenes have, as a rule, a rather poor flavor, and most are distinctly bitter.

But I never made extracts, butane scares me, and soaking in Isopropyl takes too long (at least 2 months yeah?). 

Is there a faster way (1 month feom harvest max) to get him some med for muscles? Or should I just give him flowers (green ones) and point him to collectives for extracts (we're thinking topical preferably)?

Canadian Postal workers can't search mail, so as long as the packaging is discreet, and smell free drugs go through the mail like any other package. 

A few weeks ago I decided I finally wanted to try the service, and signed up. I was well aware that I might just be throwing my money away, but I wanted to give it a shot. I ordered some King Kush for around $310/oz. It was pretty good weed, and gave me a 20% yield. Honestly it wasn't really that much greater than the no name kush I get for $240/oz 

Next order I really wanted to get myself a solid sativa since everything in my city is kush, so I ordered a ounce of Cali Thai for their 'Premium buds' section of the site for 230/oz. I knew it would be a step down from the 'Super premium' King Kush, but I wasn't prepared for how bad this bud was. 

[28.1 grams of Cali Thai](http://i.imgur.com/W7sQe.jpg).

It seemed okay at first. It was bone dry which wasn't a big deal, and had an odd fluffy, almost stringy texture I hadn't encountered before. I was expecting at least a 15% yield. 

[This is what I got from running 10 grams](http://i.imgur.com/WrZuh.jpg).

At first I thought that maybe I had somehow packed my tube too tight, and it somehow channeled the butane away from the majority of the buds, but after doing a second, less dense run, and receiving pretty much the same results I knew the problem wasn't my tek. 

I had hoped that it was just some kind of mistake with my order, but after messaging with the Budmail help desk I was politely told it was my fault. 

[Here's the conversation I had with the help desk](http://imgur.com/a/O7s2X).

Despite all this I still have a buddy that's going to make an account just so he can order some more budder. 

Those are all the facts. Make your own judgments.

Let me open this up by giving my ""experience"" with BHO. Not even a year ago, I had only ever dabbed once, and it was a pretty baby sized dab. I got really high, but thought nothing of it. I didn't even know what it was or how it was made, my friend just told me it was a concentrated form of THC, and said it was hash without the plant matter. Made sense.

Then I met someone who made it full time, as pretty much a job. How he came to be so well-connected without really knowing what he was doing, I do not and probably will not be able to understand. However, he made his own brand of either under or overpurged whipped up bullshit. For a while, I was dabbing off of his stuff, but it was all free and I never paid him. I would take a dab or two a session, and not even that big a dabs.

After a bit of doing this, I became interested in the production. I became interested especially in the solvent that was used. I didn't really think about butane as a solvent, I always just thought of it as a fuel, something that could go in BICs. Since I'm a tobacco smoker, I figured there were probably some cancer risks to doing this, but didn't care. I also made the mistake of likening it to crack at first, especially because of how much people gravitated towards it (the dab zombies).

Finally, I met someone who would not only set me (somewhat) straight, and since I was curious he offered to let me sit in on a run and watch him do what he does. Before that he offered to let me dab some of the stuff he had bought from a clinic. Namely, some Larry Lemon OG wax, some GDP wax, and some Pure Gold from tetralabs. This stuff had way more flavor as the stuff I had been dabbing, and more importantly something about it tasted... cleaner.

Then he showed me something I had never seen before. Shatter. I was like... ""what the fuck? I thought it was wax or oil, what is shatter?"" Shatter, he explained to me, is the glass form of wax. He speculated, if it is clear, see through, golden, how can there be any or much butane left in there? 

Over the course of the next few months, he taught me a lot about making hash oil. At first, I was his disciple. He gave me some important values that I stick with in my hash making today. Patience. Controlling any and all variation. Self-criticism. Constant improvement of technique (no one is perfect). Consistency. Knowledge, studying, and never trust an assumption.

After a while I caught up to him, but technique-wise he is a lot more fluid than me in a lot of aspects still. However, one way I contributed from the very beginning was buy purchasing a vac pump + desiccator. After we made some big batches of shatter three or four times without a vac (which took hours upon hours upon hours of work, days of purging, we were patient as fuck), we decided that if we were going to get anywhere with this we would need to invest in some equipment.

Most of what we have run has been trim, though there have been nug runs here and there when money has allowed. However trim or bud, the principals behind it remain the same, even though the flavor and high simply will not be as potent in sugar leaf.

tl;dr I've been toking up obscene amounts of hash oil, after not even knowing what the fuck it was for the first few decades of my life. That's been my experience. What about you guys?

So I recently bought myself the ego-t vape pen and was having trouble finding a good recipe that would work with this type of [cartridge](http://cdn1.bigcommerce.com/server3000/275fa/products/61/images/245/O2_Vapor_Infinity_Clearomizer__55400.1338936955.1280.1280.jpg) that didn't involve a process that took several hours and was not guaranteed to work once the mixture cooled. After some experimenting, it turns out all you need is 100% pure hemp oil. You can buy it at most health food stores or natural marketplaces. Just mix equal parts hash oil and hemp oil and stir for about a minute. use a dropper to transfer the tincture into the clearomizer cartridge and... voila! The mixture (barely) seperates when it settles, but a quick few shakes of the pen and it's good to go again. 3 or 4 hits gets me lifted and total bonus: NO WEED SMELL. Perfect for discreet public medication indoors or out. I had a hard time finding this information online, so I hope this helps somebody!

edit: If you have trouble getting a good draw on your pen, make sure the cartridge is not too full, and that the tincture has enough hempseed oil in it to give it a nice syrupy viscosity.

tl;dr - Perfect vape pen hash oil recipe: Equal parts Hash oil/100% pure hemp oil. Stir gently for about a minute. BAM! Fill your cartridge and enjoy!"	t5_2r341	True

I bought one of these after seeing it here because I was curious to see what kind of vacuum this is capable of producing. I'll state now that the biggest inconvenience about this thing is that it is threaded for a lab sink, and kitchen sinks (generally speaking) have a much finer threading. This means I had to buy a few fittings to make it work with my kitchen sink, but nothing terrible (about $9).


That being said, this thing can actually produce a decently impressive vacuum for what it actually is and does. About 2 and a half minutes after turning it on it can pull a vacuum of 28.5 inHg, not a full vacuum but better than a hand pump in my experience. I also turned the water off after achieving 28.5 and the vacuum did indeed hold (better than I thought actually) and after about 2 hours the vacuum did not seem to go down *at all*. It did manage to pull a consistent vacuum as well, I didn't see any fluctuations up or down while it ran. I have not tried purging anything with it yet.

My next experiment is going to be to hook my hand pump into the same vacuum line, because I am curious to see if I can manage to bump the vacuum up to 29 after it achieves 28.5. So if that work out I'll be back to share my findings :)
