It's called [EL Principe Oso/The Bear Prince](http://www.amazon.com/Principe-Prince-Spanish-English-ebook/dp/B00BUVDEQK/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363523090&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=the+bear+prince). 

It's based on a Mexican folk tale from hundreds of years ago. My native Spanish-speaker wife did the translations, so I hope it may be helpful for some of you.
