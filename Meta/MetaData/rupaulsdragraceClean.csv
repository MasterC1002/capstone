We have heard a lot of member of Team Jinkx being vocal about their support... and I think it is time members of Team Alaska start generating some social media energy in Alaska's favor.  

So if you think Alaska deserves to WIN, vote this up, and let's get this popularity contest started!  

I have been a little snarky in some other posts, so I am going to keep this one positive!

I will never forget you, and I will always smile when I hear or read anything about you. Maybe it was the silly faces you made to the mirror while applying make up. I can no longer use a mirror without doing at least one Alyssa Lips. Maybe it was you laughing hysterically at your own bad jokes. That showed me that there was an unbridled joy for life deep inside you. Maybe I was amazed by the way you endured the abuse and shade you got from the other queens and judges. I now finally understand the old cliche/idiom ""Water off a duck's back."" You just kept prancing around being a silly fairy enjoying every second of life...enjoying every breath. Even that psycho bitch CooCoo CoCo could not bring you down from your ""natural high."" It was amazing to watch, and the world would be a better place if everyone took your approach to petty drama.

The judges and other queens maligned you and read you for saying something to the extent of ""If I have to lip sync for my life every week I will!"" I did not find the statement weird or alarming. I know drag queens personally, and every performance is literally Lips-Sync For Your Life. Drag is a job...not a TV show. The dissing you got for that statement is shade at it's PUREST!

I would love for you to have your own reality series. I would enjoy being your friend. I will most definitely attend any show you may perform in the future if it is in a 200 mile radius of me. You are a glorious human being and I fucking love you!

...my wife told me about this show at the start of the current season and honestly I had no interest whatsoever. But to humor her, I watched the first episode and was mildly amused. Then I watched another and started developing opinions about the various contestants. And then I became totally engrossed. 

..I have developed serious rooting interests. I am emotionally invested in how the lip syncs turn out. When there were six contestants left, I realized I could name them all. Shit got real.

""I’m not the type of person to partake in petty drama simply to get more screen time.  That’s why I hardly get a word in edge-wise during UnTucked.  I prefer to let my work speak for itself, and let my facial expressions say a thousand words.  If I could tell anyone to “shut the fuck up” as you put it, I’d probably say it to all the girls coming up next season.  Don’t scream over each other.  Don’t fight just for fighting’s sake.  America is sick of it and I think we’re at a point where we can be respectful and grown-up and still make great television. ""

1365286112.0	1btht5	PSA: Don't stalk queens!	wendigogogo	119	16	61	"Thankfully, I haven't seen this bullshit here but I *have* noticed it other places so I just wanted to voice it. 

Yesterday, a video of one of Sharon/Alaska's friends visiting them in PGH was getting reblogged around tumblr. The problem was that some people reblogged it and talked about how great it was that you could figure out which apartment was theirs and where. The video has since been reuploaded and edited (a part where they're walking up to the apartment was chopped) but the fact still remains that that is *completely* unacceptable behavior.

This isn't the first time I've seen people saying creepy, stalkery shit but it's always been one statement that gets dogpiled by saner members of the community. In this case, a bunch of people were agreeing and getting excited because, whee, we figured out where they live! Not only is that really weird and inappropriate, it disrespects the queens when you essentially broadcast where they live and your intentions to find them. It also places the entire fandom in a bad light and affects how queens might react to us.

I'm very glad that this subreddit has not stooped to those shenanigans but please, if you see people saying this sort of shit, knock them down a peg or two. We don't want the queens to feel unsafe in their own neighborhoods because of crazy fans!  

Edit: This thread kind of went off in a few other directions so I just wanted to say I'm sorry if people's feelings got hurt.  I think some of the other topics (fanfiction, asking about sexual choices, etc.) are really a person by person opinion thing and what I think is weird may be someone else's cup of tea and things I think are ok may be odd to another person. Hell, the idea of a drag queen fandom is probably weird in itself! 

My core point was, regardless of the topic at hand, remember to respect the queens, their feelings and their privacy, first and foremost. I know that there exists consequences of celebrity where their lives are more open that of the average person. That doesn't mean they don't deserve *any* privacy, though, which is something that some fans need to be reminded of at times.  "	t5_2t3or	True

You act like because your the first big girl - no bitch Latrice is the first big girl.  I love Roxxxy and I am not trying to read her right now, but she acts like the savior for all plus sized queens - bitch what size do you wear an XXL?  That's nothing.  Also, that fake interruption last night - I'm not about that - I was like where is Willam to call some bullshit right now, cus you are pulling a PhiPhi/Sharon type deal from the reunion.  That's All

EDIT: I love Roxxxy and this is not to read her.  It is to clock it how I see it.  I know she's fierce and she has so much confidence - but I feel like she sees herself as this season's Latrice.  Yes, she was the biggest girl on this season, HOWEVER, she is nowhere near the biggest person to step foot in the werk room."	t5_2t3or	True

1376149582.0	1k3ci9	Alaska: Red for Filth -- a fan response	buddy311	80	9	26	"Alaska's show is amazing. So much more than I ever expected (and that's from someone who went in as a super fan). 

It opens with Alaska in full camp mode delivering exaggerated vocals on staples such as ""Don't Cry Out Loud"" and original songs such as ""The Gayest Thing You've Ever Seen."" However, the show does follow a slight narrative, which is that it is the last night alive for Ms. Thunderfuck (who suffers respiratory problems -- as we all know she is an alien from Glamtron 5000). This is mostly a funny device (she coughs up increasingly large amounts of blood into a hanky she stores in her chest), but Alaska's voice evolves into a more sincere instrument over the course of the show and by the time she nails her closing numbers (""Dreams"" by Grace Slick, ""Don't Dream It, Be It"" from The Rocky Horror Show) the notion of a an alien creature singing her heart out as she makes her way toward death actually attains some real gravitas. This highlights what a genuine talent and vulnerable performer Alaska can be while never sacrificing her insane antics and truly bizarre characterizations.  

I still feel Drag Race never truly demonstrated the brilliance of Alaska's drag persona -- that of a space alien who comes to earth and emulates (and in many senses miscalibrates) images of and attitudes about glamour. To me, Alaska Thunderfuck is an amalgamation of everything gauche and a reflection of how artificial our global concept of beauty truly is (fake hair, fake nails, fake everything). What people read her for (the ""rough around the edges"" approach she takes to high glamour) is actually the root of what makes her drag such great art. Rather than covering up the means of her construction, and trying to normalize or naturalize these artificial tools of femininity (makeup, nails, hair), Alaska exposes (and also celebrates) them as the false additives that they are. She loves glamour but never confuses it with reality. It's such a brilliant character, and she's such a bright star. "	t5_2t3or	True

1363914817.0	1arsms	The Drag Glossary	RuPaulRyan	72	4	88	"I thought we could compile a glossary of words and expressions that are commonly used in the drag community and on the show. Might make things a bit easier for people who are new to the show or who aren't that familiar with the drag scene.

Please feel free to add words that I have forgotten, as I'm sure I have. And, of course, edit as you see fit.

**Fishy** An adjective that describes a queen who is looking and acting particularly feminine. A fishy queen is a queen who looks like a woman.

**Reading** Reading is the art of craftily insulting other queens. It's not as easy as simply insulting someone (""you're fat"" or ""you're ugly"") - it is much more nuanced and involves really taking a jab at someone's personality and appearance using calculated words. An insult is known as a ""read."" If someone really gets read, they are ""read to filth.""

**T** The 'T' is the gossip, the news, the rumors about the queens. When someone wants to know the latest gossip, she might ask ""What's the T?"" 

**Shade** - Shade is basically a collective term for insults and reads. A queen is ""throwing shade"" when she is being particularly mean or rude to another queen. A queen who loves to talk behind another queen's back is ""shady.""

**Gagging** - A queen who does something particularly impressive, awe-inspiring, and phenomenal will leave an audience 'gagging,' which is to say that they are completely wowed at her performance. 

**KiKi** - When two queens get together to talk, chat, catch up, gossip. Not to be confused with...

**KaiKai** - When two drag queens have sex with each other.

**Banjee** - A lot of people use this word wrong. What it actually means is someone who is masculine and can pass as straight. 

**____ the house down** - When a queen does something particularly well, or when something happens to the fullest extent that it can, it is ____ the house down. Example, a queen who is particularly good at reading other queens can 'read the house down.'

**Beat** - An adjective used to describe queens (or cisgendeed women) who are particularly attractive and who are great with make-up. Also used a verb, as in 'beat your face' to make your make-up particularly great.

**Cook** - The process of letting all the makeup settle in on the face. 

**Realness** - When a queen tries to imitate a certain genre, she is giving you _____ realness. For example, executive realness.

Roxxxy accused Alyssa of not knowing the words and turning her back to the judges to hide it, but from what we saw, Roxxxy spent most of that song not lip syncing either! While Alyssa was *performing* and whipping her hair, Roxxy was standing in one spot just giving herself whiplash. Alyssa was killing that song. Killed it, killed it dead. Roxxxy also was working hard, but did NOT out preform Alyssa, and stayed because after having such a raw emotional breakdown, you couldn't possibly send her home.

Jinkx said that it was going to be a photo finish because they were both giving it 100%, and I agree. But I think ultimately Alyssa did better, but it was the breakdown that kept Roxxy there.

Roxxxy should have been sent home, but got a sympathy pass. And yet she has the audacity to shit talk Alyssa and say that Jinkx gets a pass? Da Fuck? "	t5_2t3or	True

&gt;ok let me address the issues of last nights episode…ALL TEA ALL SHADE! 
just so thats its out there and cause there is no explanation. if u feel like reading this than read. if not then i cant make you.
did i say all the things on last nights episode YES! I am a pageant girl who is NOT new to competition. IT CAN GET VERY UGLY! We were so stressed and i let every little thing bother me and needed to shut the hell up. Im not going to make EXCUSES! the things i said and did WERE on the verge of BULLYING and just plain out HORRIBLE. Jinkx was my BIGGEST competition and scared the SHIT out of ME and it kills me that i would have done her the way i did. NO ONE DESERVES THAT! im NOT looking for sympathy nor anyone to feel bad for me. for the people who know me and have met me know exactly how against that i am and how much i go out of my way for people. i am a true believer of actions speak louder than words. Jinkx is an amazing person inside and out and is the exact opposite of me but JUST AS GOOD BABY! she was someone i never saw as a threat from as close minded as i was back then and ended up my BIGGEST competition! In life we learn a lot of lessons through experiences and i learned so much! we all have growing up to do and make MANY mistakes. some of mine just happen to be on national television. if i lost you as a fan i APOLOGIZE FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART! for i would have lost MYSELF as a fan from watching that last night. But i will do whatever it takes to prove to u all that im NOT that person! We all make mistakes. 
SO LET ME ANSWER ALL THE PEOPLES QUESTIONS….
Am i blaming editing? NO because i had to say those things at some point… BUT, they Can put it anywhere they want in the show. regardless of what episode i actually said it in.
am i ashamed of my actions? ABSOLUTELY! 
To some it up before its said again and again … IM NOT asking for everyone to read this and forgive me… but i do want you to know how bad i feel and ashamed i am. un like other queens im being compared to i DO have a heart and my actions were NOTTTT in the right whatsoever!
i love u all and may god help me continue to learn from my mistakes and help me be a better person that what i saw last night.

&gt;love u all
&gt;Roxxxy Andrews

1368060250.0	1dyxcj	What I hope to see for season 6	ZuG	71	14	58	"RPDR is due for a tweaking. The sparkly magic of past seasons was really missing for me this time around, and I feel like it's time to switch some stuff up.

1. RPDR is the only mainstream image of gay culture in the wild right now. I watch the show primarily to see queens at the top of their game that I would never normally know about pushing themselves to even greater heights. Work that! Give queens more than a couple of days between when they find out they made RPDR and when they show up for filming. Give them more time to think and to put together outfits. Give them more days off during filming. Time pressure is good, but too much time pressure results in exhausted queens and poorly conceived and executed outfits. 

2. Lose the shady editing. Conflict is important, and seeing queens throw shade at each other is awesome... when it's memorable. All the bickering between Alyssa and Coco got old, fast. It should have been cut down to a few major scenes (""look how fucking orange you look!"") and all the rest of their inane back and forth needed to end up on the cutting room floor. Along those lines, show what actually happened. There were so many scenes that were obviously cut together that didn't happen just to drum up drama (as an example, Roxxxy snickering at Jinkx's narcolepsy in the sugar bowl never happened. The snickering was about something completely different and was edited to make it look like she was making fun of Jinkx's disorder). RPDR has a smart audience. Most of us are too savvy to be fooled by that shit, so stop it already. 

3. Fix the finale. We want to see what happens when the winning queen *actually wins*, not a faked win. Come up with another way to keep the winner secret, because what you're doing isn't working. Do it live. Sequester the queens. Anything would be better than getting fake reactions at the most important moment of the entire season. 


Do ya'll agree with me? What else needs to be switched up?

Now it is one thing to be fierce and defend yourself, but it is another thing to be fierce in the defense of someone else who is vulnerable and also to do it in a diplomatic manner. Negativity from/about Coco aside, Detox should be applauded for her positive spirit.

We all wish we had friends who stood up for us at one point or another in our lives, or wish we had been the person who stood up for others. This week Detox was that person. Hurray for Detox, a fierce and kind queen."	t5_2t3or	True

DixieCyanide	65	7	397	"**ANNOUNCEMENT:** With an overwhelming amount of early support, next week's theme will be **Stage** **and** **Screen** **Musicals** No Disney/Animated films, as that *might* be a category later. Just Broadway musicals and the like, whether the movie version or the stage version. Remember, be creative! No one wants to watch fifteen of the same song.

Also, and this is going to be tough, but if we want to have one ""episode"" a week, and not *drag* this out until Christmas (I know I don't want to, no offense, sweeties) I'll be announcing who is staying and who is sashaying away when I put up each week's videos. HOWEVER, since this means you will all be recording a video for the new theme, I intend to post it anyways, as sort of a ""goodbye"" performance. 

Does this work for everyone? It had better, because I've formatted it on the fly. This should make it so we can have ample voting time (the whole week), ample time to make new videos (also the whole week), and the contest won't last until we have to start serving parka realness.


*Now* *back* *to* *your* *regularly* *scheduled* *post*:

Hello darlings!

Below are your contestants for the Subreddit Lipsync Competition! If anyone finds any errors in my formatting or links, please let me know.

**Important** **Information**: After you've viewed the videos, please vote for **one** person either by posting a comment with that person's name in it, or by messaging me if you wish to keep your vote private. 

Also, when you vote on a person, please vote for **two** themes you'd like to see over the next **two** weeks. (I'm trying to get ahead here, so in the future I can have a theme the night the videos go up. The next theme will be announced by Monday night at the latest, so vote for themes, at least, quickly!)

Please try to keep themes fairly broad, like ""80s"" or ""Musicals,"" not things like ""Blonde female singers from 1973 who used the word ""Love"" at least twice."" Give people some room here!

**Upvotes** **do** **not** **count** **as** **votes**. You must **comment** or **message** me. You have all week to vote.

Now, without further adieu, here's Week One: Queens' (or Kings') Choice!

1359533424.0	17jvut	Behind the scenes dish from Season 5, Episode 1 (and beyond) from Jinkx via our viewing party last night!	suzepie	69	6	28	"So, I attended a RPDR viewing party last night here in Seattle and our own Jinkx Monsoon was in attendance to perform and answer questions. She shared a lot of behind-the-scenes dish with us, and I wanted to pass on the favor by sharing it with you lovely people! So here goes. 


**THAT RED-HAIRED GODDESS!**
Jinkx is a blonde. So how did her Season 5 “Goddess” promo pic end up as a redhead? The producers asked her to bring dresses and wigs for this goddess theme, and she obliged, bringing lots of different choices. They hated all of them. And they felt they already had enough blondes and enough “mermaid shapes,” which were the types of gowns Jinkx had brought. So they styled her themselves, top to bottom, and put her in what she calls her “Mrs. Lovett” wig, which she ended up loving.  She refers to turquoise blue as her “power color,” so she was perfectly happy to be dressed in it. 


**NARCOLEPSY!**
About the narcolepsy: Is it real? Yep, sure is. The producers had her talk to doctors while she was being considered for the show, to make sure it wouldn’t be a problem. She’s medicated, but she still needs to take naps when she feels it coming on. She told us that Lineysha Sparks was really sweet and every time Jinkx would lay down for a nap, Lineysha would come put a blanket over her. Oh, and you know that “confessional” interview where she appears to nod off and start snoring? ALL REAL. They did trim the end of her sentence – she swears she finished it – but she really did fall asleep during her interview. 


**A LITTLE WHIFF OF HOME**
As the first NW queen, Jinkx was afraid she’d feel out of place, but it turns out she’d worked with Jade before in Portland, and seeing her made Jinkx feel more comfortable. She also found a few comfortable smells from home: Ivy Winters (“Isn’t he adorable?” she asked us) douses herself in patchouli (very NW hippie, you know), and Pit Crew member Shawn doesn’t wear deodorant … so the two of them added a little fragrant familiarity! 


**SISTERHOOD**
Speaking of Ivy, Jinkx said that of all the queens, the two that she became closest with were Alaska, of course (they’re touring together and have an upcoming show in Pomona!) and Ivy, who I guess is just a wonderful girl, very sweet, caring, and helpful. Ivy is also a very talented seamstress and makes dresses for Lady Bunny!!


**SEW WHAT?**
Jinkx took a few quick sewing lessons before the show started, but really doesn’t know how to sew too well. Her first gown – that beautiful blue number she made from the dumpster diving challenge – was *braided* together. Yep. She cut the fabric into little strips and braided it to get it to stay in place. Not a stitch in it! 


**ABOUT PENNY**
Jinkx had very nice things to say about Penny Tration, who went home first. She described her as very kind and helpful, pitching in wherever needed. She mentioned that she (Jinkx) helped whenever she was asked, too. And then she offered a quote (which she attributed to “anonymous”) that went something like this: A candle loses nothing when it lights another candle. What a beautiful spirit of giving. She talked about the difference between competing *against* someone and competing *with* them, and how she will only do the latter. Really a very generous soul. There were a lot of really touching moments, to be honest. A lot of talk about family and support, and biological vs. “logical” families. Jinkx is blessed with the support of both, but not everyone is so lucky. 


**PENISES!**
Inquiring minds wanted to know: Is Alaska’s junk really that big?? She smiled so big and leannnnned back on her stool and paused. And then said something like, “If you’re going to go and get naked in a room full of gay men, you’d better make sure it’s worth it. And with Alaska, it was.” The room erupted in laughter and applause. Then she went on to say that the reason Alaska was whipping it around was that after a few hours tucked, a man’s junk gets, well … she compared it to the difference between spaghetti and linguini. One’s nice and long and round, and the other is just flat! You have to kind of air it out and let it recover! 


**THE DRINKS**
And the drinks they’re served while they wait in the Interior Illusions Lounge? Yes, they have alcohol (she gave a shout out to Absolut), and are delicious, but they’re pretty watered down, she said. They don’t want the girls plastered, but it’s enough to get a little tipsy. 


**THE JUDGES**
Oh, here’s a tidbit for you: Jinkx has a big ol’ crush on Santino! She says she digs the “Rasputin thing” he has working for him. When asked if she was ever able to let him know, she said, “No, he was too busy reading me for not being stylish enough.” And Michelle Visage? She said, ""here’s the thing about Michelle Visage. Of all the jewelry I brought with me, the only things she absolutely loved was the stuff that came from Claire’s. SO.” 



I’ve met and chatted with Jerick (as himself and as Jinkx) four times now and he is a sweet, kind, down-to-earth young man with a HUGE future in front of him. I talked to him again after the viewing party and he was happy and overwhelmed with how well it went. He had been a little unsure of what it’d be like to sit and watch himself on TV with a group of people in attendance, but there was so much love and support (and we all applauded and screamed every time he was onscreen) that it ended up being really wonderful for him. He’s decided to come to next week’s viewing party, too, and I plan on being there, so if there’s more dish, I’ll share it!

This topic has been brought up a few times in the past.  I just want to ask that you all be mindful of downvoting and reddiquette.

Remember downvotes are for comments and posts that **do not contribute** anything to a discussion or the subreddit in general.  They can also be used on highly inappropriate comments/posts.

Just because another redditor has different opinions than you does not mean they should be downvoted.

**Why follow reddiquette?**

Because when someone gets downvoted to hell for saying, ""I like &lt;unpopular queen&gt;"" or ""I hate &lt;popular queen&gt;"" it CHOKES discussion and leaves us with little more than a circlejerk.

*Example:* Pro-Jinkx circlejerk, Anti-Roxxxy circlejerk, Anti-Coco circlejerk.  We get it.  You love Jinkx and hate the other two.  That doesn't mean people who like Roxxxy or Coco and aren't wowed by Jinkx are wrong; it means they have a different opinion and that is **healthy** for discussion.

We are not a circlejerk subreddit.  We ARE a drag race **discussion** subreddit.  Let's keep it that way!  Please and thank you, and love to you all."	t5_2t3or	True

1362767692.0	19xbf2	Mid-Season Review of the top 7 Queens: Discussion	theGstandsforGabriel	58	4	39	"14 Queens entered, and only half remain. I wasn't able to give my thoughts on the latest episode, so instead, here’s my take on the remaining queens based on their overall performance so far in the competition. I'd love to hear what you all think about the top half as well. Also, thanks to dilettwat for the images I've mercilessly stolen.

**Jinkx Monsoon** – Jinkx is the only queen so far who has managed to stay out of the bottom consistently every week because, when it comes to challenges, she does it all. She sings, she acts, she can NAIL an impersonation. But what’s actually impressive about Jinkx is how she deals with things she can’t do. She’s not a seamstress, so she braided her episode 1 outfit together. She’s not a ballet dancer, so she made it her own. She’s adaptive and trusts herself enough to give it her all despite her confidence issues backstage. Her performances not only keep her out of the bottom, but probably should have gotten her at least another win this season, because she’s so close every time. And looking forward to future challenges (a roast, a commercial, an acting challenge), it’s fairly obvious that she’ll be around a while. That being said, her runways ARE shticky. As she herself has said, she was space-age one week, victorian another. They’ve each been solid but ultimately they lack a certain gag-factor that the judges seem to require. What Michele calls Glamour. And it’s a simple fix: Jinkx could easily ease up on her makeup (which, to be fair, comes from a theatre and not runway background) and give us some more voluminous wigs. After all, who doesn’t love a Drag Queen with Gigantic Hair?

**BEST RUNWAY**: Episode 3
http://i.imgur.com/YNPoQPC.gif

Jinkx is in her element. She’s done the best job this week of taking the runway theme and making that into a look, a character, and a story. No, it’s not exactly couture, but Jinkx knows how to construct an outfit and control her level of detail. It’s smart and very easily could have nabbed her the win.

**WORST OUTFIT**: Episode 6
http://dilettwat.typepad.com/.a/6a017d3f6e48be970c017ee9036bce970d-800wi

The GIF says it all. Yawn. This look is everything that is wrong with Jinkx this season. Flat hair, heavy contour, and an outfit that gets outshined by the character she attaches to it. Is it a good character? Yes. Does it go with the outfit? Yes, and if she wore this as part of a show (www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0kLCP6fEMs) I’d watch the hell out of it. But not only is it not a piece of wearable art, it didn’t fit the theme. I’ve looked over it a dozen times and still can’t figure out what it is she’s supposed to be highlighting.

Grade: A


**Ivy Winters**—Ivy has that rare mix of performance ability and fashion sense that promises great things. She can sing, she can act, and she can sew and WEAR a dress. Her only weakness that I’ve been able to tell is that she relies on preparation. Give her a script, an outfit, a choreographer and she can turn it out. But as we’ve seen from her Snatch game and a bit from her general behavior backstage, she lacks improvisation skills and a genuine personality that we can see (her runways all tend to show the same performer-face that weirdly doesn’t move too much). And given the fact that there are three more acting challenges, one of which is live, it’s risky. Personally, I hope she makes it far. I’d love to see how she handles the make-a-dress and ball challenges, because her runway looks have been the most consistently stellar and she has a real talent for costuming that the first few challenges haven’t given her a chance to display.

**BEST RUNWAY**: Episode 6
http://i.imgur.com/L08Y46P.jpg

Such a hard choice, but this look in particular is the best at showing off her talents. She made a dress out of photographs, dammit. And it still manages to have a line which, along with her hair-frame, actually highlights her face, which was the challenge.

**WORST RUNWAY**: Episode 3
http://i.imgur.com/OgNUTat.png

Not exactly bad. Just less interesting than the rest of what she’s showed us. Love her runways.

GRADE: B+

**Roxxxy Andrews**—Her greatest strength is her personality. She’s uninhibited and bold when she needs to be, and it shows in her best runways and in the performance challenges she’s been the most successful at. Her weakness comes when she tries to put on a more serious persona, specifically a pageant-esque face and look on the runway. From what I’ve gathered, she’s a Queen in transition. Where she once depended on big hair and heavier makeup and a generous silhouette, her recent weight loss (Go her!) has given her a newfound confidence that doesn’t necessarily match up with her experience and the drag she has to work with. But when she shows the new her, the her who isn’t afraid to have fun and show off, she shines through better than almost any other queen, and that’s what the competition is all about.

**BEST RUNWAY**: Episode 1 (duh)
http://i.imgur.com/9W1smR8.png

It’s goth. It’s glam. It’s complex. It’s elegant. And most of all, Roxxxy has found a way to make this outfit fun. When she walks down the runway, she gives a flash of hip and owns her look so well that we’re proud of it for her.

**WORST RUNWAY**: Episode 4

I couldn’t get a good image of this due to this week’s 30 SECOND runway, but faithful viewers will remember this bit of rainbow realness. What’s wrong with this outfit (and what’s wrong with her previous two outfits) isn’t so much the dress as it is the way Roxxxy wears it. In an attempt to be statuesque and glamorous (starting to hate that word), she gives us nothing to work with but the outfit alone, which in this case was poorly cut, poorly fit, and ultimately boring.

Grade: B

**Alaska**—I want to talk about Alaska. Because I personally feel the judges have been incredibly misguided in their critiques. Alaska is smart and funny and most importantly, she has delivered consistently strong work. Look at her two times in the ‘bottom.’ The first was for a stellar performance and the best team captainship we’ve ever seen, tainted by the judges view of her “boy drag.” The second was for her failure to show vulnerability in the challenge when in fact she gave the strongest performance in her team. I get the sense that the producers want to construct a narrative around Alaska, but the evidence doesn’t exactly support that. All that aside, she hasn’t shown us the strongest runway presentations, often relying on the same super-slim silhouette and signature wiggle. Which, being a performer, I can understand. Still, if she’s going to go further, she needs to step up her game even more in challenges and take some tips from the other queens to provide a more varied runway look.

**BEST RUNWAY**: Episode 3
http://i.imgur.com/0R53Dkb.png

Here, Alaska demonstrates what she can do when she makes a runway a performance instead of trying to give fish and glam and couture. And ironically, those are exactly what she gives us. This look is flattering, complex, editorial, and designed to stand out from the rest of the crowd, and this week should have been very close between her and Jinkx and not Detox (sorry ‘bout it).

**WORST RUNWAY**: Episode 5
http://i.imgur.com/5RK3Ef7.gif

She’s going for a character here, which I respect, but her camp and use of props, unlike above, doesn’t have a solid outfit to back it up. Here she’s trying too hard to give the judges too many things and fails to please, despite how cute she looks.

Grade: B-

**Detox**—For a queen who claims to do it all, Detox has managed to stay safe quite a bit, her only win sadly undeserved (or at least it was REAL damn close). Her greatest strength is her confidence and her ability to draw attention. Her greatest weakness is her reliance on her…augmeneted features. About half of her outfits are those of a queen who knows her herstory and delivers looks which are editorial and incredibly smart. The other half ask us to ignore their shortcomings and look at her face/chest/shoulders instead. She cultivates a very Ke$ha-esque persona sometimes (see how that worked out) and tries to get by on edginess. When she doesn’t do that and instead fits her talents to a different sort of look, she shines.

**BEST RUNWAY**: Episode 4
http://i.imgur.com/JTlABY7.png

God. Damn. This look has it all. The color, the hair, the geometry, and the fact that it is a look tailored to the hint of 60’s suggested by the ballet challenge. It’s incredibly smart and is exactly what a winner would wear.

**WORST RUNWAY**: Episode 5 (with Ep 4 comparison!)
http://i.imgur.com/xkwIKdg.jpg

I couldn’t tell, looking at this fishy outfit, if she was supposed to be a jellyfish or a regular fish caught in a plastic trash bag. It’s a similar shape to last week’s, but it gets lazy, and she knows it. Notice how the whole thing is one giant arrow pointing to her face? That’s probably not an accident, but her silicone here doesn’t make up for it.

Grade: C

**Alyssa Edwards**— We have a lot of fun with Alyssa and her faces, but she’s very professional, if not quite as well-rounded as the other queens. She gives great face every week, and she’s clearly the best dancer, but she’s been carried through a lot of the acting challenges by either immunity (Katy Perry) or by her willingness to power through with the funny (Singing). Which is a great quality to have and she’s deserved to be safe every time. But once the weaker queens are gone, that’s not going to be enough to compete with the real performers, and that puts her in a tough position.

**BEST RUNWAY**: Episode 6
http://i.imgur.com/y25MENu.png

This gives a great example of all of Alyssa’s best qualities. She gives great face, arms, hair, legs… and here she has the good sense to cover up what doesn’t work as well while still giving a silhouette.

**WORST RUNWAY**: Episode 5
http://i.imgur.com/S9z6LIA.jpg

And here’s everything wrong with Alyssa’s look. Flat hair, heavy makeup, earring that point south to a nonexistent bust and a dress that is sadly a little too form-fitting to flatter her. It’s part of the pageant look that she sometimes relies on and which is often hit or miss.

Grade: C-

**Coco Montrese**—She’s had to lip-sync twice and, apart from Detox, she’s the only one left who has. And it makes sense. Coco’s stayed safe by being slightly better than the worst queens week after week, but she shies away from challenges she should be able to do very well at. She’s made some smart choices and they’ve paid off in a big way, but when Coco is out of her element or feels a lack of control, she has a tendency to check out, and this places her in the bottom and in the prime spot to go home soon. Likely, though, she’ll stick around a little longer. She absolutely kills at lip-syncs and if she deigned to put in HALF of that energy into a challenge (like her Leshauwn Beyond), she’d be a force to reckon with.

**BEST RUNWAY**: Episode 2
http://i.imgur.com/Q1J0y6o.png

Personally, I felt Coco’s team was the best this week and that she was best on her team. Deserved the win or at least to be in the top. What makes this outfit so great is the detailing and the way that she pairs things together. It’s not a perfect look, and far from the best that week. But it’s her best, and that counts for something, I guess.

**WORST RUNWAY**: Episode 3

I’m not going to put up a picture of her Pedo-Realness look. Suffice it to say it was a bad choice with a worse pay-off.

1367845595.0	1dsfxo	I'm going to XL for the first time tonight, which made me realize: Rupaul's Drag Race has literally given me life	sirkusfreakinc	53	2	19	"So, a little background; I'm a very introverted straight girl. Hardly any friends, I don't really go out, my life is kinda blah sometimes :/ 

HOWEVER, I am a total fangirl for RPDR, &amp; I have slowly come out of my shell through my love of the show. After lurking for what seemed like forever, I actually started commenting on this subreddit. I've started talking to people more at work, &amp; after years of being a tomboy, I have begun -*gasp*- wearing makeup :)

My thing is: I have two friends &amp; a brother who are gay; I know how hard it is *just to be gay*. Being a drag queen takes it to a whole other level. If these men can give the world a big ""Fuck You"" by just getting dolled up &amp; having fun with life, why can't I?

So tonight, I am going to XL to see these queens LIVE, camera in one hand, bills in the other, &amp; a face made very bustedly :) To top it off, I made dinner reservations, so all morning I've been singing to myself:

""No line for me

No line for me

I'm VIP

Bitch, that's the T"" xD

* First we as mods want to keep the subreddit as free from sexism, homophobia, and transphobia as possible. This is important and non-trivial in a show which pushes a lot of boundaries and blurs a lot of already blurry lines regarding gender and expression.

**As the queens have said in the show:** *This is the LAST place where close-mindedness is tolerated*.

* We realize that there are specific LGBT* issues that many of you are not familiar with, or may have questions about (myself included). 

* I expect you could find better discussion in /r/lgbt, /r/transeducate, or /r/asktransgender if you bring honest questions.
**We have never had to remove a user from this subreddit due to problems beyond spamming or hate-trolling** but we are not above doing so if we feel as though someone is making others feel unwelcome with their language.

*On that note, if any reading/shade/bickering is getting out of hand, please don't hesitate and PM us mods so we can find a fair way to resolve the matter.*

Love you all! Remember: this subreddit is as much yours as it is ours. Keep it fierce, ladies and ladyboys!"	t5_2t3or	True

**Edit:** For those of you wondering how she affords her shoes, she doesn't buy them. ""Admirers"" buy them for her. No she doesn't sleep with them, they just think she's going to.

BUT (and this is a big ""but"") she's obviously got some issues to work through. Maybe its part of her stage presence, but she had no hesitation after her first performance in stating how Sharon Needles ""doesn't respect her fans anymore"" because she didn't do a meet and greet after her last performance. 

THEN, she proceeded to make everyone wait for an hour after the show ended for the ""meet and greet"" section, which she emerged for incredibly wasted and only talked to people she already knew. 

Would I go see her again? No. There are wayyy too many drag queens from RPDR that are positive, friendly and way more open to talking than this gal.

Anyone else have any experiences with her?

Courtney Act
Laganja Estranja
Adore Delano
Ben DeLaCreme
Darienne Lake
Gia Gunn

This also seems to seriously reinforce the rumors that these queens were on the show as they all returned the very same weekend (roughly 5 or so weeks since their mass exodus around June 8th). 

I still feel pretty confident Bianca Del Rio and Kelly Mantle were also there, though nothing yet from either. Trinity Bonet and April Carrion are harder as they were never much for social networking beforehand. Curious to see who the 2-4 girls are that no one has clocked yet."	t5_2t3or	True

""Alaska does have a distinctive look that makes an impression - ironically busted, awkward celebutante/starlet.

Its performance this week, however, was truly awful, even by its usual low standards. It went to buffering literally every 10 seconds during Untucked. It ruined what was one of the most emotional episodes of the entire show. Almost every single comment on Untucked's page right now is a complaint about the video player. This is unacceptable.

Logo, I honestly, truly want to support one of my favorite shows, but you're making it difficult. During Season 4, I torrented as many episodes as I could just so I could avoid your video player.

Here's a [really short video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LcPIXhsahg&amp;feature=youtu.be) telling you who's staying, who's sashaying, and what next week's theme is. I do need to add that after a late vote or two, the person I announced as winner actually **TIED** with **thisdecadesucks** so we have two winners this week! Yay!

(ETA: I do realize that the pronunciation of Ms. Eggs's name is probably ""Eggs Grainey,"" based on her YouTube name, but I was doing that from memory and had had a drink or two. Sue me.)

Next week's theme, the oft-voted-on ""Foreign Fierceness"" comes with one caveat: Whatever song you do has to be at least 50% non-English, as I believe we are all English-speakers here. I'm instituting the 50% rule to make it easier to find a song, as many foreign songs include some English lyrics.
Here are your Disney videos, they are fantastic:

Don't be too mean, I haven't done it much. :D

Mondays and Thursdays are Drag Race days, and we'll gather in the TinyChat at around 6 PM PST/9 ET. We'll watch drag related videos before the ""official"" time, like music videos, cruise videos, queen's performances, whatever. And then once the usual drag race time hits, we'll watch the episode. And since we're on Season One and it doesn't have Untucked, we'll watch classic drag movies afterward! Like Paris is Burning, Too Wong Foo, Hedwig and the Angry Inch...so on.
(unless we can find the elusive Under the Hood)

So. The schedule for the summer/fall is Mondays and Thursdays are Drag Days, I'll put up the streams for the episodes and/or find a way to hijack the chatroom to play the videos.

**Schedule**

 Mondays and **Thursdays**

Pre show: Drag vids and chatting about whatever. This time is for whatever, I'll be up in the chat at about 12 PM PST. 

 9 E/8 CT 6 PT: Drag Race!

After episode: Drag Movies/More Videos/Untucked!

1365125363.0	1bpcne	Taking Notes for the Confessional Sleuthing! Will update as I go. EPISODE 1.	aemerz	46	5	34	"Hi everyone! I'm doing a re-watch for confessional outfits to see what 'confessions' are from which time-period. I'll be updating as I go, and creating new threads for each episode. This is pretty much an easier way to keep my notes down, and the best way I can make sure I'm taking the correct notes (add and compare your own notes if you'd like too!) I'll update as I find things, but for now, here are my findings. The outfits will be in order of first shown and will be marked with a (minute:second) time stamp to track how many confessions are in that outfit. This is just to get a rough feeling of the order the confessions were filmed, and this will be mixed eventually with the other episodes confessions, and then I will scrutinise which outfit was worn in what exact confession (I might need a little help there) Pictures of each outfit will be coming soon! Let's get started!

Added info: Most of the second confessional outfits are worn in 17:44 in the Werk! Room after the goyls get out of drag! So, I'm guessing that the confessionals with the intro outfits come first, then the second outfits the first day. Also, I'm guessing that maybe each work day ends with a confessional? At 27:19, many of the girls are wearing their boy outfits that are also in some confessionals. Either that, or they re-wore boy-clothes a few times.

EDIT! I've made a 2nd! Find it here:http://www.reddit.com/r/rupaulsdragrace/comments/1brhmm/episode_2_confessional_notes/

This is all a rough find-and-report, I'll do additional run-throughs for more precise timelines.

EDIT: When the confession outfit is shown past an hour into the episode, the time stamp will look like (hour:minute:second) Untucked outfits are marked with a **UT** and marked with the time shone on Untucked, and every timestamp to the right of a 'UT' means that it was shown on Untucked multiple times. 

Unrelated, but while I'm on this episode and taking notes on it,  I just remember what first sold me on Jinkx was when she burst into the Silver lounge and purred in her best exaggerated Telanovela accent ""HOO JOO CAHHLING MEEEDIIOOCRRRE?!"" That, my dears, is when I knew Jinkx would serve it up for any acting challenge, especially if they had to do an accent.

Enjoy, because that sure as hell took me a long time to get through, and that's just the rough run-through."	t5_2t3or	True

  I have never done drag, because I lack poise and grace. I do know many drag queens. When I was 18 and just venturing out into the very limited gay venues in South Carolina I was scared and lonely and confused. It was drag queens like Samantha Hunter, and Dorae Saunders, and The Lady Chablis that took me in and made me feel welcome, and loved, and just made me feel GOOD ENOUGH. I cherish the memories of wild road trips with trunk loads of drag. The absolute fun I had with my friends in countless crammed gay bar dressing rooms is something I well never forget. I am who I am today because of the love and kindness those goddesses gave me.
  All that being said....HONEYS...I have met and encountered drag queens so vicious and despicable that my dick wanted to tuck itself in my butt hole and and all the hairs on my body just wanted to go up to Jesus! I remember those nasty queens. They were walking nightmares. I am telling you all here today I get the same heebie-jeebies every time Co Co opens her mouth.
  Her dry tears on the latest episode of UnTucked just chilled me to the bone! I honestly believe there is some nasty stuff going on in that head. She sends up all of my red flags and then just rips them to shreds and burns them! I would not want her to be my friend. I would not want her to be my neighbor. I wouldn't even want to be in the same check out line as her. I have seen queens like her over and over again and again. They thrive on drama and hurt feelings. They are emotional vampires! They suck everyone around them into a tornado of deceit and self loathing.
  CoCo is not FIT to win this title. Absolut should not give her money for a tour. She DOES NOT represent the love and joy of drag.
  That's my honest opinion. Please don't downvote me into Reddit oblivion or ban me from this wonderful subreddit!"	t5_2t3or	True

~I remember watching Drag U, when RuPaul was talking to one of the biological women, that this particular woman needed to ""bring out the drag queen"" that lies inside of her. I think this ideology and thought process can be used in every situation, with every sex, every walk of life, and every person. I kind of wanted to reinforce our drag mother's thoughts, and put in my own two cents. 

So here I go:

I am a person who is at first very closed up, very introverted and not *super* willing to talk to others. I have created a drag name for myself, for whenever I choose to do drag. Whenever I look to draw inspiration or strength, I think of my drag-self. I am sometimes weak, and shy, but being a drag queen you cannot be either of those things. The drag queen that lies inside of you, should bring out the best of you, and should bring you strength when you are not.

Sharon Needles was quoted saying how Aaron (her boy counter part) is very sensitive, however Sharon herself is very insensitive. Beyond the point that being insensitive is good or bad, Sharon uses her drag to demonstrate and changes the things that she can't change when she is not in drag.

So when you are in times of doubt, or times of struggle, nervousness or weakness, use the drag queen inside of you, and know you are FIERCE, SICKENING and.. bitch... you BETTA WERK.

Don't let anyone bring you down, or let you feel lesser than, because your drag queen-self is always with you, and should always be a reminder to what a glamazon you are."	t5_2t3or	True

If I missed you, misspelled something terribly, or you just want to add a video or say something nice to me, feel free to message me anytime! And remember, even if you didn't submit an introduction, you still have until this Friday to submit a lipsync video. After Sunday evening, submissions are **closed**. First category is Queens' Choice, so pick your favorite lipsync tune and show off.

Oh,and ladyboys and girls? **Don't** fuck it up.

Enjoy!

(And try not to throw *too* much shade, okay? *Okay.*)

**Edit** **for** **important** **reminder** : It had been stated at some point in one of the pre-show posts that in order for it to be a lipsync video, you shouldn't overlay the music*. We have to be able to tell you are lipsyncing and not singing then replacing the sound, which is far easier than lipsyncing, in terms of making your video line up. Please consider this when making your lipsync videos, and if anyone who's already turned one in wants to replace it, go for it.

*Also, Thatleafeon mentioned something to me that may be perfect. If you can't hear the music in your video well, so want to do an overlay, that's fine, BUT you must also upload at least a segment of raw footage as ""proof."" Now everyone can sound awesome but also prove they were syncing. Yay, everyone is happy! (And as far as I'm concerned, only I have to see the proof video at time of upload. If anyone calls shenanigans I'll link it, but I think you should all take my word for it. Trust your host, people!)"	t5_2t3or	True

I didn't like her watching the season because of the whole Coco fued. It just frustrated me, that there was such a big wind up, with the TINIEST fizzle of a result. But since Alyssa got eliminated, I realised is was just the orange lady I hated - coco. I also though her jokes were DREADFUL the first time I saw them. But after re-watching the entire season again, I CRACKED UP!! (I'm laughing now just thinking about Alyssa writing the roast speech. *oh no I can't say that! Giggles*

-I think Tammie Brown gets too much praise

-I think Jujubee is overrated and she got way too far in season two

-I feel Raven was way more bitchy than Tyra

-Tyra deserved to win her season

-Tatianna was not that bitchy and I feel like she's undeserving of the hate she gets

-The hate fest against Serena ChaCha in Untucked was unnecessary and completely uncalled for. 

-Jinkx fans are way too protective of her. Another queen says something slightly negative about her on the show and her fans freak out. She's definitely my favorite to win, but her fans can get a bit annoying.

Did Raja save her best looks for the end of the season? No.

Did Sharon save her best looks for the end of the season? No.

Did Nina, Manila, Yara, Ongina, Chad, Raven and all of those other popular queens ""save their best looks for last""? No.

Those bitches looked FIERCE from Day 1 of filming to the end. They may have had some outfits that looked better than others, but they always looked great, kept it interesting, and were always near the top of the pack from the beginning of the season. There was no discernible effort on their part to keep things low-key until later in the show.

I've been watching this show since the very first day it aired, and this is only season I've seen people start using the ""she's saving her best look"" excuse. Oh please. No successful and talented queen wants to risk looking boring before her audience, and especially not before the judging panel. So I'm not buying that excuse anymore. AFAIC, if you can't stand out by the third episode, then you're probably not going to stand out at all."	t5_2t3or	True

Apparently, RuPaul gave the wrong info to the interviewer [which Willam was quick to point out](https://twitter.com/willambelli/status/294638291200917504). **Willam had been trying to get out since Episode 2 by ~lying~ to the girls that he's had a laptop, since he had an off site Broadway show running at the same time as RuPaul's Drag Race was in production**. 

RuPaul herself was *misinformed*, and since then [Willam has been RuPologized by World of Wonder. They're sorry about the whole misunderstanding](http://ohnotheydidnt.livejournal.com/75011853.html?thread=13312637453#t13312637453).

Does anyone else feel like Detox really isn't TRYING to win? For several weeks now, she's been pretty underwhelming - just doing barely enough to coast from challenge to challenge. I'm starting to get the feeling that she might just be on the show for exposure, and plans to catapult off of name recognition alone. Kind of the way Willam did - because let's be honest - Willam did NOT need to win season 4, and is right up there with Sharon now as two of the most recognizable and successful queens post Drag Race. The difference with Willam, however, is that she actually did turn it out 90% of the time in her challenges, and has enough personality to propel herself to the moon and back.

She was not perfect, she read and she throwed shade all over the place (Just ask Jade). But in my opinion, her reads were always part of the game. And every time she got a shitty role (The crossdressing uncle) or an even shittier partner (Cof, Coco in the singing challenge, cof) Alyssa still delivered, and did her best.

So I was just thinking: Coco is all happy about sending her home on that lip sync, and feeling that she finally got ""closure"".
 I am sorry, but can you imagine how awesome it would be if Alyssa gets the crown? Then Coco might have to think that for many fans, she was the one who appeared to be shady. Also, I have a twitter list for queens, and after every episode, Coco was just ready to read and fight with fans (Particularly after the ""What's a Little Edie?"" failure in Snatch Game). Alyssa was nicer, and she even tweeted the ridiculous apology to Katy Perry (I mean she was horrible but so have been many).

All I am saying is: Alyssa, you came, you read, you knew reading was a game. I can't believe you put up with Coco and didn't hid her highlighter from her.

[IN SHORT: Now I really want Alyssa to win.](http://imgur.com/ACtVQSQ)

Edit: I just remembered that call with her dad and yes, that just makes my point stronger. She won my heart. "	t5_2t3or	True
1366254038.0	1ckyeu	/r/RuPaulsDragRace letter-writing campaign about the editing in this season	ForestfortheDraois	49	14	62	"**Note**: This will be ongoing for a few days to a few weeks.  Please save the link if you want to contribute because I'd like to keep this idea to one thread only.

As mentioned in prior threads, I'd like to spear-head a project to write a letter to the producers of this seasons drag race about the poor editing and the negative direction the show seems to be taking.  In a response I will be outlining a rough draft for the letter and asking for more specific points from you guys.

First, I would like to secure with the mods of /r/RuPaulsDragRace that is okay to mention the sub-reddit in the letter.  My intention is to introduce us and how we know each other and less to speak on behalf of the whole sub-reddit.  I will not be submitting the letter until it's been proofed by the community at least once but likely several times and would encourage mods to reign in anything they do not want to see addressed in the letter that links to this community.  My last intention with this project would be to besmirch anyone's name.

Secondly, this letter is not going to be toned in anger or disappointment.  It is a constructive criticism on how we feel about the editing, the way certain queens were portrayed, and what we would like to see in the future.  

I will send the final copy in with signatures from this community, whether by handle, real name, drag name, or all three.  Please indicate if you agree with the letter when I submit the final draft below.

Lastly, I at one point was going to be an English major but it's been many years and it never materialized.  I would appreciate any editing people can offer and acknowledge that the structure of the letter could be done better."	t5_2t3or	True

Here's my my reasoning- more than a few times when Jinkx has been on top and Roxxxy has too, Roxxxy has seemed to take it for granted that she was number 2 to Jinkx's number 1, but it has looked to me that she has been 3rd to Alaska's 2nd(like the Snatch Game and the Telenovela).

So, what do you gurlz think?

With season 5, all of the portions of the show where we get to know the queens (workroom gossip, runway voice-overs, simple mini-challenges, and Untucked) have all been severely edited or cut out altogether. Also, the challenges have become self-reverent and referential; although I LIVED for the untucked lip-synching and the No RuPaulogies ballet, don't those sorts of challenges essentially halt the natural occurrence of any more of those delicious moments? Could incidents like the Mystique Summers explosion (BITCH, I am from CHICAGO) or the MiMi Imfurst WWE Lip-synch possibly happen on this latest season of Drag Race, where every possible source of conflict has already been scripted (e.g., Coco/Alyssa controversy, Monica's ""secret"")?

But obviously Ru doesn't mind that sort of stuff--I mean Sharon has performed in KKK/Nazi constume, Alaska's been peed on onstage, Detox [can be very out there] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYeC7cy8l_8), a lot of them have done porn, a lot of them have been to jail.

So my question is do you think Ru would ever draw the line for PR reasons? Like do you think he would ever think that a queen's behavior reflects too poorly on the RPDR franchise? Because on other reality TV shows a bad past can get you disqualified and bad behavior can get you erased from the show/never mentioned by the show. 

So do you think that Ru would ever not consider someone because they're too racy, or stop acknowledging a queen because of her actions? Or do you think since they're drag queens all is fair game?"	t5_2t3or	True

The more I see from the posts you guys keep putting up of her performing, the more I realize this bitch is fierce! I liked her in the beginning because she seemed funny and quirky, but after looking at all of these performances both live and lip sync, I realize that this odd looking little man (because lets face it, he is odd looking) makes a beautiful woman, and has no end of talent, both musical and dramatic... not to mention how funny she can be.  I'm putting some serious money on Jinkx this season.

Also, is logo not doing the Fantasy drag team this season? I never got an email about it."	t5_2t3or	True

1359659069.0	17n7ad	[SPOILERS] Crunching Numbers on Number of Episodes vs. Number of Queens: Somebody's in TROUBLE.	dilettwat	32	3	26	"**Note on Spoilers: This is gleaned ONLY from stuff that Logo has officially released. No rumors here, just analysis.**

Follow me here:

Episode 1 has 14 queens.

Episode 2 has 13 queens.

Episode 3 has 12 queens.

...and so on, until you hit Episode 6, which should have 9 queens.

Now, Logo has released the [episode-and-judge pairings](http://www.logotv.com/sweepstakes/SeasonV_TwitterSweeps.pdf) (PDF). We know now that the Episode 6 judges are LaToya and the Pointer Sisters. That makes me think that this would be the logical episode for the singing challenge.

But our [singing-challenge screenshot](http://dilettwat.typepad.com/.a/6a017d3f6e48be970c017ee7a04274970d-800wi) from the opening flashes of Episode 1 only showed eight queens, not nine.

Also of note: since its inception, the Snatch Game has always been played with nine girls. It didn't matter that seasons 2, 3, and 4 all had a different number of episodes; the episode with nine queens remaining has always been the Snatch Game. Set as Episode 5 this season, though (again, from the episode-and-judge pairings), means that there should be ten queens in this year's Snatch Game.

In summary: assuming one elimination per episode,

**Episode 5 mathematically has 10 queens, but usually only has 9**, and

**Episode 6 mathematically has 9 queens, but only 8 appear** in the trailer screenshot.

So here's my crazy theory:

**Episode 3 or 4 is going to be a double-elimination.** Will it be planned and announced, or will two queens fail so badly that Ru decides to send them both home? That, we don't know.

How does that work out for the rest of the episodes, though? Well, we know that there are 12 regular-competition episodes, a clip show 13th, and the finale is number 14.

So, what if it goes like this?

Episode 1 has 14 queens.

Episode 2 has 13 queens.

Episode 3 has 12 queens.

Episode 4... let's call this our double-elimination. 11 queens enter, 9 queens leave.

Episode 5, Snatch Game, has 9 queens like every other season.

Episode 6, the singing challenge, has the 8 queens in the teaser screenshot.

Episode 7 has 7 queens.

Episode 8 has 6 queens.

Episode 9 has 5 queens.

Episode 10 has ...5 queens again. This is the Carmen/Kenya Put-a-Straight-Guy-In-Drag comeback episode.

Episode 11 has 4 queens. It's the Ball challenge.

Episode 12 has 3 queens. It's the music video. Winner revealed at the finale, of course.

Episode 13 is the clip show, and Episode 14 is the Reunion/Winner-Reveal.

What do you think? Did I miscount something, or are we looking at a double-elimination episode very, very soon?"	t5_2t3or	True

I've seen this question asked a few times and I usually write a lengthy response to try and explain the phenomenon of Alyssa stans.  I thought maybe we could just have a discussion about it to refer to when someone asks!  Here is my little write up about her.

**Always and Forever: Alyssa Edwards!**

Alyssa is a cult hit.  There hasn't really been another Queen I can easily compare Alyssa to on the show, yet.  I'm going to try and break down the aspects where we *can* compare Alyssa to other queens.  Then I'll explain where we can't compare her, and that's where the magic really starts.

**Aesthetic**

Purely judging a book by its cover, it doesn't seem Alyssa has much to offer beyond her beauty.  She is a stunning queen, but her style doesn't always let show that off.  Alyssa is an above-average painter; she's got a good eye for colours and sometimes shapes.  She isn't a damned seamstress, though.  She'd do well making friends with Raven for a hand in styling, since she seems to want to have a ""dark lady"" look sometimes.

From an aesthetic perspective, Alyssa compares to many of the other ""just pretty"" queens.  Unlike Rebecca and Tatianna, Alyssa never wore *tragic* makeup, nor did she look cheap.  I guess she compares best in this category to Carmen Carerra.  She has an aesthetic, but it's not always something to write home about.

**Talent Portion**

Alyssa is a magnificent dancer, but as we've seen, she does not excel in singing, acting or (scripted) comedy.  Rare is a triple-threat on Drag Race, Willam and Shangela are arguably the only real ones we've seen thus far.  That's another discussion.  Many are the queens who are **awesome** at one thing, but mediocre or terrible at most others.

This is why the overly ironic ""Acting"" segment on the most recent Alyssa's Secret was funny.  It's campy humour; Self-depreciating, over-the-top, absurd.

**Rivalries**

Before there was CoLyssa/PissyCo, there was Sharon vs PhiPhi, Raja vs Shangela, Raven vs Tati, Everyone vs Rebecca.  In the long run, the fans *tend* to favour the queen who seems less invested in the feud, or less affected by it.

Alyssa was like an inverse of Coco.  Coco was soooo bothered by Alyssa.  Comparing that to other queens.  Phi2 and Tati especially became highly emotionally invested in their feuds.  Alyssa continued to engage Coco's drama, but she rarely lost her cool.

It was the competition itself that really pulled Alyssa apart.  Coco certainly tried to make it seem like it was all about Coco, but Alyssa had lost her cool **because of the judges**.

**Personality**

This is where we meet the nuances that seal the foundation of Alyssa stans across the world.

I think it was Jinkx that said, ""She's just a goofy, fun person.""  That sums up Alyssa in a nutshell.  Alyssa makes her own fun where other people find none.  She seems to love laughing, and makes herself giggle far more often than your average person.  She strikes me as living in a world of rainbows and unicorns far more than Jade Jolie ever did, no t no shade!

Alyssa is a self-contained accidental comedy.  What's so unusual, and fascinating about her, is that Alyssa seems to be *fully aware* of this fact.  She knows she's a goof.  She embraces her awkwardness.  This is incredibly endearing to those of us who recognize our own awkwardness and try to live with it anyway.  Alyssa is confident enough not to have to lament about weirdness, like Alaska, Jinkx and Sharon all have(*).  She really just seems to be happy in her own ~~shoes~~ballerina slippers.

(*) - I just wanna say that I am not trying to say something bad about Alaska, Jinkx and Sharon here.  I identify with all of them, in their oddball identities.  It's a part of the story they tell, though, and it isn't part of the story Alyssa tells.  It's an interesting difference, to me.

Paraphrasing my favourite comment about Alyssa from reddit:

""She always rubs her hands together when she laughs.  I can't see her hands in this clip but I know she's doing it, the cheeky monkey!""

Alyssa has a lot of odd mannerisms.  Her mirror-faces (which are seen just as often when no mirrors are present), pointing where she's going on the runway, her *dressage horse* walk.  She also has a lot of catchphrases which are just as odd as her mannerisms.

Alyssa brings up some Poe's Law feelings.  Does she know she's odd?  Maybe she does, and she doesn't give a fuck.  Maybe she does, and she's putting on a show.  Maybe she has no idea and she really does live entirely inside her own kaleidoscopic mind!  Maybe she's a big dork because she teaches kids for a living and that's how she relates to them.

Whatever the answer is, Alyssa brings us to a world of campy delight.  Logo seems to be figuring out that's what we like about her, if the recent Alyssa's Secret means anything.

The magic of Alyssa is not now she compares to the other queens, it's how she doesn't.  While we've seen many iterations of camp in Jinkx, Pandy, Sharon, Alaska, (all the queens really), Alyssa's camp harkens back to a figure like Little Edie.  She lives in a world we cannot see, and it's fabulous.  Watching Alyssa gives us a tiny peephole into that fabulous world, and we relish that experience.

I'll leave off with some of Alyssa's one-liners, and [the unofficial theme song of this subreddit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOC_VGuc6Sc).  One-liners are a quick way to the heart of a Drag Race fan!

&gt; He was the one backstabbing me behind my back!

&gt; What the hell you squirpin' like a chirpin' like a bird!

&gt; Sit yo' ass down and shut the hell up, BITCH!

&gt; Sorry, Mr. Cameraman~

&gt; Not ohn tonoiiight!

&gt; I don't get cute; I get drop-dead gorgeous.

&gt; Get a grip, get a life, and *get over it*.

&gt; Awlroiiight.
