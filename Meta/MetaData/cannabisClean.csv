1290776458.0	ec1jx	"The DEA list of ""facts"" supporting why drugs should be illegal - these ""facts"" are almost entirely fabrications, lies, and unsubstantiated claims. What will it take to get sensible drug policy in this country?"	TroutM4n	341	41	95	"Here is the [link to the DEA ""Speaking out against drug legalization""](http://www.justice.gov/dea/demand/speakout/index.html) page. Here is a breakdown of their ""facts"" about drug use. . . .

:Fact 1: We have made significant progress in fighting drug use and drug trafficking in America. Now is not the time to abandon our efforts.
-Do I really need to quote statistics proving this to be incorrect? [Yes, yes I do.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_Enforcement_Administration#Impact_on_the_drug_trade)
-
:Fact 2: A balanced approach of prevention, enforcement, and treatment is the key in the fight against drugs.
-I'd say that education is the main requirement to reducing hard drug use. [Telling people ""No because I said so"" is just going to make many people do it anyway out of spite and ignorance.](http://psychology.wikia.com/wiki/Deviant_behavior)
-
:Fact 3: Illegal drugs are illegal because they are harmful.
-If that were true, then almost no pharmaceuticals would be available for people to use. [Legally prescribed medications can be incredibly harmful when used improperly](http://www.prescriptiondrugabuse.us/statistics-facts.html) - (that's once again where education comes in).
-
:Fact 4: Smoked marijuana is not scientifically approved medicine. Marinol, the legal version of medical marijuana, is approved by science.
-[This is one incredibly asinine statement. To claim that the plant this medication is based off of has no medical benefits is ridiculous.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_cannabis)
-
:Fact 5: Drug control spending is a minor portion of the U.S. budget. Compared to the social costs of drug abuse and addiction, government spending on drug control is minimal.
-FLAMING BULL SHIT - [Click here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_Enforcement_Administration#Budget)
-
:Fact 6: Legalization of drugs will lead to increased use and increased levels of addiction. Legalization has been tried before, and failed miserably.
-Well no, actually - [see Portugal, where all drugs have been decriminalized and they have 60% of the per capita usage rates America has](http://stopthedrugwar.org/speakeasy/2009/apr/06/decriminalization_huge_success_p)
-
:Fact 7: Crime, violence, and drug use go hand-in-hand.
-No, actually -  Crime, violence, and Prohibition go hand in hand. Alcohol prohibition taught America this with the rising of organized crime.
-
:Fact 8: Alcohol has caused significant health, social, and criminal problems in this country, and legalized drugs would only make the situation worse.
-This unsubstantiated and vague claim that providing a proven safer alternative to alcohol would increase ""problems"" in the country is just that - unsubstantiated.
-
:Fact 9: Europe’s more liberal drug policies are not the right model for America.

:They proceed to claim Holland's ""legalization"" of marijuana increased use of heroin. . . . [bullshit and Netherlands did not fully legalize.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_cannabis_by_country)
-
:Fact 10: Most non-violent drug users get treatment, not jail time.
-They claim that ""Truth is, only about 5 percent of inmates in federal prison are there because of simple possession"". That's because those busted for possession are in STATE PRISONS.

The one thing we have always had on our side is facts and science, but today it becomes blatantly clear that the government is unwilling to listen to facts or science or truth.

It's clear that sitting around and reading news articles on Reddit about how well Colorado and Washington are doing, hoping that things will keep going well just isn't going to end this fucking war on drugs. As of today, I have decided to get active, and start making an actual difference.

The sativa high is often characterized as uplifting and energetic . The effects of a sativa marijuana are mostly cerebral. They give a feeling of optimism and well - being, as well as providing a good measure of pain relief for certain symptoms. A few pure sativas are also very high in THC content. They are known to have a quite spacey, or hallucinogenic, effect. Sativas are a good choice for daytime smoking.


* **The Indica High :**

The indica highs are most often described as a pleasant body buzz. Indicas are great for relaxation, stress relief, and for an overall sense of calm and serenity. Marijuana indicas are also very effective for overall body pain relief, and often used in the treatment of insomnia. They are the late - evening choice of many smokers as an all - night sleep aid. A few pure indica strains are very potent in THC, and will cause the ""couchlock"" effect, enabling the smoker to simply sit still and enjoy the experience of the smoke. "	t5_2qhg2	True

Click for more details!	doodahdoodoo	103	6	2	"http://blog.norml.org/2012/02/09/8-states-may-legalize-marijuana-this-year-did-yours-make-the-list/

**Time is ticking...**

Do you want to hear about re-legalization efforts in 2014??  **HELL NO!**  We need to change things come November time 2012!

BUT to even get some of these measures on the ballot, the hard-working people that run these initiatives **need YOUR signatures and donations.**  

""What if my state isn't on the list?"" or ""what if I don't even live in the US?"" *You can still donate a few bucks to one of these organizations!*  For example, the Show-me Cannabis campaign in Missouri pays hard-working signature-gatherers 1 dollar for every signature they get.  It's an incentive to go out and be active in the political process!

How you can help:
1. REGISTER to vote!  Before you can sign a petition, you have to be registered in that state!

2. SIGN a petition.  It's easy!

3. DONATE if you have some spare change!  1 dollar, 10 dollars, 100 dollars, whatever; it will go to good people working for a good cause!

4. VOLUNTEER.  If you have some spare time or are curious as to see how the political process works, donate some of your time by collecting signatures!

5. SPREAD the good word!  I'm reaching out to over 14,000 people in this sub-reddit!  What will **you** do to help the cause??

If these petitions fail, and you did not sign one, then do not be pissed and wonder why we'll have to wait ANOTHER 2 YEARS to do this same old thing all over again!


tl;dr - **Before we can vote to RE-legalize, we need to sign these petitions before it's too late!**


ps - if we get ALL of these petitions on the ballot, then we can feel like [this](http://community2.metalreview.com/cfs-filesystemfile.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Components.ImageFileViewer/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles.editorials/FYSloth.bmp_2D00_550x0.jpg)

I need scientific research, and case law, related to blood THC content you can find that will help me back my statements up with verifiable data.	legalize2012	100	10	36	"EDIT: I know I put the 8th in the title, and I would have deleted and reposted if there were not already comments by the time this was pointed out.  This is going to happen on the 10th, which is actually a Thursday, not on the 8th which is the day I posted it and probably why that number showed up in there.

Draft text of bill proposed: http://e-lobbyist.com/gaits/drafts/269838 (it is only 6 pages so it is not a terrible read).

Basically, there are two aspects to this bill that do not hold water:

1. In 102.8 it uses a definition from 18-18-102 (included below) for ""Tetrahydrocannabinols"" which is excessively broad.  This, in my limited understanding, would also include the metabolites, or digested bits, of d9-THC, which are not, in any way, psychoactive and would not, in any way, affect a person's ability to drive.

2. 5 ng of THCs per ml of blood is not based on anything in reality.  THC is NOT like alcohol in the way that it limits your ability to operate equipment at very low levels.  The level of perceived limitation is also based heavily on the tolerance level of a user and therefore a ""hard"" limit is impossible to set.  The same issues exist with alcohol, with a user's tolerance level being a consideration, however alcohol, even in quantities less than 0.04% BAC, has been shown to negatively impact a person's ability to drive, while even moderate amounts of THCs in a person's blood has not been shown to be detrimental to a person's ability to operate a motor vehicle.  Small and moderate being relative to the person's tolerance level and not in any way related to a generic, one-level-fits-all definition.

18-18-102 (35) C.R.S: 
&gt; (35) (a) ""Tetrahydrocannabinols"" means synthetic equivalents of the substances contained in the plant, or in the resinous extractives of, cannabis, sp., or synthetic substances, derivatives, and their isomers with similar chemical structure and  pharmacological activity, such as the following: 

&gt;    (I) 1Cis or trans tetrahydrocannabinol, and their optical isomers;   
&gt;   (II) 6Cis or trans tetrahydrocannabinol, and their optical isomers;   
&gt;  (III) 3,4Cis or trans tetrahydrocannabinol, and their optical isomers  
  
&gt;(b) Since the nomenclature of the substances listed in paragraph (a) of this subsection (35) is not internationally standardized, ompounds of these structures, regardless of the 
numerical designation of atomic positions, are included in this definition.

I know there are states out there that had DUID laws at one point and that they were repealed.  I know that there are studies done that show a non-negative, and even borderline positive, correlation of cannabinoids in the blood to driving ability.  

I don't have a lot of time and need your help to collect as much data that would relate to the above two points, or driving under the influence of cannabis in general, as possible so that I can present the strongest argument possible.  I will even record it, at least audio, and share it back here with all of you.

If you are in Colorado and interested in going  I would be happy to car pool to the hearing.  If you are interested in hearing about legal issues in Colorado related to legalization send an email to info@Legalize2012.com and ask to be added to their mailing list.

This account not yet officially associated with their efforts, but I hope to be the online presence for them if I can demonstrate the value of having a strong online presence.  You guys can help me show them how amazing and useful reddit can be.  This war will be won through access to information and the truth, and by connecting to young voters and those who feel like ""there is nothing we can do"".  

Also, there is a legalization meeting scheduled for tomorrow.  If you are interested in the opportunity to vote for legalization in 2012 then show up and see what you can do to help further this effort.  Check out the http://info@Legalize2012.com/ website for the location and time of the meeting.

This is my first post, just hope it works and I do it right.

One of my dear dutch friends, who I went to university with some years ago, is into film-making. Currently he is working on a self-produced documentary called ""Hemp - The unknown plant"", in which he wants to state out the distinctiveness of the hemp plant in general.

Since this is a pretty big project and it isn't featured by any production company or whatsoever, he of course needs some help with the funding.
I told him about reddit and that people here would probably like the project and would show international support.

So please go and check out his indiegogo page, where he lists the crowdfunding. Every support gets something back, whether it is a DVD, a filmposter or something else. Please go and check it here: 

http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/hemp-the-unknown-plant

About the documentary.

The motivation behind the documentary is to show that hemp is capable of much more than only smoking it and getting high. During the history of mankind hemp has always been an extremely valuable crop for many cultures and is one of the oldest agricultural plants on the globe. Since more than 10.000 years now, hemp is used by humans and was never limited to its recreational use. But, the image has turned around completely in less than a 100 years. Today hemp is mainly seen as dangerous and illegal. Fortunately, the power of hemp and its uses are rediscovered slowly.

In the 21 century the image of hemp is still heavily influenced by its use as a recreational drug. Disinformation, propaganda, and simply ignorance led to an image of the plant that is outdated and very negative within the public notice.  

Hemp can play a crucial role for our future life. It has a lot of advantages compared to other crops we use today. But it still is a niche plant with a small acceptance. The film wants to change that.

There is currently a ASKREDDIT up inquiring into the reasons cannabis is still outlawed.  I wanted to respond to some of the myths that were being repeated in the first responses, but then I noticed this wiki article.  Compared to the pretty decent http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_cannabis#Short-term_effects    it really fails to stay neutral and seems to be generally ignorant of some of the most recent studies.  I think making sure the wiki pages on cannabis are pretty accurate is a very important part of educating the young folk on the facts and myths of cannabis use.  

In the first paragraph they mention ""On some topics, such as the drug's effects on the lungs, relatively little research has been conducted, leading to division as to the severity of its impact.""
The article generally fails to cite both sides of the issues with studies indicating the ""damages"" and ""harmlessness"" of cannabis.
So lets make this a community effort! Update the studies of this wiki page to feature both sides of the argument, and remember to cite.  

Here are some articles listing studies with full citations to help out the research:

1364114738.0	1awn9r	Emailed my Congressional Rep, Just Got a Response from her - Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D). 	HillZone	82	12	9	"&gt;Thank you for contacting me about the legalization of marijuana. I appreciate you taking the time to make me aware of your concerns on this important matter.

&gt;Recently, Washington and Colorado voted to legalize the recreational use of marijuana. Given the differences between state and federal law, it is clear we are in the midst of a national conversation about marijuana use and its legality. Legalizing marijuana would lower its price, widen its availability and increase the misuse of the drug, even when controls are in place. This adds a significant burden on the criminal justice system as more violations occur. Additionally, the tax revenues raised by regulating the drug would be offset by the higher social costs and public health risks.  

&gt;Part of the discussion on federal laws prohibiting marijuana use includes its various medical components. To date, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the only scientific and legally recognized body for brining safe and effective medications to the American public, has not found smoked marijuana to be either safe or effective medicine for any condition. Smoking marijuana has been found to be less effective than other legally available medicine. I support continued research on the medical uses of marijuana and examining if it can be available for medical professionals to legally prescribe if proven safe and effective. I look forward to further reviewing legalization initiatives with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and engaging in a productive debate. Please be assured that I will keep your comments in mind should legislation regarding the legalization of marijuana be brought to the floor of the House of Representatives.        

&gt;Thank you again for sharing your thoughts with me. Please stay in touch with me by visiting my website at  www.duckworth.house.gov , where you can sign up for my email list, access my voting record and get additional information on important issues facing our country. If I can be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.

So this is a typical response. She seems to be another corporate democrat and so I will not be voting for her. The only reason she got elected is because she got her legs blown off in Iraq, I'm just hoping she didn't suffer any brain damage. But I'm not sure when she says stuff like ""legalization adds a significant burden on the criminal justice system.""


My response:

&gt;Point 1: 
The first argument you made was that legalizing cannabis would increase availability and therefore increase use. This point has been widely debunked. In the Netherlands where cannabis is sold in coffeeshops, rates of use are about half that in the United States.  Additionally states that have passed MMJ laws have seen lower rates of use among teens than states that have not. This is largely due to the forbidden fruit effect being taken away in a legal marketplace. 
Furthermore even if cannabis use increased, there is no evidence that health care costs would increase. This argument is another piece of propaganda by the crime-industrial-complex. They are using the cost models of alcohol and tobacco, which are vastly more dangerous than cannabis and thus it is not appropriate to apply their social or healthcare costs to marijuana – which as the DEA’s own administrative law judge Francis Young said in 1988 “is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man.”
&gt;A legal marijuana market would bring in $85 billion dollars per year in savings and additional tax revenue according to Harvard economist Jeffrey Miron. Even if you believe marijuana is harmful, it would hardly make sense to allow dangerous criminals to hold a monopoly on its sale.

&gt;Point 2: 

&gt;You stated that cannabis as medicine is not FDA approved. Please take the time to understand why this argument is fallacious.
Cannabis cannot be patented. The FDA does not regulate herbal products, rather they are in the business of approving patentable chemicals. In the U.S. herbal products are sold as dietary supplements in health food stores, and we accept that they can have beneficial medical effects, like multivitamins. But they do not need special approval from the FDA, they only need to say on their packaging that the FDA has not reviewed the claims (they can make structural or functional claims of general health benefits, but must say it is not intended to treat or cure any disease).
&gt;If the cannabis plant were patentable, a company would have a financial incentive to test it. They would put in the millions of dollars required to get cannabis through the FDA, but even if cannabis could be patented, no such company can currently exist as long as it remains a schedule I drug. 
&gt;You mentioned a desire for more research on the matter. However research is being routinely denied by NIDA, the National Institute on Drug Abuse which has a monopoly on the U.S. research supply -- which they only dispense for studies attempting to show the harms associated with it as they are an organization that classifies all illicit drug use as abuse.
&gt;The other issue is, what would this company be looking to show medically? There are dozens of ailments that cannabis can treat. They'd need to fund studies for each one. With millions in funding and the legal ability to research it would be approved for chronic pain, appetite stimulation, insomnia, muscle spasms, and nausea. This will not happen because the market cannot be cornered on a natural herb.

&gt;Let's review:
&gt;The FDA argument is fallacious:
&gt;1.	We can't do enough research on it thanks to NIDA/Schedule I.
&gt;2.	No company can patent the plant so there will never be enough money to fund research.
&gt;3.	It is not the job of the FDA to regulate plants; they don't regulate herbs or dietary supplements.

&gt;The increased use/increased harm argument is fallacious:
&gt;1. Evidence shows places where cannabis is tolerated have significantly lower rates of use.
&gt;2. Cannabis is safer than alcohol and tobacco, and its social costs are negligible in comparison.

&gt;I hope in the future you will avoid using fallacious arguments like these which have been sold to the public by vested financial interests in the drug treatment industry, and others in the crime-industrial-complex.

&gt;I hope you will reconsider your support for this issue as I have explained why your previous concerns are based on misinformation and false premises. I understand that you are busy and rely on information from others, but in this area you like many other Congressional representatives have been horribly misled. I welcome you to join the growing movement to support a safer society and a more rational approach to marijuana regulation.  

&gt;Thank you and I look forward to reading your response.

The Hemp Revolution, the one that Jack Herer among many other people dreamed of can now be upon us. Replacements to plastics, chemical paper, construction material, hempseed oil, cotton that requires a lot pesticides and fertilizers to grow, you can even make a car out of it Henry Ford's Hemp car was posted to Reddit a few weeks ago. This is why I think we have to fight harder than ever because the powers that be do not want this revolution.
