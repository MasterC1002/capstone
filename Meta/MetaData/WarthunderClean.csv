I've been playing this game for about a month now and I'm really loving it. However, I have been having some framerate issues while playing, and I don't think I should be. I am constantly getting 20-25 FPS, sometimes dipping down to 15 FPS while in-game. I tried to looking for an option (+Google) to change the graphics settings, but I couldn't find a tab for it. Could someone point me in the right direction? I know at the start-up of the game, it automatically adjusts the settings due to my video memory, but I don't feel that is accurate.

1364391218.0	1b3x1h	Handy little FAQ!	wokasmasher	173	15	72	"Here I'll try to link or explain the most commonly asked questions I see floating around on this sub.

* **What Joystick do you use/ is best**?

This one pops up a lot, and depends on what your budget can handle. Manymanymany people use the [Logitech Extreme 3d Pro](http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Extreme-Joystick-Silver-Black/dp/B00009OY9U) as seen in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/1b3hp8/alright_pilots_whats_the_best_joystick_for_this/) thread and [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/1978aq/thinking_about_getting_a_joystickcontroller/) and [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/17v2oo/joystick_recommendations/). Obviously, opinions differ, so find something in your price range, do your research and get a tensile sense of the death you are unleashing.

* **Why is my joystick pulling all over the place?**

This was answered nicely by *KamikazeSexPilot* :

It's the torque from your engine. Some aircraft do it more than others, the german aircraft especially are bad for this. To fix this you need to set your aileron trim. Basically what you do is hold your joystick in the position that makes you fly absolutely straight, then press ""page up"" and it will set your trim, you can see the values in the bottom left when you set it. You can reset it with ""/""
Japanese aircraft are notorious for wanting to pull up, so you need to set the elevator trim to 20% to get some of them to fly straight. Setting the trim after one of your wings has been damaged can really help in flying straight as well! It's frustrating flying the German aircraft because most if not all of them don't even have aileron trim!! But it goes away when you get up to a high enough altitude/speed.
tl;dr **It's the torque from the engine, set your trim with ""Page Up""**


* **How do I earn money/gain exp faster**?

*MURDER*. Thats really the only answer. You can go premium and get exp/lions faster, but you have to deliver souls to the reaper to earn your next plane. Whether it be ground or air targets, kill them. Kill them all. Historical Battles (HB) and Full Real Battles (FRB) will both earn you more exp/lions per kill, but keep in mind they have *vastly* different playstyles than arcade. I recommend you watch the [dogfighting instructional videos]( http://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/10709-dogfighting-instructional-videos/) (same as linked on the sidebar) for more murdering tips. You can, on Domination maps, land on the airfields for a cool 2-3k lions. On the subject of landing, should you ever lose your engine and don't want to die a glorious fiery death, you can try to find an open field (or even better, an airfield) and gently set your plane down on it. Try to keep your airspeed under 230 kph (approx 143 mph) and avoid houses and shacks because that is a warcrime. Please note that landing on the enemies airfield will not get you repaired. Its more like ~~plowing his/her sister while looking him/her in the eyes~~ thumbing your nose at the enemy than anything.

* **Whats the difference between all of these ammo types**?

This question should be eliminated by the new patch in-game, but for your convenience

I- Incendiary. Burns things, like fuel and oil, and can bone you hard in a HB match when it burns all 20m of fuel you brought..

HE- High Explosive. Good against soft targets, like ~~your mom~~ fighters and engines.

AP- Armor piercing. Good against ground targets (not the invincible pillbox) and heavily armored air targets (IL2, etc)

T- Tracer. Lets you see where your rounds are going. Almost essential in HB and FRB. As a bonus, it can freak out pilots and cause them to Sonny Bono into a mountain.

Those are the basics, and can be combined in alot of ways. Please note that there are some new ammo types out that I have not tested, namely the japanese IAI (Immediate Action Incendiary). If you know what the hell this is or historically was, please comment below!

* **Which plane/tree is best**!?

All of the trees excel at certain gametypes and levels. For instance, the German tree is terrible at lower tiers compared to the US tree (US vs Germany is the current HB mission). However, at tier 6 (T6) and tier 7 (T7), the Germans get their first BF 109s and Do 217s, and can take on the American Airacobras and A-20s on an equal footing. I cannot cover every plane in every tree, so if you have any questions regarding goodness of planes, feel free to comment below and I'm sure one of the very many helpful Warthunder pilots can help you out.

*Added by Familyengie*
Some clarification of the Russian and Japanese trees which weren't mentioned:
Japanese planes have no armor. Their guns, however, are relatively accurate. The planes are some of the most maneuverable in the game, the rank 2 Ki-43 excels at turnfighting.
Flying with Japan, expect to be frustrated by having your pilot and fuel tank shot. A very large lack of armor there. Their bombers are cool, having the largest in the game, a 20mm cannon on the rear of each heavy bomber, and the ability to have pretty large payloads. When you get the Zero, you will have fun. The Zeros (minus the navy one) in the game are fantastic. Fast and strong. Still have a lack of armor though.
Russia has flying tanks. The early SU2 does not die and if you can fly evasively, your gunner will take out targets for you. Russian planes have the best armor in the game, and most of them come with cannons from early on. This combination makes Russian planes powerful throughout the game. When you get the IL-2, you're going to have fun.
Summary:
Japan has low armor, high speed, 20mm on every heavy bomber, and very agile. Lousy early and mid tree planes, makes things frustrating.
Russia has high armor, high firepower, not extremely agile though, cannons on early fighters, agile bombers, and flying tanks. Strong tree throughout the game, I believe.

* **What should I put crew points in/how do I get crew points**?

I'll go over crews in general here, because it's a little bit tricky. You get crew points for murdering/capping things. I'm not exactly sure of the ratio for exp gained to crew points gained, but I've found that it is far easier to gain crew points with my premium planes than with peasant biplanes. 

**Crew Slots**
Each slot represents the folks needed to get a plane up and murdering. Pilot, gunners, mechanics, etc. Each time you buy a plane, the game asks if you want to put it in service. You spend lions to train the crew in the selected slot to operate the plane. This means that while any crew slot can operate any plane, you have to pay for each additional crews training, and noone has the lions to pay for that.
You also have to keep in mind that bombers and the various attackers have gunners chilling in the back, and you have to spend crew points keeping them experienced. It is usually a good idea to have different slots for different roles. For example, my Level 4 setup for USA is 

1st Slot: P40 (Fighter)
2nd Slot: SBD Dauntless (Dive bomber)
3rd Slot: PBY Catalina (Tanky Troll Torpedoer)
4th Slot: F2A Buffalo (Fighter)

etc. etc. You'll notice I have 2 bombers, and 2 fighters, so I can adapt my playstyle as the situation demands.



I'll try to give a quick and nasty on the various skills here.

**Pilot Tab**

Keen vision - Lets you identify enemies from a further distance. Most useful in HB.

Visibility - I *think* this is compared to the enemies Keen Vision, meaning that you'll be a little black fleck for a longer time before God comes down and puts a handy ""Shoot me"" sign on you.

G-Tolerance - Points here mean your pilot won't black out from G-forces, with the benefit of being able to turn tightly without 3/4s of your screen being taken from you.

*Added by NOACeulemans* G-force tolerance is very important in all three modes. If you push your pilot too hard and pull high-G maneuvers a lot and for extended durations (like during turnfighting or loopings, or Immellman's and Split-S maneuvers), your pilot will 'black out' and your screen will become dark, but that's not the worst part yet. If this happens, your plane will become less agile as your pilot lacks the strength to pull on his flight stick as hard as before. Honestly, among the pilot skills, it's the most important one.

Stamina - I haven't the foggiest, but apparently not implemented yet.

Vitality - How many rounds your pilot can take before becoming an interior paintjob. Again, apparently not implemented.

**Gunner Tab** 

No. of experienced gunners - Absofuckinglutely *imperative* if you have a bomber. A point here means that one gunner (if you have any) will be able to use the points you have put into gunner skills. I do not advise putting points here in a fighter slot.

Fire Accuracy - Affects how accurately your gunners will fire.

Fire Precision - *Not* the same as accuracy. Precise fire with an automatic weapon means short, controlled bursts, not Rambo/Arnold style rapid fire (aka spraynpray). Your gunner will fire a more sustainable, ammo friendly rate of fire with more points here (standard is 3-5 second burst, or the time it takes to say ""diemotherfuckerdie"")

Not quite sure about G-tolerence, stamina, and vitality for gunners, but I put points here anyway, even on a fighter slot, for qualification purposes.

**Ground Service**

Repair Speed - Affects how long it takes to repair your aircraft ingame on an airfield, and, with the appropriate (current plane level) Repair Rank, affects how long it takes after the match ends for your crew to repair the plane for free.

Repair Rank - Each point here corresponds to one tier. For example, 9 points in Repair Rank means you can use your Repair Speed effectively on a T9 plane.

Reload Speed - **PUT A SHITTON OF POINTS HERE FOR ARCADE** This corresponds to both in-air (in Arcade) and airfield reloads. Tired of waiting 30 seconds for your murderous death cannon to reload? Skeet your points all over this. 1 minute wait on your bombs? Pointspointspoints. This is, by far, the handiest skill to put points in, for Arcade mode. It's important in HB amd FRB as well, but arcade is all about putting bullets in faces, and this skill will decrease the time you spend playing pocket-pool.

Healing Speed - No clue. Maybe in a later patch they'll introduce pilot downtime, thus pissing everyone off, but as of right now I don't see a use.

**Qualification**

Get these. You spend a few thousand (depending on the planes tier) lions to get an instant boost to Keen Vision and Visibility for the Pilot tab, Fire Accuracy and Fire Precision for the Gunner tab, and Repair Speed and Reload Speed for the Ground tab. Keep in mind that it is only this slot that gets this qualification. If you move the plane to another slot, you will have to pay again for the boner-inducing bonus.


* **What in tarnation is up with all of this flap business?; or Flaps: How do they work?**

Answered by *davemanster*. Hurrah! 


Real pilot here, let me explain flaps.
1.Takeoff

* Flaps for normal takeoffs are not used (unless you are in a heavy plane such as a bomber... in real life larger and modern planes use flaps and slats).

* For short field takeoffs some flaps can be used and you rotate just above stall speed and stay at that IAS until the obstacle is cleared. Then slowly bring the nose down/speed up and retract the flaps.This allows for maximum climb over distance.

* Keep in mind for takeoffs using flaps allows your wings to generate more lift, allowing you to ascend sooner, but increases drag so they will slow you down.

2.Landing

* Flaps may or may not be used in landings, but generally are.

* Flaps might not be used for landings if you have a high crosswind component (flaps allows the wind to affect the wings to a greater degree), and you have plenty of runway available to use.

* Landing with no flaps will generally be at a higher IAS, causing more wear to the tires, and sometimes the gear (not simualted in WT, just food for thought)

* In general flaps are used for landings, they work as a speed break (allowing a steeper decent to the field) and create additional lift from the wings. This allows you to touchdown at a slower IAS which is both easier on the tires and gear, and will require less runway.

3.Combat flaps

* Simple; combat flaps increase the lift of your wings, allowing you to maintain control at slower speeds, and if you are in a steep turn, allow you to turn a little sharper. Bear in mind that flaps will increase drag in your airplane decreasing both your acceleration and maximum speed.

* In general, if you are at low speed, steep turns use them. As soon as you are no longer in that situation, raise them. Parasite drag is really bad for fighters!



I'll continue work on this as I come across more questions, and again, if you'd like to add something, pop it into the comments!

I'd also like to recommend that you hop on the Warthunder RDDT teamspeak. This has greatly increased the playability of the game for me, and will hopefully do the same for you. You'll find some folks to squad up with so you can trick that bastard Yak/109/Zero/Cobra into a deathtrap. In case you missed it:

1374030918.0	1igmie	Why Arcade has gone backwards since 1.29	dmh_longshot	135	17	204	"Below is a list of issues that are seriously detracting from Arcade battles. I describe what they do, how they harm gameplay and how I suggest improvements could be made.  Most of these have been introduced in either 1.29 or 1.31, hence the title of this thread.

* Ground Strike ""Gremlins"" (or as the Russians call them, ""Barabashka"", introduced in April).  This is a script that self-destructs ground targets, it activates in every Ground Strike game and it happens regardless of whether one or both teams are still flying bombers.  The last dozen or so targets on each team are nearly always destroyed by this script.  Its bad because it deprives bomber pilots of the ability to win the game for their team and earn income, and it makes a mockery of the battle up till that point.  Suggested fix: If this script is necessary, please make it activate only once 10 minutes of gameplay has passed _and_ 3 minutes since the last ground target was destroyed OR airfield bombed.  If a player kills another ground target or bombs the airfield, please disable the script with another 3 minute timer - give players a chance to win the game without the script taking over.

* Domination ticket bleed (introduced in 1.31).  This initially reduced gametimes to 5 minutes or less, and now its 10 minutes or less.  Domination games prior to 1.31 were often epic encounters, sometimes fought down to the last few planes on each team - that never happens anymore, the ticket bleed forces an early end.  Is there a need to force  all games to prematurely end like this, and deprive players of the ability to win the mission with desperate last-ditch comebacks against the odds?  If the intent was to force people to fight for the objectives because time's running out, it failed - teams instead race to establish an early lead and then sit back &amp; let the timer do the rest ... Suggestion:  Its not needed, it reduces the fun in the game, please remove it.  Failing that, please make the bleed much slower, and provide big lion-based incentives for people to risk their planes in capping runs on enemy airfields.  If the problem is the occasional situation where a team has pilots with lots of plane slots, put a hard cap of 4 spawns per game to ensure the playing field is level.  Ticket bleed is not a good addition to this game, it solves nothing, it makes gameplay worse.

* Bomb splash radius, nerfed in 1.29 and heavily again in 1.31.  Many bombers start out with 50kg bombs, which now need direct hits to destroy the most common ground target - tanks.  To do this you have to go in at low altitude, which means many bombers are totally unusable as they lack either the speed or agility to survive.  The splash radius may be considered ""historically accurate"", but for gameplay purposes in arcade the nerf has been detrimental.  Fewer bombers in the air has a trickle-down affect on other planes, resulting in gameplay thats less diverse and more slanted towards meaningless dogfights rather than winning the mission.  Suggestion: please restore it to 1.29 levels for arcade battles.

* Bombers &amp; cannon spam.  Over the last few updates, bomber DMs have become progressively weaker (as have fighters) and the number of cannon-equipped aircraft has increased.  With fast reloading times for cannon,  bombers higher than tier 5 or so have become flying coffins - its only viable to fly them in lower tiers.  This detracts from the depth and enjoyment of gameplay.  Its not just bombers either, due to cannon reload times fighters that use them are way more effective in AB than fighters with MGs, even though historically some of the MG-equipped fighters were superior because they were a more stable gun platform with a much higher ammo count.  Suggestion: historically cannons had limited ammo and a sharp recoil especially at larger calibers.  Please consider greatly increasing cannon reload times so that these weapons don't dominate all arcade battles, and introduce a much larger recoil such that mouse users have to fight to keep the planes on target.

* This last one isn't new, its more a case of something that's been missing from arcade ever since I started playing in 1.25, and that's rewarding teamwork.  Right now all the rewards go to players who kill other planes, with minimal lip service rewards for assists etc, or for playing to the misison's objectives.  The economy also rewards ""staying alive"", which is the antithesis of taking risks to win the battle for your team.  The result, as anyone who plays AB can verify, are trains of fighters jostling each other as they chase an isolated enemy.  It rewards selfish behaviour at the expense of your team.  Suggestion: Make assists &amp; criticals worth almost as much as kills, and show assists on the stats board.  In addition, please reward playing to the objectives: in Ground Strike provide high rewards for rescuing and conversely shooting/assisting bombers and ground targets, in Domination provide high rewards for rescuing fighters, for capping enemy bases or making enemy bases neutral (these last two are usually suicide missions and should be rewarded appropriately)."	t5_2uc6j	True

1363725328.0	1am6ns	Patch 1.29 summed up perfectly on war thunder forums.	keep_digging_watson	147	33	203	"This post was submitted by Aerial_Fury. In it he quotes Osirish and together they sum up the whole of 1.29 quite well. A bit long but worth a look.


Original quote by Osirish:

&gt;""I think that Gaijin need to look at themselves more closely. Who is making these design decisions? Customers, yes ""customers"", because ""players"" doesn't reflect accurately what we are, want the game to be fun. Isn't that the reason 99.9% have been playing WT? Gaijin, you want our money, and we'll happily pay if we are having fun and getting value for it. Game developers chose their career paths because they were gamers first. They want to make products that are fun too. Decisions that are made that remove the fun through cynical money grabs is not what customers want, or developers want to see in their games ... so again, who is making the decisions?
 
&gt;I'm an old man. I've been playing games since pong. I was getting jaded and WT gave me back what has been missing from most games in the last 10 years, fun. Patch 1.29 has now killed that for me too. I recently bought 3 months membership, because I was having fun. I bought the ultra-pack as a christmas present for myself because I was having fun. I put a lot of trust into you because you were different and I believed that you knew what customers wanted. You weren't charging 50 euros for a single premium plane, while there was some grind, it was not beyond someone who was a casual player. There was little that was unachievable for a ftp customer over a premium player except speed of levelling.
 
&gt;I've been playing for a few hours, and I've read through this thread. Let me pre-empt a few things.
 
&gt;Why should I give the patch a chance and get used to it if I am not having fun? If it wasn't fun in the first 30 minutes, or the first 3 hours, it won't be fun after the first 30 hours. Do not disrespect me or others by saying we'll get used to it or that change is always resisted. All you are saying to me by suggesting I give the patch a chance is ... waste a day or two of your life in the faint hope that your pleasure centers will re-adjust and you'll suddenly agree with the changes and like them.
 
&gt;I don't give a crap about FMs or DMs in arcade mode. Purists and players who like simulations already have two game modes available for them. Casual players have one, and you're killing it. Arcade mode is about pure unadulterated fun. You have replaced that a mode that just isn't fun for a lot of us. Continuously calling it a Beta and to stop whining is another form of disrespect and downright idiocy. If something is not right in the Alpha, or Beta, then that is exactly the time to whine and QQ about it.
 
&gt;For those who are saying to stop QQing, that it is FTP and that no one forced us into spending money. If we didn't, you wouldn't have servers to play on. The way I see it, if you haven't spent money to support the development and infrastructure of the game yet, then why is your opinion more valid than those of us who have, surely it should be the other way around?
 
&gt;Premium is almost a requirement now, certainly if you are leveling crews and crew skills. Would I be right in saying that Gaijin are already planning to sell ""Lion Packs"" in the store? What has happened is that the income has been nerfed and the price of everything else has increased ... and you did raise the price of everything else. The only thing that you reduced was the repair costs of about 60% of the planes, the others remained the same or increased. Many are thanking you for lowering the repair costs, but they are not seeing the huge increase in the purchase of new planes, the huge increases in crew training, the increases in cost of ammunition and extra modules that have been added. I don't give a crap about repair costs decreasing by 2000 when my next plane is going to cost 1.5 million, or training the crew to ace is going to cost another million, or equiping it with ammo is going to cost another few hundred thousand. Am I the only one seeing this for what it is?
 
&gt;I own a lot of premium planes. You did one thing right by giving the ""gift"" planes premium bonuses .... but how many have noticed the nerfs on your other premium planes. Planes that were bought for real money to support the game, and that were bought on the basis of the bonuses they gave, have been nerfed too .... with no patch notes or warnings. Did you enjoy your Boomerang? Did you enjoy it so much you bought both of them although they were practically identical? Do you know that the income and xp bonuses on them have been nerfed, like the others? If someone buys something that is advertised as one thing and you then take that away after you have received their money .... is that not illegal with most products? Defending this by saying it is just a patch or is a beta is no defence.
 
&gt;Yes, I remember the out-cry after patch 1.27 ...  Customers were unhappy with patch 1.27 .... they were still complaining about it right up until patch 1.29 ... now that patch 1.29 is worse and people are saying ""go back to patch 1.27"" ...  is an indication or how F'd up patch 1.29 is, not validing that 1.27 was good. Every patch has made the game a little less fun. The 15 sec timer, OP Russian planes(ufos),  and the paper bombers were the original complaints ... now we have a whole new set. This does not make patch 1.27 good, it is saying that people would rather play a broken 1.27 than the current 1.29.
 
&gt;Trying to turn arcade mode into more of a realistic simulator is not working. You are removing the fun. Trying to force players into paying money by making it too tough to progress without it, might look good in the short term but will kill the game's potential in the long run.
 
&gt;1.29 has made me regret renewing my subscription. The nerfs to premium planes has made me regret buying them too. I play arcade, I play casually. I want to support this game, but you won't be seeing another penny from me until you make the game fun again. I do not want another grind fest. I do not want another publisher trying to nickel and dime it's customer base. I do not want the game to feel like work. Congrats on the X2 xp by the way ... now the game feels more like work, wonder where you got that idea from?
 
&gt;The gameplay itself ... Handling is much worse for most of the planes I flew today. Most matches are now ending with one side losing all it's aircraft because no one can stay alive long enough to bomb the targets, or when they actually managed to drop bombs, they missed. How crap dive bombing is now and that you have to practically go nose down to make the sight appear, or how bombers don't seem to have sights at all without using the bomb view. How bomber hunters like the Me410.A are now being out turned and out dived by their prey even when you took out one of their engines on the first pass and they somehow manage to get on your tail and keep up with you. How most players now seem to be flying russian planes for some reason (like it wasn't an issue before!). Maybe someone can put together a list of good things that came out of this patch because I can't?



Following Comment by Aerial_Fury:

&gt;""This. This post is well constructed with both LOGIC and REASON as well as an appeal to emotion. This post deserves more attention.
 
&gt;I agree with everything in that post but if I could add my own two cents:
 
&gt;A few people are saying the new damage model makes the game more ""rewarding"" and ""dynamic"". While these are both relative terms, I will try to construct an argument against it and hopefully you can see why I am so adamant against this mindset
 
&gt;The new damage model has given planes in arcade mode the ability to quickly (and I mean quickly) kill enemy planes. Planes have more vulnerable spots and even being nicked in the tail wing can make it impossible to fly let alone continue to fight and evade.
 
&gt;Now normally, this would be an ok change, especially to realism game modes and perhaps would even have been a good change to arcade mode if it were not for one glaring issue: THE EASE OF TARGETING IN ARCADE MODE. By this I am referring to the number of features in arcade such as mouse aim, aim reticule, lead reticule, etc.
Why is this a problem? Because it makes shooting down people TOO EASY. There is no skill, there is no reward. High damage combined with easy targeting is a TOXIC gameplay model (except for cod but that is not a dogfighting game).
High damage WORKS in realism modes because targeting is so hard. It takes skill and maneuvering ability to hit your shots. This is not the case in arcade (which is not a bad thing, the point of arcade is to make flying easier) and the reason high damage removes so much fun from the game.
 
&gt;1.29 has REMOVED dogfighting from arcade in the forms of turn fighting and energy fighting. Fights are over faster than people can react simply because they took 1 machine gun bullet to the tail pipe. The game is no longer about targeting an enemies engines or wings as it was in 1.27. Before, you positioned yourself perfectly on someones tail, aimed at the right spot and were rewarded for it. Now, you simply spray and hit whatever you can to completely immobilize them and you have won.
 
&gt;Sure 1.27 had problems with balance and such. BUT AT LEAST THE FIGHTS WERE DYNAMIC AND ENGAGING. Planes twisting and turning in epic 45 second fights to see who could get the advantage. Nicking each other with bullets but never getting a killing blow because they couldn't get an upper hand. With patch 1.29 it has simply become ""hey you got the first nick on the enemy plain, congratz you won the dogfight"".
 
&gt;Among other things, this further upsets the balance of boom and zoom playstyle of the already over powered russian planes etc. japanese are seriously underpowered now as they can not stay alive long enough to engage in an ACTUAL TURN FIGHT.
 
&gt;OVERALL, I think I can understand the direction they were trying for, but high damage simply DOES NOT WORK with such easy accuracy in arcade battles. This change has taken away the FUN of arcade mode and while damage models can be tuned it needs to be done with EXTREME care as it greatly changes how the game is played. Think of the difference between Halo and COD. Both great games but both vastly different simply because of the different damage model used in both games.
 
&gt;As for the economy changes, I will have to play more before I can make a statement, but as for the damage model change, this change can EASILY be felt within the first five minutes of playing arcade mode and is why I feel comfortable making such a post as this.""

TL;DR: Patch 1.29 needs a bit of work.

Edit: A lot of people are getting discouraged reading so much flak about the game (pun intended I guess). Remember, the most important thing to do is to go play the game yourself and form your own opinions about the patch. I have played for a while now and these views stated here simply reflect my opinion about the patch."	t5_2uc6j	True

On the surface it has bells and whistles that might appeal to many, but the faults are quickly becoming more prominent, and to my mind there is a regression.



    Say you are a eager player, you have a few nations around tier 17-18 
and you have sunk some cash and time into the game:

You have 150 planes in your hangar, and all of them are now nerfed ~~20%~~ 10% in the new patch.

This is no problem, as you can buy newly added upgrades to your planes, a la WoT - to get them back to 100% performance in terms of flightmodel.

The cost per plane is hard to estimate, but an average of somewhere 
in the region of 150 - 200.000 per plane seems reasonable.

Edit: At least if you look in the tier 9-20 range.



~~150 x 200.000 equals 30 million silver lions - to have the same performance in 1.33 as you have in the current patch for all of the planes you have already bought and ground.~~

Edit: Ok - the math was slightly for effect - Lets say 55 Planes you play times an average of 200.000
A ""mere"" 11 millions. Lets get back to this - Any which way  - Its going to be damn expensive.




    Now enter the lock out time for players leaving a game.
(Jury is still out on this one, might not be as bad as i initially thought)

You can frequently be matched with Jet planes playing a prop plane, or planes 10 tiers higher than you.


They keep adding planes the matchmaker cannot handle, and instead of adapting the MM to the player count the assumption is that if we only get more players the MM will be fine.

The matchmaker is sometimes so bad, people leave the games because the cost of repairing planes are so high they just can't afford to be sealclubbed by Jets.

~~Enter the grand development scheme to combat this: 
Lock out the player  of the game for the duration of the game or 5 minutes if he leaves.~~


    This fall nicely in line with other ways to punish players for playing the game:

...the repair times for planes you will not pay to repair is touching a week.

...the cost of repair so high for high tier planes, you are hard pressed to make a profit killing several opponents, should you yourself be killed.



    Add to the mix, the insane grind you now have to do to get access to any non default ammo belt.
    The cost of high tier ammo will also become an issue in 1.33 I suspect.


Believe me, I am conscious of the fact that a F2P game needs to make money 
- And I have spent around 100 USD on the game to date.
I have more than 50 days of premium left on my account.

I will not spend another dime. I will not renew my premium in this environment.
    
    


    These developments are driving me away from a game I love, 
    which had the makings of being a WoWP killer, even a WoT killer.










They are continuously developing game mechanics that are punishing the players for playing the game.

And in any F2P online multiplayer, the player IS the content - without them there is no game.

There are huge logical flaws in game, bugs, errors on win/game mechanics, meaningless objectives and useless game objects they could improve upon.

~~Instead the focus is on copying WoT, leaving all pretence of ""historical accuracy"" behind.~~
Not totally sold on the strikethrough but... ok..

The constant rebalancing of OP planes, available for real money is another earmark of F2P games many of us have left behind.

~~There are premium planes that gets lower tiering than their stock counterparts.~~

This has the scent of ""Pay to Win"" and ~~I suspect premium ammo is not far away.~~

Its such a shame that this beautiful game, with so much promise, seems to be managed down the drain.

So, we have seen situations with medium repair costs and low rewards (1.29), and high repair costs with low purchase costs(1.31). Overall though Gaigin (IMO) should try a situation with low repair costs and high purchase price. This offers several advantages.

1. People need to keep playing the game. If people are not playing the game, they are not spending money on the game. If the players have to wait for repairs or can't fly their planes then they are not playing the game. For a game currently as small as this one they need to keep as much of the playerbase as possible.

2. Low repair costs make the game more fun. Even if you have to play a hundred matches to save up the money for your next plane they will be more fun than 15 matches where you are constantly worrying about how you will pay your repair bill.

3. Low repair costs promote team play. When your repair costs won't kill your profits from this battle and the last one you are more willing to stick your neck out to help a team-mate or complete an objective.

4. Long times between levels are far more bearable than not being able to play at all.

**(This is kind of TL;DRish for the first section)**

See what I mean? Better gameplay, plenty of opportunity for people to want to spend money to level. Comparatively, if people have to wait and aren't able to play the game they won't pay money at all. You have to have somebody extremely dedicated to the game to repeatedly pay real money just for the opportunity to play.

---

**How The Economy Should Work**

We have a couple things to consider when considering how we want the economy to work.

1. We want to keep people in the game.

2. We want to make gameplay fun.

3. We want to make it accessible to all skill levels.

4. We want people to spend money.

So, how do we do this? To start off we nuke repair costs. Not gone, but not too much of a concern. We want everybody to be able to make money every round. This helps with all of the first three points.

But, if we have such low repair cost how will we balance planes? After all, we want them to have historical performance so we balance them with repair costs, right? No, under this system planes are balanced by their reward bonus. Doesn't punish rounds where you get insta-gibbed by AAA or whatnot, but still makes some planes less desirable.

Third, we turn up purchase costs. Probably to 1.29 first variation. Not something we want to hear as players, I know. But, if you are making money every round you can at least know you won't be going backwards. This is where the advancement money comes in. Even if it takes a long time to level up you can be on playing. This will help with point 1 and 4.

Add cosmetic options to purchase. Historical and fun skins, custom decals, pilot logos etc. Brings in some money without being P2W.

Add ""Premium-a-Plane"" as a GE option. Ups the reward bonus and gives an experience bonus on any plane you buy it for. (This is just a good idea, not integral.)

This economy would receive some flak at first for being ""1.29 all over again"", but with people able to fly the planes they love they would soon be glad for it. People would naturally fly all tiers too, just because you could have fun.

**TL;DR** The new economy will be shit for player retention, and this is how it should work. It will take you less time to read this than it took me to type this.

**ANY MORE SUGGESTIONS WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED. IF I FUCKED UP SOME PART OF MY LOGIC PLEASE TELL ME. I WILL BE POSTING THIS ON THE FORUMS TOO.**

In the current patch (1.31), when you get into a new aircraft you're stuck using the shitty ammo belts for maybe 5-6 games until you unlock the omni purpose ammo belt.  Depending on the tier, that's like 30-50k XP and you can grind that out in 5-6 games.  On the other hand, depending on the nation you're playing and the guns you're stuck with, it can be god fucking awful.

Well, in the new patch Gaijin has completely removed ""ammo belts"" in the traditional sense.  **Now you have to unlock the Tier IV Offensive Armament to even get the ammo belts**.  In my Typhoon Mk 1b/Late that equates to **490,000XP** of using the god awful default ammo belt.

What the fuck are you thinking Gaijin...

&gt;You have an opportunity to buy modifications with golden eagles.

Oh nevermind, I see exactly where this is headed.  Well, this game was nice while it lasted and not a grindy pile of shit like World of Tanks.

1372032763.0	1gxr0o	"PSA for Fighter Pilots: ""Lawn Mowing"" AKA not bothering to climb at the start of a round is always a bad idea."	NOACeulemans	102	21	78	"You read it. In HB's it is **always** a stupid idea to not climb in a fighter. There's a reason people derogatorily call it 'lawn mowing'.

___

Why? Twofold explanation:

1. **You screw over your teammates by not climbing at the start.** Every fighter gone lawnmowing is a fighter missing on your side during the decisive high-altitude combat that takes place first in every round. If there are more enemies at high altitude than there are friendlies, the odds are stacked in their favor. Once the high-alt dogfights are over, the winners move on to clearing out the fighters at low altitude. Look at War Thunder dogfights as a 'king of the hill'-type metagame. The winner of the highest-altitude fights has enough energy to then take on planes at lower altitudes and zoom right out with a speed advantage. The more players at high-alt, the better the odds of winning 'the hill'.

2. **You will not make more by getting ground kills instead of air kills.** Statistically speaking, you affect your team's odds of winning more by throwing your weight against enemy fighters at high altitude than popping a dozen AA emplacements and artillery units. Winning pays off *far* more than killing ground units, especially for fighters (the cash/xp multiplier is very low for air-to-ground kills in fighters).

___

Common excuses that are not valid:

- *It's always worked for me so far!* Except when it hasn't, and from the average player's win ratio, that's about 50% of the time. Fly a bomber or dedicated ground attack plane if you're so giddy for ground kills. Or try to contribute to your team's win and your own win rate by throwing your weight in where it matters.

- *They'll ignore me anyway while you guys do the high-alt dogfights!* Oh yeah that's admirable, let your team pull all the weight while you go parasitically suck out a few ground kills. I hope you get slammed by AA on the way out. If your team fails at high altitudes, the entire enemy team will come bearing down on you at high speeds.

- *I'll just kill a few ground targets and then when they come for me I'll kill one or two by outturning them*. Energy advantage is the number one best asset for a fighter. A good energy fighter will wipe the floor with a good turnfighter because the skill cap is much higher and the tactics make much more sense: the energy fighter can strike at you from any angle and escape in any direction. You, the lawnmower, can't go up indefinitely and so you're doomed if he attacks from directly above (rope-a-dopes will have you stalled out and vulnerable).

___

**TL;DR:** Don't be a lawnmowing idiot, instead contribute to your team by putting your plane where it's needed: at higher and higher altitudes. Climb until you spot them and climb higher than your enemies.

___

I think it would be awesome to give a few minutes after the match is decided to allow players that are **already in the process** of returning to base for repairs or reloads to land.  It doesn't have to be a LONG time, just enough time to allow players that are already halfway home with their busted planes to attempt their landing and get their repair done.  You could lock weapons and disable collisions so that people don't continue to play and kill each other after the match ends.

In HB, it is a very positive experience for me to bring a damaged plane back home safely.  It gives me a feeling of accomplishment that is more satisfying than shooting down an enemy.  Plus, free repairs are AWESOME.  Few things frustrate me more in HB than getting kicked out of a match while I am trying to land my damaged plane.  3 minutes should do the trick, give or take depending on the map.

What do you guys think?

I'm making this post to address an issue that's been quite a handful as of late - how to handle those who break the rules on this subreddit. We could just as easily leave this a quiet matter in the background, but we, as the mod-team, feel it's fair to let you know what's being done with the subreddit you're subscribed to and contribute to.

Anyhow, we have a few tools at our disposal to deal with this kind of problem.

Two specific bans have been made: /u/Protohuman (along with his alts) and /u/ORYG1NAL_GAMER (along with his alts).

- The former, who you know as the founder of RDDT3, was banned site-wide by reddit admins (who intervened promptly after we contacted them) over vote manipulation and using sockpuppet accounts.

- The latter was also banned over the same reasons [despite being warned previously](http://i.imgur.com/z93qzIH.png). To make it clear: [this is not appropriate behavior](http://i.imgur.com/ansNP74.png) because reddit's very rules (bottom of every reddit page, guys) forbid it. We have not notified the reddit admins over /u/ORYG1NAL_GAMER's rules breach, and do not plan to do so as it is no longer a problem to us.

We don't particularly enjoy this kind of thing. I'm a pretty time-intensive reddit user, so I know how harsh a ban would be to someone who uses reddit a lot. These are not handed out willy-nilly, rest assured.

Anyhow, we thank you for bringing previous offenses to our attention. It helps us all improve the subreddit.

&gt; [...]So basicly i will bring some more light into the debate, i build the 109 line and i changed most things on my own review, but i allways check some new sources, and if those are valid i also integreate some new aspects of the FMs. Basicly due the core code changes, some 109 specs were moved, so i had to correct those again, the SL speed of the 109F4 was too high, its corrected, and the G2 was way to sluggish on high G manouvers etc.
Just to give alsao an impression how difficult it is to judge the right numbers, the tachometer of the 109 had an error of +- 5%!! That means with a SL speed reported of 527 kmh back in 42, it could be 553 km/h or also 500 km/h, additional the Weatherconditions etc. So you get a lot of different numbers, so basicly i didn't went to extremes! We don't model the lowest neitehr the highest numbers, we modell the ones in which are backed up by a number of valid historical docs! And if we find an bug or something else, we gonna correct it!
 
&gt;What we're NOT doing, we don't nerf or buff things, these balance bla bla language is not used by us FM devs. We go for the historical numbers! From time to time these numbers are a bit shifted, but that happen due some additional parameters of the core code engine. In such case we go back to those modells an correct the specs again. So no nerf and buff on FMs! It never happend here in the past, and it never will happen in the future! So please do me a farvour and stop using this WoW Language! My eras starts to bleed allready about it......



This should give us confidence that Gaijin -in contrast to other developers- is solely aiming for historical accuracy in regards of FMs and won't implement arcadish ""buffs"" and ""nerfs"" (God, I started to hate those terms) in order to achieve a certain balance. But since this is a complex task it obviously requires a lot of time.

It's just a reminder to remain patient even if some FMs seem to be broken. I've seen a lot of ""OP this"" and ""OP that"" comments lately, which doesn't seem right in a game that aims for historical accuracy. Eventually we're going to have fleshed out FMs all across the board and then the only important factor in the game will be the personal skill of every pilot."	t5_2uc6j	True

1363559411.0	1ahlg6	Subreddit Announcement: Please Read.	NOACeulemans	84	9	36	"Hello /r/warthunder,

it's been pointed out to me that over the last week by a few unhappy users, while myself and Commander_Adama were often absent (both of us were not near a computer much of last week), a few negative things started re-occurring more and more frequently around here.

- First, the presence of tags in people's submissions is somewhat lacking. I know this seems trivial, but the usage of tags makes life easier on everyone: it helps people filter content, and it streamlines discussion. This rule has been around for a few weeks now and is hard to miss in the [submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/submit).

- Second, please keep self-promotion to a minimum. Yes, we all like streamers and youtube videos, but we don't want the subreddit to become a link-dump for all budding Let's Play-ers and streamers. For now, this is just a request; you can submit your own videos, but please make them at least worth the watch. If it's just you playing regular rounds, don't spam it too often. If this issue gets out of hand, we'll take more serious action.

- Third, please consider if what you're submitting is really worth submitting. Do we really need a picture of your botched landing? It most likely won't be upvoted much, it's a pretty common post, after all. Again, for now, I'm just asking you to consider it. If this also gets out of hand, we'll start completely removing un-interesting screenshots and the like.

**Posts that are clearly specific to a certain game-mode that are untagged will from now on be removed, and the OP will be told to re-submit with the appropriate tag.**

Screenshots that are not entirely specific to a game mode will be allowed, but it would be best if you still tagged them. Videos that are recorded in a certain game mode, i.e. ""watch me go 15-0 in a [plane name]"", that are untagged, will be removed.

If you have any qualms about this, please do comment below. We're always looking for feedback on how to make this a better subreddit."	t5_2uc6j	True

Another thing, if its a beta, treat it like a beta. When you are taking real money from players, it's not a beta and if you make what the players bought essentially worthless, there are even more issues.


Concerning star conflict, it's pretty obvious why the loyalty gain was severy nerfed. You want players to spend $20+ to be competitive with someone that played for a few months or weeks longer. You can't just nerf something like this in a ""final"" version and not do a wipe. The new players are supposed to grind for half a year to reach a level that the older players got to in a week? 


I like most players, play games for fun. None of these economy/loyalty changes are fun, so the most logical thing to do is move on to games That are fun and where $20 can buy more than one plane or a few modules that would otherwise take months to earn while older players earned them in a couple of days."	t5_2uc6j	True

I've done a lot for this community in my eyes. Sponsoring events, spreading the word, spending my Own REAL money. And I get shit on. 

Why? Those of you who keep down voting me, please... Tell me why. If you just hate me, that's fine. I just want to know the honest truth. Whatever it may be.

1368555185.0	1ebub3	[HB/FRB] Axioms for Air Combat Maneuvering	bside	81	8	22	"I saw these tips included as part of the larger FRB beginners guide posted on warthunder forums (edit: originally posted here: http://www.jg51.net/fletchman.htm) but I think they deserve more attention and would be very useful to HB players as well, since I see a lot of these mistakes on a regular basis. It serves as a nice supplement to the Dicta Boelcke dogfighting fundamentals I think most are familiar with:

**Don’t Climb into a Fight!**

If you find yourself climbing into a fight you are almost always in the process of making a mistake. The enemy is almost sure to have the advantage in energy-state, and therefore have the initiative. It is generally very unwise to “force” an engagement from an inferior energy state.

**Attack from a position of advantage!**

Air Combat is War! Arena Combat is not the place for genteel dueling or gentlemanly “level playing field” flying. There are plenty of “Dueling Ladders” available for those so inclined. The Arena is not the place for that kind of flying philosophy. Its about using all the advantages that God gave you to shoot down other planes without being shot down yourself. Plan your attacks carefully. Move into a favorable attack position first – don’t just “jump into” that fur ball! Take advantage of “blind spots” and distraction opposition to score quick kills. Never give the opposition “an even break”, because he certainly wouldn’t cut you any slack if the position was reversed!


**Attack with surprise on your side!**

There is no law against cunning. Look for setting up a surprise attack on a target whenever possible. Look for situations where the target may have poor SA; move into blind spots and sneak up on the target!


**With a superior energy state go high
With an inferior energy state go low**

If you have the better energy state you have the advantage. Stay above your opponent if at all possible. After completing a gun pass its usually a big mistake to “go low” to reengage. Going high conserves energy. Going “low” is good when on the defensive. You are in trouble, the most important factor is to keep your airspeed up. If you are in an inferior energy state and by attempting to “go high” you will be cutting your airspeed – you’re a sitting duck! Keeping up your airspeed allows you to maneuver more crisply. And who knows – your opponent could make a mistake, which you could exploit with a bit of maneuverability.

**When it Doubt – Go Vertical!**

In air combat, especially in WWII planes, its almost always a good idea to use the vertical as much as possible. If you have the Energy level to “go high”, its rarely a mistake to do so. Don’t stick to “flat” turns in a dogfight! That will lead to very high insurance premiums.

**Eternal Vigilance or Eternal Rest!**

The Most important factor in Air Combat is to see the opponent! Spot him first (and his friends!), keep him in sight at all times. Whatever system you use for views, (castle switches, keyboard etc) learn it backwards and forwards before you do anything else! Scan your views at least once every 15 seconds even in a “quiet” sky. Otherwise the first indication of danger could be bullets ripping through your plane.

Learn how to count!
Don’t attack outnumbered unless you have the energy advantage. The worse you are outnumbered the bigger the advantage should be. If you are badly outnumbered you only have to miscalculate the energy state of one of the enemy gaggle to end up going home via parachute.

**Calculate firing lead before opening fire!**

Don’t fire first and ask questions later! Try to gauge the “Kentucky Windage” before you pull the trigger. Otherwise you might find yourself flying around without ammunition real fast.

**Short Range! Short Bursts!**

When shooting, leave the Water hose in the Garden. If you missed the target, be a man and admit it! Don’t try to “walk” the tracers into the target plane, because ammo doesn’t grow on trees! Short bursts initially, then if you really have the range down, fire for effect! Generally shots over 300 yards are waste of time against a hard maneuvering plane. Get in close and hit hard! If the target is flying straight and level, shots to twice your convergence range are allowed. Outside of that you are most likely wasting ammo unless you are flying a plane like the P38 which has no gun convergence. Remember that Cannon will “drop” faster than machine guns at very long range.

**Get “Out of Plane” when being fired on!**

No that doesn’t mean bail out! When evading fire think aileron and rudder – not just elevator! The infamous “flat break turn” is the easiest defensive move to track with guns. That is an “in plane” maneuver, the easiest maneuver to maintain a gun solution on! Make the guy work for it. Use Jinking rudder moves and aileron rolls to evade fire. If you can force the guy to pull negative G’s to fire, so much the better. He will be seeing “red” real soon.

**Avoid “Dead Six”!**

Its generally wiser to attack slightly from the side than to attack from a dead-on Six O’clock position. The targets presents a very small cross section from “Dead Six”, which makes for a difficult shot except at point-blank range. At ranges over 150 yards, try to attack slightly from the side. This present a much larger cross section and involves a minimal gun deflection angle. It also helps avoid collisions!

**Think Energy – Not Stick**

There is an old saying “Colonels think tactics – Generals think Logistics”. Well Fighter Pilots a similar adage. “Average Pilots think Stick – Good Pilots think Energy!” Even when in a tight fur ball always keep relative energy states in mind. This will allow you to evaluate what he can do, and what you can do with more accuracy. Always try to keep that last ounce of Energy in your back pocket as your “Ace in the Hole”. You may need to play that card sooner than you think!

**Turn into the attacker – not away!**

Well this one goes back to Boelke! By turning “into” the attack you are maneuvering so as to avoid allowing the guy to get on your “six”. By turning “away” from the attack you are making it easy for the attacker to gain angle.

**Lead turns – Its not just for the vertical anymore!**

Many pilots know that in the eternal battle for “angle”, the “lead turn” is a useful tool. But they forget that lead turning is also permitted in the horizontal, not just the vertical. That is: lateral separation can be exploited just as easily with a lead turn as vertical separation.

**Remember the “Rule of 45″!**

When making a energy based rear quarter attack with a fair amount of closure on target, follow the target for about 45 degrees of “break”. If you haven’t killed him by then its time to Zoom and do another pass! Following that break turn too much will surrender your Energy advantage, and could lead to disastrous overshoots. Its generally a poor idea to follow an “out of plane” break down if you have a fair amount of closure on target. If the target breaks with a Split-S or similar maneuver (such as a slice-back) its usually a bad idea to follow, since your high speed will actually work against you as the target breaks low. Instead establish a lag pursuit situation or go vertical to establish a dominant altitude advantage with vertical separation. Then close in for another pass. Remember it is often takes several energy passes to “wear down” the targets energy state to the point where the kill is assured!

**Lag Pursuit with superior Energy.
Lead Pursuit with equal or inferior Energy.**

When attempting to gain gun angle on a target use geometry to close on target who has equal or higher energy by “cutting the corner” of his turn. That is, anticipate his flight path and and “lead” it. Lag Pursuit avoids problems with gun deflection and closure. Instead of flying straight at the target and taking a high deflection shot at his turning plane with a large amount of closure, simply “lag” out side his turn. That is, often you deliberately turn outside his circle, going high. This conserves energy advantage and sets up a more promising shot when you re-engage.

**Always Fly Aggressively!**

When in the Air, always think aggressively – even when you are on the defensive. One of the skills of all successful pilots is a basic killer instinct. Flying in a tentative or indecisive fashion will just get you killed. A good pilot will use your hesitation against you. While foolhardy recklessness is pointless, the good pilot is the master of the calculated risk. Building the judgment to know when a risk is justified is a key to success.

**Know your Plane**

Understand the strengths of your plane, and also the planes you are flying against. Their strengths and weaknesses should be etched in your mind. A good pilot knows how to exploit the strong points of his ride, and exploit the weak points of the target plane to get the victory. Don’t fly “against” your plane by asking it to something its not capable of. You will die."	t5_2uc6j	True

1372216686.0	1h31td	So, did Gaijin just pull a huge bait-and-switch on us?	Sibilantjoe	80	11	143	"Let's all think back to a couple of days ago, when [this article](http://warthunder.com/en/news/181/current/) appeared on WT's website about the planned economy changes. The first two data points, namely plane purchase cost and repair costs have appeared in today's patch as advertised. Well and good. 

Then let's look at [this little doozy](http://warthunder.com/upload/image/490x275/income_eng.png). It's a fairly straightforward graph--rewards in 1.31 will be the same as 1.29, except for the bonus of ""battle trophies – random rewards, whose drop-out chances are based on the amount of time played, aircraft destroyed, etc."" I'm not here to talk about how it's a crap idea to expect us to cover increased repair costs with just random bonuses. I'm here to talk about how we didn't even get that.

Basically, Gaijin has DECREASED the reward bonus on planes across every nation and tier, from small changes like nerfing the Airacobra's reward from 60 to 50 percent, to big ones--the Ju-87G2 was nerfed from 150 to 90 percent reward, to just name a couple of affected planes that were by no means overperforming. 

Going into this patch, Gaijin promised us that the increased repair costs would be offset by greater rewards (not just random trophies). Their own words say it best:

&gt;Besides these improvements there will be more traditional benefits such as what we introduced in version 1.27: the better you play, the more you get. Of course, if you do not play well, you may lose to a greater extent.

Well, they're right about the 'losing' part. I'd like to say I'm surprised that they (at best) misled us about this, but at this point I just feel disappointment."	t5_2uc6j	True

Each map however is _not_ about taking out the other planes. The objectives are quire clear. Capture an airfeild, destroy ground-targets, bomb a bridge.

Why, you can take out ALL the ground targets fairly quick and the match will be over, you both get to eat your sack lunches on the trip home.

Since Warthunder is all about these objectives, and it just so _happens_ that there are ""bad"" planes around when you _do_ these things; why is there so little incentive to accomplish these main goals?

I can spend the whole map killing ground targets, I can be **THE** reason we win, and yet have a VERY low score and XP-reward.

I can even have the most captures, again, leading my air-force to victory, but the game doesn't seem to congratulate, reward, or incentivize this (not like it does for an ""air kill"").

I _get_ how fun it is to take down the other air-force. A successful air-kill is nearly its own reward in that regard. But as I find that even domination-maps are driven by ground-kills now, I feel the game should reward and incentivize this behaviour."	t5_2uc6j	True

Dorniers are good against bombers and sometimes you want to bomb yourself. Common things we all can agree.

Yet, you have to pick your plane before you head out into the battle. Thus, just picking a fighter is always the option you are going to take. It fits everything, at least almost. Not all of them can land on the carriers, you see.


We should be able to pick a ""deck of planes"", for example three planes maximum for Historic Battle. Your matchmaking level is decided by the highest tiered plane and that way you have incentive to pick your deck pretty solidly around one tier.

You could have a bomber, a carrier aircraft and some vastly superior land based fighter. This way, no matter what match comes for you as an American, you can always pick the one you want.

Or hey, maybe as a German you get Bulge and you want to use the Do217 to shoot them down? But that Do won't do you a lot of good in Sicily, so pick your BF when the time is for that.

1363860474.0	1aq3ng	The Reason it is Easier to Die yet Harder to Kill in 1.29.	keep_digging_watson	75	12	81	"So after playing the game for roughly thirty hours since the patch (ya I play a lot) I have finally come to the conclusion as to why it seems it is much easier to die yet harder to get kills in 1.29.

*To start off let me explain what the new damage model did to the game. The new DM placed more ""critical points"" on a plane's model. This means you can wound an enemy in a lot more places than in 1.27. In 1.27, there was only a few VERY critical points on a plane's model. This, for the most part, included the tail, wings, engine, and propeller. Concentrated fire to any of these parts would result in an almost INSTANTANEOUS KILL meaning big white letters appear across the screen that say KILL CONFIRMED or whatever they say. This was satisfactory and felt rewarding knowing you had targeted the right spot and were able to concentrate your fire to that area. Most kills ended with an engine exploding, tail coming off, or a wing flying off.

*Now, in 1.29, these ""super"" critical points have been removed (at least it seems like it) meaning it is much harder to get the guaranteed,immediate kill. What it has been replaced with is far more sensitive damage zones on the plane's model that all have far less impact as a whole. Now you can damage flaps, elevators, engines, fuselages, propellers, crewman, put holes in the wings, etc. All of which are very easy to hit and damage but none guarantee you an instant kill (except perhaps a direct hit to the pilot). 
What does this mean? Getting a kill is a much longer and more painstakingly drawn out experience for both the attacker and the victim. You might damage an enemies elevator on your first few well placed shots (guaranteeing an EVENTUAL death of that plane) BUT IF YOU WANT CREDIT FOR THAT KILL YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO STAY ON THAT PLANE AND KEEP FIRING AND FIRING AND WOUNDING AND WOUNDING UNTIL THAT PLANE CRASHES INTO THE GROUND, no matter how long that might take. And if you don't do this there are a thousand factors that can end up taking that kill away from you. The other side of that is you are flying along and get shot in the tail/propeller/engine. You didn't die immediately, but now you are doomed to watch your plane glide down to earth and either crash or soft land if possible. Also, good luck trying to throw someone off your tail after you ""got a hole in your left wing"" from the first shot fired by the enemy.

**In summary**: 1.29 has decreased the chance of immediate death but GREATLY increased the chance of getting ""wounded"" in different parts of the plane which greatly decreases performance and leads to a LONG AND DRAWN OUT DEATH. Getting credit for kills has been made much harder due to the increased sort of ""window"" in which a plane is dying, allowing other planes to take kills, etc.


**Edit**: A number of people have commented on how to improve on this system without changing the gameplay. Here are some of the points made that I think will really improve the system as is.

*1. Make an ""Assists"" column next to the ""kills"" column. While this is simply aesthetic, it does provide some sense of accomplishment knowing everyone can see how many assists you have worked for.

*2. Boost the amount of points given to people who get assists or to people who get critical shots on an enemy plane.

*3. Allow more than one person to get an assist on kill. For instance, two people can now get an assist point for helping down an enemy plane.

I think these changes would greatly improve this game for the better, making it more ""team"" oriented and less ""kill steal-y""."	t5_2uc6j	True

Obviously this data is subject to change as this isn't the final version of the patch. I only tested the planes that the 1.29 changelog listed as being new. Some planes I unfortunately couldn't test because I didn't have them unlocked or I just didn't have the time. Those planes are: La-7, Wirraway, Ki-49, Me.262, Me.163 and the B &amp; G versions of the stuka.


**The FM tests:**

Conditions: Using the lowest amount of fuel selectable and carrying no bombs/rockets and uninstalling engine, fuselage and pylon upgrades. If bombs were forced on dropped before performing tests.

These conditions are mirrored between 1.29 and 1.27.

    	New turn time @ 2000ft = 14.1 seconds

Slightly disappointed that my favorite, the ME410 had its speed reduced however it may have had its acceleration increased, either that or it was my imagination. Also it seemed to be a tad more resilient to enemy fire than it used to be which was sorely needed! Also I quickly tested the 109F4 and the wings no longer get shot off as easily as in 1.27. I presume this echos to the other 109's that had that problem.

1369484887.0	1f0ysu	Unofficial transcript of Dev Q&amp;A from this Friday - 25/05/13	darkflare42	60	4	44	"Hey guys, I attended the Dev Q&amp;A which was held yesterday (Friday the 24th)with Trojan, Borisych, Senio, Scarper BVV_d (Gaijin's ammo specialist) and Alex Polyakov (War Thunder Senior Programmer) who joined later on in the session.

During the Q&amp;A I transcribed the questions and answers, mainly for myself for later reading but I'm posting this here too so everyone can have a look, since it does take Gaijin some time to transcribe and post it on their forums, since they don't work on weekends.

Important to note that this is an **Unofficial** transcript - I left out certain questions which did not add to the discussion (Like questions on future development), but I did try and transcribe the devs answers as accurately to their word as possible.

Here it is:

* **Q: Why can I set certain parts of a plane multiple times on fire, like the wing for instance?** 
 * **A:** This is the current situation, there will be changes in how ammo will work as it is still being worked on.

* **Q: Why is mouse aim and instructor more resistant to damage than other control**
 * **A:** This is not true, the DM is similar for both. There is no change in the DM between mouse-aim and joystick. The instructor helps you or your enemy to compensate for his mistakes, that's why it seems that with instructor you can withstand more damage.

* **Q: Is there a reason why certain planes with 12.7mm planes have more punch than other planes with .50 cals (they kill them faster)** 
 * **A:**  I think this is because of the different tolerance levels of damage for each plane you are attacking, or it could be related to the different parts of the plane you are hitting.

* **Q: There is a glitch in spotting in FRB, on some distances it is rendered well, on others it is rendered as a black dot and sometimes it disappears**
 * **A:** Hang on, it will be sorted out. We can't elaborate further than that but it is coming.

* **Q: It seems that Hispano cannons are not performing as well as the Japanese cannons or Germans MG, is it a bug or is it supposed to be like this?**
 * **A:** First you have to wait for the upcoming update, most weapons, including Hispanos were changed or improved as well as the other cannons from other nations. Hispanos will be a bit more precise, they will have a better explosive effect and thus it will be more efficient than it currently is. For Germans the MG cannon will have better fragmentation or splash effect from the HEI Minengeschoß rounds. So basically hang on tight an wait for the upcoming global patch - there are more surprises in it.

* **Q: It looks like there is an historical inaccuracy in the Ki-61 models - The Ki-61 1c should have HO-5 20mm japanese cannon and not the German MG151. The 1a 388 model should have the german MG151**
 * **A:** It could be that this is fixed in the next global update because they did a lot of work on the planes and guns which are currently in the game. We will however check it again, if we are wrong and what is in the game is historically incorrect - we will fix it ASAP.

* **Q: Is there any plans to change the look and feel of how the cannons and the projectiles are fired - like giving them a shotgun effect with more recoil?**
 * **A:** As we said earlier, the Hispanos and other guns will feel different inthe next update. The recoil is calculated by the physics, FM and the location of the cannon in the plane. As all Hispano cannons are mounted in the wings the recoil effect is always higher and feels heavier than engine cannons like Germans for example. The Hispano cannon shells are very heavy and their velocity is also very high. The combination of those have an effect on their recoil pattern. Either way we feel that the recoil, gun drop and the way the bullets behave is historically accurate.

* **Q: Will we be able to mount different ammo belts to specific machine guns in a certain plane? For example, in US planes when we have 6 MGs we have just one ammo belt for all 6**
 * **A:** Yeah we know about this issue, unfortunately it won't be in the upcoming update, but we are planning to implement it.

* **Q: Is the Type-99 mk2 performing correctly in HB at the moment or is it over-performing\under-performing?**
 * **A:** Regarding the current version of the game - In 1.29 they are not correctly implemented in comparison to other cannons, but in the upcoming global update there are many changes to guns and ammo belts. They will perform similar to Hispanos because the weight of the shells and their velocity is similar. There is currently a difference however between the HE ammo belt and the AP in terms of performance (one is currently better than the other), but they are not over-performing by any means.

* **Q: Some of the load-outs of UK and US are not on par, like the mosquito which has an incorrect bomb load, are there going to be different bomb types as well?**
 * **A:**  The most popular types of bomb loads during WW2 will surely be implemented, more will come and be introduced as time goes on. Also more bombs will be implemented, unfortunately we cannot say if its coming in the upcoming update but either way the correct bomb loads will be implemented and different bombs will come.

* **Q: When you have a damaged wing, it doesn't behave like it should. if you pitch up it rolls left and if you pitch down it rolls right, it acts like an anchor weighing you down instead of giving a-symmetrical lift**
 * **A:** The problem you are talking about will cause a change in plane behaviour for sure - We will look into it ASAP and fix it if this really is a problem\bug

* **Q: With the addition of the extra DM that you can take since last patch, are there any plans to make a ""decal"" system to reflect the correct damage inflicted to your plane (one bullet shot at you -  one bullet seen on the plane where you got shot)?**
 * **A:**  This ""issue"" is connected to the graphical load of GFX cards. We do want and we wish to make it, so that what you see on the plane represents the correct damage you inflicted or received, whether it is the amount of bullets or the type of damage from the different ammo types for instance. However, this is very hard work and it takes a lot of parameters to implement it correctly. We have to make compromises because some GFX cannot handle that much graphical fidelity. You will however see an increase in graphical variety of the damage inflicted Soon™

* **Q: Will we see a bomb bigger than 4k lb?** 
 * **A:** Most definitely yes. Heavier bombs will be introduced at some point

* **Q: When using .50 cals it seems to take 600 rounds to take out plane, are they currently under-performing?**
 * **A:** The .50 cals weren't super effective historically, you need a lot of guns for them to be effective. We think that in the game they are performing pretty close to historical accuracy.

* **Q: Do all the rounds in this game have the correct ballistic co-efficiency and is there a damage curve which reduces their effectiveness in regards to range?**
 * **A:** Yes it is  calculated but it will be more accurate in the upcoming update. The higher the caliber the more the loss of energy, cannons are less efficient in longer ranges than .50 cals for instance, since the projectiles have different characteristics like air resistance, weight etc. It will be changed in the upcoming update and it will be much more detailed. 

* **Q: How do you get the stats on the bullets and the damage that they inflict, do you use statistics? What methods do you use?**
 * **A:** The ballistics are calculated from real documentation, we try to make it as real as possible since obviously we cant take out planes and start shooting at each other IRL

* **Q: Do you plan on adding more shell racks and variety?**
 * **A:** Most definitely yes. As an example you will have a new belt for the Stuka G1 &amp; G2 (37mm cannons) with only HEF shells which will be more effective for hunting bombers. There will be more ammo belts for other planes as well this was just an example.

* **Q: Hit detection, sometimes i see damage decal without getting damage message, does this mean that the damage is detected and applied? There is a hit but no XP and Lion reward**
 * **A:** when you see the damage decal, it means that the plane has experienced some damage, We know about this issue where you do inflict damage but it is not critical and you do not get a ""hit"" message - sometimes we do not count damage taken or inflicted by you if its not critical, it is something that we will have to work on, but improvements are coming. 

* **Q: Mouse aim users can pull off maneuvers which Joystick users cannot even try to attempt, this is unfair and hurts the joystick community, are there any plans to change or fix this situation?** 
 * **A:** We want to implement different filters for you to use when you queue up for a match like ""no mouse players"" for example, but currently there aren't not enough online players to justify it. Regarding mouse aim - yes it is a very easy mode like point and shoot. Each control method has its advantages and disadvantages, a good Joystick player can be as capable if not more capable than a mouse aim player. But yes we are working to give more hardcore players satisfaction in the gameplay. The game will evolve as more users will join, we do want more and more people playing on realistic settings rather than arcade and mouse-aim.

* **Q: Economics, do you plan on making further changes to economy?**
 * **A:** We will have a special economy update deployed, before or after the global update. It will be balanced between 1.27 and the current 1.29 economy. Majority of people will benefit from this update. So a dedicated economy update will come soon!

Pixelated_Toast	73	11	39	"When I say most important damage, I mean if someone shoots down an enemy's engine and another teammate shot down the rudder, the person who shot out the engine should get the kill.

1375261290.0	1jesxm	Tony Gaze, a relatively unknown Australian fighter ace, died yesterday at the age of 93.	hamsta5	69	10	8	"One of Australia's most famous fighter pilots, Tony Gaze died yesterday aged 93.

Tony was at university in England when the war broke out and enlisted in the RAF. He became a fighter pilot flying mostly Spitfires with many squadrons including 453 (RAAF) Squadron in Europe.

Credited with 12 1/2 official victories and four probables Tony commented the real total was more than 20 due to the stringent claiming requirements.

He was himself shot down over occupied territory in 1943 and with facial and head wounds was fortunately rescued by the French Resistance and made his way back to active service in England.

Tony was the first Australian to fly a jet fighter (in 616 Squadron) and on only his second flight almost killed himself attempting to break the speed of sound in a vertical dive.

When flying a Spitfire XIV he shot down a Me262 jet fighter and later Arado AR234 jet bomber.

At the end of the war he managed to fly several examples of enemy aircraft including the Fw190, Siebel 204 and Me109.
After the war Tony became the first Australian F1 driver and went on to a spectacular career in motorsport."	t5_2uc6j	True

I was nestled in amongst the AI B17's on Bulge, and didn't get noticed straight away. Killed a 109 G6 and another 109. G6 got me on his way down with a lucky hit to the wing with 30mm. 


I don't see any purpose to flying aircraft with ridiculous repair prices when I can be just as effective in other aircraft and be paid similarly.


If I want so desperately to fly a B17 I'll go play IL2. There's no way I'm buying lions simply because the economy/gaijin is trying to herd me into it.


I personally find this an extremely slimy and desperate attempt at making money when other games have shown you can be profitable by just selling cosmetic items.


I was at the Q&amp;A and this is the impression I have from listening to the devs trying to explain away the mammoth repair costs.


Thoughts ?




TL;DR Gaijin has gimped their own game in a grab for profit when other models don't fuck the players around and are profitable.

The track runs right through the map and one train per match.  Each car counts as a separate ground target, with AA guns and armor scaling up with higher tiers.

The lead engine car would have extra armor and if you took it out the train would stop, otherwise it would move off the map in a set amount of time.

The only issue I see is that destroying the tracks would be too complicated to do, and having invincible tracks would be too unrealistic.

Meaning that kills are rewarded much higher than the act of damaging or chasing an enemy plane, therefore promoting kill stealing as a legit way to earn your buck in the game.

While it might have been the case, that in a real war pilots actually mainly got rewarded for killshots, it, in the game, can be immensely frustrating to chase a hard target like a bomber for a few minutes
and through various ammunition belts, only to see it's burning almost-wreckage get shot by some random dude coming over for a quick kill.

World of Tanks for example tackles this issue by rewarding money not for the kill, but for the damage you did to a certain target, still having killstealing as a possibility, but letting it go unrewarded. 

As War Thunder doesn't portrait HP-numbers for obvious reasons, I still think there should be a higher reward for damaging parts of an enemy plane, or even seeing which parts you did damge to.

1372650859.0	1hem7w	I know a lot of us wish for a more friendly, honorable, and sportsmanlike playerbase. Here is an idea I had for a feature that could move the game in that direction.	bejeavis	57	10	42	"This mostly applies to HB/FRB, but it might help arcade a bit too.  Anyway-

Alright, I know everyone has had games where you encounter a teammate or even an opponent doing something unusually awesome.  A guy who makes you say ""yeah this is why I like this game"".  A friendly who flew alongside your bomber and deterred enemies from engaging without receiving a single lion for doing so.  An opponent who let you land and leave your plane.  An opponent who after shooting you down says ""good game"", instead of ""lol wrecked kid, you so mad right now get on my level 360noscopeMLG"".  A guy lands and lets the enemy team get their farm on a bit before he quits a losing game.  Or an opponent who gave you the ride of your life by putting up the most amazing fight you ever saw before exploding into a ball of flames.  Not that cheesey mouse wiggling tree weaving my way back to AAA cover crap, mind you.  I am talking like boss tier ACM.  

These things happen, and you think, ""man, I wish more players were like that"".  Well I think there could be more players like that.  I feel that if players could recognize and reward eachother's random acts of awesomeness, they would become more frequent and the playerbase/community as a whole would improve.  And I like the sound of that.  So I figured out a way that we could reward each other for it.

I call it the ""Salute"" feature.  

Basically, you could open up the stats window during a game, click a player and be given the option to ""salute"" them.  They get a chat message, and a mail message that says ""(player) has saluted you"".  Or you could even type a custom message to go along with it.  Saluting would give the other player a minor reward like 250-500 lions or something.  Small enough to avoid exploitation, and large enough to be significant.  You could also limit it so that you could only salute one player per game.  I guess you could still have clans that just automatically salute each other every game they enter, but seriously, 500 lions isn't going to break the game.

What do you guys think?  Do you guys think that the conduct of the playerbase at large needs improvement?  Do you think this would be effective?"	t5_2uc6j	True

Inspired by a comment by RDDT_Madjack, I'm going to include what I think of the various cockpit layouts. Also, keep in mind that this is my very first flight sim, so I am not the very best player, but have faith! I can reach [Andrei Chikatilo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Chikatilo) levels of murder in most of my games. The posts are going to be separate for each tree, then I will link to them from my FAQ for ease of use for new players. Please note that some planes will fly differently from mode to mode, and I will attempt to note this. As always, if you have something to add, I'd be happy to take a look at it.

**TO BEGIN**!
Freedom is an export, and you are the distributor. Perhaps you're a bloodthirsty young man who joined the Eagle Squadron of the RAF to ""kill me sem Natzis"". Or perhaps you're some poor bastard who got drafted into the USAAF. Whatever the case may be, you're representing **AMERICA**.
    
   I'm not doing reserves because I never play them(you make like 100 lions per kill, or something like that. not worth it), and I'm not going over T7 because I'm not getting paid for this shit.

* **THE SAILING KINGFISHER**   *OS2U-1* and *OS2U-3*


Title says it all. Pretty much useless, even in a reserve match, given its ridiculously slow turn speed. Fun to troll around in, however, on water maps. Get a few friends together and go on a family boating trip. May  be upgraded to 2x 100lb bombs. Useful only in that it leads to better bombers later in the tree. 

*Cockpit*

Can't be bothered for cockpit view because fuck this plane.

* **THE MIGHTY BUFFALO**   *F2A-1* and *F2A-3*

This plane is amazing. It zooms about, swooping and out-turning higher tier planes. It is almost impossible to shake a skilled buffalo pilot once he has decided to murder you. With 4 12.7 mm (thats a goddamned .50 cal) machine guns, it shows a capacity for murder that belies its size. Speaking of size, this plane is so tiny that you either have to be close enough, or directly behind it to shoot it down with any kind of regularity. However, the few rounds that do hit you will quickly turn your plane into future soda cans. 

*Cockpit*

Decent sight all around, ability to see behind you/let a enemy pilot get an awesome **HEADSHOT** voiceover^1. Some blind spots. Completely retarded gun sights. You pretty much have to spray and pray to God/Allah/Satan/WTFE that you hit something. The normal view is a shit iron sight like this thing came out of WW1. [In its favor, it was the first monoplane in service to the US Navy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F2A)

^1 there are currently no awesome voiceovers

* **THE UTILITARIAN CATALINA**   *PBY-5* and *PBY-5A*

The Ultimate Troll Plane, this plane does it all. Boating, flying, bug zapper, there's always something for the [Catalina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_PBY_Catalina) to do. It has a strange bombload. 16 100lb bombs, useful for annoying tanks or bombing suckers on the runway (seriously the best shit ever), 2 battleship destroying [Mark 13](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_13_torpedo) torpedos, 4 500lb bombs, or 4 1000lb bombs. It has a total of 4 gunners on it, comprising of 1 7.62mm x1 gunner on the nose, 2 12.7mm x2 gunners on the sides (which look either like testes, or frog eyes depending on who you ask), and 1 12.7mm x1 on the tail. A huge drawback is that your gunners have the lifespan of a mayfly. It also suffers the gigantic drawback of having a blindspot high on its tail, which is where most fighters like to hang out and kill your gunners. However, some rolling and wiggling about should bring them back into the [danger zone](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KBZCDMIKOk).

*Cockpit*

None, because Gaijin is lazy and drunk and Russian. (bomber cockpits have not been implemented)

* **THE SURPRISINGLY USEFUL DAUNTLESS**   *SBD-3*

The [Dauntless](http://www.boeing.com/boeing/history/mdc/dauntless.page) is an excellent, sneaky dive bomber, great for ending those decades long matches where there is one invincible pillbox/boat. It can also take out larger bombers with its forward facing guns, because it's tough enough to take a couple hits from gunners. The Dauntless' gunner, however, is a certified badass. His/her dual .50 cal on the rear has sent many pilots to their forefathers in Valhalla. It's bombs, 2x 100lb (which drop first) and 1x 1000lb, are perfect for swooping in like a disgruntled pigeon and shitting on tough single targets.

*Cockpit*

A clusterfuck of metal shit. Includes the zoom telescope thing that is in the Buffalo, but thankfully does not utilize it. Sights are a very simple metal circle. Idiot proof. Very difficult (for me) to accurately bomb at anything other than an exrtemely deep dive.

Thanks to the Gaijin crew for saying up to 3:40 AM to answer our questions.  
  
**Q: Will hit stats be added to gamer card?**  
 A: Yes more stats will be added to gamer card and leaderboard etc so you can see how you are improving.  

---
  
**Q: Why was the new variations of P47 and P51 seen on test server not included in 1.31 ?**  
A: They need more adjusting and will be in a patch in the close future.  

---
  
**Q: Joystick improvments for AB ? Some planes are instable in AB like Bf 109 F4, P47 and in FRB they don't show this instability.**  
A: We will look into this. It shouldn't be worse than it was in real life.  

---
  
**Q: Why were the later FM improvements to P-38 and 47 seen on dev server not included in 1.31 ?**  
A: They should have made it over to 1.31.  

---
  
**Q: N1K2 missing its automatic combat flaps (g-force activated) will this be implemented ?**  
A: Post it in the suggestion forum along with your sources.  

---
  
**Q: Will we be able to see some sort of Escort fighter spawn ? (Ie. Spawning at Bomber altitude). As fighters are split between Interceptors and Escort, the current take off mode in battles favours Interceptors. The gained altitude could be balanced by additional fuel**  
A: We will have to talk about game balance etc. Not a bad suggestion and we will think about it.  

---
  
**Q: Why the 128 man limit on squadrons/clan ?**  
A: Technical reason and the guy responsible is not here. Current size will stay for now. [Personal note: My stab in the dark: the database is limited to a 1 byte value for squadron member id.]

---
  
**Q: Both La5 and F4U Corsairs have engines that dies with 1 hit. And oil temperatures of F4U does not go down even if landed or repaired**  
A: Bugged Damage Model it is fixed now. Engine does not die from 1 hit. To kill a radial engine that size it takes 2 or 3 hits from 20mm shells, about a dozen of .50 cal bullet hits or several dozens of rifle caliber hits. As for the overheating make a bug report and we will look into it.  

---
  
**Q: Will xp unlocks be uniform ? (Different planes have different xp required to unlock simimar weapon loads).**  
A: We will change it in future updates.  

---
  
**Q: Does the current FM on P-51D run off Merlin engine or Alison engine? It seems underpreforming at high altitude.**  
A: Merlin  

---
  
**Q: What happened to planes like F9F Panther it seems like it was in the game.**  
A: They were on dev servers but are not ready and need more adjustments.  

---
  
**Q: HB Could fighters with bad climb rate get air start as to not be swarmed by Doras or F4Us ?**  
A: Like said before we will think about an escort start altitude but for now don't climb straight into the combat area, climb to the right or left.  

---
  
**Q: Will we get ability to change crosshair colors? sometimes its hard to see when switching to gunner view.**  
A: Old idea, we will poke the person in charge.  

---

**Q: (FRB) Any plans for seperate profiles/configurations for each planes?. One configuration may be good for aircraft A but not so good for aircraft B** 
A: It is on the job list but its low priority.  

---
  
**Q: Back in Wings of Prey (previous flight game Gaijin worked on) we had many user made skins.**  
A: [*This got to be the strangest answer given in QAs so far*] Borisych: Yes yes we don't doubt your abilites to make beatiful skins but we have limitations from terms of security. Adding or changing new skins is connected to actual gaming data and we are trying to protect you from reverse engineeering of our software. Thats why as far as skins are part of the game in this way. Unfortuntatily we are still looking for a way to make it seperate from game data to allow you to create your own. Untill now unfortunately for us we just cannot allow you do to this because it might harm your computer and in the end your personal data is more valueable. For now we have no instruments/tools to make allow you to do this unfortunately. We have different systems of combining gaming data in one pack then other games thats why there is some restrictions including skins.

---
  
**Q: Obscure IL-10 with turboprop engine was there any data on it ?**  
A: .. Investigating. Ingame we have standard engine for IL-10 the AN42 an improved version of the IL-2 engine with approx 2000 hp.  
  
---

**Q: Some USAAF and British aircraft have ammo racks with ""practice shells"" is this working as intended?** 
A: Ammo guy will post on the forum about this.  Http://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/24271-historically-inaccurate-loadouts/page-8#entry568271  [links to 2 post made in russian and photo attachment regular forum users are not allowed to view]

---
  
**Q: Why after 1.31 when you got rammed by a teammate and your plane gets destroyed and the friendly plane suffers a crittical damage and crashes after 5 secons I get the TK credit penality while the person who destroyed my plane does not.**  
A: Its not easy to automatically understand who did what.  

---

  
**Q: Theres been some discussion lately about F6F-3 Hellcat climbate, is the in-game F6F-3 with or without methanol-water injection system?.**  
A: Will check.

---

  
  
**Q: The recent diary and random trophies. Are they 'random' or actual skill ?**   
A: They will be based on how you preform in the match.  

---

  
**Q: Will squad be adjustable/increased in the future? For instance if a group of 12 people wanted to fly together the current limit of 4 prohibits this.**  
A: There will be additional type of squad which will allow people from sqaudron to play together with bigger numbers than 4 players.  

---

  
  
**Q: In the upcoming economy patch is the repair prices going to be higher then they currently are?**  
A: Yes, this will be ofset by increased income and additional trophy award credits.  

---

  
**Q: (follow up question) Do you think this will affect the player base negatively ?**  
A: The economy update will be bittersweet, it is bitter because of higher repair costs but sweet for lowered plane prices and trophy awards.  

---

  
**Q: With the current way the FM teams are working (International and Russian) there is a lot of talk about bias in game. Could this be avoided by having the two teams work closer together, and perhaps have russian team pass on documents to the international team so that there is better balance?**  
A: Target for both team is to have FMs preform as they were in real life. We will add more forum posts in the future so any one from our playerbase can see what parameters we adjust and how far this is from what you get ingame.  

---

  
**Q: When internal parts get damaged will you change it so that you no longer can pull high g-forces manouvers without breaking up ?**  
A: Yes this is planned. If you for example have a damaged wing spar you will have less durability and can not substain high g-forces in turns.  

---

  
 **Q: Ki-43 is missing self sealing fuel tank and rear pilot protection http://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/16587-43-ii-hayabusa/?p=455859 **
 A: Got any documents for the rear protection plate? [asker: book in polish, can scan and post it on the forums]. We will check it out.  

---

   
 **Q: Are you going to add targets for strategic bombers like B-17, targets like factories, cities, etc ?**  
A: [annoyed voice] yes yes.  

---

  
**Q: Hello guys I loved the recent changes to decals and hangars in general in patch 1.31. However it is still a pain to arrage a pair of jaws and teeth aligned on the nose the right way. Will you guys make it easier to apply the jaws and eyes without straining to align them with each others, prehaps take less slots since no one wants half of a jaw.**  
A: Yes, it was supposed to work this patch we will work on it.  

---

  
**Q: Will squadron leaderbord show winrate instead just number of target destroyed? Any one can go into arcade and rack up massive kill numbers.**  
A: We are working on adding more leaderbords and winrates later on.  

---

  
**Q: Sometimes I experience some sort of bugged hit detection. For example, I clearly can see the impact of a shell with debris falling of the enemy plane without getting any message I hit him. And of course it seems no damage was inflicted. Is this a matter of server I play on or a matter of DM ?**  
A: High ping or packetloss issue. Game (client) renders shell impact  while server judges hits. This explains why you see shells hitting but enemy flying like no damage was done. If it happens without high ping/packetloss issue then  send us replay with logs so we can examine it.  

---

  
**Q: Some times I forget to load TrackIR drivers and notice it lacking after spawning in battle, could we reaquire TrackIR ingame so we don't have to quit and reload the game ?.**  
A: We will look into it as its a custom device smiliar to Oculus Rift and we would like to have  support for this.

---

  
**Q: Suggestion, individual auto repair option for planes.**  
A: We will discuss it internally.  

---

  
**Q: [I didn't hear the question ?? Hit detection ??]**  
A: We have improved and are still working this [?? network protocol ??] you will be able to aim better next update.

1372279931.0	1h4tag	Repair costs are not what you think, they are lower then Pre-Econ Patch	tipsy3000	65	19	64	"Ok First off Id like to thank a guys username whom I cant remember but he posted not to long ago in one of these posts here in /r/warthunder probably shoulda saved his comment but anyways thanks to him!  

Now this little fellow here said something rather interesting as the onset of the Econ patch started up and said something along the lines of ""I dont seem to be repairing the actual repair cost even when im killed"" this perked my interest because I recall in the patch notes something was slipped in, this something was pretty much unnoticed by everyone as they were all bitching about the rep costs.

*""4. After-battle calculation of damage dealt to a plane is changed, now more parameters are taken into account, thus making calculation significantly more precise.""*

This change is not small at all, its a massive change in fact and when I tested this fellow redditors theory, he wasnt wrong, he was right, incredbily right. I took out my D13 to test his theory which has a repair rate of about 15k lions, and upon death in my first battle with it where I bailed out of the aircraft before it crashed, my repair cost was **barely 6k!** So I was scratching my head and not before long I realized that it said ""MAX repair rate"" not ""AVERAGE repair rate"". In the end you only pay 15k for the D13 IN THE WORST POSSIBLE CASE SCENARIO.

With this in mind I decided to collect some data, within 5 deaths in the KI61-C which is a repair rate of 17k lions in HB and keep in mind the old repair cost of the KI61-C was about 21k, this was my result...

B1 : Rep cost : 9702

	 Death type : Pilot Death (Black left wing ; Hull)
	 
B2 : Rep cost : 6197

	 Death type : Plane ram (Black left wing)

B3 : Rep cost : 13884

	 Death type : Fire death

B4 : Rep cost : 13769

	 Death type : Crash (Only Engine remaining)

B5 : Rep cost : 6198

	 Death type : Fire but Bailed out (Black right wing)	 

Bailing out of the aircraft, also known as holding down the J button, actually further reduces the repair cost even if your considered dead with no wing or on fire, etc etc. Crashing or dying by fire seems to produce the most repair costs. But in most cases I never got close to the actual 17k repair cost, in fact, if I bail out before actually dying my repair cost is **MORE then 50% less then what it should be!** In fact its barely a third of the old repair cost!

Now I dont have the time to test every plane to see the repair costs and how it changes with each, but if this is true, the repair rates are actually lower for all planes compared to pre econ patch if you bail out when you know your dead and not stupidly crash your plane into the OP one shot kill ground.

Now this still doesnt answer the problem of some of the retardedly increased rep costs of some planes such as the Meteor F4's 110k rep cost and the Spit IX 23k rep cost along with the G10 outrageos 46k cost, but many planes are actually benefiting from this change in the DM calculations post battle."	t5_2uc6j	True

this guy was giving my position away the whole game because I was flying my b-17 the way it was built to fly.. at high altitudes and the other team was talking shit saying I suck and im a noob. this is how I boycott expensive repair bills and UFO's so sorry if I don't like paying for repair bills

*EDIT* By the way im tired of people saying im dissing the other team firstly the guy on my team that was giving my position away after multiple times of me telling him to stop he insisted to continue and that's when I said I was reporting him than I wrote because of his douchbaggary. so there you have it. also their were Russians on the other team probably using Google translate to call me a noob in loosely translated English to descend saying ""defend the pride of American peoples and come down"" so their you have it I don't want anymore hate comments or people down vote stalking me because they think I started this whole thing I was polite the whole time. the dude deserved to be called a douche who in their rite minds gives away the position of their team? Also! for the people calling me childish for this post you should re evaluate your situation for downvoting ever single post I have made providing the facts to curious players wanting the whole story... people like you ruin communities and make me want to leave reddit. people like you are the immature ""childish people"" We redditors and WT players always get a bad rap for your childish behaviours. also if you think this post is childish look at yourselves calling me a fag/noob/asshole/dick/cunt for using my bomber as intended. and infact I wasent wasting anyone's time I was simply climbing high enough for me to pick them off one by one so they were almost inmanuverable  

TL:DR dropped my bombs on their base in HB and climbed HIGH and teammate gave my postion away

1370953367.0	1g472j	The Economic patch delay	TalismanG1	51	5	94	"[Here](http://warthunder.com/en/news/169/current/) is the official statement, saying that:
&gt;Due to the need to collect a new batch of statistics for the War Thunder 1.31 economy, the pre-planed economy update is delayed.
&gt;
&gt;We're planning to update the game economy in one of the upcoming minor updates that will appear within one or two weeks.
&gt;
&gt;Sorry for the inconvenience.

I wanted to make this before hordes of players start complaining, or before we get 10 posts of screencaps on plane repair costs not being changed.


Moving on, I think that this economic delay is good, although nobody really wants to wait a week longer for cheaper planes. My reason for this is ~~hopefully~~  an even better economy and repair costs. If Gaijin does tell the truth, and they change the prices and repair costs of aircraft that are flown more, or consistently have good results, the Dev server did not offer enough solid information (I think). Considering how maybe less than 1000 people where actively playing at one time, and when they were it was mostly jet users, the information Gaijin was trying to use was probably skewed.

Anyhow, I made this so I could hopefully clarify, or have others clarify better than me, simple ideas and reasons for the economic delay. Also because I really don't want 3,000 people asking//complain//taking screenshots about the economy not changing.

So I loaded a crew up with 17500xp points and went to work.

I won't bore you too much with the detailed numbers suffice to say here are the top 3 most XP hungry skills to max out;

Experienced Gunners (6120xp for 10 gunners - not that you'd need that many) 
Pilot G-Force Tolerance (5620xp) 
Reload Speed (5441xp)

So it all added up to a fully trained Bomber Crew (with only 5 gunners) at 31122xp points - that's 1911 golden eagles if you want to buy. 

A fully trained fighter crew (no gunner skills) is 22540xp points - 1340 golden eagles.

In monetary terms assuming a 5000 golden eagle purchase (British Pounds - convert as you see fit/taxes may vary) of £8.32 for a bomber crew and £5.84 for a fighter crew.

A fully skilled 7 plane hanger (5 fighters, 2 bombers) for instance would equate to about £46.

So there you go, if you are skilling up that way look out the spending will creep up on you. And for those wondering I have 4 maxed out British fighter crews - oh dear.

Hope you're still awake after that. :)

**Q: Will the Italian tech tree be competitive against tier 20 jets?**  
A: (Borisych) There will be italian jet fighters later on. Soon(TM).

---
  
**Q: Camouflages like on P-40 that requires Malta and Mustang Mk.1A that requires Kuban, is there work to make those skins available as those planes don't get matches there ?**

A: (Borisych) There were some changes recently that were not updated, submit a bug report.


---
  
**Q: Recently someone asked about why the Arado-234 is matched against planes it wasn't designed to outrun and according to a transcript that's now missing from the forums (unpinned unofficial transcription of a russian QA).**  

A: (**Borisych**) We had a huge discussion with our russian players about Arado 234. According to our internal statistics from servers Arado is very effective. For instance if we had not limited the game to 20 tiers Arado would be approximately tier 25 [O.o WTF?!].  
(**FM guy**) 24!.  
(**Borisych**) Based on its efficiency in the game. If we down tiered to 14-15 none of the propeller aircrafts would reach it because its a jet. Yes its slower than Migs and Sabres but its faster then regular fighters and this is the point. With its climb and speed its virtually untouchable by any fighter except jets.


---
  
**Q: Have you thought of a different way of ranking? Some planes seems to be ranked too low or too high, like A-20G is rank 5 and is a 1943 plane which outruns every one else on the same level.**
  
A: Yes we are going have to do some changes in our ranking in the future so it will be better.

---
  
**Q: Do you have any plans to increase FRB and HB player base rather then just arcade? Especially in FRB battle ques are fairly long.**  

A: (Alex) When we released open beta test we had 90% arcade players now we have more players moving towards HB so the game is changing. So we have some plans to change FRB which I can't tell about now that should increase FRB players and make it more suited for FRB players.

---
  
**Q: My question is about the US flight models 1.31 we didn't get. Can we look for those in next major update? You mentioned a separate QA for the next major update.**  
  
A: (Borisych) Better suited for the next QA, we will cover all the new stuff then.  

---
  
**Q :Ammo types and general damage using a Corsair I have put hundreds of rounds into a wellington tail gunner turret but he (gunner) didn't die. I only kill gunners by accident not when I aim for them.**

A: (Borisych) We look into it.


---
  
**Q: Do you have any plans to add birds to the game ?**  

A: (Alex) We have thought about it but never gotten around to implement it maybe later. Its not only a question about art, making them look good, animation etc but also about making them behave well. Soon(TM)

A: Soon(TM)


---
  
**Q: [Muted user so I missed his question] ?? New planes ?? Release trees ??**  

A: (**Borisych**) We will update it after the next major update as theres some vitial changes in it right after it we will update the release tree.  
 (**FM Guy**) We will add the Soon(TM) when the official transcription is written.

---
  
**Q: If you hold WEP in P47 you get a reduction in speed is this a bug you know about ?**  

A: (FM guy) We know about this bug we have set up a new Quality Assurance team which we should have done in the beginning really. Their job is to test fly all the flight models on the dev server using all their different controls etc and make sure the aircraft reaches speed, turn speeds, everything and they pass them back as complete or if they have an issue we fix it straight away. So from now on all FMs coming into the game will be pretty much perfect.


---
  
**Q: Are there some plans made to high altitude interception like P-47 and Ta-152. Are we going to see high altitude missions where they can be used to good effect?**  

A: (**Borisych**) We have added new high alt interceptors including MiG-3 so they should have their historical role in the game somehow.  
(**Alex**) High alt interceptors are for intercepting high alt bombers obviously and to make bomber fly at high altitude more we will probably spawn high altitude bombers on bigger altitudes further from the battlefield, we will make something like this in new missions in further development so not next major patch . 


---
  
**Q: A new IL-2 game is coming out, which is bound to attract a lot of soft simmers. What are your plans on retaining and attracting new soft simmers in light of this ?**  

A: (**Borisych**) Be better.  
(**Alex**) We are improving our FRB mode and we will improve it further, we will have more flight models finished. We are improving in game and simulation. 


---
  
**Q: Why does FRB map rotation work the way it currently does?**  

A: (**Alex**) Due to low FRB population so the queuing is done faster, if all nations were available queuing would be slower for everyone.  
(**FM guy**) Every map need to be fully tested in all modes and with low population it just takes longer.

---
  
**Q: On the forums there have been quite a stirrup about german mk108, us 37mm large caliber cannons having problems not doing enough damage or hit registration. What is your view on this?**  

A: (**Slava**) We have not changed anything intentionally this should work as intended.  
(**Borisych**) Submit a bug report with replay and .clog files will make it easier for us to track down possible bugs.

---
  
**Q: US .50 cals seems to be underperforming.**  

A: (**Borisych**) Next update will bring new mechanic to US.50 cal machineguns.  
(**Slava**) Not limited to just US all MGs will be changed. All MGs in general will deal more damage. Americans will have new historical .50 cal ammobelts, pre 45 and post 45 ammobelts.


---
  
**Q: Matchmaker is it working as planned? ATM you have planes from tiers 8-9 joining a tier 4-5 game.**  

A: (**Borisych**) [Lot of gibberish that made little sense.] It takes highest tier plane selected AND nation rank into account.  
(**MM Guy**) [I failed to scribble down his answer but it sounded more reasonable then what Borisych tried to say] Basically lower high tier population gives high tier bit more delta to make matches and it will improve when we get more players.

---
  
**Q: My question has already been answered but could you give more details about coming FRB changes ?**  

A: (Alex) One part is improving the quality of flight models and we know about the visibility issue, we are working on fixing this, changing the missions, how you fly FRB. I can't say more about it now, work in progress.

---
  
**Q: I noticed MiG 15 got the flight model for another MiG-15 it is more like the MiG-15bis.**  

A: (Alex) It should be the MiG-15bis just that it looks like the first MiG-15. If you're asking about Sabres then yes we should have new cool Sabers.


---
  
**Q: Regarding the new testers is there any chance you will accept public volunteers or is it limited to Gaijin staff?**  

A: (FM guy) We have put out advertisment for testers and we have gotten a big response and I just started shortlisting the people today.


---
  
**Q: Back to the matchmaker. Shouldn't the matchmaker disallow more than 4 players of the same clan in the same map? It seems that Match Maker stacks tier 20 jets on one side quite frequently.**  

A: (Alex) MM guy isn't here so wait for the official transcription the answer will be there.

---
  
**Q: Mentioned in previous answer, which new Sabres models?**  

A: (Borisych) Soon(TM)

---
  
**Q: Could we expect major update in the next few month? Which will add new planes.**  

A: (FM guy) We can't talk about future development. Next question !!!

---
  
**Q: I've been playing lot of HB last days but I've noticed a lack of bombers in games especially germans in mid to high rank games. Last patch you would see Heinkels or Dorniers and now you see maybe 1 bomber on german side and it dies in seconds.**  

A: [Wait for the official transcription answer. Too much gibberish sprouted by devs while ignoring constructive feedback from other players].

---
  
**Q: FW-190 cockpit is graphically wrong.**  

A: (Borisych) Its on the todo list.

---
  
**Q: On the FRB forums there has been discussions about having historical plane sets which would push newer users into FRB where it would be easier to play FRB with less than level 5 planes is that something you are interested in doing ?**  

A: (Alex) Yes.

---
  
**Q: Do you plan on role based bonus? Ie. bomber get more more for ground kills then a fighter would.**  

A: (**Borisych**) Yes.  
(**Alex**) When you destroy a ground target with a bomber you get more rewards and less rewards with the fighter.


---
  
**Q: Logbook is not correct do you plan to improve it?.**  

A: (Borisych) Work in progess.

---
  
**Q: Any plans against vultures now the airfield AAs are weak ?**  

A: (**Alex**) Its a general problem for all of us. I'm not sure its weak at least in HB &amp; FRB. I've been shot down by it very often. Players can interact with each other and we want to encourage this so they will be able to cooperate and have some guard the airfield while other reload.  
(**FM guy**) This is the idea with squadrons to have someone to watch your back and protect each other.

**Q: Which is the criteria for planes to be added ?**  

A: (Borisych) Two main criteria 1. Fill gaps we currently have in tech trees. 2. Readiness of models. In next update we will have planes to close gaps in two nations.

Aerial gunnery students fired at these **manned** target aircraft using .30-cal. lead and plastic frangible machine gun bullets which disintegrated harmlessly against the target's external armor plating. Special instruments sent impulses to red lights in the nose of the ""pinball"" aircraft, causing them to blink when bullets struck the plane.

**4) Youtube playlists must be submitted in a self-post (text post) with each video linked individually (preferably with a description). If you are submitting multiple related videos in a short time frame, please use a self-post compilation instead of submitting individual videos.**

This ought to have a three-fold impact:

1. Eliminates clutter from submitters posting multiple related videos (as happened with the recent dev server's reveal of multiple planes at once - several users created videos for each plane).

2. Allows a single flair tag to be used for the batch of videos. Currently, a user might submit a YouTube playlist flaired A/HB/FRB, while the first video (and thus the only ones RES users easily see) might be only Arcade.

3. Allows submitters to describe each video separately, which ought to help give the viewer an idea of what they'll get.

1369497455.0	1f17x8	"Updated Lists Of Custom ""Mini"" Games"	JTPri123	47	7	21	"In the past week or so we've been pumping out these mini game ideas to great success. We have tried many of them and have worked out some kinks on how to make them better. Here is a quick list of what games we've made. We want to share these great ideas will all the players of War Thunder.



**1)**  **David and Goliath aka Biplanes and Bombers:** * This game type has been perhaps our most successful and fun. The name pretty much says it all. On one team there is a series of reserve biplanes, on the other there is one or two B17 heavy bombers. The objective is simple, biplanes must shoot down the bombers, the bombers try to survive. This game type is best done on smaller maps.



**2)**  **Sharks vs Minnows:** * This game is derived from a game in reality usually played in deep swimming pools. There are two teams. One Shark (A Jet or other powerful plane) and a series of Minnows (Biplanes, biplanes everywhere). The Minnows must take off from their air field and land at the enemies air field. The Shark must hunt them all down before they can land. This game is best played on very large maps and an additional Shark may be needed in large games.



**3)**  **Battle Ships:** * This game is rather unique to War Thunder, that being in the sense that there is **NO** flying through out the entire game. The concept is simple, there are two teams in which all of the planes are boat planes. Both teams must maneuver their 'fleets' to engage the enemies with their gunners. The team who sinks the enemies fleet wins the game. This game is best played on a ocean map being that boats don't quite work the same on land. 



**4)**  **Dodge Plane:** * We're still working out the kinks for this game but here's the concept anyways. Dodge Plane is similar to Dodge Ball, the difference being that instead of a ball you use an aircraft. There are two teams. One Biplane (I'm beginning to see a theme here) and a series of very fast planes. The Biplane must dive, turn, and run like hell. From what you ask? The entirety of the enemy team whose sole objective is to ram you going full speed. The Rammers must use the fastest plane they have available, they must maintain their full speed at all times, and they may **NOT** let up on their throttle or use flaps at any time. 



So far that's all we've been able to hammer out, but as I was righting this I happened to get another idea so I might as well share it while I'm here. I call the game Bomb Zone. One player is a bomber with a healthy payload, the rest are small planes (Lets keep that biplane theme). The Biplanes remain within the confines of their airfield where they can drive around and frolic while the bomber will fly to a high altitude and begin to bomb the air field. His objective is to blow up the biplanes with precise drops. The Biplanes, well... They pray and run like hell. Last one alive wins. Best done on maps with proper airfields.



If anyone else has a good idea, share. I will post it on the steam group (Which I highly recommend you folks join. [here](http://steamcommunity.com/gid/103582791434299534)"	t5_2uc6j	True

&gt;Transcript - Director's Cut:

&gt;Will there be selectable ammo choices for gunners?

It is quite logical. We probably have it at future.

 

&gt;Will there be new Jets at next update?

Yes.

 

&gt;Are you considering to reduce the crew's training cost of premium planes?

Premium planes are not better. It is a unique experience. They should be in balance like ohters.

 

&gt;Will we see an addition to the planes, like Gunpods?  Additional machine guns?

There is a possibility. We always respect historical accuracy.

 

&gt;Will there be more information in Encyclopedia about damages, planes etc..?

We will have War Thunder wiki very soon. You should find whole information about everything on there.

 

&gt;Are there any plans to add cockpits to bombers?

Yes.

 

&gt;Situation of Economy?

We are always working on economy. We had radical changes and it is not perfect. We know it. This could scare some players but fear not. We are trying to balance it constantly.

 

&gt;Sub Forums:

 

&gt;French

&gt;Can We have some news about French Planes?

There is no definite answer to this question.

 

&gt;What are the key deadlines of the project?

We cannot say it now. But it will be on time.

 

&gt;What will be the next big update?

We will see it at the end of the month probably.

 

&gt;Magyar

&gt;Are there any plans for greater bombs (500-2000kg) creating craters?

Before implementing ground forces, no.

 

&gt;Are there any plans to create battles with different amount of players? Like between 10-25 players/side depending on the size of the map.

Due to current amount of players, not now.

 

&gt;Are there any plans to create/enable us to define different control pre-sets for different aircrafts/aircraft types? Like a control settings for bomber, another for fighter etc.

Interesting question. We will think about it.

 

&gt;Czeck

&gt;What about PBY-5 Catalina and D &amp; G versions of Ju-87? Both of them lacks part of their defensive armament - PBY-5 Catalina had 2x7,62 mm in nose turret. Ju-87 D3 &amp; D5 had dual-barrel 7.92 mm MG 81Z machine guns in rear defensive position.

 

About Catalina, it is a bug probably. We are on it. Nick also said it, armaments will be implement if it exist in history.

 

&gt;Do you plan to add shooting range or more targets into test flight? I would like to be able to test different impacts before i buy the plane.

There will be additional targets in test flight for sure. Thanks.

 

&gt;Will we be able to open cockpit canopy in future? This feature should be quite usable in FRB.

There is an option to do that but when it will be implement into the game? I do not know.

 

&gt;Chinese

&gt;Have you got a plan about ""Reconnection"" feature? When?

We are working on it.

 

&gt;When will ”guns-targeting-distance“feature be available in Arcade Battle?

Very soon.

 

&gt;Does the Bomb work as intended now?

Yeah they're. We have more accurate bombs according to the their historical ones.

 

&gt;Polish

&gt;Will there be more repaints for airplanes, including skins with Polish insignias or with the others nations?

There will be new options to customize your planes. You can pick some specific nation or squadron skins soon.

 

&gt;Will there be a ""European"" aircrafts nations tree including other European nations in the future (or more as premium aircraft) from Poland for example?

Poland, Italy, France,Finland, Norway made decent contribution to WWII. We are considering to give more space to them. By means of models and skins.

 

&gt;What level of realism we will have in World War mode? Is it possible to have three kinds of level of realism like now (Arcade, HB and FRB)?

Yes. At World War mode, it will be possible to have three kind of realism like now.

 

&gt;Turkish

&gt;Could you give us a sneak peak about World War mode?

No.

 

&gt;Is it possible to play Arcade Battles in a larger map? Like HB's? There is no time to climb at arcade battles specially with bombers.

Probably no. It may badly effect to whole game play of arcade.

 

&gt;Yak-3 literally better than Bf 109 G-10 and it could be accessible way before it. Do you plan to rebalance it?

Yes. We probably raise Yak-3's tier.

 

&gt;Italian

&gt;Any plan to expand the early jet era planeset in the near future ?

Yes.

 

&gt;What about a multicrew option ?

No. We probably will not have this function in the game.

 

&gt;Is the World War mode something close to a MMO with a persistent world ?

We cannot answer this question.

 

&gt;Spanish

&gt;Is there going to be Squadron wars like Clan wars in Wot?

Cannot speak about future plans but probably, yes.

 

&gt;Is there going to be more capacity for players in premium player squads?

It is all about future plans, it may change.

 

&gt;Will be possible to add the squadron tag to nicknames?

No definite answer on it.

 

&gt;Porteguese

&gt;When will full support for ATI Crossfire be available? Question asked by a user with a 4 monitor setup. 3 wide, 1 top for total cockpit immersion.

Not now but it'll be a support absolutely.

 

&gt;Each HB takes too much time... FRB way more time and I need special hardware... What is the point of moving out of arcade if i can also get all the planes ?!

Point is increasing your own skills and progress. More realistic, more professional. It is hard and it is supposed to be support like sport, challenge.

 

&gt;Forgive the disbelief, but will the battle really really really include airplanes, tanks and ships controlled by human players in the same battle?

It is a good answer. But we cannot give any information about future development. We can only answer current situations right now.

 

&gt;German

&gt;I would like to have more targets on the test flight/training mission. This would be a good opportunity to train strafing and bombing runs. Also it would be nice if these targets would reappear after being destroyed.

Yes, there will be more targets.

 

&gt;Can we get a definitive list of finished/unfinished FMs for planes? Knowing which plane has a placeholder FM would help to avoid player disappointment as well as endless discussions about OP/UP planes on the forums and in chat.

That's a good question. We will have to discuss that internally. I think there is good chance that such a list will be published. It will of course only include planes that are already in game.

 

&gt;Today I was flying in a BF110 and was chasing a A-20 (AFAIK Wingspan is 18.69m). When both wingtips touched the revi circle he should have been 180-190m away from me. However the icon readout showed a distance of 460m. Which one is correct? Is the revi set to 1/10 or 1/20 and if it is set to 1/20 will this be changed to the historical correct value?

I will have to check that with the developers, thanks for the tip. My first guess is that the revi circle adapts to the selected gun convergence but that is just that, a guess. If it is an error and not a feature I am sure it will be rectified if possible.

 

---------------------------------- Continue from chat questions--------------------------------

 

&gt;Can we play Tanks and Planes in a same map?

Probably yes. But we are not allowed to answer this kind of question.

 

&gt;Will you increase MG damage of bombers?

Balistics are accurate, also airframes.

 

&gt;If we have a timeframe for FRB in US servers?

We still have not enough players to test it. I cannot give an exact time.

 

&gt;Problem with getting up from ground with Typhoon?

It is probably a bug. We will dig it.

 

&gt;Engine management in HB and FRB seems half implemented?

Yes. In a time you will get more advance controls.

 

&gt;Team-killing?

We are tightly observing TKs and already implemented a modul to punish them to game with last update.

 

&gt;Are you gonna put more maps to Arcade Mod?

Absolutely. We will have Berlin map very soon.

 

&gt;Flight models for P-47 and P-38 FM is dont seem correct?

Yes. We just finished revision of P-47. We will working on it.

 

&gt;When you land in HB without damage you only get re-armed but you do not get an option about fuel. What can be done to that?

Possibly it is a bug. We will work on this.

 

&gt;How about joystick control?

Wait for good changes. Last update introduced advanced joystick controls but we are improving it constantly.

 

&gt;For instance, with my F-86, when I land to airbase to repair ohter planes could shot you down easily. Is there a fix to this?

Unfortunately, it can happen. It is not ethical to shot a pilot in parachute but it happened too.

 

&gt;I can engage tier4 players with my reserve plane. It could be fixed in future?

Sometimes this happen. Because system could merge players from higher levels to start a match. When we have more players at HB and FRB rankings work more effective.

 

&gt;Fjords will be available for FRB?

Possibly, yes.

 

&gt;Will we be able to buy gold with SMS?

Yes. It is still in progress. We had long negotiations with ohter payment operators, we are considering it.

 

&gt;We cant turn of our engines on HB?

Turn of instructor and it will be good.

1376729798.0	1kjj3i	The effect of 1.33 changes to Arcade gameplay	dmh_longshot	46	4	42	"I'm following up from [**my previous post**](http://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/1igmie/why_arcade_has_gone_backwards_since_129/) in which I tried to outline the worst features in 1.31 affecting Arcade and suggest ways to improve them.  As some of these were addressed in 1.33 I thought it was time to analyse the changes and look at what could be done to further improve the game.

In summary, its better than 1.31.  A million miles better.  But its not there yet...

1. Ground Strike - I love the near-total removal of the infamous Gremlins/Barabashka, I love the longer gametimes on many of the maps.  There are only two problems that I see with this mode now.  Firstly, some maps (especially Port) are not designed for the new concept of attacking &amp; support ground targets.  The attackers are all easily accessible to bombing at the outset, so the game is over very quickly indeed - Port in particular is worse than it was with Gremlins.  Secondly, the rules over which units to attack in order to win the battle, and which to leave alone, are far from clear to new players.  Perhaps their target icons could be coloured differently, and text displayed at the beginning saying (for example) ""kill all the orange targets to win the mission"".

2. Domination - The main reason for the parallel ticket bleed introduced in 1.31 was, in the words of Gaijin CEO Anton, ""battle was sometimes won by team, who just have more planes, and not by those who are playing better, which is unfair"".  The ticket bleed forced a shorter game, which stopped players with many slots from spamming superior plane numbers in order to win, but which also resulted in tentative &amp; defensive gameplay that often ended with both teams still flying a full airforce, especially on maps with 2 airfields.  Now the bleed speed is slower, so there's longer games which is great - but hasn't it just allowed the team with more planes to outlast their enemies again?  An easy solution to this problem would be to allow a max of 3 or 4 spawns a mission.  Then no-one would have an advantage of numbers and the ticket bleed would no longer be needed at all.

3. Bombing.  In my previous post I complained of the affect from reducing splash radii, but to this has now been added significantly higher reload costs for anything other than default bomb loads, to the point where even on a good mission you won't make much of a profit from the thankless task of flying a bomber.  Torpedoes are now irrelevant to Arcade, as not only is it difficult to hit targets with them, they often cost more than what you receive as reward for sinking a ship.  I can understand if Gaijin don't want bombers to become easy money trees, but its gone too far in the other direction.  Less bombers in the sky means less heavy fighters trying to intercept them, resulting in shallower &amp; more meaningless gameplay where single engine fighters circle around going for kills, while shouting ""Attack the Ground Targets"" to their team-members.

4. Rewards encouraging teamwork.  The lack of teamwork in Arcade has been known &amp; commented on for a long time now, and my last thread had many recommendations and suggestions from other posters on how the rewards structure could be improved to encourage players to work together and go for mission objectives.  I'll repeat what I said last time: ""Right now all the rewards go to players who kill other planes, with minimal lip service rewards for assists etc, or for playing to the misison's objectives. The economy also rewards ""staying alive"", which is the antithesis of taking risks to win the battle for your team. The result, as anyone who plays AB can verify, are trains of fighters jostling each other as they chase an isolated enemy. It rewards selfish behaviour at the expense of your team. Suggestion: Make assists &amp; criticals worth almost as much as kills, and show assists on the stats board. In addition, please reward playing to the objectives: in Ground Strike provide high rewards for rescuing and conversely shooting/assisting bombers and ground targets, in Domination provide high rewards for rescuing fighters, for capping enemy bases or making enemy bases neutral (these last two are usually suicide missions and should be rewarded appropriately).""  To Domination I'd add a proximity-based award for other nearby players when an enemy field is capped, rather than all the spoils going to the one plane that secured the cap.

To point 4 I'd also add making the bonus for winning the mission either the current XP/SL reward, or a 3X multiple of what the player scored in the mission - whichever is greater.  Right now, the difference in reward between winning and losing just isn't great enough to make many players care that much.

Unfortunately nothing has been done at all, as far as I can see, to reward and encourage players to go for objectives in Arcade or to work together instead of trying to compete with team-mates. Until this happens, the majority of arcade players won't see any reason why they should put their planes on the line for their team, and selfish play will continue to be the norm.  Players are only doing what the current reward system tells them to do - get kills and stay alive - and that's working to the detriment of overall gameplay.

TL;DR - arcade's improved, but its still a long way from ideal, and there's obvious improvements Gaijin can make."	t5_2uc6j	True

1373645588.0	1i5s4b	Everything we know about ground vehicles	I_kill_ch1ldren	48	7	72	"**General information**

* First, there will be battles with ground forces only, with no player-controlled aircrafts. Further the interaction and cooperation between the different types of forces (air, naval and ground) will be encouraged and planned to be one of the aims in missions.

* First and foremost there will be the Soviet and the German research trees. Other nations will be in a way Italy present in German tree now. In future other nations will get their own research trees.

* First of all, there will be tanks, self-propelled anti-tank and assault guns. Other types of vehicles - as soon as Gajin figure out their gameplay.

* The basis of the ground forces will be mass-produced vehicles. Prototypes and paper models to be used in extreme cases.

* One of the options to resolve the issue of the lack of high-tiered tanks in some nations - implementing upgraded specimens of existing types of vehicles. Example: Tiger II with a 105 mm gun (original caliber gun - 88 mm). Gun existed, was a prototype of the gun turret for the gun, but the tank was not upgraded.

**Planned**

* Dependence of fire behavior from the ignition source (oil, powder charges, etc.)
* Possibility to blow up the external fuel tanks
* The possibility of shell explosion inside of the barrel of a tank
* The possibility of shooting off the barrel of a tank
* The possibility of detachment of the tank gun turret with a successful hit
* Interchangeability of the tank crew. Injured crew member could be replaced with other, but his job performance could be sloppy (for example – he can forget to change gears at the time)
* Virtual instructor (gunner) in arcade mode (counts level of elevation of guns)
* Night missions (with artillery star shells, possibly night vision and infrared lamps)
* Smokescreens
* Destructible buildings (most of them), the visual damage to the rest
* Sightseeing of Berlin :) 
* Simulation of the suspension: patency depends on the type of soil, the physical size rollers affect the behavior of the tank
* Modular damage system
* The spread of fire in/on the tank
* Ability to knock opponents off the cliff, turn the tank upside down
* Accounting level of elevation of a barrel when firing
* Compliance with the potential range of the weapon with characteristics of real guns / ammunition (10 kilometers – is not the limit, but shooting at such distances without adjustment is not rational)
* Possibility to shoot down the plane of the main gun of the tank (in the case of hit)
* On-screen armor as a modification of tanks, visual display
* Visual display of damage, detachment of external components in case of hit (lights, tools, etc.)	
* Shooting from the all of the tank weapons (guns, machine guns), multi-turrets
* Physics of ricochets, penetrations, material accountancy and quality of armor
* Detailed terrain
* Virtual Assistants in arcade mode
* Camouflage system

**Under question**

* Player controlled artillery
* The model of collision and damage to main tank guns in contact with other objects
* Activation method of extinguishment (passive skill or button)
* Amphibious tanks

**Extra**

When devs were asked: ""Will there be Maus?"" – Devs answered nothing (at all).


In addition, the developers noted that the markers on the vehicles greatly affect the character of a tank battle (stronger than in the case of aircraft battle).

Do not forget to keep an eye on tanchiki (russian hypocorism for tanks), armored car and cars, that ride beneath your wings. This vehicles is gradually changing, becoming more diverse and detailed. Here is [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8YlDm7uvvw&amp;feature=player_embedded) where you can see most of the ground vehicles present in game right now.

1368037632.0	1dy31p	Russian stream: sneak peak about next major update	Muleo	51	10	148	"Today on the Russian stream, some of the developers were playing and talking about some of the features in an upcoming major patch, here are some of the highlights:

**New Arcade maps**

There will be two new arcade maps. 32x32km Ireland (ground strike with ships and ground vehicles) and 16x16 Africa (ground strike with ground vehicles)

**New Planes** 

* Yak-15 and Yak-15p 
* P-36 Hawk (a lot of modifications ready, some of them will be put in game in the patch) 
* Mig-3

**Clan system and Squadrons**

* Tags (no longer you will need to change name when you switch clan!)
* Ranks inside the clans
* Full Clan UI – their own page with descriptions, logo, motto etc. (Logos in future could be used as decals on your planes, but not from the start.)
* Squadrons will be possible to use during tournaments, more of which are planned for the future.

**New UI**

Complete rework of the UI in the game. A lot of stuff will be better and easier to use. You won't need keyboard to use new UI – it will be possible to click on needed buttons to do something (like turn on decals, switch them etc).

**Streaming from in game**

You will able to stream directly from in game without using additional software!"	t5_2uc6j	True

http://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/22962-economy-v129-upd/page-47#entry273751

Quoted for those of you who do not have accounts

&gt;No hot leaks, i'm giving you facts. What is F2P now, without spending a single dime

&gt;1. The economy model change was inevitable for a number of reasons. There will be no 1.27 economy anymore.

&gt;2. Changes in the income are mostly for 0-12 levels. As you can see from tables in the OP, farming lions on lvls 3-6 is not so profitable now. No more aces farming lions in 0-3 lvl sandbox (we had more than 25% of players doing this before the 1.29). On the contrary, the most profitable planes now are 8-11 levels (really, try it!). Check the income bonus percentage for every plane, and you see what I mean.


&gt;3. Income for 12-20 lvls remained almost the same. Really strong planes (top-tiers and jets) could be played in 'plus' only by skillful pilots. It's normal. We don't want dozens of MiG-15 in every battle. Playing the strong plane is challenging, even with premium. Fair enough, don’t you think?


&gt;4. Income is growing from level to level for all players of any skill from 0 to 10th level.


&gt;5. You won't play in 'minus' till levels 10-12 now. If you're newcomer, ask more experienced players, what they had before 1.29 starting from 7-8 levels, ask about repairing costs in percentage of income. This is over now. Even totally unlucky and failed battle will bring you some lions. Your personal combat skills are not so valuable before ~10-12 lvl, you may fly bad and still earn - it just takes more time.

&gt;6. You may easily develop and buy one branch of a tech tree from 0 to 12 lvl in accordance (more or less) to your XP level. New level - new plane. No some extraordinary combat skills required for this. Want more planes, more branches of the tech-tree, new skills for your crew (qualification) - play longer, or play better, or buy Premium. Fair? Fair.


&gt;So, speaking in general: Do we think, that’s new economy is about how things should be now - yes, we do. There will be changes - more or less obvious - in gameplay (accordingly, in economy), there will be fixes and corrections, of course, but the whole idea will remain for now.

So, it looks like the new Hitlerbux economy is here to stay.  I have to say that with the recent changes to Lions, even with **Premium** this grind is now more painful than shoving a Xtreme 3D Pro up my ass.  I'm seriously considering just quitting the game at this point, because with this nerf Gaijin is basically requiring that at some point down the road, you are going to have to purchase Lions (that is unless you have 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to grind out Lions).

Then 1.29 dropped and significantly reduced the value that cash has in the game and now I have no inclination to do so. 

People say, ""well it's Beta, things are going to be changed"" which leaves the paying gamers in a strange position. On one hand, I recognize the need to support the developers and have a genuine desire to do so, not just to get the cool shit I want but also because I want this game to be successful on a broad scale.  On the other hand, how are we as paying customers supposed to feel and react when changes are made that significantly reduce the intrinsic value of our money, both on future purchases and perhaps more importantly in this case, retroactively for currency ""sitting in the bank"". How is one to have any level of confidence and expectation of value if the economy model for a F2P style game can be altered on a whim, not as a result of some external market forces, but simply because the devs want to try and  generate higher ARPU? 

Admittedly, this is one of the first F2P games I have spent any amount of time with so I'm not really sure what to expect. I can't help but think the economy model is something that could have been developed and tested in a spreadsheet well before any actual game design work. All this nonsense of having multiple in-game currencies that can be converted seems to be designed to intentionally try and obscure how much money is actually being spent and disguise what is essentially a subscription-based game as a F2P game. I'm curious to know how much the developers feel one should pay to be able to enjoy this game in its entirety. 

Anyway, sorry for the wall of text but I needed to rant. "	t5_2uc6j	True

To get the ball rolling on sharing some of those, here's some regarding landing and repairing :    
- If you're coming in a little hot then lowering your gear and landing flaps will help, alongside this try fishtailing with your rudder (Q &amp; E with classic controls) to further bleed speed.    
- After landing once the repair timer is active you can move around the runway without resetting it - just don't take off. To do this throttle gently and control your direction with the rudder. This can be useful if you've landed but the enemy is attacking.    
- After you have repaired you can leave your aircraft, either by holding J or from the menu, and then re-select any of your line up or indeed the same plane. The advantages to this are several :    
you start with altitude and speed, getting you back into the action much faster.    
you avoid that take off period of being a sitting duck.    
you can change plane if appropriate.

Hans-Joachim Marseille shot down 151 planes before dying in a crash in 1942.
Almost all kills were over Africa:

    101 Curtiss P-40 Tomahawk/Kittyhawk fighters;
    30 Hawker Hurricane fighters;
    16 Supermarine Spitfire fighters;
    Two Martin A-30 Baltimore bombers;
    One Bristol Blenheim bomber; and
    One Martin Maryland bomber.

It was hard for me and at the end I learned quite a lot about specific plane therms and some other things, but knowing them on russian is one thing and picking word from 10 suggestions from dictionary is another.

I see a lot of people struggling to get information that is actually very easy to get if you can read russian forums. I will try my best to translate questions that developers answered on russian forums and will provide links on topics. I really bad at translations, though, so bare with me. If you will notice mistakes in translation – please, post it in comments so I will fix it. I hope someone will find it useful. 

[Answers from Devs from 11.03.13.](http://forum.warthunder.ru/index.php?/topic/39388-4-otvety-ot-razrabotchikov-strogaia-moderatciia/ )
&gt;**Question 1** At the moment differences between the original aircraft and the polished ones with new engines are not noticable. Are there any plants to change it?

The difference is in there and you can check it with measurements. Its not a 50% boost to speed, but really a specific improvement of how engines work.


&gt;**Question 2** Will the damage model from collisions with trees or parts of enemy planes be different from taking fire?

We are constantly improving our damage model, including visuals.


&gt;**Question 3** Are there, at least in a hidden way, HP on the modules or is everything is random?

There is no randomness. If you get hit in the engine – the bullet will deal the damage which it should do: armorpiercing, igniting etc.


&gt;**Question 4** Will the damage model be improved when the planes perform head-on collision?

Yes 


&gt;**Question 5** Will you implement a wind in Historical Battles with the carriers?

Wind is present even now, but there is no dynamical change of it enabled just yet.


&gt;**Question 6** How many players game can support? Is arena for 100 or more players possible?

Technically, game supports more than 32 players. Its designer limitations just yet.


&gt;**Question 7** Are there any chance for historical and real battles to be balanced by years of production?

It depends on many factors, but we considering this possibility.


&gt;**Question 8** Are there any plans for more difficult fighting scenarios (escort, delivery of the goods etc)?

We always test new game modes, but which of them will get to release – we cant tell.


&gt;**Question 9** Are there plans for improving old ones or adding new maps for Historical Battles?

In current ones all mistakes will be fixed.


&gt;**Question 10** Will there be possibility to share awards in squads?

Good idea, but it also open possibility to level up bots.


&gt;**Question 11** Will Release Tree be created in game fully or there already some changes made in it?

There is no plans to change it yet.


&gt;**Question 12** How often do maps change in Historical Battles?

As soon as previous one is tested enough.


&gt;**Question 13** Will there be unusual equipment for the planes released (trolleys for taking off, rocket accelerators)?

There will be, but not those that was mentioned.


&gt;**Question 14** Will there be possibility to damage your plane while controlling gunners manually?

No.


&gt;**Question 15** Will bi-planes be moved to different game mode (for people who like aviation of that type)?

No.


&gt;**Question 16** Will there be fixes to outside sounds from cockpit?

We dont know about problems with that. Do a bug reports – we will fix it.


&gt;**Question 17** Will jamming of pylons and knots on hight speed be realized? 

Most likely no.


&gt;**Question 18** Early jets will still be matched with late ones or they will be matched with piston aircrafts?

Matchmaker constantly being worked on.

&gt;**Question 19** Will bombs and rockets be falling out during system failures, direct hits etc?

Not yet.


&gt;**Question 20** Will Do-217 have radio bombs?

Not yet.


&gt;**Question 21**Will we be able to fill ammo belt by ourselves, not by premade setups?

Yes, we thinking about that possibility.


&gt;**Question 22** Will research tree look like release tree on the website?

No. One thing – interface, and another – picture.


&gt;**Question 23** Will replay player change (scrolls, views, pause)?

We have pause even now, scrolling planned. 


&gt;**Question 24** Are the any planes to expand language pack of the game? If yes, can we see Ukrainian localization in future patches?

We are working on it, we already have 9 languages. About Ukrainian localization – I cant say when it will be done.


&gt;**Question 25** Will there be more flight characteristics shown, in particular weigh of the rockets?

We will show player more information.


&gt;**Question 26** Will bomb aim be redone to its historical look?

Yes.


&gt;**Question 27** Will after-battle statistic and statistic for individual planes be more detailed? 

Yes.


&gt;**Question 28** There is Encyclopedia in game. Will bomb, rocket, torpedo descriptions be added in it?

Yes, surely. 


&gt;**Question 29** Any plans on landing lights (cant see anything on night maps, especially the ground)?

Yes, but we cant say when it will be done.


&gt;**Question 30** Will there be more decals and icons added?

Yes.


&gt;**Question 31** Are you gathering any statistic about how many players are using joystic/mouse and what is their efficiency with it?

Yes.

1372452711.0	1h9t39	[TL;DR ALERT!] My thoughts on Heavy Bombers	wrel_	43	7	58	"I’m a fan of strategic bombing, so I’ve tried many times to justify playing as a heavy bomber in War Thunder, I really have.  But every time I do, I realize it’s a fruitless endeavor while trying to play with the current game structure.  I’m by no means an expert in the matter, but here are some key flaws that I have found that really prohibit someone from playing as a heavy bomber. (For a frame of reference, I’m going from experience that’s a 75%/25% split of Arcade/HB in mostly B-17s or B-25s.)


- Lack of Survivability

It’s an unavoidable fact, so let’s get it out in the open: heavy bombers are a target.  B-17s, B-25s, Wellingtons, He 111s, on and on.  When people see one, they target it.  It’s big, it’s slow, and in the current game model, it’s fragile.  Recent patches have strengthened multi-engine planes, but it appears that only manifested itself as strength against collision/rams and bullets that are .50 caliber and lower; cannons still take them apart.  They can last a bit longer in HB because the enemy doesn’t know at the start of the match if there is a heavy bomber present, but in arcade mode, there’s a kill train waiting to find you.  

As a heavy bomber, you have two main forms of defense: altitude and your gunner crew.  Altitude is an easy one, but it takes a while for you to get to a good one.  It’s also a minor thorn in the side to come down from altitude in HB to rearm your plane, as the maps are big, but not realistically big enough to allow for a steady descent without building a lot of speed.  The real problem though, is the gun crew.  Even fully maxed out, bomber gunners aren’t very intimidating.  When attacking a bomber, I’ve never once said “this is going to be rough…” when I went in for my strafing run.  You usually know when they start shooting and where the tracers are coming from, and can easily move along their arc to avoid them.  They are more formidable in HB, but in arcade they are a joke.  It’ll take ~5 good, solid hits to knock someone out, and they certainly aren’t going to just fly straight and level and let your .50 cal gunners tee off on them.  And in it’s current state, manual gunning is beyond broken.  Arcs of fire don’t work right, and the aiming reticle is a joke.  You have a better chance of letting the AI blast away and getting a hit than if you switch to the gun yourself.

All-in-all, you can’t out-climb, out-run, out-turn or out-gun the fighters looking to knock you out of the sky.   You can hope they don’t see you, and when they do, hope they ignore you, and when they don't, hope they can’t climb as high as you, and when they can,  hope that your gunners can ward them off, and when they can't, they fire a few 20mm rounds through the wing send you to your death very quickly.  That is bad.


- Lack of Offense

This might be more applicable to the Arcade matches I’ve played, as there isn’t a lot of base-bombing that takes place in HB matches, but heavy bombers lack a reliably sufficient offense to cripple the enemy base.  In World War II, it took hundreds of bombers dropping thousands of bombs to reliably destroy designated targets.  This was mostly a technology limitation, as they were dropping unguided bombs through cross winds, and before the invention of the Norden bombsight.  It feels that War Thunder chose this type of bombing approach when it comes to the potency of strategic bombing.  I can take my B-17 with its 16x 500lb bombs, fly right down the heart of the enemy runway and drop everything I have and have them all hit home, and I’ll still need to make three or four more passes with a full bomb load before I’ve actually bombed the base out.  Granted you could coordinate with some people, and have three or four players fly their heavies in formation to totally ravage the air field, but that takes us back to the previous point that bombers are a target.  If one B-17 draws in two or three eager fighters, imagine how many people will flock if they see a bomber box moving across the map.  

These two problems are essentially in a symbiotic relationship with each other, and I feel they come out on the short end of the stick in both cases.  A ‘lack of offense’ might not be a problem for a bomber if it was allowed to make three or four runs at an enemy base.  But it can’t.  And the fragile existence of a bomber might not be a problem if they were allowed to get to the target and cause serious mayhem, given the chance they will only have time to make one pass.  But they aren’t.  You’re kind of playing with a deck stacked against you, in that you’ll need to survive multiple interceptor attacks *and* make several runs as your target.  That’s what I find so inherently discouraging about strategic bombers.  Which takes me nicely to my final point.


- Lack of Strategic Targets

Forgive me for being patronizing here, as I’m sure a lot of you might know this next bit, but some people might not.  Tactical and strategic targets are different things.  I don’t want to get too into the nitty-gritty semantics, but for an easy way to think of it is “destroying a tactical target will win the battle, destroying a strategic target will win the war”.  A tactical target could be a column of enemy tanks headed to flank your ground forces, while a strategic target would be the steel mills and factories where the tanks are made.  Destroying the tank column will win the battle, but destroying the ability for the enemy to make more tanks will win the war.

With that said, other than enemy bases, there aren’t any strategic targets that require strategic bombers.  Most ground targets are tanks, AA vehicles, patrol boats, destroyers etc.  Small, mobile targets that are *far* lower than your bomber will be flying.  It’s almost impossible to hit them, because of the travel time your bombs will have.  Granted there are AAA nests and pillboxes, but these targets are all tactical targets, which are ideally suited for fighter-bombers like P-47s or IL-2s that can zoom in, get low and dive, pickle off their bombs and pull away.  A B-17 is not suited to be slaloming left and right, dropping 1,000 pounders on targets that will most likely be killed by allied fighter-bombers who can get there a lot faster than you can.  As a heavy, you’re left with the enemy base in Arcade battles, and depending on the HB you’re in, a bridge, an aircraft carrier, something small not all that meaningful in a game mode that has devolved down to a dogfighting race between players.  And atop all that, these targets are worth very little, income-wise.   

The Battle of the Bulge HB has the right start of an idea, where B-17s are incoming and need to be protected.  But they rarely are, because again, it’s usually player vs player in a race to kill everyone off so the game ends sooner.  If there were more targets that you could go after and actually influence the game outcome, I think it would be a much more attractive option for players to fly their bombers.  Maybe make a map where the heavies can focus on supply lines and refineries, while the fighter bombers go low and take out tanks and enemy pilots.  Maybe if you can damage these supply lines, enemies are handcuffed while trying to repair or rearm at their base.  Maybe if you destroy the refinery, planes in the air start losing fuel and can’t stay aloft as long.  Something that will split the attention away from a mass rush to boom and zoom in the middle and once your whole team is dead because they are stupid, in comes a lonely Wellington who gets trained by all the fighters looking for the last kill.  And make these strategic targets rewarding to damage.  I realize flying a slow circle over a target at 28,000 feet dropping bombs isn’t as exciting as the furball at 2,500 feet in the middle, but make it at least rewarding for the people who are willing to do it to give their team an advantage.  Getting “Base Damaged” and 850 lions a couple times each map is hardly worth getting your wings blown off by a bored P-63.


So that wasn’t too bad, was it?  (Of course it was, this is the internet.)  If you stuck it out this long, then you probably have some comments and ideas of your own on the subject, and I’d love to discuss them with people.  As I said when I started all this, I really want to like playing as a heavy bomber.  But I think things really need a fix before we’re allowed to.

thanks to the tireless efforts of /u/Muleo, our little corner of all things aerial warfare now has a completely revamped stylesheet.

You'll notice quite a few things have changed! Don't worry though, nothing has been removed, we've only moved things around. Your usual reddit tabs (hot/new/rising, etc.) have been moved to the top right, for example.

1. **The Menu Bar**. At the top, you'll now see 5 tabs in the semi-transparent menu bar. Each of these has a drop-down category! This neat way of sorting information was inspired by /r/starcraft's sleek stylesheet.

2. **The FAQ** gets a nice position of honor. Wokaslasher's great Frequently Asked Questions post is currently the only subcategory there, but the FAQ tab may be expanded later.

3. **In the near future: Filters**. Expanding upon my previous discussion of the tagging system, this will be rolled out in the near future to help people browse game-mode-specific content.

4. **Links** here you'll find the same set of links previously found in the sidebar. The sidebar was growing too cluttered, so this really cleans it up. We'll be adding more here soon.

5. **Weekly Discussions** are now easily viewable in their own tab. The bolded subtab denotes the current discussion.

6. **Tactical Guides**, a new category meant for improvement of players' tactics. It is recommended you check some of these out.

If you have any suggestions for menu bar tabs, shoot away!

http://forum.gaijinent.com/index.php?/topic/15833-where-are-all-the-american-flag-decals/



For those of you who would rather not click the link:

Look, as an American, I can make this clear to everyone here: there is only one thing in the world that all Americans care about and that is American flags, alcohol, and guns. I've been flying American planes during my stay on War Thunder because I feel that is the only way to play the game, considering America is the only country playable that has actually won any of these world wars that have happened. You might say that the United Kingdom and Russia technically won the wars as well, but only by technicalities. Either way, that is beside the point and irrelevant.
 
The point is that there are no American flag decals. How am I supposed to show off my patriotism without being able to cover my plane in American flags? How am I supposed to support my country if I cannot cover my planes with American flags? Sure, I can cover my planes in stars (which I have), but that just isn't the same thing as flying in a flag covered plane. As an American, I feel that this is very important for the War Thunder market to expand into America. All I'm asking for is a simple American flag decal. We've earned the right to fly our digital flags on our digital planes after becoming back to back world war champs.
 
I'm not asking for a huge change in the game, just a small one to help Americans be a little more patriotic in a game so destitute of Americans.
 
While I'm at it, I've also compiled a list of other possible changes to help the game remain historically accurate:

* American planes fly around with a large American flag being dragged behind them.
* American planes explode into red, white, and blue smoke when shot down.
* Rounds shot from American planes are now shooting stars.
* American planes with the American flag decal are invulnerable.
* Add Hiroshima as a playable campaign mission and include atomic bombs.
* Whenever an American plane scores the final blow, the entire Star Spangled Banner is played before players can leave the match.
* Whenever an American plane scores the first strike, the Star Spangled Banner plays throughout the match.
* American planes can never be placed on opposite teams in arcade mode.
* Players who choose Japan must apologize for Pearl Harbor at the start of each match before being allowed to spawn.
* American pilots also all have assault weapons that they can take out and shoot from the pilot seat when they are reloading their weapons because the Assault *Weapons Ban wasn't instituted until 1994.
* All American planes renamed to Freedom. For example: P-40E-1 Freedom, A-20G Freedom, etc.
* When American bombs explode, it is in a cloud of red, white, and blue smoke and also launches fireworks into the air that form into an American flag. Any non-*American planes that fly through the flag explode.
* Players who shoot down American planes are fined all of their current silver lions (out of respect).
* The end of all matches should fade into an American flag waving in the wind, because we did win both world wars and everything.
* France is never a playable nation.
* Canada is also never a playable nation.
* Any references to France in the game are removed, aside from America bravely saving France.
* Players can choose Sonic the Hedgehog to pilot all of their planes (I just really like Sonic).
 
That's all I have to suggest. Thanks for reading and taking my suggestions into consideration.

1372760776.0	1hhm48	On the P51-D's In-Game Performance...	lordfuzzywig	41	8	86	"50% legitimate concern, 50% rant *(just had an La5 chase me up to 3km after I dove from 4.5km and climbed at 750kph back up when he was low energy, so I'm nerd-mad)*. I mainly just want to know if there's something I can do to bump up its performance, or if it's actually just a crap plane in the game.

I've had the P51-D for a while now. I love it. I love everything about it. It was the one plane I was looking forward to having in the American tree. But because of the previously-broken FM, I shelved it. It's not worth the 20.000L repair bill when it's outperformed in every way by every other plane in the game* (even, to some degree, biplanes).*

So I went and did some looking.

Here are some stats from various websites regarding the P51's performance:

**Maximum Speed ASL 358mph = 576kph.**

    At 3KM (10k ft) 
    437 mph = 703.2 kph

    At 7km (25k ft)
    325 mph = 523.03 kph

    3475 feet per minute climb = 17.6m/s

And I've only found stats that actually indicate that these numbers might be on the low end. Why does the P51 literally struggle ASL in-game to even reach 400kph when Emils, Friedrichs, and Gustavs, Tonys, Yaks, and almost every other low-tier plane not only reach that speed easily but also maintain that speed with literally no effort required?

The Me109F4, for example, easily reaches speeds exceeding 600kph without hesitation in a combat situation with no WEP activated.
     
    Low blower operation man. press ""Hg 60.5, 3540 fpm climb 2.8min to 10000 ft.

    To 20000 ft at Combat Power, 4.58m.

Turn times were reported to be about three seconds longer than FWs and similar planes, but its roll rate was superior to almost any plane in the war with few exceptions.

Here are some graphs to illustrate the point.

http://www.wwiiaircraftperformance.org/wade-comp-perf-chart1.jpg

http://www.wwiiaircraftperformance.org/wade-turning.jpg

http://www.wwiiaircraftperformance.org/wade-dive.jpg

http://www.wwiiaircraftperformance.org/mustang/mustang-level-150-2.jpg

http://www.wwiiaircraftperformance.org/mustang/mustang-level-67.jpg

So the question is why is this plane so awfully under-represented? **Is the FM still broken? If so, why?**

Why is a Buffalo literally a better, more versatile choice, and why is the Mustang outperformed by it? The Yak-3, for example, which I feel has a fairly complete FM, has a max speed of around 410mph (650kph) and this is actually pretty accurately modelled so far.

The Mustang was highly regarded as one of the best planes of the war, mainly because of its long-range capabilities, but also because of its extreme maneuverability. So why (and how) is it outperformed consistently at literally EVERY ALTITUDE -- even its sweet spots at 3km and 7km! So I guess the question remains... Why is this plane in particular so gimped?

tl;dr just click the graphs and look at how the P51 should be performing to how it compares in-game.

*EDIT: I am aware that the first graphics are of the Mustang III. I am also aware that the P51B is lighter, as is the Mustang III than the P51D. However, the performance discrepancies are minimal when you consider that we're talking much larger numbers than the 50kph difference in performance between the different models of Mustang.*"	t5_2uc6j	True

This post is going to detail the RDDT squadron's road map of milestones and events we want to accomplish. These are things we need help with, so if you're interested in anything below let us know by volunteering as an officer in the election we'll be hosting next week.

**1. Organization**

We're accepting everyone who applies to join to be a member of Reddit. We are an inclusive Squadron open to all just like this subreddit, but as a member you must keep in mind the expectations that will be placed on you for how you act in a game. We will not tolerate trolling by any members within the game- anything that is intentionally preventing someone else from enjoying the game. 

Once we near the membership cap for the squadron, we will create a secondary squadron. These will be organized by region (US and EU) to let the members plan their events at more convenient times for each other. These and any additional squadrons will be under the umbrella of the RDDT clan (technically a Wing once we have multiple squadrons). 

[**Here's a graphic example.**](http://imgur.com/a/kDTkU)

We will be holding elections on the sub for anyone who wants to volunteer to be an officer. Officers will be managerial positions within the Squadron that are responsible for coordinating the members of the organization and running or keeping tack of those volunteers who are running the below events. 

****

**2. Gaming Events**

We plan to eventually offer all of the following- but we need help to organize and run them. Please let us know if you're interested in helping with any of these.

* Inner-RDDT tournaments and Open-to-anyone tournaments (Arcade, Historic, AND Full Real)
* Custom Events- Inner RDDT and Open (Historic and Full Real)
* Tactical-focused Custom Battles
* Organized matchmaking squads
* Flight school
* Monthly gaming challenges (EX. Get 3 air kills and 5 ground kills without dying in a match).
* Flying guides for all the planes and maps.
* FRB demo teams
* A wingman system for RDDT events- rank up by proving your flying skills to be promoted to a flight leader!
 
****

**3. Future Growth**

We are looking into the feasbility of doing the following:

* A private RDDT teamspeak.
* Gaijin-sponsored contests, competitions, and tournaments.

****

Lastly, if you have a suggestion for something you want to see done, please post it here! Sign ups for the squadron are open, and elections will be coming soon!

I thought I'd get the ball rolling from /u/RDDT_snafu_52 's suggestion [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/1evknx/all_or_other_rddt_air_wing_fun_nights_custom_game/ca49vyr) to get a custom HB going. Tonight we're going to do a custom battle 10v10 to try it out- rules are up in the air right now so if you have suggestions you're welcome to put them forward. Custom battles don't give or cost any lions, but you do need to repair your planes before entering in order to use them.

To start off:

* When: 9PM Eastern TONIGHT

* Where: The RDDT teamspeak

* Scenario: Battle of Midway (US vs Japan) 10 vs 10, HB difficulty level, Mouse Aim allowed

* US Planes Allowed (historically present): 
   1. PBY Catalina
   1. SBD Dauntless
   1. TBF Avenger
   1. F2A Buffalo
   1. F4F-3 Wildcat
   1. F4F-4 Wildcat

* Japanese Planes Allowed (historically present): 
  1. A6M2 ""Zero""
  1. A6M3 ""Zero""
  1. A6M2-N ""Rufe""
  1. D3A1 Dive Bomber ""Val""
  1. B5N2 Torpedo bomber ""Kate""

We'll see how many people we get and divide the teams, I''ll create the custom battle and we'll go from there. We'll play one game, swap sides for another game, and then get a consensus if we want to adjust any rules, keep playing Midway, or change anything up. More details to come regarding game password, I'll post in in TS for those who show up.


Edit: There is an ability to allow multiple crews to be used in the match, with re-spawns after death. We could enable this if there is interest, as long as you use the base 3 crews and equip them with the planes listed above. If this does not sound favorable we can set the rule to be like MM HB's with only one life and crew per game.

Alright guys, I'd just like to say that everyone here should give the full real battle game mode a go, you will crash, you will almost certainly need a joystick or 360 controller [(they are damn cheap - the Logitech Extreme 3d Pro is $22!!, I use it and it's great.)](http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Extreme-Joystick-Silver-Black/dp/B00009OY9U) and the game *is* hard, but that's something we don't see much of these days and I think that's something really great!

You see, with arcade you hop straight in and any scrub can pretty much fly straight away and get some kills, sure this is great when you're very new to the game and learning up from down. But aside from learning the absolute basics there's nothing else challenging out there in Arcade mode, just mouse over the enemy and hold down left click, reload, repeat.

Full Real Battle mode has a learning curve and I think that once you start to learn this game fully you get a sense of achievement, every kill is well earned, you fight to stay alive with much more ferocity than in Arcade mode. You play a much more tactical game.

**tl;dr: Before writing off FRB as too hard on your first go when you crash before take off give FRB a *real* go and [buy a joystick](http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Extreme-Joystick-Silver-Black/dp/B00009OY9U), it really improves the immersiveness  of the game.**

P.S. If FRB is too much of a jump from Arcade, at least work your way up by playing the Historical Battles.

**Edit: After looking into the mouse controls a little bit more, it might make it easier to fly with the mouse by setting  ""Mouse usage"" to the ""Relative control"" option (Note: this is not available in Mouse Look, you will have to set it in the other control schemes. This makes it fly a bit more like Battlefield 3 instead of simulating a joystick with your mouse which really sucks. I haven't tested this myself but you may want to give this a go.)**"	t5_2uc6j	True
1376440856.0	1kbf3p	TIP: Escaping enemy aircraft	Ferrariic	38	4	74	"They're many good pilots out there but the best pilots are able to escape enemies and trick them to leave you alone. Here are some tips for you guys planning to live through your next encounter. 

TIP 1: Out run or come to a stop. Simple, you've got a fast plane, use it to your advantage. Dive down close to the ground to max your speed quickly and stay low, various other planes won't be able to get you, be agile. If your plane is slower, use that. Reduce your speed or force a stall, don't raise your altitude but keep a steady turn, the aircraft behind you will pick up speed and pass you. You may now escape or chase. 

TIP 2: maneuvers. 
If you have a light aircraft hold down Q A and S, at the same time. You will stall and spin, to recover accelerate and you will easily fool anyone chasing you. Do not attempt to go higher, get closer to the ground as you can use the unpredictability and lack of safety to your advantage here. Other planes will try to follow but will have to follow carefully or risk crashing. For bombers, you are basically Sky Titans, all you need to do is not fly straight, you are slow as it is so don't pick up speed, other planes will easily chase and shoot you down. Staying straight also allows rockets to shoot you down easily. 

TIP 3: Feign death. 
Got a broken elevator or wing? Use to to your advantage, head to the ground and pretend your going to die, pull up a reasonable distance away and head towards your base for repairs. (Most planes will leave if there is heavy fighting and they have found they have done severe damage to you already) 

Good luck, this will save you. Trust me."	t5_2uc6j	True

1365023634.0	1bm4u4	USA Rant. Plz Ignore	Beefcake13	53	21	33	"I have been a USA player for about two months now and have experienced the highs and lows of the game and would just like to vent some of my rage towards how utterly terrible the state of the game is.

1. Planes

 a. The p-51 mustang turned the tide of the air war upon its production. This plane matched or bettered all of the Luftwaffe's aircraft. The p-51 performs like a wet dog shaking its coat out and is generally despicable. There aren't even any variants of this plane yet they give is 2 airacobras and 3 kingcobras that were almost all flown by the Russians?

 b. B-17. This plane (and almost all other bombers) simply pop to any gun larger than a 50cal. At one point today I asked a 109-g2 (2 km away) if I could drop my bombs before he raped me. Both wings, and my tail had jettisoned off my plane before I could finish typing the sentence.......

 c. BF109-G6 A great plane. I understand why every German pilot has this plane in their lineup and do not argue with the way it performs. I do however believe that this plane is not at the correct level as it out classes EVERY other plane at lvl 13. In addition it has the highest reward bonus of any fighter at lvl 13 in the game at 140% thus increasing its abuse.

2. General USA/Japan high level planes. Where are they? The US have three planes above lvl 14, 2 of which are bombers. The Japanese also have three planes above lvl 14 and are capped at 17. I would like to see more variants of high level planes on both sides as there are 7 BF 109 variants........................................

3. Me bitching. broken economy. loads of free exp. sales to gobble down any existing lions. expert training costs too much. CHARGING EAGLES FOR ACE TRAINING!? if the inflation on planes continues they will be charging first born babies and virgins soon. costs on training crew for high lvl aircraft is not worth it. 

I would like to see this game succeed and I love playing it game but things need to change. There are absolutely op nations that everyone should play. No nation should have that much of an advantage but instead each race should have a historically accurate slight edge that attracts players based on their style of play. All nations should have WELL ROUNDED air forces with similar lvl planes performing EQUALLY. I understand this is hard to balance with historical accuracy but this seems to me the only fair way to balance it. Finally, I understand that this game is in beta but none of the changes/updates I have seen have been attempts to balance/fix existing problems. Recently they have only added a few more planes and have changed perfectly fine mechanics of the game. They have seemed to enrage more people to the point of quitting/boring people to death with repetitive game play. Let me know what you think please. 

Thanks, Beef

1374753680.0	1j0ta4	Armament and what people seem to forget about it (Long Post)	ScrubWTPlayer	53	19	45	"***TL:DR*** Bulletproof glass thick enough to reliably stop 7.62 and 12.7mm fire was only in small areas to the front and back due to the huge weight of bulletproof glass, especially during WWII. Pilot gets hit by 7.62, probably dead/incapacitated, anything above are ALMOST guaranteed dead/incapacitated. In general, most if not all the weapons in the game are probably LESS effective in many cases than they really should be.

Also, I'm bad at formatting on reddit

***************************

I've noticed a lot of complaints about cannons being over powered, or pilots getting shot out a ton, etc. I'd like to go over some things that maybe some people don't consider when they are talking about how they think things should work.

First, let's talk about bullet proof glass:

Today, bulletproof glass must be 2.374in(6.03cm) thick to make the required rating for stopping 7.62 rounds. This results in a density of 26 pounds per square foot(127kg/m2)! [Wiki Link with references](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletproof_glass) Remember, this data is from ***2011*** . The bullet proof glass used in WWII was significantly heavier. As a result, they only used it just in front and behind the pilot, everything else was thinner, lighter, and weaker material. In addition, not all aircraft even used bulletproof glass at all, for example in the P47's case, it did not receive a bulletproof windshield until the P47-D16 variant: [P47 Wiki, info on bulletproof windshield in P47D section towards bottom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_47_Thunderbolt)

For the actual armament, let's start with the small arms stuff, 7.62 rounds:

Although there is different length cartridges, if you just want to get an idea about the kind of power a 7.62 round would have, you can imagine that your plane is firing AK-47s at the enemy aircraft. While these likely wouldn't do a lot of damage to an armored aircraft, if one of the crew got hit, they would likely go down, or at least would have a lot of trouble continuing to fly/shoot/whatever their job is. Given the information above on bulletproof glass, I'd say that being hit in the front or back of the canopy should have a fairly low chance of killing the pilot, but anywhere else, the bullet would have plenty of stopping power to incapacitate or kill them.

Next let's move on to .50 Caliber, (I'll just include 12.7mm-13mm in this even if they aren't exactly .50 caliber):

Compared to a .30-06, which can produce an energy of around 3-4 kilojoules, the .50 cal can produce an energy of around **14-18 kilojoules**. That's more than 4 times the energy whistling through the air. Also keep in mind that the .30-06 round is already larger than the previously mentioned 7.62 rounds. [.50 BMG power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.50_BMG#Power). Given the energy that a .50 cal round has over a 7.62 round, it it would have a higher chance of penetrating the front and back bullet proof glass, but how often it did so would probably depend on the thickness of the glass used. Again, hits other than the front/back that hit the pilot would be very likely to kill/incapacitate them. In addition, pretty much any fighter, even those with relatively high armor (*for a fighter*) should be able to be torn apart by these bad boys.

Last let's take a look at 20mm and above (grouping these to keep the post from being longer than it already is)

A simple 20mm round has roughly 50 kilojoules muzzle energy [20mm Cannon info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_mm_caliber), almost 4 times more than the .50 BMG. Given the above information, I'd say that 20mm cannons should do heavy damage to all but the most heavily armored air targets, and decent damage to ones that are heavily armored. Anything above that and you start to get ridiculous, 30mm and above should heavily damage anything you can get to stay in the air. Their effect on the pilot would depend on what type of round was used; while an AP round from a cannon would probably have good penetration on most bulletproof glass pieces, an HE 20mm round with little actual penetration hitting the BPG one time could possibly be survivable. Again on the flip side anywhere other than the areas protected by the BPG would almost surely result in a dead pilot. 

Here is an image of the effects of a Mk108 30mm cannon hit on a Blenheim to give a visual idea of the power: [30mm Mk108 Effect](http://en.valka.cz/files/mk-108_blenheim.jpg) 
[A video of the same cannon's effect on a spitfire's wing (from lptomtom)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoLLDi-M3fk)

Yes, in real life there are always going to be examples where people survived extraordinary situations, that's just the way life is. Things like that happen in War Thunder too! That's the way it should be in my opinion. There is obviously a difference between the way something ""should"" happen and what actually will happen. However, that doesn't mean that it would be common for these situations to happen, just because there are a few examples out there."	t5_2uc6j	True

- **When submitting game-mode-specific content (such as requests for help in flying in Arcade mode, tips for Historic Battles or a video from a Full Real Battle), start your title with the appropriate tag: [Arcade], [HB] or [FRB].**

This one is to make it easier to identify what game mode we're talking about in a thread, in the comments to a video, among the replies to tips and tricks, etc. There are significant differences in gameplay and airplane performance across the three game modes, so it helps greatly if you use a tag in your title!

If you have any thoughts on our current rules, please share them with us; I'd also like to hear if you want more rules.

Please do not use the **report** button if the comment you'd wish to report isn't spam, against reddit's rules (personal information, for example), or against our subreddit rules. Do not use the button as a super-downvote, it's annoying. You're all mature enough to come here and endure a little dirty language and disagreement.

___

Over the past month we've added three sites as resources for helping you start out in War Thunder and improve your tactics and knowledge.

1. **[The official War Thunder Wiki](http://warthunder.wikia.com/wiki/War_Thunder_Wiki)**

2. **[The Complete Beginner's Guide to War Thunder](http://www.kiasa.org/2013/02/12/the-complete-beginners-guide-to-war-thunder/)**

3. **[Dogfighting Instructional Videos](http://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/10709-dogfighting-instructional-videos/)** (fixed link)

If for any reason you don't feel one of these isn't worth its place there, do say so! And if you know of any other links to add, again, do say so.

___

**All of you are welcome to add the RDDT_ tag to your ingame handles!**

With no official inclusion of clans/squadrons yet, the RDDT tag serves the purpose to simply identify ourselves to fellow redditors. When that changes, we will ensure to open up discussion about who uses the RDDT tags and the goals and objectives of a RDDT squadron. In /r/WorldofTanks, RDDT is a premier clan wars-participating clan, and RDDT could certainly go for a leading role as a clan in War Thunder too (considering our numbers). 

Note, we have no relation to the WoT RDDT or any other game's RDDT groups.

Also, when you notice players with the numbers 508 in their names ragging on RDDT, don't worry about it... they're 4channers from /vg/. They like to hate on reddit.

___

Lastly, I'd like to add **we've made a second room for Arcade players in the RDDT Squadron room for our Teamspeak 3 channel** (the details are in the sidebar). It was pointed out to us that the one Arcade room was pretty crowded. You can thank /u/Muleo for sorting that out for us. (you may have noticed his name is purple on our subreddit, since he's on the Flight Models Dev team for War Thunder)

___
___

Well, that's that! Thanks again to you all, and from myself, a special thank you to /u/Commander_Adama for your great work as a main moderator and for styling the subreddit. Hopp Schwiiz! ;)

P.S. WHO'S PUMPED FOR TANKS AND WARSHIPS?

1376016342.0	1k02lc	My Analysis of US Prop Fighters / Discussion	tipsy3000	34	5	46	"Ok I finally hit the milestone of lv 13 for the US fighters, pretty much that includes all prop fighters bar the now new F8F Bearcat. After Trying out all the US prop fighters practically iv noticed they are all incredibly the same, not different just like the German line of fighters, especially as we go each patch in and Gaijin makes the US FM's more accurate. As you go up the US plane line youll start to notice what they begin to improve on plane wise

- Bigger payloads
- More range
- More diverse payloads/weapon load-outs
- Tougher aircraft

Really as you go further up the US becomes more and more of the king of multipurpose aircraft, however I am finding this to be their biggest flaw. As your aircraft get more range and payload options the planes themselves are not really getting that much faster, that much stronger, nor that much better at climbing. Literally here is the best example of this...

- F4F-3 - T5 fighter, poor speed, poor climbing, ok turning, ok firepower
- P47-D25 - T9 Fighter, ok speed, poor climbing, poor turning, good firepower
- P51-D5- T13 fighter, ok speed, kinda not so piss poor climbing?, ok turning, good firepower

Literally Iv flown each of these planes in succession and the only difference I ever saw was that the jump to the P47 gave me a faster plane with piss poor acceleration then the jump to the P51 gave me a fast plane with ok acceleration but all 3 still sucked at climbing. We are talking a 4 Tier gap between these planes and they all almost play exactly alike if it wasnt for the ever increasing range, bigger and more diverse payloads I probably couldn't tell the difference between the aircraft apart from the slightly different primary machine gun load outs.

Now your probably saying ""Hey Tipsy why didnt you mention the good aircraft you know the P63/F4U1D?!"" Im glad you asked. Since 1.33 both the F4U1D which is T8 and the P63-A10 (fastest of the 3) which is T9 got improved FM which are more accurate, which now they aren't supreme climbers and more inline with the other US aircraft

When you compare this to a similar increase in the UK line you see actual improvements from each aircraft as you go up in the line.

- SpitMK2 T6 - poor speed, ok climbing, good turning, ok firepower
- SpitMK5 T8 - good speed, ok climbing, good turning, ok firepower
- SpitfMK9 T10 - great speed, great climbing, good turning, good firepower (more munitions)
- SpitMK16 T11 Great speed, Great climbing, good turning, good firepower

The line is shorter between aircraft, but the improvements are much more noticeable.

The game right now, in HB/FRB, has no place for US aircraft advantages. With the game currently focused on point interception from rapidly taking off from airfields to kill all enemy planes for the victory, the US has no hope. Their extended range is useless on all maps because the battle ends in a single sortie under 30 minutes. Their expansive and heavy payloads again are pointless where victory is claimed by plane kills not ground attack. Really right now its all about climb speed and air to air firepower, whoever can hit 6k meters first and fastest has a massive chance of winning. This is something the US does not specialize in, this is why they tend to get badly stomped unless they take massive amounts of time to climb, and work together and work efficiently. Even then as the game stands now it negates really one of the cool advantages of the US fighters with its really diverse load-out options, which if you equip any in the current game youll get called a noob or a dummy for loading bombs/rockets.

There is one other advantage the US line should have but isnt shown in game, and that was the fact of the US industry churning out thousands of planes by the day. It would be cool if you could respawn by using your teams tickets if you died, thus the US planes could have really low respawn ticket costs while other factions have higher/moderate ones to represent the massive US industry. The German vs US maps would now be a test of Germans fighting not just 16 vs 16 planes but potentially 60 or even 80 planes in waves while they get half or even a 3rd of that in terms of respawning tickets.

Anywho I wanted to throw this out there, quite shamed the US line has cool advantages but cant use any of them in the current game to an effective extent.

This is your co-pilot Wolf_ofthe_North (no GoT reference intended) and I will be flying with you today to teach you the essentials of bombing the enemy base and surviving in arcade mode with a fully loaded B-17. That means that you have slaved away at adding a new engine, air resistance, and the pylons necessary to wield the base-busting 8 1000lb bombs. 

Now first, we have to wait for a suitable ground strike map, as the B-17 is not very useful in a domination scenario. Once we've started out on the map, it's important to figure out the approximate distance to target. Maps such as Berlin suburbs are very long, and it takes more time to reach the base, whereas in maps such as Africa Canyon or Rice Terraces, you are on the enemy base as nearly as the game starts. 

The second thing we do when the round starts is to get lighter. We do this by dropping our payload, which gets us 8000lbs lighter. Be careful not to bomb your own targets though. Keep committing warcrimes by dropping your payload onto happless houses and farmlands alike while we make our way towards the airfield. 

Now that we're light, we're ready to get high. You're gonna want to hold down WEP, or the SHIFT key, which will bring the B-17 to 118% power. I like to climb at a 30 degree angle when wepping. In AB, wepping lasts about 30 secs and there is no penalty for continually using it. It cannot be overstated that climbing in the B-17 is your life blood, which brings us to the next point. 

In a fighter, to survive an attack, you jink. You would press 'A' or 'D' to roll and bank left and right. In the B-17, in order to surive, you press 'S'. Do not turn. Do not dive. Only by climbing while WEPping can you hope to survive. If an enemy comes upon you, you want to get them onto your tail. This is where you will record most of your kills, especially if they assualt you while climbing to you, that is, while you are above them. This robs them of energy making them easier targets to hit. 

Ok, by now, we're practically over the base. Make sure to observe your surroundings for immediate threats before going into bomber-view. Once in bomber-view, make sure you use the zoom option, which is defaulted to 'Z'. In order to stabilize your sights when dropping bombs, you may want to use combat flaps and cut power to 50% or so. You don't need to do this if you've lined up the airfield for a parralel run, but it is useful on your initial approach, when the airfield can be perpendicular to your approach vector. 

Once you've dropped your initial 8 bombs across their landing strip, peel off to the side that is closest to the end of the runway. You want to line up the runway so that you are flying directly away from it. In a B-17 with fully upgraded reload time, it takes about :55 to reload. You will need to fly away from the runway for about 1:05 so the reload time in an approximate indicator.

Right then, now for the hardest part of bombing an airfield. Cut your power to 40%, bank turn left or right, switch to bomb view and see that your crosshairs are angling at a substantial--but steady rate--off center. 

The key to a good, crisp turn--one that leaves you directly over target and parallel to it--is steadiness in the turn. This simply takes practice to master. If you find that you have banked too shallow, add some power. If you find that you have banked too steeply, turn slightly against the bank and add some more power. DO NOT drop your bombs if you are wobbling out of control. Only when you are smooth is it worth dropping. Then again--if you run out of runway target, drop the entire load. Better to wait for them to reload and climb than to hold onto useless deadweight. 

Once you whip out of your turn, drop your bombs in a rhymic fashion, it helps with the aiming. Once you are done dropping, pull hard up and towards the direction you had been previously turning. Keep climbing and turning until you are again going directly away from the runway. After dropping your bombs, DO NOT CONTINUE TO FLY PAST THE RUNWAY. This will make your setup time faster by 1.5. The fastest way to drop bombs and reload is to fly in a circle. 

I find that on solo missions, it takes about 5 passes in a B-17 to get the job done. It will seem like 4 will be enough, but it comes up short everytime. If you get shot-down after your fourth pass, it will take about 4000lbs more to finish the job. Do not demand an escort. You are not entitled to one. If you are bombing with a friend in a B-17, do not stay in formation when you are over the target. Rather, split in separate directions so that you are harder to kill. 


Finally, when dropping your last payload, don't say ""Game Over"" unless it's really game over, it makes you look like an ass if you're premature. "	t5_2uc6j	True

Second: Stop tunnel-vision, if you werent that hung up on going ALL-in on the burner infront of you, maybe you would avoid colliding with other players. Safety first, kill second.

KazumaKat	37	3	25	"I've just ended what is to be a 4-day long Japanese-only stint which quickly became a test of endurance, and then a true test of the soul by the end trying to get beyond the tier 7 Zero.

what I've found after returning to normally sceduled War Thunder is that the Japanese are obviously over-tiered and underperforming. This is evident when I checked my records wherein I actually **lost money** playing the Japanese because of all the mishaps and failures I've gained, let alone the many friendly-fire kills I scored in the Zero :|

The things I've found:

* T7 Zero rolls slower than a bomber at its arcade speeds. This is historically accurate and there are techniques designed to nullify this to an extent, chief among which is to not fight at said arcade speeds. The problem here is that turn-fighting, the sole advantage of the Zero, is a bygone era by its tier, due to the strong performing Germans, Americans, and obviously the Russians with their far superior energy fighters.

* KI-61 Ia and Ib at tiers 5 and 6 perform adequately against tiered combatants, but quickly melt against anything higher, like a 109F-4. This is because whilst they can energy fight when pressed, they cannot maintain that performance as long as a true energy fighter.

* Default Japanese ammunition loadouts are horrificly inadequate against the targets they are shooting at. This combined with the KI-61's tendency to rudder-waver at its combat speeds and the horrificly bad roll characteristics of the Zero means that if you do score a hit, the likelyhood is that you need a long 4-5 second burst to score a good kill, unlike the squirts you only need to do in a comparable USA, German, British, and Russian plane.

* It is historically accurate that Japanese planes are known to be flamers, aka, **way** too easy to set aflame and/or kill. This is accurate. However, with the ranking the Zero has, its already fighting aircraft that historically speaking already were an era ahead and were designed to take down the Zero. Case in point. The F6F Hellcat, colloquially known as the Zero Killer, is a T6 USA. The first Zero, the A6M2, is a T7. Do the math.

What I'm seeing so far is that the Zero line at least needs to be tiered down, to bring it forward to its more historically accurate comparators. This would also solve its already lackluster performance in Arcade where a Zero is seen as an easy kill, let alone the Hien series and the predating aircraft. It does not help that Gaijin obviously have it against the Japanese line economically because of me losing money (about 15K worth in repair cost alone for 4 days) just playing the side.

The Zero needs to be tiered down, and immediately. Or its performance improved so that it can combat people at its tier."	t5_2uc6j	True

When the long awaited 1.29 update came out it was a sudden change to the flowing game play of 1.27 although in quite a few respects the game improved after a few micro patches and i thought great they are improving on an already great game.

Lately however with the release of 1.31 all I can see gaijin doing with the game is plowing it into the ground as hard and as fast as they can in order to make as much money in a short time as possible. The new economy model makes it virtually pointless to go anywhere past tier 9 without waiting days of real time for aircraft to repair. Now my games consist of me trying desperately not to die so I don't have to pay what are stupidly high repair costs for planes i worked hard to purchase and now cant even use.

I usually only fly HB now anyways since trying to do the objectives on arcade doesn't seem to matter anymore and 99% of the games im getting have 4+ ai on either side so the 5-6 real players who are actually in game rush straight to the enemy ai to get easy kills and the match becomes a low level furball that ends in under 10 minutes. 

The new 1.31 patch I haven't seen a single thing that improves the game play it only makes it harder to earn lions and it wasn't that easy before 1.31, sure they decreased plane prices by a small amount but they upped repair costs across the board and made it impossible to play more than a handful of high level games a day. 

All of the people I knew that i brought to play the game have long since gone and i doubt I will stay much longer if they keep making the game unplayable for those people who don't have large amounts of spare cash to throw at the game.

I know this game is still in ''Beta'' but I haven't seen it even go slightly in the right direction since 1.27 its heading away from what a game should be, if they want to maximize their profits which they obviously do they should refine the game play not spend all their time making the economy virtually unplayable to anyone not flying a premium aircraft on a premium account. I would just like to come on war thunder have a fun game on a balanced map with balanced aircraft and matchmaker and be justly rewarded for my efforts is that so much to ask???

* Looking at how to solve technical and secrecy-issues with user-submitted models

* Rocket planes may get lowered tier. If not; likely to get lowered repairs in HB/FRB

* FM team will strive to provide a bit more detailed notes for the patch logs

* More customizability to airplane loadout will come, for example gun pods

* No separate game mode for heavy bomber missions. However more types of targets, including area targets like factory complexes

* Rewards like kill streaks and bomber/fighter rescue will start giving lions instead of XP

* Economy will be tweaked further soon, when impact of bug-fixed kill and assist detection has been measured

* Forced bail-out timer in Arcade only occurs for engine being dead, for fires inside the plane, and when wings are shot off. Not yet decided if to remove it for dead engine.

* Force-tilting/flipping planes with wingtip should be tested. Functionality of feature unsure.

* Achievements and other things that have to do with player level will be added. Please contribute with suggestions for things players can strive for, and be rewarded with.

* Planes with larger crews (bombers) may get ability to replace unconcious pilot. Will be tested in Army (tanks) mode before possible future implementation.

* Selling planes will require the economy to change to REQUIRE you to sell planes to progress fast (like in World of Tanks). Such a change is not a goal of Gaijin. They want people to keep all planes, and play all planes.

* Other payment options limited because it could mean different prices for the same amount of eagles. European customers not used to that.

* Adding new game modes won't happen until there is a playerbase the size that supports it

* HB will not be split depending on control mode (mouse or joystick)

* The LumberYak video probably a result of what items are collided with, and if flying or rolling.

* Pilot-controlled guns on bombers will (likely) get ammo belt variations. Might happen for turret gunners, but not decided, and not anytime soon.

* Internal review on likelyhood/presence of bad weather, that you wouldn't normally fly in

* Reason for reduced XP gain on maxed plane is that the crew is so good [at that plane] that they cannot really learn more from flying it.

* Community Translation Project upcoming, letting the community do translations of in-game text, so that the texts are in a level of language that players understand and appreciate.

* Britain will get new high-tier single-engine planes in the near future (Spitfire Mk.XXI?)

* Cargo planes will not be added until the current release tech trees have been completed

* 'Reconnect to battle'-function is planned

* Potential addition of ""Punish? Yes/No"" system for teamkilling

1375676614.0	1jpz5l	What's Wrong With Arcade?	Desdichado	39	12	74	"[A simple example](http://i.imgur.com/3rm53wV.jpg)

After more than 300 hours of playtime in Arcade, I have some thoughts on the matter:

1)  The first is a gross imbalance between the effectiveness of killing ground targets vs killing planes in terms of their effects on winning the match.  Killing other players has virtually no influence on winning the match in arcade.  This is because the matches are so short, it's rare for a critical mass of players to ever run out of aircraft.  Hence, for all intents and purposes they can respawn continually until the match is over.  By contrast, killing ground targets directly contributes to victory through reduction of the enemy's 'tickets'.

2)  You cannot defend ground targets in arcade.  Sure one may get the lucky pilot snipe, but it is not consistently possible to defend ground targets.  Planes start at altitude and can simply dive toward their target.  Even bombers can generate enough speed in a dive in arcade to make it impossible for fighters to intercept if they fail to snipe them during a ~2 second window on their way down.  Effective defense is impossible because there is not enough distance between the spawn points and the ground targets to overcome this advantage.

3)  Domination rewards players who are willing to recklessly attempt a landing on an enemy-held airfield.  What conceivable analogue does this gameplay mechanic have to historical fighter combat?  Rhetorical question, of course.  Landing on the enemy airfield is not really a function of skill, but almost entirely luck.  Gambling on luck is something good players, by definition, do not do.

Therefore, the key to winning in arcade is to ignore air-to-air combat altogether and focus solely on ground targets (ground strike + domination) or landing on airfields (domination).  Focusing on planes, quite literally, makes you a liability to your team since you're not a) killing ground targets or b) landing on airfields, which are the two ways to win an arcade match.  Personally, I do not find this desirable.  If I wanted to play a PvE game, I wouldn't need to be online to do it.  I do wonder, however, what the point is of building an air combat simulator that marginalizes air-to-air combat in the most used game mode.

My proposal:  Allowing air kills to reduce the opponent's tickets.   I believe this would go a long way toward balancing the two playstyles in arcade."	t5_2uc6j	True

1369058240.0	1eoz4p	[News] Interview with Pavel Kulikov, War Thunder's Executive Producer	darkflare42	31	4	55	"Here is a [link](http://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/35825-interview-with-pavel-kulikov-war-thunders-executive-producer/) to the post on the official Warthunder forums. Transcript is below:



&gt;Recently during KRI show (Conference of Russian Game developers) Pavel Kulikov, Gaijin Entertainment, Executive Producer of War Thunder gave an interview to the Russian gaming portal GoHa.ru covering the most top rated questions of the player community.
  
* **Q: Ground Forces: release date and gameplay**

 * **A:** Ground Units will come this year. Recently we’ve published a Teaser, which means that soon we are going to provide more information for the upcoming Ground Forces. As for the frequently asked question,  how all this is going to look , surely we will  make combats for both airplanes and ground units controlled by the players on the same map, but still we will provide the opportunities for our players to take part in airplane-only or ground-force-only games. The tab “army” will be available then, with its own tech trees and so on. Yet I cannot tell anything about certain ground unit classes, there is a huge amount of gameplay, that we are still testing.  Classic tanks will surely be introduced, but concerning the other types of ground units I can not tell now – it is all being tested for now. And we are working hard on the Fleet issue, but for now the priority is Ground Forces. We are making models and tech trees for the ships, and we had showed the screenshots of the ships already, but for now we are mostly focused on the ground forces. Ships are going to come later, that I can tell
 
* **Q: What should the players expect from the nearest patches?**
 * **A:** First of all the new patch will introduce the clan system. There will be leaderboards. so the players will have the opportunity to find out the one who is not only the best player, but the best squadron as well. And we are going to support this kind of player activity: making tournaments, events and so on. This is all going to come within a next major patch.
 
  * We are also going to update the debrief window interface, improve decal options etc.  The new patch will also provide new aircraft and locations. We have just announced first screenshots for the Soviet MiG-3, a high-altitude interceptor fighter. More to come.
 
* **Q: Night fights and missions.**

   * **A:** We have already night fights, battles in bad weather. We will probably separate them into the specific option to choose, but this is not our top priority task now. Also, we're thinking about adding radars, but we have to test them well before adding into the gameplay.


* **Q: 'Schräge Musik' – will it be introduced and, if it will, when?**

 * **A:** The idea of angled weapons is interesting, we have already aircraft models which had this type of weaponry, for example Do.217. One of the upcoming updates will bring the Do.217 with “Schräge Musik” system.
 
* **Q: When will the controls be finalized?**

 * **A:** Optimization of game controls is a very fluid process. Our patent-pending mouse aim system was extremely good from the very beginning, now we have to adjust it to the perfection. As for joysticks and devices – the work is in progress now, some enhancements were introduced already, much more are to come. One of the upcoming updates will bring response curves available from the interface, for example. Our guideline here is our players' feedback – we're trying to make our controls comfortable for all War Thunder pilots.
 
* **Q: Bomber cockpits**

 * **A:** Bombers’ cockpits gonna be added as soon as they are ready, not all at once, for now we have a couple of cockpits being ready, one of them “Peshka” has already been shown. And one more thing – you have nothing to worry about, we are not going to copy the same cockpit for different modifications of one plane, they gonna be original for every craft.
 
* **Q: New nations.**

 * **A:** Concerning new nations to be introduced – next ones will be the Italians. They already have some biplanes, a good fighter – M.C.202, bombers. But still lack top-level aircrafts, as soon as we introduce top planes (they're being developped now), the Italians will become a separate Nation to play. France will be introduced after Italy.
 
**Summary:**

So this year we will introduce ground units, cross-platform for PC and PS4 gaming, also MacOS, Android and iOS versions are in development, this year is very promising and we have surprises for you yet to be announced."	t5_2uc6j	True

I've put over 100 hours in this game and i really wish i could play again, its a lot of fun. Once again, no password or email changes have been emailed to me. Halp! Thanks.	t5_2uc6j	True

* The dev's have given us admin privileges in the reddit channels on the TS, allowing us to wear Alien logos and control the creation of extra rooms and stuff. I highly encourage you to log on and get to know the other members of the community!

****
* RDDT is full, join RDDT1 if your application has not been accepted. RDDT2 will be open within a day or two because RDDT1 will be full very soon. 


****
* [**HERE's**](http://i.imgur.com/BVOHKD6.png) the layout of the wing. Right now we're just focusing on getting our members signed up with tags. In the future, RDDT will be the competitive squadron, RDDT1 will be an intermediate/training squadron, and RDDT2 will be a social squadron. **THIS IS NOT HAPPENING YET**, we'll post more info on this in the future.

****
* **Mcbarry, Semper_fi_guy, Puttles, and Snafu_52** have volunteered and been selected as Squadron Commanders. They will work jointly to lead their squadrons and pass out information to you, as well as gather your feedback and incorporate it into what we're doing. If you see them in TS drop them a line!

* **EchoAlpha** has volunteered and been selected as our Diplomat. He's going to connect us to other Squadrons for challenges and tournaments, which have already begun! See the bottom of this post.

* We still have several positions open for volunteers. Please post if you have an interest in filling one of them.
 1. **Squadron Commander (2)-** Helps with decision making, deals with inner-squadron drama and personnel issues and communicates with members. This is a time-intensive job.
 1. **Training Officer-** Oversees the training of members in the intermediate squadron. Needs to be a good/very good pilot, but will also be responsible for managing other trainers. 
 1. **PR Officer-** Moderates the wing subreddit, handles the flow of information within the wing about everything. Must piss rainbows and give unicorns to everyone to keep us happy.
 1. **Events Officer-** Plans and schedules all events for the wing including custom games, training, tournaments, competitions, etc. Manages the wing calendar and deconflicts issues as they arise. 

****
* We have our first Clan challenge from 10K, if you are interested in competing please post here.

****
 * Lastly, we reserved a new subreddit for the wing. PM me to gain access to it. 

This was done to prevent cluttering the Warthunder sub and to ensure that announcements remain visible for all members to see.

Thanks guys, leave your questions, comments, or feedback here.

(i dont know where its going though i dont have any kind of clearance beyond what you all do)

 People really need to SHUT.THE.FUCK.UP about the flight models. I have sat in on the team speak of the FM development group for a day and the things they are doing is for all intensive purposes rocket science (or aeronautical engineering if you prefer) .Flight models are not some list of data points you fill out. You dont type into the code ""hurr have a turn time of 25 seconds"" ""hurr turn down the climb rate"".  You have to physically model the plane in a mathmatic environment (not a graphical environment) to have the proper wing loading , dihedral , and a myriad of other variables I cant list because i have no idea what they even mean. This shit takes endless amounts of trial and error. Then you have situations where some new changes will undo the changes made previously.  Its extremely complicated and time consuming to make a working flight model. So please stop getting irrationally cranky about it. 

The russians are not and I quote ""purposely buffing their planes cuz they are russian"". Thats asinine horse shit that only an edgy teenager could think up. The LA series was simply one of the planes this patch that had an error in it that was either undetected or detected too late in development to delay the patch. 

Like I said  , I was here when this game had like 2 maps and possibly a quarter of the planes. What gaijin entertainment is doing with this game is some of the most impressive shit I have personally seen from a developer.  The amount of content they are putting out on a monthly basis , is nothing short of mindblowing. AND THIS IS ONLY THE CONTENT WE KNOW ABOUT THAT THE DEVS HAVE TOLD US ABOUT.   

This is a beta , you literally have NO right to complain AT ALL about the game being in development.  There will be bugs , there will be errors , there will be glitches , and there will be errors in the flight models.  

I dont care If you ""spent your hard earned money blah blah blah im entitled""  

The reason they make you pay for beta access isnt so they can sell you the game early , its to make sure that the people who are REALLY wanting to test and help out are also willing to make a donation to the development fund of this game. 

So please for the love of christ give it a break with the crying. I can promise you without a doubt , they know when something is wrong and are fixing it before you even realize something is wrong. "	t5_2uc6j	True

We've figured that organized events should be held on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights. Times to be determined if at all. Thats beyond the point though, I'm here to ask for Custom Game ideas. We've already hammered out two rather fun game types.

1) B17 vs Biplanes - Pretty straight forward. One B-17 vs an entire team of Reserve Biplanes. [Here] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0mITxPoKyM)

2) Dodge Plane - An idea I came up with in which one biplane must avoid being rammed by a team full of the fastest planes a player has available. The catch, no shooting and no throttling back (for the fast planes). The rammers must have their engines going balls to the wall fast. The Biplane can do anything in its power to avoid being rammed.

So now I ask you, good folks of /r/WarThunder. What are your ideas? What would you like to see done during game night? 

Edit: In regards to the time in which we would try to hold these events, it has been left undetermined. Usually weekend nights. We have no formal system yet and this is only very loosely based. So far, events happen when we get enough people in the Team Speak. If you want to join us, your best bet as of now is to be active in the TS. Perhaps we can make a steam group or get a dedicated forum. Ideas as to organization or welcome."	t5_2uc6j	True

I have never used a headtracker because I have really good spatial awareness. That and they cost money and require some custom led hat and everything. I found TrackNoIR and it's freaking awesome. Just a webcam and it tracks your face. It takes a little setup to adjust the curves to your sensitivity that you want. Now I fly arcade mode in cockpit view and get twice as may kills. It allows me to see around the cockpit and keep my combat awareness. Also, when I lean forward to see the screen closer, it zooms in.

I realize that there are better programs out there. Yet for a free webcam only face tracker that works this well I'm surprised. If you haven't used a head tracker before I would highly suggest trying this one out and see how you like it. It takes flying to a whole new level.

(I neglected to specify which mode (Arcade, HB, FRB) Because it is the same for each battle. The rewards are scaled for each. While yes you can make a load more with HB than in Arcade the repair cost is tripled. 60,000 lions to repair if shot down in HB.)

[Setting The Scene]

Imagine you are a pilot who likes to fly mainly US planes, you've worked at leveling up this faction for weeks prior to the update and finally make it to the fabled level 13 planes (P-51 B-17 yada yada) Now here comes the last few updates which have changed the damage model and economy several times. The B-17 can no longer fend for itself effectively and is feels like its made of paper. The P-51 Mustang, while fast and handles well, lacks the fire power to bring down the multitude of similarly leveled Russian and German planes. Now that the scene is set, lets begin our story.

You've entered matchmaking with a total faction level of 13 and after several minutes (Usually 3-4 minutes) you finally get placed into a match. You get lucky and end up with a good ground strike map with some good bombing weather and no clouds, so you figure you can get some high altitude bombing done.  You take your B-17 and begin the long slow climb to 11k. After all this its been about 5 minutes into the match and you're finally ready to start some real bombing, things look good and you begin to line up with a tank line. You're approaching your target of juicy medium tanks when suddenly a lone Fw 190 shoots up strikingly fast and matches your altitude in a mater of seconds. You frantically take your gunners and begin pouring lead into the bastard, scoring a multitude of hits on his wings and engines. Though what should appear to be an easy victory on your part slowly becomes a horrifying realization, the enemy fighter won't go down. He continues to line up his guns and releases a few short burst from his guns, and to your own horror your B-17 decides that it doesn't like flying much anymore and splits in two. You crash before you could even get your payload on target and end up 20,000 Lions poorer than before (assuming you are gong to repair the plane). Now repeat this process every time you want to play your expensive B-17 and thats what its like now. A waste of time and effort. The only way you could possibly hope to support planes like this is through Premium and copious purchasing of Gold Eagles.

In all seriousness I really love this game, I've thrown money at it (Pre-Update) and have supported it for months. I've spent hours making videos of the game and posting them on Youtube. I've gone about telling anyone I know about Warthunder but here I am today finding it harder and harder to play the game and find it enjoyable. The game shouldn't feel like a choir or a job. It should be fun as it is with out the impossible grind and economic system built to try and force people to turn to Gold Eagles or Premium. I spent money on this game voluntarily before the update because it was fun, the economy was generous but still supported a fair grind. I only hope that this story reaches people who care because this is not the Warthunder I first got addicted to.

Am I the only one who sees it as laughably obvious that the flight models for the Brewster Buffalo and the Republic P-47 are simply switched?

The purchased German P-47 was my first Fly-It-Dozens-of-Times plane, and I got pretty used to how it handles.  Hint: it's not great.

I clawed my way up to the US P-47, and the story is not surprisingly the same.

But behold, the Buffalo!  It climbs **faster than a G2 ME109**.  Well, that is simply not right.  It achieves 500 KPH in level flight, in about 20 seconds of normal acceleration.

Now, you'd think this might be an advantage, using a Level 2 Buffalo--which can keep pace with the Bought-A-Dora charity cases--against the other nation's level 0-2 aircraft like the sad-sack G.50, He-112, Hyabusa, etc.

But don't worry, the matchmaker is fucked.  You'll be facing those Baby's-First-Purchased-Plane D-13s and K4 109s anyway.

But on the plus side, you can outturn them and climb comparably.

Which should obviously be how the P-47 performs, not the Brewster.

**STRATEGIC EDIT:**
I definitely derailed my point before it even began with two cheap shots against the premium FW 190 D-13.  I will be the first to admit this isn't fair to pilots who earned their way up to the required rank.  

Worse, I'm a hypocrite because, as I mention above, one of my first go-to planes that I flew to get comfortable was the German P-47, a premium plane!  Admittedly the plane is basically a disadvantage but the reverse could easily have been true.

What I'm really mad at is not D-13 pilots, since they had to get to the required rank and could have been flying a D-12 instead.  I'm mad at the match-maker, which seems to put high ranking Germans above any other nation (and US the above Japan).  Can I please just wait an extra minute (i'm alt-tabbed to Reddit anyway waiting to hear the ""click"") and NOT fly my Buffalo against the D13?  I'll wait another 120 seconds for the He112/G.50/FC.202/He-51/HE-111/Ju-87 match-up, please.

Questions about future development will not be answered!

&gt;  Q: 2x daily bonus does not seem to give anything?

A: Will be checked with developers.

&gt;  Q: Why plane of same tiers does not have same cost and repair cost?

A: Variant, efficiency, engine rating, weapon rating are all factors to take. It is very hard to place planes to tier to exactly match each other. Sptfire MkI and Bf-109E-3 are good match because they fought each other, but E-3 had an edge on Spitfire.

&gt;  Q: Did Bf-109s were altered in last 1.29 patch?

A: Small tweaks in FM were done, but in general all FM in all game modes are the same. Game engine itself makes flying more easy in arcade.

&gt;  Q: How about adding more realism to arcade vs making arcade fun?

A: Arcade is supposed to be fun and it is probably going to stay like that but there is no definitive answer to that.

&gt;  Q: On HB mayor problem is you are stuck with one faction. Friend went other way, other factions and play so we have problem to play HB together.

A: When WW mode comes out everything is going to change.It is very hard to explain to all players that we are playing only 20% of the game at the moment.

&gt;  Q: Some different map in HB were on and it was great to break monotony but now they are not?

A: Some maps have bugs and developers are working on them. As soon as they are fixed, they will be back in game.

&gt; Q: What was the reason behind backup planes?

A: A lot of people were pushing to have two of same aircraft and to be able to be used in same battle. And option to do it was added.

&gt;  Q: Do you think HB now have too much downtime during battle (takeoff, landing, flying forward and back)?

A: That is the way how it is done, you have to pick up altitude, check battlefield etc. Best fighter pilot Erich Hartman said ""If you don't have advantage don't engage"". So, downtime is part of game and was much more in real life.

&gt;  Q: What happened with economy and why is economy like this now?

A: Basically, we don't want people to join the game and get to level 20 in a week. Before, that was possible, people come to game, bomb targets, leave the game or kamikaze not being punished at all. Now economy is set to eradicate that. Also, every economy change need to run for at least a week for data gathering before any decision is made. So, don't worry about economy too much, it will be changed for sure again and again.

&gt;  Q: Do you guys have any plans about wipeout after beta?

A: No, absolutely not, no wipe is planned.

&gt;  Q: Would it be possible to get notice prior to patch itself?

A: It is not possible. Notes will be more informative, i hope.

&gt;  Q: Premium user in todays economy cannot afford planes because XP is much more that lions. Why premium user does not get more money and less experience? XP gain outlevel lions by far.

A: Will be passed to devs and balance checked.

&gt; Q: Do you have plans to make harder arcade mode (with more realistic flight models), 4th mode?

A: Nothing is planned at this moment. Developers feel there is no need for now to introduce new game mode.

&gt; Q: Bomb load of some bombers in the game is lower than what bombers could take in real life?

A: That was done intentionally because of balance and necessity to stop bombers from killing all ground units in one pass.

&gt; Q: Yer-2 and why it carries more bombs then any other bomber in game?

A: Have to be checked with developers, not sure.

&gt; Q: Do you have plan to add more area targets for tactical and strategic bombers?

A: There are some great ideas about that and dev team is investigating new types of targets for strategic and tactical bombing.

&gt; Q: Any plans to introduce assets from the single missions and campaigns into arcade mode, maps etc etc.

A: New maps are in development and are coming when they are ready (have been tested).

&gt; Q: Tu2 is in the bomber line, why, it's more of an attacker kind of aircraft.

A: Their line will be revisited soon, new roads will also be available.

&gt; Q: We had a new damage system in hb, but it seems like its been rolled back to 1.27, why?

A: There was some bugs in it and it will be back in the next patch.

&gt; Q: Can we expect more in depth info about the planes?

A: They will be updated shortly.

&gt; Q: Why is AAA's super accurate? how can they track you from +10km ?

A: When it becomes player controlled your going to see a whole different ball game.

&gt; Q: Why do we earn about 1/5 xp when the planes experience bar is full? any changes?

A: Its all about game balance, things change every patch.

&gt; Q: Why is domination mode so rare?

A: Post it on the forum and it will be taken to the developers.

&gt; Q: There is different kinds of bombs where can i find more info about the diffrent kind of bombs?

A: It will be put on the forum tomorrow (03-23)

&gt; Q: Why cant we adjust the gun convergence in arcade?

A: Fill a bug report on the forum.

&gt; Q: Will you give us the option to add/delete guns?

A: No, simply for the balance.

&gt; Q: Rockets for German planes?

A: It will come eventually, its all about balance.

&gt; Q: Are gunners going to be a bit more effective?

A: Try and switch to the gunners yourself, no AI will ever be as good as you.

&gt; Q: Why cant we see what ammo is in the 'default' ammo type?

A: Its a bug and will be fixed soon, hopefully the next patch.

&gt; Q: Is the ammo velocity reflected?

A: Yes.

&gt; Q: Are there going to be any changes to the instructor?

A: Yes, mouse aim will be tweaked.

&gt; Q: Will the economy be changed?

A: Yes.

&gt; Q: Do you have statistics about how long it takes for a player to go from 0-12 and what planes should a level 12 player have?

A: We do have statistics but we can't really tell you.

&gt; Q: Why is there a huge gaps in the current Russian tech tree.

A: More planes will be added, but making their DM and FM takes time.

&gt; Q: Will the levels be 'historic' etc planes who fought each other is the same level?

A: Yes, when all the planes have been released.

&gt; Q: Why is there icons telling me who is friendly and the enemy?

A: We had a patch where there was no icons and it brought the whole fighting to the ground, which we dont want.

&gt; Q: Is there any plans on giving bombers some bonus? etc pilot die, co pilot take over, as long as you behave as a heavy bomber you get a wingman.

A: This will be taken to the developers.

&gt; Q: Is there any plans to introduce a 4th game mode?

A: Thera are no current plans of introducing a 4th game mode.

&gt; Q: Is there a plan to create a 4th mode, so that there may be a historical mode that fits for arcade players and a historical mode that fits for simulation players? (This is in relation to the bad visibility in FRB. Lemsko explained the issue deeply)

A: There are currently no plans to create an additional game, however we are reviewing player activity and listening to experienced pilots in order to determine possible changes to FRB. We are listening to the community and considering their ideas and suggestions to help remedy this issue.

&gt; Q: Are there any plans to support Linux?

A: Yes, of course. (This question is already answered in the Q&amp;A)

&gt; Q: Fuel count doesn't go down in Arcade. Is there actual fuel in Arcade battles?

A: There is fuel. However, the indicator doesn't go down because in arcade battles fuel isn't consumed unless there is a fuel leak. A decision was made to remove the fuel indicator in arcade battles because it's not important to arcade players.

&gt; Q: Clan functionality: We have a lot of buddies with the RDDT tag and many more who could benefit from a separate clan channel. What's going on with the clans feature? (He also asked about clan registration and such to prevent copies with clan tags)?

A: The clan feature is upcoming and I believe it will be implemented in the next upcoming major patch. Until then, you can register your clan on our forums on a first come first served basis. We have a ""Squadron Ready Room"" Section on the forums where you can do just that.

&gt; Q: After the latest patch, one my P-63 KingCobras (Yellow one) lost all of its skins. It shows Silver in my hangar but yellow in-game. Has something changed?

A: This was not intended. Submit a bug report with a screenshot attached on the newly created bug reporting section on the forums and it will be investigated.

&gt; Q: When an enemy goes above or below you while flying a bomber, it's hard to see the crosshair and the guy you want to shoot at. Are you planning to fix this, or perhaps introduce the first person view for gunners before that?

A: All gunners should be a separate entity, so for example you would be pressing Shift + 1/2/3/4 to switch between them and fire from a first person view. This question was asked before but never got followed on. Perhaps a suggestion in the forums can be made to continue this discussion.

&gt; Q: When the game goes live will we lose any of the aircrafts we have?

A: No... Not at all. There will be no wipe, but if a serious crash or anything that will force us to wipe out everything you spent in real money will be given back to you.

&gt; Q: I've been getting a lot of connection issues lately even though I know my connection is okay on my end?

A: Please submit a bug report on the new bugs section if you are repeatedly getting bad ping and even dropouts in the game. Just make sure to comply with that section's guidelines. Another thing you can do is to untick the ""Seed After Download"" button as you will be seeding the game for other people to download while you're playing.

1369971452.0	1fdtb1	1.31 Repair Costs? Did we miss something here?	bejeavis	29	4	45	"Patch notes relevant to this discussion:

&gt;The cost of repair for aircraft increased

&gt;Changed calculation of damages of the plane after the fight. Now it calculates more parameters.

We have seen images and videos showcasing the repair cost changes and immediately dismissed the increased repair cost patch note as a type or translation error, and everything looks GREAT, right?  HOWEVER, as a few have noticed, the tooltip has been changed from **Max Repair Cost** to **Average Repair Cost**.  Whoa, what?  I would like to know if the new tooltip is an error, or if the max repair cost is going to be higher than the figures we are currently drooling over.  And how much higher are we talking?

And we are definitely drooling.  Depending on which way this misunderstanding goes, there could be some serious backlash here.  I foresee 2 different possibilities:

1. Max repair costs for most planes are significantly reduced, and most everyone is happy.

2. Max repair costs remain the same or similar, but per the second note above damage percentage calculation has been adjusted to be more precise taking into account the exact conditions of the crash, (belly landings, engines still running, intact fuelselage/wings, etc) so the average repair cost is lower *in theory*.  

Option one sounds awesome.  The prospect of breaking even or even making money flying your favorite aircraft just became a whole lot more plausible.  Hell, feasible even.

The second option however **will** result in backlash, and let me tell you why.  

Let's assume that the repair costs are the same as they are today, but there is a shiney new system to be more precise with damage percentages.  Sounds great for those low speed belly landings, or getting shot out of the pilot seat while repairing at the airfield.  But total loss of aircraft control at high altitudes will result in a violent crash destroying the aircraft completely.  Therefore, high altitude deaths will still result in a max repair cost in most cases, negating any real possibility of getting a break through this partial repair percentage system.  

And who is (or should be) at high altitudes consistently?  Which planes more often than not will be victims of total loss of control at high altitude?  The hangar queens are- the jets and heavy bombers.  The same people who stand to gain the most from these economy buffs.  The same people who leave their planes in the hangar because their prized plane is too expensive to repair.  The same people that are all drooling over the idea of being able to fly their favorite aircraft without needing therapy after getting shot down.  This second possibility will basically be giving everyone a break on repair bills, except heavy bomber and jet pilots.

I have a feeling that option 2 is coming.  Please somebody prove me wrong.  Has anyone received repair bills on the dev server today who can shed some light on this?  I know that some devs hang out here too who could weigh in.  I'm begging to be proven wrong here.

**EDIT- As of 6/1, I appear to have been proven wrong.  Repair costs are even lower now, and the tooltip reads Max Repair Cost.**"	t5_2uc6j	True

2) When adding 1 plane to the system, make sure that it has fair counterparts in the other factions. This would help avoid dora incidents.

3) Teamkilling fine becomes the maximum repairbill of the plane you shot down, and the victim gets a free repair.

4) Correction of some flight models would be fantastic. (Yak-9, etc). 

5) light bombers/Attackers that do not have a normal bomb sight get a small dot on the ground to make their job a *bit* easier.

6) Allow players to skip planes in the tech trees. Do this by making them pay half of the cost of the plane they're skipping. They can opt to pay the other half if they ever choose to put the plane into service.

7) Make matchmaking boundaries 1-10, 5-15 and 10-20. This way anyone flying a plane under level 10 can't go against a jet.

Vitality can be leveled up much more quickly, and from my personal experience, the one-hits seem to stop around level 15 (unless it's a cannon or multiple hits). That's ~ 30xp.

To me, avoiding those horrible one-hit kills, especially in the biplanes, is much, much more important than a few seconds spent reloading. At the low levels we're talking about, a reload skill of 5 will give a reduction of 5%, so just a couple of seconds for mg's, three or four seconds for bombs. If I have to wait to reload, it's frustrating but rarely does it cost me a kill. I've had games where I get one-shot multiple times, on one occasion *four* goddamned times in one match. That costs me a whole bloody plane.

So... yes, by all means, train reload skill up as a priority. But hit 15 or so vitality *first*."	t5_2uc6j	True
1365105831.0	1bolvv	[AB] Eye opening Russian experience.	HelmutVonHelmut	34	9	83	"After struggling to catch a break all day yesterday in my American aircraft, I decided to cheese it up in my Russian planes. Now, I'm level 7 RU, however most of that was pre-1.29 leveling done with Reserve aircraft, while I own all available RU aircraft up to level 7, I have not flown any of them very much. 

To put it simply: I am absolutely blown away by the handling and durability of the Yak-series aircraft. For that were built using outdated and primitive construction methods and materials, they can absorb an absolutely unreal amount of punishment. For instance, I had one match in which my entire aircraft was beet red, except for the left wing and rudder, which were black...the aircraft still flew like it was brand new, reaching maximum speed and incurring zero handling penalties. I racked up a few more kills with an aircraft that should have augered in long go.

Thought I should make this thread and try to help some of the newer players out there gain some perspective. There are a few things to keep in mind when after more XP points. You can read some tips [here](http://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/20878-mariks-flight-techniques-and-how-to-win/) and kudos to Marik for making that thread. Just scroll down and find the **EXPERIENCE** Spoiler tab. I suggest you read through the whole topic, since it's very informative.

Furthermore, once you start feeling comfortable with aiming in Arcade Mode, **make sure to start doing Historical Battles!** The amounts of XP you gain there are increased *considerably*. You will get more XP out of 500-800 pts in HB, than 2000-3000 points in Arcade. Not only that, but planes also behave *realistically*, and you get to experience another level of aerial combat. Arcade is very fun, while it's less rewarding to win there, both in terms of money/xp gains and of the feeling you might gain from success. At first I was very intimidated by the gameplay of HB, as well as by the lack of the little aiming circle, which is actually not helpful at all and in reality it motivates you to shoot in the wrong way. After... perhaps 3 or 4 HB games I started getting the grip of it. I feel much better, now that the aim-circle is gone. In fact, I believe its removal improved my aiming a *lot*. Even more, now I try to fly smarter and consider the situations I find myself in, because I've only got 1 aircraft to fly. There is not much ramming, if any at all, and people tend to be more wary and sneaky. Last, but not least, you level up your plane skills, as well as your nation. Gradually you get better at flying the plane you've chosen to fly, and you unlock crew points for it.

I strongly recommend Arcade-only players to navigate themselves to [HB] and join the fun! Don't be overwhelmed, relax and enjoy it as much as possible. "	t5_2uc6j	True

Curious thing is, since my highest rank in country is 9 in USSR, and unchecked automatic repair, I never had lions cash problems to buy the planes that I unlocked. I think that won't be a problem in a while :)"	t5_2uc6j	True

1373171955.0	1hsd98	Suggestion: Bomber Co-Op in Squads	Sh4nanigans	29	3	31	"So imagine playing with your squad in your favorite bomber plane. Any bomber from American, German, Soviet, British, or Japanese tree, the tier of the bomber depending on your squad level (or maybe just choose any bomber you like). You and your squad are responsible for carrying out a mission personally made to put all action on your bomber.
Roles could be played out as so:

Pilot: all flight is AI controlled; AI follows specific, prewritten path based on the mission.

Bomberman (as i like to call Bombdropperguy): the most important person from the squad for the mission. one person from squad is responsible for using bomb sight and dropping bombs whereas required in the mission. Mainly responsible for completing the mission. Can change view from bomb sight to inside virtual cockpit (not at the pilot seat). Suggestions about bomberman subbing in as an additional gunner

Gunners: 3 of the other squad members  (4 if counting gunnerman as additional sub) are responsible for taking control of the gunnery and defending the bomber. Mainly responsible for preventing the whole squad from being shot down and failing the mission. Guns may or may not overheat or have additional ammo near them (suggestions please!). Can change views from first person to 3rd person.

The best planes to fit these missions might be PBY's, KI-49's, He-111's, or Wellingtons, for all of them can accommodate all squad members as gunners. The remaining spots for gunners will be taken up by AI.

I think that it could also incorporate different squads into one big mission, or possibly a whole clan, and it seems like it would be a lot of fun. I might have forgotten a lot of ideas I had when I started the idea, so any thoughts?

First thing you want to do is download xpadder. It's usually paid, but you can use the free version that's a bit outdated. 

http://en.kioskea.net/download/download-3137-xpadder

Install it, plug in your controller. Leave everything at default. The point of using xpadder is it smooths out your controls. In FRB, there's a huge tendency for the controller to shake your view a lot. Using xpadder will smooth it out. As for control settings, play on Full Controls so you can set trim.

To use the same setting I have, just copy paste is into a blank text document and rename it to anything with a .blk extension (like xbox.blk) This lets you import the controls. 


Got this tuned for FRB mostly, probably can't make as sharp turns in arcade due to some of the settings.




**Explanation of the controls.**

* Left joystick is your main joystick, affects the roll and pitch. 

* Yaw is set to both bumpers, which I found much easier for adjustments. 

* Right joystick is free look. So you can look while piloting instead of holding down a key to look

* Left trigger is zoom

* Right is fire (Machine guns and cannons)

* Bombs is A

* Rockets is X

* View is toggles by Y

* Map is B
 
* Left stick press reloads

* Dpad UP and DOWN control throttle

* Dpad RIGHT held and Right stick press toggles flaps

* Dpad LEFT held and Right stick press toggles airbrakes

* Back/Select opens statistics

* Start pauses

Ain't the best joystick out there, but you gotta work with what you got :)

On that note, since I'm currently in the test server as a public user (If it's open to the public, I highly doubt there is an NDA), I'll be taking questions about the things that have changed, if you don't want to go re-download the entire game for what may only be an hour or two of an open server.

**Edit:** Info we have currently:

B-25 does not have a 75mm cannon.

New planes are: 2 B-25's, 7 Do.217's, 2 Tu-2's, 1 G5N1, 1 G8N1, and 1 Meteor F.8

Entire UI changed.

Plane prices and upgrade prices have been raised

Repair prices have been, for the most part, reduced severely.

Free repair times have been reduced as well. (P-47 went from a week to 1 day)

Muleo	36	12	44	"This is something that's been annoying me for a while: the amount of bugs and suggestions aimed at the devs being posted here. Reddit is for sharing things with the community, unless it's some interesting content or something starting an interesting discussion, it doesn't really belong here: posting something here for 7000+ people to see in the hopes that a dev will notice it is a bit silly.

When people post bugs, the devs probably aren't seeing it (especially not the devs in charge of squashing bugs). The only thing that happens 99% of the time is batidari coming in and asking the person to submit a bug report. It's a waste of her time, waste of everyone else's time and screen real estate on this subreddit. So what I propose is a new rule that bug reports aren't allowed here, they should be posted to the appropriate official channels instead.

And this is the interesting idea: I propose a new flair for suggestions to the devs, I can make a new page where it shows the top suggestion topics. Hopefully the devs will see this and it can serve as a sort of ""Reddit wishlist"" for the game, what the people of Reddit think would be awesomest for War Thunder.

Regular discussions about ideas can continue as normal here (as long as it makes for interesting discussion), but actual suggestions will be flaired (and removed from the rest of this subreddit) so they can be sorted into a special page for suggestions. This will hopefully be less annoying for everyone else (less clutter) and hopefully more useful for the devs since they'll be able to see what we as a group think are the most important issues."	t5_2uc6j	True

1375597480.0	1jo3q9	Dev server stuff from last test.	Anti_People	25	2	74	"Did a little bit of testing with mostly existing planes, I didn't have the rank to fly any of the new jets. + some other musings and overheard tidbits. All dodgy testing done in HB mode.

- Spit MkIX, MkXVI, and Tempest (Tempest - from what I read on the forums) now have a '150 octane fuel' upgrade which increases engine power by a decent amount (200+hp for the Spit MkIX for example). The Spit IX now climbs insanely well (listed stat was 29.4m/s with full upgrades). I tested the Spit MkIX, it climbs better than a 109 G2 by around 9km/h between 3000m and 4000m at 15 degrees and full WEP.

- Spit Mk I has 100 octane fuel upgrade, I didn't test this, but yay for spitty mk I.

- Upgrade system seems ok, I don't particularly like that you essentially start with a gimped plane (doesn't perform as well as a plane in 1.31 for example) until you upgrade it to historical values, prices are OK I guess for a one off. I couldn't see a way to remove upgrades from a plane.

- Upgrade system now incorporates buying upgrades with Eagles, negating the XP grind.

- 109 F4, and trop version, also G2 now have the upgrade for 2 extra 20mm cannons each for a total of 3 cannons per plane with around 450 ammo in total. Stats are affected by weight of pylons and whatnot.

- FW190 A5 has the option to add an extra FOUR 20mm cannons via wing pylons for a total of SIX 20mm cannons.

- FW190 F8 has the option for 30mm cannon pylons (~~or alternatively 20mm cannons I think~~). Didn't test this plane. **Only an extra 2 x 30mm cannons for this plane.**

- P47, P51, P38, Hellcat haven't had their updated FM's added to the dev server yet from what I could tell (no working WEP on some planes etc).

- Corsair still seems to be over climbing, expected FM update incoming from what I gather.

- Tested a couple of RU planes, didn't seem much different, though I heard the LALA's now fly a tad more realistically with more accurate bleeding of speed in turns and such.

- IL4 now gets more bomb loads.

- Bearcats seem like decent planes, at tier 15 and 16. First bearcat has 4 x 50's (M3 50 cals). So the firing is quite a bit faster, and has a decent new sound effect. Second bearcat has later model 20mm's with new sound effect. Seems to climb pretty good unupgraded, should be beastly with upgrades and FM tweaks. Cockpit wasn't uploaded to the dev server.

- BTD seemed rather slow, probably more of a world war mode plane than the current shooting gallery fest, and decent bomb loadout options.

- I couldn't really test the new gunnery dynamics in matches as I seemed to be having connection issues with joining a game (450 ping from Australia, with packet loss), and also upgrading planes. I had to externally close the game every time I upgraded a part on a plane and relaunch. But from what I've heard MG's are now more effective, and 20mm's are also more effective. (Hispano's now have a new sound effect).

- A lot of FM's are still borked with their Engine Management options, such as superchargers, the P51 would actually lose speed with the supercharger turned on above 3000m, and some other planes with superchargers did nothing with the SC turned on. FM updates should hopefully rectify this.

- I've heard the Sabre is now a beast, and now has the later model .50 cals.

- Vampire currently has the Mig15 FM

- Some decals (50% of them at a guess) now cost 200 gold to use, not sure about skins. **See Edit below.**

- The crew healing skill has been replaced by a Weapon Management skill which reduces overheating/bullet spread and bomb spread. So throw your spare crew points into healing if you haven't already.

- Bomber gunners now seem more accurate, and have the choice of different ammo belts.

That's about all I can remember after 9 hours sleep. Here's a few screenies I took, nothing amazing.

http://imgur.com/a/gCwYW

**Additional:** Repair prices have been altered, Sabre is something around 25k to repair in HB. Me262 is still ridiculously expensive. Me163 slightly cheaper around 60k lions in HB. Most of the new jets are around 25-35k to repair. I'm guessing this is a base price before they take into account statistics, so expect these to rise in the future. Sabre has been updated slightly as far as I've heard, so it sounds like they've reset the repair for a base efficiency test considering the FM and weapon changes. This is all an uneducated and uninformed guess on my part.

**Edit:** From Johnny_G93 in the comments;

&gt; Actually decal and skin system works a little bit like a plane mod system. They are unlockable through completing achievements, but if you dont want to grind them you can unlock them with 200 gold. Another thing is that P-40, Mustang Mk1 and Spit IX have all skins unlockable so you dont have to fly your Spitty over Kuban etc.

**More:** Lots of planes have additional bomb loads, JU88, JU87 range, even the Arado has a 1000kg loadout now."	t5_2uc6j	True

Axis queue times are now fast while allied queue times are often in the 2-3 minute range. This is because there is no USA v. Soviet map anymore.

The apparent increase in USA and Soviet pilots is because they can no longer be matched against each other.

In the first match, the Germans have reached the city's outskirts and are striving to achieve air superiority. Meanwhile, the soviets are launching a last ditch effort to defeat the armored spearhead. In the second match, the Soviets have sent their forces in motion to crush the last resistance of the beleaguered 6th Army after its commander, General Paulus, refuses an offer of surrender.

Soviets have 3 lives, 1 must be a bomber.

The Soviets must attempt to kill the panzers coming towards the city. The Germans must stop them and defeat a similar Soviet armored force coming through the city.


* Match 2: Op Uranus

Germans have 3 lives, 1 must be a bomber

Soviets have 3 lives, 1 must be a bomber

The Germans are flying a forlorn attempt to fulfill Herman Goring's promise to keep Stalingrad fighting by destroying the bridges across the Volga River and the Soviet tank columns attacking the 6th Army's defenses. The Soviets are intent upon crushing the surrounded German's resistance once and for all.

[Ardennes HB map update](http://forum.warthunder.ru/index.php?/topic/34326-planiruemye-izmeneniia-na-ardennakh-v-129/)

**Arcade missions**

*(Updated 4th April 2013)*

**[Domination] Khalkhin-Gol**

In this mission there are three airfields and a few ground units, units help to capture these airfields. The action takes place on the historical map (looks like he meant that the map looks like the historical place).

**[Domination] Mozdok**

Same mission with the three airfields and ground units but there are some defenses and fortifications in the center of map.  Also map looks like the historical place.

Then dev speaks about the suburbs of Berlin map but as I know it’s already in game. 

**HB missions**

**Belated convoy. Britain.** *(Updated 20th April 2013)*

The mission is mostly for low-level planes.

German ship convoy was forced to come near to the coast of England because of the storm. As soon as the weather cleared, Luftwaffe sent planes to cover the convoy from the air. RAF tries to do anything to stop the convoy. 

The Germans will start in the air, and they have no opportunity to rearm and the Britain will start at the airfield.


German convoy consists of 18 cargo ships that can be destroyed by machine guns. Cargo ships are covered by destroyers that battered by the storm, as well as several patrol boats. British have AI torpedo-beaufighters. Shortly after the start of the mission, they begin to gather in threes and fly to torpedo convoy, and then handle ships with guns. Germans can fully focus on protecting the convoy and shoot down beaufighters before they attack. 

Since the Germans had no opportunity to rearm it’s done that way: shoot down one beaufighter is easer then to sink one cargo ship.
In addition the English have a few light pillboxes, trucks traveling on different routes and AAAs. Destroying those DOES NOT affect the outcome of the mission but is profitable as always.


Terms of winning the mission: British must destroy 18 cargo ships, Germans must shoot down 18 AI beaufighters and protect the convoy.

Also Germans will win if convoy reaches the certain point.


**Iwo Jima** *(Updated 27th March 2013)*

The mission is mostly for middle or high-level planes.

USA invades Iwo Jima island.
The Japanese fleet had just been soundly defeated, and therefore cannot provide assistance to the troops of the island. Americans are coming to the island as part of a powerful fleet and going to make a landing.

On their misfortune on Iwo Jima are located somewhat obsolete bombers D3N, which the Japanese are fitted with bombs and explosives and using as kamikaze against USA fleet.

The entire coast of the Iwo Jima turned into a fortress with lots of pillboxes and artillery.

There are 3 aims for both parties in the mission, execution of each affects the victory.  This way you can win without destroying all of the ground units.

**Mozdok** *(Updated 21th March 2013)*

This mission is mostly for low-level aircrafts and there are no heavy armored ground units and there is a little decrease in the distance between the airfields (30 km instead of 40).


German troops reached the bank of the Terek and going to strike the final blow to lose Soviet troops from their positions. However, the Soviets ferry troops across the river in order to organize the defense.

This mission is a short sketch of Mozdok-Malgobek defensive operation which happened in autumn 1942.  

Soviet forces are in defense and try to hold back the German infantry, tanks and armored troop-carriers.


German side has several well-defended fuel depots, which are one of the objectives of the mission for the Soviet side. On the part of the Soviet Union there are similar stores, but located randomly along a riverbank and poorly covered. Those who interested can try to catch the German motorcyclists who carry out patrol for two fuel depots, plying between German stores. Killing them won’t affect the outcome of the mission and won’t bring you lions or XP but they dying and falling down dramatically.

In addition to the trenches, infantry, artillery and light pillboxes Soviet side has a convoy of trucks trying to evacuate part of the supplies and troops across the Terek for the future defense.

**Honolulu** *(Updated 4th April 2013)*

The mission is mostly for low-level planes.

Pearl Harbor - is the largest naval base of the United States in the Pacific. Knowing that the main forces of USA are distracted by attack on Midway, the Japanese forces attempting to capture the port.


The Japanese team has a squadron of Japanese bombers, under the control of AI.  Americans will have to think about climbing and shooting them down and the Japanese will have to think about the cover.
Japanese players who choose the bomber as their plane can join this squadron, thus increasing the density of the protective fire of the turrets.

Both sides have 1 aircraft carrier, and the Japanese, beside this capturing an airfield on the island in the beginning of the mission.


The battle itself is divided into several sectors:


* Japanese bombers 

* Japanese and U.S. Navy 

* Japanese and American ground units, including the port of Pearl Harbor.

**Ardennes map update** *(Updated 21th February 2013)*

In the next major patch 1.29 this changes can be expected *(yeah, I know)*:


1. Germany's air defense considered that 37mm FLAKs more needed in the eastern front, replaces them with 20mm anti-aircraft guns. The density of the fire at medium altitude should drop significantly. 

2. Unleashing tank unit armed with the Tigers, the Germans sent it to aid their forces. Germany now has two tank wedges - from the north and east.

3. Realizing that the pillboxes within the city are not very efficacious, the German engineers have carried them to the outskirts of the city, now they covering the major highways.

4. German squadron of He-111 failed to start the engines due to cold and they left somewhere in the distant airfield, respectively Germans no longer have to cover the bombers.


5. But the American bombers feel luckier, and they stepped up their bombing squadron. Now it is 12 B-17, flying at an altitude of 4 km. The German fighters now have tasty, but very dangerous goal (as formation flying and cover each other with fire of onboard shooters). Accordingly, the Germans issued a mission to destroy American bombers, and the Americans job is to protect them.

6. Fixed bugs in movements of units

7. Airfields. Both sides have got new airfields and even a very drunk pilot can land B-17 safely. Gradually airfields will be replaced on other maps.

8. The Americans have replaced m5 stuart tanks with m4 sherman.

*That's all for now.*



PS: Nobody knows for sure when all of this will come, but as far as I know these maps are ready to be implemented and hopefully arrive in the next major patch.

Also there are a lot of rumors that devs preparing something for the 9th of May (Victory Day) and that there would be HB event - Battle for Berlin, maybe it’s true maybe not.

(If you would find grammar, logic or spelling mistakes please point them out to me, I am not native speaker)

Unfortunately in AB playing one the way it's supposed to be played is basically just instant death.  I was so frustrated I almost gave up on the Stuka and then I discovered the AB way to play it.      Here's my tips.

Train your crew (gunner too) to extremely high G-Force.

At spawn drop your bombs immediately.. Start to climb.  By dropping the bombs you climb quite decently.. they will reload by the time you need them.

3.5K is your minimum bombing run start altitude.  

Your dive angle is almost straight down.. 85 degrees or so.

You should be reaching a speed of 700+ during this dive.

Drop your first bomb early so you still have dive time to line up your second target.

After bombs away pull out of the dive and climb at 60-70 degrees.  WEP all the way until engine sputters.  

Your guns are not to take out ground targets, they are not to battle other planes.  They are to get out of hairy situations only.   Even that near perfect sitting duck target is going to get you killed.  

If during the dive you decide to level out (to go after some target) instead of immediately climbing.. well you're most likely dead.  

If you have someone climb to 3K+ to shoot you down, DIVE STRAIGHT down.  At about 300 use your dive brakes and turn/level out.  It's important you turn at least 90 degrees, preferably 180 degrees from the direction originally going.  Enjoy watching the other guy smash into the ground 7 times out of 10.   The other times he'll pull out but never in the direction your going.  Should he pull out in your direction then he'll hugely overshoot you, you have dive brakes going after all.  Don't be tempt to pursue and shoot at him, just dump your bombs and start climbing again.  Don't get tempted to shoot at someone.. Climb and get to work for the Führer

I welcome any input and if you have a completely different style of play for AB stukas and don't mind sharing please do!  Maybe I'll take some of your play style and mesh it with mine."	t5_2uc6j	True

1365723571.0	1c65dd	[FRB]I'm loving FRB, but there's a few problems that make this game mode horribly broken.	ToadFoster	26	4	20	"So I've been playing tons of FRB lately and with my TrackIR and joystick I've been having way more fun than in any of the other game modes. However as it is now the game mode is just completely broken and until they fix these issues I just can't play it anymore.

1. **AI Airplanes:** This one goes for historical battle also, but it's even more terrible in FRB as shooting down other airplanes is even harder. These thing are just a joke. I've followed a Buffalo in a Yak-3 going about 400km/h faster than my top speed doing barrel rolls. Sometimes they just fly in a slow straight line but other times they fly like they have some sort of anti-gravity devise that lets them ignore the laws of physics. I've lost games because the last AI just did nothing but fly in circles at 700km/h over enemy AAA, which brings me to my next point.

2. **AAA:** As it is right now AAA isn't visible and the only explanation I can come up with is that it's some sort of bug. You have no idea if AAA is shooting at you so often you'll just be cruising along and suddenly your wing falls off because some invisible flak cannon was shooting at you for the past 5 minutes and you didn't even know it. The only AAA that seems to show up is the AAA at airfields which is horribly overpowered.

3. **Bombers:** This one sort of goes for HB but again, like the AI airplanes, it's much worse for FRB. As it it right now there is absolutely no reason that anybody should choose a bomber. There's just no point. I've literally never seen a game won because of all the ground targets being destroyed, it's always because of enemy losing all their planes. Bombers need a bigger roll because right now their only roll seems to be getting shot down by invisible AAA. 

4. **Weather:** Haha, you thought it was bad in HB when it was raining and cloudly, try FRB where you get no indication of where your enemy is except for a black dot. Now add to that the fact that for some bizarre reason you still get glare off your windows from the sun through all that cloud and rain and you have just about the least fun experience in the game. Nobody would be trying to bomb ground targets in weather like that in real life, so why is it in FRB?

So that's about it for the major issues I can think of right now. There's many other smaller issues  but these are the ones that in my opinion are making it unplayable. All of my most fun experiences have been in FRB, but also all of my worst ones which is a shame, because I think FRB has the potential to be just about one of the most fun multiplayer experiences on the market.

It's horrendous..

The lag is incredible, my B25 could be downed with a pistol, my TBF-1 Avenger, which was [bulletproof](http://imgur.com/wdCIBXG), is now a waste of time and for both of these have to have bombs aimed in bomber view which is so irritating! My P47 Thunderbolt can't climb to save it's life, my IRL incredibly maneuverable Kingcorba is now a flying pig.. The F4U Corsair is incapable of flight and my F6F Hellcat which was an ocean interceptor is so god dam slow! And that's just my American units..

The British, I'm glad the Beaufighter VIc is now not supersonic, and I like this! But the 20mm canons are useless now, and it was downed in 1 shot from a P26.. A Peashooter.. My Spitfire fell apart trying to bounce some and my Hurricanes could take incredible damage but not deal it.. They have a reputation for being flying tanks because they can take and deal damage!

[Hey, the Black Cat would be great for this...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_PBY_Catalina#Night_attack_and_naval_interdiction)  They would repaint Catalinas black, outfit them with loads and loads of ammunition, silenced machine guns, bombs and primitive surface-scanning radar, and would head out at night to raid Japan's shipping convoys and sink the softer surface craft, and were pretty damn successful. 

I thought it would be an easy addition to War Thunder because we already have:

* Catalina models
* Gunner mechanics
* Patrol Boats &amp; Landing Craft sea maps
* Bomber pilots who fly at 100 feet ASL

It'd totally trade off the heavy 4,000lb bomb load for some additional crew to man some twin linked machine guns to chew up boats.   Might actually make those types of matches fun. "	t5_2uc6j	True

1372612740.0	1hdfff	Custom Spitfire Wingtips?	Ehpex	29	5	24	"Would anyone else like to see more customizable options for aircraft? Gaijin did a great job of adding and implementing wing mounted cannons for some of the German fighters. It is quite nice to be able to set up a plane for a specific mission. If you are bomber hunting 3 x 30mm should help but in dogfights maybe you don't want the extra weight and chose a single 30mm. These options can give 2 identical planes a unique way to fly.

It shouldn't shock anyone that the Spitfire throughout the second world war had many design changes made to it. 24 different marks of spitfires were produced, from 1938-1948, each with many sub-categories. In War Thunder very major changes to fuselage and engines would be to large of a change away from the original plane and therefore couldn't be added the same way as the wing cannons. So why not add different wing tip configurations, here are the 3 main types used and their aerodynamic properties.

* [Elliptical wings](http://www.spyflight.co.uk/images/jpgs/supermarine%20spitfire%20pr19/Spitfire%20PR19%20from%20port.jpg): the standard used by Spitfires during WW2, effective to reduce wing tip effects

* [Clipped wings](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2710/4254741100_91e22e9f9f_b.jpg): Used to increase roll rate of the Spitfires that works at low altitudes hunting dive bombers but suffered at high altitudes

* [Extended wings](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/Spitfire_VII_Langley_USA.jpg): added wing surface to increase lift at high altitudes.

completely inaccurate nature of the american prop planes, and as a result of my close proximity to the sabre (which is apparently the kind of the skies, as it should be) I have been grinding my heart out for it.

I wasn't just spamming ground targets or anything like that, I was actually playing my F4U-1c and attempting to get as many air kills as possible (normally impossible as my team's wouldn't climb to altitude and instead prefer to circle-jerk at low altitudes).

So yesterday, I get home, patch my game, and then hop back in my F4U-1c. I get 6 kills my first round. Must have been a fluke, I thought, so I play another. 4 kills, and I still don't have a scratch. There was mention of .50 cals being ""punchier"" in one of the chats, so I decided to take my P51 out. As normal, I found myself in a game with all Doras, and ended up in an AMAZING dogfight that consisted of me counter bouncing 3 boom and zooming Dora's for about 15 minutes straight (Something I don't think I've ever managed in the p51) at 5000m, before a few friendlies managed to get over and help me finish off all of them. I ended the round with 4 kills (2 of the doras, and 2 stragglers.) I had another 4 rounds ranging from awesome to mediocre (and I noticed that all of the rounds I did terrible in, we lost, so I presume it was due to a lack of teamwork.)

Then I decided to get in my P47 and give it a a try. Fortunately for me, I kept getting bastogne, so I put on my close air support hat and set out to kill some tanks. After getting quite a few ground kills, I assisted some friendlies in killing a few FW190s that were trying to turn-fight at low altitudes, and then set out for home to reload. At some point, a dora got the drop on me and got quite a few hits on me. Normally the P47 would have bursted into flames after seeing the mere shadow of a dora, but not this time. A friendly was already hauling ass over to assist me, and I managed to delay my death long enough for the friendly to scare him off. With my entire aircraft black and red, I made it back to the airfield and reloaded. I think I ended the game with 1500 points, conssisting of 2 a2a kills and close to 25 gound kills.


So, has anyone else noticed anything different about the Americans? Or anything for that matter, I feel like Gaijin has been adjusting balance in quiet and not putting it in patch-notes (which I can completely understand the reasoning behind.) "	t5_2uc6j	True

1368404197.0	1e7p0v	[AB] The Etiquette of Swarm-Tailing	TomCollins7	26	3	31	"I get it. It's arcade. No one owes anyone else a modicum of fucks and the top score is all that matters. That being said, there are a few tips out there that will help you look classy the next time you run into players on the server. This one has to do with situations in which 5 blue planes are trailing 1 red. 

The first thing i'd like to say is that in AB, it's no sin as far as I'm concerned. The atmosphere is all-out melee, so there's no reason to bitch about who ends up with the kill. Therefore, 5-1 engagements are inevitable--embrace them.

Second, as a simple rule of self-preservation, when in a swarm-tail, you don't know the guy behind you from adam; he may not give a shit if he kills you as long as he gets the kill. That means you have to sweep--for his sake and yours. Kick out to the left or right of the target to allow the other members of the swarm a vector to the target that does not include you. I call that a win-win scenario. 

Third, and moreso an addendum to the second point, if you hover just off the target's tail, you have no right to bitch about being killed by a member of your own team. You knew what you signed up for---hovering around the target's hindquarters' in a swarm is akin to taking yourself hostage for him. And as we all learned from the Hollywood blockbuster ""Speed,"" the solution in that scenario, is to shoot the hostage. 

Third and finally, when you're in the swarm, fly predictably. That means when the target banks left, and all the members of the swarm bank left, your wings stay at the same level of inclination, and your engine stays at the same level of thrust throughout the entire turn. This makes your plane predictable--and that's the name of the game.  

Fourth, if you get hit by another member of the swarm, don't bitch about it. First of all, you knew what this was--what you signed up for. When it goes bad--don't cry about the other pilot's skill, the toughness of the target's plane, or your own; by entering the swarm, you have made a conscious choice to take the risks inherent in this dangerous formation. Deal with it. 

Air collisions usually happen when someone does something spontaneous and unpredictable. And while we all prefer not to be part of a target swarm in [AB], it happens, and this need not be one of those unpredictable scenarios, if we all follow these simple rules. Good luck out there.

1367869778.0	1dt8co	The D-13 plague is ruining HB.	28_06_42_12	44	23	168	"This is a serious problem, and Gaijin NEEDS to address it. There are currently 34 German players in rank 13-14 alone waiting for a game in HB. I have no doubt that all but a handful of those planes are D-13s. Why is this a problem? There are 24 players of ALL TIERS COMBINED waiting for a game as USA, meaning there are currently more D-13s automatching than there are Allied pilots to fight them. 

If I get a HB match on Ruhr, I don't even bother to check the fighters on the other team anymore, because I know there will be at least 5 FW190 D-13s waiting for me, and there is no way I can pay for the repair cost on my P-47 before a Dora blows my wings off.

Either raise the repair cost on the D-13, bring it up to a higher tier and FIX AUTOMATCH TO DO A DECENT JOB WITH TIERING PLAYERS, or lower the performance of the D-13. I want to be able to play HB as US again."	t5_2uc6j	True

Q: How is it that I can set someone on fire multiple times and in the same place ?  
A: Its a bug and will be changed in the future  
  
Q: Why is mouse aim more resistant to damage than other kind of control ?  
A: Damage is same but mouse aim is given assists to keep flying (instructor).  
  
Q: Planes are hard to spot between 1000 to 5000 meters distance.  
A: Its being addressed by future development, it will be sorted out.  

Q: (I muted the guy due to excessive mic hissing) ? Hispano ? MG-FF ?.  
A: You have to wait for the coming update, most of the weapons including Hispano cannon will be reconsidered. Hispano cannon will be more precise and their explosive shells will be more reasonable and more efficient. MG cannons will have more fragmentation/splash.  
  
Q: Ki61 Ic got wrong cannons they used Type 2 HO5 20mm not MG151.  
A: Post your documentation and sources on the forum and if we are wrong we will change it.  
  
Q: Is there any plans to change how Hispano cannons are fired? Like a shotgun effect (recoil and fragmentation).  
A: The recoil is calculated by the physics of the plane, flight model and the location of the cannons.  
 
Q: Will we be able to use several ammo belts for our planes with multiple MGs of the same caliber ? 
A: We plan to this but not now, we know historically americans and brits loaded more tracer rounds for the left wing MGs.  
 
Q: Is the japanese Type 99 Mark II cannon performing correctly in HB? Are they bit too good or not historically accurate ?.  
A: In comparison with the other cannons they are working correctly. In the upcoming patch their behavioure will be changed as will the other cannons.  
 
Q: Mosquito is missing bombload.  
A: They will be implemented.  
 
Q: A damaged wing behaves like its attached to an anchor.  
A: We will look into it.  
 
Q: Will we see accurate damage done to aircraft instead of generic damage decals.  
A: In time we would like to but its not easy work, its lot different materials/plane models and work. First priority is to get all FMs to work properly, bring more planes and make those work before adding more damage graphics.
  
Q: Will we see a bomb bigger than 4000 lbs.  
A: YES.  
 
Q: 50 Cal seems to need lot of hits to get a kill ?.  
A: Historically they needed lot of hits to get a kill.  
  
Q: Dealing with how damage is calculated are all rounds being applied their correct ballistic coefficients and if so is there a damage curve which reduces damage based on ballistic coefficient in regard to range ? 
A: Yes and next patch be more accurate taking into account air resistance and shape of the shell. The loss of energy is calculated depending on distance and curve, higher the caliber the faster it is drained of energy so cannons have less efficiency at long range then MGs.  
  
Q: Do you plan on adding more shell racks ?  
A: Yes there will be more ammo racks, for example Stukas G1/2 will get ammo belt containing just HEF as many like to use this plane for hunting bombers. Other ammo types for other planes coming as well.  
  
Q: Sometimes I see hit decal being applied to enemy without getting damage message ?.  
A: Its a bug that can happen if you cause non critical damage. Its on the todo list.  
  
Q: Will Japan finally get their first jet aircraft on the upcoming major patch ?  
A: Future development, so we can't talk about that.  
 
Q: Are you aware of a MM exploit about rank 12s getting into biplane games.  
A: Issue is solved on test server. Fix waiting to be deployed on live server.  
  
Q: Do tracer and ball rounds have different trajectories ingame ?  
A: Yes trajectory is based on muzzle velocity, mass, caliber and shell weight. We will talk more about how this in the future.  
 
Q: Mouse aim whine no.3214354682
A: When player population allows we plan to add filters so you have the option of just playing with other joystick users.  
 
Q: Ki61 climbs faster than it did in real life.
A: Yes we know about this and it will be fixed.
 
Q: Is there a way to keep game audio playing while alttabbed so I can hear the match loading beep? I spend my FRB queue time browsing /r/Warthunder / WT forum.  
A: We add not the sound but make the task bar icon for WT (aces.exe) flash, its not the highest priority.  
  
Q: How are the repair costs calculated especially differences between the game modes as example Fw190A5 cost 17k in HB and 24k in FRB while F8 cost 16k in both HB and FRB.  
A: Its calculated on the statistics on how well the plane does in this example the A5 does much better in FRB then F8.  
  
Q: What is the burnout time of the incendiary / tracer rounds ?  
A: What we have now in game is dependent on bullet lifetime. In general 7.7 mm bullets is effective to about 1,5 km to 2,0 km while higher calibers is effective to 2~3 km, falloff included.  
 
Q: Is there any chance you are going to change vitality/health of pilot and bomber gunners? I am a FRB player and its very hard to get enemy gunner unconscious/down. Its too far away from realistic. Is this ammo issue, crew issue or it this correct by your standards ?.  
A: This will be reworked in the major patch update.  
  
Q: I heard there was a rumor about players manning plane gunner positions in aircrafts.  
A: Translation error, said yes by mistake. Not happening sorry.  
  
Q: Will there be a possibility soon^TM that enables you and a friend to play a same match but on separate team as in versus each other ?  
A: Custom battles sure but not in random battles.  
  
Q: Will radar be implemented for night fighters and how will it be an advantage in say HB as we have icons ?  
A: At night the range of icons is reduced and again in bad weather. Radar will help with this as it don't care about bad weather.  
  
Q: There are some skins requiring kills on Malta to unlock can this be unlocked by playing custom games ?  
A: Cannot be unlocked by playing custom battles.  
  
Q: Ramming question people shoot at you before ramming into you and thus gets a kill award.  
A: We will look at this and improve.  

Q: Bullet dispersion right now it seems like bullet drop is modelled but its laser beam accuracy.  
A: Complex work but we continue to improve on this.  
 
Q: Many of the planes we fly are not suited for bad weather conditions  and in HB/FRB battle we often bad weather. Any plans to change the weather pattern ?  
A: Yes we will look into removing the worst conditions like night combined with rainstorms.  
  
Q: Nvidia owners experience micro freezes  
A: Make a bug report and attach the most recent .clog file to the report so the devs can take a deeper look and hopefully resolve the the issue.  
 
Q: With tank battles coming soon^TM, do you intend to create real 3d crates from artillery, bombs and so forth? Small tanks could use those as cover.  
A: Future development can't talk about that.  
 
Q: Will weather conditions change engine performance, ie crossing into a raincloud ?.  
A: We will think about it.  
 
Q: I have crash landed and I'm not getting repaired and rearmed what gives ?  
A: It depends on how damaged the plane is if its badly damaged the crew can't repair it.
  
Q: Are you doing to include Do 335 to the game ?  
A: Most probability yes.  
  
Q: Will there be an option in the hangar to see the number of consecutive days you have logged in and the number of days until next reward ?  
A: Post it to the suggestions at the forum.  
  
Q: Will there be Golden Eagles rewards for tournaments ?  
A: Yes.  
  
Q: In HB are there plans to continue the battle after the planes are shot down and let the ground forces decide the battle ?  
A: Not until player controlled ground forces are introduced.   
  
Q: When can we get a better Match Maker ?  
A:  Soon^TM.  
  
Q: AI gunners in bombers are not shooting at ground targets, could you change it when flying at low altitudes so its historically accurate ?  
A: Right now we focus on making them better at shooting air targets and until ground forces are introduced its not a high priority.  
  
Q: 40 mm and 37 mm Bofors had no shells with proximity fuse and at the moment in game they do could you change it ?  
A: They had proximity fuses but again if we are wrong we will change it.  
  
Q: Will you add adjustable bombsight, we would like to set height &amp; speed.  
A: It is coming, no due date.  
  
Q: Do you have a plan to increase the fuel of Rocket planes ?  
A: Changes will come to arcade Me163 and Ki200 different system of spending fuel. It will be more fun to fly them *in arcade*.  
  
Q: Is there possible to add something like a signal or waypoint marker for squadmates ?  
A: Most probably yes but after clan system is done.  
  
Q: Playing as squadron must be encouraged is it possible to have added silver lions and or xp bonus for playing as squadrons ?  
A: When playing in squadron you already have the benefit of teamwork which is more effective then playing solo so you will have better win rate and credit earnings.  
  
Q: Will you add German guided anti-shipping bombs ?  
A: Probability yes. Maybe not guided but different types of ammunition and bombs.  
  
Q: Will you allow carrier aircraft to fold their wings ?  
A: It is partially in the code base but its not 3d modelled yet, some time in the future.  
  
Q: Will Ar234 be placed at a lower rank?  
A: Not in the upcoming update.  
  
Q: Many players don't seem to like the black X that is on the tail of german planes could you replace it with Balkenkreuz ?  
A: Not sure about Balkenkreuz but the X sign will be removed from the tail for sure.  
  
Q: When will you implement economy improvements based on players feedback.  
**A: We will have a special economy update probability right before the global update or right after it. This will change the economy to a state between 1.27 and 1.29 so for the majority of people this is good news.**"	t5_2uc6j	True

1368669249.0	1efali	Give the Kill to the player who does the most damage (Post on War Thunder Forums)	fishbait32	36	15	42	"~~Hey guys,~~

~~I just posted on the War Thunder forums in the Ask the Devs a question. And I was proposed to them that they make the kills go to the player who does the most damage.~~

~~This will prevent your teammates from stealing your kills as you just chased a guy down for 5 minutes, and he is finally on fire and about to run into a mountain side.... but your teammate hits him once and he gets the kill. Very annoying and unfair/unbalanced.~~ 

~~So, if you guys wish to see this implemented follow this [link to my post on the official War Thunder forum and reply to it](http://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/35021-give-the-kill-to-the-player-who-did-the-most-damage/)~~ 

~~Also tell me what you think about it here as well, I'd be interested to read what your guys' opinions are on damage dealt to the enemy and who gets the kill.~~

**EDIT** So, from people just downvoting because they disagree with what I had to say in the comments, I didn't see a whole lot of discussion on what they disapprove of. 

It appears that the best idea is to increase the reward you get for making an assist on an enemy. This way you aren't always fighting for the kill because you get more points and because it counts towards achievements and looks better on your record/profile. Now it would create more of a challenge to get the kill just for the fact it would appear better on your profile/ help you unlock achievements that WarThunder may have, but you would still earn a good amount of exp just for assisting your team mate. 

The reason why the ""give the kill to the player who did the most damage"" won't work (From what I've read below in the comments) is that it would turn the game into a hitpoint system where each plane has X amount of health, and we can already kill the pilot out of a plane which may only do 10 damage while nailing a wing or fuselage gets you 80. With the system already, if you kill the pilot, you get the kill cause well you need a pilot to fly the plane.

What are your guys' thoughts on this type of system? Do you see any flaws it could have, such as advantages and disadvantages?  "	t5_2uc6j	True

1367365263.0	1dg2pa	[HB] Historical Battles is broken- a rant from the German perspective.	Frederick_the_Great	23	2	57	"Hi there r/WarThunder. I don't have a plan while writing this- just a lot of frustration. Bear with me if this devolves much.


An introduction for you all that will be a key part of understanding my rant: I play Germany as my far-and-away primary air force. I am Level 13 Germany, Level 8 Britain, and low level in every other air force. I also have been for about a month and a half now playing HB nearly exclusively.

In that time my enjoyment of the game has steadily decreased, and here's why: Every single day it seems like HB is just a bit worse than it was the day before. I'm well aware that there has been plenty of this from British and American players who can't seem to catch a break versus the mighty Reich, but this pilot feels exhausted and exasperated even in victory.

I want to present the problems that I have with HB as of this moment, and then take a moment and talk about what I think that solutions might be. I'd love to hear everyone's opinion on how the problems with HB can be solved so that we can give Gaijin some good thinking points and maybe return to the game that we love.


Problem 1: (Nearly) every time I get into the game the map is Ruhr.

I don't know what causes this; I know for a fact that Ruhr is not the only German HB map. We have 2 maps versus the russians, Korsun and some other non-snowy one I have only been on maybe 10 times so i don't even recall its name. We also have one over southern England that I have seen maybe twice and the Sicily map, which used to be so ubiquitous that Ruhr was refreshing. So, what gives? I would love to play more games against the Russians or the Brits on their own turf. Is the problem that there is a massive population of German and American players dwarfing all other factions? In any case, I am sick and tired of Ruhr and I think that a more random map rotation could help to reinvigorate HB.

Solution 1: Make maps other than Ruhr appear in the rotation more often, if practical.


Problem 2: The economy is broken- for all of us.

Really, the worst part about playing in HB these days is the stress of trying to make up more than my repair costs in Lions. The main reason that you see so many Doras these days is that the Dora is a bargain for its performance, making it easier to pay the insane costs of leveling up- putting the Bf-109 G-6, a level 13 fighter, into service costs over 1000000 lions. Hence, my mindset while going into battle has changed: I'm no longer there to have fun per say- instead, I'm desperate to make lions on the battle. Obviously this is not a suitable mindset to enjoy the game in- and it is a huge contributor to the mobbing of any available target by all nearby German fliers. We all need the money desperately.


Problem 3: The HB missions are monotonous even on different maps


I for one would appreciate more varied and more historical HB options beyond the plethora of tactical air-support missions we have. Someone on this subreddit suggested not that long ago that we have the US/UK vs Germany HBs start with the Germans on the ground and the US/UK at altitudes of at least 5000m. How hard would it be for Gaijin to put in a formation of B17s, where the objective of the Germans is to shoot them all down (for a hefty Lion reward, of course) and the objective for US/UK is to escort the bombers to the target successfully (for a hefty Lion reward, of course). Why not have a Blitz HB map where the roles are reversed? It's annoying for the game to be tactical air support to a Bf 109 pilot, and nothing is more ridiculous than climbing to 5000m to see maybe 1 US/UK pilot up that high- the realm where the air war was actually fought!


There are of course a slew of other issues- unfinished flight models, the high-tier weakness of US/UK fighters and German bombers, the complete and utter disregard of the Japanese by Gaijin for the last month. I can't stand to play arcade anymore and I can't do the FRB tutorial so I demand a fix to HB. And I want all of you to help.

1366443619.0	1cqc68	[Arcade] A few tips I have learned or picked up in my first few months playing.	iranoveryourdog	24	3	41	"I had no prior experience with any game like this in the past. I do have an aviation background and there was still a learning curve for me. After spending a long night playing arcade after arcade tonight and having to give out the same tips in almost every game I am going to try and post them here. I might be way off base as some of these might be common knowledge here.

- Know the aircraft. Know what the one you are flying can and can't do. Know what your target can and cannot do well and exploit it. Your P-39 will not beat that Spitfire you have been trying to turn fight for the last 25 seconds. 

- Please do not be 'that guy' that complains that a 37mm just killed you with one shot. Yes, it is a 37mm round. Your plane is small and [the round is huge](http://marinephotos.togetherweserved.com/199539_med.jpg). If it hits you it WILL hurt. [See?](http://www.56thfightergroup.co.uk/aircraft-page/41-6620%20-%20Lt%20Foster-1.jpg). 

- Do NOT ignore the enemy bombers. Some people say playing a bomber sucks, but any decent bomber pilot left alone for a long enough time will make the match end quick. On the flip side of that try and escort your bombers. I play Germany and I can't tell you how many times I climb at the start of the match and find 2 or 3 bombers with no escort. They make really slow easy targets for a 109.

- Use and abuse the environment. Are you in a Spitfire with a big slow loud thing tailing you? Lead him into a mountain or ground. Fly into the trees. Since arcade has targeting and name tags you gotta out think your enemy more often than out playing them.

- Being chased by a decent pilot? Try and lead him to your base or into your team. Tunnel vision is real. 

- Don't let yourself be led. Know when to break off. I have shot down a lot of planes who followed me for too long in a slower plane, realized their mistake way too late, then turned around - leaving their six wide open for me to take advantage of. */u/control-v*

-  It is helpful to aim for weak spots, especially with bombers. You can damage both of his engine and set him on fire with one salvo, or you can throw shots into his fuselage while his gunners chews at you.
Example http://youtu.be/lFKNgfLzRTc?t=4m38s start ats 4:40. */u/WhiteRevan*


- Learn how to ""jig"". It's amazing how effective this is and very few people do it. Basically this is the practice of performing erratic random movements when someone is on your tail. Even if all you do is perform an indefinite aileron roll while shaking your mouse around you will evade so many shots, since most players are heavily reliant on the arcade lead indicator. */u/control-v*

- Try not to fly at a bomber or most attack planes from a direct 6 o'clock. There is most likely guns back there. They have a big plane you probably do not. They will likely shoot you down.

- Don't trust the lead indicator. I have noticed that a lot of people in arcade aren't actually trying to predict your movements or actually lead you into gun fire. I have played with my yaw while being tailed only to have someone shoot at my planes orientation and not the actual flight path I'm taking. Try a few matches with it off. You will notice an improvement.

- For the love of god don't do the conga with an enemy plane. Rarely have I seen it actually take 6 people to kill one person. What usually happens is you all shoot each other, ram each other, or loose objectives while you all get kited in circles by an IL-2. A good BnZ player will also be able to pick you off from above as you focus on trying to snipe a kill from 5 other people. Picture a shark darting in and out of a swarm of fish. It is fun, and it is easy.

- If you can help it, stop spraying from your max range at the enemy. Get in close and make all your shots count. I had a hard time with this until I turned off my lead indicator. 

- When you are in a lull between fights always reload. With an aced crew and maxed reload speed it should be no more than 15 seconds to totally rearm. Don't get caught with only a few rounds.

- Constantly be aware of what is going on around you. Arcade is in 3rd person, take advantage. 

- Know the enemy team. I am not talking what their planes can do, but rather what planes they are in. I treat it just like I do in League of Legends. As often as possible I hit the tab key to see what type of aircraft and how many they have on the team. This really helps in picking out a target. If you look in a ground attack match and you see a team full of fighters with 2 bombers, it is probably a good idea to find and kill those bombers. 

- For anyone that's actually trying to win legit head-on engagements. Start firing when the opponent is within 1km and approaching, also try aiming your initial shots about bit higher.. about same amount as the ""height"" of the plane. After the opponent is within 500m, just break-off. If you hit with your initial salvo, they're most likely almost dead with engine gone and pilot most likely wounded. */u/W4lt3r89*

- Manually controlling the pitch/roll/yaw of the aircraft while trying to get onto a tail in a turn fight, or out maneuvering a tailing aircraft, is much better and more efficient/direct than simply pointing the mouse toward the enemy waiting for the automated controls to orient the aircraft directly. It's quite a noticeable difference. */u/Fun_Crusher*

- For anyone that plays on the US server. Stop being such dicks to each other. It is a game. 

Anyone else care to add anything? I only really have exp with USA and German planes up to high tier. So take what I posted with a grain of salt. I am especially not very versed in turn fighting.

**Before we start!**

- Please use the applicable [Arcade], [HB] or [FRB] tags to preface your opinions on the airplane! Aircraft performance differs *greatly* across the three modes, so an opinion for one mode may be completely invalid for another!

- Do not downvote based on disagreement! Downvotes are reserved for comments you'd rather not see at all because they have no place here.

- Feel free to speak your mind! Call it a hunk of junk, an OP 'noobtube', whatever! Just make sure you back up your opinion with reasoning.

- Make sure you differentiate between styles of play. A plane may be crap for turnfights, and excellent for boom-n-zoom, so no need to call something entirely shitty if it's just not your style.

 Then the repair counter is still ticking, but the plane slowly burns away until the repair counter starts counting upward, and then finally says it's ""too critically damaged to be repaired.""

 Now, I'm pretty sure that they had fire extinguishers back in WWII, I could be wrong though. I'm pretty sure that at least they had a waterhose. Either way, if the plane is already being repaired in the first place, I feel that flames should be put out or at the very least not be allowed to make the timer count upward. I think that having a fire extinguisher or a water hose on an airfield would be pretty much required, and for them to repair the plane in the first place, the fire would need to be put out. So if the timer is ticking in the first place, there should be no more flames. 

 I'm asking for either the flames to be totally put out when the repair timer starts ticking, or alternatively, some sort of other timer put in place for a fire crew or something to put out the flames.

I hope you can make it out! If you have any comments, questions, or suggestions feel free to leave them here! I may not be here on Thursday night so I would really appreciate it if someone could volunteer to host the game! If you have an idea for a custom game to play send me or /u/KraftyLine a message and we'll make it happen!"	t5_2uc6j	True
1369870450.0	1favne	Something irks me about captured planes.	ultilink	26	6	36	"No, not to do with economy for once!

The issue is more of a historical one.

Let's have a look at the American captured [BF109 F-4](http://i.imgur.com/jASWdFL.png)

It has a [MG151](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MG_151_cannon). Note the 20x82mm cartridge.

Now, the American planes had a modified [Hispano](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispano-Suiza_HS.404) cannon. Which has a 20x110mm cartridge.

It strikes me as odd that a nation would produce ammunition for the few examples of a foreign aircraft they captured. 

Surely, it'd make more sense to substitute/upgrade the armaments for ones which have ammunition readily available?

There's less issue with 7.** mm and 12.** mm guns because they were somewhat interchangeable - between Germany/UK/USA at least.

Sorry if this is completely random and ""too serious"", it's just been sitting in my head for a while now."	t5_2uc6j	True

1369028707.0	1eogbf	[HB] Why do Allied teams almost universally lack any sort of strategy or tactics, and why is Germany stacked in the queue 100% of the time (Not rage, actually discuss why this game is in gridlock).	SgtMustang	25	4	52	"Not even worried about the Dora, just about the state of the game in general. Allies lack any sort of really effective counter to anything Germany has, nothing we have climbs on the level of Germans, nothing has the level of easy-OHKO armament, we fall apart in one or two hits from a 190 cannon.

The only real decent plane is the Corsair D, and it's armament is relatively weak in comparison to the other factions (200 vs 1 bullet to kill), and even then I'm now getting routinely out turned by German fighters when I used to turn circles inside of them. 

-Besides, when a 190 or a 109 gets the jump on you (which is always) I've found it VERY hard, even with proper bounce countering techniques, to avoid ALL the bullets they shoot, usually they hit just one, and because they have a OHKO cannon, you end up being crippled and your whole agility advantage is nullified.

-Is it just me, or are German fighters far too strong, or are the Bomber guns far too weak? When I'm defending my tail with my Mitchell's brownings, even with the combined Tailgun+Dorsal turret Quad browning onslaught to the face, it generally takes 5 or more seconds of sustained fire (assuming all shots are contacting) to actually do any meaningful damage. In 99% of cases, the German finishes me off before my Quad brownings can scratch them (Yes I am contacting, it is not hard to hit a German fighter camping 300M behind your bomber).

My suggested fixes:

-Adjust matchmaker and limit planes based on factual numbers (I.e. little to no Dora presence as there were so few of them made in real life, majority should be 109s and 111s)

-Give allies # advantage, as this is how they won the war.

-Attacking team (Allies for all current HB maps) starts in the air already relatively close to target and high up, Germans have to scramble fighters in the air to intercept."	t5_2uc6j	True

1367417930.0	1dhctn	The grind, the endless grind...any solutions?	lptomtom	27	6	36	"I used to play WT daily and sing Gaijin's praise to all my friends...I even got 5 or 6 of them to start playing as well. Things started to get more complicated with 1.29, of course, and now they're all gone: they just didn't have enough free time to grind for hours on end until they reached the planes they loved (WW2 fans). One gave up before he reached his beloved 109G6, the other before the P51D, you get the idea. As for me, I'm playing one or two games a day, but I just don't enjoy it as much as before...and I probably won't even reach the planes I've fantasized about since I started playing (FW190's, Me262, Mustang, B17's...). 

Now, if there was a ""complete"" version of the game sold at a normal retail price (50-60€), I'd buy it in a heartbeat...buying eagles to advance, however, is extremely pricey (just look at the huge amounts of money spent by some players). 

Any other solutions? Is anyone else facing the same issue?"	t5_2uc6j	True

1366158975.0	1ci02l	Status update: welcome to our new co-moderator! Subreddit style overhaul now complete	NOACeulemans	26	6	9	"Hello again /r/warthunder!

As you've noticed from the looks of the page and the modpost I made about it earlier, we now have a different stylesheet. This is in large part thanks to the work of my friend /u/Muleo, who we've decided to promote to moderator of the subreddit. As a former Flight Model dev for the game and avid player of Historic Battles who's good with CSS, he's more than qualified to help out. So a big welcome to him!

Since the previous modpost, we've gone further and added two more features:

1. Working filters! Just select one of the filters from the FILTERS dropdown menu and it'll re-arrange your /r/warthunder experience. To turn off the filter, just click the Normal (all content) tab on the Filters menu. The current filters are:
      - Strictly Arcade (displays Arcade, untagged/miscellaneous posts, Modposts and News)
      - Strictly HB (displays HB, Modposts and News)
      - Strictly FRB (displays FRB, Modposts and News)
      - Casual Modes (displays everything but FRB)
      - Serious Modes (displays everything but A and Other)
      - News Only shows only News posts
      - Modposts Only shows only Modposts
      - Misc Posts Only shows only untagged and un-gamemode-specific content.

2. Link flair color coding! To even more easily sort content, posts will receive link flair based on what their content is. This relies on tags! If you have a question to ask and it relates closely to a gamemode, best tag it!

As you can see, this is always still slightly WIP. So if you experience any troubles in using the new /r/warthunder, or if you dislike something, do say so!

Now, what I would recommend you guys do is take all that energy you put in some great posts here, and direct that also towards some in-depth feedback to the Devs on the forums.

The more feedback they get the more likely change will happen. 
The game is still in beta and everything is up for grabs for the foreseeable future.

This is not to say that one shouldn't post criticism or thoughts on /r/Warthunder because some posts are really good discussion stepping stones.

But not following it up with a good feedback post on the WT forums is pretty much shouting at a storm.
So, please guys, Give that essential feedback to the devs!
