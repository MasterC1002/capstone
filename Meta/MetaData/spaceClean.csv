I'll be updating this page with a new watercolour every hour (despite being silly o'clock in the UK.)

I decided not to illustrate a technical or scientific perspective on the events of the next 10 hours. Instead, the illustrations here are an attempt to engender in you the same personal response that I have to this mission, which is best told through the story of a child. Allow me to explain:

As children, we playfully explore the dark world of the unknown, and it is the mystery that fuels our curiosity to learn and understand. Growing up, the darkness gradually fades, and the world is placed tamely within the reigns of science and reason. For me, exploring the world outside our own is like reigniting that mystery that we all once enjoyed as a part of growing up.

I've just bigged up these paintings far more than they can hope to fulfil, but I've worked very hard on them, and I'm proud of (most of) them. I hope you like them too:

Since seeing the interest expressed by redditors at [my AMA the other day](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14schr/i_am_astronaut_chris_hadfield_commander_of/), I've been thinking about how to keep everyone here involved in the mission.

Therefore, what I would like to do is get a feel for what types of photos (and to a lesser extent video) you'd like to see and try to oblige. The best suggestions, (and those that I am capable of) I'll be looking to upload to my [twitter](https://twitter.com/Cmdr_Hadfield) and [facebook](http://www.facebook.com/AstronautChrisHadfield) and hopefully my son can then post them here.

&gt;To: (lunar science listserv)
&gt;
&gt;Fellow Lunatics:
&gt;
&gt;First I owe you all an apology for my missive in response to the posting earlier today about the ""end to NASA's Planetary Science program"". I should have done my homework before responding!  I have now done my homework and want to share with you what I have found out.  I contacted Dan Britt, Chair of the DPS because he had a meeting with folks from OMB and OSTP on 26 October. He kindly shared with me what he reposted back to his committee and I reproduce below:
&gt;
&gt;""I met with Paul Shawcross and J.D. Kundu of OMB and Tamara Dickinson of OSTP yesterday (10/26/11) about the prospects for the planetary budget. While these are tough budget times it was clear that they are supporters of the planetary program and the priorities in the decadal survey. The rumors from the Robert Zubrin Commentary in the Washington Times that the “Obama administration intends to terminate NASA's planetary exploration program” were not supported by anything I heard at that meeting. What they are concerned about is the future direction of the Mars program. OMB believes moving forward with MAX-C commits NASA to multiple Mars flagship missions. My take-away was that even with ESA support the Mars sample return flagship is not going to be approved by OMB.
&gt;
&gt;What was also clear was that they are willing to support other priorities on the flagship list that don’t require multi-mission commitments.  What was important to me was that they support the decadal priorities in the order they were presented, i.e. Operating Missions, R&amp;A, Technology, Discovery, New Frontiers, then Flagships.  My impression was that OMB and OSTP are supportive of a healthy planetary program.""
&gt;
&gt;As far as I am concerned, this issue is resolved in terms of losing all NASA Planetary Science. Please do not send any more postings to the list about this.
&gt;
&gt;I reiterate that the Lunar-L is for lunar science exchange and request that all non-science postings be sent to me first for approval.
&gt;
&gt;Again, you have my apologies and many thanks for your patience.
&gt;
&gt;Your friendly Lunar-L administrator.

That means I'm the one sending commands to the spacecraft and ensuring that it is healthy.  Ask me anything you'd like and I will respond as much as I (legally) can.

EDIT:  I am not a scientist on the mission.  I can't be quoted for anything that I say about it because I only know what they told us in training :)

EDIT2: Thanks for all the questions!  I'll be right back... I have to command one of our other spacecraft

EDIT3: Thank you all again for some really great questions.  I'm leaving work now but I'll be back on later tonight (in a few hours) to answer more questions - 5:25PM MST.

EDIT4: Back to answering questions.  7:25PM MST.

EDIT5: I want to answer some general questions and misconceptions up here, so hopefully I can answer a broad depth of your questions in one fell swoop:

- Kepler is in an Earth-trailing Heliocentric orbit.  It is not in a halo or Lagrangian orbit. The orbital parameters of the spacecraft are very similar to Earth's but not quite (it is slightly more eccentric).  As a result, the spacecraft moves slower than the Earth does relative to the sun.  That is why it is drifting away from the Earth.
- We will lose contact with Kepler long before it goes behind the sun.  The telecomm subsystem is not designed for very low data rate transmission (like Voyager) and as a result, we wouldn't get any useful science if we were to drop to very low rates.
- Unfortunately, we can't strap on a giant dish because the time and cost to design, build, test, integrate, and launch a huge telecom subsystem is unrealistic.
- I have no more information on the planets than you guys do... we don't get to see the science.
- Kepler is looking at approximately 1x10^-16 percent of the visible stars in the universe.
- The best way to start work in this field is to get in on the ground level doing Mission Ops and working your way up from there.  These positions sometimes require a degree and some don't.
- The transit method can NOT detect planets which are not in the line of sight from Kepler to the star.

If you want your question answered please post it at the bottom... piggybacking off the top comments makes it hard for me to keep track of the ones I've responded to.  Thanks! :)

EDIT6: Holy crap, I think I'm caught up.  Time to get some food.  WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME, REDDIT?

EDIT7: Back :) 9:25PM MST.  Why are all of my time updates on the :25? Weirrrrd

EDIT8: I think I'm going to goto bed.  Thank you all so much for your questions.  People like you are what makes Kepler so important.  I'll be back in the morning to answer any other questions people have!

EDIT9: Back for a little bit... I have to get some research done though.  I'm also on shift for Kepler later so maybe I'll get to talk to it and have all of you be jealous :)

EDIT10: On console for Kepler now. Talk to you guys later! Thanks for a great AMA :) Sorry I couldn't answer more questions about the science.

1363267125.0	1aa6br	So, I saw the ISS this morning...	Hambone76	1542	497	209	"As I was leaving work, I got the alert on my phone for a visible pass only minutes away. Now, I've seen the space station a bunch of times. I know what it looks like and it doesn't change. It's a small white dot, moving quickly across the sky, easily mistaken for an aircraft. As I sat surrounded by people on their morning commute, I watched intently through my window as the ISS passed overhead. I wanted to run to the cars near me and scream ""Look up, that's the space station!"" But, alas, I knew they didn't care. They don't understand what that little white dot represents. They don't realize the potential, or the miracles of science that got it there. They just go on about their lives, worrying about deadlines and bills, and when little Billy has to be at soccer practice tonight and if they have time to buy the newest xbox game on the way there. I just couldn't grasp their apathy; at least no more than they could grasp my excitement over a little white dot. I was heartbroken.

So I did what any other American male would do. I raced the space station. 

That's right. I looked out my window and for a few seconds, I was not just some guy in a truck driving  down Wilmeth road at 45mph. Oh no. I was going 17,000mph, doing science at breakneck speed, trying not to get clobbered by micrometeorites or burned by radiation. For as long as I could keep them in my driver's window, I was one of them. And it was beautiful.

But all good things come to an end. A mere minutes later, the ISS disappeared into the rising sun, and my adventure was over. I continued on my way and will now sleep the contented slumber of a space voyager who has just returned home. So Godspeed Chris Hadfield and the crew of expedition 34. Remember as you orbit this pale blue dot that you are carrying not only the future on your shoulders, but also the past dreams of 36 year old aspiring astronauts who still live their lives vicariously through you. 

TL;DR - this morning I went all Top Gun and raced the ISS with my truck like Tom Cruise raced an F-14 with his motorcycle.

EDIT: This was in no way meant to sound condescending, as some people have accused. I have pointed it out to people in the past, and while some say ""I want to see,"" they are quickly disappointed when they realize it just looks like an airplane. Some people just flat out don't care, or look at me like I'm a complete nerd. Which I am. There's been very very few people who look and say ""wow, that's cool."" If more people would just slow down and take the time to appreciate what's going on around them, whether it be the ISS or just nature, we may as a nation and country become more invested in science education and things that are considered ""unnecessary"" like space funding. 

I also try to do the same thing with meteor showers, that gets a bit more of a positive response. At least for the first couple minutes. Then they usually get tired of waiting for the next one and go back inside."	t5_2qh87	True

His troublesome ride would buck and rattle and run loud for four minutes, then get much quieter for another ten, and then the engine would quit. Odd behavior for any vehicle but the Space Shuttle, as Click and Clack eventually realized, and a memorable exploit for Grunsfeld’s second Shuttle mission.

**UPDATE 5 (Aug. 10-11:26AM CST)- Take a look at [this image](http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/675630main_pia16031b-43_full.jpg) and see where Curiosity is currently and note that they are interested in testing the following quads: 120/121/134/135. Each quad is approximately 1 square mile. Curiosity is currently in quad 51 - highlighted.**

**UPDATE 4 (Aug. 10-10:34AM CST)- After listening to the latest SOL update, it sounds as though we will only have a few more full res images coming in today and tomorrow. After that it could be up to 5-7 days before we receive another image. They are currently updating the software from the flight software to the driving software. Due to the uplink/downlink rate this is going to take some time to insure it does not go wrong or corrupt the computer and ruin the entire mission.**

I have moved Images 1-88 to [this imgur](http://imgur.com/a/n6AOG#0) album to allow more room for new photos.

**Check out the new video/image collection link at the bottom. NASA server has been up and down all day.**

I have left a few links for the videos and websites that were not images.

**Thanks to everyone who has contributed or given tips.**

I will be updating this consistently with new pictures from the MSL/Curiosity rover. I have been keeping up to date every minute with new pictures and videos.

I will do my best to weed out the fakes, but please feel free to correct me if I am wrong.

They estimate they were about 660 feet off of the targeted landing location. So look at it like this: This craft traveled approximately 150 million miles, over 36 weeks, landed within 1 minute after the estimated landing time from months before, 6/10 of a second of the estimated landing time 3 weeks before, was traveling 13,700MPH when it entered Mars Atmosphere and landed only 660 feet off of target. OH. MY. ~~GOD.~~ SCIENCE. 

Timestamps are from when I post edits. Hope everyone enjoys as much as I do.

1313851527.0	jov5g	Stephen Colbert got the wrong nut!	tomsing98	1082	386	100	"At around 19:50 of the video, the STS-135 crew gives Stephen Colbert a frangible nut, 8 of which are used to hold the Space Shuttle to the launch pad.

http://www.hulu.com/watch/268861/the-colbert-report-tue-aug-16-2011

The thing is, I did the structural analysis of frangible nut redesign back in 2007-2008, and this is the old design.  The new one has a very distinct groove about a quarter of an inch wide running around the top edge of the nut, where they install a pyrotechnic link as a backup for the independent electrical systems that fire the charges on either side.  Here's a comparison.  http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/pdf/290339main_8-388221J.pdf

Unless NASA went back to the old design for some reason (I don't work there anymore, but I'm asking some of my old colleagues), Stephen Colbert does not have a frangible nut from STS-135.

It's still cool that my nuts are on TV, though!

**Edit:** I'm told the Hulu link doesn't work outside the US.  I apologize for that, but not for giving measurements in pounds and inches.  Anyway, this link might work better: http://www.colbertnation.com/full-episodes/tue-august-16-2011-crew-of-sts-135  Still at 19:50.  It was a little sketchy earlier today, but it seems to be working now.

**Edit:** Still waiting to hear from folks about whether NASA used the old style nuts for some reason on 135.  Weekends.  In the meantime, here's a screen capture that shows the lack of the crossover modification.  http://www.flickr.com/photos/9769046@N03/6065200851/  In Stephen's lower hand, there should be a groove about a quarter inch wide running around the the nut about 3/4 in from the top end (toward the camera).  In his upper hand, you'd be able to see daylight about where the small threads are, just above his index finger.

**Edit:** I heard back this morning from the manager of the SRB mechanical design group at USA, and he tells me that none of the frangible nuts used on STS-135 have been released from post-flight inspection, and that they're all the crossover nut design.  A photo from post-flight: http://www.flickr.com/photos/9769046@N03/6069060655/  That shows the crossover groove very clearly."	t5_2qh87	True

1341886982.0	wb0u8	There are approximately 200 to 400 billion stars in the Milky Way. How many is that?	nrj	930	265	239	"I learned this fact just a while ago, but I find that numbers that big don't have any real meaning to me. So, here's my attempt at putting it into perspective: 

Let's say that you really enjoy naming stars and you're really good at it, so you've decided to name all of the stars in the Milky Way and you can name them at a rate of one per second. Using the average of 300 billion, how long would that take you?

Well, 300 billion seconds, obviously, but that's not helpful. 5 billion minutes? Not much better. 83 million hours? No. 3.5 million days? Getting closer. 9,506 years— there we are!

9,500 years— still an almost unfathomable length of time for a organism who might live 100 years if he is very lucky, but fortunately our collective intelligence allows us some grasp of this number. 9,500 years before today was 7500 B.C.E. The Neolithic Revolution was becoming widespread in China. As a species, we were still some 2000 to 4000 years from the invention of writing. The Great Pyramid of Giza was built farther from this date than from the present. If you started to name the stars of the Milky Way at this time and continued uninterrupted at the rate of one per second, you would have just now finished your task.

And perhaps you wrote all of the names down as you made them— how long would the list be? I'll spare you the calculations this time, but using a 12-point font set solid with one name per line, the list would be just under 790,000 miles long. You could wrap this list around the Earth's equator 31.7 times. It would reach from the Earth to the Moon 3.2 times.

And now consider that that's just one galaxy of perhaps 80 billion.

Space is awesome.

Edit: Added ""font"" which was missing, but I think most people figured it out. Thanks for the amazing response, everyone! I'd like to give special thanks to Richard Feynman and Carl Sagan (no, seriously!), who inspired this post through *What Do You Care What Other People Think?* and *Cosmos*, respectively."	t5_2qh87	True
