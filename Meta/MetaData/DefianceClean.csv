before I start, here's a little bit about myself (so things make sense).  I run a Planetside 2 community and within it, is a Trion employee.  This employee and I have been playing together for a few months now and upon hearing he had been working on Defiance, I quickly purchased it.  

I wanted to thank you all for your passion and hard work when it comes to Defiance, I bought the game to support my friend, and honestly was not expecting much.  However, you all blew my socks off and can't wait to see the future of the game.  I appreciate the 18 hour work days you all put in, I appreciate the time you put into the community, I appreciate everything you guys do and I'm sure all of us here in this subreddit feel the same.

So again, 
a big thank you, keep it up guys"	t5_2siko	True

1365511236.0	1bzhpj	So you want to mod your gun? Welcome to modding 101	ThatFacelessMan	121	18	56	"The modding process is essential to effective weapon use. With mods a decent gun can be good, a good gun can be great, and a great gun makes you an ark hunter to be reckoned with.

That being said, modding a weapon can be a confusing and troublesome process. First you'll need a few things to get started. A weapon, a mod, and at least 100 EGO rating. Access to the Salvage Matrix is unlocked prior to 100 ER, but at 100 ER you should be able to start adding additional mod slots to weapons. 

First let's start with where the salvage matrix is:
[Right here](http://i.imgur.com/dwAtalV)

There is no hotkey to immediately take you to it, so going through the Loadout menu is the quickest, and will also help keep you mindful of what you have equipped, as that can make a difference to your modding experience, but we'll cover that in a minute.

Welcome to the [Salvage Matrix!](http://i.imgur.com/Zy7L0q7)

In it you select a weapon, and depending on the weapon and your EGO rating you have several options. First is to break the weapon down for resources. This gives you an amount of ark salvage depending on the rarity of the item.

In order:

White - 250

Green - 500

Blue - 750

Purple - 1000

Orange - 1250

You should be doing this with almost any weapon, grenade, or shield that you don't want. Modding weapons can deplete your ark salvage quickly if you're not careful, and an ark hunter flush with ark salvage can buy keycodes at lockboxes, and potentially get even better guns to work with! 

So now you've got a gun, and you want to put a snazzy new mod on it. Awesome! This is what it looks like when you've got a un-modded gun selected, and ready to go. 

[Looking good!](http://i.imgur.com/bEsotL4)

But you realize that maybe you don't really want to mod that pistol. You're going to scrap it, and get some salvage. What you really want to do is put another mod on that awesome Infector that absolutely destroyed those pesky 99er's. You already put a barrel on it to increase it's damage, but it needs a better scope for accuracy. 

[Oooooh, check out that DoT!](http://i.imgur.com/mB3D5QC)

So you can see what a gun with a mod already attached looks like. See how the icon for barrel is lit up, and has the mod stats next to it?

Well lets load that bad boy into the salvage matrix!

[Uh oh](http://i.imgur.com/vvCWgql)

Whoops! That's right, if your weapon is equipped you can't perform any action to it. So make sure you check all your loadouts before you try to mod something. 

There we go! [Much better](http://i.imgur.com/2Hl58io)

Notice that there are now options to remove or retrieve the mods currently equipped on the weapon. Removing the mods destroys all mods that are attached to the weapon, clearing the slots. Recovering the mods destroys the weapon, but you get the mods back. 

I mentioned that cost was a factor previously. To simply attach a mod, there is no cost, however everything after that costs ark salvage and time.

[Remove mod: 285 ark scrap, 5 minutes](http://i.imgur.com/PYqw6yQ)

[Retrieve mod: 5,690 ark scrap, 2 minutes](http://i.imgur.com/Gvax9TJ)

[Add mod slot: 11,380 ark scrap, 10 minutes](http://i.imgur.com/5Ot6hRI)

The cost for each weapon is dependant on it's EGO rating. The lower it is, the lower the cost. The higher it is, the higher the cost. A 1000 ER green is going to be much more expensive than a 180 ER purple. That being said, for each mod slot you add, the cost doubles. It does not look like removing or retrieving goes up in price with repetition, so those costs are totally dependant on the ER of the weapon.

So yeah, the costs add up, so breakdown those worthless pieces of gear cluttering your inventory all the time!

So that's how you navigate the salvage matrix. But what about the actual mods? There are four mod slots, and four mod types. Stock, barrel, magazine, and scope. They follow the same color scheme for rarity, but also have the additional marker of being named with a roman numeral, I-V to denote their rarity level as well. 

There's a breakdown of all the types and their in game names here: http://www.ign.com/wikis/defiance/Modifications

You get mods from side quests, arkfalls, hotshots, and rampages. They are also available from some vendors on sale, but there are a few vendors that deal exclusively in mods, such as Iron Demon Ranch, Headlands Transport and Cronkhite Station, and the faction vendors of Toolworks, VBI, Soleptor, and Echelon have a random mod from a synergy set for sale.

A synergy set? Yep, there are even more bonuses to be had with some mods and weapons, and this is where it gets really fun.

Synergy sets are a set of bonuses that all have something in common, they are on weapons and mods, and the more of synergy mods you have of the set on a synergy weapon of the same type, the more bonuses from the set appear.

Let's take a look!

Here's my [baby](http://i.imgur.com/dgXM5ni)

She's a faction Frontier SAW from Toolworks, and she's got it where it counts. For each synergy mod you attach, you unlock one of those bonuses. Synergy mods are just like weapons, in that they can have their own stats as well. So an Extended Magazine III mod would have a x1.5 magazine, and could have any synergy set on it as well, so you're getting double the bonuses when using synergies. 

As you can see Prepared deals with ammo regeneration, and increased melee damage on a kill, so Prepared would be good for weapons that need ammo, or for builds looking for increased melee damage, like Blur!

So what are the other synergies, and where are they available? Well right now you can get synergy weapons at faction vendors. The three main, Toolworks, VBI, and Soleptor all have two types available, and Paradise and Echelon each have one. They're on purple or higher weapons, and it's also possible to find them, very rarely out in the world or through lock boxes. The odds of you finding a synergy weapon increases as your ER increases. 

You can also buy synergy mods from the faction vendors, and you'll get a random mod with that synergy on it. Generally they seem to be Blue, but I've gotten some Green as well. The Random Synergy Mod at the lockbox is in my opinion broken right now. It spits out Brutal Synergy mods almost 100% of the time. Apparently though it's working as intended right now. I have also found Nano-effect mods in the Random Synergy Mod. They are magazine mods that add a nano-effect to the weapon and have no other stat bonus. 

So what are the synergies?

There are more synergies out there, but I haven't taken pictures of them yet.

So that's about it for mods, modding, synergies, and the salvage matrix. If you've got any questions regarding mods, fire away!

Edit: fixed pictures, few errors, and typos, added clarification, and note about additional synergies.

Edit 5: Added 6 new synergies, and cost for modding info

1367346114.0	1dfcj2	Say NO to the Auction House. Say YES to the Wanted Board.	vbl	123	28	86	"The auction house is a bad idea. By providing a seller's marketplace, you're assured an oversupply of weaponry, increases in farming activity and an overall ""gaming"" of the system to maximize profits. It will also kill your personal looting activities.

For example, Borderlands wouldn't be much of a shoot-n-loot game if you could just buy the very best weapons available whenever you want. Why shoot? Why loot? Same goes for Defiance.

What should be considered - and what dovetails nicely with the game's vibe - is a Wanted board.

The Wanted board is a buyer's marketplace where people in search of certain things can post requests, and bounties, for items. Other players can then respond to these requests with the item in question (provided it qualifies) and receive the (scrip, salvage or keycodes) bounty. Close call offers can also be made. 

For gameplay, it may mean choosing a high price bounty and actively searching for that item, or just comparing your loot against the list of requests.

In either case, if well-designed, it's a more balanced approach to asynchronous player-to-player commerce. "	t5_2siko	True

1366401440.0	1cp1nd	Comprehensive Suggestion List	ManaPot	108	17	43	"Here is a list of ideas that I think should be added / fixed in Defiance.

Post on the official forums: http://forums.defiance.com/showthread.php?44223-Comprehensive-Suggestion-List

* **Whisper button** - Add a button in the friends list and clan list that you can click to initiate a whisper to that person. A lot of people have oddly named characters and it makes it hard to keep typing their name over and over when you have multiple conversations going on.

* **Replying to a whisper** - When you type */r* have it automatically fill in that person's name (Replying to Bob would change */r* to */w Bob*). This way if somebody else whispers you while you are typing a message, you don't have to stop and delete it to type in the person's name. I find it really annoying that I'll type up a huge response and hit enter, only to find that someone else whispered me and the message went to them instead.

* **Toggle chat** - Make it so you can toggle that chat to stay up permanently (not fade out). I miss a lot of messages due to how quickly they disappear off the screen. I know that I can scroll up, but I don't always have the time, and it gets tiresome having to do it all of the time.

* **Resize chat** - Having the ability to resize chat would be nice too. I play on PC at 1920x1080, and the box seems too small.

* **Get rid of the salvage screen** - It is un-needed and makes things take longer than needed. Move it all to the inventory screen and add the buttons there. When you click on an item name, have the options appear there (Breakdown, Add Mods, Add Mod Slot, Remove Mods, etc). The inventory screen is basically useless as it is right now, I never go to it.

* **Quick Menu -&gt; Remove Friend** - Get rid of this. I can't tell you have many times I've accidentally removed friends while using the quick menu. It's not needed here, you can open your friends list and remove them from there if you need to.

* **Friends list** - Sort the friends list in alphabetical order. The OCD side of me goes crazy when looking for someone. Online in ABC order, then offline in ABC order.

* **Clan list** - Make it so online clan members are at the top of the list, in alphabetical order. Then offline members at the bottom, in alphabetical order.

* **Empty Loadout** - Give us the option to click a button and empty an entire loadout. It's really annoying not being able to attach mods or salvage / vendor items because it's equiped on a loadout I never use. I use my main loadout 95% of the time, I don't even really need the rest of them. And the fact that you can't remove items at all, is quite annoying.

* **Banks / storage** - Give us access to a storage locker. Even if they share the same inventory space, let me move them off of my person so I don't have to look at it. I have some things that I want to keep, but I don't exactly want to carry around with me all of the time. It just makes the salvage screen more cluttered, having to take time and navigate through things.

* **Map -&gt; Teleport Group** - Allow me to double-click a group member on the map and teleport to them like Fast Travel does. I often look at where my other group members are, and want to teleport to them. But I then have to close out of the map and go through the menu to get to them. Remove the un-needed steps and let me just do it from the map.

* **Map -&gt; Waypoints** - Let my group members see my waypoints. This would help when trying to tell them where to go. Each person's waypoint is a different color and when you mouse-over it, it says who's it is.  Or even if you want to keep it simple, only the leader's waypoint is visible to everybody else in the group.

* **Store -&gt; Lockboxes** - Adjust the cost of lockboxes from the Defiance Store. Nobody is going to pay $1.50 (T2 lockbox) for 2 green items they're just going to salvage. I'm not asking to make it ""pay to win"", but at least make it worth the money. I don't plan on buying these, since I don't have money to blow. But it just seems like something that needs to be fixed.

* **Remove a single mod** - Why can't I just remove one mod from my gun? I don't want to remove all four of them when I need to upgrade a single mod. Let me remove one at a time if I want, even if it costs a higher fee.

* **Character customization** - A LOT of us had no idea we could customize our characters so much. The options are hard to notice at the moment. Put a ""barber shop"" type feature in the game where we can pay Scrip to change our character's appearance.

* **Different vehicles** - Some new vehicles would be nice. We basically have 4 different looks at the moment. I'm not asking for different vehicle types, just make them look different. They are all re-skins of what we already have. Let me get a badass Challenger with guns mounted on it (pure looks, non-functional). If you create really rare vehicles that look awesome (not just re-colored), people will work for / buy them.

* **Vehicles -&gt; Reverse** - If you quickly tap ""D"" (on PC) to go in reverse, your vehicle will just keep going and going and going until it runs into something. Why doesn't it slow down and stop like when going forward?

* **Fullscreen windowed mode** - Please.

* **Nameplates** - Allow me to set it so the nameplates are always shown. At the moment, you have to target the person to see their name. Let me turn them on so it is always shown above their head.

* **Clan -&gt; Founder** - Add a confirmation box when promoting somebody to the clan founder. I wanted to see how many ranks there are in the clan, and ended up promoting my friend to the founder. I can see this being problematic if somebody accidentally does it to someone they don't know so well, and the other person refuses to give it back. We don't need confirmation on all promotions, just when promoting someone to founder.

* **More people per server** - Increase the amount of people on each server. I know that each game platform is one giant server, but then there are ""phasing servers"" which limit the amount of people seen in the game world. Increase the number from whatever it is at the moment so we can actually run into other people while playing. The only time I see people is the 2-3 standing around vendors at each town.

* **Ending perks** - Why is this even an option? Sometimes I double-click 1 on accident, which starts my perk then removes it. Welp, that was fun. Time to wait 40 seconds for it to come back up... Who would ever want to prematurely end their perk? I don't see why this is even an option...

* **""Lock"" items** - Have the ability to lock items so they aren't able to be sold or salvaged. - Credit: /u/verugan

* **Healing** - Get rid of that screen effect when somebody is healing you. This is **very** disruptive in PvP. I'm constantly thinking I'm getting shot at, and it messes with your vision. Why am I being punished for a teammate healing me?!?

* **Breakable objects** - For the love of God, make some of the stuff out in the world breakable. It's annoying running into a 3 inch tall rock and having my vehicle stop. Or clipping the edge of a fence and stopping. Or running into a 1/2 inch thick pole and stopping. I think you get the idea.

* **Offline invites** - Let us send friend requests and clan invites when the other player is offline.

* **Rename character** - Be able to purchase a character name change through the Defiance Store for $5 worth of Bits.

* **Colorblind support** - Help out our friends who have trouble seeing the color-specific stuff in the game. - Credit: /u/sourceoritsbullshit

* **Quicker chat** - Make it so when you type */* it opens the chat up. That way I can just type */clan* and start typing without having to hit enter every time."	t5_2siko	True

Of course asking the guy how he did it always resulted in ""I'm pro"", but doing my own research I came across this guide on Steam:
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=136738681#45613
and this post on MMOCatacombs:
http://mmo.catacombs.com/showthread.php/2552-Defiance-Hacking-Trion-is-alleged-to-be-stupid-and-it-might-be-true

Pretty scary stuff, and true enough when I joined a Shadow War, I was shot and killed by a homing Infector dart, and this was after the Infector nerf. Checking the guys stats, he went 46-2. 

No idea what Trion was thinking when they made weapon damage client side with no checks in place to prevent this from happening. 

Just FYI - if you are getting utterly destroyed in PvP or found someone one shot killing mobs in an Arkfall, you should probably report them.

EDIT: I in no way discovered this. I simply brought it to Reddit to discuss with my fellow Ark Hunters.

I also want to give a special thanks to Sledgehammer70 for responding and really driving home that people doing this will be banned, as well as dispelling some myths about Defiance not having any way to detect the hackers.

So I've been playing since just after launch, and I've decided to cobble together a condensed list of FAQ's to help new players out. Most, if not all of this information (and then some) can be found on the wiki, so be sure to check it out! Play the tutorial before reading, this is extra information that they fail to mention. I'm playing on the 360, so some information may be a little different. This post if far from comprehensive but it's all I can come up with right now, feel free to suggest additions, and I'll edit the post to include them. Also, up vote for visibility please!

Q: Does the race/background I pick matter?

A: Very minimally. As far as I know, it only changes your starting costume and weapon. You will find more weapons almost immediately.

Q: What are bits?

A: Bits are the in game cash shop currency. They are basically equivalent to Microsoft Points. Most of the cash shop items are cosmetic only, and really have no effect on the game. Lockboxes are the exception as they contain random weapons and mods. I also highly recommend shelling out some money to increase your inventory slots, they fill up quick.

Q: So, I should buy a bunch of tier 1 lock boxes because they're cheap, right?

A: If you're just starting out, maybe one or two, but generally no. The developers have told us that Tier 4 boxes have much better high level and rarity weaponry. (At the time of writing, Oranges seem to be dropping more frequently from level 3 boxes, however.)

Q: Weapon rarity? 

A: The names of weapons are in various different colors. The order, in increasing rarity, is as follows: White, Green, Blue, Purple, Orange. 

Q: Ok, so I have some rare-ish guns now. I should do pvp to show of my skillzors, yeah?

A: Absolutely not. I don't recommend entering pvp until your Ego level is at least 200.

Q: What is the difference between minor and major Ark Falls?

A: The biggest difference is the difficulty involved. In a major ark fall, several smaller battles must be completed before the ""final boss"" of the AF. The difficulty of the enemies you encounter ramps up for each player in the area, and big AF's tend to attract 100+ players. The rewards are slightly better for a major AF but in the beginning, it's best to stick to the minor ones. I recommend waiting until you have at least 100 ego before entering your first major fall. Any less and you'll probably just be in the way.

Q: How do self revives work? 

A: There is a small icon on your hud of a man in a grey box. This is your self revive timer, when it is full, you can self revive again. Some weapons have effects which help restore this timer.

Q: So I'm fighting some hell bugs and then OHGODIMONFIREITBURNSAHHHHHH!

A: Not quite a question there, rookie. But you'll want to roll that off. This also helps break those mud cocoon things the archers/pods fire at you.

Other things:

Vendors are your friend! Always check back to see what the new deals and sales are. I've gotten some of my best middle tier gear that way.

When participating in Ark Falls, try to know where the closest ammo box is. It may be up the road, but the vehicles are fast. You will almost always run out of ammo at least once during an Ark Fall, so don't be that guy who tries to melee the crystal.

Gear that drops is different for every player, and no one can pick up what you see, so don't risk going down for a crappy grenade mod. It will be there when the skitters are gone.

Boost is A on the Xbox, Shift on the PC and X on the PS3.

Now get out there and make some scrip!



Edit: Here is some added information provided by your fellow Ark Hunters!

""You can unlock all four of the powers but can only equip one at a time. This also gives you access to perks that you wouldn't normally have access to. (Assuming you steer clear of ""Increases your (Individual power such as cloak) by X amount perks.)
For example you can pick Increase item drop by 3% if enemy is killed by an explosive, as long as you unlock the top right power, then unlock the perk. And despite not having that power in use, you can still use the perk if you have it equipped."" - TimeLordPony


""There are Co-op missions that are instanced like other MMOs. You have to go through a queue to get to them.
Command for the 360, off the top of my head:
Dpad Left: Quick Menu
Matchmaking
Coop Mission
It should list all the available Coop missions that you have as well as Quick Join. If you don't see any there, do some missions and level up, Coop Missions open up as you progress."" - Desdomen


(On items not appearing if inventory is full) ""If you go to the store tab, all items that wont fit in the backpack go down to the bottom in a claim items section... you can get them there.
I learned this from defeating instances and Items disappearing only to end up there!"" - Alexiib


Shameless Edit: Got linked in the sidebar. Sweeeeeeeeeeeeet. :]

If you would like to join, head to /r/Defiance and look for the application post.

I have also setup a subreddit for the clan over at **/r/rDefiance** where we'll be having clan discussions and all of that fun stuff. Once you are invited to the clan in-game, I would suggest subscribing over there.

These are for US servers by the way. Sorry EU. =(

end. (Unlike arkfalls).

You'll notice some changes over the next week or so, and one of the things I'm going to be adding is flair.

I'll be handing out some special ""VIP flair"" to some of the top contributors of this sub-reddit. I haven't paid attention to names that much while skimming through here, so I'm not really sure who all would deserve it. So I'm going to let you guys decide. I'll be keeping my eye out for users who I think deserve it in the future, but for now, I'll let you choose a few.

* Please upvote for visibility.

--------------------

I'll be choosing the ""winners"" within the next day or two. Again, I'll be watching more carefully and handing out the flair when I see fit. Just because you don't get picked now, doesn't mean you won't ever get picked. Just keep posting helpful and informative posts.

I've played all sorts of genres and subgenres of games from FPS to side-scrollers. But there was always something missing from every game I played. Usually not Something wrong with the game itself but I'd only be able to play it for so long and then I'd dump it. World of Warcraft for three years took it's toll... eventually I just wandered from game to game hunting for that one that would appease my damn near infinite hunger for variety in battle...

You have succeeded in saving this gamer! Defiance has given me the thing I desire... battle which isn't simple throwing skills at a target and a host of friends to fight alongside. The only other game that gave me this feeling was Hellgate: London... which sadly died. You've taken the genre I saw from them... and much improved on it! 

I see posts constantly complaining of bugs and issues. Few people have taken the time to appreciate what you've done so far. Know at least one gamer out there has seen your potential... and eagerly awaits your future content in Defiance. 

Thank you for everything you've done so far and for the awesome times now and in the future!

But I gave it a chance hoping something good would come of it...

I'm up to episode 5 (or 6 depending on how you look at it) and I'm really starting to love it. The character development is really good and I want to see these characters go somewhere.

My concern is that it has, so far, been very episodic... granted it's only 5 episodes in and perhaps I'm jumping the gun, but the average Star Trek series would be cancelled by now and then limp along trying to write new episodes while always having the ""okay we're done"" last episode in mind. If it weren't for the game tie in for this show... who knows.

I'd like to see the long arc start developing in this show sooner than later. These characters need to be going somewhere not just dealing with the next problem to come along and be done with it by the end of  every episode.

This is evident by an EXP bar below the Mod slots on every weapon. As the weapon's EXP bar fills, you also gain EXP towards the Weapon Skill.

However, each individual weapon can only rank up once. After you fill the bar, you gain no more EXP for either the weapon **or** the weapon skill. Because of this, you'll need to constantly switch weapons that you use.

For instance, I'm focusing on LMGs. I buy the Frontier SAW outside Happy Pow Ranch and level it up. Once filled, I sell it and purchase another one. Each weapon gains exp and levels and I gain Weapon Skill levels.

-----

EDIT: Adding bits of information as they're coming out in the comments. *Italicized could use further testing*

- The amount of Weapon EXP gained is based off the amount of regular EXP gained. Which is, in turn, based on the amount of damage you dealt.
- *In group situations (Arkfalls, Coop Missions, PvP), you gain Weapon EXP if you dealt the killing blow*
- The Ego rating of a weapon affects the strength of the bonus you gain when you rank a weapon.
- Specific to the BMG, you gain Weapon EXP for healing **IF** you restored shields or health.
- *Needs Testing: Does the damage a party member deal give you Weapon EXP if you are linking to them with a BMG?*
- Melee attacks do not give Weapon EXP."	t5_2siko	True
1373488768.0	1i16nu	Theory: Why there is no such thing as space magic and why Nolan...	angeleus09	48	14	49	"... never died.

I already laid these thoughts out in [a comment in the Episode 12 discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/Defiance/comments/1hwdmp/episode_12_discussion_everything_is_broken/cazt0la) but wanted to start a separate discussion on this specific issue here.

**1.) There is not, and never has been an Irathient god on Earth.** 

* It is the AI of the hidden ship appearing to her in a way that she can relate to. It did the same thing with Quentin McCawley by appearing as his brother, Luke when he held the key.

* We know Irisa has been carrying a key for years, so if we accept this premise regarding the AI then it stands to reason that it has also been this AI feeding her her visions throughout the years. To what end?

* Going back to Episode 8 when Quentin decided to give the key to Nikki so that she would tell him where his mother was, the AI, as Luke, told him not to give it up. This would indicate that it knew Nikki was looking for it and was actively trying to prevent that. Why?

* The only other person to hold a key was Doc Yewell, and the AI never manifested itself to her which we could take to mean that it did not want to talk to her at all. In fact, it appeared as the Irathient girl to Irissa to try and show her the location of the other key, presumably so she could take it from the Doc. Why?

At this point I'm assuming that the AI is self-aware since it seems to be able to choose who to appear or not appear to. To our knowledge, the Indogenes are the most technologically advanced race, so we would assume that they were also the architects of the hidden ship. The question then becomes: Why would the AI be actively trying to prevent itself from being discovered by it's creators? Is it so self-aware that it has developed a conscience? Or was it never an Indogene ship to begin with?

So what exactly is Irisa's real role in all of this?

Since the AI can manifest itself to people who carry the keys, we can guess that it manipulated the actions of the cult that placed the key in Irissa. It is entirely possible that the cult came into existence because of the members' interaction with the key and the AI manifesting itself as Irzu in order to use them to accomplish it's goals. 

However since we know the ship is old, we can assume the keys are just as old and that it's possible the AI has been manipulating people in the form of directing a cult even before the Votans arrived at our solar system.

However it came into being, we can assume that the cult sought out Irissa to place the key in her at the AI's direction, so now we have to ask if the AI was looking for Irissa specifically or just an Irathient girl around Irissa's age and she drew the short straw? Even if it was looking for Irissa specifically (which is perhaps the more interesting question) we're still left wondering what the significance of the Irathient race to the AI is.

**2.) Nolan was never dead, so he never needed to be magitechally resurrected.**

* If the AI can make Irisa see it as a whole other person, it can certainly make it seem as if a person who is injured has actually died and this is exactly what it did with Nolan.

* With Nolan alive, Irisa has no need to find the ship and can leave, but the AI clearly wants her to find it. By making Nolan appear dead, she now has motivation to seek it out in order ""sacrifice herself.""

* We only see him shot in the right shoulder which would wound and possibly cause him to pass out from blood loss. The AI adds a bit of glamour, knowing full well he will be OK in a bit anyway, and manipulates Irissa into thinking she has to find the ship in order to save him. (My original thought was that Nolan being shot to begin with was the AI at work to incapacitate him but /u/sg1jacksonsg1 provided this simpler scenario, which I like.) 

**TL; DR** ""Irzu"" and the Luke McCawley ""ghost"" were projections of the AI in the hidden ship. Nolan was never dead, just wounded, and the AI made Irissa see him as dead so that she would bring the keys to it to ""save"" Nolan."	t5_2siko	True

1365384769.0	1bw0nq	Guide To ''Factions'' and how ''Reputation'' works. I will Update as we figure out more.	Madwac	33	6	20	"Alright so please be kind, the servers are currently down and I cannot currently double check everything I will type with my own character. I will, however, edit it when I can. Please remind this while reading faction names/numbers everything is currently typed out of memory.

So here it goes. Note that I am currently a 750ish Ego player, so I think I can give some decent advice about the game with my experience this far.

**Factions in Defiance and how they work.**

There seems to be 5 ''factions'' right now in the game.

* 1 which is PVP related ''Echelon''
* 1 which is related to the coop Maps you complete ''Paradise Territory''
* The 3 left are ''world'' factions  ''Von Bach Industries'', ''Soleptors Entreprises'' and ''Top-Notch Toolworks''.

&gt; That's cool but how do I earn Reputation with said factions?

Well, the way the reputation system currently works (as per my understanding) is that you have to complete certain objectives listed as ''contracts''. There are two types of contracts for most factions:

* One that is quickly do-able and changes every 24 hours. Example: get x number of y from z mobs at w location, every mob you will kill at said location will give you one of the X and you usualy need 20. Even kills done by other players near you (even out of a group) will land you an objective so they usually complete very fast. **Theses contracts, while easy to complete, seem to only provide 10ish rep points for said faction** (number to verify)
* The other type of contract is a bit harder to complete, usually involves Killing a CERTAIN type of enemy (more often than not hard ones like bulwarks for dark matter) in a secluded location ( San Fransisco island for example). The trick here is not only finding the mobs, but also on the right patch of land and you need A LOT MORE (75ish). This type of contract seems to stay available for a few days (between 3-7) and land a lot more Rep points (I haven't fully done one because they changed mid week after launch so I'll need to add a number later)

&gt; That's awesome! but I cannot find for the life of me the Contract list that you speak of! where is it?

The contract list can be found next to the ''pursuits'' list. Default key to access the Pursuit list is ''J'' on PC. Once you are there click on the ''contracts'' list right next to it. If you cannot see them yet, **IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT EGO 250 YET. Contracts require you to be ego 250 before you can start doing them.**

&gt;So now that I got Reputation with factions what do I do with it? and does it stop when the line completes?

* You use said Rep to buy certain items at the faction's ''HQ'' they all have their own vendors on special spots on the map. The way it works is you will see the script cost of a weapon and next to it the emblem of the faction with a number, the number is the minimum rep required to buy said weapon.
* No, like in most MMOs the bar, once filled, will change you status with said faction (example for the 1st time it goes from ''unknown to Familiar''). And you can keep on earning rep. What are the benefits of maxing a Reputation? I don't know yet, the game has been out for less than a week and I have school/work give me a break ;).

&gt;But Why would I even want to buy Faction related items?

For a few reasons.

* They are adequately priced.
* They have great starting stats
* But mostly because they give out ''synergy bonuses'' which can be seen before buying them. These bonuses stacks with the mod synergy bonuses (as per my understanding) making your guns truly stand out from normal drops.
* Also, some have a starting bonus, for example; +2 mag for a gun before you even ''level it'' or mod it.

*Important to note*

* It seems that once you complete the objectives of a contract, you get your reputation and that's it. You have to wait for the timer to reach 0 (next 24 hours for smaller contracts) to get a new one. So it seems you can only get so much ''reputation farm'' per day. Let's say you complete both contracts for X faction, you have to wait till the next day before you can get a new small contract and to whatever time the ''big'' contract was gonna end at to get a new one of this one as well.
* The ''coop faction'' (name: Paradise Territory) only gives you contracts to complete a coop mission, it changes daylie. Just do it :P

* The ''PVP faction'' (name: Echelon) only gives contracts that seem to be do-able in shadow wars, I haven't pvped much yet so I cannot elaborate on this faction.



EDIT: apparently when they do server restarts the contracts tend to change and restart so it's either a good thing (if you wanna farm lots of small quick ones) or a bad thing (if you were working on a tough long one :( )

Alright I hope this was helpful, keep in mind that I will update this in time, correct the mistakes, change the numbers and names to correct ones when I can verify them. Also, be kind english is only my 2nd language ;) 

Happy hunting fellow Ark scavengers !

Now I'm not damning IGN, there views actually quite often match my own.

The article in question is titled ""Defiance, plot holes, goofs, and Easter eggs""
Now as a man who is almost 30 and something of life time Science Fiction fan let me tell you, there is nothing wrong with defiance!
One part of the article explains how stupid it is that on the first episode (SPOILERS) the reactor for the defence grid is on the outside of the defence grid.
I mean of course that is more than enough reason to not watch it right?
I mean if that where the case Star Wars could be considered the biggest Goof of science fiction history with ""this huge Death Star can only be destroyed by this very open small hole""

Now in the past, you could get several keys just for a 1-2 minutes of work.  I guess this was considered overpowered, so instead of reducing the keys to 1, they were eliminated completely. 

With these changes, there is very little incentive to complete these emergencies, which is too bad because they played a big part in making the game seem more alive.  It also makes lockboxes much more difficult to obtain.  Personally I don't really see myself grinding out the keys in co-op with the way the drop rate of good weapons in lockboxes are.  IMO, either make the lockboxes difficult to obtain but a decent chance at good loot...or make the lockboxes easier to obtain, but a low chance.  Having them difficult to obtain, AND a low roll chance is a little heartbreaking.

I can figure THAC0, Pilot an X-wing, Kill you from cockpit of a Hunchback, I’ve been on major guild raids, helped build online towns, helped write, publish, and promote a rpg, and I like to LARP at cons.  I married my GM 11 years ago, now we take turns, and play Pathfinder (currently) every weekend.  

I started playing Defiance two days after the TV premier.  I like RP servers on my MMO’s, and seeing a game that was going to be more shooter then MMORPG didn’t make me run out and buy it.  I kibitzed a bit over hubby’s shoulder, but wasn’t compelled to join in until I was introduced to the world via the show.  My main character is Anne Wrynn, and she is closing in on 900 ego.  

Here is my biggest complaint about the game:  Where are all the women?  

Now I’m not talking about the storyline, we have a wealth of female characters there, though I do find it annoying when they make references that seem to infer that I am male.  I know that the demographic for these games do not include me, so I can brush that aside.  

But when running around shooting mutants, raiders, 99ers, and Dark Matter I really have to wonder, Where are all the women?  Is there not even a small percentage that was as strong as their male counterparts?  Was it an odd, gender specific virus that killed them off?  Did they all say “Fuck this” and move away?  

Are they scared that gamers will freeze in indecision when faced with a pair of tits behind the machine gun?  

I don’t think so.  I think they would shoot her in the face, perhaps with a “Take that bitch” and move to the next target.  I know I would.  Right now the only “female” bad guy I’ve been fighting is the Matriarch, and well, she’s not that big of a bad ass.  My least favorite Major arkfall, seeing as everyone just stands around and shoots her in the face, then adjusts where they are standing slightly before she comes back up.  

Maybe there are female bad guys somewhere in the world and I just don’t have time to notice them.  Shoot and move on.   Honestly, however, I think I’d stop in the middle of combat for a second, just long enough to say “Hey look!  A girl!” feeling perhaps a jolt of pride and equality and smiling as I introduce the girlie to my VOT Techmag Pulsar.  

P.S.  And what’s the deal with only Irathi men getting top hats?  I can understand some outfits changing a little between sexes, maybe a bit between races, but come on, I should be able to wear a frakkin’ top hat.  I got a head.

&gt;These are great weapons with great bonuses that I earned by unlocking them. I’ve furthermore equipped them with a full suite of mods, which wasn’t cheap. Modding weapons is a significant resource sink in Defiance. These guns weren’t cheap. And given how there’s no level-based gear churn in Defiance, these guns should last me for a long time.
&gt;
&gt;**But where Defiance fumbles the sense of progression is by shutting off the weapon skill progression when you’re using a gun with a maxxed out experience point bar. Now that I’ve spent the time and resources to make these weapons the best that they can be, they no longer level up my weapon skill. Why would Defiance shut down weapon progression the moment a weapon is at its most useful?** What kind of awful design decision is that? Am I supposed to carry around a second light machine gun to use when I want to level up my LGM skill?

1365283279.0	1btemf	2 minor Defiance tips I have found	Rhysaff	28	4	38	"The very first bonus mission near the starting area where you respawn with a 3 shot shotgun can be made easier by standing beside the low wall near the spawn point (there is an orange wrecked car at one end).  They cannot jump over it so if you are getting swarmed, run back there and they will tend to group up a bit as they run around either side, makes targeting them a bit easier.

If you have any equipment that you cannot sell or delete or breakdown, you may have it still equipped on a different loadout.  Unequip it and you should be able to get rid of it.

If you are going to buy lockboxes, best to save up for Tier 4's, I don't think the others are worth it personally.

1375635566.0	1joqto	Why Defiance's price drop was not just a good, but a great idea.	Radiogirl1	33	9	29	"I've seen a lot of complaining about the recent price drop from early adopting players, and I can understand the frustration of paying full price for a game that's now dropped as low as it has, but the one thing I haven't seen argued anywhere is the other side of the coin:

I was in the beta and enjoyed my time in the game, but once beta was over, reality set in. With my personal economic reality, there was just no way I could justify sixty bucks for a new video game, especially not when there are so many free alternatives out there, not to mention all the games I already own.

Then, when the price dropped to under ten bucks, Defiance became affordable for me. By then, I'd already watched and enjoyed the entire first season of the show and I eagerly bought the game.

Frankly, I don't think I'm the only one with a story like this. The reality is that in order for MMO's to live long and prosper they need players, lots of them. In today's economic reality, with entertainment budgets usually the first to be trimmed on shrinking incomes, it's a lot easier to get players to shell out ten bucks than sixty bucks on a single entertainment purchase.

If no one wants to pay the asking price on a given game, then no one plays and the game dies. If the publisher is willing to cut the price, hoping to make it up by other avenues (and in Defiance's case, that includes bumping up the show's ratings and therefore sponsor advertising rates), more players play and the game survives to make more money for the publishers. When you consider that Defiance cost an estimated 100 million to make, that's a lot of incentive to keep the game viable as long as possible.

I mean, I get it. I'm a lifer in Star Trek Online and I haven't played that game in a long time. I shelled out bigtime for that game and I get zero use out of it now. At the same time, I also know that without the price drop I wouldn't be playing Defiance now, nor would many other players, and it wouldn't be as good of a game without those players playing. 

What the price drop did was help to ensure that the game survives and with it not only Trion's and Syfy's investment in it, but also the investment of all the players who have bought the game at any price. From my perspective, that has to be a good thing if you care about this game.

No, I don't mean that it was full of bugs, or laggy, or some features were implemented poorly - that's to be expected of any MMO at launch, and I feel that Trion actually dealt with (and still is dealing with) these issues pretty well. So kudos to Trion for that.

No, what I mean is that Defiance was shipped with all of the core gameplay mechanics in place and fully functioning. Admittedly, it's damn fun to play. What's missing is the meta game, the endgame. Every day, this subreddit sees a post that asks Trion for 'more meat,' or asks what there is left to do, or asks for an active guild because their's is dead. The truth is, there is no more meat, there's nothing to aim for, and players are leaving the game because of it.

Here I have compiled a selection of suggestions that I feel would greatly benefit the game at large by promoting continued engagement. As people invest more hours into the game, they will be more willing to invest MONEY into the game, which we all know is Trion/Syfy's driving force at the end of the day.

**AUCTION HOUSE**
-----
-----

Perhaps the most frequently-requested feature, auction houses are on the top of my list simply because almost everything else on this list ties back into it. The more interconnected systems are with the game's economy (which currently doesn't exist,) the more invested players will become in it.

**Buying**
The auction house itself should allow for multiple filters (manufacturer, weapon/mod type, rarity, keyword searches, ect…) to make it easy for prospective buyers to find what they are looking for. Upon finding what they wish to purchase, players are then taken to the seller's storefront, where they confirm their purchase, as well as having the ability to favorite that seller, if they have consistently good prices. (This adds loyalty as well as player identity.)

**Selling**
On the selling end of things, each player should be able to create their own storefront where their wares can be sold. (This ties into enhanced player identity, which I will be getting into later as well.) Selling an item allows players to set their own prices, creating a player-driven economy. (This will be expanded upon in a number of ways throughout this post.)

**SOCIAL INTERACTION**
-----
-----
Players need a place to congregate, and some kind of centralized town can easily tie into everything else that I'm proposing in this list. Every feature could have a physical presence in the world, such as a specific building or region of the town. If I have any specific ideas for this, I will explain within the corresponding section.

This section would include the nearly requisite complaints and suggestions for the chat system, but they've already been repeated ad nauseum, so I shan't go into it.

**HOUSING**
-----

Players should have a space to call their own. In other words, players should have a house. This could be done pretty easily: The central town could have an apartment building. Upon being selected, you could pick your own room, or the room of one of your friends or clanmates. When in your own room, you would have access to personal storage.

Players don't just get a free ride, though. They have to pay for their house with cold, hard, scrip. A basic house is cheap; a dusty shanty house, rotten through with rust. But if you've got the jaja, you can buy fancier houses. Maybe you'd like a Castithan commode complete with bath? And, of course, you could buy some housing with bits. Once you own a theme for your house, you can change it at any time with a control panel in the house.

**Decorate!**
And of course, what house is complete without a way to decorate it? These could be bought from vendors, through the auction house, crafted yourself, earned from pursuits! Kill 500 Pow? Here's a Pow head to mount on your wall!

**MORE AND BETTER EMERGENCIES**
-----
-----
I should clarify. I don't mean more active at a time in the world, but more variety. And maybe some that travel? Wandering Hulkers, for example. Why not have mutated bears wandering around the countryside? A Dark Matter convoy that can be intercepted and highjacked for great justice/loot?

This system has promise, but it needs to be expanded upon. (And, as an aside, more non-humanoid enemies. Show us some of this alien fauna!)

**CLANS**
-----
-----
Clans certainly exist right now, but they're little more than a second friends list. Sure, you can buy boosts for your clan if you're feeling altruistic, but with people leaving the game every day, there's ever-decreasing incentive to do so. Obviously, clans need a complete overhaul. But what needs to be done?

The biggest issue facing clans today is identity. Clans need to be able to build their own identity and differentiate themselves from the crowd. They also need a way to help the members of that clan feel like they are part of an exclusive group, and - if possible - that they're even an *important* part of that group.

**A Place to Call Home**
Every world-changing organization needs an impressive headquarters, and right now the best we've got is a crashed stratocarrier that everyone shares. A central town is a necessity for this idea to work, obviously, but a large building of some description that acted as a portal to a personalized clan hangout that only the members of the clan would be able to access.

This clan base could have any number of additional features and benefits for members, such as shared storage (donate old gear,) global message space, message board allowing communication/trading between people that aren't online at the time, ect…

**Only as Good as the Outfit**
Any powerful organization worth its salt has a banner to rally under, but Defiance currently has nothing other than a little white text to set you apart from everyone else. The leader of a clan should be able to select from a few different outfits and assign clan colors to them. These outfits would be available to all members of the clan for them to wear if they wish, adding to the feeling of a meaningful collective group. This could perhaps expand to a clan vehicle, but this is probably stepping on the toes of premium content a bit too much.

**LOOT**
-----
-----
Everything about the current state of loot should stay exactly as it is. I know, surprising, right? That's because I want to build another tier of loot on top of it. That is, lootable pieces. Pieces that are then crafted together to create new and exciting weapons. These weapons wouldn't just be there for a new set of stats, but they would work differently, and would directly tie into the auction house.

**Unique Craftables**
Each piece that a player finds belongs to a specific final weapon, but each piece has its own rarity. Upon crafting, the combined rarity of each piece is aggregated together to come up with the rarity - and quality - of the final weapon. Versions that are made of more rare pieces are obviously better, but also much less harder to get all of the pieces for. This creates a market not only for the finished product, but also for the individual pieces.

**Elemental Cores**
Rather than have a set element for each final weapon, each weapon should have an optional 'core' that can be included when crafting the gun that will set its element. So, you would be able to find a Shock Core, a Fire Core, a Syphon Core, and so on.

This idea could also be expanded to include an item that would set an inherent mod synergy for the weapon.

**Loot Tables**
As far as I know, Defiance currently doesn't have unique loot tables for each enemy type in the game. This grossly deincentiveses hunting the harder enemy types (anything that isn't hellbugs or mutants.) I recommend keeping it how it is, but giving each enemy a chance to drop a SPECIFIC crafting piece. So, people will have to grind for loot. Which, if my crafting system and auction house was put in place, grinding for said loot would give a definitive benefit.

**Guns with a Level**
With craftable loot, I've invented a whole new tier of gear that lays on top of what you can find from any random mutant, so these craftable items should be a little special, right? Well, what if each gun you craft can level up? Kinda like guns do currently, but they can level up more than once. Let's say… 10 times, just for a number. Each time you level up a gun, you get a bonus applied to it, much like the current system. What if you don't like the latest bonus? Throw it back in the salvage matrix and take a level/bonus off the gun. Do it enough times and get lucky enough, and you can max out any one of the bonuses, but it'll cost you to do that.

If you decide to sell this max-level weapon, you're contending with the bonuses other players have on their guns. There's multiple systems of value at play on the final item: The rarity of the pieces determines the overal stats, rarity of mods applied will of course affect value, and what bonuses are on the weapon will all affect the market value, which is determined by the community based on how much they're willing to spend for certain combinations.

**COMBAT SPECIALIZATION**
-----
-----
Another major issue that Defiance has at the current time is that everyone is more or less identical. This is an issue with implementing a classless system, and it's not helped by the fact that there's a lot of skills that don't really do very much. If you go as tanky as possible, you're not really that much less prone to damage than anyone else.

But… for better or worse, we're stuck with our current skills and a classless system. So, how do I propose this is fixed? With the addition of specializations. These could be implemented as a (craftable?) item, allowing players to change specializations at any time, just by swapping loadouts. Each specialization would function as a traditional class, but could be freely changed whenever the player wanted.

You could have a specialization that would make you have really high DPS and shield regen, but reduces your shield capacity. One that buffs the shit out of your defensive stats. One that boots range, recharge rate, and capacity of BMGs (which, the game should be harder so these things are actually worthwhile.)

The benefit of these specializations is that they allow players to change up their playstyle as frequently as they want without losing the progress on their characters (the benefit of a classless system,) but players have the ability to fill one of various combat roles (as many MMOs have shown to be a successful gameplay mechanic.)

As with my weapon level overhaul proposal, these specialization items could also be leveled up, giving players some sense of progression without allowing long-time players to completely roflstomp new players. (This is the reason Trion doesn't have level-based progression. Which I agree with, but there needs to be something to set us apart from the newbs and even each other.)

These leveled specializations could also be traded through an auction house, but I think it might be better to keep them locked to an account.

-----

**And now I open discussion to everyone.** I'd like to steer this away from bitching about the UI this, or the chat that, and focus on what can be done to keep people coming back to this game for years to come. Maybe we can't beat WoW, but god dammit, we can keep Defiance alive!

This, in an area of 15 enemies with perfect aiming and no other player to help you out results in extracting over and over again if you're doing a mission.

In any case, I think it would be nice if the enemies had just a little bit inaccuracy. Its not nice when you get hit with a stream of 50 or so bullets from an enemy that was standing well over 100km away and you don't even have a chance to react. "	t5_2siko	True

This reddit is for all things Defiance, this includes the TV show. Since the first episode will be airing on Monday, I wanted to go over a couple of things.

Spoiler tags **must** be used when you are talking about something that could potentially ruin somebody else's viewing experience. Spoilers are required for episodes until one (1) week after it has aired.

So for example: The first episode comes out on Monday April 15th. On Monday April 22nd, you are free to talk about that episode without the need for spoiler tags.

You can use spoiler tags by typing the following:

You can mark a an entire thread as a spoiler by clicking the ""spoiler"" link after your thread was created. This replaces the NSFW tag, since there shouldn't be any NSFW content on this reddit anyways.

1370493839.0	1frt1b	Let's Talk Sieges.	Beastmister	26	8	29	"Rawr folks, Beastie here.

Here's the deal.  Since sieges have come out I've been addicted to them and have found information useful in both a strategic and casual manner about this game mode.  Before I get into it though, I have to say that these are a blast--they're basically the type of Arkfall that wasn't implemented, a capture and hold style wave defence.  If you haven't tried them yet, dip your toes in with the afflicted event and here's hoping that the Volge sieges will be much, much more challenging because the play style of a siege is enthralling.

**Looking to Siege?  Here's Some Tips:**

* Sieges appear approximately once an hour on the open map, and for the afflicted event these sieges appear simultaneously at the four locations provided.
* Sieges are 15 minutes long when triggered, with no way to enhance the timer.  ~~Timers are triggered when any player moves too far into the area of influence, therefore you can stay on the outskirts of a siege area and wait for reinforcements to better your chances of getting to a further stage.~~ My previous statement seems to be somewhat inaccurate.  There is either a grace period before timers start or timers are triggered by players capturing a point, I'm not certain which.  I'll investigate further.
* You only need to clear out enemies of each stage to complete that stage and start a new one.  Capture points are not necesary, but aiding in re-capturing a point gives 100 score, and being in a siege area while points are player captured gives 10 score per half second per point.  (If ABC are captured, all players in the siege area gain ~~30~~ 60 score/second).
* End rewards are based off of personal score, not off of placement in the leaderboards.  Therefore, it's beneficial to all players in the siege to re-capture points as quickly as possible.
* As far as the afflicted go, Threshers and afflicted capture points take critical damage when their red tumors are hit.  Lesser creeps take critical damage from headshots.
* You gain weapon experience normally in a siege, so come prepared if you want to pick up some quick weapon ranks.  Have a backup weapon on hand!
* The easiest way to chain sieges together as it stands is to finish one and change phases.  Since the timer for sieges starts after the siege is over, when you change phases it will likely be on a lesser timer than a phase that just finished a siege.  Note that this may still leave a 10-20 minute gap on average, which is nice if you need to reset your weapon's mastery points!
* Sieges seem to progress much quicker with masses of players helping out.  Enemies scale in hitpoints like arkfalls, but the more explosives the merrier.  The farthest I've gotten is Chinatown Gate, stage 13, with approximately 60 players in the fray.
* Bosses are not worth many points compared to creeps, but they do drop loot to compensate.  Beyond that, bosses spawn more frequently after they first spawn.  For instance, Chinatown Gate hosts Bulwarks at stage 8 first, and then stage 12.
* Sieges are a wonderful place for explosive weapons.  That being said, I'm not one to promote cookie-cutter builds but perks like Deadly Cascade, Gunslinger, and Assassin's Cache (for Detonators) are great starter choices.  Unfortunately, the Afflicted have a low drop rate so Pinata or Just Reward aren't very effective.

I think that's it for now.  If anybody wants to add anything don't hesitate to chip in to the list, or discuss Siege strategy!  Hope to see you all on the field, cheers Ark Hunters!

And for any of you who haven't seen it, [here is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYMl8bmuFHc) a brief synopsis on Sieges as well.

*Edit:* Formatting.

Due to the timer trigger, it appears some sieges spawn in off-kilter unison.  I will investigate more on this."	t5_2siko	True

1366109441.0	1cgd27	I had a good time with defiance, but I can understand why the reviews aren't so great.	Vajazzle_TR	29	10	22	"While I appreciate that many people here are a big fan of Defiance, I’ve got a number of issues with it I’d like to flag to potential buyers of the game. I’m a big fan of MMO’s in general and when my friend explained Defiance to me I was pretty taken in by the whole idea. The TV show running parallel to the game and a lot of the features spoken about pre-launch sounded particularly appealing to me. 


I’ve had this week off work and I’ve played for  roughly 60 hours (Yea, I know – the weather has been awful)  and the content I have to complete has become so thin I’m finished with the game at ego level 534. I appreciate that I’m not a player who likes to repeat content, so I won’t keep running co-op missions and while I’m a big fan of PvP there are two competitive maps and outside of US prime getting into Shadow Wars is practically a non-starter. Shadow Wars is one of the better aspects of the game in my opinion, but as a Brit I have to wait until the evening to play at all. I don’t have a major issue with this but I can see how some people may find it irritating that they cannot log on and grab a solid match at all for five hours. 


There are some serious negatives to this game. My most minor of the issues is that it feigns the MMO genre by a) offering quests and b) having many people present at once. The most interaction I’ve had with other players constitutes two emotes and a single line of text from an angry player regarding a PvP match. That’s 60 hours and no real interaction with anyone aside from the occasional fire fight in the same area. The game doesn’t feel or act like an MMO and while, again, I have no issue with this (and it may not be claimed anywhere) don’t go into the game expecting that particular experience because it’s just not here. In this sense, the game feels very much like borderlands (not in theme, moreover in feel) if the world was constantly active and people didn’t need to connect to your session, they were just there. Doing their own thing. [NO SPOILERS] The quests from the major plot are repetitive and bland, although to be fair the storyline is quite good. It’s not as fleshed out as I expected but it’s certainly worth a playthrough. Every single main quest follows the same format from start to finish and it gets seriously fucking boring. The EGO in your brain (the computer plugin) has about 5 lines of ‘incoming’ text and every fucking mission does this shit where you go in, save someone, defend them while they do some shit on a computer then the EGO cycles through the same 4 lines.



‘WE’VE GOT [insert mob type] INCOMING FROM THE NORTH!’

‘WE’VE GOT [insert mob type] INCOMING FROM THE SOUTH!’

‘WE’VE GOT [insert mob type] INCOMING FROM THE EAST!’

‘WE’VE GOT [insert mob type] INCOMING FROM THE WEST!’



You then defeat the waves one by one, revive the guy you were defending and move on to the next mission. I’m not even kidding, almost EVERY SINGLE MAIN MISSION follows this format (especially toward the end) except for a few where you have to scan/place/interact with an object yourself before the 


‘WE’VE GOT [insert mob type] INCOMING FROM THE NORTH!’

‘WE’VE GOT [insert mob type] INCOMING FROM THE SOUTH!’

‘WE’VE GOT [insert mob type] INCOMING FROM THE EAST!’

‘WE’VE GOT [insert mob type] INCOMING FROM THE WEST!’


Shit. I don’t know if others haven’t noticed this but even on the hell bug quests you do the objective and then it’s just spam waves like a boss. There’s no real variation and it’s not covered up particularly well. 


Quite frankly the side quests are embarrassing,ridiculously flimsy and fail to hold my attention for longer than around 30 seconds. It’s almost an insult how awful these are. You go to a ‘!’, pick up your quest, and the objective is usually within around a 10 second drive and takes less than a minute to complete. They are seriously awful and seem like a total rushed afterthought. 


As a predominantly PvP interested player, the PvP is good and enjoyable with the exception of getting run the fuck over every two seconds (people don’t even bother to dismount and shoot half the time, you can be in a decent fight and just get shat on by vehicles) and everyone else playing cloak shotgun. It’s fucking infuriating to get point blanked by a shotgun every two seconds when you can’t even see half of the enemy team because they are invisible. Shadow Wars is a novel and great idea and I can’t recommend it enough, yet there is only one gametype (I understand another was removed and will be returning). Also that open microphone shit in PvP. I play on a fucking PC, not a console. I don’t expect to have to mute everyone every fucking match because some guys kid is crying and someone else is giving their microphone a blowjob while he has major building work going on in the next room. We’re past that, and it’s fucking irritating to hear. 


I’ve enjoyed my time with defiance but there’s just no content left for me to come back to. In my personal opinion this game wasn’t worth 35 quid for what I got out of it and I certainly won’t be purchasing any DLC if the content is just as rushed and paper thin as what I’ve seen so far. This is quite a negative rant but if the price drops to 25, sure, I’d pick it up any day of the week and consider DLC packs yada yada season pass DLC shit but right now this seems like Trion are really pushing their luck. I’ve seen some threads asking about the PC population and to be frank I can only see it going down from here on in. There’s some pretty sweet stuff in the game and some good ideas but really… There’s no real content if you’re not interested in achievements or completing every single trivial side quest in the game. I can understand why some of the reviews I’ve seen for the game are around the low 60% mark, as this game has a lot of feeling and is quite enjoyable – it just feels rushed and unfinished. I’m sure there will be updates and new PVP maps to add to the existing TWO choices, but I have a feeling it will be more of the same. If you’re looking for an expensive single player game with console values (repetition, low levels of social interaction and being rather blasé about the entire content/dlc thing all the while hearing some fat guy eating a pot noodle through a straw) sure, this game is perfect to drop cash on. Otherwise I’d do some homework on it first and check out some of the reviews. 

The EGO pages are bland and boring and the variations are bland and uninteresting. There's no real personal touches or decisions here, it's just entirely bland.

It’s not a terrible game but it’s certainly nothing special and in places gets downright tiresome and boring, mostly after the main story is complete and you are left with literally nothing substantial to do - 60 hours in. The introduction of vehicles early on makes the world incredibly small and trivial and this feeling never goes away. It's impossible to fail missions and there's no real sense of challenge or urgency anywhere in the game due to it. 


Just my 2 pence for anyone looking to maybe purchase. Honestly it sounds very negative but it's an OK game. Honestly if I could get frequent and varied pvp from the game regularly and on time I'd be very happy.

1371861441.0	1gtw0q	THEORY: Earth was to be conquered (And that is still the plan!)	angeleus09	24	7	24	"TL; DR It may not have been the initial plan, but once they knew enough about us they decided we didn't deserve our planet and hatched a plan to clear us out. Even after Arkfall, the plan has changed but the goal is the same.

We all know the story: the Votans, bereft of their home, traveled to a habitable planet and were suprised to find that it was already populated. Hat in hand, they asked for refuge and we all know what happened next.

With the recent revelation that the Votans studied humans well before they arrived on Earth and went so far as to prepare sleeper assassin clones who would have had access to Earth's leaders, we see that First Contact wasn't nearly as innocent as they would have had us believe.  We can reasonably assume that it wasn't too difficult for them to learn all about our political systems, economy and the various weaknesses of our civilization. 

At this point I think one of two things happened within the Votan leadership:

* They split into two factions. One which argued that we didn't deserve our planet and  advocated getting rid of us completely or subjugating us for service, the other argued for our right to exist and for co-existence.
* There was a majority agreement that we needed to go

Whether it was just a faction of the Votan leadership acting directly or indirectly to further their own interests or a unanimous strategy, they decided the best way to get rid of us was to get us was to start a war by having the human race land the first blow. We are all aware of the story of the disgruntled guy who assassinated Onulu Torkuru, the Votan U.N. Ambassador. [The assassin was apparently suffering from stomach pains in the days prior to the attack,](http://defiancenews.tumblr.com/post/45272885049/breaking-news-18-march-2023) does anyone remember the persuasion method Pol Matis used on Datak in [Episode Six?](http://www.defiance.com/en/series/video/2646784)

**Why would the Votans risk the casualties of war on their own side?**

I'm guessing they calculated that their advanced weaponry and medical technology would minimize their losses. Not only were their conventional weapons stronger than ours, [they held back from introducing The Volge to humanity, waiting until it was required for them to fulfill their purpose as shock troops.](http://defiancenews.tumblr.com/post/45861171530/nuclear-power-comes-to-st-louis) While it could be argued that The Volge were not introduced because their intimidating presence would not have done much for the Votan push for settlement, it is more likely that they were purposely held in reserve as a strategic military advantage.

**But why would the Votans destroy their Ark ships and so many of their people along with them?**

I think the original plan (for taking over) was to use as few Votans as possible on the ground to clear out or significantly reduce the human presence on Earth and after they had taken over, then the remaining Votans would be woken. There is also the possibility that political maneuvering made sure that certain Votans were taken out of hypersleep first as they were supporters of the clean sweep agenda. 

The destruction of the Arks was either a last ditch effort by humans, or Votans who vehemently opposed the genocidal plan, or a move by the rogue Votan leadership to remove any option of leaving Earth in search of a new place in favor of continuing to fight(which may have been brought up when the Pale Wars began to stretch out long past their expectations). It may not even have been the symbolic ""burning of the ships"" but instead a malfunction of trying to launch the terraforming systems in an effort to wipe out humans through cataclysmic, wide-scale destruction. 

**Well now there is no option, no one is leaving Earth and the Battle of Defiance, as well as the town are proof that humans and Votans have both realized they need to work together to survive, right?**

According to the [World Map of 2046](http://www.defiance.com/en/series/world-of-2046/2046-map) the large colony of Sulos in South America is continuously expanding it's borders year after year. It is also a popular belief that the construction of the coast-to-coast maglev train by the E-Rep is actually a plan to build the infrastructure for a line of defense to prevent a Votan push north. I believe the Votans are still intent on conquering as much of the habitable space left on Earth as they can.

**Great, so how does that play into the events in the show?**

If you remember when Pol Matis and Datak were talking they spoke of the Votan leadership in South America in a way that made them sound almost like the mob, with Datak at one point promising to contribute more to ""the effort."" I believe the Votanis Collective has Votan operatives placed in strategic locations around the globe (places like Definace) and are using this network to politically or militarily move their people into places of power in non- consolidated areas to set up a final push for takeover. I believe Stahma is one of these operatives and is using Datak to accomplish her goals.

1370936496.0	1g3wod	The Plague: A Theory	Tobar	17	2	9	"First I want to say that the event on the whole was fun. Sieges are a fantastic new addition to the game and I'll be saddened having to wait for them to return after this week has passed.


That said, the overall handling of the story for this event left a lot to be desired. The final mission appears seemingly out of nowhere with no explanation as to why you knew to meet Eren or what you were there to help her with. After the conclusion of this event I'm left with the feeling that a lot of intended and important content was left out for some unknown reason.

Why this is, I'm not certain. I can only presuppose that the developers ran out of time before they could complete all of it and so were forced to make do with what they had.

This is the chain of events as we were presented:


* **Week One**: A sickness has broken out across Paradise and a series of data recorders reveal that it is the start of an epidemic. It is also revealed that Eren has sent the arkhunter (you the player) out to gather resources to work on a cure, despite no such quest or interaction with Eren having taken place.  
* **Week Two**: Stage Four of the sickness has spread out across Paradise wreaking havoc. Sieges appear where you are seemingly tasked with protecting dispensers that contain a cure that Eren has concocted.  
* **Week Three**: An episode mission appears on your map and when you arrive Eren expresses her gratitude that you are there. No explanation is given as to how you knew to meet her there or why. She remains quiet while you run across Dark Matter, a large number of inflicted and self-activating turrets. She finally pipes up once you arrive at the last room and asks you to clear the room of more Dark Matter so that she can activate a missile that will deliver her cure to the town of Defiance. The missile launches, the end.


From the very start this event felt disjointed and lacking of much context. Which is why I theorize that large chunks are missing. I believe the intended sequence of events went something like this:


* **Week One**: A sickness has started to spread across Paradise. Eren summons you, Lawkeeper Cooper and Ara Shondu to discuss what she believes is the start of an epidemic. She's already quarantined a number of patients who have progressed to the later stages of the plague. During the meeting she's attacked by one of her patients as stage four sets in across the compound. They are then forced to escape the facility only to discover Stage Four has already spread across Paradise.  
* **Week Two**: Eren sends you out to gather materials to work on a cure as the inflicted raise havoc across Paradise. You gather all of the needed materials and are then tasked with completing at least one siege to protect the dispensers until they can launch to release the cure into the surrounding atmosphere.  
* **Week Three**: Meanwhile, the plague has found its way to the town of Defiance and Doc Yewll reaches out to her old colleague Eren for help. Time is of the essence so Eren devises a way to repurpose an old ICBM as a quick delivery system to aide Defiance.


As for how Dark Matter fit into this. There are a number of possibilities. One is that the ICBM belonged to Dark Matter and they didn't appreciate its theft. Two, either Dark Matter is behind the plague or were at least hired to insure no help is rendered to Defiance.


I believe it's a strong probability that the Irathient Flu was purposefully weaponized in another attempt to destroy the town of Defiance.


What still remains a mystery is how Eren learned of the ICBM and how she was able to repurpose it in such a drastic way through the launch panel in a matter of minutes. It's possible she had already done all of the necessary work beforehand when Dark Matter showed up to prevent the launch.

*This is my first public attempt at some fan fiction and I thought I'd post here to get some feedback.  I've been a casual writer for a long time and an really into the Defiance lore, so I thought I'd spark up some content based around my character, Thaeya Balor (AKA Sixteen).  This is Part I of a multi-part story I'm working on and will post in installments if you folks like it, so enjoy!*



**Cloud Ninety-Nine**



Patrol duty never did pay off well, but hazardous to health and wealth as it was, some things were necessary in the pits of San Fran.  The day started off bright and early with a distress call from E-Rep’s Foxtrot road watch being bombarded with arkfall debris; caused a lot of attention but unfortunately not every piece of space garbage is worth more than its weight on the market.  Thaeya was exhausted from the night before, but at least lending a helping hand to the military medics had its perks.

She decided to pull in behind a half-rubble house and park for a break.  They called it a point of safety, because the building marked a half-klick range outside of the Overpass, which was the maximum safe distance of a mortar strike if soldiers ever got into trouble.  Being a town regular of sorts, the ark hunter had her fair share of favours to call her house as close to safe as one could get.  Her roller had seen better days, she could tell from the way her half-busted driver side mirror rained shattered glass onto her lap when it was popped open.

Yeah, the same could be said for her, but that was the life she chose.  Thaeya examined the bags under her eyes and for a moment the thought passed through her head that she felt almost human.  So this is what it feels like to run for so long even Irathient blood can’t keep up.  Dirt scattered across the tribal markings on her face left her with a sense of indecency, but unfortunately her safe house didn’t come with a running shower.  It was no matter though, because relief was at hand as she brushed off the glass from her outfit and unlatched the glove compartment.

Complete in a stainless steel pouch was a single serving of her latest addiction, and in a deep breath of clarity she snatched the case out of the otherwise empty locker and slammed it shut.  The girl clenched her left fist a few times while fiddling with the metal locket, propping open a layout of a piece-by-piece syringe to go with a small vial of fluorescent orange liquid.  Synthetic delay adrenaline: a fancy compound safer than caffeine for the soldier that didn’t have time to get an injection on the battlefield.  Lately it was the love of her eighteen-hour patrols.

Building the cell and slipping its sharp point under the skin of her forearm, she drained the chemical cocktail and gently set the remainders aside.  There wasn’t any feeling yet, but that was the best part—she had time to rest.  For an ark hunter it was debatable that closing your eyes was as valuable as gulanite, and what started as a joke of the trade soon became an ode to the fallen.

Rubbing her hand from cheek to brow in a slow dredge, the grit and grime collected on her clammy crimson skin didn’t seem to bother her as much when she couldn’t see it through a mirror.  “One day I’ll close my eyes and find the richest mine there is,” she muttered with a smirk, masking the midday glow with her palm.  “Yeah, that’ll be the day.”

Not that she wasn’t making enough money to keep comfortable, but the downside to vacation time was that all the other badland roadies were potentially stealing your payday.  Even at that, the veteran was running a mental checklist of the commodities she was secretly begging for: clean water, a bed that wasn’t a car seat, a fresh meal, clothes not crusted in blood, and smokes.  Oh, cigarettes were a royal treat.

Paradise of relaxation was abruptly ended when her dashboard monitor screeched a warning signal.  The gadget startled her nerves and she reacted quickly to scan any information from the event.  Incoming arkfall, and it was blazing in just off the southeast clouds.  Even as her software went through analysis she could tell just by eyeing the size of the plummeting fireball that it was guaranteed scrip.

“Paydirt,” she said while revving up the engine of her charger.  Maybe a holiday wasn’t so far away after all.  With a flash on her screen she couldn’t help but widen her grin reading the results, “Sensoth ballistics wing, bearing impact less than a klick off the bridge.  Here’s hoping it doesn’t wreck itself.”

The Irath’s dirty car bellowed a roar as it swiveled out of its half-broken garage.  Already miniature debris was pelleting the area, battering Thaeya’s hood with an unusual shimmer.  Most ark rain had some level of awe due to the metallic nature of the orbiting belt, but once in a while alloy rain was nothing aside of breathtaking.  As the sturdy car soared and ripped through terraformed San Francisco it repelled glittering shrapnel that reflected contesting light from the sun and arkfall; dangerous to be in without protection, but a photographic wonder to the new world.

Blazing above the Overpass, Thaeya swiped the receiver from her dashboard display on hearing an incoming broadcast.  The EMC was calling an armored escort to meet any hunters at Golden Gate, and retreating stations from the area.  Tapping her earpiece, the hunter sent out a message of her own after military orders were sent.   “Don’t think you’ll be getting a cut from any of this, Clancy.”

For a moment there was no answer, but resurging on a private channel a charming male voice chimed in, “I think we owe you one by now, Sixteen.  Much of a grudge you have against Grant, the EMC has your back when you hit impact point.”

“You boys make San Fran a cozy place,” she replied in a darkly comedic manner.

“Wouldn’t be half as nice without the help, Irath.  Staff sergeant Clancy out.”  The channel turned offline with a chime.

In a wild screech the veteran stopped her car after hitting Golden Gate, first on site and idle before impact.   Watching the meteorites always brought a flicker of the past to Thae, being just a child when she was brought on the arks reminded her of all the strange things she saw.  Once in a while, rummaging through wreckage there’d be something recognizable.  It brought a sincere smile to her face as she unclipped her receiver and nabbed some thicker wear from the back seat.

It was only after padding was donned and the driver door opened with a kick that there came sounds unknown, howling in all distances through the hazy afternoon.  Usually the day would bring clearer conditions, but a fireball that size brought with it heavy soot and smog.

“No chance on staying ignorant to where the wild things are,” the veteran told herself as she snapped her door shut and readied her loyal autopistol, “never just an easy payout.”
 
Just like a play on stage, the arkfall scene unfolded as brilliantly as Broadway itself.  The star of the show introduced to the world, followed by their trusted associates in a tumultuous situation, wrapping up with a vile conflict for glorious dramatic appeal.  And in turn, rumbling of the military’s heavy Titan trucks approached from the distant south and mysterious figures launched onto the bridge from the north with weapons ready.

It was a civil understanding that fellow hunters cleared vital threats before degrading to bickering over the spoils of war.  Not always followed, but more often than not the rebellious ended up with red attire.  Thaeya hailed to the newcomers arriving in tandem, knowing from experience anyone brave enough to trek the Golden Gate had their wits about ark hazards.  Many she recognised as they filed in, some were new faces, and a select few she wouldn’t see again.  Such was the life of her career.

“Cover up, roadies,” she beckoned to the surrounding population with a high wave of her firearm.  “Let’s brace for impact and aftermath.”

The bridge wasn’t her first rodeo near open water, so she knew well enough to crouch behind her charger with windows rolled up.  The punks that arrived on two-wheelers wouldn’t be so lucky to get a dry seat on the ride out.  And then it was, in a spontaneous combination like a tidal wave and a sonic bomb, the fireball hit with a shockwave mean enough to turn Golden Gate into a white water river.  Debris of old cars washed away and the unprepared had trouble enough not joining the rusty frames in the blast.  Thaeya, however, was happy enough to only have down to her shoulders soaked in the downpour.

Bits of blazing metal were sprawled in all directions.  Sparks and faulty electronics littered the bridge making it a dangerous position for anyone distracted enough to take a wrong step.  Impact caused so much steam it was a chore determining north from south anymore, but the dull ringing in her ears aside she was stable enough for surveillance.

“Call out any sudden movements!”  The Irath shouted hard, but was only able to feel the chords of her throat in the call.  She was closest to the ark when it hit, and the concussion did a heavy number on her hearing.

Nothing, absolutely zero was visible and it was only getting worse with the accumulating steam.  Looking from anywhere else she was certain the gate had disappeared in a cloud.  It still wasn’t safe; in instinct she vaulted on the roof of her vehicle and knelt down, scoping the area and keeping an arm pointed north for reference.  Losing sight of the entire scene put her on edge, and being deafened didn’t calm her nerves.  

One hundred second passed, the veteran continued to count patiently with pistol ready and eyes peeled even though her surroundings were stagnant.  Staying still so long to breathe in the hot air left her concentration thin and her dress collar muddled with sweat.  The dull ringing in her ears was beginning to fade; she was thankful to know there’d be some sense of awareness beyond the sonic sting.

Thunderous bass rumbled from the north perking her attention and her gun in that direction, but it was the wrong move to make.  In a sharp echo her hearing returned full scale just in time to catch the familiar screech of a razor-toothed skitterling vaulting at her from the side.  Her body lurched downward like a magnet, her pistol tumbling forwards onto the hood of her car, and the squealing bug clipped Thaeya’s jaw before detonating mid-air in confetti of guts and glory.

“Tango sighted!  Bravo, move in, lock that post down!”  EMC snipers caught the bogey just in time to stop it from gouging the back of her neck.

The hunter wiped her wound with her knuckles in a shameful grimace.  She hated being caught off guard.  It wouldn’t happen again, and that was damn sure.  Looking forward she saw the clearing scene of hellbugs by the dozen crawling off girders and through concrete potholes, inevitably peppering the bridge with blood just like her prized roller.

Heel on the windshield, she rolled onto her hood and snatched up her weapon.  In a sly smile Thae clutched the trigger a half dozen times before taking her first breath of air not compacted with heat.  “Let’s get this party started!”

And yet, in the most recent episode, her self-interested and maniupalative personality re-emerges. She also doesn't seem to have any problem with commanding her husband. Like the Greek saying goes 'The man may be the head of the house, but the woman is the neck.' 

To me, she comes off as emotionally manipulating Kenya. Why? Because Kenya is Amanda's sister, and she can use Kenya to get to Amanda. Added to this is the fact that the Wiki describes Castithans as sexually liberal and willing to exchange sex for favours. Furthermore, Stahma was an upperclass-woman, and so could easily hope to re-achieve power, not to mention her plan with Datak and Elah's marriage. 

My friend disagrees with me, saying that her formulating her husband's plans are part of her submission to him, and that her connection with Kenya is part of her 'liberation'.

I LOVE this game, and have been playing it nearly non-stop since it's release, completed it's content and have kept myself busy with Arkfalls, random encounters, pve and pvp. I want what's best for this game, i want to see it grow and get much better. Some of the things I say may even already be in the works for some future patch.


This is a list of fixs/suggestions that I personally would enjoy seeing in the game. feel free to make your own. I'm on my cellphone so bare with me of words coming out wrong (auto-correct) or if the format sends you into a blood frenzy.

1. Chat- By now I'm sure everyone knows how unfriendly the chat is and how it's killing the community. here is where I don't mind at all if they ""steal"" it from other MMOs, if it's not broken don't fix it. and as of right now, i'd say it's a priority for this game's continued health. Doing anything else would be like trying to stop the bleeding of a guy who can't breath first, he'll suffocate long before he bleeds out.

2. Centralized player Hub-  This is a Multi-Fold suggestion that goes back to the community and convieniance. One of the reasons this game feels socially dead is because of the lack of a true gathering spot for players, adding this will make socializing, grouping, new/old players that have questions that need to be answered and recruitment much easier.


3. Another thing about a Centralized Hub is convenience, not having to fast travel to two or three smaller outposts to find supplies, mods, or trade. To prevent vehicle griefing placing shops inside, behind a railing, or slightly elevated would help immensely.


4. With a Centralized hub or even two, a range of defense events with the various npc factions could be an exciting endeavor. failure makes the central hubs under enemy npc control and need to be retaken by players. the game is already set up so players don't truly need a central hub, so having it under enemy control is very possible.

5. This could also extend to the Shadow War, having two bases one for each faction where a player can ""switch to and from pvp mode"" and have the various outposts under one of the two faction's control, making for a much larger open-world warfare. give reputation points based on sticking with the same pvp faction to allow people to switch but more incentive to stick to one. Switching to ""pvp mode"" shouldn't prevent you from still doing missions and arkfalls.


6. Major Arkfalls- These are great, but once you've seen a few it's rather repetitive and a little mind numbing. There's a Huge open space, this pretty much gives you plenty of breathing room to do whatever you want with Arkfall events. Lets see some massive raider/99er/mutant/dark matter bases to recover an arkfall they have already secured.  using the brilliant idea of the enemies coming out of doors, trucks, and all kind of other ways, you can make a large facility or mobile base of sorts for players to fight in, and the ""Boss"" could be a number of things, from one strong trashing about the place, a small group of special forces types, or a ""Defend for xx:xx amount of time"" from increasing waves (starship trooper sytle hellbug defense anyone?) I Could go on forever about the types of major encounters that are possible and i'm sure you can too but lets move on.


7. Loot- Don't know about others, but I've been getting so many shotguns and BMGs I could vomit a healing stream then launch myself into orbit with the force of the accumulated buckshot seemingly coming out of my ass. Would be nice to have a hidden ""lockout"" that rerolls the item if you get more than two of the same type. not necessary but wow this is annoying. witch brings me to #8


8. Salvage. click. click. yes. click- for the love of whatever deity you have chosen to fill the void in your life allow us to have an option to Auto-Salvage rarity types. Example: Auto-Salvage Blue and below, pick up a blue or green, get resources instead. simple and saves you A LOT of time.


9. Story Mission Replays- Neat story, can I Haz it again? please? few people will want to make a new character to just play the story again since you only really need to make one character. Be nice to have an option to replay a story mission that we've completed, or even Reset our story progression.


10. Cerberus Based Missions-  Me and my friends doing donuts running over raiders and blasting them away with mounted guns? yes please.


11. The Menu UI- I'm sure it's on a drawing board somewhere being redone, but how did it get how it is in the first place? seriously...come-on. There's so many other games out there with better Menus I honestly don't even have a suggestion, just pick one.


12. EGO score- This is an odd one to mention i'm sure and it may be a little too late to change the progress rate, but it feels to me as tho we level it way too fast. its a big number that doesn't do too much to write home about. Maybe at 5000/10,000, the score number could reset back to 0 be much slower to progress and have some symbol next to it or something, guess like prestige from other games. three years from now I'd hate to to still be 5,000, or have the 0s take over my top bar.


13. Solo Instancing-  Maybe a world message if someone manages to complete an Instance Solo without extracting and some some separate achievements from doing it grouped (Scrapworks gives you a different color of the EMC Heavy Trooper or something). I'd enjoy the challenge even without incentives, but some people need incentive to do anything it would seem.


14. Loot Gambling- Similar to the Diablo series and the lockbox system, a grossly overpriced asshat that sells you a single gun/shield/grenade that is unidentified, tho you do choose the item type but it's stats and rarity are rolled on purchase. You'll either love it or hate it, but you'll still use him because it's addicting, this gives you more things to spend script on, and you don't have to worry about getting 4 shotguns from a lockbox if you can afford it.

15. Profanity Filter- On or Off switch, simple.

16. Shut up and take my money!- More outfits and crap to stick on me head in the shop. Why so few? do you hate money? I'm mad about hats! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJkg_9536PU

I'd like to list what I (think I) learned about the different weapons. Love to hear your feedback so I can get my release char off in the right direction straight away.

Pistols: Way underappreciated. Look for high crit value. Good for long Arkfall fights and when dealing with the bigger bugs. The slow firing ones are just too slow.

Shotguns: Way overappreciated. Range is short, total damage is quite low and reloading is a pain, even with clip. Slugs are inaccurate and don't do a lot of damage. Use on smaller mobs and in chaotic cqc.

Assault Rifles: Never leave home without one. Take damage over rate of fire to make your ammo last longer.

SMG: Spray-'n-pray. You get the most out of a larger (80 round) clip. Not much difference between a fast firing AR and a SMG, imho.

LMG: Like the AR but with its own ammo pool. Long reloads.

Sniper Rifle: I'll take the auto over manual any day since the crosshairs return to the exact same position after recoil and you can spam fire. Crit rating is the most important value.

Big-things-that-go-BOOM: Do a lot less damage than you'd expect them to. Somewhat useful (but shiny) in coop or Arkfalls. Run out ammo real fast.

--
Also: Try different weapons for yourself instead of judging them by the stats. Be sure to enable damage numbers in your settings so you can find out what works and what doesn't."	t5_2siko	True

**The World**

We're living in a semi-post-apocalytic place populated by aliens and humans. The landscape, people, places and TV show would have us believe that life is hard, money is tight, everyone is competing for the same resources and survival is anything but a given. Threats come fast, unexpectedly and often. Trust is rare. 


**The Current Player Experience**

The game does not match this promise. 

I'm rich. I'm rarely in any mortal danger. If I do die, who cares, I basically start where I left off. I don't need friends because everything is surmountable alone. I don't need to trade, negotiate, fight, sneak, steal, group up, save, plan or do anything else that you'd expect to do when life is hard.

I own more than ten vehicles and they all fit in my pocket. Most of them were purchased for 500 scrip, or about the equivalent of selling a blue gun. 

Granted, combat is fun and I like the gunplay mechanics. There's a lot of things to shoot and errands to run. Driving is enjoyable. Plenty of variety in activity types. 

But **none** of it has any gravity because you're okay without it and doing it is easy.  The world doesn't change much and my character doesn't change much and it's all very stale and shallow.


**The Evolving Player Experience**

Mostly, I want the game to push me more as a player and pay off the promise of the universe Trion/SyFy has created. Here are my Top 10 initiatives:

**All enemies will be balanced, at a minimum, around a 4-person group size:**

* Enemies will have their baseline stats start at the equivalent stats for a 4 player group, and they will scale upward from there.

* We will introduce better tools (LFG comm feed) to help you find groups for missions and challenges. You can still solo and pair play, but it will be more difficult.


**Death will suck more:**

* Extracting will drop you at a hospital facility at the nearest settlement (with the existing 180 scrip penalty for transport and patching you up).

* You still get a timed self-revive and you can still be revived by friends, but there's now a much greater inconvenience for exhausting your options. So, be careful.


**Vehicles will be fewer in number and matter more:**

* All color variations will be changed to paint jobs, which can be purchased and applied to vehicles like mods.

* All vehicles will have storage added, which acts like an extension of the player inventory. Storage size varies by vehicle type.

* Vehicles scrip prices increased across the board. All players still receive the starting Growler.

* Purchased vehicles are more noticeably improved over base Growler.

* Vehicles no longer disappear and get summoned within seconds.

* If in the field, vehicles will remain where you leave them (but ""cloak"" when you are not near to save resources) and will only time out after 10 minutes, not seconds.

* Requesting your vehicle from another location requires someone to retrieve it for you, which takes 20 seconds and costs 100 scrip.

* Cars returned to settlements can be stored and summoned immediately, without cost, when at any settlement


**We're adding more ways for you to interact with other. Aside from the increase in difficulty (see #1), we're adding more occasions to interact with your fellow ark hunters:**

* All settlements will have a pub and casino where players can bet scrip on several games of chance, chat, drink virtual drinks and buy for each other.

* We're adding a WANTED board for players to post gear bounties. Request an item, attach a bounty and let people hunt for items for you. 


**Reputation system overhaul:**

* Players may grant each other reputation points. You can only grant one rep point per day, so use it wisely. Rep points provide discounts at vendors and are displayed with the player's name. You can only grant a rep point to the same player once a month

* Faction reputation now consists of prominence and credit. Prominence increases as contracts are completed and grants access to better items, faction outfits, titles and vehicles; credit is earned with contracts and is expended instead of scrip for items


**Survival elements will be added:**

* Each player has a stockpile of food, water and other supplies. This will deplete as the player spends time in the game. Emergency events, and places like Raider camps, can yield supplies as part of completion.

* Crates and containers will be marked with food, water, medical supplies and other iconography to indicate what is granted for a mission. These resources can be sold or traded. 

* Players may only store a maximum of supplies at a time, so you'll never stockpile an astronomical amount. Remember, space is precious.

* Running out of supplies results in daily scrip loss as players pay for food, water, etc. as needed

* Clan members share a common supply pool, as though all individual supply allotments and storage have been combined

* No money and no supplies results in an inability to pursue formal missions or challenges and penalties to health and sprint speed (i.e. you need to go into the world and replenish your resources before you die)


**Revisions to weapons:**

* Using EXP-maxed weapons will now raise your overall weapon skill, but at half rate

* Players may mark one weapon as a ""trusted firearm"", which yields an additional bonus of the player's choosing (damage, crit %, fire rate, mag size, reload speed, etc.); only one weapon may be marked as a trusted firearm, and this can only be changed once every 72 hours

* Trusted firearms may be given custom names (""The Violator""), which appear over the gun's model name to the player and others inspecting him/her

* Firearms wear out over time and must be repaired regularly using ark salvage; worn out weapons are not destroyed, but stop working; the more worn out, the more expensive to repair; repairs are a one-button click from the inventory, with a ""repair all"" button; wear and tear is shown next to the weapon info; frequently-used weapons can be marked to auto-repair


**EGO customization and revisions:**

* Voice packs will be added that allow you to change the personality, look and voice of your EGO to better match your preferences

* Your EGO will start to make commentary about things around you based on reputation of other players, combat situations, etc.


**Cash shop changes:**

* Cash shop helmets and outfits halved in price

* More vehicle types added to cash shop; all side grades to vehicle available in game

* EGO customization packs available, as in #8


**Quality of life changes:**

* Grouped players will always and automatically phase together when entering open world missions (such as Seascape Farms)

* Co-op instances now reset correctly

* Items can be salvaged directly from inventory

* Salvaged items can be recovered similarly to the buy back feature at vendors (for up to 48 hours)

* Flag for items to make them ""unsellable/unsalvagable""

* Player storage/lockers added at most fast travel locations

* Barbers now available in most settlements where players can change their hair for a scrip fee

* Enemy AI improved to be more menacing and unpredictable

* Enemies now spawn with occasional buffs, such as extra body or head armor that is resistant to certain damage types

* Enemies may drop mods as loot instead of weapons and shields


**...and after that?**

* Player housing

* Faction warfare (true open world PvP)

* PvE and PvP raids

* Underground facilities

I made a fairly long post on the [PC Beta Feedback Forum](http://forums.defiance.com/showthread.php?10621-Field-of-View) about field of view in the PC version of the game. For those who don't want to go to the forums, here's a reddit-friendly version of my post.

*****

**Field of View**

I have [posted about this before](http://forums.defiance.com/showthread.php?6456-PC-Settings-Requests), but I feel like this subject deserves additional discussion and needs more visibility. This is a subject that, in my opinion, is critical to the game's success on the PC platform.

**What is Field of View?**

Field of view (FOV) is the degree of vision you have available. A human has a complete 180 degree field of vision, with about 120 degrees of observable vision (the remaining 60 being peripheral vision). In a video game, your field of view is determined by a variable setting, which dictates how many degrees around your character you can see. A low FOV setting would result in seeing things closer up, but you would have less peripheral vision of what's going on to your left and right. There are also vertical elements to FOV, but that's another discussion entirely.

All you need to know is that FOV determines how much you can see to the left and right of your character.

**I'm still confused, what the hell are you talking about?**

That's fine! Perhaps a visual display will help out. Here's a [great video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G7wKzDoUMY) a YouTuber made that showcases what field of view does. If you don't have the patience to watch through a whole video, here's a simple visual to demonstrate what field of view is.

[Image](http://i.imgur.com/mObQRwZ.gif)

[Image Source](http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=464152)

As you can see, a higher field of view gives the world depth. When you are at a low FOV, the world appears flat and you have no peripheral vision. It's like a horse with blinkers on, you can only see what's directly in front of you unless you physically turn your head, or in this case move your mouse. It's an incredibly disorienting experience for some gamers; many PC gamers playing at low FOV report experiencing headaches, or in extreme cases nausea from extended sessions. 

I know some people are probably calling B.S. at this point, but there's a reason this happens primarily to PC gamers. 

When playing on a console, lower FOV is typically not an issue because you tend to sit further away from your visual display, while PC gamers tend to be directly in front of their monitors. By being further away, you are getting the necessary sense of depth because you have the real world still in your field of view, so the lower FOV settings do not impact you as much. Here's a visual representation of how that works:

[Image](http://i.imgur.com/NrNYr.png)

[Image Source](http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=464152)

You can see in the above image why PC gamers would be disoriented. Instead of retaining your sense of peripheral vision like you would sitting further away from your monitor, you are in a sense experiencing simulated tunnel vision. The higher FOV helps compensate for this, giving you a sense of depth to the world and negating the physical effects of experiencing depth on a flat display.

**Why is it like this in Defiance?**

I cannot speak for why Trion has the game presented in this way, however I can make inferences based on my (limited) knowledge of field of view. We all know this game has two console versions working, so it's entirely likely this is an oversight on the part of Trion. However, there are other issues that can result in low FOV settings. Increasing your field of view means the game client renders more game assets at once. This means you are demanding more from your GPU in each frame, which means lower performance. Since consoles are notorious for having weak hardware, FOV is capped to provide a consistent performance across all consoles. Having a lower FOV means you can provide higher quality art assets than if you had a higher FOV.

**What can Trion can do about this?**

It's actually really simple for most game engines, it's literally a variable change. Being able to access the developer console would likely result in a solution in a matter of minutes. Trion could go the extra mile and implement an FOV slider in the settings menu that would allow players to choose their FOV settings. This would mean that players who are okay with the current FOV settings would not see any change, but those who value our sanity would be able to see the world around us without wanting to gouge our eyes out. A simple ability to go from the current minimum (likely in the 60-75 range) to a capped maximum (110 is usually more than enough) would be ideal."	t5_2siko	True

I put most of it together the week of launch and updated bits and pieces since then, I haven't found another source like it but would like to put this out somehow.

Is it just too much? Should I just edit a wiki page or something instead? Is it just not useful given the limited depth of defiance?

Spending points effectively decreases your Reputation. I wish that your Reputation and vendor points/currency/whatever you want to call it were separate. IE By completing a contract, a player would receive 10/50 Points to spend, and at the same time earn 10/50 Reputation Standing that did not decrease when you spent points to buy Faction Vendor items. 

Seven dailies a week at 10 points and one weekly at 50 points means a max of 120 points per Faction per week (assuming no server resets where the contracts also reset); roughly 6 weeks of patiently hoarding my hard earned points, just to complete a goal. 

Making me NOT do something in a game to earn rewards seems counter intuitive. I hope this helps anyone that was thinking about spending their hard earned points without reaching Trusted status beforehand."	t5_2siko	True

I've been noticing more and more a problem when my gun's mag runs out of ammo, and starts to reload the gun. It starts to look like I'm reloading the gun in the game, but it ends up just using a mag's worth of ammo, and the gun is still empty. 

For example, If my mag holds 25 rounds, and I have 100 rounds total. When I hit 0 rounds in the mag, the gun reloads 25 of the remaining 100 rounds, but then resets the gun to 0 round in the mag, and 75 left available for reloads. Then it goes to 0 and 50...then 0 and 25...then I'm out of ammo after only shooting 1 mags worth. 

Anyone else seeing this issue?

EDIT: Glad to know I'm not alone here. Lets all report this as a bug then. I've had a little luck working around this issue by swaping to my 2nd weapon then back to main weapon and reload then. Anyone else have workaround suggestions?

EDIT2: For the people having this issue - does it only happen on certain guns? I think it started to happen to me when I mod'd my first weapon for faster reload times. Maybe just guns with mod'd reload times are having this issue? I need to check my guns tonight to verify this theory.

**Salvage Matrix**

* When breaking down an item, allow us to select multiple items at a time.
* Allow us to see our Gulanite quantity in our inventory. 

**Loadout**

* When trying to modify, sell, do anything with an item that has defaulted itself to your additional loadouts. Allow us to either be prompted to remove item from all loadouts with a confirmation, or allow us to 'clear' the loadouts we aren't using.  
* (more of a bug)  Random EGOs ""fall off"" the perk tree and require to be re-equip.

**Inventory**

* Allow us to 'mark' items that we are wanting to keep for whatever reason.  These items are then sorted to the top of your inventory or stored in a separate tab within your inventory (still counting as inventory though).  *Once you have 60+ inventory capacity and you are keeping your legendaries, mods, sentimental guns it get annoying.* 
* Stash or Bank to store things potentially accessible to Clan / Friends / Alternates.
* When the inventory is brought up, all new items acquired since the last time should show an indication of being new to the inventory. [Beaunuts]

**Pursuits**

* Pursuit tracker, allow us to track 1-2 pursuits that we may be working on actively.
* Better interface, maybe showing you which you have completed, or the %.  [WolfintheShadows]

**HUD**

* (more of a bug) I know I have 7 co-op missions, and no they aren't new content anymore. No I am no longer level 200, or 260, or 540. Those pop-ups occur anytime you log in / zone in anywhere.
* Colorblind support (red/green). When the crosshairs turn red over a mob, it disappears into the green void. [Cyprex]

**Chat System**

* Better VoiP options - have on for PvP, but not PvE.  Push-to-talk.  Keybind to toggle.
* Chat system that is visible and easy to use.

**Map**

* Allow us to filter the legend.  (Maybe I just want to see all the Racing missions).
* Custom Waypoint that stay on map until removed.  I would like to permanently mark the hidden vendors, good jump places to complete pursuits, things like that.  
* Fast Travel being more prominent on the map or redesigned so you're not clicking on vendors instead of fast travel [NoNameForSteve]
* Timers for events so you know if its worth traveling to participate [WolfintheShadows]
* Group / Clan waypoints [alexiib]

**Lock-box Vendors**

* A static vault key for easier mass purchase, or a quantity option. [donoftheslum]

**PC**

* Provide PC players with more hotkey and keybinding customizations since this platform has that availability [donoftheslum]

**Controls**

* Provide more customization for controls in specific situations (i.e. mouse sensitivity controls for non-scope vs scope) [donoftheslum]
* Toggle of certain in-game functions such as the 180 lock on things attacking you from behind [NoNameForSteve]

**Vehicle** 

* A pebble doesn't cause your vehicle to instantly stop or shoot you straight up 30 feet.

1365439823.0	1bxddp	Getting Started in Defiance	acefisher1	15	1	28	"I noticed a lot of people having some of the same issues I was when I first started playing Defiance. I didn’t have any pre-amble, or beta time with this game, and jumped in cold-turkey on the story and gameplay. I’ve written down my thoughts on some ways to do things I feel the best way. You may disagree, and that’s fine, but these are my tips. Use them as you like, and don’t use the ones you don’t like! Have fun and let me know if there’s anything I need to elaborate on further, or you feel like deserves a  better explanation.  

Learning to play Defiance is a bit of a task. There is very little in the way of “real world tutorialization” in
the world of Defiance. I’m going to post a few points I feel would have really helped me out when I started the 
game. 

The top thing I see players doing wrong in Defiance is a big deal. 
**Don’t shoot the Skitterlings around arkfalls (the little crab looking hellbugs).**They open tears in the shards (big glowing crystal thing in the center of the arkfall) that you can then damage the shard through.

**Use your EGO Power!!!!** I can’t stress this enough. This power should be used the second it becomes available every time it’s up. This is your tide turner, escape mechanic, or breathing room creator. I know some of you will say that you like to save your cloak for escaping from a fight, but honestly if you utilize it properly, you won’t need to escape, you’ll have already won the fight. If you have **Overpower** on, target fire the highest-priority target, also be sure to empty your magazine before hitting Overpower, as it reloads your weapon instantly. If you have **Cloak**, use the time to reload, reposition, and prioritize your targets. **Blur**, reposition yourself, get somewhere you need to be, this power is the weakest in my opinion, and is mostly useful in melee builds, which I’m not sure are quite viable yet, but on the way. **Decoy** users should take the opportunity the decoy provides to target fire enemies that are priorities or reload and reposition. This ability is a huge advantage and can change the tide of a battle. Be sure to be conscious of other players and keep in mind that this ability will make most enemies go the direction of the decoy.

**Items in your inventory cannot be dropped, destroyed, sold, or broken down for materials until they are removed from EVERY loadout slot** in your loadouts screen. This is a very common issue I see players complaining about, and it’s a simple fix, but a frustrating problem nonetheless.  

**On the road again. Use the road!** The game has an unfortunate failing when it comes to traversing the map with your ATV, Charger, or Dune Buggy. Any rough edge will send you spiraling into a tree, rock, or unlikely pebble, and you’ll find yourself turned the wrong way or vertical on a tree truck in no time. Use the road, boost like theres no tomorrow. Drain that boost every chance it’s filled. Just set a waypoint (right click a spot on the map on PC) and follow the main road around, and you’ll be anywhere in under 2 minutes. The longest drive I’ve dealt with was about 3 minutes using only roads. 

**Take the time to go to every market spot on the map when you’re nearby for any reason** until you’ve unlocked the fast travel spot at that location. It’s unbelievably important to have all the fast travel spots so that when an arkfall begins across the map you can instantly travel nearby to it and be there to start running that damage meter up. The fast travel spots show up as blue arrows. Don’t leave the camp until you see it show up on the map, it’s a bit touchy, so run around the camp and have a look around. There are some funny signs to take in.

**Do a lot of Arkfall events**. Every time you do a story mission, go do 3-5 Arkfalls, with at least one of them 
being a major arkfall. These give the most meaningful rewards of anything in the game. They take a bit of time, but you get weapons, experience, and currency that are amongst, if not the most, efficient method of getting these things in the game currently. As it should be, you are an Ark Hunter by trade after all. 

**Salvage items, don’t sell them**. The lowest level salvage is 250, and averages closer to 500. If you find yourself with a full inventory, you need to stop and salvage every item you aren’t using in a loadout. Find a weapon setup that works for you for each loadout, and stick with it. You level up weapons and thus, should continue to use the same ones for long periods of time. Only keep items in your inventory if they are actively used frequently. Certain items can always be broken down instantly. The second I get any bio-std grenade types (slowdown mechanic, little to no damage), I break them down into salvage. You’ll get enough in-game currency through missions and challenges to buy anything you need. **The only time you should be selling items** is for a couple reason; one, the item is worth upwards of 1,000 credits early in the game. Or two, there is a specific item you want to buy, such as a vehicle or costume item. The salvage is the important currency in this game. 
	
Don’t worry about buying items from vendors. There is the occasional upgrade that boosts you a few points, but 
overall the vendors sell bad weapons, at much too high prices. You have a better chance of getting worthwhile 
weapons from lockboxes. You can be more efficient by killing off lots of enemies and looting bad weapons to
 break down to salvage and then buying keys. 

	
**Try a bunch of different weapons**. Don’t be afraid to give something a shot. There is a key here though. Not every weapon works well in every scenario. You’ll have access to two load outs fairly early on in the game, by the time you do the first 2-3 story missions actually. I have a loadout for fighting mutants, and then I have a loadout for hellbugs and arkfalls. Some weapons work differently even within the same class as one another. Be careful to pay attention if a sniper rifle fires one very powerful shot, or two quick weaker shots. This is a huge difference, and will change the way it should be used.  
	
**Pick up every item that drops**. If it isn’t useful (and few things you pick up will be) **you can immediately break it down for salvage**, which you can use to buy keys to turn into weapons through lockboxes.

  	 
**When you get bored doing something, go do something else**. This seems obvious, but it’s easy to get caught up in the loop of running from one arkfall to the next, or falling into the story missions and feeling obligated to keep going. You can stop doing anything, anytime, and go do a random side mission, time challenge, or hotshot. Go do something random! Everything has rewards in this game. The least rewarding of all of these are the time trials, and the most lucrative are the side missions.  
	
**Explosive weapons for hellbugs; machine guns for mutants. This is my mantra, and my guide.**
Shotguns can be used for both these applications. Explosive weapons tend to have too low of an ammo count, 
and reload time for dealing with groups of mutants. The big’uns included. A we placed elemental burst to a
Mutant Chain Gunner’s melon will melt him faster than a barrage of detonator rounds any day. Even when you’re 
spec’d towards explosives like I am. Get a group of mutants together and drop a grenade into the pack. They’ll 
be weakened and go down easily under a hail of machine gun fire or shotgun pellets. **Elemental weapons are king when it comes to Mutants**. Fire and forget with a volley from your burning status effect assault rifle or SMG and take cover while they burn to death and you have a quick smoke behind that barrel. 
 
**Carry a gun in one of your loadouts to deal with strong single enemies**. There is almost always one very powerful or at least highly powered enemy in every pack of enemies that are worth fighting. It’s important to have a strong weapon for single-target fire to deal with them, or you can be in a situation you aren’t able to win in, and will have run away. Big enemies have a higher item drop rate than weaker ones. Explosive Grenades are also a great way to deal with powerful opponents.

I remember around those times hearing about Trion's next big project, an MMOFPS universe running alongside a TV show. I naturally assumed this wouldn't see the light of day anytime soon and put it to the back of my mind.

Then luckily I stumbled across Defiance a few weeks back, and after checking out the youtube vids was shocked at just how polished the whole project felt. Then realizing the game is releasing in April, that hype train excietment started to set in!

I've been watching the show and I really enjoy the universe and characters. I've had my eye on the game but heard there were many bugs, hackers and overall it was just ""meh"". I'd be grateful if you guys could answer some questions like:

* What do you guys like about the game and what don't you like?

* Does it have replayability or once you beat the story there is no real endgame to keep working towards?

* Does it tie in well with the show like they say in the commercials? Does the game spoil anything that may come in future episodes?

* Are there any major bugs or common hacking?

Reasons why I made such decision:
- No chat
- Way too many bugs, specially with Decoy, I ended up trapped into Houses, underground countless times. Tbh I don't know how this kind of bugs made to Alpha + 3 CBTs.
- Voice perma active, in PvP is so annoying people just shouting (Don't even know if I can mute 1 by 1 or if all I can do is to mute global)
- Not really many players, most of the quests I did, were solo, even on those ""Rifts"" i tried to do 4 of them, I found ppl only once.
- No falling damage, pretty weird stuff, specially in PvP, you hit someone once, and he just jumps down the building it's fine!

Quick sum up of issue for me;
When using bolt action sniper rifle for ages all of a sudden started getting no damage, as in I would see the damage numbers, but the enemies would take no damage, not even notice the shot. (only on headshots, body shots work fine, but who wants this?!)
Anyways i sold that rifle got a new one, same issue. I removed mods from this second rifle as I noticed it came with a scope'd mode (noticed in previous threads they said this was the issue, it is a SIMILAR issue, not the same).
Then strangest of all, my friend was using a sniper rifle head-shotting with no issues getting full damage etc, he traded it to me and I still had the same issue.
I began thinking what caused this specifically to me, he showed me a youtube video for Arkfall no damage glitch that was affected by cluster grenades so i changed my grenades (they weren't cluster ones anyway). Still the same issue, then I removed my perks and added them one by one etc. Found out what caused this issue.

&gt;Hello!

&gt;Thank you for contacting us regarding Defiance.
&gt;
&gt;I see that you've regained control of your account and taken measures to help safeguard it against further intrusions. I'm happy to let you know that I've removed the suspension from your account and you should now be able to access your account normally. If purchases were made and refunded on the payment method tied to your account, we would definitely recommend contacting your card provider to go through the fraudulent charge process with them.

&gt;Unfortunately at this time, we do not have character backups for Defiance, and we were unable to restore your character to the exact way it was before the intrusion on your account.Due to this restriction in our tools, we have gone ahead and awarded your character with several items based on your EGO rating, restored your Scrip to the amount it was previously, as well as Lockbox compensation which will award you with possible epic or legendary items. We hope that this compensation will allow you to continue to progress through Defiance without any further issues. Thank you for your patience in regards to this matter.

&gt;If you have any additional questions or concerns then please don't hesitate to let us know. Thank you for your continued support of Trion Worlds and for playing Defiance. Your reference number for this question is XXXXX-XXXXX

Is this type of support-focused spec redundant with all the healing options available to all players?

What if the writers/producers/Bear insist on closing an episode with a cover song because, in a way it symbolizes how the people of Defiance long for the days of old - before everything went to shtako???

Holding on to memories (through song), but continuing on and sharing these memories/identities with the new generation and new friends. Much like the St. Louis arch, each closing song is a hint of something familiar (from the past) but with a new twist. *Hey, things are different now and life can be hard. But we've all traveled this road before. And life will move on.*

Heh, my apologies if anybody else has brought this to attention. I just thought I'd share my appreciation. Maybe it was this week's episode and its closing cover/songs that inspired me to write this up (in other words, it was really good).

Arkfalls are cool, but they aren't diverse enough and I felt myself wanting big raider arkfalls or 99er arkfalls. As far as I know, there were no small Dark Matter arkfalls whatsoever, which was disappointing. 

Like I said, I love the game, but I'm around EGO level 1200, and the game isn't much fun for me anymore. I know they did the hellbug events, but the random events on the road get boring.

I feel like the show is outlasting the game, and the awesome new-game feel is starting to wear off. Is anyone else having this problem? I don't want to make another character, I always hated doing that in games. Scrip is totally useless so it's no use trying to save that up, and weapons are pretty balanced so trying to get the best weapon ever isn't that big of a priority.

I want to get the pursuit for getting 50,000 kills, but at the moment I'm at roughly 16,000 and I don't see myself getting close any time soon. Anyone have any ideas for something to do? I haven't been playing it hardly at all lately, and the last time I played it I was bored in about 10 minutes.

Any ideas would be appreciated. "	t5_2siko	True

&gt;Hello ***,

&gt;Thank you for contacting us regarding Defiance.

&gt;Unfortunately, we don't support support use of third party programs and we recommend to use the game as intended. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused and we certainly understand your desire to improve the game experience by using macros.

&gt;If you have any additional questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to let us know. Thank you for your continued support of Trion Worlds and for playing Defiance.

&gt;Your reference number for this question is 130414-001710.

&gt;Sincerely,


&gt;Trion Worlds Inc.

And my original question:

&gt;Hello,

&gt;I was wondering if you could please clarify on whether keyboard ""macros"" such as those generated by Logitech G510 keyboards are allowed within the game. I would like to make salvaging items easier to do on PC but obviously don't want to get banned.

&gt;Thanks!

Here's a link to the Skill Calculator, courtesy of donoftheslum!:

http://defiance-central.com/ego-calculator/

For me personally, I'm an Ark Hunter through and through. So this is the loadout I'm using most of the time:

[I call my build ""The Diversion."" Here's a link to it.](http://defiance-central.com/ego-calculator/?link=2c-3a-4a-5c-12d-21c-31a-41c-&amp;start=12)

*Note: I just put enough points to get the four main perks I'm able use. But at 461 you'll have many more points to put into perks. Just pick whatever you want really*

**EGO 461**

* Decoy (**Perks:** Pumped Up, Materialize, Effecient Projection, and Self-Medicated)
* 3 Round Burst AR, unscoped
* Ground Pounder
* Respark Shield - 1051, 40% RS, 2.85 delay,
* Frag Grenade 

Play style is just to shoot everything with the AR and switch to the Ground Pounder for Monarchs.

Decoy to distract enemies. Whether it be to go revive someone or just take the heat off of you so you can regain your shields.

That's my main build. I haven't put much thought into it but it sees me consistently getting top 3 in Arkfalls.

I'd love to see some builds using the other 3 EGO powers. Because I have no idea how to properly play them. "	t5_2siko	True

I have two questions, which I will put in two different Comments.
Question 1: Which NPC, besides Nolan and Irisa, have the most chance to make the transition to the TV Show in the future? 
Question 2 - Beyond Arkfalls,  can we expect large-group instanced Raid Content similar to typical MMOs in the near future?

&gt;Nathan Richardsson (Ennsta)

&gt;Right now the focus is on more dynamic co-op game modes in the open world rather than instances. It's something we'd like to do though and this is very often asked.

Xavier Horovitz

Hey Defiance dudes! I've got two questions for you. I hope I'm allowed to do that!
Question One: As a guy who really loves the aspect of clans in an MMO, do you have any further plans to branch the system out? Customized ranks in the clan with modifiable powers, instanced clan bases with a shared bank access and some clan PvP would really be awesome! 
Question Two: Has there been any talk about bringing Defiance to the next generation of consoles? With the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 on their way out the door for many gamers, it seems to me that the playerbases would begin to dwindle as many players upgraded consoles. I don't know the logistics, of course, but having shared servers would be remarkable. That is to say, a shared server between the PS3/PS4 as well as a shared server between the 360/Next Xbox. In short, the lack of a next-gen plan will spell doom for the consoles versions of Defiance.

&gt;Nathan Richardsson (Ennsta)
&gt;
1. Yes, very much, to the point of having Clan progression, Clan warfare and shared benefits (banks, bases, boosts, spandex wardrobe).
&gt;2. Yes, yes and yes. We're as interested as the rest of the world in the next generation of consoles and for us, like you point out, this is very much just another platform for the Defiance client to be on and a natural progression. Stay tuned.

spartan1124

What are your plans for an enhanced crafting system? Will we see one someday, or is that not on the roadmap?
 
&gt;Nathan Richardsson (Ennsta)
&gt;
It is indeed very much on the roadmap.

aydenpride

In defiance will end game content show up where a skilled group of players take down instanced bosses much like your co-op maps but on a larger scale of 10 or more players? Also any chance of a loot table being present in only these raids and not outside with the exception of maybe lock boxes?

&gt;Lance James (Myll_Erik)

&gt;For bigger battles - its a fun idea, but nothing confirmed. On exclusive loot - seems like it could be fun. 
  
&gt;Nathan Richardsson (Ennsta)

&gt;Yes we've thought about larger co-op instances (ie raids) and wrt loot tables, we do separate loot by activity and you will see that far more in the upcoming new features and content.

RubenAlonzo

Any thoughts on player housing in the future or being able to mod our vehicles?

&gt;	Lance James (Myll_Erik)

&gt;	We have thoughts - yes :) 

&gt;	Nathan Richardsson (Ennsta)

&gt;	I wub housing personally and we have a lot of ideas but first things first.

Zizone

1. Will there be more Graphical option's... since the game was set for consol the pc version is so naked compared to other pc games.. so will we be getting more Options for graphics higher and lower end machines really want to know!

&gt;Nathan Richardsson (Ennsta)

&gt;Yes, they are on their way!

Wyrdoli

Will it be possible for User created characters (assuming the name is not nonsense) to be able to enter the tv show in some form? either their deeds mentioned or even winning some kind of walk on part?

&gt;Nathan Richardsson (Ennsta)

&gt;Yes, we'd like to see more of that in the future but technologically, simply not possible in the current season.

AloneChief

1: What kind of new content can we expect in the future for Defiance? Since you released a season pass, what will happen for those that does'nt own the season pass.
2: There have been some complaints that the UI for the PC is a bit weird to get used to IF you don't play with a controller, will we see an updated PC UI?
3: One of your biggest selling points of the game is that it's connected to the TV series, that they will affect eachother. You mention that in the future,  players might turn up in the series but how is these players selected? Is it by accomplishments, fame or other? (I also hope we only get to see people with ""serious"" names in the series, not a person namned Trollface McGee)

&gt;Nathan Richardsson (Ennsta)

&gt;1. 5 DLCs are planned, they all have a free component and a paid component. Our strategy is to not segregate the playerbase whenever possible. We want you to play together. So a DLC has free components which is essentially content so everyone can play together and the paid components are more unlocking abilities or features combined with items and such. Imagine introducing a new playable species. To be able to play the species you need to buy that ability either through the store or through a DLC. To access the associated content, you don't have to pay anything.
&gt;2. Yes you will, constantly.
&gt;3. http://www.cad-comic.com/cad/20130401 - you'll see it more in the future. Legally, this has to be very accomplishment driven but ""fame and other"" is never ruled out. Surprise me.

QuasarZ71

Do you plan on a tracking system for goals? I would like to track the progress of episode goals without going into the menu and goals. 
 
&gt;Lance James (Myll_Erik)m

&gt;Currently thats the only thing we have planned - are you wanting another menu or a better menu?

jay100

i would like to see a radial menu for quick change loadouts for us console players would be very useful also i dont know if it is meant to be this way but i would like to have the opt to use the same grenade and shield mods on other loadouts as of now it wont let you

&gt;Nathan Richardsson (Ennsta)

&gt;We'll be constantly improving usability of the UI, including platform specific, there is a team constantly  to UI. The PC is hurting the most right now.

Amesiel

For a game like this, how come Cross Plataform wasn't available?  i think it would have been great to be able to play with players from PS3, Xbox And PC all together.

&gt;Nathan Richardsson (Ennsta)

&gt;That isn't possible due to a number of policies and restrictions.

&gt;Technically it's no problem. You can connect with any client to the same Defiance server. It's how all our internal servers are set up for testing.

Jailbirdym

1) Any chance on pets or personal bots for our guys (or gals)?
2) Is there a time we could ""game with the Stars of the show""? (Nat and Lance excluded- lol)
3) Have you guys licensed a CCG or miniatures game yet?
4) Will you have more Holiday themed events in game?
 
&gt;Nathan Richardsson (Ennsta)

&gt;1. Yes, but far out.
&gt;2. Yes, we had that in Beta, Grant played himself (Nolan). We'll see what happens.
&gt;3. Nope. 
&gt;4. Yes!

Legnirm

1. Is there going to be a Free Trial of the game 14 days or so, To try out before buying it. I mostly play MMO's and have been looking for a new one to play.
2. How big is Endgame PvE and how much and fast to you expect to expand it. Patch/DLC every month every 3 months or so. 
3. Guild Support is the main Feature in mmo's (imo). Do Guilds have ""levels"" Perks, Guild Banks. Guild vs. guild PvP. If not are plans to add this or do some more stuff around that.
 
&gt;Nathan Richardsson (Ennsta)

&gt;1. Could certainly happen but I wouldn't wait for it.
&gt;2. It's about this big (---------------------------------------------------------------------)

&gt;We have 5 DLCs planned before Season 2 goes out.

&gt;3. No but they will have.

villhest

Can you please enable custom / advanced graphics settings for the PC version? Like draw-distance, anti-aliasing etc.? I feel like my machine could squeeze a lot more out of it!

&gt;Nathan Richardsson (Ennsta)

&gt;It's on it's way.

rzgamer

This might sound like an odd thing to request, but I really liked it in Rift where you could /tweet from your twitter account from the game.  Any thoughts on social features like that?

&gt;Lance James (Myll_Erik)

&gt;Yes! We want that + better streaming stuff to help you folks!

Amesiel

When will the Capture and Hold PVP Instance be activated again?
 
&gt;Lance James (Myll_Erik)

&gt;Soon - we're working out a few unforeseen bugs that came up. 

jvice

i'm  member of a very large outfit in planetside 2, are there any limitations of ""clan"" size in game and if so are there any plans on increasing them to accomidate potentially very large guilds playing? ( 666 devil dogs 4k members) 
 
&gt;Lance James (Myll_Erik)

&gt;Currently our clan system isn't quite everything we were hoping it would be - but that's one of our big things we are working to improve. We want people to play with friends and more importantly make it meaningful. 

XxMeRcY_MaCaBrExX

Will there be any melee weapons released in the game.

&gt;Lance James (Myll_Erik)

&gt;Melee weapons are some of the trickiest weapons to balance - they have to be good enough to get in close, but not too good that they kill everything. Never say never! 

MidnightMeteor

Will be ever get to play as Dark Matter orget their vehicles? Perhaps even the awesome flying one?

&gt;Lance James (Myll_Erik)

&gt;Flying vehicles - not sure. For playing as the Dark Matter, you'll have to keep playing to find out.

rookangelofmercy

do u think there will ever be a 'barber shop' or account bank in the game?

1) Do not exit the game. This will cause you to randomly lose one of your equipped items.

The crystal from Nolan and Irissa was a nice little bit. The ""Launching the cure"" mission (which I'm too weak to complete atm) seems pretty

1370718249.0	1fxttd	Siphon: Is It Too Strong?	Beastmister	13	3	27	"Rawr Ark Hunters, Beastie here again!

I've had a gripe with the siphon nano effect and wanted to gather some communal discussion on it.  This discussion is going to have  bias against the nano effect and I can't help that, but after doing some probability research on different weapon types I've come across some startling results.  This being, above all else, that the siphon nano effect is essentially deadlier than your run-of-the-mill shotgun cloakers.  Here's why:

* The siphon nano deals 463 damage on a proc, with no way to reduce this damage.  Rear guard, cellular armor, etcetera all seem to have virtually no effect.  If a perk were introduced to counteract this it would be much less of an issue, however that is currently not the case.
* Shotguns used to be the king of siphon effects with a high proc rate per pellet, but have recently been trumped by the SMG class.  SMGs in particular carry approximately a 4-5% flat proc rate, with various ways to improve this.  **Tachmag pulsers in particlar have the ability to proc twice in one second on average.**
* In comparison to the above point, the VOT Blast Rifle with a rate of fire +20/sec to the Tachmag Pulser carries a much lower proc rate, at almost 1%.  These numbers are rough, but I've found a very large skew in the nano rates that doesn't ring balance.
* Siphon's damage output is vastly greater than any other nano effect save possibly radiation, however the reliability of it far trumps rads.  Since fire does not stack and bio is a tactical effect, siphon is the end-all-be-all for straight up combat.  Not even mentioning, it heals the user.
* Siphon has no falloff damage.  This is absurd.  Snipers are currently outclassed by anyone with a Tachmag because it's just so easy to spam the nano, even if your bullets only deal 10% damage.
* It's been said that nano effects were given a cap in PvP of proccing only *x* times per second, however I've yet to find any concrete evidence that this affects any play.  Is there further research on this I'm not seeing?

**TL;DR**, it's my honest opinion that the siphon nano should be greatly reduced in damage, perhaps being a coefficient of the weapon's damage instead of a flat amount.  I don't disagree with it's reliability on **most** guns, but some seem to have a far greater nano effect chance than should be allowed.  There is a problem here and the developers over at Trion have mentioned that they are balancing issues, but have given no insight into siphon work.  In conclusion, I do believe *all* of the nano effects should be reworked with the exception of bio, since it's right where it should be in tactical use.  Siphon, however, just feels like the highest priority.

What's your opinion, Ark Hunters?"	t5_2siko	True
1370440993.0	1fpytt	PVP: Turret Kills Daily Contract Breaks Freight Yard	YuriPup	10	1	20	"Yesterday I failed to do the Echelon daily contract and noticed it was just ruining Freight Yard PVP. 

The contract, get 10 turret kills in Capture and Hold, makes my team-mates my competitors and gets in the way of what should be the most important goal of PVP--winning the match. 

There are, at most, 4 turret seats available in a 32 person match. There is no way to queue for the seats, other than to stand around, out of combat, waiting for the vehicle to spawn. 

So if I want to complete the contract I likely have to harm my team by passively camping for a Cerberus seat (and camping is just bad game design these days), bored, while harming my team by not, you know, actually playing the game. 

Then I have to hope the team mate (read sucker) who drives the Cerberus doesn't get me killed and that I actually have a chance to kill some reds. Once I have inflicted this circle of harm and boredom on myself and my team mates, I can get angry with them for camping the Cerberus and not helping win the game. "	t5_2siko	True

**Edit 2**: So I've taken some advice, and finally found out that perks have to be equipped (this game does fuck all for explaining a lot of features), and my survivability has increased quite a bit. Getting used to decoy is going to take a bit, since I've been using cloak, but it has been helping. I've also switched to a Respark shield, from an Ironclad, and that seems to be helping too.

The question I have: is there anything that can actually counter shotguns, other than using a shotgun yourself? Theoretically you would make sure to stay at mid to long range and use an SMG/AR/LMG/pistol, but this doesn't work for a number of reason.

1. Shotguns are actually quite accurate even at middle ranges.
2. The map layouts have a tendency to force you into close quarters--large amounts of cover and tight hallways, very little open ground.
3. Cloak. It basically obviates the need for clever positioning or sneaking and removes the ability to play defensively.

So I ask you fellow players, if you were going to try to get someone to play the game, what would you show them? What jaw dropping screenshot would you pull out?

-----

There is one aspect of progression I am still a little fuzzy on, though... leveling up your weapons.  In addition to the bonuses you get for weapon types, it appears as though individual weapons can also be leveled up.  From what I can tell, each weapon can only be leveled up once... but doing so unlocks a hidden bonus.  This process is shown on the item card itself as an experience bar below the mod slots.

For example, yesterday I leveled up two weapons... a SMG and an assault rifle.  The SMG gained 6% bonus damage when I am below the target.  The AR gained 6% bonus damage from behind.  

It's not an altogether quick process to level a weapon up, so I'm hoping someone out there has done a bit more thorough investigation on the subject to be able to answer the following two questions:

* First and foremost, are these bonuses completely random... or are they built into the item itself (either by type (SMG, Shotgun, etc...) or specific model of gun (VBI Assault Rifle, etc..?)  If no one known, I think I'll try to figure it out today. **Tested!  Bonuses are completely random.  That should make things pretty interesting, economy-wise.**

* Is this leveling based on damage done, or experience gained?  I am almost leaning towards the former, as it feels like automatics gain exp much, much faster than something like a shotgun or launcher. **Tested!  Experience is based on damage dealt, and does not include melee damage dealt with the gun.**"	t5_2siko	True

When i broke down my weapon, i gained 250 salvage and in my inventory, i had 2 lvl 1 mods for assault rifles. Is this normal, a bug, or did i miss something?

1373478179.0	1i0r9f	A theory on how the ancient Votan ship came to earth, and why the Votanis Collective came here as well.	sg1jacksonsg1	15	7	39	"Alrighty. So most of us, by now, have seen the season finale for the show, and it has left a lot of questions unanswered. If you haven't seen the final episode yet, STOP READING NOW AND GO WATCH IT! Also there are going to be a bunch of spoilers coming up, and I don't want to ruin it for all of you.

So what we know so far: 

- Votanis Collective left their system to escape extinction.
- Arks left around 5000 years ago.
- After the events of the episode 12, we find out there is an ancient Votan ship
  in the Gulanite mines under Defiance.
- We also find out that the Indogene have been looking for this ancient ship
  for about 3000 years.

Now onto my theory.

When the Votanis Collective were building the Arks, they needed a way to make sure the passengers and the ships systems were being maintained properly. Thus arose the Ark Brains. Now, with early experimentation by the Indogene, they were able to create an AI, and integrate it into a ship. What they then decided to do was use this ship as a unmanned drone to scout the galaxy for another habitable planet, that they could terraform. Once it was sent out the Indogene did not consider how quickly the AI would learn and adapt. It eventually, found a way to develop its own version of FTL, and then jumped away to complete it's mission. Eventually it found Earth, landed, started broadcasting it's signal that it found a suitable world, and then waited until it was found.

Now 5000 years is a very long time to wait. As the AI waited it started to become more and more self-aware. Learning, adapting, and eventually developing a feeling that it's creators had abandoned it.

In the meantime, the Indogene created the Ark Brains from their experiments with AI technology. They equip the ships with these new ""contained"" Ark Brains, and get ready to launch. Now they were unable to figure out where the AI ship went, but they knew which direction it was heading. They loaded up the ships, and lied to the Votanis Collective leaders and said they found a suitable planet to terraform, and they left.

The journey took about 5000 years to get from the VC planets to Earth. About 2000 years or so into it, the Ark Brains aboard the ships picked up a faint signal from our sector of space, and it was the AI ship that went rogue. On each ship, the Ark Brains woke up an Indogene scientist to periodically check the signal, and try to find this ship. They eventually arrive at Earth, but it has been so long that life had evolved, and a civilization emerged. The AI ship had been buried under thousands or years of the planet's environment changing, and now there is a city interfering with the ships signal which has all but died out after being active for so long.

So, that's it. That is why I believe the Votanis Collective came to Earth. Now for the reason the Indogene are looking for it, that is sort of self explanatory. If there is a ship's AI that has evolved to the point that it can build it's own version of FTL, then who knows what it is capable of.

**TL;DR**  The ship under Defiance has a powerful AI that became self-aware, and the Indogene want to find it because it can kill everything on the planet if it wanted to.

Please discuss,and let me know what you all think of this theory."	t5_2siko	True

I started playing Defiance and was wondering some questions:

1. What are the best EGO powers (and perks too, if possible) for PvE and sporadic PvP (veeeery sporadic)? We are 2 person playing together and sometimes just myself.
We are using Decoy atm.

2. Is there any way to heal people? I saw few players spreading beams and apparently healing the rest.

3. Which weapons would you recommend for 2 newbies? Atm we are using shotgun + fast shoting one (sub machine, assault...).

4. Any tip for adding mods to weapons? When should I improve a weapon?

1372704248.0	1hfxnr	To Freshen Up Arkfalls	angeleus09	11	2	6	"These ideas came to me while I was replying over on [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Defiance/comments/1h8e50/the_game_is_good_but_it_feels_lacking_does_anyone/) but I thought I'd start a separate discussion on it to see what you guys thought.

Following the premise that Arkfalls are actually pieces of the destroyed Ark ships falling to Earth bearing mutated life forms and technology, and the common complaint that they look nothing like wreckage from a ship, then it seems like adding ship wreckage visuals would go a long way towards maintaining continuity with the lore of the world. 

But why stop there? Why not use the new presentation to offer loot in a more immersive and interesting way?

1. Minor Arkfalls - Shown as a group of small ship pieces that players can loot like chests after completing.
1. Major Arkfalls - Shown as a large piece of ship that the mobs burst out of. After completion, the ship remains as a structure players can enter which then becomes an instanced loot chamber.

The amount and quality of loot obtained from these lootable objects will depend on the player's performance during the event.

Example: out of 10 Ark pieces (Minor Arkfalls) or 10 lockers in the wreckage (Major Arkfalls), players in the top X% will find loot in all 10, players in the next X% will find loot in 7/10, then 4/10 and finally 1/10.

* To make it even more interesting, the different loot spots could be set to different qualities and then be filled randomly for players that aren't getting all 10 spots. So lockers 1-8 are white, 9-10 are green and the top X players have a chance for 10 to be blue. A player only getting 4 spots might get 1, 3, 6 and 8 (so three whites and one green) and a player getting only one spot might get 9 (one green).

On second thought, a more appropriate number might be 5 spots, that way Arkfalls don't overshadow lockboxes for loot quantity from a single source but provide more incentive to participate.

* __Inventory size__: Is the size of your inventory tied to your ego rating? If so, at what levels do we get more space? I'm at about 430 now and I have 28 inventory slots.

* __Ammo/loot drops__: From playing different styles during arkfalls (attacking only the crystal vs. killing hellbug warriors and archers) I'm starting to suspect that to get an enemy to drop anything you have to have done at least some damage to it. So if I'm only attacking the crystal I often run out of ammo because nothing is dropping ammo since I'm not hitting any enemies. Is this correct?

* __XP__: Often after an arkfall or an ""emergency"" there's a whole bunch of XXX xp things that pop up really quickly. What are those? Is that the xp from the kills that are all given at once at the end?

* __Groups__: A few times now I've casually formed a group with someone out in the world. If I'm the group leader can he see any waypoints I set? If I trigger a mission they've already completed do they get the cut scenes too? Can they interact with the mission objectives to complete them?"	t5_2siko	True

Please let me know what you think of the story and I look forward to posting part three when it's ready!*

**Cloud Ninety-Nine, Part 2:  The Chamber Man**

Wings buzzing louder than guns blaring, shouts and shrieks echoed the hazy battlefield all the while Thae was wrapt in her clip, counting the bullets one by one and drifting towards her comrades.  With a focused glare, eyes darted from target to target as her feet made precision steps to avoid pools hazardous with unknown electronics.  She was a walking bull’s-eye, not faltering in her regime.  There was no parallel for just how mathematical the veteran became in the midst of combat.

Yet still, with every gruesome bug become lifeless two more sprung from the mist.  They were fierce and coordinated, unlike any she’d seen that raid ark showers.  Hellbugs came in all varieties of attitude, from chaotic to lethargic to just rampant and insane, but all underlings were led by a greater hive mind and that was the advantage Thaeya exploited most.  Her pistol continued to pierce chitinous armor by the second as she analyzed what exactly pushed savagery into this caste of enemy.

She hadn’t been targeted yet beyond her scratch, but looking south at the blurry contour of EMC’s Bravo team there was an overwhelming count of three-to-one in the alien’s favour.  Thae then begrudgingly saw her empty vehicle getting pecked at by skitterlings, with a tire blown and scratches cascading the windshield the Irath went to save her charger from total eradication.  The sharp-toothed critters flung like rocks to the sling when they met her weapon’s rounds, and soon enough the vehicle was clear enough for her to vault in and grab rifle and receiver.

Something was off about the attack.  She knew orders to give but not the reasons behind them.  Like any smart command the soldier followed her brain over her curiosity.  She clipped on her receiver and scrambled for the right broadcast channel.

“Staff Sergeant Clancy, do you read?  This is Thaeya Balor, ark patrol unit Bravo is under heavy siege,” she called out to the static volume.  “Clancy, if you value your men here tell them to get the hell out of dodge.  Do not call ark patrol Foxtrot to the Golden Gate for assistance.  I repeat, do not send backup!”

In the midst of her warning Thae found herself a surprise of shattered glass done by one determined skitterling slamming her driver side window open.  The nuisance was quickly met with a bullet to the mouth, splattering its tiny nerve-clustered brain across nearby pavement.  She was too eager to hear a reply to brush the debris away, only praying that the channel wasn’t interrupted by some unseen incident outside of the misty battle.

“This is Staff Sergeant Clancy of the EMC Overpass region,” came an obscure reply on the broadcast.  “I acknowledge your mandate but I’ve got orders from superiors, Sixteen.  Foxtrot patrol is already on their way.”

Critters flocked to her car like piranha to their prey.  In a nervous twitch the woman fumbled her rifle’s magazine while trying to load and watched in a blank stare as it fell beside the gas pedal.  She knew Clancy well enough that he wouldn’t be stupid.  And she knew well enough that today wasn’t the day for things to go wrong.  In a deep breath Thae snatched her gun’s clip and locked it in, kicking open her door and calling out to the military frequency in hopes to straighten the man’s crooked command.

“Listen to me Clancy, you call off your squad and you do it now!  These bugs are flaying anything that smells human. They’ve already murdered my charger and if you don’t heed my order you’ll be down nine men,” on the note of her last words a trio of bugs screeched as they hit her hood with a clunk, ripping into the metal like cloth.
Thaeya cursed them away in the Irathient fashion with a foul swing of her heavy Votan rifle, sending the little ones flying into a surge of electrified puddles.  “These bugs aren’t here for the arkfall, Sergeant.  You know they’d be led by a brood mother and there’s no visual or radar sighting.  They’re zoned in on human pheromones; have your men get in that damn truck!”

The channel’s low static cut silent after her harsh demands.  Clancy closed the broadcast without a reply which meant one of two things, but either way she had her work set out for her caught between two tides of an outnumbered skirmish.  Raising rifle to shoulder and taking aim down sights, that’s when the chemical cocktail hit Thae’s bloodstream like a hammer to the bell.  Her reflexes pinpointed the smallest of movements against Bravo team’s silhouetted struggle, and in the fog her rifle rained true to sundering claws and chitinous limbs alike.

Snipers that had moments before saved her from a nasty gouge now had wounds of their own.  It wasn’t easy to tell, but the veteran watched as they limped closer to the hulking military truck.  Her comrade listened, and that was when she knew the best course of action.  Her plan was simple, but not simply executed.  Thaeya sprinted north to the nearest broken truck, finding a visual high point and rallying for attention.  

“Protect the humans, move them south!  There’s no time to fend off this horde if we want what’s ours!”

Pixelating into view from active camouflage, a cyberpunk Indogene filed in back ranks heard the call, responding with her own demands coupled with the boom of a charged Votan blast rifle.  “You heard the girl, wrangle up these cattle and move!”

Sade Fletcher, self-proclaimed badass with a superficial flare and timely ally to the Irath coordinator, in it for the technology that inevitably led to bountiful scrip.  Her most notable feature was an implanted crimson titanium eye plate that extended to the back of the cybernetic hunter’s scalp, flaring up in sharp fins.  Complete with renegade attire and four glaring metallic teeth of different hues, the Indogene didn’t particularly fit common expectance of her species.

“Hustle up, hustle, go!”  Waving her heavy weapon in hand like a shepherd’s cane, Sade caught attention of the flock but continued to bark orders for the sake of fun.

Like no time passed the entire group responded and understood her plan.  They gathered and marched in tow, leaving the bugs frenzied on vehicles left behind.  In the spirit of scorn many of the vile creeps were blasted away.  Still unsure why the attack came in such numbers with no hive mind to be seen, Thaeya jumped off the wrecked truck to meet her friend.

“You sure know how to treat people like Pow, Sade.”
Flashing a multi-colour toothed smirk, the young hunter slung rifle in hand over her shoulder.  “Yeah, they’re pretty much the same in some respects.  How’d you notice the bugs?”

“Without something big around to tell them what to do they sense threats and attack out of sync.  They’re not like a pride of Casti maulers,” Thae explained.

“And these ones were,” the other replied quizzically.  “So you pinpoint the threat and round everyone up to mix the scent—clever.”

Blazing lights from the front of the pack meant Thaeya’s precious car was riddled with holes before she had the time to drive it away.  The group hiked past, leaving her to grimace at what turned out to be a horrible parking spot.  Better a charger than a body, she thought, keeping in line but forcing a double take on the ruined machine and graveyard of skitterling bits surrounding it.

High beams slashed through the hazy field in a bright wave, the Titan was alive and rumbling.  Many hunters raised their weapons in response to the light, only to drop them in hand again when the blurry view came clear: parasites littered the outside of the vehicle like a living exoskeleton.  Little ones gnawed on the reinforced tires in vain and bloated archers hissed at seeing new humans.

Acidic pheromones flew at the clustered group, quickly dispatched midair from a number of precise shots.  In a hard roar a Sensoth from the front called the instruction, “light ‘em up!”

Blown away, evaporated, incinerated, and eradicated with the collective barrage the truck was soon left barren of alien invasion.  Barely scratched and still intact, hunters kept their weapons raised as they surrounded the military truck.  Everyone knew what the bugs were after by now but tension was still high because there was no answer as to why they acted in such a way.

Bravo team was nowhere to be seen, it had Thaeya on edge.  Her blast rifle was mounted standby at her shoulder and aimed at the Titan’s hulking back doors as the group readied to open it.  

Unfortunately, the truck was locked and trying to force it open would be a waste of ammo.  So, taking the best plan they had, she motioned for someone to get the driver’s attention and open it.

One rough and smug machinist took the liberty of stepping up to the driver side window for inspection.  Driver and passenger were inside, but that’s all he could tell through the tinted window.  He took a knock on the glass when given the mutual go-ahead by Sade’s impatient yelling and the tinted glass dropped.  Driver and passenger indeed, but it wasn’t the humans they were expecting to meet.

Mechanical hisses were the man’s last sounds as a bayonet cracked through armor, chest, and spine in a bloody mess.  “Bleed the weakling!”

That’s when Thaeya’s backup plan followed through, but not in the manner she’d hoped for.  The iron doors swung open with a screeching heave, revealing the hybridized beast of a mechanized miner.  Skin red and thick like a hellbug, caged in flawed wires and steel plating, it was difficult to discern if it even had a head with the iron labyrinth that took place of where one should be on a man. He leapt down in a weighty lurch, followed by nearly a dozen crazed Ninety-Niners with weapons raised in the back.  They were standing over the bodies of Clancy’s former Bravo team.

She had the same thing in mind as everyone else, but there was no time for questions.  “Blaze that gachica!”

The red metal hulk yelped some ungodly sound as pellets flattened against its skin.  It snatched an impromptu explosive from a bandolier strapped to its waist, scraping the sharp ball across its chest to unlatch the pin since bulky hands and the lack of a proper mouth were impossible alternatives.  Lobbing the shrapnel blast one direction and blindly charging in the other it walloped one of its assailants into a crash landing on the bridge’s edge.

“Chamber man, chamber man, pull out their bones!”

“Chamber man, make jelly out of their skulls!”

“Feed them to the pet-things, chamber man, chamber man!”

I would say lets do this and help them fix it. Not often devs are this eager to quash a bug...

1368519222.0	1eaxvj	Reputation level with factions is not based on current your current reputation	Endaline	8	3	6	"I might have missed a huge post explaining this already, but the last time I checked in on the topic the general consensus was that if you spend any of your reputation you are going to have to start from scratch. 

Without knowing there was a Persuit for gaining trusted I instantly started buying stuff when I hit Reliable and felt like an ass afterwards. Today I managed to get myself up to 300 again though and I noticed that my reputation turned from Reliable to Trusted even though it still said the requirement was 600 before that.

So there is as a matter of fact a hidden counter that determines when you gain faction levels and not the actual reputation you see listed. If this is old news then I am sorry for being late to the party, might also just be a fluke on my side.

2. I seem to be unable to see other peoples names. I see them ... well I have seen 3 I think. Is this a bug in the game?
3. Is the chat system really that hard to use? I have tried to talk a few times and have never seen someone else using it.
4. Are a large number of the quests and mobs Instanced? I have seen some people fighting nothing then die. When I try to go revive them I am unable to.
5. Is a clan worth while? There does not seem to be much to them.

It seems like EGO rating goes up by some amount periodically and doesn't seem to have any relationship with the XP bar. When the XP bar fills, is that when you get an EGO point? I'm usually so busy running and gunning that I don't pay attention to much besides my cooldowns and ammo. And does the XP bar relate to the actual EGO rating? How does one go about deliberately increasing it? I also want to make sure my rating isn't too low or anything, I feel awful squishy most of the times- I've only done the first or second mission in Sausalito and I'm at 320-ish EGO rating. 	t5_2siko	True
1365629462.0	1c3a65	"without classes, is there any ""individuality""?"	dharmabum1	9	2	15	"I just finished Bioshock Infinite and was considering picking this up, as I havent played a solid MMO since Star Wars Galaxies (not that there aren't any, I just haven't played them). SWG was the perfect MMO at one point. You could join a group to go Rancor-hunting, make camp in the middle of nowhere with a group of 50, explore Tattooine's player-made cities and shop in the player-run stores. You could even meet players who were strictly tradesmen, and yet they still made an impact on the game's economy, and the wealth of their guild (or whatever they were called). I'm getting a little off-point here (that game set a very high bar for MMOs for me). 

My only hangup with Defiance is that it seems like without classes there is no actual role to be played. I liked the teamwork involved in MMOs where everyone has a specialized skill they're known for, but from what I can tell it seems like everyone is just another gun-wielding soldier with some kind of special powers sprinkled in.

Having a plethora of gun mods and all that is cool but its not enough to differentiate between a guy who shoots stuff and another guy who shoots other stuff. With that said, I'll admit I probably didn't research the game as much as I should, so please someone tell me I'm wrong because this seems like it would be a fun game otherwise.

Whores_anus	10	1	7	I have been playing the game for a while now, and when I started playing, I decided to go for a different approach (nearly all the videos of game play I've seen had either cloak or overcharge) and went with blur. However, this now seems like a completely stupid Idea. The speed is barely noticeable (they could've at least doubled movement speed), the melee is useless when you compare the damage at close range to shotguns, and all the perks are pretty crap when, if you go with cloak, within your first 2 points every head shot recharges your shield, and if you go with overcharge, one perk lets you take half damage after your shield breaks!

I played Rift (also by Trion) during launch and was expecting the same level of polish from Defiance. Boy, was I wrong. I love the general idea of a TPS MMO, like how they went Borderlands on the weapons and it sure is purdy. But it just isn't finished yet. Player interaction is limited to the point of non-existence and there is no crafting or trading system in place.

While these are quite basic things to have in a MMO, usually I'd expect them to be launched after release. However, there are these five DLC's they have planned. That's got me worried. I think it's rather ambitious to look that far ahead of what you have now when the basics are still unfinished.

And then there is the matter of the players. Or the lack of them. Steam purchases are lagging behind and even this subreddit is awful quiet, even compared to that of -say- The Secret World before launch. And that one didn't fare too well.

TL;DR: It's a game I'd love to love, but it feels like it is unfinished and not gaining enough traction.

I wondered if we could be expecting anything like this in the near future to compliment the experience of DEFIANCE.

EGO TRACKER: This would be a helpful app for setting up specific strategies and builds revolving around the variety of play styles that each perk can either boost or slow down. 

THIS COULD ALSO COMBINE WITH&gt;&gt;&gt;

Defiance Hall of Ark Hunting: Having clan/group; discussion, raid planning, group contract completion, and pursuit hunting at the tip of your fingers. On your way home, bored at work, or barely awake in class, you could quickly plan out and schedule entire nights of conquest with your clan mates or online buddies (i already know that someone is going to say ""We have reddit for that, we don't need this"". Truth being not everyone in our clan, and especially the game is a redditor, respectively speaking we are an elite *cough* group of people.) The app will also include up to date information on: New Contracts, Arkfall Locations, Defiance patches, and news updates. We could actually be more methodical in our exploration of the game world. 

This is as i stated above nothing more than a thought that i had earlier today that i believe could be very helpful to all of us Ark Hunters.

First I was stuck at the ""select load out"" screen for the entire match, which thankfully was only 5 minutes or so. Afterwards I was sent back into the defiance world ready to kick ass. This is when I noticed I could not switch my weapons. I bring up the character menu and I can not access anything on the first tab, my primary gun slot is empty, I can not switch load outs, and my secondary weapon is a shotgun that does not show up on my character (and I can't even use it outside of the menu). I can only equip one weapon at a time, and this can only be done from the inventory section. I can not change the early mentioned shotgun only a non existent gun in the primary slot. I also can not play any PVP because the selection screen locks up.  All of the game mechanics still work, i.e. running, nades, zoom, shooting, etc. but I can only use what perks I had set up at the time and one weapon.

I think this bug occurred because I was attaching mods to that damn shotgun before I entered the Match making level.

To purchase the boxes with resources, you need the following resources:

|Box Tier|Price (keycode)|Price (Scrip)|Reward|
|:-:|:-:|:--------------:|:-------------------------------|
2|8|1000|2 random items of at least uncommon rarity|
3|24|2000|3 random items of at least uncommon rarity|
4|64|3000|4 random items of at least uncommon rarity|

If the items are the same, you can get 3 different Tier 2 boxes for basically the price of one Tier 3 - the scrip is negligible because it's easy to obtain.  For the price of Tier 4 (64 keycodes) you can get 8 Tier 2 boxes. 

I've only bought two tier 2 boxes, so I don't know if the item quality are better in tier 3 and 4 - I would assume they are just because of how lopsided the cost is between the tiers, but the description doesn't give any clues.

I picked up Defiance last night, hoping that it would be a lot like Tabula Rasa. I have to say that thus far I'm having fun with it, but was really on the fence about whether I should buy it in the first place.

While I'm sure that it's not completely representative of the complete package, I hope it at least helps someone decide whether or not the basic mechanics look like fun.

What's in the feed is very fluffy, not much in the way of serious information. There are a couple of direct tweets regarding the game, specifically talking about the Defiance universe continuing in the game regardless of the show airing (which we already knew), and that more elements of the game will cross over into the TV show during Season 2.

There's going to be a Twitch.tv stream at 2pm Pacific today, and the Defiance FB feed says it's going to reveal more details about the Castithan Charge Pack DLC.

EDIT: The Twitch.tv stream will be at [http://www.twitch.tv/twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/twitch). It should be starting any time now.

Now obviously graphics aren't everything but with a game (I'm sorry but it's true) as average as this I want as many aspects as I can being as good as they can. Also the frame rate on my older model 360 tends to dip quite a bit and I have a pretty ok PC that should run it well.

1373489116.0	1i176a	I don't understand what LMGs were supposed to be for in the first place?	InfamousBrad	8	4	13	"Please be patient, I only started playing the game about a month ago, and I still don't fully understand all of the weapons. But one in particular baffles me, and with all the controversy over on the official forums about the [incoming Squad Assault Weapon nerf](http://forums.defiance.com/showthread.php?105051-Upcoming-Balance-Changes), I thought I'd ask this question that's been bothering me, off and on, all month: what was supposed to be the whole point of the Light Machine Guns?

What were they supposed to be used for? The only in-game clue is the combat pursuit [Stout Tactics III](http://www.defiancedata.com/pursuits.php?category=Combat) (and its predecessors). It gives the title ""Tank,"" and to get it, you specialize in LMGs and Decoy; in addition, you need level 10 in Bio Magnetic Guns and level 5 in Detonators. So I assume that the LMG is supposed to be the tanker/healer primary weapon?

That would explain why it's such a high recoil gun, if it's supposed to be used at near point blank range into the back of something that's attacking your decoy, I guess. And if you're supposed to use a BMG once the LMG's magazine empties, I guess that's why it's okay that they take so long to reload? But, assuming they go through with their plan to normalize BMG damage, is there any reason why a tanker would prefer a Light Machine Gun to an Assault Rifle? Does the LMG cause knockback or make enemies flinch more often? Does it draw more aggro? Does it more reliably trigger secondary effects?

(**Please note:** The point of this thread is not to argue about how people use SAWs now and how awful it is that they're being nerfed. The question is a more theoretical one; how do you think Trion means the weapon to be used?)"	t5_2siko	True

1370844884.0	1g140o	Expanding The Grid: A Tentative Suggestion List to Perks	Beastmister	5	0	12	"Rawr Ark Hunters!

For a while I've been pondering about, when the game gets more content and a bigger overall playing ground, what's going to happen to the grid?  That kind of modest EGO grid with all the fancy perks that improve our character, it's got to change at some time right?  Maybe they'll just expand it, or maybe they'll rework the entire grid altogether, but either way I think it'd be staple to see some changes to put the niche in character development many of us are looking for.  I mean, of course, by implementing things more diverse than four powers and an array of perks.  Here's the idea:

**When the EGO Grid changes, which eventually it will, perks should be arranged with new additives to either a specific perk or a power in use.  What I've taken to calling Attributes, Exclusives, and Ark Brains could be these new additives, each with their own unique niche role.  Fear my paint skills.**

* **Perks** as it stands now are what I call **Defiance Teal**.  This teal represents the basic passive ability that one would equip on their loadout screen.
* **Additives**, which may be coded in **green**, would not be equipped in the loadout screen.  Rather, they would only be unlocked when a specific adjacent perk is unlocked that relates to the additive.  Then, up to three EGO Units (level up points) may be spent on the additive to further improve a specific factor of that perk.  [Here's a Picture example for an attribute to Assassin's Cache.](http://imgur.com/cgGyXgj)  Makes sense, right?
* **Exclusives**, which may be coded in **red**, are not individual perks, but groupings of them.  If one exclusive adjacent to another is invested in by the player, then the adjacent exclusives become locked.  This could work to pair certain opposing perks together, in the means to allow a player to only choose one of them.  And to make things more complicated, yes, attributes should also be allowed to be exclusives.  [In this example, you see a pair of exclusives.  One is locked because the other is invested in.  The attribute related to the locked exclusive is, as expected, also locked.](http://imgur.com/3NdIPiH)
* **Ark Brains** which may be coded in **purple**, would be perks or attributes that would *only function in an area of influence (Arkfall, siege, shadow war)*.  Before you go screaming omgimbalanced, chill, these are up-in-the-air theory bubbles, no popping.  Since Ark Brains aren't always active they may or may not be more powerful in relation to other perks.  Essentially though, they're for giving players an edge in the big open world brawls if they so choose to invest in it.  [This example shows an Ark Brain copy of Cellular Armor, called Infused Armor.  If the player so chose, they may equip both to have a 12% damage reduction bonus in areas of influence, and 6% outside areas of influence.](http://imgur.com/ApHXcSI)

That's essentially it, a very rough sketch of the ideas I've had about expanding the EGO grid.  What do you think?  Like it, hate it, what kind of ideas would you have for these new additives to the grid?

Personally I find semi-autos way too ammo greedy, so something like the additive's example would be spectacular.  That's all for now, cheers Ark Hunters!  :3"	t5_2siko	True
1370625860.0	1fvgm2	Low Render Distances for players/vehicles (Especially in Matchmaking)?	ChiefBigAssTree	7	2	3	"I've started playing multiplayer matchmaking recently and I've noticed there is a very low render distance for players and vehicles. In fact it is much shorter than the sniper rifle ranges, making them less effective.

In some cases I can even see a gun floating around and shooting, but cannot see the player. My reticule turns red and I do damage if I shoot, but I am unable to see the player's body. Is anyone else noticing this? I find this makes me have to get well into assault rifle range before I can effectively snipe, making it almost pointless to do so. Other times a vehicle will just appear out of thin air and run me over.



I understand low render distance help a lot for people with mid/low end computers, but could we have a slider for render distance for those of us with high-end rigs?

I want an option in the menu that completely customizes the hue of your shield, from zero degree black to maximum degree white!  Would other players be able to see the colour change?

Edit: Thanks for the feedback everyone! I do already use a Respark, but I'll take these notes into account and give it another go (or 20). Much appreciated!

Edit 2: Got silver after about 12 or so more tries today. I ended up really utilizing the cover, which is only the four little cement corners and a big rock (not sure what a couple people were saying about going around the building - the event ended if you went outside of this little circle). 

I tried keeping the trigger held down the whole time as suggested, but could only get bronze that way - the recoil was too crazy. The other element I utilized was popping in and out of aim mode to reset the aim assist while simultaneously bursting the trigger to keep bloom/recoil down. 

The last thing, and some people will probably think this is dumb, but towards the last few goes, instead of getting pissed every time I would fail, I tried to keep a good attitude about it. I got 22k right after that decision, then 26k on the next (compared with 15ish and lower before).
