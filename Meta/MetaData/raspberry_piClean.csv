As the energy output is in the form of xray and neutron radiation, even with a bit of shielding it can be dangerous. For the computer engineering portion of the project, I built a camera system for watching the window remotely.

This was the 'turn in' portion of my capstone project.

Camera using a freecycle'd Logitech Quickcam Chat, HDD is a cheap Toshiba 500G, a keyboard with built-in trackpad, the router a Linksys that works 100% with DD-WRT. 

RPi running the bastard child of LinuxFromScratch and Arch. Entire OS built from source; glibc, binutils, etc built to Arch specs for compatibility. Pacman/Yaourt installed for access to PKGBUILDs. Kernel running a modified 3.9, modifications from patches submitted to the linux-rpi-kernel mailing list. 

Once the base system was cross compiled under a patched GCC (for floating point), I setup arch's package handler for access to PKGBUILDs to easily add or remove additional packages. I built ffmpeg, xfce4, and a some other stuff out of the arch source, but the core was built by me.

*****

When plugged in, kernel is loaded off of the SD card, which then passes to the HDD, where root is kept. We really need to come up with a way to forgo the SD requirement, imho. 

The HDD will boot up to a prompt, with everything 'up'. 

You can either attach IO to the RPi, or you can SSH in from another computer. For my turn in, I did both. Once logged in, I setup a script entitled 'ff' which launched ffserver and ffmpeg, and streamed to cam.mjpeg at 320x240@20fps with pretty good quality considering. 

The router was easily setup as a Wireless Bridge, connecting it to the school's wireless system, providing my network internet capabilities. I'd done this at home as well to get package sources. By using DD-WRT, I was able to take a lot of strain off the RPi regarding networking.. I'd discovered that when using wpa_supplicant wireless, it actually used a bit more cpu when streaming, and I wasn't able to reliably stream 320x240. When I streamed and hit max cpu, I was crashing the camera kernel modules. 

So, to reliably stream 320x240, I had to be at command line, on ethernet, with minimal daemons running. If I dropped down to 160x120@10fps or 320x240@1fps, then I could run xfce, wireless, and so on. 

*****
I'll share configurations, scripts, and so on later today; as the overall project as-is can be used for more than just my use, and is easily duplicated using a stock Arch system.

1369241938.0	1eue4o	PSA: If your Pi has SSH exposed to the world, remember to secure it.	slashcom	193	33	64	"I'm new to the RPi community, but after observing this subreddit for a while, it's clear to me that a number of members are relatively new or unexperienced with Linux. Some of these members may not be aware of how dangerous it is exposing SSH to the internet, so I'm hoping to bring it to the attention these members.

If you expose SSH to the rest of the world, here are some tips on securing your RPi:
http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/Network/SecuringSSH

Echoing and tailoring them specifically to the Raspbian Image:

1) Use strong passwords and usernames. 

*If you use the default password, you need to change it immediately.* 

I'd actually recommend using a new user and disabling the default pi user.

If they haven't already, it won't be long until script kiddies start adding pi/raspberrypi to the default username/password list they try on every public facing SSH server.

2) Disable root login.

Unless you've enabled it, this is already done.

3) Disable protocol 1

SSH has two versions, and the newer one is marginally more secure than the old one. Very few people need the old version (and they usually know who they are), so it might as well be disabled.

4) Use a nonstandard port

This is the easiest one. There are literally millions of bots out there that spend quite a bit of bandwidth doing nothing but searching for SSH servers on port 22 and trying a very large number of username/password combos. Moving to a non-22 port significantly reduces the number of these attacks you'll undergo.

5) Use SSH keys for authentication

This actually allows you to disable password authentication entirely, and is significantly more secure than using a password.
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys has lots of information on the hows and whys.

Announcement at [http://raspberrypi.org/](http://raspberrypi.org/)

Price remains at $35 (Model B) and $25 (Model A) officially, but there are reports of small/large variations around the world further complicated by shipping costs etc.

The Model A can also be *pre-ordered* and now has the same RAM as the Model B: *256MB*.

Farnell/element 14 and RS Electronics will produce and sell the boards under license and accept pre-orders after the initial batch is sold-out. This is so production can scale immediately to much higher numbers.

1355859576.0	152e6b	An Allied Electronics Horror Story	drewofdoom	162	24	38	"Just thought I'd share an experience that my girlfriend and I recently went through in trying to get our Pi.

**TL;DR** Allied Electronics will take your money, give you no information on the status of your order and will not respond to your inquiries.

We ordered through Allied Electronics, as we live in the US.  It was backordered at the time.  OK, no problem.  We can wait.

Fast-forward 3 months.  My girlfriend notices a mysterious $55.00 charge on her card.  Looking into it, we realize that it's from Allied Electronics and has to be the Pi.  $55 seemed a little high, even with shipping.  She sent out an e-mail asking for an explanation of the situation.  No response.

A week later, the charge drops to $43.  That makes more sense with regards to shipping.  But we still haven't heard anything from Allied.  There's no shipping notification, no notice that they're back in stock, no response to our inquiry about the charge or the fact that they haven't contacted us, nothing.

It's been two weeks.  There's no Pi.  There's no shipping notification.  There's still no response from Allied.  At this point, she's going to back-charge Allied with the help of her bank.  We'll be looking into placing an order through Element14/Newark next week.

If there's one thing we've learned from this, it's that Allied Electronics is the absolute worst distributor we've ever worked with.  Looking around, you hear similar horror stories regarding them and the Pi all over the place.  What's worse is that these forums posts have a nasty habit of disappearing.  At this point, it's become obvious that they're being erased (read: censored) from the RPi forums.

If you want a Pi, don't buy from Allied Electronics.  I've read horror stories about RS as well, but can't comment on them from personal experience.

I mean, backorder is one thing.  Silently taking your money without shipping your purchased item is another thing entirely.

**EDIT**  Already getting downvoted.  Sorry for trying to warn other people who want to purchase a Pi, I guess...  If you really want to get the run-around from Allied, go ahead and order.  I'm not going to stop you.

**EDIT 2** Wow!  Thanks for all the responses, guys!  We'll be placing our order with Element14 or MCMElectronics early next week.  As for me getting downvoted by Reddit's automation... That usually only happens when there are a lot of votes in one direction, which is to discourage mob mentality.  Typically doesn't happen on brand new votes, driving the post down to zero.  I'm no karma whore, as you can tell from my 152 link karma (not that self-posts matter for that anways).  Just thought it strange that people would downvote a post to oblivion that's just trying to warn others of awful distributors.

Also, I wanted to mention that we didn't particularly care about the time we've spent on backorder.  We knew that would happen going in.  It's the complete lack of communication that has us furious."	t5_2syto	True

1361537328.0	190nw3	My Raspberry Pi Packet Sniffer	Xtrato	127	10	39	"I have setup a network sniffer that i can use to capture packets between two networking devices. I made a YouTube video in which i explain how it works and below you will find both the shell script and python script i used to setup the bridge and dump the packets respectively.

http://youtu.be/ZaHu0PratLU

The raspberry pi is placed in the middle and any data travelling between each device is captured by it. A second USB to Ethernet adapter is used to provide the second interface. The adapter i used is a USB to Fast Ethernet 10100 Mbps Network LAN Adapter Vista Linux 27723.

When the Raspberry pi starts it loads two scripts. The first is this shell script below:

    ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0
    ifconfig eth1 0.0.0.0
    brctl addbr bridge0
    brctl addif bridge0 eth0
    brctl addif bridge0 eth1
    ifconfig bridge0 up



This script removed the IP address from eth0 and eth1. It then creates a bridge called bridge0. Adds the interfaces to bridge0 and starts the bridge.

The second script that starts after the one above is this python script.

    import subprocess
    #from dbupload import upload_file #Used for Dropbox uploading
    from datetime import datetime # Used the genreate the filename
    count = 0 #Counts the number of files that have been dumped
    while True:
        count = count + 1
        fileName = str(datetime.now().day) + ""-"" + str(datetime.now().month) + ""-"" + str(datetime.now().year) + "" AT "" + str(datetime.now().hour) + ""-"" + str(datetime.now().minute)
        tcpDumpProcess = subprocess.Popen([""tcpdump"", ""-Z"", ""root"", ""-w"", fileName, ""-i"", ""bridge0"", ""-G"", ""60"", ""-W"", ""1""]) #Sets up the TCPDump command
        tcpDumpProcess.communicate() #Runs the TCPDump command
        print ""Currently dumping file number "" + str(count) + "".""
        #upload_file(fileName,""/"",fileName, ""YOUR_EMAIL"",""YOUR_PASSWORD"") #Uploads the dump file to dropbox
        #print ""File uploaded Successfully""

This can obviously be done without using python and running the TCPDump command from command line. My intention was to integrate Dropbox uploading to the process but failed due to the inability to gain an internet connection from the raspberry pi when configured with a software bridge.

With both these files saves onto the raspberry pi and executed from the rc.local file at startup it will allow the raspberry pi to automatically capture network traffic between two devices."	t5_2syto	True

1341046678.0	vu3os	RPi does 8000 interrupts/s due to inefficient USB code, slows it down by 20%	offbytwo	121	15	36	"Due to the driver supplied by the USB IP core provider, the Raspberry Pi has an overhead of 20% when USB is enabled.

This is caused by the 8000 interrupts per second which are supposed to handle the USB events and data.

This issue isn't just something which doesn't matter or which can just be ignored. It's a serious issue as this hinders the use of RPi for many high performance and latency sensitive projects. For example, it's nowhere near the arduino. You just can't write some code and expect it to have the same processing throughput and latency all the time due to this issue and others.

Simply suspending the USB yields a 20% performance increase.

Given the many problems many individuals have encountered with keys not being picked up and some folks reporting that they get better performance in Openelec with the network unplugged, this seems to be a very real bottleneck.

It might be fixed by writing a custom interrupt handler in ASM.

Holy f***.

I mean I previously steamed content through my PS3 with PS3MediaServer but this is helluva lot better.

* 1080p lagfree decoding? check
* Remote controlling with my PC, with my effin TV Remote Control or via iPhone? triple-check
* Copying content over from my PC to the external HDD attached to the pi via the windows explorer? check
* A shitload of really really useful addons (xStream, any online video library, system backup/restore, effin live subtitle search/download/load while I watch a movie, the list goes on and on)? CHECK
* Adjusting adio and/or subtitle delays with pressing two effin buttons? check.
* Nightly updates? check
* Adjusting stuff/browsing while watching the movie in the background? check
* Never used any non-windows or apple system before and still able to control it perfectly? check

Seriously, I did not see any negative aspect of this thing so far and you can believe me I pressed nearly every button in there already. Tested various movies, both LAN stream, local (USB HDD) and online streams.

I jsut wanted to tell you how much I love this thing. And no I am in no way affiliated with the company producing this hardware or software.
I will definitely donate to the developers of raspbmc (XBMC)."	t5_2syto	True

Arch has a steep learning curve however, so I see why this may put people off. So is there something else I'm missing? I've always assumed that seeing as Arch is so barebones that it could be moulded into pretty much whatever you wanted, whereas other distributions may be more tailored OOTB.

I thought i would share with you my latest project involving the raspberry pi. I decided to make a random number generator using the static from an untuned TV.

Basically i setup the raspberry pi with a webcam and pointed it as the static on the TV. I used a python script to take a picture every couple of seconds. It then converted the picture it took into a black/white image.

This image was iterated through and a very long binary digit was created by reading if the current pixel is a black or white pixel and appending a 1 or 0 to a variable.

This variable was this converted to a decimal number and output to a file as a random number.

I created a [YouTube video](http://youtu.be/qTuNwIO1lBM) of the process and explained it a bit clearer in there. I also blogged about the process [here](http://jamesdotcom.com/?p=417) if interested.

Below is the source code:

    import Image
    import subprocess
    devNull = open('/dev/null', 'w')#used to output the fswebcam stdout and stderr
    name = 0
    while True:
        name = name + 1
        randomBits = """"
        pixelRow = 0
        pixelColumn = 0
        captureImage = subprocess.Popen([""fswebcam"", ""-r"", ""356x292"", ""-d"", ""/dev/video0"", ""static.jpg"", ""--skip"", ""10""], stdout=devNull, stderr=devNull)
        captureImage.communicate()#executes the command detailed above with takes a picture using the webcam
        staticImage = Image.open(""static.jpg"")#Opens the image
        bW_Image = staticImage.convert('1')#Converts the image to a black or white image
        imageToProcess = bW_Image.load()#Saves the image to a variable that can be iterated through
        while pixelRow &lt; staticImage.size[0]:#Iterates through the image pixel by pixel
            while pixelColumn &lt; staticImage.size[1]:
                if imageToProcess[pixelRow, pixelColumn] == 0:
                    randomBits = randomBits + ""0""#Adds a 0 to the randomBits variable if the current pixel is white
                else:
                    randomBits = randomBits + ""1""#Adds a 1 to the randomBits variable if the current pixel is black
                pixelColumn = pixelColumn + 1
            pixelRow = pixelRow + 1
            pixelColumn = 0
        output = open('output.txt', 'w')
        output.write(str(int(randomBits, 2)))#Writes the randomBits Variable to the output file converted to a decimal number

* Front and rear wide-angle 1080p@30fps (H.264) cameras with loop recording, saved from being overwritten by accelerometer ""event"" and/or manual ""oh shit"" button (dashcam-like functionality).
* Design open source RPi carPC power supply that survives [load dumps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_dump), has battery watchdog (can't drain battery flat) and has direct sub-system power control (5v, 12v, etc).
* Finish writes and unmount video/sensor data filesystem X seconds after external power loss (and even all USB connections lost).
* 3 axis accelerometer: +-12g @ 13bit, up to 1600Hz update rate.
* 15 watts total power consumption recording 2 cameras to flash (no display or media hardware).


Many of you will quickly (and rightfully) bawk 'the RPi can't software-encode a single 1080p@30fps video stream in H.264 at real-time, let alone two at once'. Luckily for us, the fairly new [Logitech C920 webcam](http://www.oz9aec.net/index.php/gstreamer/473-using-the-logitech-c920-webcam-with-gstreamer) has an on-board H.264 encoder and video4linux supports dumping the 3.1MB/s H.264 encoded stream coming over USB to disk without any [transcoding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcoding) by the CPU. So rather than this being a computational horsepower issue, it's a bandwidth and context switching issue (reading from USB, writing to SD). The *great* news is the RPi's main bus (~60MB/s) seems to be able to handle this load with ease on paper ([see linked google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Aq-4kGISDbpvdDQ0WVRqVi03cWU2Um5CX1lhU1hreWc&amp;output=html)).


While spec'ing out this project, I searched for off-the-shelf hardware solutions to the many power supply problems one would come across in an RPi-based carPC project and found none. Faced with no easy way to meet my project goals, I started planning my own power supply (on a custom PCB) to meet RPi's needs in a carPC environment.


This project will be open source (likely GPL2) and **I welcome collaboration!**
[My project notes/spec spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Aq-4kGISDbpvdDQ0WVRqVi03cWU2Um5CX1lhU1hreWc&amp;output=html) gives the best overview of the project and power supply planning currently ongoing. I'm very confident I can get the custom hardware built quickly once a design is finalized (I have 8 years of mixed-signal EE experience from concept to completed&amp;populated custom PCBs). I'm also confident I can get the software/embedded firmware done, but it's is not my strongest area and will take me a long time to complete compared to a typical embedded software developer (few months vs maybe week or two). If anyone feels the opposite about embedded systems, speak up please. Once I spin the first version of the PSU board, I'll have a few extra boards I can populate with parts for serious developers at no cost.


Want to help but can't directly assist with lower-level development? Think about any features **you** would want in an RPi carPC power supply or RPi HD-video black-box. Need four analog lines for your car's &lt;whatever_widget&gt;? Now is the perfect time to consider all other options/features to suit the community at large.


Edit: I've just found a [rather disturbing thread](http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=28&amp;t=12097) about the USB controller and driver over at the main RPi forum. After reading the first few pages, this may be a difficult workload for the rickety USB system. More research is required..."	t5_2syto	True

http://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/rfo7q/raspberry_pi_alternatives/c45rnm2



I need a linux device capable of running a webserver for php/mysql and do some testing with node.js/mongoDB.
I want to keep it running 24/7 so low power consumption is a must and that's why I'm not just using an old PC/laptop.

I really wanted to buy a Raspberry Pi but I set myself a deadline (End of March 2012) and now I'm looking for alternatives:

Alix Board (http://www.pcengines.ch)

Beagleboard (http://http://beagleboard.org/)

Netbook (or PC) with Intel Atom?! (I don't know about power consumption on those)

(The Sheevaplug seems to have stability/heat issues, so I don't plan on buying one)

Any other recommendations or advice?

They're pretty damn awesome and easy to use. I was using python (the python package RPi.GPIO even comes preinstalled in Raspbain). As the guide said, the pins are unprotected, so you can easily damage the board if you short the wrong pins. I thought I was being careful, but I guess I wasn't. When the short happened, the monitor went dead, and the RPi was forever dead.

On http://elinux.org/RaspberryPiPerformance we have some published benchmark numbers for common microbenchmarks. I underclocked an Atom N270 to about 630 MHz and did the very same benchmarks. I did not run the dhrystone/whetstone tests because I don't have the sources of the benchmarks used. [Here are the results.](http://pastebin.com/yJj8WX3M) Please compare yourself.

So there you have it: **the Raspberry Pi's CPU provides about one third of the integer and floating point throughput of a similarly clocked Intel Atom**. That's seven to eight times slower than a typical Intel Atom running at 1.6 GHz.

StevenHickson	69	15	31	"A couple of days ago I posted a hack which allowed people to stream youtube videos in the browser. Unfortunately, this same method didn't work out of the box for some other video sites. They would stream a couple seconds then just end.  
I now have a fix for that and have a script called youtube-safe, which can stream (high-quality with no lag on a decent internet connection) any video site that works with youtube-dl.  
  
To use it, you need to get youtube-dl and update it with the command:  
sudo apt-get install youtube-dl &amp;&amp; sudo youtube-dl -U  
Then you need to get my script like so:  
sudo wget -N -P /usr/bin/ https://raw.github.com/StevenHickson/PiAUISuite/master/Youtube/youtube-safe  
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/youtube-safe  
  
Alternatively you can install it automatically as part of my AUISuite which can be found here:  
https://github.com/StevenHickson/PiAUISuite  
  
Once that is done, you can watch the daily show in 1080p like so:

The service [www.duckdns.org](https://www.duckdns.org) is run on Amazon EC2, it is a cluster of instances with load balancing, elastic cache and runs on a DynamoDB.

You can login with a google Open ID (V2) and can claim (4 at the moment) free subdomains of duckdns.org.

We have services over HTTP or HTTPS (certificates work on most Web browsers, but not some tablets and phones - yet)

We have specific instructions for the standard Pi build https://www.duckdns.org/install.jsp#pi and also for the Raspbmc https://www.duckdns.org/install.jsp#raspbmc

The only bit we don't tell you how to do is to tell your router to send port 22 to your pi, there are too many routers out there to make comprehensive instructions.

If you are new to DDNS, what is means is that you can claim a subdomain (testng.duckdns.org), and once setup you can access your pi from anywhere on the internet using that domain  - ssh pi@testng.duckdns.org

We hope you enjoy the service - we have a new and empty Google+ Community page at https://plus.google.com/communities/111042707043677579973"	t5_2syto	True

Before I resort to solution based upon the use of a lump hammer, can some kind soul please recommend a reliable, good value 8gb SD card that works well for them.

1350583832.0	11p8xj	Configure your PI to auto-email its IP address on boot	bilateralconfusion	70	17	42	"Every time my network would fail or  my PI would reboot its IP address would change. My PI is headless and it is a real pain to hunt down a monitor and keyboard just to retrieve the IP. I don't want to configure it with a static IP as I connect it to several different networks.

So this morning I wrote a simple python script that automagically emails me the IP address of the device. I then configured the OS to execute this script after.

It's very easy to use and will prove to be a real life saver.

Heres a [link to the script](https://gist.github.com/3913056)
 
 * Download the script
 * Edit the script to use a valid email account lines( 14-17 &amp; 20)
 * Execute a test run to verify that everything is working
 * If the test passes, copy the script to your pi and save at */etc/init.d/email-ip*
 * Set permissions on the file: *chmod 711 /etc/init.d/email-ip*
 * Configure the script to execute on boot: *update-rc.d /etc/init.d/email-ip start 99 2 .*


*Notes*: This script will contain the login credentials for an email account. Anyone with root access to your machine will be able to retrieve these credentials. So I highly suggest you create a dummy account that is **only** used for sending these emails, and use a password that is UNIQUE to this account.

Finally, I have plans to modify the script to send emails whenever the IP address changes.  I'll post back when i've made those changes.

My job uses high level languages only, and I have been exposed to a few high level languages over the years. However, I feel like I am missing some of the perspective and skills one gains when they program closer to the hardware level. I was never required nor encouraged to learn this, so the RPi seems like a perfect platform to learn this on and remedy that.

In case anyone is interested in doing the same I thought I'd share some research. Likely the first link is widely known but I did a search of this subreddit and didn't find any reference to the second one.

Today I received a pair of new SD cards, and a new USB 3.0 SD card reader.

Both as an exercise in writing a semi-scientific report, and just being curious to what the difference is between my USB 3.0 and USB 2 card readers, I decided to do a little benchmarking. While I was at it, I decided to also compare a number of different SD cards I had lying around.

Since I wasn't able to find any recent benchmarks on the SD cards online, I figured you might like the outcome of my little study.
Excuse the extensive wall of text. I wanted to keep it short and simple, but as I was typing, I kept including more and more, turning it more into a semi-scientific review.

###Materials used:

##SD HC cards
* Sandisk 8GB Extreme 30MB/s
* Sandisk 16GB Ultra 30MB/s
* Samsung 16 GB 40MB/s W - 80 MB/s R
* Samsung 32 GB 40MB/s W - 80 MB/s R

##PC:
* P8Z77-M PRO (USB 3.0 port used was one on the front)
* i5 3570K

##USB 3.0 reader: 
* Transcend TS-RDF8K (with latest TS21 firmware, who knew that you could actually update a card readers' firmware?!)

##USB 2 reader: 
* Sitecom MD-018 V1 001

##Software used: 
* H2testw v1.4 (1000 MByte)
This software writes a 1GB piece of information in a single file to the drive, and measures the time it  takes to write, and to read. So basically a sequential test.


###Results:

Card|USB 3.0 Write speed [MB/s]|USB 3.0 Read speed [MB/s]|USB 2 Write speed [MB/s]|USB 2 Read speed [MB/s]
:--|--:|--:|--:|--:
Sandisk 8GB|26.4|41.1|17.3|20.4
Sandisk 16GB|32.5|41.1|17.8|20.4
Samsung 16GB|29.5|70.4|16.4|20.4
Samsung 32GB|28.6|70.3|16.3|20.4|


Even though both the sandisk cards are promoted with 30MB/s speeds (read or write not specified), which I had assumed to be optimistic, they surprised me by actually reading faster than this. of course, any card will preform best in a sequential test.

The samsung cards didn't do that good in this regard. Both writing and reading speeds were lower than specified. 
Interesting to note though is that the 16 and 32 GB cards preform almost identically. My experience with Solid State Drives in PCs is that how bigger the drive gets, the faster it will be. Apparently, this doesn't apply to SD cards.

The USB 3.0 speeds are a lot higher than the USB 2 speeds. Because of the little variation between the measured speeds here, I think it is safe to assume that the USB 2 interface is the bottleneck.
Curious to see is that the samsung cards are a bit slower than the sandisk cards, in USB 2 write speeds. Since the cards should be able to handle higher speeds, I am unsure about what causes this difference (probably something to do with the internal controller in the SD card).

###Discussion:
As far as accuracy goes of these measurements, please take em with a grain of salt.
I've tried another type of software as well, CrystalDiskMark 3.0.2. This is a more extensive test, but I chose not to use this software, because a single test takes much longer.
The results for the 8GB sandisk in H2testw were W 26MB/s, R 41MB/s, while CDM gave W 36MB/s, R 44MB/s.
meaning quite a large difference exists between different methods of measuring speed. You should only compare cards that were measured in the same way.

##Did my USB 2 reader reach it's speed limit?

yes

##Did the USB 3.0 controller reach it's maximum speed?

Of this I cannot be entirely sure.
When I compare the CrystalDiskMark (another piece of measuring software) scores for sequential reading and writing, that I've found for my samsung 32GB card, to the ones found online, using the same Transcend controller, but a faster SD card (http://www.legitreviews.com/article/2152/2/), I see that the values are higher for that card.
This could indicate that the card is faster, or that something else is hampering my speeds.
Since the card tested in the other review is faster than mine, I think we may assume that the transcend card reader is not bottoming out.

##Was my USB 2 reader as fast as it could be?
Since I kept including more and more in this ""short"" benchmark, I decided i might as well see what speeds I could get when I would stick my USB 3 reader in a native USB 2 port. the result surprised me a bit, since I got 32MB/s R, and 22 MB/s W speeds for my 32 GB card, compared to 20 MB/s R and 16 MB/s W on the other reader.

So no. It's actually a bit slow for a usb 2 reader.


###Conclusion:
Write speeds are about the same. The difference lies in the read speeds. For taking photographs, these do not matter. However, If you want to transfer the humongous amount of photos that fit on a 32 GB card onto your PC, the almost double read speeds of the samsung cards might be just what you need.

And it's definately worth it to upgrade to a USB 3.0 reader, in case you don't own one already.

And don't buy a sitecom USB 2 reader, they're slow.

Hope you all find some use in my little benchmark ;)"	t5_2syto	True

1364579305.0	1b957q	Found an unpowered USB Bluetooth mini-dongle that works great with the Pi for $1 on eBay	TrevorBradley	67	17	22	"I've been hunting for a Raspbery Pi bluetooth dongle to go with my Pi for a headless carputer project (bluetooth joystick input, mp3 and text-to-speech output to audio via line-in on my car stereo).  I also wanted WiFi so that I could download new audio and podcasts while parked in my garage.

The Wifi dongle was [relatively easy to find](http://www.ncix.com/products/?sku=74475), but the Bluetooth dongle was a bit more elusive.  The [RPi Verified Peripherals Page](http://elinux.org/RPi_VerifiedPeripherals#Working_Bluetooth_adapters) talked about a ""Cambridge Silicon Radio, Ltd Bluetooth Dongle (HCI mode) - (USB ID 0a12:0001)"", but there don't appear to be any links as to where I could get one.

I decided to take a shot on eBay, and ordered a couple of $1 bluetooth dongles.  One of them was a [""mushroom capped""](http://www.flickr.com/photos/gregrob/7606926434/) dongle that I've seen displayed in a few images talking about bluetooth compatibility, but I wasn't sure.  But I figured $1, what the heck.  I also got another square shaped $1 adapter.

The square one arrived and didn't work, but the mushroom connector works perfectly without extra power and identified as a 0a12:0001.  I've paired it with a WiiMote for testng and it works perfectly throughout my entire house, with no extra power.

I purchased this: [Mini USB 2.0 Bluetooth Dongle Adapter For PC laptop](http://www.ebay.ca/itm/200489258983?ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1497.l2649), but since the seller has made it unavailable to ship to Canada!  Still, I'd suspect most of the mushroom capped USB dongles might be worth the $1 if you were looking for one.

At the moment it's not too bad, but if the worst comes to the worst, maybe one day we could be in a similar position to china. And I deeply believe in an open, free and private internet. My ISP currently blocks several torrent websites, and sure there are mirrors, but I don't like this direction one bit.

There are various addons, free VPNs or even services like tor that either encrypt or anonyamise your data. The thing is not everyone has the knowledge or motivation to set these up, and doing so requires adding software to the computer, so does not work for mobile devices.

My idea is for  a custom raspberry pi image that could be be booted without a screen. The service can be configured over a simple web interface but could work out the box. The raspberry pi would have a USB ethernet adapter (or wifi adapter acting as a host) and would act like a straight through internet connection. However it would use HTTPS wherever possible, encrypt IM, facebook and any other internet chat if its possible, and has the option to use a VPN or tor. 

The idea is someone with no electronics or software knowledge can plug this in before their router and have every device in their house as secure as possible, or as secure as they wan't it to be.

I have limited networking knowledge, and a small amount of experience in C++ and python, and debian. I am an electronics engineer with a fair bit of experience in 3d modelling, so designing a custom usb ethernet adapter and a gpio status light board and a case isn't a problem. But I would need help with the software if this project is to take off.

----------
1. Configure the RaspberryPI board and install a linux OS.
2. Install XBMC (*maybe with spotify itergration*) on your raspberryPI board. 
3. Download and configure the Official XBMC Android remote app. 
4. Combine all the hardware and create or buy a case for it, when thats done hide it behind your TV.
5. Use the USB input of the TV for powering the RaspberryPI.
6. Your RaspberryTV is now ready for use customize it and have fun!


##The idea(when [RASPBMC](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/604) is released)

Figured I'd share it, since it takes like an hour to compile it on the Pi.

In case you don't know why one needs Quake 3 specifically for Raspbian, the Raspbian distro has hardfloat support, speeding up the system nicely.

The downside is the package support, every program needs to be compiled specifically for Raspbian.

Performance is a bit better than on default Debian, but it throws about a million errors when you start the game. Worked fine on my Pi, though.

Works like all the other pre-compiled Quake 3's, copy .pak files to base and start the game."	t5_2syto	True

Some of you may know me as the PiLFS guy, but I also wrote a book that I hope might pique your interest.
It's called [Raspberry Pi for Secret Agents](http://www.packtpub.com/raspberry-pi-for-secret-agents/book) and went on sale today in print and various eBook formats.
I wanted to write the book I wish I had when I first began exploring the world of computers.
It's all about having fun on the command line, setting up microphones and webcams for pranks or projects and learning a bit about Linux and networking along the way. Whether you're a complete newbie or seasoned hacker I think there's something cool in there for everyone.

Some of my favorite topics:

* Setting up video streams with MJPG-streamer
* Setting up Motion detection and alarms
* Scheduling audio/video recordings
* Mapping out your network with Nmap
* Pushing unexpected images into browser windows with Ettercap
* Tracking the Pi on Google Earth via GPS
* Sending periodic tweets from the Pi with GPS coordinates
* Creating an encrypted vault with cryptsetup
* Creating command shortcuts with aliases
* Keeping your recordings running safely with tmux
* Creating point-to-point wired and ad hoc Wi-Fi networks

Hope you guys like it!
Any reviews or feedback would be greatly appreciated.

I wanted to power the rPi directly from the hub but the voltage would ripple from 5.0v to 4.1v causing instability. I hooked an oscilloscope up to the test points and observed the tell-tale ripple of a [half-wave](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electronic/rectifiers.html) rectifier. I opened up the hub power supply and my suspicion was confirmed. Luckily the pcb had spots available for a full wave rectifier. I moved one wire, removed the diode and soldered in four more diodes.

There's a custom built atmega168 dev board connected to it via usb. I'm using the atmega to read an analog sensor using it's ADC (which the raspi does not have as far as I know). 

I take a sample every 5 seconds and store it in a Mysql db on the raspberry. I use a php script in order to query said db and generate a JS array used by charts.js to graph the data.

Mysql seemed a bit overkill but it works quite well, better/faster than expected. It's easy enough to average samples in order to display longer/shorter periods of time. 

libusb is required in order for the raspberry to be able to communicate with the atmega168  


Anyway, here's the result : http://i.imgur.com/nyscw6H.png

Edit : another graph with a different resolution (several hours) : http://i.imgur.com/2qqREZn.png (you can see that the raspi was off between 23h and 8h30 or so, there are no datapoints during that time but charts.js tries to extrapolate which is disturbing... i'm working on that). You can clearly see that when I started the A/C and that I made it cooler 15 minutes before going to bed. (woops looks like my loops used to create missing values as undef is off by one as there's no 8h45 on the graph)

I've seen various different ways of doing this with the Pi, was just wondering if anybody has any experience doing this themselves and is able to give any advice.

My ideal scenario is that I can take my Pi (model B) over to a friend's house along with only its power adapter, an HDMI cable and 2 wireless Xbox 360 controllers (as well as the USB wireless receiver). Hook up the Pi to their TV and boom, straight into a menu listing all my ROMs. No keyboard/mouse needed, everything controlled with the controllers. I'm all about no fuss.

Xbox 360 controllers aren't a must but obviously if they can be supported, that'd be awesome, since I own 4 of them already. Double awesome if there's any possibly for 4 simultaneous controllers.

Don't necessarily need support for every retro system under the sun - SNES/NES are the big ones, anything else is a bonus.

I know that popular x86-based emulators like snes9x have been rewritten for ARM, but there's a lot of mixed reports as to their quality/performance. There's also things like RetroArch and Osmose, but again I'm at a loss for which is the best option.

As for the frontend, I currently have a media server at home with XBMC providing the frontend for my ROM collection (using the Rom Collection Browser plugin). This is great, but it's overkill for the Pi. I've heard good things about RetroPie, but is that my only realistic option?

Honestly I'd love to dedicate a bunch of time to trying to work this all out for myself and learning as I go, but sadly I don't have a lot of spare time for tinkering. So, anybody got any tips? It'd be awesome to be able to take my Pi over to a friend's house and have instant Bomberman/NBA Jam going down."	t5_2syto	True

I was interested in this device way back before it first came out but really didn't know what I would do with it besides tinker, as I can accomplish the same feats better and easier on a multiple of devices I already own.

However I realized something very specific I would like to do with it earlier this week and remembered that a store just two blocks from me sells them ready and waiting. 

**What I've Learned**

Don't be in a hurry. Setting up the Raspberry Pi takes time. I had links and resources ready before I bought it, yet still wasn't aware of just how much compiling time is needed for some programs. 

Use scripts to automate install and compile. I have found these two to be the most useful after writing the [Raspbian “wheezy”](http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads) image to a SD card

[RetroPie-Setup](https://github.com/petrockblog/RetroPie-Setup)

[Pre-compiled XBMC for Raspbian](http://www.memetic.org/pre-compiled-xbmc-for-raspbian/)

Always back up your image! On PC, win32diskimager, is something that makes writing compiled images easy, but should be used for also reading them back in to an image! Expanding the full SD card space takes time, compiling Mame takes for ever, even with scripts to set it up for you.

Don't over clock until you have a stable set up! I made the mistake of over clocking right away and I ended up having to start over twice. Hours of compiling, wasted. Get Raspian Desktop loaded and all the assets updated first, then back up that image. 

sudo raspi-config

Split your memory 256/256, update the config option, desktop to boot (at first)

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get upgrade -y

sudo apt-get install -y git dialog


These take a long time and are a per-requisite for installing Emulation station. Get this stable then back up your image. 

OpenELEC XBMC works really well but (as far as I can tell) won't let you compile as much on top of it as Raspbian. XBMC on Raspbian does feel slower but a good overclock helps tremendously. The over clock settings I have used also allow Genesis emulation to run full speed and the Desktop to operate smoother, especially in the online browser.

arm_freq=1050

core_freq=500

sdram_freq=450

over_voltage=6

over_voltage_sdram=0

disable_overscan=1


XBMC has an option for sound over either HDMI or Analog, make sure you have it set to what option your using and add the line hdmi_drive=2 in your config.txt if you don't get sound over HDMI (reading the SD card in a PC is the best way to edit it, as it denies access with in the Raspian Desktop)



**What I still need to do!**

Emulation Station comes with, AdvanceMAME v1.2. which is based off of an old MAME 0.106.  I dislike all the different ROM sets needed for different versions of MAME and I still have to find a set that will work with this version.

Setup my Controller properly in Emulation Station and create key binds for common functions so I won't need to have a keyboard set up. This would not only include exiting the emulation running and returning to the menu but also save states, loads and Filter option. 

Change the Default stating emulator when Emulation Station starts up. Also change the back ground pictures!

As I have Raspbian Desktop, XBMC and Emulation Station installed I don't want any one of those to take over priority boot. I'd like a simple start up menu to choose which I boot into and not have to log in at the command line with User: PI and password:Raspberry (Default for every one)   

Alternatively I may want to give Emulation Station priority boot but when I exit, I would like to have a menu option to choose either XBMC or Raspbian Desktop. I'd rather avoid exiting to the Command line as I want to only navigate with a controller.

Find a way to have the Screen in Emulation Station fit better.  The Genesis doesn't use the full screen from top to bottom and it's offset more towards the top. I don't want it stretched but a full 4:3. Also the Game Gear is rendered really Small. 

Eventually get a hardware button to boot up the system and also be able to send a command that will properly power down the Raspberry Pi.

It'd be really nice to get rid of the Arduino, but the whole unprotected GPIO pins worries me.  My system controls:

* 3 120V heating elements by way of 3-22V SSRs
* 1 120V pump by way of a 3-22V SSR
* 1-3 Temperature Sensors (digital)
* 6 Electric Ball Valves (12 V) by way of a 5V relay board
* Possibly a display [like this (don't own it yet)](https://www.adafruit.com/products/931)

The relay board is what worries me the most, since I know the RasPi is unprotected against 5V... so how do I properly protect it (and why isn't this built in by default?).  Would using something [like this work?](http://adafruit.com/products/395)  Is that enough to protect the board?  Is there anything else to worry about?

I got the idea to use a monitor as a large photo frame and thought the Raspberry Pi would be perfect to run it.  The monitor has a built in 4 port usb hub.  The hub wasn't capable of providing proper power to the Pi, so I used one of [these cables](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047AALW6/ref=oh_details_o03_s01_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) to provide enough juice.  The integrated hub allows for automatic boot when you turn on the monitor by the power button I relocated to behind the frame.

I took the monitor apart and found the perfect place for the pi to live.  I used a dremel to cut out some access ports for the power, sound, ethernet, and sd card.  I was able to run most of the cables inside the plastic enclosure, and only had to cut a few smaller holes to allow everything to plug in.

To stop the pi from shorting out against the metal frame, I used a chinese knockoff version of a iphone 5 otterbox type case from Five and below, and dremeled off the sides to provide access to the ports.  The SD card and the power cable both fit through what would be the dock connector.  

I have a edimax wireless usb dongle on one of the pi's onboard usb ports, and the other onboard goes to the monitor's usb hub.  The speakers I used were also usb powered, so I only have one usb port available for use when needed.  Loading more pictures is simple.  I wrote a small script that will detect a usb flash drive when plugged in, find any photos on it, resize them to match the monitor's default resolution, and copies them to the slideshow directory. (the resizing cuts down on load times and saves space on the SD card)  Then, when the resizing is done for all the pictures, I get an email telling me it is done so I can take the usb drive out.

The pi runs raspbmc, and the photo slideshow comes from just the screensaver.  I did it this way so the frame could double as an internet radio while it showed my photos.  I also enjoy being able to airplay video from my phone to my photo frame.

It is currently still on the monitor stand, but I will be able to use a standard VESA mount to mount it to the wall later.

Overall it was a very fun project that took me about a week to finish.  I like the size compared to any of the digital picture frames you can get at the store."	t5_2syto	True

While I offloaded most of its duties onto an old laptop till the replacement mobo comes in. I needed something that would never get restarted for the website (simple static) and mumble server. I saw the Pi sitting there and thought, hey, lets give that a try. Im running the latest raspbian and its right in the repository (sudo apt-get install mumble-server) so setup couldn't be any easier. 

So while the Pi obviously cant run my tekkit server, it can easily run my website for me and my friends, and our mumble server. It regularly has 4-8  people on it, and nobody has even noticed a difference. I think ill probably just leave it over there. Its also running about 8 channels as its used for more than just minecraft chatting. All of my friends use it for VOIP in any game they play.

I think this is an excellent use for the Pi. I know a lot of people that host mumble servers for their friends but don't like doing so on their desktops due to the occasional restarts or what have you. Plus the Pi uses so little power. I don't know how many people it can hold before the quality suffers but Ive had 12 people on simultaneously all chatting away without any issue whatsoever with no overclock. This is hooked up and X running. I imagine if you don't have LXDE running it can handle more too. "	t5_2syto	True

I'm interested in using my pi with an external hard drive as a backup server. I backup my data daily, and need this server up as much as possible (as I likely won't know when I might need to restore from backup).

Ideally, I'd like this be totally wireless and self-contained so that I can just stick it all in an enclosure and store it offsite (at a friend's house). Wifi isn't a problem, but I'd prefer not to require a power outlet either. 

So really it comes down to this:

1. Is there an ""off the shelf"" solution that provides long-term battery power for a pi?
2. If not, what exactly do I need to be conscientious of (voltage, amps, watts, etc) when designing a solution myself?
3. What's the most reliable measure of a battery's ""capacity"" in this context?
4. What am I missing that I also need to consider?

Again, the goal is for this to be with ""no strings attached"" (literally). I don't mind having to switch out the battery occasionally, but I'd like to do this as infrequently as possible. Size is also not a major constraint. Thanks!"	t5_2syto	True

1367963702.0	1dw1y0	Automatic Reverse SSH with your Raspberry PI	AcksYouaSyn	44	8	8	"Things you need:    
A Raspberry PI    
A server running SSH somewhere visibile from the internet at large.    

Assuming raspbian wheezy:

sudo apt-get install daemontools csh    
sudo mkdir -p /etc/service/reversessh    
edit reversessh/run to be:

    #!/bin/bash
    exec setuidgid pi ssh -CNqg -R 2222:localhost:22 youruser@yourserver.org

Where that last bit is your publicly visible ssh server. 

You **need** to set up public key authentication on your ssh server and add your private key to your pi for this to work.

Next, edit /etc/rc.local to include the line

csh -cf '/usr/bin/svscanboot &amp;'

Now you can either reboot your pi, or just run svscanboot right now to get the tunnel running. svscan runs the tunnel at boot, and will restart it if it drops.

From your main PC you'd like to connect to the pi from run this:

ssh pi@yourserver.org -p 2222

You should now either automatically log (private key) in or get a password prompt from your pi.

Why is this useful? If you set your headless pi to connect to any available wifi network, you can just plug it in and not worry about what IP address it obtains because it'll always connect to your remote server.

1332790395.0	remqj	All this has happened before, and all this will happen again - Some perspective on preorder delays	candre23	49	13	36	"The [Pandora](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora_%28console%29#History) wasn't the first device to be designed and sold by enthusiasts with no money, but it's probably one of the best examples of just how bad that sort of situation can go.  

When the guys who dreamed up an open-source handheld console with decent specs first tried to get it made, the Chinese firm they paid to design it ran off with their money.  They kept going though, taking more input from the community and finding an engineer they could trust to get the board engineered.  After the design was finalized, preorders were announced.  The initial preorders were taken many months after they were initially scheduled, then had to be refunded a few weeks later due to Paypal being dicks.  The do-over preorders had to be sent by bank transfer, which is quite expensive in the US ($20-30 fee).  Those that paid in were told it would be a ""few months"" before the units were produced.

That was in 2008, and there are still some people who preordered that haven't received their Pandora yet.

Everything that could have gone wrong did - sometimes more than once.  Everything from part suppliers lying about stock to manufacturer screwups to licensing and regulatory issues.  Every time it looked like things were back on track, something else would go wrong and everything had to be put on hold for another couple weeks or months while it was fixed.  In the end, what was a cutting-edge SoC in 2008 was barely still mainstream by the time most folks got their Pandora.  I have one, and while the specs may be a bit dated now, it's still a fun little device and I don't regret paying and waiting.

---

The point of all this isn't ""Quit yer whinin', you kids don't know how good you have it!"".  The point that designing and manufacturing a computer from scratch is neither easy nor cheap.  When a couple guys with lots of ideas and ambition try to get something like this made without *also* having lots of money and experience, there are going to be problems.  You just have to accept that.

That's not to say that when a Toshiba or a Samsung makes a new device they don't have the same problems, but they can just buy their way out of them.  They have the cash reserves to cover screwups, and the pull with suppliers and factories to get stuff when it was initially promised.  They also don't have a bunch of people who have already paid for the device breathing down their necks, asking if it's done yet.  All these setbacks and delays are *totally normal and expected* when developing a new product.  They just aren't expected by you because you've never developed a product before.  Perhaps they weren't expected by the RPi makers for the same reason - and that leads to promises that cannot be kept.  There's nothing malicious about it, it's just lack of experience.

So relax.  All things considered, the RPi isn't all that far behind schedule.  It will probably be delayed a few more times before people start receiving them.  It's possible (though I think not likely) that they won't even ship before fall.  That's the price you pay for signing on to hobbyist projects like this.  

If that's not acceptable to you, don't preorder one.  Whenever the RPis finally do go into proper production, they're going to make a lot of them.  You can buy one then and get it within a couple days of placing your order.  I promise you it will save a lot of anger and anxiety on your part to just forget about the project entirely until they're ready to sell you one from stock.  And those of us who have gone through situations like this before aren't really interested in your opinions about how this is ""totally unacceptable and probably some sort of scam"", because we know it's not.  It's just the way these things go.

I've heard some people have gotten their units very quickly not too long ago by ordering from other vendors.  Has anyone had any luck recently with quick shipment to the US?

Update!
So, after I cancelled my order I figured I was done with RS... I have since learned that they are not done with me...

I have received 3 emails in quick succession today.  The first apologized for the delayed response to my query and that they could not cancel my order because it was shipped already!  The second was sent 2 hours after the first one and was a word-for-word copy.  The THIRD email, sent 9 hours after the second one stated that my Raspberry Pi was ""dispatched"" today and that I will be getting the new remodeled B board with 512 MB or RAM.

as a FreeBSD user."	aftli	38	7	14	"Hello! I'm a FreeBSD user, and I'm not really used to most Linuxes. While I wait for FreeBSD to be ported (albeit probably without video acceleration due to the closed source drivers), I chose ArchLinux for my Raspberry Pi. I like how minimal it is (it doesn't even include a C compiler!), and it's apparently based off of ~~Gentoo, and I like their idea of the ""portage"" system (similar to FreeBSD's ports collection)~~ CRUX, which has a lot of BSDisms.

Don't take anything here as sage advice, as I'm not exactly a Linux expert. It's not comprehensive, but it definitely contains a few solutions I had to Google for. If you spot anything off, let me know! This is just sort of a journal of my first day with it, perhaps it will help some of you get set up with ArchLinux. I'm not aiming to type out a *complete* newbie guide here, so if you happen to find this and you have questions, just ask!

 * I used Win32DiskImager and the ArchLinux ISO available from the [Raspberry Pi downloads page](http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads). This was easy enough. The default username is ""root"" and the password is ""root"". You can use the `adduser` command to interactively add another new user.
 * I discovered once I booted that the remainder of my 32GB SD card was left as unpartitioned space. Apparently sometimes Win32DiskImager sorts this out automatically, but it didn't work that way for me. I used the [GParted live CD](http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php) to fix this and resize the main partition. There might be easier ways, but this was easy enough for me as I just mapped the SD reader as the only hard drive in a VMWare OS, and booted the CD.
 * Edit `/etc/rc.conf` to your liking. It's pretty self explanatory. I'll get back to a few of the things in there later.
 * To get sound to work over HDMI, edit `/etc/rc.conf` and change `MODULES=()` to `MODULES=(snd-bcm2835)`.
 * There is a [beginner's guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Beginners'_Guide) to ArchLinux on their Wiki. You can start at the ""Post-Installation"" section, as we've already done the prior stuff. Here I learned that ""pacman"" is the package manager for ArchLinux, and it's easy to upgrade the entire system and all installed packages. As root, the following will upgrade the base system and all installed packages:

          # pacman -Syy    
          # pacman -Syu    
  
 * Packages are installed with `pacman -S &lt;packagename&gt;`. To search installable packages, use `pacman -Ss &lt;search string&gt;`. You'll probably want the ~~""gcc"" and ""make"" packages~~ `base-devel` package to build most stuff.
 * Various things in `/opt/vc/bin`, which appear to be specific to Raspberry Pi (like `/opt/vc/bin/tvservice`) appeared to be broken as shipped with the image I downloaded. They couldn't find  some shared dynamic libraries.  This was easy to fix:
 
          # echo ""/opt/vc/lib"" &gt; /etc/ld.so.conf.d/06rpi.conf &amp;&amp; ldconfig
   
 * By default, ArchLinux allocates memory 50/50 between OS and GPU. This means 50% OS, 50% GPU. For my  purposes, it makes sense to allocate more to the OS. In /boot, there are several ""arm_XXX_start.elf"" files. The ""start.elf"" file determines which one is actually used. More information is [available here](http://www.greenhughes.com/content/arch-linux-and-desktop-adventures-raspberry-pi). I used the one which allocates 224MB to the OS:
   
          # mv /boot/start.elf /boot/old_start.elf &amp;&amp; cp -p /boot/arm224_start.elf /boot/start.elf
   
 * You'll probably want to update your Raspberry Pi firmware. To do this, install rpi-update:
 
          # wget http://goo.gl/1BOfJ -O /usr/bin/rpi-update &amp;&amp; chmod +x /usr/bin/rpi-update    
          # pacman -S ca-certificates    
          # pacman -S git    
          # rpi-update    
 
 * If you're a Linux user, you probably like to use `sudo`. I'm not a fan of it, but it seems to be ""The Linux Way(tm)"". To install it, run `pacman -S sudo` as root. As a FreeBSD user, I'm a fan of the ""wheel"" group, which allows use of `su`. To get `sudo` to work for users in the `wheel` group, you need to edit the `/etc/sudoers` file. According to the ArchLinux documentation, you're apparently supposed to use  `visudo` to edit this file. I just used `nano` with no negative effects. Find the following line in the file and uncomment it:
  
          %wheel	ALL=(ALL) ALL
 
 * There are many things in `/boot/config.txt` that can be modified. This even includes overclocking, but more importantly, it deals with video modes. On my Samsung TV, I had ""black bars"" on the top and bottom of the screen, in addition to not being able to select 1920x1080 resolution in X. More information on this file is [available here](http://elinux.org/RPi_config.txt). I'll give you my solution for my Samsung TV (over HDMI), but YMMV. To list the modes supported by your monitor, run `/opt/vc/bin/tvservice -m CEA` (this command will not work without the above fix for the related shared libraries). Oddly, sometimes these changes didn't survive a reboot, sometimes they did. Sometimes I'd be left with half a file after a reboot with the other half mysteriously missing. Make a backup first. Anyway, to get my TV to work, the solution was (find these values and change them):
 
          overscan_left=0    
	      overscan_right=0    
	      overscan_top=-20                   # Yes, that's ""negative twenty""    
	      overscan_bottom=-20    
	      framebuffer_width=1920    
	      framebuffer_height=1080    
	      hdmi_mode=16              # That's 1080p at 60hz, more available at the above link    
 
 * To install X: `pacman -S xf86-video-fbdev lxde xorg-xinit dbus`. This installs 'LXDE', an *extremely* minimal X window manager, which is also the one which comes with the Debian Raspberry Pi default  installation. It includes basically nothing though, even less than the Debian version. To get LXDE to start when you run `startx`, modify `~/.xinitrc` (it doesn't seem to want to run as root for me, so do this as your `wheel` user you created earlier):
 
          $ echo ""exec startlxde"" &gt; ~/.xinitrc
 * Firefox is not available for ArchLinuxARM, and I didn't feel like building it - it takes a very long  time even on my modern 12-thread machine. Chromium is also not available. I opted for midori (a KHTML  browser, like Chromium) instead:
    
          # pacman -S midori  
 * To get nicer fonts in X, `pacman -S ttf-dejavu`. The traditional MSFonts packages don't seem to be available for ArchLinux ARM. If anybody has more information, I'd appreciate it.
 * I wanted the Pi to be visible to my Windows machine for transferring of files, so of course Samba is the logical choice. A quick installation guide is [available here](http://archlinuxarm.org/support/guides/applications/samba). I haven't used Samba since pre-3.x, but it's working well enough for me. `pacman -Sy samba avahi` will install Samba. You can copy the sample configuration file `/etc/samba/smb.conf.default` to `/etc/samba/smb.conf`, but be prepared for a lot of reading and changing things. According to `man hier`, `/srv/` seemed to be the most logical place to put media and such on this Linux distro, though I'm not sure if it's really the correct ""ArchLinux Way(tm)"". You'll want to follow all the directions on the above link, including making a guest account and using `smbpasswd` (which I read is deprecated for Samba &gt; 3.4, but it worked for me). Here's my configuration:
      
        [global]
          workgroup = YOURWORKGROUP
          server string = Raspberry Pi
          netbios name = raspi
          security = share
          load printers = no
          printing = bsd
          printcap name = /dev/null
        ;  disable spools = yes
          log file = /var/log/samba/%m.log
          max log size = 50
          dns proxy = no
          socket options = TCP_NODELAY IPTOS_LOWDELAY SO_KEEPALIVE SO_RCVBUF=131072 SO_SNDBUF=131072 SO_KEEPALIVE
        
        [media]
          path = /srv/
          read only = no
          public = yes
          writable = yes
          force user = root
 * To get Samba to run on boot-up (or any other daemon you install), add it to the list of daemons in `/etc/rc.conf`. It's at the end of the file. For example:
 
           DAEMONS=(!hwclock syslog-ng network openntpd @netfs @crond @sshd samba)
 * VLC is installable via pacman, and it works. I even have sound over HDMI (probably because of the above modification to rc.conf). 
 * Here's a [nice RasPi desktop background for LXDE](http://tomg.co/images/Raspi-background-tomg.co.png). Put it in `/usr/share/lxde/wallpapers`.
 * I got DOOM ][ to run. Install prboom (`pacman -S prboom`). The WAD file belongs in `/usr/share/games/doom/` (I used the DOOM2.WAD file from my Steam copy). Then just run `prboom` from an LXDE console (Raspberry Pi crashes if you attempt to do this from a non-X command line).

* small in size
* low power
* cheap
* large community already

Cons:

* 256MB RAM
* ARM based (most software for carputers are x86)
* no GPS/BT

* no VGA (most touch screens do not have HDMI/DVI connections)

Biggest community here: http://www.mp3car.com

Things to figure out:

* GPS and BT
* Power
* speaker integration
* Steering wheel HU control integration
* OBD-II adapter (see if [FreeDiag](http://freediag.sourceforge.net/) compiles/runs on ARM)

Trying to drill out a hole for the hdmi cable was inconvenient, as it would have destroyed the latch mechanism of the case I was using. To get in the spirit of halloween, I'm running my pi headless.

These instructions work on Mac and linux, you can make them work on windows if you install an X display for windows. I'll explain what's going on after the instructions:

First you need to install Xnest on the raspberry pi. You can either open a terminal on the pi, or ssh into it with the instructions below. Then install it with: sudo apt-get install xnest

0. Only if you're using a Mac: Open up spotlight and search for the ""X11"" app. This opens up a shell where you can type the rest of the commands. You can do this straight from the terminal in linux.
1. ssh into your raspberry pi using the -X paramater: ssh -X pi@192.168.X.X
2. Enter the password for your user account.
3. Type: Xnest :1 &amp;
4. Press enter and type: lxsession -d :1


**What is going on here?**    

I hate VNC with a passion, but I wanted some way to get at the desktop interface on the machine; enter a remote X session. A bit of a linux lesson first though. The linux ""desktop"" is built from 2 different layers, the window manager and the X session. The window manager is the application that displays all of your applications on the screen; it decides window overlaps the others, who has the window focus, and how to minimize a window (among all the similar tasks it handles). The interesting thing about the window manager is that it's just an application like any other. The important part in this setup is the X session (known as Xorg, XFree, Xfree86, etc). This is what actually draws things to your screen. It takes the pixels and descriptions from the window manager, and displays them to your given monitor. The really cool part about X is that it's built around networking. What that means is that you can run an application on one linux machine, and have it display on another.

    
Do you have a netbook that runs firefox like a dog? You can run the firefox application on your beefy desktop and display the program on your netbook; all the work is done on the desktop. Normally you only do this with one program at a time, but we're going to display the entire window manager on a remote PC.

**Here's what's actually going on in those commands:**

If you're using a Mac, Apple has actually included an X application you can use to display remote applications. We're going to fire that up and use it to display the ras_pi interface. When you ssh into the pi with the -X paramater, ssh opens up a special tunnel that allows X traffic to pass through. Without this option enabled, applications won't display on your client. Xnest requires some explanation, this is actually an application that works as an X server by itself. This application is running on the pi, and the window manager can run inside it without ever knowing there isn't actually a monitor attached. The ""colon 1"" part of the command is telling the application to open up a ""virtual display"" numbered 1; other applications can connect to this virtual display to show their interface. When you type in this command, you'll just get a blank screen because we haven't started the window manager. Finally, we'll start the window manager (LXDE by default, on the pi). The ""-d :1"" tells the window manager to attach to the virtual display 1 where Xnest is listening.

**tl;dr?**

So what all this jargon means is that you now have the full raspberry pi desktop running in a window on your PC. There's a bit of lag, but nothing near what you'd get with VNC. As an added bonus, all your data is encrypted, if that's worth anything to you.

Well, enough of you wanted one, that I redesigned the board with cost in mind. The design is now finished and ready to go out to the PCB fab. 

The new board can be fitted with either a LM7805 Linear Regulator, or OKI-78SR-5/1.5-W36-C Switching regulator (as suggested by a fellow redditor) includes filter caps, reverse polarity diode, over voltage protection, and a replacable fuse. Output is 1.5A @5v, input 9-36V (~14V is probably max for 7805 version)

All parts are thru-hole so it is easy to solder together. Design files, parts list, etc will be available once the first batch ships. 

Bare PCB $10usd +postage

Complete kit with 7805 $20usd +postage

Complete Kit with OKI-78SR-5/1.5-W36-C $25usd +postage

for an assembled/tested board, add $15 to whichever kit you want.

I am about to order the first batch of PCBs, there is a two week turn around for them, so If you want one, Send me a message. If you have any ideas/suggestions, let me know!

I will try to put up a website or something for this sometime later this week, until then, this is the place for info.

4) is there room for any other service?

I want to make this accessible from any browser/smartphone. If I go the FTP route, I know there are apps for most of the open protocols I have described. Are there any premade web clients for FTP and IRC that I could just load into my webserver?"	t5_2syto	True

I'm a student who uses the Raspberry Pi regularly for different things, and I decided to write an iPhone application where you can send common tasks such as ""Shut Down"", ""Restart"", or ""CheckTemp"" remotely via SSH. The app simplifies it by eliminating the command line, and just by using big red buttons :) If you have a web server running on the Pi, you can even upload HTML pages written directly on the app. Any suggestions and feedback would be great!

The thing is definitely going to need a couple of speakers, but I want to leave the headphones port free so people can plug headphones in if they want. I'm also going to need some buttons for things like skipping tracks and a volume knob.

__Edit 3__

&gt; ""[...] I suggest perusing adafruit's products. Ladyada offers a nice little pi breakout board.

That looks like the direction I'll go in, and I'll probably go with USB speakers for the first prototype. Thanks guys!

I registered my interest on the Raspberry Pi homepage in October. Still have the confirmation email, even. So like everyone, surprise surprise, 4 delays later, Feb 29 comes along and the rules of the game changed. I registered interest with Farnell that fateful night. Luckily twice, with two different email accounts, because only one actually stuck. But alas, that was not to be. I have not gotten an invite to buy from them.  
Next up, later that day on the 29th, I found a way to pre-order it from Newark. Which I did. Not just placing interest, they actually ran my credit card. I had a crappy May delivery date, but at this point, May 11th isn't that far away.  
By March 3rd, I found a link to buy it on Allied Electronics. Which I promptly did, thinking it'd be wise to hedge my bets and buy from as many suppliers as I could. Again, it was an actual purchase and ran my credit card.  
Here we are 3 more delays later, April 17th, and RPi foundation has the hype machine in full force, did they ONLY ship these things to people who would tweet about it? At this point, when I get one, nobody is going to hear a word out of me, I'm so pissed off. Anyways..  
I decided to check on my orders this afternoon. I called Allied because it wouldn't let me log in. Dialed the toll free number on their website, and was told by the guy who answered, AFTER I gave him my order number and got an awkward silence, that it was a web order and there was nothing he could do for me, he was just a regional sales office. WTF? Finally figured out that I had to MAKE an account on their site before I could run my order number and check the status of the order. At which point the site told me my order didn't exist?!?! I found a local sales rep for Allied and forwarded my order confirmation number to him, he, again, said he could do nothing for me, and gave me a link to a page to register interest. I don't want to register interest! I am a paying customer, I want a status update!!!
Next is Newark. I called them and spoke with the person who clearly had the worst job in the world, he was very appologetic and thoroughly blamed the RPi foundation for the clusterfuck. I told him he was preaching to the choir. Pretty much said my order was at their mercy. Said they were promised 10k and it doesn't look like they'll even get 10k at this point, but doesn't even know when their limitted supply will ship out.  
I'm just thoroughly unhappy with this whole thing. It's an overhyped underproduced clusterfuck. I want the Pi I was promised in November when I registered my interest."	t5_2syto	True

All's good, but some of the emulators like PS1, NeoGeo MAME or the Sega Genesis emu aren't working.

The Sega emu just completely crases my Pi when I try to play (I'm testing it using the game ""Flicky"" if it makes a difference) and I have to power cycle the Pi.

The MAME emu trys to play the games but it goes back to the selection screen. When I check the terminal it says something like ""game no supported"". I have tested MAME with Mortal Kombat 4 and Metal Slug 3 and 5.

The PS1 emu does the same as the SEGA one, I tested it with ""Crash Team Racing"".

Looking for some tips... I want to make my RPi a download manager... So I send it a link (through a web interface perhaps?), and it should start downloading it or add it to a queue of downloads. It should store the file to a USB or a network location.

I've never properly used an RPi before, so I'm pretty much a beginner. I can get myself around the tricky coding stuff though. Any ideas on how I can achieve this?

The sole purpose of the RPi will be as a download manager. So I don't want it booting into the OS and stuff. I've read stuff about FatRat, Aria2 and uGet? fully confused.

Cheers in advance!

I said that this would be highly expensive and mentioned that I could probably set up a cheaper version for her given a bit of a budget using some rpis.

They need around 4 devices to share between 8 classrooms, so 5 pi's in total. One as a central hub and the others to stream the music to. 
If I go for the cheapest model we're talking £120 for the pi's alone. 

I'd also need wifi adapters, power sources, SD cards and potentially cases (but I could design those myself and 3d print them at my university (on an engineering degree and could probably talk my lecturer into letting me do it)
 
Can the pi itself output audio to simple speakers through audio out? 

I have little programming experience and while i'd like to learn, it'd be a lot easier if there's a pre-built OS capable of this.

My main issue is needing some form of output device, are there any really cheap little LCD (or otherwise) screens that'd suit this purpose?

I have a lot of knowledge of electronics and electrical engineering, but little practical experience working with circuits. This is going to be a long term project and at the end I hope to have a fully enclosed gaming console running a custom operating system and games that I will be making myself (plus whatever else I can support). In doing so I hope to learn a lot more about low level Linux code and electronics in general as well as have a pretty awesome showpiece/portable portfolio for conferences, job interviews, impressing colleagues, and whatnot.

I'm building my own Linux kernel and OS using Linux From Scratch, using the GPIO for digital inputs from a directional pad and at least four buttons, outputting to a 3.5"" TFT display hopefully with the option to go full 1080p using the HDMI out, and running all of this from a battery pack while keeping the option to use an adapter. Making everything work isn't an issue so bring on the tough workarounds. 

My problem now is finding the best peripherals to use in order to get the most performance I can in the smallest package. I'm hoping to keep the profile under 3"", and keep the other dimensions small enough that it can easily fit into my pocket.

I need the following:

- Smallest possible 5v battery pack (stepped up 3.7 or a higher voltage stepped down would also be fine), that can run all of the above for at least 3-4 hours.
- The best option for wiring the buttons with possible analog hookup for joysticks. I'll probably stick to a breadboard for prototyping, but I imagine I'll need something more permanent since durability is going to be important
- A service where I can provide references for the case I want to use and have someone make it for me either by machining or 3d printing (won't need this for quite some time though)

My one stipulation is that I want to do as much of the work on my own as possible. I just want to be pointed to the right place to start looking.

Thanks Reddit!

1327262095.0	orrs4	Powering a wearable computer	devnot	33	9	25	"I'm building a wearable computer with the Raspberry Pi and need to figure out a good way to power it. I'll be using a set of video glasses(with a hdmi to vga converter box), 1-2 webcams for AR, a bluetooth and a usb dongle, and a powered usb hub. 

In total, I estimate that I'll be consuming about 5-10 watts. Whats the best way to power this computer? I assume that I'll need a 5 volt regulator but am not sure of the best kind of battery to use, or how to charge it.

1326198254.0	oar3z	"How much would it cost in electricity to 
run a Raspberry Pi 24 hours a day for a 
year? My guess inside."	Adamsky	29	3	19	"Based on the Model B which is 3.5w and assuming that the cost of electricity is £0.16 per kWh would the cost of running a Raspberry Pi for a year go something like this:
 
 

3.5w ÷ 1000 = 0.0035kWh &lt;- Energy consumed in 1 hour, and.

24(hours) x 365(days) = 8760 hours in a year, So...

0.0035kWh x 8760 (hours) = 30.66kWh consumed in a year.

Which at the price of £0.16 per kWh would be.

30.66 x 0.16 = 4.9056 or £4.91




I know there are no moving parts and I haven't included the cost of any connected hardware such as a monitor, but this seems extremely low as the electrical cost of having the Raspberry on for 24/7 for a year.

Am I doing it wrong, or is it really that cheap to run.




Edit: maths typo

Edit: The 3.5 watts figure is based on the wikipedia article and I'm not sure if this is at max CPU load or idle. Regardless though, it's still bloody cheap to run.

1375431367.0	1jjxsg	RPi as network transcoder	crustypants	29	3	10	"I know that there are various projects for transcoding video for streaming from the RPi, but i don't want to transcode in real time.

I want it to scan a network share, transcode any video file which appears into a standard format (which can then be used across my various devices), and then delete the original file.

I have Sabnzbd and Sickbeard on my Synology NAS (which is great), but the NAS does not have enough power to transcode the files. Issue is that i don't want to use my desktop to process the files (or run a Plex server - my current set up), and as my RPi is always on the network, i was hoping it could utilise its hardware encoding capacity to do this satisfactorily and at low power.

Does anyone have any thoughts?

1374810203.0	1j2qnv	Use a raspberry pi to make a portable wifi mesh network for speech communication in a canyon?	verdagon	35	9	22	"Hey everyone! We play a massive game of Humans vs Zombies (basically nerf tag) in a small series of mini-canyons in my hometown, and we're looking to improve the communication between moderators and organizers (about 10 of us altogether, managing 80ish players).

We've used cell phones, but some spots are dead zones, because of the terrain. We've used regular handheld radios, but the range isn't good enough (the entire game field is perhaps a mile across, and with hills inbetween, the radios don't stand a chance).

So, being an engineer, I devised the most complicated solution possible. Could I make 30 of my own little handheld radios by connecting:

 * a raspberry pi
 * a little microphone
 * a little speaker
 * a battery
 * a wifi chip

And then I could, perhaps, put some of these in strategic high-up locations in the canyons, so that they can pass along packets all up and down the canyon.

The raspberry pi would be involved mainly so I can digitize the audio, packetize it, put a header on each packet, so I can keep track of what bit of audio has been passed along already. It's a measure against feedback loops, of two repeaters endlessly repeating what each other says.

How possible would this be? Thanks!"	t5_2syto	True
1373639927.0	1i5kx4	Streaming Server with Raspberry Pi?	discospank	32	8	10	"Hi All,

New Pi user here and for my first project I want to be able to stream video from the Pi to multiple tablets.  

I have this working more or less using the airvideo guide that's floating around out there, but the 1 problem I'm trying to crack is, can I stream the same video to 2 iPad's with synchronized playback.  I'm think about something like VLC multicasting where the server plays the video and the end devices just ""tune in"" to the movie already in progress.

My reasons are for a roadtrip I want the kids to watch the same movie so there's no fighting, also this would simplify audio as I could just plug in 1 iPad into the van's input and not here 2 out of sync audio streams... headphones not an option.

Anyone have any ideas?

Thanks."	t5_2syto	True
