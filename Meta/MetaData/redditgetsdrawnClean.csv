1356621527.0	15irsw	Mod post, please upvote for visibility. We'd like your opinion about possible tweaks 'n changes	ItWillBeMine	278	30	53	"Hi everyone,

First of all, wow, we're doing great, huh? One of our artists made it to the front page of [/r/all](/r/all) this morning - I'm pretty sure that's the first time that's ever happened!

Secondly, apologies for the light moderating lately. All three mods have been busy with work/school/holidays, but we're back in business now. Please message us if you need anything.

The purpose of this post is to take your temperature on a suggestion I saw in a comment thread. The complaint is that it's too difficult to find completed works of art, because there are so many filler/stupid comments. I agree that there are too many filler/stupid comments. The suggestion is to only allow comments that are actual artistic responses to the photo in question. I'm leaning toward yes on this idea, but am hesitating for two reasons:

1) It requires a lot more modding to go through and delete unnecessary comments (which will happen), and 

2) I want to see how you guys feel about it first.

I assume people will have questions for the OP, but those could always be PM'd directly to the OP. Let us know what you think! Any other feedback is welcome as well. Thanks!


EDIT: Thanks for your feedback! We're going to do a one-week trial of artistic comments (and their children) only. Let us know what you think!"	t5_2tjl7	True

Normally we pick some of the best work from the week and link to it, but we received feedback this week that artist features should be more in-depth; accordingly, here's ALL the amazing work Ricky has done for us this week!

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/KGVSk.png) is a photo by user kristiethe, and [here](http://i.imgur.com/yePhs.png) was Ricky's response (Ricky, I'm gonna call you Ricky, because I don't want to assume gender). :)

And of course our very own (and very talented) Artector posted [a photo](http://i.imgur.com/epNpf.jpg) this week, and [here](http://i.imgur.com/dLRmV.png) was Ricky's response.

Last but not least, user MorganJames submitted [this](http://i.imgur.com/rL6nh.jpg) photo, and [here](http://i.imgur.com/NjRJQLN.png) was Ricky's response. It turns out s/he can do animals just as well as people!

We had a third mod, but he has done very little in the past few months (though he was great as well). I mod when I can, but my schedule is erratic, so I'm either here a lot or not here much at all.

New mods are needed, given the recent influx of subscribers. We went from 1000 to 6000 subscribers in a very short time, and it's become too much to handle on my own. Here are some requirements:

1. You must be a regular user/contributor to the community

2. You must be here daily, at least once


Responsibilities will include:

1. Checking the spam filter frequently and approving posts that shouldn't be there.

2. Deleting posts that are not appropriate for this subreddit.

3. Deleting stand-alone comments that do not contribute art (child comments of artistic responses are okay).

4. Ban users who are abusive and/or who steal art from this community and post it in other subreddits.

5. Responding to moderator mail

6. Helping me make decisions about this community when changes are being discussed


No need to respond in this thread (unless you'd like to). Otherwise, feel free to send me a PM and introduce yourself! I plan to choose sometime in the next week.

User kazuma_k posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/KMRSk6J.jpg) photo of himself, and [here's](http://i.imgur.com/TMdZFlS.jpg) what bbob did with it! Hoooly awesome detail and shading!

Pony_Hawk submitted [this](http://i.imgur.com/cB9xrsEh.jpg) photo of herself, and [here](http://i.imgur.com/ghTz4Bq.jpg) was bbob's response. 

Antelope46 posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/oJHMxhl.jpg) beautiful photo of his friend, and [this](http://i.imgur.com/64f59yj.jpg) is what bbob did with it (which was the piece de resistance of the week for him, in my opinion) - spectacular!

MaxCJ posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/gjgSzF6.jpg) photo of his little sister, and [here's](http://i.imgur.com/HcMvhq5.jpg) what bbob did with it - nailed the mischief of the photo!

Ohmybabooshka posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/SzZd432.jpg) photo of his beautiful step-grandmother, and [here](http://i.imgur.com/TO0F9rL.jpg) was bbob's response.

Madlydecent posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/LKM0DsL.png) photo of himself, and [here's](http://i.imgur.com/rkqJO3g.jpg) is bbob's response.

For a look at bbob in a different medium, [here](http://i.imgur.com/DISr9EH.jpg) are a couple of sketches from this week - so good!

Wait, did I say that submission above was the piece de resistance? No, I think the best was saved for last: User em2d2 submitted [this](http://i.imgur.com/PGljmsQ.jpg) photo and bbob just casually whipped [this](http://i.imgur.com/uaELvxK.jpg) out, no big deal. ;) WOW!

Bbob is a highly creative individual, and a long-time contributor to RGD. I highly recommend that you take a look at [his page](http://www.reddit.com/user/bbobenheimer) and scroll down to see all types of arty goodness - he uses a variety of styles and there are lots of stunners on there. :)

Thank you for being here, bbobenheimer! It's been a pleasure seeing your work in the threads this week. We're happy to have you as our winner! A different artist will be selected and featured each week, and winners get permanent flair next to their names that says ""Award Winner."" Yay for flair!

Winners will also be listed in future Artist of the Week threads for the remainder of the year, will have one of their pieces featured in our banner for the next several weeks, *and* they are added as approved submitters to our new sister sub, **/r/RGDGetsBought.**

Feel free to ask bbob whatever you'd like about his art or process!

Mikeymike10 posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/DmjHDU6.jpg) photo, and [here](http://i.imgur.com/zOqyJKB.jpg) was AL's response.

And finally, our own Model of the Year from 2012, mc8119, posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/Y95kejI.jpg) photo, and AL provided [this](http://i.imgur.com/ttowf2B.jpg) amazing piece - for free! Spectacular!

A number of factors go into selection of Artists of the Week; among them of course are quality and quantity. AL sometimes doesn't contribute as frequently as other artists here; however, he has contributed to our sub consistently for a while now, and the quality of his work is STELLAR. Here are some other pieces he has provided to our sub in the last month:

[One](http://i.imgur.com/QWFMqRS.jpg)

[Two](http://i.imgur.com/0menmoU.jpg)

[Three](http://i.imgur.com/IWcKLXC.jpg)

[Four](http://i.imgur.com/HdpzU3l.jpg)

[Five](http://i.imgur.com/rq3QGEK.jpg) &lt;-- seriously, if I just had a whole wall full of AL's art in my home, it'd be fine with me.

[Six](http://i.imgur.com/KN2UvHG.jpg)

[Seven](http://i.imgur.com/9pYaVUS.jpg)

And there are more pieces that I didn't include! This is only a sampling of the work AL has provided to our sub in recent weeks. Thank you for being here, AvelarLucas! It's been a pleasure seeing your work in the threads. We're happy to have you as our Artist of the Week. A different artist will be selected and featured each Sunday, and winners get permanent flair next to their names that says ""Award Winner."" Yay for flair!

One new thing we're trying, after receiving feedback in our last State of the Union post, is to incorporate an AMA-type style into the weekly winner's thread. So, feel free to take this opportunity to ask AL questions about his art, and hopefully he'll respond shortly! :)

User foxh0und submitted [this](http://i.imgur.com/0Cg8LjS.jpg) photo of himself and his girlfriend, and [here's](http://i.imgur.com/tILgY5w.png) how Dr_Pepper_Spray responded. Wow!

Kriger96 submitted [this](http://i.imgur.com/OJiTOP5.jpg) scowl-y photo, and [here](http://i.imgur.com/D25RKKN.png) was _Pepper's response.

User Ohwait_nevermind submitted [this](http://i.imgur.com/KdOfdl5.jpg) photo, and _Spray submitted [this](http://i.imgur.com/vgRbV8r.png) 'quick sketch,' which happens to be utterly fabulous.

Supercracker98 asked be drawn as he was [riding into battle](http://i.imgur.com/b5d7a9g.jpg), and [here's](http://i.imgur.com/OjDQQFj.png) how _Spray responded. 

As was mentioned earlier, Dr_Pepper_Spray has been a contributor to the sub for many months now, and hangs out as often as he can given his busy work schedule. Despite his limited time, however, his stellar talent is hard to miss. 

Thank you for being here, Dr_Pepper_Spray! It's been a pleasure seeing your work in the threads this week. We're happy to have you as this week's winner! A different artist will be selected and featured each Sunday, and winners get permanent flair next to their names that says ""Award Winner."" Yay for flair! 

We've recently implemented an AMA-style into the winner threads, so feel free to use this space to ask Dr_Pepper_Spray anything about his art or process.

Apologies!

Rules for this thread: Photos, as usual, must be photos of yourself and/or a loved one...but the background must be a jaw-dropping view of nature - forest, mountains, beach, sunset, etc, OR a jaw-dropping view in general (skyscrapers count, if they're, you know, awesome and whatnot). The point is to practice/brush up on nature, landscape, background, and scenic skills. All parent posts must meet this criterion. The more breathtaking, the better! Also, be on the lookout later today for our Pose/Model Request thread. Artists, get your requests ready!

Edit: Just to be clear, people must be in the photos! That is a constant, never-ending rule of this sub. Also, ""meh"" landscapes are not encouraged. Go big or go home, as they say. ;)

Double edit: Photos pertaining to Theme of the Week should be posted as comments in this thread (not as individual posts outside this thread)."	t5_2tjl7	True

1) Draw one of the photos below that didn't receive attention.

2) Post your drawing, both this thread and theirs. Include a link to the post you chose, so we know which to remove from the list.

This isn't a challenge to draw everyone on the list. While we'd love if everyone could get artwork, don't forget about the new submissions that are rolling in. :D

It's currently in the works with mods I_may_be_dead and ChillPenguins, but [here's](http://i.imgur.com/atj2JMf.jpg) what DLFG did to get it started - awesome idea!

DanimalxX posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/LdadoFz.jpg) photo from her Kettlebell contest, and DLFG [delivered!](http://i.imgur.com/6LuYVST.jpg)

Kyleunwin posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/vyyPjm4.jpg) nice Parisian picture, and [here's](http://i.imgur.com/NVqNpiN.jpg) how DLFG responded - DAT ARCHITECTURE!

As mentioned, DLFG has been contributing regularly to this sub for months. Here is just a tiny sampling of other pieces he's contributed to various users:

And there is so much more. I encourage you to go check out his profile for arty-goodness, not just in terms of contributions to our subs, but to other subs as well. 

Thank you for being here, drawnlikefrenchgirls! It's been a pleasure seeing your work in the threads this week (and for the past many months as well). We're happy to have you as our winner! A different artist will be selected and featured each Sunday, and winners get permanent flair next to their names that says ""Award Winner."" Yay for flair! Winners will also be listed in future Artist of the Week threads, and once we get our banner up and running, one of their winning pieces will be displayed at the top of the sub, alongside other previous winners. 

We've recently implemented an AMA-style into the winning posts, so feel free to use the space to ask DLFG anything about his art or process.

1372422545.0	1h8so7	Welcome to the Artist Lounge! RGD's newest weekly installment! (Please upvote for visibility; I receive no karma for this post)	yowtfyo	133	17	111	"Spawned from the latest SOTU, the Artist Lounge offers the finest artistic advice for all you aspiring artists out there... and even for you long time art vets, too. There's always something for everyone to learn. If you missed last week's debut, the lounge affords you the opportunity to ask for advice and help other artists out with words of wisdom. We'll even allow you to call out particular artists. Of course it'll be up to them to respond, but don't be offended if they don't.

Some common conversations include: 

- questions about media/material

- critiques on art pieces

Other points of discussion can also be:

- suggestions on pricing for particular works

- any other forms of art and creativity that artists may have and would like to share

- just about anything you want to talk about; seriously it's an open forum

The only thing I ask is you not let this turn into a State of the Union (that time will come). In other words, keep out discussion of stuff like sub rules and criticism about and suggestions for the sub. Those comments will be removed. If you have something of that sort to bring up please do so thru [mod messaging](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fredditgetsdrawn).  Also note that all artists are welcome to post questions in here. Comments not pertaining to the topic at hand will be discarded as well.

As mentioned in previous posts and comments, Artists of the Week are chosen based on a combination of quality and quantity.

With that said, check out what he's done:

Some jerkface who deleted her post posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/Y7H5jjYh.jpg) photo of herself, and [here's](http://i.imgur.com/qs0Qv3Z.jpg) what Zhim provided. Note to users: Don't delete your posts. We hate that.

Details inside (please upvote for visibility)	ItWillBeMine	129	14	35	"0ncoming_Storm (referred to hereafter as _Storm) has contributed to the sub for a while now, but caught our eye this week in particular with the following works:

User martinaocean posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/ccqpiLu.png) photo of her cute pregnant self, and [here](http://i.imgur.com/nB8pmtt.jpg) was _Storm's response.

Sheltiesnatcher posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/lLkz662.jpg) dramatic photo of herself, and [here's](http://i.imgur.com/OfiYrDN.jpg) what _Storm submitted in response. 

Shayfoxx contributed [this](http://i.imgur.com/ZDmrfjG.jpg) photo of herself, and [here's](http://i.imgur.com/tDRortZ.jpg) what _Storm did with it. Nice!

Alaiwy requested a caricature of [this](http://i.imgur.com/ylndgmU.jpg) picture, and [here's](http://i.imgur.com/z0pEa5F.jpg) what _Storm provided.

Microbeman posted a photo that I'm unable to share because he deleted both his image and his post after receiving art (booooooooooo), but [here's](http://i.imgur.com/tsdqchm.jpg) how _Storm responded to it - too good not to share!

Justaredditor1 submitted [this](http://i.imgur.com/jxcQbsk.jpg) photo of his girlfriend, and [here](http://i.imgur.com/dnfraf7.jpg) was _Storm's response.

Our own talented qtmwhiskers submitted [this](http://i.imgur.com/fbVXZobh.jpg) photo, and [here](http://i.imgur.com/quOfE4u.jpg) was _Storm's take on it. 

Hodgepodgejunk (re)posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/GX9dK9v.jpg) photo, and _Storm has drawn it twice - [here's](http://i.imgur.com/hXs04tT.jpg) his most recent version!

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/ZfYYx#0) is an awesome collection of art from _Storm that is both RGD- and non-RGD-related. Wow!

As he often does, he stood out from the crowd this week with the following works:

He contributed to our [Pose Request Day](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditgetsdrawn/comments/1acude/pose_request_day_please_upvote_for_visibility/) this week and asked for people who were making sour faces. The results were incredible.

User infernoenigma posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/Eddstl4.jpg) photo of his/her child that had just sucked on a lemon, and [here](http://i.imgur.com/32xpIDG.jpg) was bertonnon's response.

User inkathebadger posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/t2FNG0Jh.jpg) photo of an upset young one, and [here's](http://i.imgur.com/1ZGQudB.jpg) what he did with it. Who knew looking at a crying baby could be so satisfying? :)

Our own beloved yowtfyo posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/bfeu5s8.jpg) photo of his daughter, and [here](http://i.imgur.com/rU01jGv.jpg) was bertonnon's response.

Another favorite artist of ours, 0ncoming_Storm, contributed a [sour face](http://i.imgur.com/RgyGGMQ.jpg) as well, and [this](http://i.imgur.com/3vVvSW1.jpg) was bertonnon's response.

In addition to the sour-face thread, user fifteen floors posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/2rpys5Q.jpg) photo, and [here](http://i.imgur.com/Mpx9fR3.jpg) was bertonnon's response.

User akeleie posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/Rux4Vvy.jpg) photo of herself and her father, and [this](http://i.imgur.com/5hYvQU6.jpg) was bertonnon's response.

Want to see more? [Here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ivandiazm/sets/72157626441315734/) is a Flickr gallery of some of his works - ahmaaaazing!

Also, [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrAkzt42DDw&amp;feature=youtu.be) is a totally fascinating time-lapse video of the piece he did recently for user akeleie.

Thank you for being here, bertonnon! It's been a pleasure seeing your work in the threads this week (and every week). We're happy to have you as our winner! A different artist will be selected and featured each Sunday, and winners get permanent flair next to their names that says ""Award Winner."" Yay for flair!

User alexduple posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/qG78KfZ.jpeg) pin-up photo, and [here](http://i.imgur.com/rdai9Gt.jpg) was HDG's response. 

User foyada posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/DDRRz24.jpg) interesting photo, and HDB [responded in kind](http://i.imgur.com/o2ipNWW.jpg).

She was also the only artist to respond to [this](http://i.imgur.com/dziK482.jpg) photo by user ozziesoftballs, [here](http://i.imgur.com/zoFkCOz.jpg).

User zombiepoke wanted to be drawn like a [Viking girl](http://i.imgur.com/f14tnlK.jpg), and HDB [did her thing](http://i.imgur.com/0wkXFxf.jpg)!

She was also the only artist to tackle [this](http://i.imgur.com/fiJGb.jpg) photo by user henraldo, [here](http://i.imgur.com/iL6qeqh.jpg).

User IronsMaiden posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/j1lyTkw.jpg) photo, and [here](http://i.imgur.com/xBdcVrZ.jpg) was HDB's response. 

User Spritza posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/czxVgzx.jpg) photo, and [here](http://i.imgur.com/QW62LIH.jpg) was HDB's response. Whew, I'm getting tired of listing all these, but we've only covered the last three days! HDB hit it out of the park this week in terms of number of users she made happy. :)

Continuing...

User mckinners wanted someone to try [this](http://i.imgur.com/f9twXq9.jpg) photo of herself and her sister, and [here](http://i.imgur.com/nllnNsu.jpg) was HDB's response.

User calico_may posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/JUCHiFb.jpg) photo of her friend, and [this](http://i.imgur.com/vqYcP7q.jpg) was HDB's response. 

9doorsdown posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/FAVTmeJ.png) image of his brother, and [here](http://i.imgur.com/lWnV3mP.jpg) was HDB's response. 

Samphippen posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/CxTSPdC.jpg) hipster-tastic photo (his words, not mine), and HDB [took it to the next level](http://i.imgur.com/qw8xnze.jpg).

User Matzon posted [this photo](http://i.imgur.com/EiiBLCG.jpg), and he loved what [HDB did for it](http://i.imgur.com/Wd1QAPp.jpg).

Chris-Vuki posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/zSEdypx.jpg) photo, and [here](http://i.imgur.com/qpV4HCU.jpg) was HDB's response.

I saved the best for last: Miserable-Chainsaw posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/yeHSExV.jpg) NSFW photo of himself and his...furry friend, and it turns out HDB makes the cutest [watercolor penises ever](http://i.imgur.com/29jHjPp.jpg). ;)

HDB didn't just win because of quantity (although holy smokes, the quantity! There are many that I didn't post, just from this week!). She also won because she is one of the most distinctive and unique artists in this sub. She has a style all her own, and there is no one else in this sub like her. To be able to say that when there are hundreds of artists who have posted in this sub is incredible. Common responses that follow once HDB posts include ""Awww!"" ""That's adorable!"" and ""You should illustrate children's books!""

Thank you for being here, HDB! It's been a pleasure seeing your work in the threads this week. We're happy to have you as our Artist of the Week. A different artist will be selected and featured each Sunday, and winners get permanent flair next to their names that says ""Award Winner."" Yay for flair!

We've recently implemented an AMA-style into the winner threads, so feel free to use this space to ask HDB anything about her art or process.

ItWillBeMine	109	15	45	"As we mentioned in our last [State of the Union post,](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditgetsdrawn/comments/1ch3pr/state_of_the_union_post_please_read_and_upvote/) we have a big surprise that's been in the works for a while now.

One of the recurring comments and requests we get is regarding that of compensation. This is a free sub, and we want to keep it that way. Good Deed subs are hard to find, and we love the joy that this sub brings to everyone. However, the mods here are attached to the artists, and we want to help our artists get the compensation they deserve while keeping things unchanged in this sub.

Solution: We've started a brand-new sister sub, called [RGD Gets Bought](http://www.reddit.com/r/RGDGetsBought/). The quick 'n dirty:

1. Only those who have won Artist of the Week can post there. This serves the purpose of making sure the art posted in that sub is of high quality (or mod-approved quality, anyway, for any of you happen to loathe our list of winners...seriously, who would loathe our list? Have you seen our list?). Accordingly, we'll be adding a new approved submitter each week, as we award a new artist each week, so the pieces will continually change as items get sold and new artists are added. One other benefit of only using our AOTW is that we know them (to some degree), and trust them to deliver art once they are paid.

2. Payments will be accepted via PayPal or Etsy shops only (for now). So, artists, start opening those Etsy stores and/or PayPal accounts!

3. The comment threads are not as strict in that sub as they are here. Feel free to ooh and ahh over the pieces of art, ask questions, etc. The only rule for comment threads thus far is that abuse is not tolerated. 

4. Both artists and buyers who have successfully completed a sale (actually bought something and/or actually delivered something) will get flair that says ""trusted seller"" or ""trusted buyer.""

5. There isn't much over there right now because I_may_be_dead is currently the only approved submitter - artists, you'll be receiving your invites to post today! I can tell you that I'm looking for some new art for my home, so...let's see some choices!

6. Price has to be in the title, along with media, size, etc.

7. Artists of the Week don't *have* to post in the other sub, of course...but you are invited. Also, pieces in our sister sub don't have to be of pieces submitted to RGD. For instance, funisher does landscapes, I believe. So, portraits, landscapes, fantasy...all genres are welcome.

That's all for now! Keep checking back - we're super excited about this, so keep an eye out! Things will be tweaked and changed as we get the ball rolling.

Also, don't get discouraged if there are very few posts today in the other sub - we JUST invited the artists to submit to the new sub directly after posting this thread; they need time to get the messages, create their shops, select and post their pieces, etc. We're hoping to have several up by 24 hours from now. :)

Update: So far there are pieces posted by I_may_be_dead and HotDinnerBatman, and funisher is on the way!

Double update: We've posted over in [r/newreddits](http://www.reddit.com/r/newreddits/comments/1cmqhs/rrgdgetsbought_a_sub_where_you_can_buy_art_from/) to get the word out about BOTH subs!

Funisher's style makes him particularly good with texture, including furs - here's my personal favorite of the week:

1362928950.0	1a0xol	It's time for Artist of the Week! Today's artist is...Vatonescu108! Please see inside for details (also please upvote for visibility)	ItWillBeMine	116	22	50	"Vatonescu108 (hereby dubbed affectionately as ""V108"") caught our eye not just this week, but every week! Let's face it, this accolade is long-overdue. She contributes heavily to our sub not just this week, but every week. In addition, she's the best MS paint artist around. On top of that, she almost always provides in-gallery saves so that the stages of her work are visible, which is useful and educational to budding artists. Finally, she is a warm person and can often be seen in the threads providing support and encouragement to other artists.

Enough praise, let's let the art speak for itself! Here are some of her works, just from this week:

User emmaisabellaa posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/9mOAJ7o.jpg) photo of herself as Bella from Beauty and the Beast, and [here](http://imgur.com/a/gF3EX#0) was V108's response.

User heyheynikki posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/oJmeoaO.jpg) photo of herself; [here](http://imgur.com/a/z9eAK#0) was V108's response.

Here's my personal favorite: Our Theme of the Week was Halloween, and user fatleg posted his [homemade Halloween costume.](http://i.imgur.com/orDe0.jpg) [Here](http://i.imgur.com/NsYnpMD.png) is what she did with it!

User chazwazzle posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/CpmfigZh.jpg) photo, and V108 was the only artist to [respond](http://i.imgur.com/VsZsrtj.png).

User Doxment posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/Zw0x6.jpg) photo of himself, and [here](http://imgur.com/a/ahGpI#0) was V108's response.


User SmallButPowerful posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/7vsdCSX.jpg) photo, and [here's](http://i.imgur.com/1LUTJvV.png) what V108 did with it. :)

Wait! I already said I had a favorite - maybe this is, on second thought. BobbyBadfingers posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/mZGgOVt.jpg) sunset wedding photo, and [here's](http://i.imgur.com/GTnQbuR.png) what she did with it! Beautiful!

And finally, user LindsayChristine posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/AjQt1eWh.jpg?1) photo of her boyfriend and new puppy, and [this](http://i.imgur.com/RfmZye7.png) was her response.

But wait, there's more!

User khem1st47 posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/dPeRWBT.jpg) science-y photo, and [here's](http://imgur.com/a/TDeFj#0) what V108 did with it.

Thank you for being here, TDCJason! It's been a pleasure seeing your works in the threads this week. We're happy to have you as our winner! A different artist will be selected and featured each Sunday, and winners get permanent flair next to their names that says ""Award Winner."" Yay for flair!

1360950669.0	18l9oj	Monthly State of the Union post - please read and upvote for visibility (I receive no karma for this post)	ItWillBeMine	95	11	210	"Hi everyone,

Once a month, we like to touch base with the community and discuss ideas and changes that have recently occurred or that are being considered for the future. With that said, here's the skinny for February - feel free to discuss any or all of these:

1. We removed downvotes this month, both for posts and for comments. We did this because it was requested many times by users of our sub. People were taking advantage of the downvote system and obliterating posts that were perfectly reasonable, and in many cases, downright good. Taking away the downvote option seems to have helped that issue a great deal.

2. We've instituted a new rule that watermarks aren't allowed for photos.

3. We recently began requiring verification for NSFW posts, particularly those that are tied to new/throwaway accounts. This is because we've had issues with false identity in several instances lately. Verification can occur either in the thread or privately with the mods, at OP's discretion. Those that don't provide verification for NSFW photos will have their post(s) removed.

4. Artists, are there any issues/problems coming up for you that we're not aware of? We've been hearing lots of complaints lately that many OP's do not do so much as thank the artists. Should we act on this, or is it an unfortunate side effect? Let us know what you think.

5. Please remember to use the report button when you see abusive comments aimed at either artists or submitters - we'll see the comments eventually, but it speeds things up if you help us out. We check the reported queue often.

That's all we have! We love to hear your feedback. While it's not always guaranteed that all opinions/ideas will be implemented, it is guaranteed that we read and seriously consider every comment. We have implemented a number of user suggestions in the past, and are happy to give our users a voice so that this is a place that makes as many people as happy as possible.

Thanks! We wouldn't have this sub without all of you! Remember to stay tuned each Sunday for Artist of the Week and each Wednesday for Theme of the Week. :)

Edit: Here is a tentative weekly schedule of mod posts we're considering, based on current standards and suggestions below:

Sunday: Artists of the Week (one artist per week is recognized and featured)

Monday: Model Mondays (Artists can post specific requests for photos they're looking for)

Tuesday: Tearful Tuesday? (This name sucks. A roundup of posts from the last week that didn't get a response)

Wednesday: Theme of the Week (all photos must match a different theme, decided each week)

Thursday:

Friday:

Saturday:

Another lovely Friday means another The Artist Lounge, the best place for anyone to request and share artistic advice. 

Some common conversations include:

- questions about media/material

- tutorials and technique

- critiques on art pieces

Other points of discussion can also be:

- suggestions on pricing for particular works

- any other forms of art and creativity that artists may have and would like to share

- just about anything you want to talk about; seriously it's an open forum

The only thing I ask is you not let this turn into a State of the Union (that time will come). In other words, keep out discussion of stuff like sub rules and criticism about and suggestions for the sub. Those comments will be removed. If you have something of that sort to bring up please do so thru mod messaging. 

So, grab a drink, relax, and let's better each other as artists! "	t5_2tjl7	True

Here's the skinny: Pose Request Day is a thread posted once weekly that allows artists to request the types of models and/or poses they want.

We (the mods) tried this intermittently for a while and didn't really get good results. So, I decided to scrap it. 

Some want to see it continue, however, so this is a trial period. For 12 weeks, we'll be posting this thread every Wednesday to see what kind of response it gets. This is Week 2. If you want Pose Request Day to continue, make sure to post a request (**and then please follow through with your art**), and/or check the requests to see if you have one or more photos you can contribute to existing requests. Please only post photos that pertain to the request (if someone asks for photos of nude women and you post a photo of a man in suspenders shaking his fist at the camera, it will be removed).

If you don't want it to continue or you don't care about Pose Request Day, feel free not to contribute (but please still upvote so that others may see it).

For clarification in terms of the RGD schedule, here are the recurring mod posts, in case you want to catch any or all of them:

Every Sunday: Artist of the Week (one artist whose work was exceptionally good over the past week is selected and featured). Posted by myself.

Every Monday: Graveyard O' Forgotten Posts (posts from the prior seven days that did not receive art are listed all in one place - like fish in a barrel!). Posted by ChillPenguins.

Every Wednesday (for the next lil' bit, if not longer): Pose Request Day (Usually people submit photos and say what they want - in this thread, artists can post requests and say what THEY want!). Posted by myself.

At the beginning of each month: Model of the Month (one submitter whose photos were awesome is recognized and rewarded - the purpose is to encourage high-quality submissions in this sub). Posted by meeps114.

In the middle of each month: State of the Union (purpose is to discuss current and upcoming goings-on in the sub). Posted by myself.

Enough housekeeping - go go gadget requests!

Also, please upvote this post for visibility - I receive no karma for this post.


Note: All parent comments in this thread must be of an artist making a specific request. Responses to said requests should be photos, and responses to those photos should be art."	t5_2tjl7	True

For those of you who are unfamiliar with this post, every month we (the mods) open up a conversation with you (the artists, the submitters, and the lurkers/viewers) to discuss the sub, how things are going, and changes that are going to be made.

We pride ourselves on being (at least a little) more diplomatic than most of the other subs on Reddit, in which decisions are made unceremoniously without hearing the opinions of the users. While we don't agree with every suggestion we receive, we do listen to them and many changes in the sub have been made based on user recommendations, such as:

1. Our fancy, kick-ass banner that you see above

2. Our Artist of the Week feature

3. The removal of extraneous comments

4. The creation of a sub for artists to sell their work

5. Our Graveyard O' Forgotten Posts Post :)

There have also been suggestions that we've listened to but have decided not to go with (Pose Request Day just doesn't seem to be happenin', and yes, we are going to keep removing those darn extra comments).

With all that said, here's what's happening at the moment - feel free to give us your thoughts on these things that are up for discussion:

1. Modding. Three out of four of our active mods are having some fairly serious life events at the moment (some good, some bad, some both), and the other one is fairly busy as well. You may have noticed that over the past month, faulty posts and comments take longer to get removed. We'd like to add another mod to the mix. Anyone interested? Write to the mods and tell us why you're interested. :) **Please note: ONLY applications that are sent to the mods (via the ""message the mods"" link in the sidebar) will be considered. If they are posted  here, they are discarded. If they are sent to only one mod via PM, they are discarded.** We'll look at applications for the next several days, and maybe one day soon you'll see a new name (or maybe even two?) over there on the list-o-mods ---&gt;

Warning: Modding sounds exciting, but consists of a lot of busywork. If you can't spend an hour here 5-7 days of the week, please don't apply. You would also be at the bottom of the ole' totem pole, so you'd have to ask yourself if you're okay with those things.

2. The report button. Because the sub has gotten so large and many of our mods are so busy, it's really helpful to use that report button. Regulars who know whats up: please help us out by pressing that bad boy when you see a rule-breaker.

3. /r/RGDGetsBought: What does everyone (sellers, buyers, viewers) think of the new sub?

4. Pose Request Day: Nixed. Officially. We are sorry. We may bring it back in the future, but not anytime soon.

5. Up for discussion: Graveyard O' Forgotten posts. Lately many of our hard-hitting regulars have been absent. I am almost beginning to think that there is somewhat of a curse to Artist of the Week, because our most frequent contributors often win it and then drop off the map. This is not true for all of them (thank you Artector and Yow and _Dead and V108 and several others for sticking around), but many on the winner's list don't post here anymore. 

The ratio of artists to submissions seems less than optimal (at least, it has for the past two weeks or so). Because of this, I worry about the Graveyard post compounding an already existing problem: we don't have enough artists to go around one week, so the next week we post this big list and all the artists attack it at the expense of the current week's posts, which adds to the problem and creates a big list for next week, etc. 

Graveyard is quite popular and I'm sure many would like to keep it - I'm just musing that without enough artists, it may have some pretty significant disadvantages.

6. What is a feature we could add to the sub that would make it more fun for you?

I believe that's all we had for this week! Thanks very much to all of you for being here and for everything you do. There are many people out there who love this sub as much as we do - we've got a great thing going! I really love this little corner of Reddit. Happy Wednesday!

1358437812.0	16r815	State of the Union - please read and upvote for visibility (I receive no karma for this post)	ItWillBeMine	76	12	83	"Hi everyone,

I've been doing this informally for a while now, but beginning this month, we're going to more formally post an ""opinion"" thread of sorts in order to take the temperature of the community, discuss possible changes, listen to your likes and dislikes, etc. While it does not mean that any changes will be immediately made, we do guarantee that we will listen to your feedback and take it into account when making future decisions in this community.

So...how are things for you? Artists, submitters, lurkers, feel free to share your likes and dislikes. 

Here are some additional potential discussion points:

1. One artist recently posted a piece, but it was linked to a merchandise site on which one could buy a t-shirt that had the piece the artist had created on the front. This is my long-winded way of bringing up compensation for artists. Right now, RGD is a completely free subreddit, and that's part of what makes it special. However, surely we all agree that the wonderful artists here should be paid if they want to. What do you guys think of that? Should artists be able to link to merchandise when they submit?

2. We would like a way to showcase a gallery for each artist, but would like to do so in a way that is unobtrusive to the current design of the sub (meaning that posts here will remain 100% request posts). Some potential ideas: artists can leave a link themselves when they post art, or perhaps we could post a link somehow in the sidebar.

3. This isn't really a discussion point so much as a new rule (though we're happy to listen to any feedback) - many submitters lately don't get a response on a photo, so they resubmit the same photo after a few days (and it still often doesn't get responses, usually due to poor quality and/or uninteresting pose or story). I think this should be the one subreddit in which reposts aren't allowed, in order to keep things fresh for the artists and not clog the front page with stale images. What say ye? One of our mods suggested that we could allow reposted images as long as new images are provided as well, so that's another option.

4. We're thinking about removing photos in which the person has a partially chopped off head. Who's excited??? There may be more rules in the future for submitters in terms of photo quality, but for now, the mods have enough work to do, and I think implementing this rule will actually fix a lot of problems. And by ""problems,"" I mean all those partially-headed photos we get every day. :)

5. Quick review of the rules: I just want to mention some rules that get broken multiple times a day, every day. They are usually broken by people who are new to the subreddit, which is understandable. However, it doesn't hurt to mention them again, so here we go: 

Users are only allowed to post once every 48 hours. This keeps people from getting too greedy. Pretty girls in particular tend to have good luck and then turn around and post immediately after. Let's give the kids, old people, guys, pets, and not-so-pretty girls a chance too, shall we? ;)

A lot of posters are submitting personal info, which is not allowed. This is for their own protection, which we happen to care about, even if they don't.

Comments in threads are for artistic contributions only, and responses to them. Comments such as ""You should post in GW"" or ""Is that in Orlando?"" will be removed. In the same vein, I know it's hard (no pun intended?), but hitting on/flirting with submitters isn't allowed. While compliments can be nice, that's not what this subreddit is for. People post here because they want art, and because the line between compliementary and creepy and wanted and unwanted compliments is so difficult to distinguish, it's best just not to do it.

Same goes for abusive comments: ""You're fat,"" ""I'm glad your dad is dead,"" etc. are removed, and repeat offenders are banned after being warned. Submitters should feel like they can post here and not get a lot of insults.

And finally, troll art. Ahhh, troll art. It's so difficult to determine what's intentionally bad and what's unintentionally bad...but sometimes, it's very clear. Any art that was truly given an effort isn't removed. If it's clearly a joke and it's terrible, it is removed. Sometimes it's hard to decide what's what, so the mods rely on the community to help. If you see something that looks like troll art, please downvote it. When it gets into the negatives and we agree, we remove it (and sometimes faster than that if it's very obvious). If the person says something like ""I haven't drawn in years, sorry for the quality,"" then we leave it.

Re: treatment of the mods. We understand that few of you will probably agree with 100% of the information on this page, and that's okay. We like hearing differing opinions. What I ask if that everyone treat the mods with respect, just as we try to treat everyone with respect. I understand there will be disagreements and I will be the first to admit that I've been pretty angry with a few rogue users in my day, but ideally, in terms of communication, if we have a disagreement, we will all discuss it calmly and come to a resolution if possible. This is a good thing to keep in mind going forward. I always hate it when I see other users being mean to the mods, as all of us really love this sub and work our asses off every day to spend a lot of time here and keep the quality high.

That's all I can think of for now! Please let us know anything you'd like - open forum is open! ;)

One redditor posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/c2nWsgX.jpg) NSFW photo of her bum, and hey, GC is called GC [for a reason!](http://i.imgur.com/3qlcrGj.jpg). Sidenote: This redditor deleted her post. Please don't delete your posts. We hate that. Also, she deleted her post in response to a different artist who passed the good natured joke realm and went, um, super inappropriate with it. 

Anyway, I digress! Back to GC!

BuffyArlington posted [this interesting expression](http://i.imgur.com/cFPqTWJ.jpg) of his, and [here's](http://i.imgur.com/Xjj5U8S.jpg) what GC did with it. 

Gameshark56 wanted someone [to draw him with Thor's hammer](http://i.imgur.com/SOYeCNM.jpg), and GC [did totally include a hammer.](http://i.imgur.com/KDsc3f1.jpg) :)

Ckxcore posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/95WzB3Z.jpg) photo of his/her son, and [this](http://i.imgur.com/g8cHBLL.jpg) was GC's response. 

Thank you for being here, Gross_Caricature! It's been a pleasure seeing your work in the threads this week. We're glad to have you as our winner.

1366135191.0	1ch3pr	State of the Union Post - please read and upvote for visibility	ItWillBeMine	62	2	55	"Hi everyone,

Every month, we do a mod post called State of the Union. In it, we let you know about new changes that have recently occurred or that will occur in the sub, and we often ask for your opinions and thoughts on matters if the mods are undecided/on the fence as a group.

Although there are certain parts of the sub that are not up for change at the moment, we will definitely read your feedback and take it into account for future decisions. We pride ourselves on being at least somewhat more democratic than many of the other subs, and many of our changes have been the result of user inquiries and comments (not the least of which is point #1 below).

With that said, here are the main points for April 2013:

1. CHECK OUT OUR NEW BANNER! Isn't it...isn't it beaauuuutiful? Special thanks go out to yowtfyo (for the idea of celebrating our recent Artists of the Week, and for putting together sample images), vatonescu108 (for spending hours trying to educate the mods on how to implement the damn thing), ChillPenguins for spending hours on it as well, and I_may_be_dead for ultimately putting the final thing together and getting her up! Yay! Feel free to use this space to comment on how awesome it is. Because it is awesome. 

2. We have a [new Wiki page](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditgetsdrawn/wiki/index) that contains all the rules of the sub. If you haven't already, we suggest you look it over. There were some rules that have been in place for a while that didn't fit into the sidebar. We're glad to have a handy reference like this so that everything is all in one place. Thanks again to ChillPenguins for making it look pretty and doing the formatting!

3. Here's something we'd like your thoughts on: Pose Request Day. For those unfamiliar with it, we almost always get requests from models who want to be drawn. Occasionally, though, we have artists who want to request a particular pose or kind of model. For that reason, we started a weekly Pose Request thread once per week, in which artists could say what kinds of poses/models they wanted, and anyone could contribute said requests. We're pretty sure we're going to do away with this post, though. The mods keep forgetting to post it, for one (Like, three out of four of the mods. It's a widespread problem). Also, when we do forget, no one seems to notice, so it doesn't seem like it's stirring the hearts of too many people. Finally, when we do post it, the response is really underwhelming. We want to limit mod posts if we can so that it doesn't become too clutter-y around here. So, if you want to save Pose Request Day, speak now or forever hold your peace. And if you agree with the decision to can it, please say so as well. :) We're keeping the posts in this sub as art requests only for now, so let us know if you have any thoughts on this topic.

4. Stay tuned in the next week or so for a big announcement of some very exciting news! This statement is cryptic on purpose. :) We are in the brand-new stages of something awesome that will add a whole new layer to the sub. And that's all we have to say about that. For now.

As always, we want to thank the artists and the models for keeping this sub growing. We recently hit 10k subscribers. At this time last year, we only had a couple hundred subscribers. RGD remains one of the best-kept secrets on Reddit, and we're happy to be here with you to make sure the quality stays high all 'round. I enjoy ""seeing"" so many of you regulars every day - what a wonderful community.

Thanks everyone!

Until next time,

Da Mods

1363441245.0	1aepai	State of the Union post - please read and upvote for visibility	ItWillBeMine	63	11	116	"Hi everyone,

One of the things (we think) that makes our sub stand out (you know, aside from the stellar talent and the fact that we're one of the best Good Deeds subs around) is that we like to hear what the community thinks. Many mods of other subs don't take user feedback into account and don't have any features similar to a monthly feedback post.

Several tips from our subscribers given in our past monthly State of the Union posts have been used to tweak and improve the sub. For instance, we were at one point the Subreddit of the Day last year, after a user suggested that I write them and ask. We also got more exposure after asking the other art-related subs to put us in their sidebars, which was a user tip. We've completely redone our sidebar, have started featuring an artist in-depth once per week, we now remove filler comments, and we have a pose/model request thread once per week. All of these were due to the feedback we received. So, we do take it seriously.

Not everything about the sub is up for potential change at this moment, but there are a few things in particular that we'd like your opinion on, based on how things are going. Here are the main points for today - we'd love to hear what you think!

1. Tracing. Tracing is a serious bone of contention in this sub again and again, with both sides feeling pretty passionate about it. As of right now, tracing is allowed. Most of us have probably seen the arguments for and against tracing, but please feel free to present them below. **Edit: Based on the discussion allow, tracing will continue to be allowed.**

2. How does everyone feel about the weekly mod posts? We've recently decided to discontinue Theme of the Week because 1) the mods kept forgetting to post it, and 2) the response was underwhelming. It was fun, but it seemed like it attracted more photos/submitters than artists. We're definitely keeping the long-standing Artist of the Week and the monthly State of the Union posts. Anyone have any strong feelings on:

Theme of the Week?

Pose Request Day?

Graveyard O' Forgotten Posts?

Model of the Month?

Also, frequent posters: right now we say people can only post once very 48 hours...but there are some whose faces are on the front page every other day on the dot. Should we extend it to 72 hours?

Your feedback is helpful to us; if there is little interest in one or more of the mod posts, we may discontinue them, so as to avoid clogging the threads with mod posts every week.

If there are any other burning issues or hot topics, feel free to bring those up as well. We may not implement every suggestion, but we do take everything seriously. Thanks for making this sub the best one around!

Inquiry for the community? **A pose request perhaps?** There's bound to be someone in the sub to satisfy your request. 

The only thing I ask is you not let this turn into a State of the Union (that time will come). In other words, keep out discussion of stuff like sub rules and criticism about and suggestions for the sub. Those comments will be removed. If you have something of that sort to bring up please do so thru mod messaging.

1) Draw one of the photos below that didn't receive attention.

2) Post your drawing, both this thread and theirs. Include a link to the post you chose, so we know which to remove from the list.

This isn't a challenge to draw everyone on the list. While we'd love if everyone could get artwork, don't forget about the new submissions that are rolling in. :D

1376228582.0	1k55tj	It's time for Artist of the Week! Today's winner is...j-j-j-j! Details inside!	ItWillBeMine	50	6	34	"j-j-j-j (hereafter referred to as ""j4"") is fairly new to the sub, but has already made a splash. In fact, he (I'm guessing here) has been a runner-up for AOTW before. What pushed him to winner's status this week was how he behaved during the flood of submissions and newbies we received on Wednesday due to [this post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1jv6rt/ucreativelyabsent_draws_redditors_over_at/)

While AOTW is awarded for a mixture of quality and quantity, quantity was weighted extra heavily this week due to the fact that our submissions were outta control. But j4 (among others) was on it! Here are some of the pieces he provided within our sub this week:

Seductivelawngnomes submitted [this](http://i.imgur.com/AM93fLf.jpg) photo of herself, and j4 submitted [this](http://i.imgur.com/vbtfPkz.jpg) in return. Wow!

EllieJellyNelly submitted [this](http://i.imgur.com/I37wBzG.jpg) photo of herself and her bird, and j4 gave her [this](http://i.imgur.com/mCaKof6.jpg), showing (some of his) variability in style.

Uptkang submitted [this](http://i.imgur.com/1u9XOv4.jpg) photo of his girlfriend, and [here's](http://i.imgur.com/Zzsp24i.jpg) what j4 created in response. Wow, that hair!

Thatgirlfromthat posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/SQKuvfP.jpg) photo of her sister, and [here](http://i.imgur.com/O3RzrsL.jpg) is what j4 gave her.

Dorothy3693 submitted [this](http://i.imgur.com/3h14OvIh.jpg) photo of herself, and received [this](http://i.imgur.com/MBcjq0t.jpg) from j4 in return.

GigglesMJ posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/Vvmbp6O.jpg) pensive photo of himself, and j4 interpreted it in [this way.](http://i.imgur.com/Tt2jv3E.jpg)

EEKaWILL submitted [this](http://i.imgur.com/rirbelB.jpeg) rather intense photo of himself, and j4 took it in [this direction.](http://i.imgur.com/Lnzxq8P.jpg)

Clarque submitted [this](http://i.imgur.com/m7qklQn.jpg) photo of himself, and j4 made him [a little brighter!](http://i.imgur.com/0cKyGwp.jpg)

Have I mentioned variability of style yet? That_British_Kid posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/Fk8FnO9.jpg) photo of himself, and [this](http://i.imgur.com/EgsdQSa.jpg) is what j4 provided. Keep in mind that many of these were completed on our sub's busiest day - way to go, j4!

DLogo submitted [this](http://i.imgur.com/sxa22Ld.jpg) photo of himself on That Day, and [here's](http://i.imgur.com/rsDmdHE.jpg) what j4 gave him in return.

Fussbudgets submitted [this](http://i.imgur.com/Nvewtdv.jpg) beard-tastic photo, and [here](http://i.imgur.com/pXV6bMt.jpg) is j4's take on it!

Some redditor named ermagerhdkettehs posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/qfNXSq1.jpg) photo and then deleted her post, which means that normally people would no longer be able to see what j4 did for her....please don't do that. We hate that. In any event, [here](http://i.imgur.com/KS2yVfk.jpg) is what j4 gave her.

oooo_nooo (ha - that username tickles me) posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/kHVjz7e.jpg) photo of himself after recently losing 60 pounds, and [this](http://i.imgur.com/qgFHVTF.jpg) is what he received from j4.

BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE! Did I mention that j4 wins not just for quality, but for quantity? We've only covered the last 3 days so far!

WaltWhiteee (IT'S SUNDAY, BITCH) posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/e3En6a2.jpg) photo of himself, as he was one of the newbies brought here by the frontpage post. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/xSw9pe3.jpg) is a sketch that j4 gave him.

Mundyponder posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/ZbaPmrm.jpg) photo of herself, and [here](http://i.imgur.com/5IL9iNg.jpg) is what j4 gave her. 

Lairosiel, another artist who was everywhere this week, posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/Y3jv3J2.jpg) photo of herself. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/cNxIduP.jpg) is a sketch she received from j4.

RogueRetlaw posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/rwvYQf9.jpg) somewhat haunting photo of himself, and [here](http://i.imgur.com/GPIvX4x.jpg) is what j4 provided. And then he posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/CH1KCuZ.jpg). Heh. :)

PixieBomb posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/LRMRb.jpg) photo of herself, and [here](http://i.imgur.com/7jNR2CV.jpg) is what j4 provided in return. So pretty!

Dexterdanger posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/e3JfNu7.jpg) photo of herself in our sub this week, and [here](http://i.imgur.com/3CdUhTL.jpg) is j4's take on it. Gorgeous!

Pmmckee posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/FoZbNdK.jpg) photo of himself and his girlfriend, and j4 [took on the challenge!](http://i.imgur.com/68oCnkQ.jpg)

Still with me? There's MORE!

ashywalker1 posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/iq8aX6O.jpg) photo of herself and her boyfriend, and [this](http://i.imgur.com/7riPJHG.jpg) is what j4 gave in response.

Some buttface anonymous user posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/ScBIbcE.jpg) photo of herself (why is she a buttface? Because she deleted her post, and we hate that. Furthermore, she received art from j4, charcoalgrey, and retinacake, and thanked exactly none of them. Pfffft.), and [here](http://i.imgur.com/8cjTukZ.jpg) is what j4 gave Madame Buttface.

mvigil posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/mr1KDDi.jpg) photo of his friend and dance partner, and [here](http://i.imgur.com/58tMg9r.jpg) is how j4 responded.

Ghanburi posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/Oa4SNUv.jpg) photo of herself in her garden, and [here](http://i.imgur.com/c1dNf4H.jpg) is how j4 responded.

Wow! Aaaaand that took 40 minutes to compile. That's what we like to see! Thank you for being here, j-j-j-j! It's been a pleasure seeing your work in the threads this week. We're glad to have you as our winner. A different artist will be selected and featured each Sunday, and winners get permanent flair next to their names that says ""Award Winner."" Yay for flair!

Winners will also be listed in future Artist of the Week threads for the remainder of the year, will have one of their pieces featured in our banner for the next several weeks, and they are added as approved submitters to our sister sub, **/r/RGDGetsBought,** which currently contains pieces by other Award Winners such as Yew214hhh, MistaPita, AnonDoodily, I_may_be_dead, joyproject, FalcaoLucas, funisher, 0ncoming_Storm, smokeybeard, and bbobenheimer. :)

Feel free to ask j4 whatever you'd like about his art or process!

1371566660.0	1gl4io	State of the Union post - please read and upvote for visibility	ItWillBeMine	45	6	44	"Hi to our regulars and to our new users,

In the middle of each month, we post a ""State of the Union"" post (that would be this post), in which the mods open up this thread as an opportunity for discussion regarding how the sub is going. 

We pride ourselves on being at least somewhat more democratic than many of the other subs. For instance, there are many subs in which the mods seemingly don't care about user preferences. In addition, we have taken many suggestions in previous months directly from these State of the Union threads and implemented them. One example is our banner - yowtfyo asked us many times to create a banner, and now we have one! And it's awesome! Another example is our sidebar. One user said our sidebar was too crowded, so we created a wiki for the rules in order to keep the sidebar somewhat more minimalist.

Please note that while we may not implement the specific feedback or suggestion you make (we don't make every single change that's recommended to us), we will take it seriously. The mods have a discussion each week regarding the sub and we will discuss what we see/hear here in our next talk.

The normal procedure is for us to present a short list of topics we'd like to discuss. Feedback on other topics is welcome, but the topics we provide are what we would like to hear from you about.

With that said, here are a few things:

1. Would anyone miss the RES keyboard shortcut numbers if we removed them? This is a question from V108, our technical wizard. If you don't know what this means, then it's not likely that you would miss them. :)

2. We'd like to officially welcome yowtfyo and vatonescu108 as our two newest mods - they've been modding on a trial basis for the past month, and let's face it - they're pretty great! I'm not gonna lie, our mod team is awesome. :)

3. How does everyone feel about /r/RGDGetsBought? It doesn't seem like it has much traffic these days. Are there types of pieces that you would like to buy that you're not seeing? 

4. Please keep an eye on the rules of the sub. We are in the process of discussing each rule in depth and revising them as needed. We continue to ask that parent comments be comprised of non-artistic comments only, with the exception of ""I'm working on it,"" and, you know, stuff like that. 

5. Artists should feel free to leave feedback (if they want to) regarding why they are not doing a post. This helps OP learn. :) Comments like this will not be deleted, either. So, if something is too blurry and dark, feel free to say it's too blurry and dark, as long as it's said in a non-cruel way.

6. Reminder: Please don't comment on the appearance of submitters. If you wanna insult them or hit on them (or...both?), do so via PM.

7.Regarding discord with the mods, please remember that we are all nice people. We really are. We have men and women in their twenties and thirties modding this place for free, spending hours and hours every day here, walking 'round the threads, encouraging good art and discouraging bad behavior. If a mod pisses you off in a thread (and I'm talking more to the general commenters and submitters right now, as artists and mods here generally do quite well), feel free to message the mods to discuss it. The way to do this is by scrolling over to the right where it says ""message the mods."" We will then discuss what rule or rules you broke and why those rules are in place. Please note that every single rule in this sub is in place for a reason, which means some situation or situations happened that made clear the necessity of the rule. So, if a mod gets onto you, it isn't to be mean (though some of us are admittedly more sarcastic than others). Rather, it is merely to enforce the rules of the sub and to do our jobs.

Anything else on your mind? What do you love about the sub? What irks you? Speak now, or hold yer peace for one more month. ;)"	t5_2tjl7	True

1376407349.0	1ka5ws	State of the Union Post - PLEASE READ	ItWillBeMine	44	3	111	"Hi everyone,

**Warning: This post is hella long and contains one ton of information**

For those of you not familiar with SOTU, we post this thread once per month, in the middle of the month. Even though we are a strict sub in comparison to many others, we also pride ourselves on being somewhat more democratic than other subs, as we have been working with our regular and new users for the past year to make this sub into the great place that it is. This thread is a place for us to share subreddit news with you and to ask your opinions on potential upcoming changes.

In the past, we have taken many user suggestions into account. User suggestions in past State of the Union conversations have resulted in our banner, our Artist of the Week feature, our Graveyard thread, Artist's Lounge, our simplified sidebar, and our removal of non-art-related comments. However, please note that we can't and won't take every single suggestion and make it happen, so please don't take it personally if your idea is vetoed.

This thread is not a place to bash the mods. So, don't do it. ;) Other than that, we will all read and consider everything you have to say.

With that said, we've got lots going on! Holy smokes! Let's get right to it:

The first bit to talk about is all of the crazy growth we've experienced this month. /u/Tru_Fakt, for those of you who don't know, posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1jv6rt/ucreativelyabsent_draws_redditors_over_at/) in /r/pics, which resulted in us going from 14k subscribers to 18k subscribers in ONE DAY! Again, it took more than a year for us to reach 14k subscribers, and we got 4k subscribers in just one day. It was without a doubt one of the craziest, busiest days we've experienced in this sub. You can read more about that crazy day [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditgetsdrawn/comments/1jvqc4/modpost_attention_everyone_we_are_on_the_front/)

As a result of that post, our sub has been busier than normal every day since, due to our permanently larger number of subscribers. We normally averaged 50-70 people in this sub at any given time; since that post, we're averaging closer to 110 people in the sub at any given time. So, say hello to your neighbor, as s/he may be a new person.

The bad news is that this has resulted in a lot of extra work for the mods. Thank you to all the regulars (and to all the new folk with the inclination to read the rules) who have been monitoring threads for us and using that report button. We appreciate it!

The good news is that the influx has brought quite a lot of amazing new artists! Oooooh, the threads have had all kinds of new, neat stuff, and our regulars are continuing to improve and/or trying out new things as well - it's been like an eyegasm up in here lately!

So. That was the traffic talk. Thanks for listening.

We've had some staff changes in the Modhouse - vatonescu108 helped us out for a while and created some AWESOME scripts that make our lives easier. She's no longer acting as a mod, but you'll see her 'round here posting her fabulous MS Paint art, so remember to upvote her and tell her that she rocks when you see her. 

We did add, at the urging of admin /u/deimorz, the famous AutoModerator that auto-mods over a thousand subreddits. You can tweak it to your liking, so right now it's essentially removing all non-imgur posts for us, which is fabulous and takes some of the workload off of our shoulders. We plan on programming (?) it to do more things in the future.

We've had many suggestions that we should take after /r/photoshopbattles' format. For those of you who are unfamiliar with it, using that format would mean that all non-art related comments would be clustered together at the bottom of the threads, and the art-related comments would be at the top. We're not going to use that format anytime soon, because 1) we want the focus in this sub to be on the art (and we're actually feeling a bit more protective of the art now that the sub is growing and all the non-arty folk are coming in and making all their non-arty comments), and 2) we would still have a great deal of work to do, as the mods would still have to go through all those comments and delete the ones that break other rules, such as insulting submitters, creepin' on submitters, asking for or providing personal information about submitters, etc. So, I'm kind of gently preemptively squashing that idea, before anyone brings it up.

But wait, there is still more! We've had some pretty important **rule changes** lately that we want to share.

First, as many of you will remember, we used to have a rule that you couldn't provide any location information. This meant that we were removing many posts per day with titles like, ""Please draw us from our honeymoon to Hawaii,"" and things like that. GENERAL location information is now allowed, which makes submitters happier 'cause we're not taking down their posts, and makes us happier, 'cause we have one less thing to do. However, please don't say in your title or thread that you live at 4752 Coral Drive, or we'll have to remove that bizness. Names are still not allowed, not even first names. Any other personal information that you want to give, such as occupation, birthday, etc., is done at your own risk. Remember this is the internet, and people are nutso. I'm just sayin'.

Next! 

We used to prohibit watermarks as well, for two reasons: 1) watermarks often provide identifying info, such as location, and 2) people were submitting photos with watermarks that were large, distracting, and/or that ran right across the center of the photo. Now that we're allowing location info, watermarks are also now allowed. If the watermark is distracting, we figure the artists will take care of that by ignoring the post.

We've also taken out two rules that were related to photo quality. We don't enforce photo quality, and have no intention to start. This is because photo quality is largely subjective, and also because it's easy for an artist to just ignore a post if s/he is unhappy with the photo for any reason. We encourage you to upvote the high-quality submissions. Though we've considered it in the past, we don't want to remove all cropped-forehead submissions, for example, because some people out there can do great things with a cropped forehead (that means you, I_may_be_dead). We did add a section on photo quality to our FAQ's, though, to hopefully continue to encourage users to post interesting and clear photos.

Seventy-fourth reminder: **Tracing is allowed.** I can't even tell you how many times I've seen someone rudely announce that a submission was traced, and then the artist was all like, ""Uhhh, yeah, duh, of course it's traced, it's not like I was trying to hide that it was traced,"" and then what follows is a debate over the merits of tracing as a learning tool. If you trace, you do that. It is not prohibited. It may save you some trouble to say along with your comment that it was traced, but you don't have to. If you do not trace, do not say rude things to someone who does. As a beginner myself, I know that I simply cannot see perspectives and angles in the same way that more experienced artists can. I don't trace very much, but when I do, I actually find it to be very helpful - almost like a light-bulb moment, when I actually draw angles and shapes in the way they are supposed to be drawn. In addition, some people who trace do a lot of other creative things to the piece before submitting it. With that said, we understand that drawing freehand is harder and that frustration arises when a traced piece gets upvoted toward the top. In that case, feel free to ask if the submission was traced. Just don't be rude about it, please.

The mods are getting tired of breaking up tracing dogfights in the threads. We are going to start removing people who cause those disturbances. It happens way too often.

Submissions Reminder: With the flood of new users, we have a TON of people who have been waiting a day (or less), deleting their ignored posts, and then reposting, sometimes with an alt account. That makes us cranky because it adds a ton of work for us to constantly run v108's fabulous scripts and remove all the sneaky folk with their sneaky, jumping-the-queue submissions. So, reminders for the new people:

* You can only post once per every 72 hours. It will be okay. I recommend spending that 72 hours watching Breaking Bad on repeat, but you can spend it however you wish, of course. 

* Deleting old posts is not allowed. We often hear that artists started on something for someone who deleted his/her post. Don't do that! We ESPECIALLY don't like it when you delete an old post that an artist contributed to. 

* Reposting photos is not allowed. If a photo was ignored, it's likely because something was wrong with the photo. For users who are continually refusing to wait 72 hours and/or deleting their old posts and/or reposting terrible pictures, we're going to start pressing the ban button. So, read those rules!

Whew! This was a lot of information. It's been a busy month.

Don't forget that we still have /r/RGDGetsBought. We want to keep RGD as a free sub, but we also love it when our artists get paid. So go check it out!

Want to sell your art but haven't been selected as Artist of the Week yet? Well first of all, don't worry. We have lots of people that we know will receive it eventually. There is a ton of talent here (Zhim, I'm sorry I said talent)! :) Second of all, anyone can always post in /r/artstore. Third, I've noticed lots of people buying and selling art in /r/forhire. So, feel free to try those avenues as well.

In other news, we've nixed Model of the Month. There wasn't enough interest in it, and we want to keep the focus on the artists, who will find the good models themselves. :)

So...what's going on with you? :) Let us know what you love, what you don't love, and any ideas you're tossing around. Or, if you don't have much to say, feel free to leave us a funny gif. We love funny gifs.

Thanks to the artists, the submitters, the lurkers, and the commenters who give love to the artists. We love this community and it wouldn't be what it is without you.

Thank you for being here, FlyinMayanLion! It's been a pleasure seeing your work in the threads this week. We're glad to have you as our winner. A different artist will be selected and featured each Sunday, and winners get permanent flair next to their names that says ""Award Winner."" Yay for flair!

Winners will also be listed in future Artist of the Week threads for the remainder of the year, will have one of their pieces featured in our banner for the next several weeks, and they are added as approved submitters to our sister sub, **/r/RGDGetsBought,** which currently contains pieces by other Award Winners such as Yew214hhh, MistaPita, AnonDoodily, I_may_be_dead, joyproject, FalcaoLucas, funisher, 0ncoming_Storm, smokeybeard, and bbobenheimer. :)

Feel free to ask FML whatever you'd like about her art or process! However, she mentioned yesterday that she'd be traveling today, so let's leave her lots of fun questions and comments for when she gets back!

1366233362.0	1ck6c4	Pose Request Day, Redux	ItWillBeMine	45	5	74	"Hi everyone,

Here's the skinny: Pose Request Day is a thread posted once weekly that allows artists to request the types of models and/or poses they want.

We (the mods) tried this intermittently for a while and didn't really get good results. So, I decided to scrap it. 

Some want to see it continue, however, so this is a trial period. For the next 12 Wednesdays, we'll be posting this thread to see what kind of response it gets. If you want Pose Request Day to continue, make sure to post a request (and then please follow through with your art), and/or check the requests to see if you have one or more photos you can contribute to existing requests. Please only post photos that pertain to the request (if someone asks for photos of headstands and you post a photo of yourself curled up in a ball with something like, ""Maybe this will work?,"" it will be removed.

So, for clarification in terms of the schedule, here are the recurring mod posts (in case you want to catch any or all of them):

Every Sunday: Artist of the Week (one artist whose work was exceptionally good over the past week is selected and featured). Posted by myself.

Every Monday: Graveyard O' Forgotten Posts (posts from the prior seven days that did not receive art are listed all in one place - like fish in a barrel!). Posted by ChillPenguins.

Every Wednesday (for the next lil' bit, if not longer): Pose Request Day (Usually people submit photos and say what they want - in this thread, artists can post requests and say what THEY want!). Posted by myself.

At the beginning of each month: Model of the Month (one submitter whose photos were awesome is recognized and rewarded - the purpose is to encourage high-quality submissions in this sub). Posted by meeps114.

In the middle of each month: State of the Union (purpose is to discuss current and upcoming goings-on in the sub). Posted by myself.

Enough housekeeping - go go gadget requests!

Hi everyone!

This is only our second go at it, but each Monday we will post links to submissions from the last 1-7 days that haven't received a single response. The formatting is a bit different this time (for those of you who saw it last week):

1) I'm only including posts that got 0 comments, which means some posts were likely left out (if OP left a comment in his/her thread, for instance). Why am I doing it that way? Wellll, I coooouuld sift through all 200-300 submissions from the last week and check every single one, but hey, I worked all day and have a kid to cook dinner for, [soooo...](http://i.imgur.com/aQZHy.gif) ;)

Second change: Instead of listing all titles, I'm arranging the forgotten posts by subject(s). 

It's likely that we'll get a bot to do this in the future...feel free to let us know what you think of the forgotten posts stuff in the comments. Now, on to the good stuff!


**Rules**

1) Find a post that got no attention!

2) Draw it!

3) Post your drawing here!

4) Don't forget to also link the post you chose!!! 

5) Don't forget to also post your art in the thread you chose as well, so that a) OP can see it, and b) we can upvote you twice for being a good samaritan. :)

Here we go! Subject(s) are arranged by category.

Here's the rules: All parent comments must be the artist's requests while the response comment(s) answers those inquiries. Help the models out by being specific! Examples:

* ""Profiles and 3/4 views with interesting expressions please and thank you..""
* ""Mine is really simple I just wanna practice drawing mouths. ""

* ""I need to practice foreshortening. Can I get hands coming toward camera. Preferably with strong side lighting.""

Posters: Try including some references with your request so the models have a better idea what you are looking for. 

Everyone has a camera phone and a human body that are both just going to waste. Get some use out of them you deadbeats! Make those requests and have fun!

First of all, this is a self post, so please upvote for visibility.

I wanted to check in with the regular (and not-so-regular) users of this subreddit to assess satisfaction levels and hear your ideas. In particular, here's what we're interested in:

1. What do you like most about this subreddit?
2. What do you like least?
3. Do you have any ideas for this community that you think should be implemented?

I've seen a few discussion posts recently, here and there, and am hoping many of you will chip in your thoughts here. The more the mods know, the more we can do to make this place better and better.

The number of followers is growing each day; we've gone from &lt;1000 to 1100+ in a fairly short amount of time, and I assume we will get bigger and bigger as word of this subreddit gets out. :)

We will likely be adding 1-2 additional mods this year, depending on growth, and we will be contacting the runners-up to see if they are still interested when the time comes to add more.

Rennzyfeist (hereafter referred to as ""Rennzy"") is a self-described 'cartoony' artist, and completed the following works in RGD this week:

Bladderman submitted posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/JqbLeXi.jpg) photo of himself at his brother's wedding and declared himself to be the prettiest one of all. Rennzy gave him [this](http://i.imgur.com/xKCnutg.jpg). Then she thought about it some more and gave him [this](http://i.imgur.com/Sxxpu3n.jpg). :)

One user posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/rWuU0xo.jpg) photo (alas, it was removed for giving identifying location info), and Rennzy tracked him down afterwards to give him [this](http://i.imgur.com/KpjjTwh.jpg), drawn cartoon-master style. Then she pulled another two-for-one and gave him [this](http://i.imgur.com/8rFHMdL.jpg).

Fellow mod yowtfyo posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/HE5mFE4h.jpg) photo of himself, and [here's](http://i.imgur.com/3mpLoXv.jpg) what she did with it.

She has contributed as a draw-me-and-I'll-draw-you-back submitter as well, with [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditgetsdrawn/comments/1htqf7/hey_reddit_lets_practice_portraits_together_ill/). Within the thread, just_cel posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/saUQ2p7.jpg) photo of her boyfriend to be drawn, and [here's](http://i.imgur.com/wW2Yw26.jpg) what Rennzy provided - love it! Also, wooobbuffet posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/QhtlOW6.png) photo of herself, and [here's](http://i.imgur.com/rhVWU4E.jpg) what she got in return. 

Dea00na posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/QePRX69.jpg) photo, and [here's](http://i.imgur.com/mJf6G66.jpg) what Rennzy submitted.

HedeterWan posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/fgyRkwJ.jpg) popular photo of herself, and [here](http://i.imgur.com/XFwFB69.jpg) was Rennzy's take on it.

BS2000 posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/fO8hkzr.png) photo of herself, and Rennzy took the obvious route and [inserted a bat](http://i.imgur.com/hvuF9Qe.jpg). :)

And now for a bit o' color! Brizzy13 posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/l4AaOkL.jpg) photo of herself, and [here](http://i.imgur.com/G9T13Wg.jpg) was Rennzy's reply. 

Thenerdprincessza posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/AEJ4NeT.jpg) photo of herself, and [here](http://i.imgur.com/7INFoxp.jpg) was Rennzy's take.

Thank you for being here, Rennzy! It's been a pleasure seeing your work in the threads this week. We're glad to have you as our winner. A different artist will be selected and featured each Sunday, and winners get permanent flair next to their names that says ""Award Winner."" Yay for flair!

Winners will also be listed in future Artist of the Week threads for the remainder of the year, will have one of their pieces featured in our banner for the next several weeks, and they are added as approved submitters to our new sister sub, **/r/RGDGetsBought,** which currently contains pieces by other Award Winners such as Yew214hhh, MistaPita, AnonDoodily, I_may_be_dead, joyproject, FalcaoLucas, funisher, 0ncoming_Storm, smokeybeard, and bbobenheimer. :)
