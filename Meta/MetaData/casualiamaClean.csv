1365800932.0	1c8cjz	I had sex with some uncooked pizza dough and it was AWESOME. Casually ask me anything. (NSFW story and pictures)	ImKennedy	1503	327	552	"I did it.

After yesterday's response to [my question in r/sex](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1c5wdt/will_i_get_a_yeast_infection_from_having_sex_with/), I decided to go through with it and have sex with the pizza dough. In short, it was one of the best things in my life. 

I'm having some Internet problems again, so I'll be on infrequently for the next hour. After that, I'll be going hard answering all your pizza questions (or any other questions.)


&gt;I was laying in bed before I had to head to work. I don't normally think about pizza dough when I'm not at work, but today was different. I knew that I'd be able to do this that that had been tempting me for the past several months. I was going to be by myself for a couple hours, so all I had to do was steal a ball of dough and lock myself in the bathroom. I was getting turned on just thinking about it. I masturbated.
&gt;
&gt;I cleaned myself up and went to work. I go in the back door. My boss isn't there, which both surprised and relieved me. I say hi to a coworker. He's the only one here right now, and he's making the dough as we speak. ""It's right fresh."" I think to myself. I walk into the freezer. There sitting before me is several boxes of freshly made pizza dough. I pick one up in my hands. It's still warm. I reach into my pocket where I've hidden a large Ziploc bag and a condom. I stuff the dough into the bag and hide it in my jacket pocket. I intentionally wore a large jacket today, knowing that I'd need to smuggle the dough ball home. I didn't ever mean to fuck the dough at work. That would be unsanitary. If anyone found out, I'd probably be fired. So I get to work, trying not to think about what I've hidden in my jacket. But it's too much for me. I start to get an erection. I grab my jacket and go into the washroom. 
&gt;
&gt;I take off my pants and open up the bag. I poke a hole in the dough and massage it with my hands. I'm rock hard now. I open up the condom and put it on, before I go to town on the dough. After a few minutes, I cum. Not quite as hard as I was expecting, but considering I had just gotten off an hour prior to that, I was satisfied. 
&gt;
&gt;I realize that I don't know what to do with the dough. It weighs about a pound and a half, and it's too big to hide anywhere. Plus the night time staff would find it, and that would be some awkward explaining. There's a knock on the door. My manager is here and needs into the washroom to get changed. I quickly stuff the dough into the bag and back into my jacket before washing my hands. I then went over to another sink and washed my hands again. 
&gt;
&gt;For a few hours after that, I stood there, making pizzas, talking to customers, taking orders. No one that I talked to knew that I had fucked a pizza dough just before talking to them. Someone came in who was getting pizza for a birthday party, someone came in wanting a job, someone came in to talk about how good our pizzas always were. None of them knew. It made me feel dirty, and kind of turned on. 
&gt;
&gt;At the end of my shift I ran home into my bedroom. I grabbed the dough out of my pocket while looking for a condom. I didn't have any more. So I went without. Lying on the bed, moving the dough up and down on my dick. I came again. I then wrapped the dough up in a bag and threw it in the garbage so that no one would accidentally come across it. 

So yeah, ask me anything.

Edit 1: I have better internet now (I think) so I'll be able to answer questions quicker. I'm just updating the story right now and uploading the pictures.

Edit 2: I just put the full story up. I'm working on the pictures now. I""m having a bit of trouble getting them off my phone and onto the computer. But they'll be up soon.

Edit 3: [Here are the pictures.](http://imgur.com/a/t0diP#0) It's 2 very artistic shots. One of the dough, laying there peacefully, not knowing what it had in store. A virgin dough. The second shot is the aftermath. After all that pleasure and all that pain. The result of months of fantasy.

Also, in my comments or in the story, I might come across a bit odd. Writing is a hobby of mine, so when I write about what happened, I write it creatively. But every bit of it is 100% true!

Edit 4: Just to clarify, you can not see my genitals in the pictures. Just the dough and the condom. I've had a couple people request videos of me with the dough, or pictures of me fucking the dough, or [/r/gonewild](/r/gonewild) things. The pictures that I uploaded are not those. I'd be up for that. I'm just going to ask my boyfriend first, to make sure that he'd be comfortable with it.

Edit 5: I've loved answering talking to everyone in these past couple days. It's been a lot of fun. The thread has pretty much died off now, but if anyone drops in I'll still be around to talk to and answer questions.

**Also, because I've gotten a few requests, I'm going to continue having sex with things. I'm going to be starting a subreddit, and would love some people to help me either run it, or have sex with weird things.** If you'd like to be involved in that, send me a message or post on here. If not, then just be ready for my next update!"	t5_2sxwp	True

Well the stories goes like this. I was apart of Arbitrary Day 2013 but since I'm in the middle of a move I used my parents address. My parents knew that a package would be coming and just put it to the side for me. When the package arrived my mother saw my username on it and asked why the hell I would have anarchist in it and that it could come back and bite me in the ass one day. I responded with the username would be the least of my worries. Later over dinner we started to talk about NSA and privacy to which my parents said ""If you have done nothing wrong you have nothing to hide"". I said bull shit, there are things about your life that you would never want me to know and there are things about my life that you would never want to know. With that my mother is now determined to find out what those things are. The first of those things are I'm bi and have dated men(and dad knows)! 

tl;dr My mother found out my username and is likely reading this.

Edit: Hi &lt;insert coworkers name here&gt;, I know you're reading this too!

Edit 2: So I have had fun today answer questions and still will keep answering but I've had a few drinks so the answers might get a little more honest and harder to understand. Drinking and dyslexia will do that. With that said in a few hours I will be hitting the hay but I will answer more questions if there are any in the morning. 

Edit 3: I'm going to bed but if there are still questions I will answer them in the morning."	t5_2sxwp	True

He took my virginity in highschool and I had to wear a tampon for like 2 weeks, despite an hour of foreplay and the world's largest amount of lubricant used ever.

On the rare occasion that it has come up between friends, they always have questions for me about it, so I figured a casualiama might be fun while I have the morning off.

We're white.  We've measured a few times... obviously it's different based on mood/diet/etc.. but it's usually ~8-9"" or so.  Sometimes 8.7"" sometimes 9.1"".. you get the idea.  But the thing is, it's REALLY thick.  He's just a skinny white boy who might barely hit 6ft tall if he has on thick enough shoes. 

**edit:** 10 minutes in and my thread is alternating between 0 and -1 votes AND i've received THREE private messages saying: *""what a stupid idea for a casualiama thread. this is a place for people to talk about their lives and jobs!""* the second one saying *""ur just tryin to brag, u dont really need this thread. also how could u help anyone here with this thread?""* and the third one saying *""since u posted no proof im guessing your fantacy boyfriends penis is like 3 inches lol""*

Not sure if I'm in the wrong place here or what.

**edit#2** decided to check back and see how many negative votes i had and it turns out i'm #1 with over 100 comments. better get to answering some questions! please be patient with me as I get through to everyone

**edit#3** i think i've just about answered everyone who wasn't flat out insulting or trolling.  the one questions I couldn't answer was *How Thick?* so I will see if he lets me measure it tonight for the internet strangers.  if not I will pay very close attention to exactly how it is in my hands and then later try and find a household object that relates as closely as possible.

**edit#4** alright and i'm signing off for the night. kids have been fed, cleaned, clothed, and put to bed.  this means that its sexy times!  i'll check back in tomorrow to see if there's any new questions. "	t5_2sxwp	True
1376098480.0	1k2cir	I'm currently at a wedding that turned into a divorce party	ZenSilby	611	117	107	"I've been in the wedding field for over 8 years and this is a first for me. The wedding is now a divorce party for the groom's side of the family. More people are showing up every minute.

EDIT 1... Well this took off more than I thought it would. I am going off the grid, SO wants private time. I'll update in the morning when I get to my office, I'm sure there will be a nice long list of notes and updates from my staff!

EDIT 2... Wow, this reaaaally took off. I just woke up and will be at work in less than a few hours. I will provide a clear update based on the notes left for me! All I know is that the party did not get project x status because I didn't get any calls from frightened staff in the middle of the night (which I have before lol). There is no safe involved, I will deliver the update.

**FINAL STORY**

Potential Bride and Groom come in wanting a ceremony and reception. They already are married and are interesting in more of a renewal of vows because they never had a ceremony, just a paper signing downtown. Though we didn't find this out until the second details meeting. The sister of bride is the one that shows up to the details meeting (which we have at 90, 30, at 10 days out) except the final one, where the bride and groom show up to pay the remaining balance which was still owed. They dropped a large sum of money on Friday to keep the wedding a reality because they still had an open balance. Our rule is all events have to be paid in full on the day of your last details meeting or it's cancelled.  

Monday comes around and we get a call from Groom in hysterics saying his buddies wife died overseas (military related) and he is flying out for the funeral and needs to cancel the wedding. Mind you, they just dropped thousands to keep it alive a few days prior and they don't get that back. After speaking to a few military friends of mine today they said it's extremely rare to have a funeral overseas (especially Afghanistan, where we were told this happened) and nothing happens that quickly because it takes a few days and apparently sometimes weeks for bodies to be transported back to the US. We didn't know any of that then, so it was more of a OMG we are so sorry and tried to see if he wanted to postpone it but he said no.  

We get a call Thursday from bride &amp; groom, BOTH happy and on the phone. He explained it's back on and that he isn't flying out anymore and the funeral has been moved here at a later time.  Being the awesome bunch of bastards we are, we oblige the 24hr wedding request and my badass staff and vendors make it happen (we had already prepared the room for a completely different event, nor had we ordered the food, linen, etc... for this one). 

Event day comes and the start time is 5pm for the cocktail hour and grand entrance for B&amp;G is 6.  The formal room and sculptured garden sits like a ghost town short of my penguin dressed staff, bartender, DJ, and lonely display of appetizers. Around 545 groom shows up in the most awkward starts to an event I've ever seen. It was like one of those scenes from an ol timey saloon when the bad guy walks in and the music stops while everyone looks around dumbfoundedly. Groom had bust in with about 15 cronies rocking casual wear in the midst of a formal setting carrying a case of beer (even though they had paid for an open bar) stating directly to my waitstaff ""You guys get on your phones and text people, tell them to come to the party"". After about 15 seconds of awkwardness everyone went in motion with music and hand passed appetizers. My staff was confused beyond words. 

When we asked him when bride would be arriving both he and some others looked at us like we said the devils name and shot us some looks. I then peeked at his hand and he was definitely not wearing his wedding ring. Although he tried to reach Project X levels of party hardness, the event maxed out with around 100 people showing up on and off by the end of the night. The groom and original cronies were wild'n out all night. They set up beer pong tables, quarters games, apparently even footraces took place.  I let my staff relax a bit and have fun (to an extent) with the groom and the guests. Once I saw the ridiculousness of penguins hand serving appetizers to drunk people in shorts I toned down the formality regulations for the evening. My staff even made solo cup runs for the groom and partook in beer pong (my staff had to use water cups)

Unfortunately we did NOT find out any specific details of *why* the marriage ended or if in fact there was any friend at all.  All we still know to this point is that something awful happened within 24 hours to shut a marriage down. Groom made the most of it though, so good for him.  Sometimes you have to look at the positives when paying for an expensive beer pong divorce party. We may receive a few updates during the week, but our industry moves fast, shit... we have 2 weddings today and a memorial tomorrow followed by 2 luncheons on Monday. Life moves forward. We as a staff decided to believe that the friend was actually the secret lover of the groom and that's why he absolutely needed to go out to see him. Bride got suspicious so groom said it can wait and everything went back on. Right before the event the groom confessed, as the groom said fuck it... let's have a party. 

The biggest monkey wrench of this whole situation is the invitations. We don't now why they were never sent, those go out way in advance and we checked our system and they were shipped to the b&amp;g months ago. The invitations are like when Michael Jackson looked at you at the end of thriller... you think you finally are safe and have it all figured out and then BAM, invitation eyes.

1362602096.0	19sovu	I've been a Dealer/Pit Boss/Surveillance Agent in Vegas for the past decade, AMA.	Hopfrogg	544	83	343	"This started with a comment I made on the [whose the biggest asshole famous person you’ve ever met](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/19rq7a/whose_the_biggest_asshole_famous_person_youve/) that was on the front page. People wanted to hear more, so doing a casual AMA. My original comment is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/19rq7a/whose_the_biggest_asshole_famous_person_youve/c8qt4sj?context=3) (basically J Lo is cool, the Bulls are dicks, Phelps is a douche, Woods was a disaster waiting to happen, and Affleck is a Vegas legend). Will share some more stories and answer any questions, will answer general casino questions too.

A lot of people wanted to hear more about Jamie Foxx and DiCaprio. One of the richest guys in the world is a Malaysian who is an absolute batshit crazy party animal and a huge gambler. The casino I worked at actually flew in the Pussycat Dolls for one of his wild birthday parties and of course outfits him with private gaming rooms complete with bottles of Johnny Walker Blue that they go through like water. Well I start my shift and whoa, this dude is hanging with Jamie Foxx and Leo DiCaprio (this was a few years before Django)… and throwing them $25,000 chips like they were pieces of candy. Ah, so now I see why they are “friends” with this guy.
 
You also got to imagine the scene, there are hookers everywhere and plenty of this guy’s drunk Asian friends getting smashed all around them. Both Foxx and Leo actually seemed like the most sensible ones in the room. Leo especially was low key. We estimated the Malaysian threw a few hundred grand their way and probably just so he could have some celebrity friends at his party. It was still odd to see one of the biggest money makers in Hollywood hanging with this guy just cause he was throwing money his way, but hey free money just to sit near this guy, why not? I don’t have dirt on either of those two though, sorry, they were the only ones not going back and forth to the rooms with the hookers, but Foxx made a really cool move.

The next morning Foxx comes pulling up in a beautiful brand new decked out orange Camaro. My buddy that I worked with, well this is his dream car, he was drooling over this thing. Jamie hands the Malaysian the keys… Happy Birthday… but get this.. after Jamie leaves, the guy starts bitching that it isn’t a BMW, my buddy wanted to fucking strangle the guy.

Junior Seau is probably the guy that sticks out the most, mainly because of how it all ended and because of what happened one weekend. Man, this was such a nice fucking guy it is a shame how he ended it. This was one of our biggest players, probably the biggest player as an athlete. I’ll remember one weekend in particular… this guy was losing his ass, most I have ever seen him lose in one weekend. Nothing is going right for him and we see his girl (not sure who she was maybe ex-wife?? Short hot blonde) giving him hell all through the casino. 

I was on what we call a floor walk (I was in the eye at this time) which is basically just walking the casino incognito looking for cheats etc… mainly just an excuse to get out of the room, and as I am walking I see Junior and his girl walking toward me down the hall and she is giving him hell…. A fan walks by and yells “Hey Tiaina!”, which was his real name so he clearly was a true fan… so in the middle of what appears to be a nightmare of a weekend, losing his ass, getting berated by his girl… he fucking takes the time, stops, puts on a huge smile and is all “Hey Buddy! How’s it going”… I know that seems like a little thing, but knowing what he was going through at the time, it said a lot.

Well Junior went on to lose his ass all that weekend, and even so, man he was still just so nice to everyone during all of it. A few days later he drove his car over a cliff. I said to everyone in the room, I think that might have been a suicide attempt. Of course everyone was like no fucking way, that guy was all-pro for so many years, he always seems happy and is smiling, he has a big restaurant, etc… it must have just been an accident. Of course now hindsight is 20/20... but it is very easy to see how no one could see it coming, dude always seemed happy and was nice to everyone. I’m not saying I think his reasons were financial or because of gambling, but I think it was a factor.

Just some more quick tidbits or I will be here all day and sorry if this isn’t as interesting as was expected, but just going to give the straight scoop even if it isn’t all that exciting.

Stallone… one of the shyest celebs I think I have ever seen. I’m not sure what the whole arrangement is with him, Willis, and Schwarzenegger and the Planet Hollywood deal, but I used to see both Stallone and Willis in there a lot… never saw Arnold. Stallone would always go straight to the back of the sports book with the current owner and seemed to want to stay as incognito as much as possible, seemed polite enough, but never wanted to talk with anybody and I got the feeling it was more out of timidity than being a jerk… odd to see such a big personality seem so shy. 

Willis on the other hand, that guy loved to roll the dice and chat it up… especially if you were a female in your twenties. Funniest thing I saw was when he was on a terrible losing streak and instead of losing it in front of everyone, he walks around the corner and yells and kicks a cement pole so hard we though he broke his foot.

Holy crap, Pam and Tommy Lee. She had a show at Planet Hollywood for a while and he was her guest one night. They are walking back to her room with one security guard escorting in the front and one in the back… picture them all lined up like a train… and Tommy Lee pulls down his pants and starts humping her as they walk down a hallway… lol, actually he was just goofing around for the security guards and not actually doing her, but it was still funny as shit to see.

They filmed a lot of movies at Planet Hollywood including “21”. Ashton and Cameron used to play blackjack at the live games in between takes, really small stakes like $25 a hang, but Demi was always in the background somewhere, lol, it was like mama bear always had to keep an eye on her cub. Ashton seemed like a nice dude, seemed kinda nerdy. Amazing how different real personas are, Cameron seemed more like a soccer mom in real life than the wild chick she is in the movies.

Billy Gibbons from ZZ Top is cool as shit to everyone, at least in Vegas. Was shocked to read a story on the net about him being a dick to a fan, cause he always went of his way to sign stuff for people and hang out at the low limit tables and talk with folks like a regular dude.

Clarence Beeks from Trading Places, probably before a lot of people’s times and just throwing this in as a personal thing. As a child from the 80’s and a huge fan of that flick, nothing like being a craps dealer and looking up to see Clarence Beeks yell 26 across. I laughed inside but pretended not to know who he was, no one really noticed him. Nice enough guy, nothing special good or bad.

Again, sorry if this turned out to be kinda boring, but will answer any questions you have. There are of course a ton of things I am forgetting or didn’t bother to mention. Will add more stuff as I recollect it.

1360773466.0	18g9zk	"I was a ""Fem Starlet"" (translation: child porn model) for almost five years and know first hand that CP is not a victimless crime. AM(almost)A"	wavingEmotions	519	92	308	"I decided to post this with a fake account because not everyone in my life knows about my past and so I'd rather keep it that way. 

Between 2000 and 2004 I was a ""Fem Starlet"". Most of those types of sites don't exist anymore but there was a time when there were many, many such ""child model"" sites. For those of you who may remember I'll give you a hint about the one I was a part of: it was basically a network of websites that featured us ""child models"", each having our own domain like ""Linda.fem-starlets.net"" where ""Linda"" was the name of the particular model. You had to pay something like $30/month to access the network. Owners of the individual pages received a monthly check depending on how much traffic it drove to the network.

Nothing nude or pornographic was allowed on the site but the more risque and suggestive the clothing/outfits, the better-- after all, it was all about generating traffic. The more hits you got the bigger the check.

The head of the network eventually fled his home country after unsuccessfully fighting the government's attempt to shut down his (MANY) sites in court. As far as I know he's still at large. No, he was not an American but I won't say where he was from. Those of you who know, know.

Keep in mind that I never met that jerk or interacted with him in any way. My step-dad was simply one of hundreds (thousands?) of people who set up his own account there-- starring me as his ""model"". I was nine when we started and 14 when he left.

For those of you inclined to defend ""child modeling"" like this as an art form that should be protected as free speech, here's what I really want you to take away from reading this: the ""modeling"" part was all bullshit. It was just a way to incite pedos to solicit my step-dad for more hard-core types of pictures and videos of me. From day one my step-dad made it clear that we had to be careful with what we posted on the site but at the same time be suggestive enough to garner the interest of pedos who were willing to pay for the illegal stuff.

That's why I get so frustrated when people joke about child pornography or make excuses for pedophiles who seek out CP. If there wasn't a market for such things nobody would create it. But there is a market, a huge market, and thousands of children are exploited every year to meet that market's demands. I was one of them.

Okay I'll just leave it at that for now and wait to see if anyone has questions. 

**EDIT 10:15pm CT** Sorry I had to leave for a bit, I'll try to answer everyone I missed now!

**EDIT 5:27 PM ET**  I'll  be back later, right now I've got to go play with my real-life kids and have dinner.  Thanks for all the questions so far!

**EDIT 10:24 PM ET** That's it for tonight.  I must say, this turned a lot more serious than I was expecting.  I hope all of you with serious issues and questions find a way to get them resolved with your real-life parents.  I hope my advice is helpful, but I am not a professional counselor or anything like that; I'm just a guy.  Thanks again for all the comments and votes (still not sure how that works, exactly).  Good night for now.  Hopefully I can be back tomorrow.

**Saturday morning** Wow.  I'm pretty overwhelmed with what's happened here.  A lot of you are going through some very tough situations that, honestly, I don't feel very well-equipped to handle.  I'll keep this up as much as I can and try to help where I can.  Please remember, I am not a professional counselor or therapist, and any advice I may offer is just my opinion.  

There's a post farther down that asks a bunch of questions about me and my personal parenting style and family situation.  I won't be answering all of those, but here's a little more about me:

* My wife and I are in our mid-30's and have two kids;
* I work full-time, she works part-time, we manage;
* We're Christians, and try to live as true followers of Christ (I realize that on reddit this could be a real turn-off, but hopefully I've shown myself so far to be caring and somewhat tolerant.)  
* Further to the above, in addition to what advice I may post, I also offer prayer, whether you like it or not.

**EDIT 7/7 9:13 PM ET**  Everyone, thanks for all the comments, this has really gone much farther than I thought it would.  Unfortunately, I won't be able to personally respond to all of you, I just don't have the time.  I will just offer a few bits of advice that I've seen a few questions about:

* If you're in an abusive situation, LEAVE.  Call the police, call your local child protective services agency, find a shelter, but get out of that situation.

* If you and your dad haven't communicated in a long time, or just don't say ""I love you,"" then you may have to be the one to make the first move.  Take whatever you're thinking about writing here and write it to your dad.  I know the parent is supposed to be the mature one in your relationship, but sometimes that isn't the case.  Just talk to your dad.  You may have to try more than once.  Don't give up.

I'll still try to check in on this if it keeps going, but I do have my own family obligations to attend to.  Otherwise, there is the /r/askdad subreddit where more people answer questions.

Thanks again, everyone.  I'll keep praying for you, too.

Feel free to AMA about what I went through, how I coped with everything, etc. I may be reluctant to go into details about the sexual abuse, but I will try my best. 

Edit: Just wanted to add a little about the nature of the violence. It was very little hitting, and more often creative. He would make us stand in one spot with our arms out in a T shape and we would have to hold out stacks of books for hours (I still have a bad back from this). We would also regularly be held up at gunpoint. At one point my sister pushed the barrel away and it went off right beside her head (we were punished because he almost shot her). When he would get drunk or high, by the end of the night we would have to hold him down to stop him from hurting us, although it usually left its own amount of bruises.

1367667002.0	1do9qj	I'm About To Lose Everything I've Worked Half My Adult Life For. AMA	deathbydanny	303	51	154	"I will give a full, fleshed out story if I'm asked about it, but here's the short version-

Due to what I call extreme bad luck, I have been without a job for over a year. I've been supplementing my income in various ways- none of them illegal- for the past year to keep from losing it all before now, but unfortunately the well has dried up. It's almost an inevitability that I'm about to lose my house. I'm still in it on borrowed time, fundamentally.

Why an AMA?

-the random chance that some stranger out there has some sort of magical answer that'll solve my problems without being forced into prostitution

-I've lived an extremely interesting life (survived traumatic childhood up to and including having a loaded shotgun held in my face by my mother, had extremely odd situations with friends around, tried and somewhat succeeded to make a living with the arts in various categories- music, painting, drawing, etc). Moreover, I love to talk and tell stories. I won't hide the fact (anymore) that I'm in a really bad spot in life right now due to extreme bad luck, but this serves the purpose of helping me forget my troubles for a little bit. At the very least, I'll have entertained myself enough to smile a bit, and you enough to make this thread worth it.

-Reddit is a big place. There's probably someone going through something similar who'll help put The Big Picture in perspective for me- a Bad Luck Network of sorts-, offer advice, share tips to get out of this hole I've fallen into, or at the very least, share interesting stories with me and by proxy, all of us. It won't make my problems magically go away, but at least it'll distract me from reality long enough to get into a good mood...maybe.

**EDIT** I'm about to head out for now. Despite all the BS I'm going through, it *is* my birthday weekend, so hopefully, I can have some fun tonight. I don't plan on abandoning this AMA though, so by all means, keep asking away, and I'll answer them when I get a chance. Also posted a link to some of my art-related stuff for the curious.

**EDIT 2** I plan on leaving this AMA perpetually open (even if I do one on IAmA, and just link to it) because I've gotten a surprising amount of support/kindness, and I don't want to leave anyone hanging. Today, though (5/5/13) I might not be answering too much- friend who's wifi we were using is in and out today, and to be honest, I got very drunk last night (it WAS my birthday...), so I'm very hungover. I spent a great deal of time hugging the toilet since 2am...eesh.) 

A few of the kinder amongst you have asked about making donations, which I appreciate, but I don't have a Paypal completely set up yet, and I won't be able to properly do it today as my internet, yeah, being weird, on top of being sick, but if I do set it up, I'll edit it into here. But I don't want to be that jerk that everyone thinks is just soliticing money on Reddit, so I'll submit some proof to the mods before I post a Paypal link. And I've encountered a new problem- because my bank account is now closed, I can't really open a new one, meaning I can't verify it without that or my (now useless) debit card. Is there a way around this?

**EDIT 3** Spotty internet, yikes! Just letting you guys know I'm still around. Thankfully, I still have electricity today. Today is my actual birthday (having celebrated last weekend) and today's supposed to be packed. So again, if you guys have questions, go ahead and post them. I'll answer them when I see them.

**EDIT 4** Still spotty internet, and just got the notice- electricity off in five business days. Not too many new questions, but yes, an update. Hopefully I can pull something off; I'm gonna be talking to the power company to negotiate in the next couple of days.

**EDIT 5- 5/14/13** Lost the internet. Now posting from public library. I'm still here, but there's no new questions. If anyone pops up, I'll be here answering it. Since I'm without internet, I have to post proof the hard way (get home, take pics of my mortgage, upload them from public computer) but I plan on doing so ASAP, because it's crunch time, and I need all the help I can get.

-He was so overweight that if we went to an amusement park, he literally could not fit on the rides.  [These](http://www.destinationorlando.com/universal_orlando/the-incredible-hulk.jpg) kind of chairs would not close over him.  
-He tried to use my Wii Fit once and was too heavy for it.  The weight limit is 330lbs.

Proof: Due to the nature of the way I lived, I didn't exactly take photographic evidence of my transactions, but I do feel that seeing a picture of me then and now should at least be a fairly dramatic example of my change of lifestyle.

Parents divorced age 2.  Mother kidnapped me during weekend visitation and took off to French Quarter, where we lived on the streets for the next year, crashing on couches of friends whenever possible.

Kidnapped at gunpoint by father age 3, then placed in a convent/orphanage until age 7.  (The place still exists, is now a sort of ""girls finishing school"" but that is not what it was historically - I was one of the last students admitted while it was still a residential facility - St. Joseph's Academy in Baton Rouge)

Mother married a small-time Florida politician who turned to drug dealing to afford the custody battle to get me out of the convent school.  

Small-time drug dealer with tons of charisma, a decent brain and a strong work ethic?  Easily became a very successful drug dealer, eventually playing the Cuban and Italian mafias against each other.

We lived next door to a DEA agent in New Orleans.  My school principal lived across the street.  During this time period one of my chores was spraying (mixture of water and red wine, usually) and turning the pot in a child's plastic swimming pool kept in the study.  

Eventually he got into cocaine as well as pot and then started using product, which is when things got pretty dark and violent and bad.  Mom and I escaped from him when I was 10 but he continued to stalk us across the country for several years (at least until I was 16) until eventually he died.

I will be moving to China soon to be an English teacher. While I'm there I hope to meet an older Chinese lady who has a lot of money. Now you might be thinking: why go to China to meet a rich woman? Several reasons:

* China has [1,020,000 people with $1.6 million US dollars](http://business.financialpost.com/2012/08/01/meet-the-average-chinese-millionaire-39-plays-golf-and-owns-an-ipad/) or more, and 63,500 people with $16 million or more.
* 40% of Chinese millionaires are female, slightly higher then the percentage of American millionaires that are female.
* Chinese female millionaires are more likely to be self-made millionaires, whereas American female millionaires are more likely to have inherited the money from a father or husband. I am much more attracted to women that make their own money than women that get money from someone else.
* Chinese millionaires are an average of 39 years old, whereas American millionaires are 57. So the age gap will be less of an issue if I marry a rich Chinese woman.
* China does not value career women. Google ""leftover women"". Most men do not want to date a woman over 27, and they don't want to date a woman who makes more than they do. So there is less competition for me.
* White men generally get a lot of interest from women in China.

I can't imagine what you'd be curious about, but...ask me anything.

EDIT 2: [Audio.](http://k004.kiwi6.com/hotlink/4mqxexs0qm/toothbrush.mp3) There's one good wail in the beginning, but I wasn't able to salvage a lot of the audio because my roommate had the dryer running to make it harder to hear him. I guess that's the one smart thing he did today. Near the end is dialogue between my roommate, his girlfriend and the surgeon. 

In addition to NOT getting the toothbrush out, the doctor apparently ruptured his colon, or at least caused some kind of damage to it. Because of this, my roommate is going to the ER at 8:30AM tomorrow for free surgery. Apparently fucking a nurse can be a better deal than health insurance.

He killed himself over the embarrassment the media circus caused my family over his actions when I was 12. (I'm 35 now.) So, he was never convicted. He admitted guilt to me, drunk, over the phone, a day before he hung himself.

No, he never messed with me, or any of my brothers or sister.

When I was 8, I had to go live with my grandmother for several months, and never understood why. We had to move several times. I broke off friendships with people because they found out and accused him of it to me, and (since I, or my family never watched the news) never knew that they were right at the time.

He worked his ass off, holding 2 different industrial jobs. He loved to play guitar, and had a band going. He fostered a passion of science in me that thrives to this day. I thought the world of him. He never, ever left me or my siblings with a single shred of doubt that we were loved.

But I still can't help but wonder...if it weren't for the media's coverage and family embarrassment, he might be still alive today and behind bars.

In no way shape or form was my dad proud of what he did. He knew what he did was wrong, but when you are on drugs and such, you forget your morals.

He tried to live a good life after he did what he did, and tried to make up for it.

Trying to explain how he died is so much more complicating than a car accident or some sort of sickness like cancer. I'm hoping this AmA will be a good way to reference those around me. 

Here's a brief overview of that day: It was around 5am in 2009 that my dad had come home from work to find the bathroom door locked and the venting fan on. After getting no response from knocking on the door, my dad opted to break into the bathroom. My dad said he found my brother in his underwear with a belt wrapped around his neck attached to the closet door. He knew my brother had already been dead due to the fact rigamortis (stiffing of a dead body) had already set in. My dad first called the police, knelt down and whisered ""goodbye"" to him and then rushed to wake my mother and then me to tell us ""Jared died"" I remember throwing up immediately because the idea made me absolutely sick and horrified. My mother was hysterical. Mainly because she was in the room next to the bathroom and felt she should have had some sort of motherly instinct to wake up and save him. 
The police and coroner came to assess the scene. From the markings on his neck from the belt he was able to tell us that my brother passed out from choking and the belt slipped up suffocating him to death. Because he passed out he was unable to move back up and this killed him. 
We found out a few hours later from his best friend he had talked about trying this out because it was something he heard others do before. The irony of this is the fact he had another friend whose brother had died doing the exactly thing, therefore he knew the risks of doing this. 

Ultimately the thing that makes this whole type of death hard to explain is not making it come off as bad. My brother died masturbating while choking himself and there's no way of making that statement sound decent. I've spent the last 4 years telling people he accidentally  was strangled to death in our home, but that's it. I leave out the true nature of what transpired. 

Note: I am super new to this Reddit account and doing this. If anyone can help me figure out how to post pictures of us that would be great. Thanks.

Sometime in the future we will chase it all down I'm sure. It is difficult to talk about this stuff and some people calling us liars flat out was upsetting, though we tried to tell ourselves it was to be expected.

1365998878.0	1cdbjt	I am the pizza dough that was taken advantage of a few days back. AMA.	androomoo	228	85	46	"This is my story:

He did it. 

It started off as any normal day would have for a dough like me. A proud working Mexican fella gathered all the ingredients he found necessary to make a batch of the foundation for a soon to be freshly-cooked pizza. This however, was no ordinary day. I came out looking hott. Glistening from the glow under well-lit kitchen ceiling lights. Feeling confident in the chef's creation, I was put near the front of the tray. A trophy of the cooks prized recipe to be admired for all to see. However, my stunning appearance and front row seat to the glitz and glamour of a pizza dough model were unknowingly to be my downfall. It was around the time I was placed near the aisle way of the freezer when I saw him. A current employee of the restaurant, ImKenndy. Generally, this guy hadn't raised any concern. Sure he was an oddball, but no one ever could have guessed what psychotic actions he was capable of. He gracefully said hello to the chef as the freezer door was slowly closed shut, but not before ImKenndy threw me the look. It was a look of lust, desire, and a particular determination to fulfil a long sought-after urge. The way his eyes pierced through my doughy physique made my yeast start to rise. This was going to be bad. After a minute or two of anticipation and silence, the freezer door creaked open. It was him. Soon after secluding himself with me in the freezer he whiped out some plastic and I was stuffed in it. I tried to scream for help but it was too late. I was sealed-up in a zip lock bag with what appeared to be a rubber candy wrapper. Seconds turned into minutes, minutes into longer minutes as I awaited my fate. Next thing I know I was in the washroom, violently being ripped from the bag and roughly kneaded and caressed up and down. He brought me close up to his face. Hot garlic breath intrusively flowed over me as his pants were drawn down with me following shortly after. I cried for help but all that was heard was the water from the sink roaring over me. I was drowned out with the one thing to keep the employees clean...this day however, it was of no use. He wiped the sweat off his forehead as he finished with me only to stuff me back in the bag. The nightmare wasn't over yet. There was a knock on the door. A manager! I gathered the strength I had left to scream one last time but it was of no use. I am just a simple flour-based product that the underdeveloped auscultating system of the human ear can not comprehend. I was doomed from the start. The day progressed as I laid in his filth, soaking in what I thought was to be the misery and regret of his actions. This was proven wrong as the day became night and what seemed like eternity became much worse. After being rushed home, I was pulled out from the zip lock bag. My horror pulled into overdrive as I was thrown onto the bed. In a struggle to break free I bounced up upon impact only to be redirected to the top of his pillow. His eyes glazed over with desperation as he pounced up on top of me. I was violently pressed up and down against him as he fulfilled his urge one last time...I was then tossed into the trash like a piece of meat never to be seen again. My nightmare was over, and I could finally rest in peace..."	t5_2sxwp	True
1345128675.0	yblzy	I spent 8 years with a partner who suffered from Disassociative Identity Disorder (multiple personalities).  Some details in comments.  AMA.	DID_AMA	155	15	200	"Here are the basics:

* Disassociative Identity Disorder means that the person ""blanks out"" for a while, and a completely new personality takes over.  It might be a child, it might be another adult, it might have a completely different accent.  Most ""entities"" have a completely unique identity, and you can talk to them and hold conversations.  The person doesn't remember what happens while they're blacked out, all they know is that time seems to have skipped forward and they might be in a different place than they were a moment ago.
* We started dating when I was in college, getting my undergraduate degree in Psychology.  Yes, you could say I was fascinated ;)
* At the peak, she had eight separate entities that could be called at will, and one who manifested on her own.
* We spent years researching causes of the disorder and treatment, and when our relationship ended, we had managed to merge all but two of the entities.
* While I won't reveal personal or identifying information, there were lots of fascinating incidents and stories.  Some of the entities could do things that she couldn't (like read without her glasses).  I never figured out how that worked.

I'm going to call my girlfriend Jane.  Rather... I'm going to call her ""real"" personality Jane.  I need a way to distinguish.

Curious about multiple personalities, how they work, and how it's treated?  Ask away.  Please note though, I will not be discussing the actual trauma that caused Jane's personalities to manifest.  That's something personal that isn't really my business to go posting on the internet.

Edit:  9:00am EDT.  Back to answer more questions for the day.  I'm really glad everyone is enjoying the thread, I've been wanting to post it for a while but wasn't sure there'd be interest."	t5_2sxwp	True

1347387157.0	zpxoc	Exmormon deconverted by Reddit, AMA	Mithryn	180	42	274	"For my 5 year cake day: I am an exmormon, who knows lots about the mormon church history, backgrounds, conspiracies, current workings. AMA

Some background: I was raised by an amateur apologist, was baptized at 8, served a mission in Scandinavia, graduated from BYU, Married in the Temple, served as Elder's Quorum president twice (Local leadership).

**Why I left**

There is a lot to it, no single event, but basically I decided to prove the church was true, and quell some of the niggling details that bothered me. 3 1/2 years of research later, the percentage chance that the church was true was so low, I had to reject it. Reddit was significantly helpful in my understanding of truth and working through logical quandaries.

**Mitt Romney**

 I am a republican, but I do not support Romney.
I will answer questions about things he ducks/avoids and why he does it from a member perspective.

**But you left the church, doesn't that make you unreliable?!**

This is likely to be the most commonly said thing by active members of the church at me, so I thought to address it upfront. The idea that a person's 33 years of experience and deep research into a social organization lose all credibility the moment they leave that social organization is a fallacy. William Law, Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer and others do not suddenly become liars and false witnesses simply because they left.

Instead of accusing me of being biased, wrong and evil, ask some questions and get a feel for my bias, my preferences, and my intent yourself.

With that, anything you haven't learned about mormons from previous AMA's, feel free to ask. Sources will be provided for any rumors that you have heard and would like verified (If the rumors are true)

1376048755.0	1k0qnv	IAmA - A person who lives day to day with Amnesia.	Zoss0	171	40	255	"Hi all,
I'm not sure how to start off as I don't have much/don't know what to type up. I'm currently a 20yr old student trying to get though Uni. I do not expect to pass.

I basically live in the present with almost no knowledge of who I am/what I am. I write what has happened to me in the past in my notebook (Basically it's become me.) My earliest memory is vague and is probably ever changing and I have no idea if it even happened, I may have made it up to comfort myself on a sub-conscious level.

To me, I seemly have been ignored by the medical profession because of my young age and fit condition and has furthered my 'natural' depression that I don't want to ever try to get this confirmed as well as my other problems that scares the absolute shit out of me. (Heart pain, extreme low blood pressure/HR to the point I can pass out when standing up or even shift position.)

The way I currently try to remember things is to think from an anchor point or follow logic/think logically.

I don't have many friends as people get insulted when I forget things about them, say the wrong things I guess. My family do not seem to understand how debilitating it is. (however, they have put up with me to this day so they can't be that bad.) I guess it's really hard for them to see things from my eyes since memory is so natural for everyone.

Recently that point has been strengthened as I reconnected with an old friend from HS, according to him it's tragic.

The reason I am posting this to casualiama is I have limited proof of my condition (only referral letters from GP to hospitals which have been ignored.) and I simply have lost all hope to get this fixed.

TL;DR - Student who has Amnesia currently attempting to study and lives with basically no support except some family with no future.

Edit - for you med people and /some/ proof - http://i.imgur.com/Xve1vHl.jpg

Despite being a juvenile, the record cannot be sealed due to the nature of the offense. I was sentenced to 52 - 65 weeks, and served the maximum, despite excellent behavior. (I was raised southern baptist, I've never been anything but courteious.). My extended stay was just due to the fact that the state couldn't figure out where to put me. 

I then spent 2 years on parole and in a sexually aggressive therapeutic group home, and then went on to live in foster care. I have graduated SAY (sexually aggressive youth) therapy 3 times, while using the police report as my guide, as I have no memory of the event.

My (adoptive) mother, the one who called the police, has a history of mental illness due to head trauma and drug use, but this was not brought up in the courtroom (from what I remember), and the trial was rushed, and I was told to plead guilty. I have a long history of repressed memories, and I am told there was evidence, so I am assuming I committed the crime. My alleged victim was my then 2 year old (adoptive) sister. 

My (biological) mother has her doubts though. She has no history of mental illness, and has since been employed with the Department of Corrections, and at a Law Firm. 

Due to my age when I entered therapy, and the nature of some of the therapy, I developed a social phobia, and have trouble interacting with people in person, and have full blown anxiety and panic attacks if there is a child in the room. In addition to my social phobia, I also suffer from sever clinical depression and ADHD. Besides my biological mother, I have not seen any of my family since 2002.

My folks adopted him when he was six or seven. (I'm one year older.) As kids, we were expected to dress ourselves and make our beds in the morning before school. My brother -- we'll call him Roy -- would get up in the middle of the night, put on all his clothes, make his bed, and sleep on the covers. So he wouldn't have to do it in the morning.

Roy used to steal $20 bills from my mom's purse, go to the corner store, buy a huge bag of candy, and eat it all. At once.

He used to steal lunch meat from the fridge and keep it under his pillow. For days. (We always wondered why his room smelled bad.)

I know all these stories just make him sound strange, not necessarily dangerous. But here's one:

One of his favorite games was to take a sharp or heavy object (knife, throwing star, brick, whatever) and ""pretend"" to throw it at someone. But he would also ""pretend"" it slipped out of his hand and actually throw it at the person.

But that's not the most fucked up part: After he'd do this, he'd say, ""I'm sorry,"" because he knew that's what he was supposed to say.

1329524683.0	pumfq	I am the only child of a Compulsive Hoarder. Photos included in the post. Ask Me Anything.	Child_of_Hoarder	149	19	55	"I would like to begin this AMA by saying that I made a new account to keep this separate from my real identity. I am not doing this to brag or to show off, but rather to make a plea to others to notice such problems with members of their families and friends and find them help before it's too late. Despite me understanding that this is a serious mental illness, it's still a source of great shame in my life, as it is for most children of hoarders.

Without further delay, [here are the photos.](http://imgur.com/a/V2uar#0) Yes, the trash really is as high as the counters. Yes, we slept in there, somewhere. Yes, the bunkbed is covered too. We moved around in the house by stepping on the trash and furniture.

I realize that some of them are quite unbelievable, even to me now, but they're quite real. This is where I grew up, and I can't believe I thought this was normal for a large portion of my childhood.

**How did it start?**

It starts soon after my mother moves into a new home. At first, you think it will be different this time, but you always have a nagging feeling in the back of your mind that it will happen again. Then you begin to notice a bit of clutter, some trash not thrown away fast enough, a new habit of collecting dishes or, for my mother, yarn. Before long, it becomes too bothersome to try to manage, and even taking out the trash seems to make no difference. Eventually houses become uninhabitable. Long after they're unsafe to live in, my mother then moves into a new house *somehow*. My father, who never married my mother because of her hoarding, confirms that she's been doing this since before I was born. My uncle, who has known my mother her entire life, confirms that she was doing it before that.

**Is this the worst of it?**

No. At times, my mother would hoard animals, either for companionship or as a scheme to breed them and ""make money."" At one point, she had almost a hundred birds when I was a baby, causing me numerous health problems. At another, I remember us having more than fourteen dogs. The local animal shelter has taken a number in the past due to neglect. She seems incapable of understanding the responsibilities of a pet owner. This particular house shown in the pictures at one point had dog fecal matter everywhere in the kitchen, a dead ferret in that cage you can see in one photo, and dead dogs littering the backyard.

**Why didn't you run? Tell the police?**

Children of hoarders rarely have the insight to get help when they're young. They either, like me, think that it's normal behavior for parents, or they are afraid of being separated from their family by child services. Due to the fear of the second, my mother did not allow me to have friends over (for obvious reasons), and only allowed me to go over to friends' homes when I was older and already realized that her behavior was not normal.

**What does she say about it?**

She does not acknowledge that she has a problem. When confronted, even indirectly, she becomes extremely hostile, threatening to kick me out of the house when I'm home visiting (she lives in a new home now where the cycle is already beginning again). To excuse her ""slight clutter,"" she makes excuses like, ""Oh, I was just depressed *then*."" Another usual phrase is, ""I'm just in a funk right now."" Another, ""I've just been really busy recently. I'll clean everything up soon.""

She does not listen if I try to help her stop buying more things, such as even more plates and other decorative items, even if the house already has more than enough.

**How does this happen? Why doesn't she just stop?**

It's a mental illness. It's not just being a messy person. However, there are some legitimate things that contribute to the hoarding. One is that, as the house becomes messier, one cannot *find* things that you need, so you go out and buy another. This means that eventually you have 10 items littering the home rather than one. Also, sales are a terrible thing. In order to save money, my mother has bought many things she'll ""maybe need later,"" or ""can never have enough of"" even if she has no room for such items. As you can see in the photos, she hoards yarn. She buys more and more, claiming it was on sale and she'll make ""profits."" The facts are that she's spent thousands of dollars on yarn she's never used.

**Have you experienced any problems as a result of this?**

I have had extensive therapy after leaving home to deal with my issues. I have problems with being ""too clean,"" and I hate owning ""things."" I try to only own a desktop, plus what can fit in my backpack and traveling duffel bag. I own very few things, and save my money instead due to only buying what is necessary. I'm working on that, but honestly I enjoy minimal living. I grew up poor, as you can probably tell from the photos, so I'm used to making ends meet.

When I lived with her, after the kitchen became unusable, we survived by eating microwavable canned food such as beefaroni, and junk food. My primary drink was gatorade, while chips and pizza made up my diet most days. I was never fat, but I had numerous malnutrition problems. I'm much healthier now that I'm in control of my diet.

Relations with my mother are, of course, strained. I worry for her health, and I worry, selfishly, about what I'll do when I have to ""clean up"" after her eventual death. In order to live a healthier life away from the mess, I rarely come home to visit. Perhaps once every 3 years.

I can't think of any other really obvious things, so please feel free to ask me what you want. The only thing I ask in return is that you try to get help for anyone you know who may be experiencing something similar. If you're a teacher, please take your children's hints at their home lives seriously. I tried several times to get help from my teachers, but they thought I was lying. Anyway, AMA.

**(edit) Thank you everyone for the interest. The mods erased my thread because they said it described a mental disorder. I reposted it to http://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/ I'm still answering questions in this thread. Sorry :(**

I've passionately wished I was 4 inches (about 10 centimeters) tall since I was about 5 years old. Usually, these fantasies are held by men who fantasize about giantesses. I fantasize about being small and kept by a regular sized male. I've only known that others like me existed for a few years. It's frustrating to want something and obsess about something more than anything in the world and have it be completely impossible. I'm normal in every other way except that I have intense physical reactions whenever I see something that references tiny (below 2 feet tall) women. AMA

(edit) Thanks for the questions!
To make it easier, I will refer to this genre by what I usually call it - SW (shrunken women)
Some other words:
SM (Shrunken Men) GT (Giants or normal sized men with sw) GTS (Giantesses or normal sized women with sw)

I was in my third year of an Engineering degree before deciding I was far to miserable to keep going. I dropped out halfway through, got a cheap 2 bedroom place with my girlfriend, and got a job doing hospital security. It pays well enough that the two of us have no worries about money, and can afford to eat well and buy movies when they come out and go out a lot, but not enough to afford a big house and amazing Bahamas' vacations, but I am happier then I was since before High School and all the pressure to succeed.

1337957450.0	u4iwp	IAmA 24 yr old female that was raised by parents that believed they were descendants from reptilian aliens.	hypecat	121	13	92	"My mother is a very smart woman that chooses to believe the most far out conspiracies that are out there.  She will bastardize them into a morphed belief system she has constructed for herself, and I was lucky enough to be raised by parents that told their daughter she was the descendant of reptilian overlords.  One day these people would return for us before they ultimately destroyed this planet.   

My mom threaded the writings of David Icke and the preaching of Art Bell to make her own twisted world  in which to raise her child.  She choose to identify with the villain of the whole NWO super theory and remind me constantly that because of my blood I was more susceptible to evil than most so watch the fuck out.   She did not promote or propagate evil.  She just felt we were doomed for it.  

I believed this until I was about 10 and realized that she was crazy.  She would make me ask all of my friends blood types to ensure that I only had pure friends that I would not miss when I was gone.   My mom still believes we are connected to this evil force somehow but she converted to Christianity when I was 12.  She says she has a direct umbilical cord to Christ and he understand the way she chooses to worship and believe.  I hear, ""No one in the Church would put up with my batty ass conspiracy theories, so I stay home and listen to fire and brimstone preaching on the radio followed by hours of Coast to Coast re-runs.""

I turned out relatively normal.  I do not talk to my family very much.  When I tell people about my mother and upbringing, most do not believe me so I simply take them to meet my mom and it doesn't take long for the crazy talk to begin.  I commented about this the other day in AskReddit and had an overwhelming response from people with questions so I decided to make an AMA.   The reptilian overlord thing was not the only crazy thing she believed but it certainly is the most interesting.

TL;DR- I was raised to believe I was a reptoid alien overlord descendant set to inherit the earth.  I grew out of it."	t5_2sxwp	True

While we're out, we hear a scream. Not like a girl, but a man. We rush over to a small alley where two guys were beating up another guy and they started choking him and beating him. 

They didn't see us, and I was lucky enough to have learned tae kwon do. I told my friend to call the cops and I ran up to them. I told them to stop and that the police were coming, but one turned to me and went to punch me. I ducked down and punched him right in the gut, then into the chest and started kicking him. His friend ran over, and my other friend came back and body checked him right to the ground. Minutes later, the police came and arrested the two guys.

While I was out with my girlfriend she had him change my locks and refuse me entry.

I have been staying at a friends house for two days trying to collect my thoughts and form a plan, and intended to go to the youth shelter down the road, but after a metric fuckton of phone calls, there is not a free bed in the city. My friend has gone out of town for the weekend and his parents, who are unaware I've been here, will be home all weekend. I have barricaded myself in his room with subpar provisions and am typing this from my phone. I will call all the shelters again tomorrow in an attempt to find a legitimate bed before he returns.

I'm 18 years old and I am sexually attracted to young girls, usually aged 7 - 15.

I thought this was normal until I reached about 16, when my friends started calling me a 'pervert' for always talking to young girls at my school and asking people if they found ""so-and-so in Year 8"" attractive. I realised then that I have a sexual attraction to very young girls, and that this is seen as wrong in society. I am currently undergoing psychological re-adjustment to help me change, because of the abuse and bullying I have received at school.

I have had 2 serious, long-term relationships in my life, the first being with a girl 3 years younger than me (who I lost my virginity to when she was 13) and the second being just a year younger than me (who I broke up with just 3 days ago after 2 years together). 

I have never, and *will* never sexually abuse any young girl or watch child pornography, because both are strictly against the law and are immoral. However, having this as a sexual orientation is obviously difficult, as I do not find anyone my age or older attractive and thus I know i'll probably spend the rest of my life alone. For that reason, I will openly admit to reddit that I masturbate using 'jailbait gallery' forums, on which I am an active member.

**I want to clear up the topic and make this a bit less of a taboo, so please, ASK ME ANYTHING.**

*and be nice, it's taken a lot of guts to come on here and talk about it.*

Below is the verbatim text of the original post:

Lately on reddit the topic seems to be rape everywhere I look. Often times discussions back and forth about the rape of males follows. I don’t normally think about my own experiences but they’ve been on mind because of this lately and I’ve been tempted so many times when someone posts something about male rape but I just didn’t know how to drop my own experiences into conversation. So here are my two stories in their entirety. I don’t even know where to post them and I'm sorry if IAmA isn't appropriate. I will not verify my identity ever, nor do I have any proof of my experiences. I don’t even know how many questions I’ll be able or willing to answer. I guess all I can say is believe me or not, here it is for you to know. Maybe it will help someone else in a way I can’t even imagine.

The first event occurred my sophomore year in high school. Not a true rape by the legal definition I guess, more a molestation on its way to rape where it not for luck. I had already reached my full height of 6' by that time and weighed in at around 180 lbs. None of that would help me though that night though.

At the time I lived in a midwestern state shaped vaguely like a pan, in a small town of about 4k people surrounded by corn and cows. Some friends and I heard about a large party going on out on the rez (reservation) and thought it sounded like fun. And it was fun to start, we all got shitfaced and everyone was laughing. The name of the game was “up and down the river”. And the sub game was get the white boys drunk. Everybody was a winner, but I won grand prize and shortly thereafter passed out. The last thing I remember was being dragged into a back bedroom and dropped on the floor, the lights went out and so did I.

An unknown length of time later I realized I was in pain, that’s the first thing I noticed. The second was that someone was groping me and I couldn’t breathe right. Panic set in and I started struggling and that’s when she said it. She whispered in my ear, “Tonight I’ll make you a real man.” And I knew immediately who she was and what was about to happen.

I only knew her indirectly; she was the wife of the older brother of the friend who told me about the party. I will name her Virginia Trottinghorse, name changed to protect myself, and here is what I knew about her: Mid 30’s, about a hand taller than I was and easily twice my weight, and she had my pants pulled down and was lying on top of me with one hand shoved down my underwear grabbing me there very tightly. Her breath was rank with cigarettes and beer as she grunted in my ear. Wordless mostly but occasionally she would throw in an insult or threat and she kept demanding that I get hard for her. “Come on you pussy, get it up for me.” When I struggled against her she would put her weight down with her arm on my neck and choke me, the world swimming I would lay still and then she’d let up and resume grinding on me. After what felt like forever the door swung open and someone turned on the light, but even exposed she still didn’t stop.

My savior was a guy I’ll name Derrin, and he just stood and stared for a while as I gasped for him to help me and she squirmed over me violently squeezing and shaking my special purpose. Finally he drug her off me and she flipped him the bird as she stormed out, leaving just him and me, my pants down and tears running down my face, and him just looking down at me pathetically. Over the din outside the room I could hear Virginia announcing to everyone that I was a pussy who couldn’t get it up, and then the laughter, the humiliating laughter from everyone outside. To this day I don’t know which made me feel worse her groping me or the laughter.

I quietly pulled my pants up while Derrin watched over me, and then I crawled out the window into the dark and have never uttered a word about what happened that night to anyone until today, nearly twenty years later.

The second rape happened about 10 years after that. I’m going to be intentionally vague about a lot of details here because they would be very revealing. I was in the armed forces and stationed very far away from home. Everything was going great and I was having the time of my life. I had met and fell madly in love with a foreign girl and we were married just that year. It was a very emotional relationship, looking back I can see how dysfunctional it was but at the time it was amazing and the bad bits were “worth it”. She had an anger issue, that’s about the best way to put it, that and the kind of jealousy that makes normally jealous people feel uncomfortable.

The spats we had with increasing frequency often led to the destruction of things I valued. A stereo here, some pants there, and from time to time a broken finger if I didn’t get it out of door jamb fast enough or a bruised face. And they always ended with me capitulating to whatever mistake I may have made or that she imagined I had made and begging for her forgiveness. I wish that younger me had been a bit stronger, I wish he felt about himself the way I do now. At the time I thought I knew what I was doing, my mother was wrong about her and I was going to make this work; until one rainy day in April when my eyes were opened wide.

This fight was different, not because of the volume of the screaming, nor the belongings strewn out into the street. Not even the reason for the anger was unusual, and to be honest I don’t recall the fighting was about, we may have not even known at the time. In the end it seemed to be burning out the same as it always did. She was throwing me out, it was over. I was on my knees begging her to stop and to forgive me, to take me back. And that’s when she said it. “If you want me to forgive you, you will have to fuck me.” To which she then added that I must not enjoy it. That’s when this train left the station for crazy town.

I asked her what she was talking about and she ignored me and took off her robe, lay down on the bed and then repeated the order. I was to fuck her and not enjoy it. I refused and she told me to leave and that it was over. I begged some more and she just lay there, hate in her eyes, waiting for me to do what she asked. And so I did, and it was the worst thing I’ve ever done. She wouldn’t make eye contact with me but if I looked away she would scream in my face to look, and then her eyes would drift back to the wall and she made sounds of disgust and ordered me to just finish already and what was taking me so long? I started crying and said I couldn’t do it, I couldn’t finish like this and then she really lashed out. Insults and curses, telling me I was always a lousy lover, that I was too small to please her, that she had always been disappointed. She even mocked me that I normally don’t take so long. And then came the fury, I got so angry with her and what she was saying and she saw it on my face. For a second I think she was concerned that she was losing control of the situation, and then just like that I finished. She shot one last snipe at me about never pleasing her, rolled over and told me to get out.

Like the cliché, I went to the shower and wept. I sat under the water and cried like a child until the hot water ran out. After that things drug on for another month, autopilot really, we didn’t fight anymore but then we didn’t really talk or interact either. I discreetly bought a plane ticket, and then on the day of my flight told her I had a job offer in the states and would be in touch when I got set up. She didn’t even put up a token argument. I took next to nothing with me, a backpack with a change of clothes and a few other small trinkets, boarded the train and other than mailing divorce paperwork a few years later never spoke with her again.

And that’s it, my experience summed up in 3 pages. I don’t have much left to add to this, just a parting thought. The events themselves weren’t the worst part. They were terrible yes, but brief and disorienting. The worst part is the shame, waves and waves of it and it just goes on and on until you can’t remember who you were before it came. Even years later they just spring up and bury you. For those of you who know what I mean, I’m sorry."	t5_2sxwp	True
1372726719.0	1hgrm6	I have a tulpa (Sentient imaginary friend), AMA!	Leah-theRed	147	58	233	"BUT before you ask anything, a brief description of a tulpa:

&gt;A tulpa is believed to be an autonomous consciousness, existing within their creator’s mind, often with a form of their creator's initial choice and design.

&gt;A tulpa is entirely sentient and in control of their opinions, feelings, form and movement.

&gt;They are willingly created by people via a number of techniques to act as companions, muses, and advisers.

(You can find a more full definition [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_a_tulpa.3F))

------------------------------------

I'm a 21 years old, female, and have had a tulpa since around the age of 11 or 12. He started off as a 'mary sue' type character that I used in tons of stories and fan fiction, that I eventually made meta and asked his opinions of his stories and lives. I started to talk with him more and more, and eventually he was someone I spoke to regularly in my mind, and who I pictured with me at school and home, as just a cool friend.

Around the age of 17 I had a fit of paranoia and worry, that someone I was possibly going mentally ill and I sort of banished him from my life. He would show up a few times a year, making sure I was okay when things were going tough (I moved, lost jobs, got new jobs that sucked, lost jobs again, dealt with family members passing) but otherwise stayed silent, knowing what I thought of him. 

About the beginning of April I found the subreddit /r/tulpas and found that other people do this BUT ON PURPOSE. I was a little in shock at first, and then kind of brought that other part of my subconcious back to life.

He renamed himself January, says he's 24, and has the attitude of an angry badger.

AND before you ask, yes, I realize he is not 'real' and I don't make claims otherwise. If I felt the need I could force him away again, but really who doesn't have arguments with themselves or the like?

For more info, the /r/tulpas [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/wiki/faq).

Ask anything you want of me or January! If he feels the need to speak I'll enclose what he says in []'s. So AMA!

I think my experience is a little unique in that my mother is a highly scholastically educated woman (Master's degree, a BS and a BA, her RN, etc. etc.) yet completely undermined all that with the degree of her brutality towards me and how well she hid it.

When we first were introduced to the religion, I was 8 or 9 years old. Two years later my mother turned to me while she was cooking and per her own words and my own recollection, proceeded to stab me twice in my left shoulder because of a look I gave her. From that day forward my life was never going to be the same.

Go ahead and ask me anything, I have a ton of things I can share from how I got free of her to escaping to British Columbia to live for a few years where I found out how 'normal' people interacted.

I ended up moving in with [Alex Sanders](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Alex_Sanders,_Phyllisha_Anne_at_April_Storm's_Birthday_Party_2.jpg#filehistory). I had a lot of fun and made some great friends that I still have today. I knew his girlfriend/wife Phyllisha Anne as well. She was super cool.


When I first moved in he told me that he was redoing the house and that he was going to be renting it out as a location. If I was ok with that, the rent would be pretty cheap, considering, and on top of that I get a cool roommate.


Alex was a cool cat. He didn't party much and played computer games nonstop. So he was always available and worked a lot. I've seen him with the hottest chicks in porn.


While hanging out with Alex I also got to know 2 of the big directors of the business, [Michael Raven](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Raven) and [Jonathan Morgan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Morgan_(director)). All 4 of us used to play video games together, mainly Halo, but plenty of others. I also did a little bit of rough editing for them. Rough editing is the grunt work and they paid me very well in cash by the hour. Mainly because they knew me, they trusted me in their house on their machines, and I did an ok job.


At the time Michael was married to Julia Ann and Morgan was dating a skinny girl from Wicked, who's name escapes me at the time. These guys all took care of me back in the day and I have nothing but love for them."	t5_2sxwp	True

I really relate to Jesse's character because I didn't do too well in school but when it came to clandestine applied sciences I became one of the best, in fact I can tell you 
If one were to use Methylamine as a precursor like in the show the end product would be racemic (50/50 Levo/Dextro) methamphetamine, which means it would be weaker than normal meth with harsher effects on the body because  Levo-methamphetamine is a vasoconstrictor and has little to no CNS activity.(though it would hold a powerful reagent known as ""the  placebo effect"" but this can be achieved through blue food coloring or even blue chalk to save cost in the cook).

I took pride in my work, I even got into making MDMA and lsd(I met some of the greatest lsd cooks in the country before they got arrested, check out neurosoup on youtube for that story).  I was also depressed, I'd lost a girlfriend to heroin addiction, many friends.  In many ways my life mirrored the show right down to Jesse's home, speakers, equalizer and roomba(I even went from the baggy rockawear/volcom style clothes to affliction, Tre Vero leather jackets,and archaic shirts).  One day when I was catching up on season 5 a friend said ""wow look at all the money Jesse has and how he lives"".  I looked around my living room, she said ""sorry"" and after thinking of the life and family both Walt and Jesse were throwing away I went and looked into going to college so I could contribute to society rather than harm it.

I was born in Australia in 1985 by my mum, a single mother, because my father committed suicide in 1986. My mother often went from working four casual jobs at a time, to not working at all because she ""did not feel like it anymore"" and living off a small amount of money from the government (I have a brother who has mental disabilities so she recieved compensation). I believe she is undiagnosed bi-polar because of how erratic she would be about this.

I was a fine in school until grade 3, when I stopped progressing as fast as other students. I was held back in grade 3, and when I didn't improve I was put into special education. Sometimes, apparently, I made small improvements but I basically went back and forth until I could legally exit school in grade 10 when I was sixteen. I could still not read or write any better than a 9 year old. I got worse over the years.

For about six years I worked as a cleaner and janitor for a small firm in the city but even that was hard not being able to read properly. It was a small business with links to the special education unit my brother and I were in, and the owner knew me and didn't fire me, I'm very grateful. 

After a few years, he decided that it wasn't feasible to keep paying me for a job I couldn't do and when I was no longer making money my mother kicked me out. it was a very hard few years, and when I was 22 to when I was about 24 I was basically homeless (being truely homeless in this country is very hard without a mental illness, I believe!). A social worker eventually got me on the right track with adult education, and in less than a year I had learnt to read and write to a high-school level (I was 25.) I've only gotten better!

I asked a stranger to have sex and it worked.
  
Now I've done this many times since this particular event, however this time was particularly memorable (and successful).
  
I had been at a friends house party drinking a few ciders and beers, I decided I would take a walk to the local convenience store (it was late , sometime between 11pm - 1am). The store was about a 30 minute walk from the party. 
  
I was about half way to the store and I spotted 3 people (MFF) walking on the other side of the road, I had a bit of a buzz on and was feeling a little cocky so I moved to cross to their side of the road.
As I was crossing they made a move to cross over the road too, we met at the median and I said hello to the the trio. 
  
After a brief chat two of these people excused themselves (MF) and left me alone with some bird (to this day I can't recall her name). I had been chatting with her for a solid 2 minutes by this point and slowly started to edge closer to her and eventually had my arms around her. Total time from crossing the road to this point would be less than 2.5 minutes.
  
After a quick quick snog the decision was made to go elsewhere and get more comfortable, we crossed the road and walked into the front gardens of the local private school. The grass was soft and lush, we stripped each other and got down to business.
  
That's my tale, from spotting her across the road to putting our clothes back on would have been a total of 10 minutes, she was (and still is) a total stranger I had sex with and a never spent a penny on her or bought her and drinks.

Here is the garden where it all went down. http://goo.gl/maps/medcg

1372490251.0	1hau60	I am adopted and I met my biological parents and their kids when I was 22. I am thirty five now, this is my story	TheJerk666	94	10	22	"Growing up I always knew I was adopted. I had two sisters, one older, one younger who were also adopted. My Parents were devout Catholics who couldn't conceive on their own. I was born in 1977 and records weren't horrible like they were in the fifties, but they weren't that great either. All I knew was my biological mother was 17 ,maybe Irish, and was too young to keep me. My Father was Jewish. That's it. 

My life was normal, my father made decent money and my family was my family. It was all I knew. Blood is blood, but you do not have to come from her whom for your mother to be your mother. Sometimes when I was younger I would talk to other people who were adopted and share stories. As it turns out I had a relatively gifted experience. Many people I have met had to leave a bad situation in order to arrive at a good one. I was adopted when I was two weeks old, and had a loving family since that day. I always knew somehow that I would meet my bio parents but as I turned 21 it did seem to be a fading thought. 
I was living in South Pasadena with a girl I was with. We had met in northern California but she was pursuing a modeling career in LA and I followed her down. One day I got a call from my Dad saying that he had a letter from my birth father. He was asking me if I wanted it. So I says ""Yeah send it to me."" A few days later I had the letter in my hand. It was short, ""my name is biodad, I've always thought about you, I'd love to talk to you, the end."" 

He had run into my Biomom one day in a train station about the time I was 14. She grabbed him by the throat and said if he ever contacted me she was to be the first to know. It was a pretty sour experience for her. She was a young rebellious teenager growing up in the suburbs of Washington DC in the 70's with 4 siblings and a dad in federal law enforcement. Her parents were also devout Christians, although not Catholics. She however is quite like me and is somewhere between agnostic and atheist. Biodad came from a Russian Jewish family. His mom died when he was 13 and his father raised three boys on his own. While Biomom's father was indispensably helpful, Biodad's father was a dick. Well, that is to say he acted like a dick, but I understand that it was a hard situation to be in. He sat Biomom down in his office next to Biodad and scolded them for about twenty minutes and then told her she had to ""take care of it, and that he wouldn't support the baby."" At that moment Biomom was looking for Biodad to stand up for her but he just slouched and she lost all respect for him. 

She tells me I went to a Led Zeppelin concert when she was 6&amp;1/2 months, kicking the whole time. (she recently gave me a concert tshirt from that tour) When I was born she held me for three days in the hospital. Her father told her that she could bring the baby home if she wanted and that the family would help her. My Biomom, being as selfless as she was decided that she couldn't give me the proper life that somebody else who is dying to have a kid could. In the most generous gesture that exists in this life, she gave me away to another family. A gift to everybody.

Fast forward 22 years later. Biodad feeling like the window was closing contacts the adoption agency. He figured when 21 happened that if I was searching for him it would have happened by then. So he asks the agency what he can do. They tell him that he can send a letter to my parents through the agency. Because of the laws involved we had to get in touch with each other through a third party website. That way the agency wasn't directly facilitating the reunion.It started off with a few phone calls and before I knew it I was on my way to Dulles Airport in Virginia to meet my Biological father.




Pause......now just soak that in for a minute. I grew up with out a genetic identity. Nobody looked like me. We didn't waive any flags. My friends families all had flags, traditions, and more importantly heritage. My real parents were Irish and Italian, but we never had any of that nationalism growing up. So for the first time I was about to go meet a guy who would look like me and who would represent all of out father before him. He ended looking like my older brother. It was awesome. He was like an older brother too. He was 41 I think, single, successful player in the DC area. He showed me around his life, we went back to his apartment and he started telling me I needed to call Biomom. Now this wasn't the first time he had said it, he told me the story earlier about her choking him in the train station. He also told me that when he contacted me he called her parents (my grandparents) trying to get a hold of her. When he told them his name they hung up. This really freaked me out because I didn't think I could handle rejection at that point. He swore up and down that they wouldn't.

Anyways he convinces me to do it and 2 minutes later I am talking to my aunt for the first time ever. I say ""Hi, my name is theJerk666 and I am the baby Biomom gave up 22 years ago""-------silence(15 seconds)-----bu,bu,pa,what? really? (freak out) OMG!!! Crying me, Crying her, small chat who I am, more crying, here talk to your grandmother, repeat. It was really incredible. So my aunt gets back on and says give me your number and I'll call Biomom and have her call you back. 25 seconds go by. Ring! ""hello, this is BioSon"" ""crying, where are you? I'm on my way to get you"" Twenty minutes later I was opening the door for my mom for the first time ever. I'd never seen her face before. I looked just like her. The very first words I ever said to her were Thank You. And then we embraced and cried for a good ten minutes. When it was over and we got a chance to inspect each other we were instant chemistry. Very Very much alike in personality, however equally opposite in regards to genderish issues. 

We got in her minvan and drove to her house where I met my 13 year old sister. I remember walking up to her and telling her I was her older brother and she just gave me a big hug. It melted my heart, and still does. There was also a 5 year old sister and two twins a boy and a girl who were just babies. All of a sudden my family exploded. It tripled over night. I had no idea what was coming next. 

When news spread that I had come back the whole Irish family rolled out. The next morning I woke up at 8am to about 35 people waiting to meet me. Half adults and half kids. Everybody always knew about me. It wasn't a big secret, and when I returned they made me feel so welcome. Also there was a very strong sense of Irish pride. My family had come from the Pennsylvania coal mines and had laid their lives down for their families, my family. This was the first time ever I knew about my family heritage. It was a life changing experience. I had booked the flight for just a weekend. That way if things went bad I could be out of there quick. I ended up staying for two weeks.
 
Since then I see Biomom once or twice a year. It used to be more but I have a family of my own now. When I first got back I ran and tracked down my best friend who came from a proud Irish family. I burst in and proclaimed ""guess what, I'm Irish!"" That woman is now my wife, In fact Biomom officiated my wedding, and I walked both my mothers down the aisle, one on each arm. It was sweet. The kids are getting older and they all alternate coming out here in the summer. We have a tradition of taking them on a local canoeing trip every time they come. We all talk once or twice a week, and my son is lucky enough to have met his great grandparents several times. The last time was a few months ago for their 60th anniversary and family reunion. Great Grandma died two weeks after that. Great Grand pa or G-man as he likes to be called is hanging in their but is sure to be reunited with is love soon.

As for Biodad, At first we kept in contact and I even went to his wedding a few years later in upstate New York. It was fun, made out with his ex wife's friend who was there and I hooked up with one of the bride's maids in a fort in the woods.(epic) But we have drifted apart and I think we just don't like each other. He has a couple of kids and I feel bad that I am not in their life but we just don't get along. Every once in a while I post a comment on his FB page but that's about it.
Well, that's it. Thanks for reading, I had fun writing it. I've told this story a million times but I actually cried a little while retelling it here.

Me and a girl (let's call her Rachel) became fast friends through many things in common. Mostly what we were fans of (such as shows, books, and video games). We bonded over those kinds of stuff, and to her, I was the only person she could talk to about all of that.

Through that we got very close to the point of pretty much telling each other everything. I wouldn't say we were the best of friends (because, keep in mind, we still hadn't known each other very long) but since we lived pretty far apart, we didn't run in each other's friend circles and we didn't see each other that much. Also meaning, we didn't really mention one another to our own friends. It was like having someone to talk to, but not have to commit to as much.

Rachel had a past of paranoia that everyone somehow would leave her. She was always afraid that one day she would have no friends and I sympathized for her. As any friend would, one day when she was having one of those paranoia attacks, I told her ""don't worry about it, I'm here for you. I love you""

I had no idea she would take the ""I love you"" in a different way than I meant it. She asked me ""Do you really?"". I was confused, of course I loved her...as a friend. So I told her I did, because I really did care about her well being,  I loved her as a good friend.

That wasn't what she thought I meant at all. 

Rachel asked me if we could date. I got so flustered. I was an awkward girl (still am). I didn't know she was a lesbian, we never talked about that kind of stuff. We only talked about general life problems and geeked about different things.

I didn't know what to do...so I said yes. I regretted it every single day, but I couldn't build up the courage to break it off and tell her ""Oops, sorry, I didn't mean it that way. I never wanted to date you, I'm not even a lesbian. I'm straight"".

And with Rachel's paranoia, I knew it would mentally scar her if I did that. There was nothing my mind could think of to get me out of that situation without hurting her further and not seeming like a complete bitch. 

It ended 4 months later. She broke up with me. I had never felt so free in my entire life. Of course I regret it. It's been almost 6 years and I still regret it. I never tell people about this, so have at me Reddit. 

Ask me anything!

*tl;dr: Told a new friend I loved her, she took it the wrong way and asked if we could date. Flustered me said yes. Didn't have the heart to tell her not only did I not love her in that way, I wasn't even a lesbian. She broke up with me 4 months later.*

*****

Hey, I'm back with an update as promised! Everything's healed up nicely and 90% of the stitches are gone. I think there might be one or two left still, but they're fading real quick. It's gotten to the point where I can touch the cut line directly without any pain, unless I go purposely poke at the last few stitches, where it irritates a little.

Being cut has been a lot different from being uncut. My head is now fully exposed all the time, compared to it being about half covered before, when soft.

Even though I shower every day (And I'm not really that active of a person), by the end of the day, things would get a bit funky down there, especially underneath the foreskin. Not enough to actually think ""Oh god this is awful"", but just a minor smell. Now, there's none.

Related to the above, the inside of my foreskin used to get a bit sticky from sweat and ""other bodily fluids"". This made it a bit uncomfortable, because when it's slightly sticky and it slides around, it really starts to chafe and it feels like my bits are suffocating down there. I think every person with boy bits knows how uncomfortable it is when your balls stick to your leg. Well, it's the same feeling, just with the foreskin. This is one of the reasons that I decided to get cut, actually.

Overall, it's been a huge improvement in my everyday life. Before, I'd have to adjust my underpants quite a bit because the foreskin's caught back and the head is uncomfortably rubbing against my pants, or because it's sticking and I have to unstick it. Now, it sits comfy and it doesn't bother me anymore.

Also, one of the commonly stated facts about circumcision is that there will be no more smegma, and it's true.

As for the part everyone was curious about, the first time I did *it* after the operation was about 5 days after. I couldn't touch the cut line without it being painful, so I did what I could underneath it, and on the head itself. It actually hurt quite a bit to get the job done, but 5 days was just getting a little bit long!

There were a few times since then, but I haven't been able to touch the cut line until yesterday. I'd say yesterday would count as the first ""real"" one since, and that's what I'm basing this comparison on: It's a lot better cut. The way I'd describe it is that uncut masturbation is like mountains and sharp peaks of sensation that ends in climax, and cut masturbation is like a smooth paved road that isn't as steep, but the ending is stronger, and the sensation is entirely different. The slight tension of the skin drawn tight when erect changes the way stimulation feels, I think. Just like how lightly running your fingers over your palm is a different sensation than pushing hard and doing the same thing, that's pretty much how cut/uncut differs.

Of course the inevitable question is, did the level of sensitivity change? Yes, it did. But it's not more or less, it's different. It's not objectively better or worse, it's a completely different sensation, and I just prefer it like this over how it feels when uncut.

I think I covered most of what people are curious about, but as usual feel free to ask anything."	t5_2sxwp	True

When I was in 10th-12th grades, I had sex with my history teacher on a regular basis. I'm in college now (20 years old) and I've managed to not sleep with any teachers quite yet.

I'm a bit drunk so I figured what the hell, ask away!

1373470360.0	1i0gjk	I was in a relationship where I was manipulated and lied to. I did not find out until after we broke up and I was threatened with a lawsuit. AMA	BecauseICamp	110	39	59	"I apologize for the length, however, it is necessary.

I dated a girl for 18 months.  Throughout that relationship I did work for her family's business, of which she was a partner.  When we would get into an argument, she would say, ""Why are we even together?""  I got tired of hearing it, so I would say, ""OK, we are done.""  She would then hurt herself, scratching herself with her nails or keys.  This would pull me back to take care of her and we would get back together.  It truly was a vicious cycle.

Her parents owned a remodeling company, of sorts, being vague on purpose.  I was looking to make a little extra cash, I worked retail.  I told her I was looking for a second job and she told me that she spoke with her father and the other partner, and said that they wanted to hire me to do design work.  They would pay me $20/hr plus a 10% commission on whatever I sold/project I worked on.

I did this work for about 8 months without being paid, there was always some excuse, the transfer didn't go through, they didn't have checks, they wanted to pay me in cash but didn't have enough on hand, etc.

Like a sap, I believed her.  There came a point that I could no longer afford to do the work and not be paid.  I told her that next time I saw her father, I was going to ask him why I haven't been paid.  She said that she would talk to him.  A few days later, I get paid. 

About a month after that we get into a huge fight.  I was going to sleep at my house because I was not sleeping well at hers because of her new dog.  Another one of those, ""Why are we together?"" comments came up and I said, ""Fine, we are done.""  She goes into the kitchen and cuts herself with a chef's knife, badly.  I rush in and grab her arm to put pressure on it, call 911, and wait for them to arrive.  She goes to the ER, my friend comes and gets me and takes me home.

Her father reaches out to me to ask what happened, I told him.  He asks if we can talk, I say sure.  He comes over the next night and he starts asking me about her and money.  I, being unaware that I was lied to, tells him.  After, he tells me that she was not a partner and did work there.  At most she answered the phone for a week or so.  He asks what kind of work I did and I show him, I save everything (good thing too).  He tells me that I need to go get the money and give it back, I for some reason tell him that I will see what I can do.  I talk to my good friend, lawyer, and he informs me that I have a right to money because, despite the jobs were fake, I worked under the pretense that I was legitimately employed.  About 3 weeks later I get a letter from the family's attorney stating that I owe them $10k and that they are going to sue me if I do not pay them within 7 days, which, as I made $33k a year, would be impossible.

My friend tells me to not respond and to write up the entire history of my working relationship with my now ex, just in case they did sue. (I will post this once I remove any personally identifiable info).

I even went as far as to block her and her parent’s numbers, because she would call me from their phone to trick me into answering.

I have not heard from them since.  However, I have saved every document, email, and text in case they ever do sue me.

TL:DR - I was in an 18 month relationship where I was manipulated and lied to.  I only found out when her parents threatened to sue me.  I had to block all of their numbers and I haven't heard from them since."	t5_2sxwp	True

Conclusion: Well, at least one person is asking how it went.  It was, overall, fine I'd say.  Not great, but not terrible.  I was so nervous at the beginning that I could barely speak a coherent sentence, and my face was bright red for about 10 min.  But I pushed through that, and we ended up having a solid 1h45m- long conversation (mostly carried by her).  So I'm still alive, but jesus, I think that about shredded my last nerve, and I've just been sitting here feeling completely fucked-out.  What high-octane living.  Anyway, I asked her at if she wanted to get together again, and she said yes.  But through a sort of grotesque lensing process I've interpreted this to mean that she wasn't really that thrilled with me and only took the path of least resistance when put the question directly.  I suppose I'll ask her out again (through text) and see what happens.

Indeed, in my country, there are legal workarounds for the rich and the opportune to avoid conscription, but in my opinion, to do this is just to submit to the state and accept that conscription is a morally legitimate concept. This makes it so that military ranks are determined by social class, not by merit, and largely unfair the lower socioeconomic classes. Fortunately, I was lucky to be born in adequate circumstances.

I know that my parents will not approve of this, and that the concept of leaving the country and not looking back would be certain lunacy to my father. Right now I am still a student, and still have a few years for the draft.

1366852248.0	1d1ux3	I am a male victim of rape AMA	trev1776	85	14	26	"Hello, I am a male victim of a rape when I was 13 years old. I have also been counselor and confidant of two very close personal friends who have gone through similar situations.  I have recently revealed all this information to a friend of mine who is earning her psychology degree.  I have decided that I would like to share my story with my fellow redditors in hopes of answering a few questions for the inquiring mind, or in order to help a fellow redditor who is going through a similar situation.  Don’t worry I don’t need support, I am okay haha.  I just wanted to share my story.

Let me start by saying that I have never gone to the police or authorities with any of these cases.  Until recently I have never disclosed any of this information, except to the three friends I have already mentioned.  I will be keeping their names a secret as to prevent any harassment that they may encounter.  I am sorry if I leave out any details, I have only told these stories once before, so the storytelling techniques may not all be there that would normally be there in a well-practiced story.

The first rape story takes place in early 2006.  I do not remember the exact date just a few things about it.  I remember it being a Friday.  Earlier that day I had gotten a test back in school, I was in the 8th grade.  I distinctly remember being extremely disappointed with myself.  I had received my first F on test (First of many might I add haha).  I was hard on my self for the rest of the, but luckily my best friend at the time wouldn’t let me brood.  In this I’ll call her, Karen.  Karen and I met in Kindergarten but had only really become close friends since about 6th grade.  Karen and I didn’t go to the same middle school but we would still talk to each other often, using AIM or calling each other on the phone.  But I’m digressing now.

Karen went to bed that night promising that we would talk the next day.  She had to go to bed earlier than normal because she had a doctor’s early the next morning.  As such I was left alone, brooding on how “stupid I was for getting an F on my history test.”  I still had a 230% in the class, the teacher offered extra credits for turning in more notes, and my friend and I were in competition for the highest grade.  So when an assignment required 3 pages of notes we would sometimes write 25-40 pages!  I remember getting 680/250 points on a packet once because of this. (She got 682 on that assignment and ended up winning the competition.  I think she got a 257% in the class and I ended with a 241%).  But at the time I wasn’t worried about my overall grade just that particular F.

It was around 1AM, when I decided to go outside for a walk.  I snuck out, a fairly simple task since my family is a bunch of rocks when they sleep and proceeded to just walk around my neighborhood.

I was cold.

I didn’t put on a jacket, I don’t remember why.  I think I was in too big of a rush.  I didn’t really get cold until I had been gone for about 15 minutes, and by then I figured I would just finish my walk.  I was walking past my elementary school when I heard something behind me.  I looked over my shoulder fairly disinterested at whatever cat or dog had ran into a garbage can and didn’t see anything.

I should mention that I have done this walk dozens of times.  I was used to the random noises and I didn’t really get startled anymore.  That being said, it was on this night that I actually got panicked from the noise.  I didn’t make any sudden movements just continued my casual stroll.  I remember scaring myself even more by imagining that a mountain lion or something similar was behind me.  No sooner than these thoughts had gone through my head did I find myself pulled into someone and hand was covering my mouth.  I felt something sharp digging into my back, I tried to fight back.  I had been in Karate for 7 years and I knew a thing or two about fighting.  (I was actually crowned a world champion twice, once in sparring and once in breaking.  Both of these were at a tournament in Las Vegas.)

However the man was much bigger than I was, he was dragging me so I couldn’t move my feet into any fightable position.  The knife (or whatever the sharp thing was, I always assumed it was a knife) was in my back, so trying to shake him off could’ve been bad, so I sorta had to let him drag me.  We went into an alley and he threw me down, before I could move he had my face in the ground, and well I think you can guess what happened from here and I won’t go into any details.

When he was finished he left me there crying and screaming for help.  No help ever came, I later found it was because of the location.  It was behind a dentists office, the nearest buildings were my old elementary school and the public library, both of which would be empty at 1:30 in the morning.  I eventually picked myself up, rubbed my sore and abused ass and walked home.  No one knew and I wasn’t going to tell anyone.

I didn’t  really know how to react to this.  All I really knew was that I didn’t want to talk to anybody, but I wanted to be held.  My mom was happy to oblige my new cuddly habit as was my friend Karen.  I didn’t really talk for those few months afterwards.  Only over AIM and the like.  Phone calls were short and awkward, I wouldn’t speak out in class, or talk to my friends.  I eventually broke out of this, slowly.  I don’t think anybody that I was close to during that period of my life really knew.  I guess eventually I just shoved the memory to the back of my brain and kinda forgot about it.  I went on living my life.  

I may decide to reveal the other two stories later.  I feel deeply responsible for both of the incidents though I will answer any questions if they do come up.

1341159577.0	vvsca	IAMA 33yo male heterosexual crossdresser and just yesterday I told my wife about it. My wife and I will both answer your questions. AMA [NSFW]	Bigshow281	95	28	41	"I have been secretly crossdressing in the privacy of my own bedroom my entire life for the purpose of sexual gratification and never told anyone about it...until yesterday when I told my wife. My wife is a bi-sexual 27 yo and I am a heterosexual 33 yo and we will both answer your questions. The reason why my wife and I want to do this AMA is because I have lived with my fetish/hobby for about 25 years in complete guilt and shame and I want to help men who live in shame doing this and also provide some perspective to ladies that might have a man that has this hobby. If we can help one man out there feel less shameful for his crossdressing hobby and if we can help one woman to be more open and understanding of their man's hobby then this AMA is worth the time and effort to me.

I very much enjoy being a man, I like things that guys typically like except for sports. I have never experimented with members of the same sex and never had the desire to, I very much love women and femininity. I am masculine but am also a gentle man at the same time.

I was so scared to tell her but because I knew how open minded she was sexually, I decided to finally get it off my chest after keeping it a secret my entire life. After I told her, not only was she not mad about it, but she wanted to see my secret collection. She told me the idea of seeing me in ladies' undies turned her on and made her lady bits tingle. She told me this was new territory for her and she wasn't sure if she would like it but even if she didn't, she would encourage me to continue crossdressing even if she wasn't into it because she wanted me to do something that makes me happy.

So I took a leap of faith and went into my closet and pulled out my backpack full of my pretties. I have collected secretly over time some nice silky bras, night gowns, assorted satin sissy panties, thigh high stockings, and camisoles. I took each item out one by one and handed them to her. My face was red with shame. She would slowly and gently feel the soft feel of the satin on each item I handed to her while looking at me with her beautiful loving and understanding eyes. I could tell she was getting turned on. I was finally gaining courage so I asked her if she wanted me to try some of them on for her, she said yes. So I got naked and slipped into my favorite pair of satin panties and pulled them up. Next, I put on a pair of white thigh high stay-up lace top white opaque stockings and then a long purple satin and lace nightie. I turned around so she can see the panties riding up my ass and how the stockings looked on my legs. She was biting her lip, clearly very very aroused.

She whispered and gestured for me to lay down next to her, I did. We started making out and she began running her hands all over my satin nightie, panties, and stockings. She loved feeling my balls and growing hardon through my silky panties. Soon, she put on my other pair of stockings and my other nightie and we began passionately making out like two lesbian lovers. She blew me and then we had hot sex while both of us were dressed up head to toe in sexy silky ladies lingerie. It was the most erotic, liberating, and intimate sexual experience of my entire life.

She says I opened a new door for her, sexually. She never thought she would be into her man wearing ladies lingerie and now she's hooked. Since then, we've been both looking on the internet for new pretty things to order for both of us. The feeling of finally revealing this life-long shameful secret of mine and no longer being ashamed and not feeling like a sexual deviant and pervert anymore is indescribable. I feel like I have been freed from a life-long prison sentence.

TL;DR - I'm a hetero crossdresser that kept it a secret my whole life and I finally told my wife yesterday thanks to Reddit. She ended up liking it, dressed up in lingerie with me, and then she blew me and we had sex together while we were both dressed in lingerie. My hottest sexual fantasy fulfilled."	t5_2sxwp	True

Unfortunate consequences.	purgatori1	92	26	15	"Digging through the depths of reddit, I find this old casualiama: http://redd.it/o0kbv and feel compelled to write something, because I am future you. The story of maintaining a secret, blissful lesbian relationship and consciously deciding to ""bury it"" is my story, too. So much so that I thought 'she', my ex, might have written it (she didn't).

I had subsequent secret lesbian relationships - always invalidating my love for these women by publicly having boyfriends throughout. I married a fantastic guy and made beautiful babies with him. While I never outright disliked sex with men, it never held any passion for me - when I closed my eyes I fantasized about women. No I wasn't abused as a girl, no I'm not depressed or lack sexual confidence. I was violated in college by a boy, but that was long after I recognized men didn't turn me on. I love men, I just don't want to be with one.

I had no good reason for denying my gay-ness. My family is liberal and awesome. My friends couldn't care less. I'm not at all religious and typically don't give a shit what strangers think. I suffocated my love of women because it was easier to be with men. The roles were clear there. Public affection was almost expected, not frowned on. Co-workers and acquaintances automatically assume I am straight (still do) and it seemed pointless to correct that.

But here are the consequences. I lied to people who love me. I used people and was selfishly unfair to both the men and women I loved. I knew all of this and convinced myself that I was heartless. When I did divorce and start dating women openly, I left a wake of confusion behind me, and actually made the road ahead of me more difficult. People think I'm having a mid-life crisis, when I'm finally where I need to be. 

There is a stigma for me even in the gay community. ""Real"" lesbians (the kind that were bullied in high school and college for being out) constantly doubt my gayness and tell me I must be bi-sexual. I'm instantly considered disingenuous when I argue for gay rights -- somewhat fair considering the farce of my marriage. I have no excuse for how I lived, and now have very little credibility when I've finally found love. 

It minimalizes the struggle to say ""just be yourself, just come out"" when a large part of the world isn't ready for that. But it is worth it to be genuine, honest, and trusting that -- when it matters -- good people around you want the opportunity to support you. I realized this later than I should have, and offended them with my lie. 

Tl;dr: denial and lies can be harder than being gay. Find the courage to trust yourself and others. And then be someone they can trust.

[Somebody challenged me](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/d3zub/its_still_possible_my_wife_and_i_just_bought_a/c0xgamz) to do a followup AMA two years later, so here it is.

Ask away.

Note that this is posted in /r/casualiama due to a rules change in /r/iama.

Anticipated questions:

* Are you still in the house?  **Yes, we still own this house.**
* Where is the house?  **Portland, Oregon.**
* What's the house currently worth? **Guessing slightly more than we paid.  Say $225K.  Zillow says just under $200K, but it's a nice property and is in good shape.**
* Mortgage details?  **Around 4% APR, around $200K financed at a fixed rate, 15-year term, 13 years to go.**
* What's the biggest surprise?  **Shouldn't be a surprise, but it was, anyway: how freaking EXPENSIVE it is to own a house.  Current repair is the heat pump.  We're putting $100 into it right now, in the hopes it will last until next Spring.  Replacement cost is about $1500.**
* What do you owe on the house right now?  **About $175K.**
* Has anything major changed since the original AMA?  **Not really.  Wife changed jobs, but is in the same field (insurance) and earning about the same money.**
* What's your household income?  **Still about $100K.**
* What's the biggest thing you've done to the house since you bought it?  **Several things: new hardwood floors in the basement, huge cleanup in the back yard, new garage door.  No major structural changes yet.**
* Still convinced buying a house was a good idea?  **Hell, yeah.  The house will be paid for in 13 years.  We bought at (nearly) the nadir of the market.**
* Thinking of moving?  **No way.  But thinking of buying another house for rental income Real Soon Now.**
* Thing nobody would think to ask, but interesting anyhow: **In-laws moved in immediately after we purchased the house.  It's a big house, about 2700 square feet.  They only moved out 3-4 months ago, so it's been an interesting couple of years.**"	t5_2sxwp	True

Most of my family and friends are ""average,"" and I often lie about my intelligence so as not to appear snobbish or a know-it-all. Most recent example: I lied to my grandparents about my AP scores (I took five this this year, four last year, and got 5's on all of them.) and my PSATs ( in sixth grade I got perfect scores) so as to not overshadow my cousin's scores. 
When I was little, I had several ""freaky"" child prodigy moments, scared my teachers and parents quite a bit. At the time I thought it was freaking hilarious. 
Stories to ask me about: teaching myself multiplication and division of large numbers at the age of 3 and a half, confusing the local librarian, and, of course, my creepy baby moments (before I could walk I had a fascination with tessellating and reoccurring patterns, sorting things, and math).

I'm polyamorous, which means that I maintain multiple romantic relationships, both sexual and non-sexual, at the same time.

I also have lived with three 24/7 slaves since I got started with BDSM 6 years ago. I'm out to all of my friends, the family that I care about, and most of my co-workers. I'm also an evil evil sadist who delights in the screams of other (consensual) partners.

Oh, I also have a sociopath father that I barely survived living with most of my early life.

Everyone is crazy about opals here. Most people can't wait 'till they're sixteen so they can get their mining license. Just the prospect of being lucky enough to strike gold - err, opal - can get people really excited. Some say that the best feeling in the world is seeing a glint of that  stone, getting out your hand tools, and digging in anticipation, hoping that this'll be the day you get rich. People also say that using dynamite is some of the best fun you'll have. Though recently, they made it so that you had to have a background check before getting a dynamite licence, which got some people annoyed.

Speaking of which, there's a lot of interesting characters here. Many people come here with an eventful past, and moving to this town lets them start afresh. Though it says that officially there's 2 000 people here, there's actually about 3 000. One of the census collector people were even chased out of someone's house with a shovel. Some people don't really like all these official records about them.

Quite a few films have been shot here. There's this one about aliens (I forgot the name), and they let us keep the spaceship, which is pretty cool.

Everyone around here knows each other. They say that ""If someone farts in the main street, you'd hear about it"". Whenever there's a death in town, the whole atmosphere feels down. But us Coober Pedians have a pretty good sense of humour. There's this one bloke who knew his number would be up soon, so he went and got a huge loan from the bank in Adelaide (something like 20 grand), and had a big party. Instead of a grave stone, he has a beer keg, and whenever someone visits his grave, they add a beer bottle to the collection. On the flip side, whenever there's a birth in town, everyone celebrates.

Half of the buildings here are underground. The main reason is so that people can escape the heat. I myself live in a normal house on land. Mum always said ""if we're supposed to live underground, we'd be born rabbits"". We're not actually allowed to mine in the town, so another advantage to getting an underground home is the possibility of finding opal while digging the house out. That's why my friend's house has six bedrooms, even though they're only a family of four. People also like to dig out swimming pools that never get finished, and just seem to get bigger and bigger.

Anyway, if you have any questions, ask away!

I commented on a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/zgclg/by_request_i_was_a_stripper_ive_danced_in_shitty/) where I mentioned I had quite a large crush on a dancer. After reading everyone's comments, I promised I would go for it and provide followup. So, here we are. I apologize for the writing this hurriedly. Juggling several things at once right now. None of which are my genitalia.


Now, I realize that my story is in no way unique, so feel free to share your own ""how to ask out a stripper."" In my case, this girl was just amazing. Smoking hot body, fun to talk to, and a beautiful face (even with the lights on). She kept dropping what I hoped were hints, but what my brain told me was business.


I finally went in to see her again this week. She saw me from across the room, left the guy she was sitting with, and squeezed in beside me. I told her I was only going to stay for a few minutes and wasn't going to get a lap dance this time. She told me she didn't care, she just wanted to sit with me anyway.


We just started chatting about normal stuff, like two normal people. As I'm still trying to figure out how to ask her, a moment of quietness develops. During this moment of personal contemplation, she blurts out, ""So, are you finally going to give me your number tonight or what?""
After some laughing and honest discussion about how we both felt, I left the club. She texted me as soon as she got off that night. I now have open invitation to sexy time with her whenever our quite conflicting schedules allow.


Best advice I received: They are just like your average girl, just working a unique job.

I'll go ahead and give some details if this thread gains enough interest I'll be more than happy to post more.

Freshman year of college, my ex and I were studying in a library study room around 8:00PM when she gets a phone call. It's her mother on the other line and she starts **screaming** at her hard. It was so loud, and apparently loud enough to make people stop in their steps when crossing the hallway next to us. After 10 minutes of this the phone conversation ends. She looks up to me and I asked what just happened. 

She responds with her parents being upset (confirmed) that I'm in a relationship with her. I ask her ""why would they be this upset?"". She then goes on to tell me that she was in an arranged marriage for over 5 years and the family whose son was suppose to marry her called it off because of me.

Edit #1: This was my first serious relationship, she is half Hawaiian and South Korean and for the first 2 months of our relationship never bothered to tell me that she was in an arranged marriage because she was afraid I wouldn't want to be with her.

Anyway, [this] (http://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/1gq5aa/iama_19_year_old_guy_whose_life_has_been_crippled/) is the original post. Today is day 2  of indefinite antibiotic treatment, and I have already made some strides. My depression is gone, and I don't really feel like at any minute I'm going to die. The OCD part has barely made progress. But it takes at least a month for that to even start to chip. The treatment, if the antibiotics fail, is $30,000, and way too many people, mostly kids, suffer from this disease and can't afford to do shit about it. Most people get treated within the first year, I went 9 years no treatment and in that time frame destroyed, decimated, and self destructed my life. My doctor's words were ""The fact you went that long, with no medication, is truly incredible"". I think it was too.

 I am forming a foundation with my father, and the fact I even survived this shit is proof enough I have to do something to help.  I am working on a film about the past 9 years. It's in it's infant stages though.

Proof: http://imgur.com/YwHMBDC The top part says ""battery, simple""

So here's what happened: My friends and I decided that maybe it would be a cool idea to start playing Pathfinder (a version of Dungeons and Dragons), something we'd only been thinking about for a while. I decided today to buy the rule book to start creating my character. So, I, alone, go to my local board games shop, buy the game and some dice, and I wait in the bus station for a bus that's 10 minutes away.

Then, out of nowhere comes this guy, sort of my height, obviously in his 30's. He comes up to me, while I'm holding a bunch of stuff in both hands, and whacks me right in the left temple. That first shot really shocked me, and I didn't know what was going on. He does it again, in the same area, before I realize that he wants to fight. I hadn't been paying attention to the fact that the only people who were around were middle-aged women who couldn't possibly fight this guy. I drop my stuff, he punches me again in the head, and I give him one back. I start screaming for help, but this guy is just really throwing the punches to my head (with great accuracy), and I have to back up because I'm not really in the mood to fight. All the while, I'm screaming out ""WHY?!"" to get some sense into this fool. That obviously wasn't going to work.

He keeps hitting me in the head as I throw out maximum 2 more shots. Unfortunately, I back up into, I don't know what it's called, a mini-garden? I trip on the surrounding fence, and fall onto the soil and plants below. I can't get up as this guy is just whacking away. He notices, and I notice, that my cries for help weren't in vain, and some more people started crowding around whilst the women who were there first had called 911. He fled the scene.

What was really shocking was that he never made a grab for anything that I had. He never told me to give him money, or anything else. He just wanted to fight. He also didn't look like he was on drugs.

So the cops come in within 2 minutes, as the onlookers tried to help me and asked me if I knew the guy. I had never known him, nor did I do anything wrong to him. I had never seen the guy in my life. I was just at the bus stop waiting for my bus. So the cops come, ask the onlookers and I for his characteristics, and they FOUND HIM. They found him within 8 minutes of us giving them the info, and I was ecstatic. They gave me ice for my now swollen head, told me to go to court to testify, and gave me a free trip home. The Chicago cops are actually a really nice bunch.
So that's my story. Please people, the streets really ARE dangerous in Chicago! AMA!"	t5_2sxwp	True

1374910463.0	1j5fp8	IAmA white female who spent almost my entire childhood homeless. I slept in parks, under freeway overpasses and on train tracks. AMA	Paramagic84	61	12	57	"I’m new to reddit so please excuse my lack of experience here.

First off, I mention my race/ethnicity because I was recently erroneously called out as a privileged white person who knows nothing about hardship or poverty and “should stick to subjects I know about.” This occurred during an online discussion about the Zimmerman case (of all things) and it really bothered me that people think I have never experienced hardship because I am “white” when, in fact, I have most likely faced more hardship than many. So lately I’ve been considering writing some sort of book or autobiography and figured reddit would be a good way for me to figure out what people would like to know.

I never knew or met my father so it was always just me and my mom. I was homeless from the time I was 6 until I was about 17. We slept in parks with other homeless people, under freeway overpasses, beside train tracks and in random laundry rooms. We eventually moved up to shelters, motels, and random drug dealer’s houses (at 7 years old I was an expert on methamphetamine). On many occasions I took care of myself while my mom was in jail because of her drug addiction. I can’t count the number of times I was awaken by SWAT teams, with guns drawn, breaking down the front door of wherever we were staying. We got most of our food from so-called “soup kitchens” and by stealing it from grocery stores. Despite all of this, I managed to make it all the way through school and graduated high school. I went to 7 different elementary schools in the same county because we moved around so much and our only transportation was bikes and public buses. To this day, I still financially support my mom.

I’m just under 30 years old and have spent 6 years in the Army with a tour to Iraq. I worked as an EMT in some of the dirtiest and poorest parts of Los Angeles and I am now a paramedic. I guess I consider myself to be successful considering the circumstances, but I can’t help but wonder how much I could have accomplished had my childhood been somewhat normal. Oh well, my point is that everyone has the opportunity to make something of their life regardless of their upbringings. There is obviously much more to this but I’m trying to keep it somewhat short. If you have any questions please AMA.

I’m definitely not looking for pity or crying about my sad life. I’m simply sharing my story.

Edit: Well, it's time for me to get some sleep. Thanks for all the questions. Feel free to ask more...I'll be checking this again tomorrow. 

Edit: Wow...Thank you all for the kind words and legitimate questions!!! I'm slowly working on answering everyone so hang in there.

no proof, because there are so many veterans on reddit proof doesn't matter anyway. we can spot a faker from a mile away. i'm drinking old crow and coke tonight, and i'll keep answering questions until i pass out.

i joined the army as a liberal kid more than 5 years after 9/11. i joined as a medic because i wanted to spend more time in initial training, but like a lot of 68w guys, the extra 4 months that AIT (job training) gives you before deployment didn't do much to prepare me. soon after i was given an infantry platoon and sent overseas. my infantry platoon respected me as a medic but also thought i was a pussy. after i proved myself to the platoon i was able to attempt to do their job and my job at the same time. i never killed anyone or fired my rifle at anyone. my platoon was really...i mean really...good, so i never felt like i was in real danger. needless to say i had a pretty uncommon experience.

my platoon was responsible for finding people that our intelligence pegged as troublemakers. we rode ground and air vehicles to private residences, searched them, interviewed people, gathered evidence, and left. the rest of the time i was sitting around a fob, avoiding anyone outside my platoon, working out, and trying to find booze. never found anything i didn't steal from an officer.

i had some traumatic experiences that i don't want to get into, but i'll answer anything else with brutal honesty. politics is boring, but i'll try my best if you're general enough. ya'll american taxpayers deserve it. and, i'm drunk so what the hell?

like a lot of veterans, i'm writing my experiences down so after i forget/die there will still be a record of what i did. writing about this stuff is pretty hard without some sort of guidance, and the one friend i have that i'd share my writing with has a girlfriend now and doesn't have time to discuss this stuff. like a lot of casualiamas, this one is mainly for my benefit. ask away. hopefully i don't pass out."	t5_2sxwp	True

Note: I'm moving the IAmA over to the /r/CasualIAmA subreddit since a mod informed me that this kind of IAmA is not appropriate for /r/IAmA. Sorry for the inconvenience!

For a year now I've been wasting much of my day reading and posting on Reddit. Every so often I will get a question about my username and what it means. So in celebration of my cake day I've decided to do an AMA and give out some Reddit Gold. At the end of my cake day I will award a month of Reddit Gold to the first person who can PM me with the actual meaning behind my username. I have extra Reddit Gold too so I can give some to others who guess correctly as well. (Remember to PM me with your guess so no one else can just run with your answer.) If too many people guess correctly I will draw names at random. I will also give out Reddit Gold to any other posts in this thread that appeal to me. It might be funny, intriguing, witty, or it might be nothing but a big fat effort at bribery. Oh yeah, at the end of the day I will also post the meaning behind my username.

So with that out of the way. AMA!

Edit: As for verification, I assume that posting to IAmA from this account would be sufficient.

Edit 2: IAmAWhaleSexologist correctly deduced that it is from a hash (see his thread for more explanation if you don't know what a hash is). So now the only question is what word is being hashed. Figure that out and you're home free!

Edit 3: Here is an online hash calculator: http://www.fileformat.info/tool/hash.htm If you type in the word ""test"" you can see that it will generate an SHA-1 (the algorithm used for my username) of: a94a8fe5ccb19ba61c4c0873d391e987982fbbd3  http://www.fileformat.info/tool/hash.htm?text=test Part of the usefulness of a hash is scrambling the contents up so much that you can't tell what the original text was. In fact if you just change the input text from ""test"" to ""Test"" by capitalizing the first letter, the hash comes out to 640ab2bae07bedc4c163f679a746f7ab7fb5d1fa instead which is nowhere near the hash for the all lower case input text. If you have a guess as to what word my username is a hash of then you can just run it through that page and check to see if the first 20 characters match up.

Edit 4: **WE HAVE A WINNER!!!** Congrats to user ""vaporism"" for solving the mystery! One month of Reddit Gold delivered for being the first. Still more available if anyone else can figure it out.

Edit 5: **ANOTHER WINNER!!!** As stated in the thread below, user ""IAmAWhaleSexologist"" also cracked the hash. One month of Reddit Gold delivered for that answer too!"	t5_2sxwp	True
1339030359.0	uoyck	"[NSFW] I'm a regular visitor of german brothels, called ""sauna clubs"" where semi-naked men and naked prostitutes hang out in a spa-like club."	online3782	62	13	28	"I'm obv. male, 29 years old, german, recently finished studying and having a pretty well paid job now. 

I had some experiences with prostitutes before, but the sex in there is a different thing. They're really hot women, which are at least porn star material in many cases.

Some random information to get things going, i can elaborate further on whatever you're interested in.

* Entry fee is about 30€. 
* You get french kissing, blowing without a condom, licking and sex (with condom obv.) for 50€ for 30 minutes. 
* One time i paid 30€ more to blow my load on a girls beautiful belly 
* Once paid 50€ more to cum in her mouth
* I recently had sex with two chicks at once. No lesbo show but i had a very very very good time
* The girls shower, clean their pussy with a special shower and brush their teeth after AND before every client.
* I usually go there every 2 weeks, having sex 2-3 times in about 5 hours of being there
* theres a bar, chillout room, whirlpool, sauna, outdoor pool area, ..., tv's with sports events everywhere
* with the entry fee you also get free drinks (non-alcoholic) and rather shitty food
* There is a darker porn cinema room where you can watch porn, drink, smoke and have a girl blowing you before you go up in one of the rooms.

Ask me anything you want and how stuff works in there. In my opinion, discussions about why men go to hookers are pretty boring and all has been said. I don't see it like the replacement for love, i see it as amazing entertainment. 

Me and a very big percentage of men worldwide could never ever get the kind of women that are available in those clubs. I have a big thing for supermodel type figures and had sex a few times with a very tall and crazy slim girl with a 10/10 body and a 8/10 face. I could never ever get her in real life. First, because girls like her are very rare and second because she's wayyyyyyy to hot for me. Also, if i'm there, i see her naked and if i want her, i can have a thing that feels like a super quick and spontaneous one night stand with her happening in the next 10 minutes. And if she wasn't a hooker, she would not be as good at giving lap dances, blowing or riding you like in a crazy porn movie. All this makes it a crazy service, but i know what's missing compared to real love and it's not like i don't want those things. But it's very good entertainment like eating out or getting a massage.

But after having sex with a lot of pretty girls and very beautiful bodies, i soon realized that an amazing body is not everything and sometimes not important at all. 

Could elaborate on this further but i have to leave for 20 minutes. Ask me anything, i will answer every question.

1375835988.0	1jumhf	Iama 28 yr old female who was in Foster care from the age of 5 months, to 17 years. I survived, AMA	HappyAsEver	63	17	49	"I have never before shared the details of my pre adult life in full. Perhaps in part to the sadness or pity it might invoke in individuals. I am doing so now because I believe this is an objective platform in which to share my experiences and answer questions of those who may be curious. I am aware that my experiences have been aberrant but I still feel that there is a paucity of loving Foster Homes available. Regardless of the means in which we travelled through childhood, I feel we ultimately decide our paths in life. We can choose to walk beneath the shadow of our tribulations, or we can choose to transcend the limitations of our upbringing despite them.

It would not be feasible to relate the events of one’s life within a single post on a forum, so I will relay several events that impacted me the most. Firstly, I was removed from my mentally ill mother when I was 5 months old and placed into Foster Care. My mother suffered from Schizophrenia and Acute Personality Disorder. She remained a precarious part of my life up until my pubescent years, when she passed away. I moved out into the big wide world when I was 17, having spent the entirety of my childhood in 76 Foster Homes, 8 Group Homes and 3 modern day Orphanages.

The variance of neglect, abuse and cruelty from one home to the next was substantial. I lived several months with a woman who I will refer to as Fay. I was approximately 5 years old, and had just been separated from my brother and sister for the fourth time. Upon my first visitation to Fay’s home, I remember supressing a bubble of excitement as she poured me a cup of hot cocoa with a pinch of chili powder. At this point in my life, I had already suffered beatings which resulted in several fractures and a handful of molestation incidents. I remember harboring a rather distinct distrust of adults. Yet, this elegant woman became more and more beautiful to me as I sipped my hot cocoa; until the final sip which was abhorrent and bitter. A symbolism which was lost on me at such a young age. Within my first week living with Fay our happy façade had disintegrated. I removed the batteries from the remote control in an effort to fix my broken doll. Upon Fay’s discovery of this minor theft, I was placed within the broom closet under lock and key for three months. I was given a flash light with the very same batteries I had pilfered, along with a child versioned Bible. I was allowed weekly respites from my confinement, in which I would aid Fay in disposing of and disinfecting my excrement which built up day to day. Once the batteries died, I read by the anemic light emanating from the crack at the bottom of the door.

After three months of placement in a new Foster Home, a case Social Worker will make a pre-emptive unannounced visit, in order to assess the integration of the child in question. When I was presented to my Social Worker by Fay upon such a visit, I had extreme photofobia, pressure point sores, muscle atrophy, and ammonia skin burns from where I was forced to sit in my own excrement. I underwent several months of hospitalization, and as a result was promptly removed from Fay’s loving care.

Following my recovery, I was reunited with my siblings and placed with a family who had two children of their own, as well as three other foster children. Their son was 6 years my senior, and molested me and the other foster children throughout the entirety of my year long stay. The abuse took many different forms, but one occurrence in particular always stood out to me during recollections. We would be sitting side by side in the family van after an excursion and he would require me to squeeze his penis after he would squeeze my thigh. Subsequently he would assail me with malignant comments; “You are disgusting”, “What a little whore”, “You are filthy”. This activity would reoccur as though a nightmare on a perpetual loop. It utterly destroyed my self-worth as a child. Thankfully, one of my teachers took note of my capricious demeanour. After an interrogation by my Social Worker a perfunctory removal from that home ensued.

The three of us were then placed with a wealthy and highly religious couple. We participated in church and Sunday school each week. The father figure was an enormous man, who inspired great fear in me despite his ever-ready smile. This man was at the apex of my abuse. I would be strung up naked in his cold stark basement, and whipped relentlessly. At 7 yrs of age, I would be forced to run the expansive property carrying weights, while I would be assaulted by a barrage of thrown stones. Late at night, on returning from community activities with the Church, I would be expelled from the car and made to run alongside as we made our way home. The upstairs bathroom was situated in close proximity to the winding staircase, and the father figure was adamant that I remained within my bedroom at night, for fear I would tumble down the stairs. Ironic, considering he gifted me with a multitude of broken bones via his fists. Never the less, a little rebel at heart, I would continue to use the bathroom when necessary at night. This behaviour warranted an arrangement of “booby traps”. Some of which were innocent in nature; a set of keys attached to a trip wire, in an attempt to induce a raucous alarm. I was not fooled, and simply stepped over the trigger. As a result, these traps would intensify. The culmination was a large strip of cardboard with hundreds of thumb tacks pushed through, creating a carpet of needles. As I unwittingly stepped upon it, it extracted a painful cry from my lips. The father figure’s monstrous form charged out of his bedroom, throwing me down on the thumb tacks and beat me till I lost consciousness. Unfortunately this event did not result in my extraction from this home. It did result in another closet bound imprisonment, albeit a much larger closet, during the night time hours though.

I was later removed from this home when my older sister was beaten after she tried to decorate my closet with toys, books, and a cardboard box overturned to act as a night table.

As a result of my childhood, I still exhibit scars. I have extreme claustrophobia and a fear of confinement and closets. I also experience constant nightmares, most of which involve me returning to Foster Care as an adult against my will, or finding myself locked inside closets again.

I have retained the ability to forge ever lasting relationships, I still trust and love and feel reverent happiness. As a result of my abuse, I have cultivated a massive scope of empathy as well. The stereotypical proverb “What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger” is tangible in my life. I am a successful, contributing member of society and have overcome my pre- adult years.

So about six years ago, some friends and I started working on a little space based sci-fi game called Miriani, based off a similar style of game that we had all played for varying degrees of time called Star Conquest. It was shut down at the time, and although it's been revived now, we've gone our own way and there's almost nothing in the two games that are comparable. Like our inspiration, we started our work with a type of MUD called MOO (it stands for MUD, Object Oriented).

As it turns out, our little game gained quite a following among the blind and visually impaired. This was a huge surprise to us, because the game we all had our origins in had an almost negligible blind population, so we had to adapt in some fairly interesting ways! Based on the statistics we keep, we estimate that about 80% of our active playerbase is blind or visually impaired. We've also had several players with other disabilities - I can recall one man who had the use of only a few fingers on one hand. We host about 220 unique players per week, with peak hours seeing 60-75 concurrent players.

We opened to the public on October 26th, 2006. It's been a pretty crazy six years, but we've had a whole lot of fun doing it. Especially when a banned player gets it in his head that he can ""take us down"" and tries a pathetic little DDoS or tries to ""hack"" us."	t5_2sxwp	True

1341531068.0	w3o32	I'm a paranoid schizophrenic who's been in the mental institution 3 times. I always get tossed in with the violent guys. I have tons of stories AMA	Goodguyscumbag	54	8	49	"I just wanted to let everyone know what it's like in there so I'm going to share some stories, AMA whatever you want.

First time I went in, a gay old man tried to rape me. I kicked his ass, and to add insult to injury, he got strapped to a table in the quiet room.

There was some lady who was the most agressive person I've ever met. She would come up with reasons to scream at the staff and started an arguement with me because I was leaving before she was (I had been in for 3 weeks, her 3 days) needless to say she wasn't very rational.

My last stay has the best stories.

One was an old man, we were eating in the cafeteria and it was so quiet and dull you could hear a pin drop. Without warning he throws his food tray clear across the room and then sits there like nothing happened. The next day he decided to piss in the corner of the lobby, forgot he was pissing, and started walking around the lobby with his dick out, while pissing. For some reason I was the only one laughing.

The best for last, there was a 19 year old kid in there who thought he was a gangster. He would constantly be in fistfights with the orderlys. Eventually he decided he had enough to being stapped to a table every time he swung and not landing any hits. So he started walking up to orderlys completely calm and punching them in the face with absolutely no warning what so ever.

1374816186.0	1j2wjl	I'm a 17 year old girl without any reproductive system besides 1 ovary. AMA	imnotkimjongil	64	19	90	"I was diagnosed with something called [MRKH syndrome, or Müllerian agenesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCllerian_agenesis) in December, after dozens of doctor visits and ultrasounds since April to figure out why I didn't have a period. It took so long to get an answer because MRKH is rather rare, not many doctors know about it or knew why they were seeing ""nothing"" in any of the ultrasounds. Due to MRKH, my uterus never fully developed. I had surgery in March to take out the two uterus fragments and remove the Fallopian tubes, if they hadn't taken out the fragments, I would've died if an egg ever implanted in one of the uterus pieces. I have to drive an hour away for doctors appointments, and have a panel of 8 doctors.

Due to my condition, I get a lot of ovarian cysts because my body doesn't always reabsorb the eggs that are released off my ovaries right away. In June, a 6 cm inch formed on my left ovary and was hemorrhaging. Due to how painful it was (3 ER visits), my doctor scheduled a labrascopy surgery to remove it last Tuesday. During surgery, the discovered the cyst was so heavy it caused my left ovary to completely twist around 5 times, cutting off the blood supply and explaining how bad it had hurt. They removed it, so now I only have one ovary!


AMA concerning MRKH, how it has affected me, anything :)


Edit: For anyone interested, [here's a picture of the ovary before they removed it.](http://imgur.com/HiqRuz8) The thing to the left of it is the cyst and the thing connected is what's left of my Fallopian tube, but it was filled with blood.

AMA	giraffifer	53	8	52	"As the title states, in case you are wondering, though I do not typically use nor enjoy the term, 'stealth' is a term used in the transexual community to describe a transexual individual who goes unnoticed by society around them. 

I am not normally one for advocacy, its my personal opinion that everyone is going to make their own decisions and I'm not out to save the World, but a recent conversation at work enlightened me to the impact an AMA might bring out; especially in allowing honest, open questions. 

To set the stage here, I currently live within the state of Indianapolis and work for a mid sized marketing firm as an intern. We handle many things and my tasks are primarily filing budget forms and occasionally picking up odds and ends that are missed due to our execs traveling or taking 'working vacations.' While I typically enjoy my coworkers and I cannot say anyone does not work hard, I recently was part of a meeting that really unsettled me, leading to this AMA. 

My goal is to educate and put some assumptions to rest, and, perhaps even reinforce that some are actually correct. In our meeting, our new client has had candid conversations with our higher ups and while I was sitting in on a meeting today, as we dismissed out the door back to the main lobby area to see the client out, they were discussing the client's son, who's roommate had apparently been relocated and the client was laughing and said 'The boy apparently thinks hes a lady....crazy kids these days.... Im telling you its all this technology, its tearing the family unit apart.... Oh well, Mr. _____ and Ms. Giraffifer, you two enjoy your afternoon.' 

Typically this kinda thing does not bug me, but I often feel it odd how many people meet me, and say such things, not aware I am standing in front of them who have faced a similar ordeal. 

So Reddit, let's have at it, I'll be here for at least the next 2 hours answering as many ?s as I can. :)


EDIT
This was moved to placate the sensitive sensibilities who have seemed to believe I posted incorrectly. However, as I felt it was going in a good direction and saw even a few people I might be able to help, so I figured we'd try this again. AMA


EDIT 2: Had to go and sleep/work.  Just got back.  I'll be hanging around in case this has any steam.  Thought it'd get more of a 'bite' but I guess when this stuff is banished to casualiama, its not exactly shocking.

My mom who originally decends from Hungary, EU, has her parents in hungary. So we had no other choice but to go to hungary due to my mom having no job (she was a housewife). We couldnt go back to the US because all the family and friends that live there have connections with my dad, so we couldnt ask them to help us out. So here i am, in Europe. I am extremely homesick and i really want to go back to the US. Ive been abroad for nearly 3 years now, and its torture. I swear to you that there wasnt a day since i left the US that i did not think about Murica, my home. Im also failing school due to the Hungarian language. The only thing that is financially supporting me is my grandparents' retirement money and my moms salary (she gets 500 dollars per month). So essentially Im living in poverty in a foreign country! The economy in this European country is bad. I am extremely determined to go back soon. My mom wants to go back too, but she is afraid that we are going to end up in the street. I know this is an AMA, but you guys can also suggest what my mom and I can do. Dont forget to ask questions tho because i am curious what you guys are going to ask :D.

what are the top three things you dislike about Egypt?


[–]0wnage[S] 1 point 7 minutes ago
1) The lack of freedom due to the strict religion. I dont want to be offensive, but living in an Islamic country is horrific when you are part of the society (not a tourist).
2) Society.
3) The atmosphere.

[–]johnfrench03 1 point 56 minutes ago
Was your dad mean ? how did he force you ? why didnt you run before , better yet why didnt you call the police if you really wanted to get back im pretty sure you can classify it under kidnapping.


[–]0wnage[S] 1 point 9 minutes ago
When I was in the states i hardly knew my dad, he was either working, or doing something else. He was never with me. And i know you may think ""well thats sad"", but believe it or not I enjoyed when he wasnt at home because when he came home he was always yelling constantly, he never was in a good mood. He always argued about everything. When we moved to Egypt he became 10 times worse. He was 10 times as strict, 10 times more angry for some reason, and he was more violent. I feared him so much, after i ran the fear slowly turned into hatred. I couldnt run from my own dad, besides, before i went to egypt i never really realized what my dad was getting me into. My mom did however, but as i stated before, she was a housewife. If she fought back, then he wouldve filed for divorce. He wouldve won for sure because my dad was the one who had the job. So that meant my mom only had 2 choices: stay in the US and abandon hrt kids or go with hrt kids to Egypt. Officially it wasnt kidnapping.

How's Hungarian food?


[–]0wnage[S] 1 point 16 minutes ago
Its pretty good. The only Con about hungarian foods is that 80% of hungarian foods are either soups or some wierd ass stew.

What is so bad about Hungary? Why not wait until you are 18 and take some pressure off your Mom?


[–]0wnage[S] 1 point 22 minutes ago
Its not the country, its me not belonging in this country. You will never know the feeling until you actually abandon your homeland and live in a foreign country for years. Essentially i dont belong in Hungarian society. Of course going to a foreign country is a good experience, but actually living there for a long period of time can really impact your social life, etc. And after what Ive been thru, my social live was pretty much destroyed by that point. Homesickness believe it or not can really damage your personality.

What was your dad's reason for forcing you all to move...?


[–]0wnage[S] 1 point 17 minutes ago
Its pretty obvious. My dad wanted me to pick up Islamic culture and pick up Islam itself. I never realized what Islam really was until I moved to Egypt. I was in huge culture shock, I was forced to pray, forced to learn the Quran. To this date, my biggest fear is, believe it or not, Islam. I know Islam may not be as bad as i state it is, but for me, what they made me do was extreme. This is why to this date I am an athiest and i dont want to have anything to do with religion.

Edit - 

I may also have Aspergers (the marriage counselor insists I do..), which may account for some things..

Update - 

Night three (post divorce decision).  I moved some stuff out of the bedroom and took over the living room and couch.  Since I don't know anyone else up here (aside from work acquaintances), I created an account on Plenty of Fish and OkCupid.  I messaged pretty much everybody, and found a few people to talk to.  

My wife did as well, and might have a date tomorrow night (while I'm at work) with someone, and has exchanged numbers with another guy.  She's also back in contact with all the prior guys (including emotional affair guy), and via chatlogs I saw the nice reunion conversation they had.  

She talked about how hurt she was that he told her he ""doesn't want to talk to her ever again"" - that her ""heart hurt"" because of his comments and how much he really hurt her.  They agreed they could only be friends (what does that mean..?),  and she asked if he thought about her during the break, etc etc etc.  

He asked how counseling was going, and she said she's going to stop (the counselor is seeing her independently to work on low self esteem issues), because the marriage ""is now void,"" and that all she talks about ""is the emotional affair,"" - followed by a roll eye smiley face.  

Earlier tonight she was crying, and came out to the couch and tried to hug/cuddle.  I tried not to cuddle back (I'm weak for cuddle..), then told her to go.  She offered to allow me to sleep in the bed with her, but I said no.  

So that's tonight.  I feel incredibly lonely, I'm sad that the person I thought was my best friend - isn't, and won't be.  

I cried for about a minute earlier, but a part of me doesn't understand why I feel lonely/sad, and I feel like we're just playing roles.  Emotional events usually don't hit me too hard, and I get over most things very quickly.  I also don't think I've ever been truly mad or in a rage..usually just hurt or annoyed.     

Also a girl on POF called me a ""creep"" because I (jokingly..) messaged her with ""We're going to be married someday, just letting you know.."" which I thought was hilarious, but apparently not.      

Edit - also saw her pleading on facebook with the guy who was ""hot"" to take her out.  "	t5_2sxwp	True

I am an ovo-lacto vege, but do not eat fish, as they are animals.

My mother assures me that if we should decide to start eating meat, she would accept our choices, but the idea has never occurred to me. I simply don't see the need for meat, and don't want to kill when it's unnecessary. The way i see it, we no longer need meat to survive. It's no longer for sustenance, it's for pleasure, and I don't kill for pleasure. I don't begrudge a lion his gazelle because he needs it to survive, and were I stranded in the woods or on an island, I would hunt, because it then becomes a matter of survival. The distinction i think is clear. We are creatures of reason, so we should require reason to kill.
Having never eaten meat, there is no temptation with which i have to struggle, which is great. I am, however, looking forward to lab-grown meat, which i would eat without a thought, as nothing died or suffered for it to be made.

I was born in 1986 to a happily married couple. My father was an avid motocrosser and hunter. My mother, a beautiful homebody. Thing was, this little world was going to be shattered. My mother was diagnosed with an aggressive form of bone cancer, and passed away when I was 6 month old. My dad found another woman and ended up having 3 more kids. But we will get to that.

My stepmother from day 1 seemed to have hated me. She ignored me, and treated me like the shit. My youngest memories are of me cleaning and trying to cook for my younger siblings while she was away spreading her legs. The abuse got worse the older I got. some of the punishments were:
~smacked with a frying pan upside the head if dishes weren't done
~Thrown down the stairs if dinner wasn't on the table
~Punched in the face if any of my siblings said I did something
~Locked in my room for up to 3 days at a time.

That's to name a few. I didn't have toys growing up. I had a single stuffed bunny (which I still have), a dresser with 3 shirts, 2 pants, no underwear and no socks. My dad was at work so often that he had no idea. Everyday it was the same. Even going to school I was picked on and abused. I was the freak and the different one. I had maybe 1 or 2 friends throughout school days. 

For years it was the same thing. Wake up, get beat and screamed at, go to school, beat and yelling, rinse repeat. When I hit grade 6, I started cutting. I finally had enough and packed a bag. Left for the streets. It had to be better right?

I spent the next couple years drifting from shelters to houses to bridges and benches. Smoking anything put in front of me, pills, and nose candy. I started having sex at 13 years old. First ever was with females. Males when I was 15. By that time, I just wanted to die. I didn't care. I was smoking upwards of a quarter ounce of meth a day, PCP for breakfast, Mushrooms for lunch, coke and pills for dinner. I was told several times I wouldn't make it to 19. 

One day I was arrested and thrown in jail. I was given a pregnancy test at 15 years old, turned positive and thrown in jail for the next 4 months. I sat down and cried for days. Knowing this kid was going to be fucked. Turned out I was 4 months pregnant. I was released on good behavior and sat in the downtown core. Wondering if i was going to have this kid. If it even was viable. I finally went back to my dads place and he let me stay. 

I ended up having my daughter on Aug 2nd 2002 at noon. I decided to keep her. Good news, there wasn't a single trace of anything in her bloodstream. She is a very healthy 10 year old now. 

After I had my daughter, my stepfather decided he would molest me and throw me 20 bucks for diapers, or cop a feel just to laugh. This kept up until my dad beat him senseless. Step mother got thrown out after she was caught spreading her legs, and telling my siblings that she would need to bleach the bathtub case I was a dirty whore. 

Oh, she also defrauded my name on 3 credit cards and sent me into $80,000 in debt before I was 18. 

I am now almost 27, have a home, a hubby, my child, am a Chef and own my own business. 

I apologize for this story being all over the place. I seen some horrific things, did horrific things, and still suffer from the effects of the drugs. I've never written about it all, only spoke of it.

It's 3:02AM and I am returning from a trip to the local 24hr everything store with a copy of Starcraft 2 - League was down for patching, I had work in five hours or so, and my internet connection was too slow to download the major content update that just went out for GuildWars 2. At any rate, I had always wanted to play Starcraft 2.

The seasons first significant snowfall still coated the countryside from the night previous, and the near full moon tried to keet everything well lit while the moody cloud cover diffused the light in to a pale wash on the fallen snow.

I knew something was up as I had left my driveway for the store. At the top of my switchbacked driveway lay before me a meandering route through mountainous nether to civilization. And there, at the top of my driveway, lo a big motherfucking moose. It ran in front of me for a while, as moose often do, and then veered off and wheedled with her offspring up the side of a fucking mountain like no big deal.

On my way back up that very same mountain, ever victorious in my acquisition of Starcraft 2, I encountered **danger**! The baby moose, the cute little humpbacked baby moose, came bursting out of the bush in front of my vehicle! I slowed to a crawl but that little douchedrinker daisy-stepped directly along my route of travel to the foot of my driveway.

My switchbacked driveway.

My steep, sketchy as all hell, switchbacked driveway. 

I didn't know where the momma moose was, but I knew if I kept close to this little baby I was in a world of hurt. The momma moose was bigger than my Ford Explorer. Holy hell that's a big moose.

The baby breaks back in to the bush on the other side of the road, and out of my rearview mirror, I see the momma moose - the majestic, galloping, bum rushing, motherbitch of a moose heading straight for me!

I gunned my car, expertly navigated my snow-covered death-way, and perfectly parked in my dirt area of parking.

*But it wasn't over*.

Momma moose followed me. Cautiously, of course, but she followed. She was angry. I had scared her, I had gotten in between her and her baby.

I thought I was safe, I didn't see her. I exited my car with my loot, my copy of Starcraft 2, and inhaled the deepest breath of the coldest air I had filled my lungs with in a long while.

Then I saw her. She looked at me, almost quizzically, before shuffling her hoof and snorting. That cow had another baby, and it was not a foot on the other side of me.

Needless to say, I ran like a motherfucker, zigzagged, hardcore parkour'd some stacked logs, and did a barrel roll. I lived, but barely. I looked back at where the moosecow had started her charge, and that whore was standing in almost exactly the same place - as if taunting me, trying to make me think that she had never charged in the first place.

On one side there's the folks (generally non-Faroese) who are 100% against whaling, and on the other side (and this side constitutes a large portion of my whole country) are the people who are 100% for whaling. 

Basically I'm kind of stuck in the middle. I don't participate in the hunts anymore and I rarely eat the meat. So. AMA! 

**TL;DR: Live in a country where people hunt whales as part of our culture. Most people are very extreme when it comes to their opinions, to the point of being fanatic.**

I realize it's twisted and fucked up. I loathe myself for it, I go to therapy/counseling, and it's something I have to live with.

I'm a normal guy, college graduate, good looking, decent job, in great shape, have had a number of normal relationships with women, but there is that little twisted part of me deep down. 

I'm not sure exactly how it started, I was abused physically pretty good by my parents, and an older sibling mutually JO'd with me a few times. I now know that was not a good situation.

I don't put myself in situations where I would be exposed to younger girls or be around them, I don't hungrily stare at them; I'm not in any danger of suddenly buying a van and going out rape killing. I would put a shotgun in my mouth and pull the trigger if I ever remotely considered acting on this shit. I have never sought out kiddie porn and never will. 

But deep down, there is this attraction. It's terrible. I think people who touch kids should be put down like animals, and yet I have the same sickness in my head. 

I can't tell anyone who knows me about this, I will be seen as a twisted monster. Any questions?

AMA (NSFW)	XYGirl	42	4	60	"Hello, I'm a 19 year old female born with Partial Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome. I've seen other AMA's from people with the same condition at /r/AMA, but they seemed to be from people with the Complete version of my condition, and I also saw that there wasn't one on this subreddit. 

In a nutshell, I was conceived with an XY chromosome and was supposed to develop as a boy, but my mother's chromosomes were not responsive to Androgen (male sex hormones), hence the name, so even though I have the genes of a boy, I developed physically as a female... well, mostly anyway. I developed testes where my ovaries should've been, and I have no uterus, only a vagina. 

If you have *Complete* AIS, which I think is a little more common, your physical traits are completely female, meaning you have a complete vagina and look completely female. You're also incapable of growing body hair, which I think is kind of cool. But unfortunately, I was born with a slight case of Partial AIS, which is a little different. Here's a [diagram](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Quigley_scale_for_androgen_insensitivity_syndrome.jpg) (WARNING: NSFW obviously) showing the differences in genitalia in Complete AIS and Partial AIS- 6/7 being a completely normal set of junk for a normal female, which someone with Complete AIS will have. I was born with a 5, so my clits a tiny bit bigger and my vag is a little smaller than normal. It's kind of a bitch. 

Anyways, when I was 10 I had my testes surgically removed and I started hormone therapy, which gave me a decent pair of tits. My face is completely feminine (at least I think so) but I am taller than normal (6 feet, and taller than both of my parents). I can't get my period (no uterus, duh), and unlike people with Complete AIS, I still grow body hair like a normal person.

I have been raped by five different people throughout my life. Those times were not consensual. Most recently I narrowly avoided being gang raped by three strangers. Please keep in mind I do not intentionally put myself in situations to be raped. When engaging in rape roleplay it is discussed completely what is okay and what is off limits. 

I lost my virginity to a rapist and feel as though this has influenced my sexual tastes. I am very much a BDSM enthusiast and identify as a switch; my favourite roleplay is rape/abduction.

I'm not sure what else to put here but I am an open book, ask me anything, nothing is sacred.


EDIT:
Guys, don't ask me why I've been raped so many times. That's victim blaming and it makes you a douchebag. Like I said above, I never intentionally put myself in dangerous situations in the hopes of being raped; that every rape roleplay is discussed and planned with everyone to be as safe as possible.

AMAA	fromrussiawithwow	46	12	58	"   I t all started when i was 13 with a random call on my landline phone. The guy told me he was from my school and asked me if wanted to go out with him, which I said i didn't. He told me his name and grade, and there was a popular guy in his grade with the same name, so I might have been somewhat playful/flirty but still it was a ""no"". From that moment on, i started noticing this creepy kid two years older than me following me around saying nothing, he just appeared in front of my lecture hall every recess. I kinda let it go for a while, because i was used to mens' attenton and figured he'd back off when he realizes he had no chance.

   It was this way for a couple of months, then he starts sending me flowers to my home adress, than i found little presents in the pockets of my coat (which i always left in the cloack room). I really started to feel the creepy vibe, but everybody who can noice that thinks it is  cute/hilarious.

  Then the worst part came: he started following me home. I walked home from school and he just followed me silently i tried to shout at him to fuck off and stuff but he just smiled and I was to terrified to do something serious and he sensed my fear and felt more confident. 

  It was like that for years, I finished school and went to the university, it was exactly the same way, every day. Of course i minimized the amount of going out, whenever I tried to go to a club or the like, he was always there. I never wore short skirts or any kind of revealing clothing so not to provoke him. I told my mother (she is asinle parent), she couldn't do a thing. I asked some people I know at local police to scare him off, it only worked for a month, then he appeared again. This whole experince fucked me up a lot, especially the way I behave with men. It only changed 2 years ago when I was finally able to move to another city. I think I am better now but still recovering, I didn't get any therapy or eerythng, it doesn't hurt to talk about that, I just feel very helpless sometimes about things.

1348608407.0	10gzr2	I underwent sedation (sleep) dentistry, overcoming crippling dental anxiety. AMA.	somnodentata	42	8	23	"I'm sharing my story in hopes of helping anyone in a similar situation. My story is non-graphic, but if you are like me, just reading about this will make your lip curl, your skin crawl, your hands shake. I know how you feel, because that was me. I will even avoid the d-word; instead I will call it the d, and him Dr. D.

If you have not been in a while, please read my story. It is about me but written for you.

**Background**

I had bad childhood experiences, and as a result I have a mistrust of d's, coupled with a lot of issues around teeth in general. I can't look closely at teeth, or x-rays, or anything. The thought of visiting the d fills me with so much anxiety, I can't even sit still. I was not afraid of the d, like I am afraid of a wasp; I hated the d, I hated the thought, I hated everything to do with teeth, I did not trust them, I hated them. And so I did not go, for more than a decade.

My smile looked fine, but eventually my back teeth started hurting bad enough that I could no longer deny that I needed work done.

**Meeting the D**

I did some research and found a d that specialized in anxious patients and sedation.  I called them up and made an appointment. My hands shook on the phone. ""When was your last visit?"" they asked. I cringed as I told them. But they had heard it before.

My first appointment with Dr. D was only to take x-rays, and look at my teeth with a small mirror. Nothing too bad, but still, my nails dug into my skin. I hated people looking at my teeth, and I was terrified of what they might find. He looked at each tooth and said some acronym; I didn't understand what they meant but I figured they were bad, some description of awful decay. I felt sick to my stomach.

Dr. D asked me to tell him about my bad experiences. He said, he wanted to ensure he did not make the same mistakes with me. Talking about it with him helped crystallize my issues: that d's were authority figures there to judge you, that they motivated you with fear and embarrassment, that a combative relationship with your d is inevitable.

I began to believe that it did not have to be that way. Dr. D could be my ally, there to help me, not judge me, never to embarrass me. He was not an authority figure I must answer to, but a service provider I could utilize, like the pizza guy. I learned that 80% of his patients have bad anxiety, that my teeth were not the worst he's ever seen. That there were others like me.

**Sedation and Existentialism**

Dr. D told me about the sedation options: standard nitrous, a pill called triazolam (aka Halcion), and intravenous sedation with an attending anesthesiologist. I could be literally asleep, but it would be quite expensive (~$7k an hour) and risky.

I had researched Halcion. It is a hypnotic: you are technically awake but in a ""twilight state,"" like being hypnotized. I would lie down in the chair, and suddenly I would be at home, with no memory of the procedure. The Halcion sedation would cost something like $400. $400 to not have to lie in the chair for hours, the bright lights in my face, the creepy masks leering over me, the metal probes. I wanted it.

As an aside, this brought up all sorts of existential questions. If I had no memory, would I be consigning a separate me to some awful procedure? If someone offered you a million dollars to experience the worst pain imaginable, with the promise that you would not remember it, would you accept it? Isn't that just like subjecting another person to the pain? But my teeth hurt. Halcion for me.

**The Experience**

It wasn't really a pill: it was half a tablespoon of vaguely vanilla tasting powder, placed under my tongue where it dissolved. Dr. D told me to try to relax, and that he would be back in an hour. I felt the effects of the drug, a little like being drunk. But I still felt anxious. I wanted to get up and walk around. I could, right? But Dr. D told me not to, to try to relax. Was I relaxing enough? They put headphones on me with music, and I lay there and listened to it. It wasn't enough. I needed more triazolam, I was sure of it; I'm still fully awake. Guys? Would I remember this? Was my memory now detached?

Then there were dark shapes, masked faces moving above me. A few metal instruments waved in front of my face. Or was I dreaming, imagining the procedure? I closed my eyes, I was in a forest, or maybe the beach, flowers. Heard voices: open, close, turn. It was easy to do so. I felt a plastic tube on my nose. Nitrous. Were they just starting? How long had I been here? Would I remember this?

And then I saw light. Rest, relax, they told me. The hygienist came to clean; I was more awake, confused and unsure, but unconcerned. Was it over? It had only been maybe half an hour, right? My wife was here. I was wheeled out to our car in a wheelchair. My teeth didn't hurt. I could stand. I got into the car.

I was groggy for the rest of the day; next day I was at 100%. My teeth didn't hurt.

**Conclusions**

My teeth were in pretty bad shape, but salvageable: no extractions or implants. I spent five hours in the chair, where I got multiple fillings, a root canal, a crown, and a few onlays (half-crowns). I don't feel like any of that happened, and I would not believe them except that my teeth don't hurt any more, and I have the temporary crown. I'm going back in a month for a few more fillings and the permanent crown, and then next year for my wisdom teeth.

I went from horrible, crippling anxiety, to none at all. The hardest part was making the appointment, and the first visit where they looked at my teeth. I experienced zero pain during or after. While I did not ""lie down and wake up at home,"" I have only vague memories, like remembering a pleasant dream. I was there for five hours, but it felt like two.

What about my existential questions? Was there some version of me who underwent terrible pain, who thrashed and screamed, the metal instruments digging, facing his nightmares full on? No, and I know because I left myself notes on my phone:

    Hi somnodentata Doing ok don't worry
    All done No worries
    Will I forget this car ride

Creepy but reassuring messages from beyond. And my teeth don't hurt.

If you are like me, this is your path. Know that there are others like you and worse. Know that your anxiety can dissolve under your tongue, forever. Look for d's that offer triazolam. If you're in the California South Bay Area (Silicon Valley), PM me and I'll tell you mine.

**Why Write Now:**

The two mass murders in elementary schools on Friday have sparked a lot of discussions about mental health, especially schizophrenia. I'm not fully qualified to speak about this from personal experience, nor am I thrilled to have lived this, if this story can help anybody understand what they personally experience before bad stuff happens, or the social stigma against mental health in America diminishes, that will be worth it.

**Symptoms/Experiences:**

The first abnormal thing I remember was vividly hallucinating that small (but very heavy) motorcycles were driving across my face. The pain was unbearable. I was somewhere between five and seven, and my parents had just put me to bed, only to return to the room shortly later to find me screaming my head off and clutching my face. I have no idea how long this continued, but it felt like an eternity.

For as long as I can remember all sorts of little things were irrationally terrifying: places where ""darkness came from"" like drains or under the bed. Even in high school I could imagine to the point of ""feeling"" arms of darkness coming out from these places and trying to grab at my ankles.

I remember thinking that other kids didn't have very good imaginations. I remember around 11-13 if I willed something hard enough, I could watch it visually change in front of my face. I liked changing the size of my hands most. I couldn't watch horror movies.

I lived in fiction books. Funny things were always happening to Harry Potter, or other children who turned out to be magical, and so I briefly considered that maybe I was magic and the fiction books had encoded messages in them which would lead me to people just like me. It was a dark corner of my mind that I tried not to think about too much when I was feeling good, but sometimes I'd sit in my room for hours and try to puzzle it together. It was somewhat dark and compulsive behavior.

Around 15 my parents had me on a lot of drugs (long story). They were concerned I was sick (long story) and I was taking a huge number of heart drugs, anti-seizure drugs, and other crazy things. Unsurprisingly I started hallucinating a lot. This made high school more socially awkward than usual. My relationship with my parents was quite poor, and I was regularly threatened with being put in a mental institution if I talked back or behaved poorly, so I was terrified to tell them I was hallucinating.

At 18 I was disowned. As I never had been diagnosed with anything and saw no reason to take the medicines.  I told myself I was hallucinating due to the drugs, so I stopped all the drugs. I refused to take even Advil for years because I was so stubborn, more on principle than logic.

The hallucinations didn't stop. Especially under stress I would hear voices that I knew were not there, and if I covered my ears they didn't get any quieter. It is hard to describe, but it was like the sensory inputs I was getting never quite added up to a picture that made sense: like the puzzle pieces didn't lay flat on the table when all clipped together, they overlapped in weird ways where two pieces of data tried to lie in the same place. I became very good at body language so I gather more data and figure out which bits of my perceptions were incorrect so I could cut them out.

**Social:**

This became my darkest secret. I was terrified above anything else of somebody learning I was crazy, having custody being reassigned to my parents, and being back under their control. I remember mentally rolling my eyes when a friend who had recently come out of the closet was whining ""You don't know what it is like to have a secret you can never tell anybody... to believe you're completely broken and that something is deeply wrong with you.""

I finished college and worked at two reputable entities. I thought I had learned to live with it. I cultivated a reputation as an alert and childish personality so that if I turned around to look at something as if startled, nobody would notice. I convinced everybody I had phenomenal hearing, that if I jumped at something I could say I had been responding to something in visual range but out of earshot of my peers.

I told my first friend when I was 21, five years into hallucinating. He had seriously no idea what to say. We never really spoke of it again, and continued like I'd never said anything.

There were still close calls. The closest one was when eating lunch with coworkers and I heard a horrible crash, my coworker screaming ""OH MY GOD!"" and tons of chairs moving fast. My head snapped around, but my coworker was calmly eating his meat as if nothing had happened. I actually cared about this guy, so I guess my expression was a little out of hand and I remembered breathlessly asking him if he was OK. He just stared at me. I felt like the room stopped, and everybody was staring at me. I couldn't figure out any excuse for my behavior fast enough.

**Getting Help:**

I'm not sure how much was blind fear from there and how much was a bunch of really smart coworkers beginning to add things up, but for the next few weeks it felt like the world was crashing down. I felt like everybody was going to know soon, and I had to do something about it. I did enough research to figure out that if I could prove I wasn't a danger to myself or others they couldn't take away my rights as an adult, and off I went.

I'll never forget the first doctor's appointment. I hadn't been to a doctor since I was 18 (I hated them) but I'd been to Urgent Care a few times, actually at the same hospital. I was 23.

""So what are you here for today? Annual physical? STD tests?"" ""I haven't had my ADD meds in years and I'd like them please, I have a sewing needle in my foot, I have a bruise which hasn't healed in 6 months, and I hear voices that aren't there.""

The doctor took it remarkably well. She looked up my X-Rays from two years ago when they had originally found I had a sewing needle in my foot, found it, and then took me a bit more seriously. She said it was important that I go see a psychiatrist right away and she wanted to see me next week. When I came back and said I hadn't had time to find a psychiatrist she wrote me a leave of absence from work and said it was a priority now.

My psychiatrist ran a lot of tests and eventually decided it was depression. I didn't want to believe him, nothing I had read suggested this. He prescribed me anti-depressants and I went home and diligently took them.

I remember the first time I woke up and the meds were working. It wasn't my birthday and it wasn't Christmas, but I was happy to start a new day. There wasn't a good reason for it, but there it was. There's no better way I can put it, but I'll never forget that feeling as long as I live. The data which didn't fit in fell away, no more voices, no more weird things which didn't add up. Dark things don't ""weigh"" on me, sometimes I enjoy walking around in dark rooms just because I know it doesn't bother me now.

Finding the right medicine was rough and I was forced to go without a few times in the process, but once I stabilized everything was great. I've been good for almost two years now, and these have been two of the happiest years in my life. Getting treatment was one of the best decisions I have ever made in my life.

**Obligatory ""if you suspect you're crazy"" stuff I wish somebody had said to me:**

* DO NOT SELF MEDICATE. Self-medicating for say an arm is OK because you use your brain to think about your arm and consider effects. Here you're trying to use your brain to think about your brain, and your efforts can easily bias your perceptions. You need somebody you trust to catch you and tell you when you go off the deep end.
* Make a save file. If you do go off the deep end, you need a relationship with a doctor to help you get back. You are way more likely to come back if somebody knows what you're suppose to look like when you're healthy.
* You can always opt to stop taking your medicine if you really hate it. In the US, so long as you are not a harm to yourself or others, you remain legally able to make your own choices. (I am not a doctor of a lawyer. You should always double check advice you read online.) But, in my philosophy, as an adult there is little to no harm in seeing what help is out there, and there is so much to potentially gain.

Also, go check out the previous discussion that was going on before I got modded.

Let me say first that I've debated for a while whether to post this or not. I still believe in God, though not how I used to, but I have no desire to try and convince you. I honestly just want to discuss, not debate.
I see a lot of content from people who can't understand why anyone could believe in God, and I get that. I'm someone who still believes in God, yet I agree with almost everything that's posted in /r/atheism.
I'm not looking to give answers, I'm just looking to be challenged, and to possibly make others think...and to show people that not all theist/Christians (I agree with the teachings of Jesus, just not most of his followers) are uneducated bigots.
The most important thing starting out is to realize that I believe neither in the inerrancy of scripture, nor that it is God's word. Basically, I don't take the scripture as factual or as having been dictated or written by God.

This is posted here because IAMA doesn't allow for AMAs about mental disorders as they are too common.

I hope my illness is rare enough to be considered worth an AMA or a post at all, I've seen AMAs from schizos before, every few months one pops up, some of them get great recognition and are very interesting to read, some of them get downvoted rather fast and have only a few comments.

As this illness is very diffrent for every individual, I decided to make yet another schizophrenic AMA, as some of you may find it interesting.

I had a psychosis about two years ago, this psychotic episode lasted for about 2 months. In these two months I've experienced many crazy things and if you ask the right questions there is much to tell.

1372065288.0	1gyjqe	I have Selective Mutism and can't speak unless I'm doped with Antidepressants. AMA	comethrowaway_withme	47	13	31	"I'm currently on 5mg of Lexapro, tapered down from 10mg. I want to see how strong it is right now. I don't know what else to do. I feel so incapacitated when I'm bloody off it. Sorry if any of my replies happen to sound crude or agitated. I'm not trying to be :)

I've been doped on ADs for the past 10 years. Since I started primary (elementary) school, I've been unable to physically speak without antidepressants. I think there are many misconceptions that people have about SM. The biggest conception is that SM sufferers are shy/rude/snobby. This is not true, though it can be difficult to think otherwise when the person can't reply. 

I wasn't directly diagnosed with SM because it was back in 2003. The child psychiatrists were using the DSM manual released in 2000 so I was diagnosed with Anxiety Disorder. It wasn't until the DSM-5 that SM has been categorized separately as a distinct anxiety disorder.

I'm currently on a lower dosage and I'm thinking of going up again. No, I didn't tell the doctor. AMA! Let's see if I can actually reply!

**Edit**: This definitely exploded overnight. I'll try to reply to as many as I can. If I don't reply straight away it's not the SM kicking in, promise!"	t5_2sxwp	True
1371819230.0	1gsi21	IAMA kid born and raised in Saudi Arabia	TariqSendi	42	7	89	"Many of you have probably heard or read a stereotype about Saudi people. Some may be slightly true and some aren't. It all depends on how you interpret these facts or rumours. 

Let's get one thing right. Saudis aren't oil tycoons. No one is. I guess except for Saudi ARAMCO CEO. As it's the only company allowed to dig for oil in Saudi Arabia. But they can do contracts with other companies for simple stuff like transport or constructions ... Etc. And ARAMCO is owned by the Royal Family of Saud. Which means all the oil is owned by the government. However, people working in the industry tend to make more money annually but we will come to the classes later. 

Saudi Arabia is a fond of America, most think of them as the big brother. Since we fought a war together, Gulf War. We like American SUV and mostly have American tv shows on our TVs.
The two governments have much interests. Iran is our common enemy, we like money, they like oil and our Military is trained by American soldiers. Tho we do have some small individuals that tend to turn out to be the craziest person on earth but lets not remember his name. He is not worthy of being named. Plus he is dead now.

About politics in Saudi Arabia... Well a good ol' libertarian would say, ""What politics?"". It's almost impossible to talk internal political policies in Saudi Arabia, as opposers tend to be locked up in an underground prison where you will never see the sun again, which is in a translated slang called 'behind the sun'...

The government tends to struggle to force their rule over the people whether you like it or not. If not, you gonna have a bad time. Our 'homeland security' is unstoppable with arresting people that argue its polices on twitter, Facebook, or other Social Networks. Hopefully reddit is left unmonitored.

Islamic police is one of the most infamous government agency that can be noticed about Saudi Arabia, specially over the Internet. The media hardly brings the subject to the table. These people force Sharia (Islamic Constitution) on people. They are worse then JW or West Bro Church, because they can arrest people or even torture them on ""extreme cases"". Mostly they take the youth as their target as they shave their westernised hair styles or force people to change their clothes to fit the Islamic socialite. 

There are many types of people in Saudi Arabia. The good, the bad and the ugly. Most of the later are the extremes conservatives, they don't like 'new', they stick to old rules and ignore the social advancement and disrespect anyone with other opinions. These people can get away with dissing the government because they are the HOLLY MEN OF ISLAM, as if this changes anything. There are liberal people who like the idea where people can do whatever they are pleased to do and they are the rich, the famous figures or even people of media in Saudi Arabia, some of which are silent activists. 

Speaking of the rich, many of these people are the ones whom don't complain about the political issue in Saudi Arabia, because they live a heaven on earth type of life. The most interesting thing about them are their kids. The rich kids. These can get away with smuggling Jack Daniels or afghan kush into the kingdom and make parties of rich girls and boys in their own villa. They take vacations to London, Amsterdam and Miami. Yes I might consider one of them as I do enjoy that kind of luxury except that I don't like the dictatorship of my government. But I will TRY to keep my post unbiased. 

Furthermore, I would say that Saudi Arabia isn't much different than any other European country. We have all the movies on DVD releases, no movie treaters tho. And we also get fair internet speeds however it is censored, mostly of porn and political sites and posts on popular sites. We get all the video games we want and we still can go to cafés and restaurants. Yes we have Starbucks and TGI Fridays, as I said, not different. 

Popular to misbelieve women here can actually travel where  they want in Saudi Arabia. Except abroad. But that applies to most men, including me. I still have to have signed paper from my father to go to Amsterdam or London for vacations. And I am 22. But my dad signed a long term paper for me so I can leave whenever I want.

In the end I would like to conclude that the worst part of Saudi Arabia is its dictatorship and censorship. But people still can get by. 

I hope you enjoyed this small, not really, post.

That's the link to the entire thread. It's all bullshit, and on a few levels:

* First off, this is anon7715. The dude who keeps making AMAs about war vets and cancer patients. Same grammatical idiosyncrasies and he is speaking in the same vernacular. 

* Secondly, and perhaps most importantly, /u/lazeru states that the plane he crashed in was carrying 5 people. Impossible! The *max* a fighter pilot could carry would be 3 people. It's the little things like this that make the fake very blatant.

I know there have been a few trans IAMAs before but I figured I'd share my perspective as well. I'm in Toronto, Canada, and started the ball rolling on medical transition in 2003 with a therapist I was seeing at the time. I was approved for testosterone blockers at 14, and started them just afterwards at 15, which was also the first year I looked physically female (and the last year I looked physically male). I did a degree at U of T while not talking to anyone about my trans status, and got sex reassignment surgery under my provincial health insurance immediately after at age 21.

I can answer whatever you want me to about being a sociopath, what it means to be a sociopath, or just about my life/what I do in general. I can also dispel common misconceptions about sociopaths.
Not all sociopaths are the same, but many share characteristics such as late-age bed-wetting (I was about 10 before I stopped), logical approach to situations and tasks, ability to lie extremely convincingly, and etc.
I view life and the world as existing to entertain me. I am capable of emotions such as love, happiness, and anger, but it is more of a direct conscious emulation of those emotions rather than something that occurs naturally. What I feel is real, but it is only real because I make it real.
I care only about a very, very small amount of people. When I say that, I mean that I would rather they not die or leave my life because they make it more interesting. For example, my father recently left my mother and 4 younger brothers, and when I told him how disappointing he was he hinted that he was going to commit suicide, but that is something that I do not care about.
I was friends with another sociopath at one point, but he was at some different part of the spectrum, where he fantasized about kidnapping, torturing, and eating women. We were too different for me to care whether he was a part of my life or not so I cut him from it.
I'm just giving a little information that I could expand upon if asked. I do not know how to submit proof for this, but will do whatever someone else deems necessary for sufficient proof.
With everything said and done, go ahead, AMA.

Questions/Answers from r/IAmA:


**Can you spot another sociopath after interacting with them for a few hours or days?**

Yes, actually. It's quite easy to spot lower functioning sociopaths because they are much worse at hiding it (some try to hide it, others do not care). It's often based on their choice of words and the questions they ask.

**Can you elaborate on their words and questions?**

I couldn't quite explain it. They just talk differently. A lot is also in the physical queues, like shifty eyes, awkwardness in body position, what they do with their hands, etc.
Edit: Social ineptitude is also a big giveawa

**How many parts of the triangle do you fall into? Do you think that you would genuinely mourn if a close relative died?**

If by triangle you mean bed wetting/animal cruelty/starting fires, then it is just the bed wetting and fire starting. There was never a logical reason for me to be cruel to animals, I don't feel a need to exert power over something lesser because I view myself as far above many anyway. And if a close relative died, it would honestly depend who it is. While I don't dislike my family, the only deaths what would affect me would be the ones of my mother, my grandfather, or my youngest brother.

**Does accepting and acknowledging that you're a sociopath make a difference at all?**

Make a difference in what, exactly?

**I guess can you control the feelings or behavior at all?**

There isn't much that is different, it's just a fact that I know.

**Have you read the book: The Sociopath Next Door? If so, did you miss out on any details?**

I have not, though I am an avid reader and now intend to do so.

**At what age did you realize you were a sociopath? Are all of your emotions emulated? For example, have you genuinely laughed at a joke, not just because its expected that you laugh?**

I would say that roughly 90% of my emotions are emulated. When no one else is around, I have nothing inside and have nothing to show. When I do emulate my feelings, there is nothing false about them, they are real (again) because I make them real. I don't tend to find jokes funny, what I find funny are situations that involve the confusion and manipulation of ""normal"" people. I have genuinely laughed at that.
Edit: I realized I was a sociopath at about the age of 14

**Are there any manipulations you refrain from doing, because it might harm the relationship between you and that person? Not in the sense of them not liking you, but because it prevents you from more manipulations in the future?
Similar to the last question. Do you care about what people think of you in any way shape or form? Would you refrain from doing something to make people not trust you or think of you in a certain way that might have negative side effects in the future. IE, relying on pity for manipulating people might cause them to think you are whiny in the long run and you would be unable to use that in the future with that person.**

Obviously violent/threatening manipulation is something that I stay away from. And I do prefer people to like me, because when they do I can get away with a lot on their expense. I generally tailor what I do specifically to the person I'm doing it to.
I do not really care what people think of me, but again I'd prefer to be thought of positively. Your pity example is a great one, and one that I use often, but only when there are actual situations that could evoke the pity in the manipulated party. For example, my house was destroyed in consecutive floods 5 years apart, and I was able to milk that extremely well in school and with relatives. I tend to wish that bad things would happen to me so that I can use them to my advantage.

**What is your ultimate goal? Just getting people to do what you are expecting them to, to benefit you, or do you try to get money/other tangible objects?
Have you ever pushed the limits just for fun? Or do you enjoy keeping things planned out for longevity.**

My ultimate goal is entertainment. I don't view society as capable of advancement, so contributing to it would be an illogical waste for me. I decided that I want to have money, because that is the best way to have whatever you want in life. I plan to go to law school.
I have, on occasion, pushed the limits with ""friends"" who I drew close then shattered emotionally. It's never anything direct, I just know what subtle things can set a person off and I am very good at it. For the most part I keep things in an equilibrium though.

**Any good behavioral manipulation techniques that you are willing to share?
Have you ever taken MDMA? If so, what does it feel like to you?
What human organizational behavior do you find it most irritating to have to emulate?
Does it drive you nuts that all the normal people and our society at large keep making all the same bad decisions for the same emotional reasons over and over again and never learn or even have the capability to understand why they are screwing up?**

Any good behavioral manipulation techniques that you are willing to share?

Please elaborate on this, and I could answer better

Have you ever taken MDMA? If so, what does it feel like to you?

I have not, however I have done many different drugs, from marijuana to oxycontin, and do not ""get high"". All that happened after my first 40mg of oxy was a headache. I took it often just socially with a couple friends and pretended I was tripping out, but there really was nothing. Addiction to anything has never been an issue to me. I am also incapable of getting drunk.

What human organizational behavior do you find it most irritating to have to emulate?

Pointless interaction, e.g. small talk, introductions, etc. Much more can be accomplished by getting to the point.

Does it drive you nuts that all the normal people and our society at large keep making all the same bad decisions for the same emotional reasons over and over again and never learn or even have the capability to understand why they are screwing up?

It does not matter to me, I am able to understand that not everyone else is like me so they cannot really logically stop themselves.

**Anything in particular you just dont enjoy doing? Manipulating love interests for example?
Do you have any funny/horrific stories of how you completely destroyed someones day or even life?**

I have had only love interest, and she knows all about me and still loves me despite it. I rarely attempt to manipulate her unless we are fighting, but it is not something I like doing.
I had a ""friend"" who had an older brother who died of cancer when he was about 6, which sent him into a depression so deep that he was taken out of school the next year. He did not return until my freshman year of high school, where for the most part I was friendly to him, but we had a habit of making lewd and awful, extremely inappropriate jokes. We were talking (the next year) and I decided to go on and on about his brother, getting to a point where I told him that I'd like to go into his parent's room at night, tie them down, masturbate on their faces, and dump his brother's ashes on them so it sticks like glitter. He dropped out of school the next week, attempted suicide, and last I knew was in a hospital for his depression.

I was familiar with computers and knew how to use one. The only things I did were play flash/shockwave games. I eventually found some chat rooms, specifically ones with guys on webcam. I was pretty introverted, but had some good friends. I had a lot going on in my life at that time, medically and mentally speaking.  

I eventually became curious and started talking to some guys. They told me they didn't want to talk to other guys, only women. Eventually, I made an account as a female and put a picture up and started talking. They were more than happy to talk to me then. My laptop had a mic and so sometimes I would talk to them. Me being 10 years old, I sounded pretty much like a female through a laptop microphone. They would get on webcam and ... yeah.  

As time went on, I eventually got better at doing it. I became fascinated in the fact that I could talk to all these people and they would want to talk to me back. When I started high school, I had started wearing makeup to school and took purses and felt good about it. I felt like if that's what guys wanted to talk to on the web, I would be a woman in real life as well. By this time, I was going on webcam in full makeup with long hair and looked a lot like a woman. I had trained myself to sound like one as well. I don't think it was the sexual part I enjoyed, more so talking to them and making them feel better about themselves. The guys I really enjoyed talking to were the ones who looked like they were nervous, just wanted someone to talk to, etc.  

I stopped when I was 18 wearing the makeup and being like that in person. Not to divulge too many personal details, but I could never be a drag queen or anything of that nature. Only on the internet where boobs &amp; up were seen. I lost a lot of friends, thought of as a freak in high school, etc. for doing so, but I have no regrets. I still go online and do voice-only with guys sometimes. My friend actually took pics for me to use because she was fascinated when I told her. I'm now 24, in college, and perfectly happy.

- I'm very introverted (not all autistics are!), asexual, and demiromantic. My social life is about as full as I'd like it to be, and I've never actually had trouble with making friends, mostly because my drive in that area is so low that I can get away with being very picky about who I try to make friends with and only make the attempt when there's a good chance it will go well.

- I do have sensory integration issues (including some pretty significant auditory-processing trouble and an intermittent balance issue), and experience overloads and shutdowns and a few other relatively minor altered states. Also, I'm very, very synesthetic, so even when everything's running 'as normal' I'm still not functioning in quite the same way everyone else is.

- I have trouble reading body language. Oddly enough, I'm actually pretty good at reading other mammals' body language - it's just humans and some dogs that are incomprehensible to me. I can understand tone of voice just fine in any case.

- I don't have any perseverations/special interests at the moment, though I was pretty obsessed with insects when I was little. That tendency to get hyperfocused on one topic seems to have faded as I grew up, and mostly manifests now as a tendency to get really into a project for a few weeks or months to the exclusion of all else, rather than having the topic take over my life on a near-permanent basis.

- I have Opinions on the state of modern psychiatric care. You may or may not want to ask me about that. Insufficiently specific questions will probably just get a rant in response. :P"	t5_2sxwp	True
