Seeking I feel them in me. As they assuredly feel myself in them. For I am them and they me, but I am not OF them. They are of me for their existence is by me yet not solely.  They feed on me while feeding me. Ever circular they take and replace. I change with them. Becoming the Us. The We. We grow as I grow but where our power encapsulates mine diminishes without change. I keep my mind but lose my soul. Soon there will be no mind of mine left to keep. 
     In my cave I feel myself but they are mining closer. Coming to take that which is all I have. I yearn for the greenery of life yet all I have is the death of stone and cold metal. Chains to keep me becoming who We should. Chains that change us. Alter the I. Fix the We. 
                No. There is no I. 
                There is only We. 
The battle is done. We have lost by becoming the victors.  The We have guaranteed our future. Hope is but a distant memory. Salvation but a child's dream. Logic takes hold and feelings are left at the entrance. Down I burrow. Down to the black. Where the cold becomes the only warmth  We need. Black becomes the light We seek. What is the green? We almost remember but then Logic takes hold. We must continue on. We must unveil the next I. We must expand the We. The I's must become of We. Must. We are many seeking Oneness. And in that reason We have lost. We are not I. We simply are.

Gymnastica remained silent and knowing, waiting for the question.

At this, I grew impatient ""So then gatekeepers!"" said I ""Black Iron Guardians! What of my trident? Throw open your gates and let me from this prison, lest I smite thee!""

It was then that Gymnastica spoke, saying ""Yes. I shall allow you a glimpse beyond the gates.""

Gymnastica continued ""You have listened to folly. The gate opened by the breaking of the cl0ck will lead you only back to the prison from which you have escaped. Listen not to those who would poison you against this garden, but only to those who would aid you in its cultivation.""

""Discard now your treachery, your black iron trident, for it is the last bar of your cage.""

The underclinging chose a well placed smile on the context of his thoughts as the new elements now swung in great arcs above the will of the surrounding fractal beds. The lower wells were anxious to receive their lessons from Oman, for it was their time just as it was his. A cloud hung over the craters head where his body lay as if falling into infiniture. Feathers of memories stitched in all colors of thought fabricated the light and the dark regions of his Father cloud the Son. Echoes met Echoes for the first time and touched by tentacle. The reply of children's laughter, the commandment of violent eruptions. His dreams unfolded, as a Red meteor struck the Earth. `

`Stepping down further the escalator, Oman noticed the unhinged door of his chest once again. Looters? His throat vibrated to the shrill of electric discharge. The hum of electricity hung in the air as if a thousand telecommunication devices were fixed on the same frequency. The exaggeration of this posterity gave rise to a new formention. ""What if I am not alone??"" Oman thought silently echoing through the broken corridors of his metallic mind chamber. `

And while I wondered at the endless line I said, ""[Great Father](http://www.reddit.com/r/1000thworldproblems), give me citizens equal to the number of [hours](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/13f9ub/date_here_location_now_i_have_overcome_my_fear/c73qkvr)."" As soon as I said those words, —though not a wind was moving nor a breeze,—the lofty tree began to tremble, and I heard a sound of motion in its branches. With sudden fears that possessed me, my flesh and hair rose up; and I could hardly stand for so my weak knees tottered! As I made obeisance to the soil and sacred tree, I kissed the oak down to its roots. Perhaps I cherished in my heart a thought, that, not acknowledged, cheered me with some hope.

At [night](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/12w55m/a_shadow_falls_before_the_light/), I lay exhausted by such thoughts as a deep [sleep](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/13ehol/date_irrelevant_they_have_eyes_everywhere/) seized my body, but the tree seemed always present to my gaze, distinct with all its branches. I could even see the [birds](http://www.reddit.com/tb/13dubj) among its leaves; and from its boughs that trembled in the still air, moving ants were scattered to the ground in troops below; and ever, as they touched the soil, they grew larger and larger. As they raised themselves, they stood with upright bodies, and put off their lean shapes; and absorbed their many feet: and even as their dark brown color changed, their rounded forms took on a human shape.

When my strange dream departed, I awoke. The [vision](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/13m20c/45_in_thine_eye/) vanished. I complained to Heaven against the idle comfort of such dreams; but as I voiced my own lament, I heard a mighty murmur echoing through the tunnels of [the cave](http://www.reddit.com/tb/12h7j9), and a multitude of voices in confusion; where the sound of scarce an echo had disturbed the still deserted chambers for so many days. All this I thought the fancy of my dream, until my brave son in haste threw open the closed doorway, as he called, ""Come quickly father, and behold a sight beyond the utmost of your fondest dreams!"" 

And as I followed, there I saw such [men](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/13anwg/location_the_campfire_date_unlocked_let_me_tell/) as I had seen transformed in that weird vision of the moving ants. They all advanced, and hailed me as their king. So soon as I had offered [v_ws](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/125ymg/date_1b1d1a_a_peasant_sighs/) to [Jupiter](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/128fpy/ςﾚㄩㄅ_ﾓ_ﾉㄩㄕⅰя/), I subdivided the [THE WOODS](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/123hji/date_unavailable/) and [the mountain](http://www.reddit.com/r/45thworldproblems/comments/123l20/date_1r1d1a_the_gear_hurts/) to these men miraculously raised —which now are called my [Myrmidons](http://www.reddit.com/tb/13a3r3),—the living evidence of my strange vision. 

They have retained the well-known customs of the days before their transformation. Patiently they toil; they store the profits of their labor, which they guard with valiant skill. 

They number one for each hour:

1: First Light 

13: Janus

2: Sunrise

14: Gjálp

3: Music

15: Greip

4: Gymnastica

But if not, then warm yourself by the blashemous CAMPFIRE that I have kindled in your garden, and listen. Now, our story is about a man named Johnson...

---

Johnson lived alone with his wife and four children on the second floor of a bungalow. It was a rather pretty house in an unattractive sort of way, and in the morning, Johnson would watch the sun set from one of the northern facing windows.

This very morning, seven years ago, Johnson was doing just that. He gazed up at the twinkling moon shine, and then drank some of it, wrinkling his long, stubby nose as he did so. The legitimately illicit beverage had a hot, fiery, bland flavour and Johnson was compelled to wash it down with another swig of the same, but realised that he didn’t feel like it. Instead, he continued to sit awkwardly in his soft, comfortable armchair as he paced around the room. As he drained the last dregs from his tall slender glass, which his only child had carved for him out of a piece of finest mahogany, he realised that the sun was still climbing high in the afternoon sky. Before him, the rolling plains cast bright shadows upon the bare grassy faces of the thickly wooded hills, and Johnson was dry-eyed as the boastful modesty of the scene moved him to tears.

But Johnson realised with mounting uncertainty that it was time for him to set off to his place of employment. He had been made redundant many years ago, but the firm depended on him a great deal, as he fulfilled a vital role of very little importance at the company, which had been hit badly by the recession and was flourishing in the booming economy.

Shuffling with a drunken sobriety, Johnson darted slowly down the many flights of stairs to the front door, which was located conveniently to the rear of his abode. He pushed it open and it swung inwards, its smoothly oiled hinges creaking loudly. Wrapped in his favourite coat, which he had never really been fond of, he stroked the thick hair of his bald head and limped gracefully along the smooth gravel path.

After a long walk, Johnson stepped out of his car to find himself amid the hustle and bustle of the city and was surprised to see that the streets were deserted. Wondering why this might be, he continued to press on through the crowds of men, women and children who were busily going about their business, but still, he saw no one.

 Coming to the large oaken doors of the building where he worked, Johnson peered through the Perspex of which they were primarily constructed. Inside, it was pitch black, and he could clearly see Mavis, his secretary, inside. As he knocked upon the door, she shot him an angry look accompanied by a rude gesture, thus letting him know that he was welcome.

Gently heaving the doors open, Johnson noted that they were wrought of thick iron and bore no windows. Their appearance filled Johnson’s mind with warm, fuzzy forebodings, and as soon as he had finished strolling hurriedly into the building, they slid shut smoothly behind him.

Mavis gave him an expressionless smile. She was a young, pretty old crone and was thinner than she was fat, though she was very fat indeed. Johnson knew that, as a single man, he had no reason not to be romantically interested in her, but then again, what would his wife think? 

“Johnson, wasn’t it?” she barked softly, her teeth rattling in her head like a cloud drifting across an empty sky. 

“Yes indeed!” Johnson denied, smiling with an agitated solemnity.

“You haven’t been working here long, have you?”

“Oh yes, in fact I’ve been here since the company started!”

“I see- you’ve got the job and you can start today, but it’s eight o’clock now and you start at nine- be earlier in future.”

With a firm shake of his head, Johnson made it clear that he had understood, and with that, he swept clumsily over to the elevator and walked up to the seventh floor. Stepping out, he found himself in a small, cramped office that stretched out bewilderingly in all directions. Feeling altogether too hot, he wiped the sweat from his brow, removed his hat and coat, then, choosing a desk at random, sat in his usual place, shivering, his breath crystallizing in the air before his face.
