ThisGuyPhill	120	9	36	"My GF and I took a trip to Cleveland this weekend for a wedding and late last week I asked reddit for some places we should visit. Friday night we decided to hit the town and ended up walking down Euclid, Prospect and Huron. Your suggestions were spot on, unfortunately we couldn't visit every place mentioned due to time constraints. 

We started off with an appetizer and drinks at the Hard Rock (we wanted to feel like tourists). From there we checked out Euclid and ended up walking down the alley with Pickwick &amp; Frolic - their breads and spreads appetizer was awesome. We explored a little bit more until we decided to call it a night. 

Cleveland is home to the nicest people in the world. We asked for directions and suggestions a few times and everyone was more than happy to help us. We couldn't believe it. We often visit Columbus, Dayton and Cincinnati (they're closer to home) and Cleveland's citizens beat all of these other city's hands down. We had originally expected Cleveland to be a lot like Detroit, we were so wrong. 

And the best part, traffic was great even though when arrived just before the Indians game. 

I want to thank you guys for a great night! It was awesome, we'll definitely be back. "	t5_2qkh0	True
1334535393.0	sbjmh	Today, /r/Cleveland redditors demonstrated their love for the city and cleaned up Edgewater Park.	cblaz	119	9	35	"####Great Success####

Redditors of [/r/Cleveland](/r/Cleveland), I'm proud do say that we've pulled off the most successful [/r/Cleveland](/r/Cleveland) meetup to date. 17 of us joined forces and demonstrated our love for the city we call home by cleaning up Edgewater Park. Over the course of 3.5 hours we dug through sand and scaled rocks to fill **24** trash bags full of garbage. Lazyphreak even delivered on the pierogies. Afterwords, we enjoyed pizza, burgers and cold brews at Johnny Malloy's in Lakewood.  Thank you to everyone that brought out supplies and to everyone else who came out!

[Here's the pictures.](http://jordanenders.smugmug.com/Other/Gallery/22466003_HsbPw7#!i=1796145602&amp;k=BvBBgwV) 

####Moving Forward####
If we were able to clean such a large area in only 3.5 hours with 17 people, can you imagine would we could do with 35 people and a smaller area? I would love to do an event/project every month or so and continue to grow Cleanup Cleveland, but I can't do it alone. 

What do you think? Do you have ideas for another event/project? Are you interested in being a part of planning upcoming events?

This morning, people were walking around in the neighborhood with big smiles on their faces. There was a definite sense of relief and joy.

I posted about a week ago saying that my girlfriend and I were planning on visiting earlier this week, and we were seeking things to do.  
You redditors really came through and gave us many options, and asked that we give an update when we got back. I wanted to not only fill you guys in on our impressions, but say thanks to all of you for your suggestions.  

Firstly, your city knows how to eat. We were only there for 3 days, but we were able to hit a few amazing restaurants: Melt, Mama Santa's in Little Italy, and another place for dessert (the name escapes me). All three were some of the best food I have ever had.  We also hit the Great Lakes Brewing Company and West Side Market... brought back far too much Ohio beer and cheese.

Secondly, I had no idea the arts scene was so vibrant. Both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the Cleveland Museum of Art were fun and extensive. We probably spent about 4 hours at each, and it wasn't nearly enough time.

Lastly, we both can't say enough about the people. Coming from a similar, working-class city in Canada, we had some predispositions of the people we would encounter.. but we had no problems, and interacted with some of the nicest, most helpful people we've met. I really felt like they were going out of their way to make our time in Cleveland the best experience possible.    
 
Anyway, just wanted to say thanks to both the Reddit community, and the city of Cleveland. We'll definitely be recommending a visit to all our friends, and hope to be back soon!

We had a great time.  As suggested, we ate at Aladdins, which was amazing.  We went to the West Side Market for two lunches, because my kid said that once was not enough to try things.  Brought back some great bread home for Easter too.  We also went to the Sweet Moses.

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame was perfect for a music obsessed 13 year old, and also for a nostalgic 46  year old.  Also enjoyed the zoo, walking around downtown and around the art museum, and just the cool architecture in the city.  Most beautiful public library I've ever seen (yes, the geek boy is into stuff like that).  Really liked the Rain Forest at the zoo. Oh, and we went to Big Fun, and had, well, big fun.

Thanks for all the pointers.  I love it that I can poll locals for ideas, and we saw a lot we'd have never thought of without you all."	t5_2qkh0	True

As a loyal patron of their venue, I think its worth sharing here.	cblaz	74	7	20	"I don't receive karma for this, nor am I in anyway affiliated. I just want to see the Cleveland music scene flourish. 

""Dear Beachlanders… 

We want to make a plea to you about buying tickets early… Much like the big Bon Jovi show that just got cancelled at the stadium, we have been precariously close to having several shows consider cancelling or postponing due to lack of advance ticket sales. In some cases we had to plead with the artists and agents not to cancel even when the shows ended up doing reasonably well with last minute ticket buys and walk-ups. We are being called daily by booking agencies asking for ticket counts on their shows. And we are constantly being compared with Columbus where advance tickets are generally much better. Agents really want to see some energy when a significant show goes on sale and if Cleveland is not giving it they consider routing the band in a different direction next time. So, we understand that many people have financial cycles they need to stick to or you may not know if you have to work a certain night. But if you are sure you are going to come to a Beachland show, please go on line or click through on this newsletter; call us at the office 216-383-1124 Monday-Friday 11-6 and order tickets; or go to one our outlets around the region (Music Saves, Square Records, Heights Guitar, Stebal Drums, Loop and Visible Voice). This will give us and the booking agents a better idea of Cleveland’s energy for a specific artist and actually help us relax a little as we sit here counting tickets and worrying about whether we are going to be able to cover a high guarantee. Advance ticket sales also help us with planning staffing and room set up. We know you can rarely be sure in the concert business. But Cleveland is a challenging market at all levels of this business and it is only ticket sales and music product sales that will show the national music community that we are still a strong music town.

Thanks Cindy and Mark"""	t5_2qkh0	True

We are trying to organize a ""resistance"" in response to this. Help."	Craptacular_Idea	81	10	33	"We have just over 24 hours to organize our efforts to support the Parmertor family as they face a protest by the Westboro Baptist Church (WBC) at their son, Daniel's funeral this Saturday at 9AM. This group is for attendees to organize and communicate with each other. If you have any services to offer, please post them here, wether that be the ability to give rides, tarps or sheets or anything to block protesters out, if you think it will help, bring it up here and lets make it happen. Here's the place to share and come together. Please reserve this group for people already confirmed to attend to stay focused on planning alone. Unfortunately, a few of the other Event pages have so many people logged in that focus isn't there, and we simply do not have enough time for that. Some pieces of this information was taken from those event pages to save time.

Goal:

To PEACEFULLY assemble at St. Mary's, where the funeral will be held, to block the WBC and their hateful protests from the family while they mourn the loss of their son and prepare to bury him. We want to form a human chain between WBC and the church itself and drown their hateful protest with loving song.

HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT: 1. PEACEFULLY. This is NOT a protest. This is an assembly. We are not here to show our dislike for the Westboro Baptist Church. We are not here to assault the Westboro Baptist Church. We are not here to voice our opinions on members of the Westboro Baptist Church. We are here to do everything we legally can to help the Parmertor family grieve properly, BURY THEIR SON and not have a horrible day made even worse by a group of extremists.

2. LEGALLY. I can guarantee you that some form of law enforcement will be at this funeral. You will be playing into the Westboro Baptist Church's desires if you assault any member of this organization. A lawsuit is their wet dream.

3. In a perfect world, here is how I imagine Saturday going. The Westboro Baptist Church never show's up. If that happens, our goal is complete. The Parmertor family never had to be subjected to this tasteless display. However, if they do appear, I want us to surround the front of Saint Mary's Church. We link arms, and DO NOT LET THEM PASS.

4. We will be distributing a lyric sheet to as many as we can, containing the lyrics to 3 songs. ""All You Need is Love"", ""Lean on Me"", and ""This Little Light of Mine"". Along with the human chain, this will be our form of protest. The goal is to render their hate pointless because it is being drowned out by these simple yet strong songs.

5. When family and friends are entering and exiting the church, the goal is to block the view of the WBC from the church via tarps, blankets, sheets whatever we can elevate to block their sight. The combination of our song and these ""curtains"", the family will be able to focus exclusively on laying their son to rest.

WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT: 1. Rain. Bring an umbrella. 2. Expect to be called a homosexual slur over 1,000 times. 3. Spit. Lots of it. 4. Shoving and other physical contact from their part. 5. A strong police presence. 6. Media. (Don't be an asshole) 7. People inciting us to use physical violence. (Stay focused) 8. Tears. Lots of them. 9. The Parmertor family being honored as best as possible. Count on that.

*****IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE STAY AT LEAST 300 FEET AWAY FROM THE CHURCH AND DO NOT ATTEMPT TO INTERACT WITH THE FAMILY. THIS IS STATE LAW AND WILL BE ENFORCED.******


EDIT: The address of the church is St Mary's Catholic School Chardon, 401 North Street



EDIT x2: Mainly the idea of WBC picketing this funeral is that our public schools are teaching violence and sin to our children, and that this was ""God's way of cleansing the sinners"". Essentially I feel this is to be hateful in the hopes someone will act out towards the WBC members. There hasn't been official confirmation that these people will be here, however a few members did show at one of the other students funeral yesterday, so their presence is to be expected. Ideally, they don't show, but we are preparing just in the event they do.

The signal is loud and clear all around Cleveland and I consistently get full stereo where most stations I get are mono. Their music selection is top notch and ads and morning DJ talk is minimal and way more interesting than your typical gossipy morning show. They have cool interludes with random Cleveland stars like Cleveland Browns players, they do a great job of differentiating themselves from other radio stations. A lot of college radio stations are great, but it's nice to have a unique radio station with high production values. So if you haven't gotten around to it, check it out!

For a while now we have been thinking of ways to get Clevelanders together where people could be themselves and share interests like comics gaming and the like with one another, so we started GeekCLE, a not for profit organization that promotes geek culture in Cleveland. 

Our site has weekly articles, a way to find local comic shops, game shops, arcades or new friendly places in the Greater Cleveland area, and a continually updated calendar of local events. Our main focus is the GeekCLE Weekly which is all about events happening each week.

We have a variety of our own events that allow poeple to meet like-minded locals. Our events as cheap as possible if not free.

In addition to our events, we've been teaming up with other local businesses and organizations to come up with new ways to bring people together and are interested in meeting people that want to get involved.

If you're interested in joining us for our next event .   [Show and Tell]( http://geekcle.com/events/geekcle-show-and-tell-2/) is on Friday at 7:30 at The Bottle House in Cleveland Heights. The idea of this is to bring something you like and share it with others. Meet people and make new friends!

In addition to that we have a [Craft Event](http://geekcle.com/events/geekcle-craft-event-perler-bead/) coming up 4pm, Saturday August 10th at Salty not Sweet in Ohio City. Come make things with Perler beads! 

We are also starting a [Book Club](http://geekcle.com/events/geekcle-book-club-i-wear-the-black-hat/). The first title we'll be reading is Chuck Klosterman's ""I Wear the Black Hat"" The discussion will be held on 7pm Friday, August 30 at Rotten Meat Gallery in Cleveland.

You can find all of this on the site www.geekcle.com and on our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/GeekCLE) "	t5_2qkh0	True

Not any more.

Everyone knows the problems in this city are tremendous, but we all kind of fall into this lull of thinking that putting up a new restaurant in Tremont will save it, somehow. 

Conversely, the solid majority of people of this city can be convinced that building another motherfucking stadium/casino/what have you (funded by the taxpayers of course) is the answer and/or solution to this city's problems. Then we're told it will draw 7 hundred trillion people per minute and create 65 quadrillion dollars of tax revenue and employ 900 quintillion people. And every single time, Clevelanders buy this bullshit hook, line, and sinker. I'm sorry, but that bullshit line that it contributes to the area economy is nonsense. If that were true, this city would have millions of people in the city proper. We have 3 beautiful (again, fully funded by taxpayers) stadiums, and nothing to show for it in terms of population movement.

I guarantee you that NO ONE has moved to this city because of the Browns stadium, or the casino. And again, don't put on the blinders and say ""well, people come for Tremont"". Doesn't happen. At least, not in a sustainable way that will dig Cleveland out of this mess.

When I think of moving out of this city, I don't think of moving to any other city and say to myself ""Gosh, hopefully they have a magnificent sports stadium!"". Things like this do not make for a livable city that people want to come to and raise families and become productive within. The tragedy of Cleveland is that it has become a corporate wonderland. I challenge you to drive 10 minutes in any direction, in any part of town and not come across the same 10 stores. It's disgusting to me.

So here's my question to you, Cleveland: What can we do to really save this city and attract people to it? While it's exciting that some small pockets of the city are growing and becoming hip, the vast majority of this city is dying and or dead. 

We have to be real and we have to look at ourselves good and hard in the mirror and make an honest assessment of where to go from here."	t5_2qkh0	True

I'm from Dayton.  I came to Cleveland for a summer internship, and to be honest, I didn't expect much out of this city.  I guess it has gotten a very Detroit-esque reputation where I'm from, and my friends all told me I would hate it here.

BUT, good news!  I absolutely love it!  This city is really great.  There are good and bad parts of any place, but in my experience, Cleveland is beautiful and fun.  Lurking around in this subreddit has opened me up to some awesome experiences.

Unfortunately, the time has come to leave.  I just wanted to thank you all for being incredibly welcoming, and let you know that I'll spread the word back home about how much I loved it here!"	t5_2qkh0	True

As we discover new local places to eat, shop and have fun, we'll be chronicling our journey there. As of right now, we're only writing about local businesses. We believe in our local economy an want to support it in the best way we know how. 

We're determined to bring Clevelanders a high quality information and plan on posting at least two new articles a week. So if you enjoy reading what we have say, check back frequently or subscribe via RSS feed.

If you're adventurous and love writing, we'll be looking for writers in the future to help. Or, if you have suggestions of somewhere to review, [let us know](http://discoveringcleveland.com/contact/).

I didn't hear one honk during my 20 minute trip to downtown from Lakewood. People often waved at other people when they let them in. There were a minimal number of people just blowing past everyone and switching at the last second. Considering it was early in the morning, some people's commute to work was doubled, and people know that for the next two weeks they're going to have to do this everyday, most people were still pleasant and helped things move along better than they could have if everyone were acting in self interest.

1332168000.0	r3hc5	Anyone interested in having a meetup to help clean up Cleveland?	cblaz	58	4	46	"#### A little background ####

While at visiting Edgewater park last week, I got out of the car and was overwhelmed with the amount of garbage and trash laying around everywhere. At first, I wasn't really bothered until I started walking towards the pier and noticed car license plates that were from Canada or Michigan. This made me think, what impression are these people getting of our city? If I were them and I saw how disgusting that park was, I'd turn around and never come back. For the first time, I was embarrassed for Cleveland.

#### Let's clean it up #####

I'm proposing that we band together to help clean up the city we call home and show Cleveland what we can do - starting with Edgewater. I realize that whomever runs Edgewater will have the place cleaned up in due time, but that's not the only place in the city that's been overrun with trash and garbage, just pick somewhere. 

#### How we'll do it #####

Simply put: power in numbers. The more people we have show up to help, the more recognition we'll receive and the faster the job will get done, which means less work for everyone. A few people bring trash bags, a few people bring gloves, that's all the supplies we'll need. If we get 20-30 people there, we could sweep over the entire shoreline in an hour. 

What do you think r/Cleveland?

---------------------------------

**Edit:** The tentative plans will be:

Sunday April 15th @ 11am. Garbage cleanup followed by BBQ, frisbee, fishing, whatever. I'll create a Facebook event soon and post the link. Nearly a month out will get us around Easter, into warmer weather, and plenty of time to spread the word.

What we need to coordinate:

* Who can bring trash bags?
* Who can bring gloves?
* Who can bring hand sanitizer?
* Where can we dump the trash bags after we fill them up?
* Who wants to bring food? i.e. Hot dogs, burgers, vegan varieties, chips, pop, water, etc.

---------------------------------

**Edit 2:** I'm currently working on coordinating the event with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR). Once I've got everything worked out with them, I'll make the plans official. To help pay for supplies, I plan on sponsoring the event with my businesses. If anyone else owns a business and would like to sponsor the event, please comment or message me. More information to come, stay tuned!


---------------------------------

**Edit 3:** I'm working on finalizing all the plans now, look for the official event posting next Monday the 26th!"	t5_2qkh0	True

In Cleveland we understand corrupt government. They swear to uphold the Constitution, but they only do when it serves their purposes. Do you want those people keeping tabs on you and your family? If you are left, right, green, tea, or moderate this affects you. The important thing is a removal of the Patriot Act.

Story and tips inside...	joeycat84	54	9	14	"So myself and a few friends (six of us total) decided to check out the Greater Cleveland Aquarium that opened last week in the Flats District. Since I am a Stonebridge resident we walked to the powerhouse and I was shocked at how many times we were asked where the Aquarium was at by people who we not familiar with the flats. Then, I was even more shocked (and pleased) at how big the line was when we approached, it was wrapped outside the door and down the sidewalk at around 2:00pm on a Saturday. The line moved fairly quickly and it was nice out so we didn't mind. When we got to the door they were handing out little laminated slips, ours read: ""Your entry time is: 5:00 p.m."". So we had about 2 1/2 hours to kill before we could be admitted. I can imagine this would cause some problems for people driving from far away with small children. The staff did inform us we could leave with our slips and come back just before 5 to be admitted. We ended up having a few drinks at McCarthy's then getting some appetizers and drinks at Shooter's to kill the time. The line was much shorter when we arrived back at 4:45, and it only took us about 10 minutes to pay and get into the aquarium. 

The aquarium itself was very cool. There is a very nice mix of modern looking tanks along with the historic power house structure. Honestly I was not expecting it to be as big or diverse as it was. The lighting in there is very, very low, so make sure you look around before you move to a new section (one of my friends completely missed the tunnel through the shark tank because he didn't see it!). The shark tank was still pretty cloudy but the visibility was still ok, the sharks were definitely not shy! There was also a pretty cool petting tank that was staffed by 4-5 kids in wet suits. The crowd was mostly mature adults and young children, but there was still a good amount of teenagers and young adults checking it out too. All in all I think it was a great experience and well worth the $22 ticket!

For you out of towners: Make sure you check your map before you get lost driving around in the Flats. The aquarium is in the Power House, the building that looks like an old power plant. The entrance into the Power House parking lot is at Elm and Winslow, there is also another parking lot entrance off Main st. If you come during peak hours, be prepared to have to burn some time. Some suggestions in walking distance: McCarthy's Downtown, Harbor Inn Cafe, Shooters on the Water, Flat Iron Cafe (if they ever open the Center Street bridge again...), Carney's Top of the Flats...

TL/DR:
Look at a map so you don't get lost driving around the Flats. Buy your tickets online to skip the line. Be prepared to hang out in the Flats for an hour or two if you come during peak hours. Bring your camera! Good time for all ages!"	t5_2qkh0	True

In case you're not familiar, 17 redditors joined forces in April and demonstrated their love for the city we call home by cleaning up Edgewater Park. Over the course of 3.5 hours we dug through sand and scaled rocks to fill 24 trash bags full of garbage. In fact, we did so well that Congressman Dennis Kucinich sent us a letter thanking us for our efforts. [Here's the pictures from the event.](http://jordanenders.smugmug.com/Other/Gallery/22466003_HsbPw7#!i=1796145602&amp;k=BvBBgwV) 

This time, I'm planning on going back to Edgewater and I'm hopeful that we can double our turn out. I figure that the park will need a solid cleaning again after summer has passed. 

####The Tentative Details####

When: Sunday, September 30th @ 11am

Where: Edgewater Park, upper pavilion (if it's available) 

What you should bring: Friends and gloves. I'll bring trash bags.

We'll cookout afterwards again. I'll create a Facebook and Google+ event after the date is confirmed. Does anyone see any issues with this date? 

####Spread the Word####

Lots of people ask me how they can get involved with Cleanup Cleveland and I welcome all the help that I can get. The answer is: I need help spreading the word. Plannning it is easy, getting helping hands there is the hard part. Once we get a date set, tell your family friends, co-workers, tweet it (#CleanupCLE), Facebook it, Google+ it, write it on the bathroom walls at XYZ, get as many people involved as you can.

If you'd like to get more involved or have ideas for spreading the word, send me a PM.

"	cblaz	49	1	28	"I know I'm a few days late on releasing the final information on this, but I think it was worth the wait. My fiance has been busy designing and developing the [Cleanup Cleveland website](http://cleanupcleveland.org) and we didn't want to release the information without the site available for RSVP. So here we go:

-------------------------------------

**When:** Sunday, April 15th @ 11am

**Where:** Edgewater Park in Cleveland, lower pavilion near the beach 

**What:** Garbage cleanup followed by a BBQ, frisbee, fishing and family fun in the park. Music to be provided by MCSound DJ.

**We Need:** Trash bags, gloves, hand sanitizer, food to grill (hamburgers, hotdogs, buns, etc.), chips, drinks, plates, and napkins. If you can't bring anything, that's okay too!

**RSVP:**	By April 12 using the form on the website. Just so we'll know how much supplies to get.

------------------------------------

I'm hoping that we can get a lot of poeple down to Edgewater on the 15th, so I've taken the time to make the event as legitimate as possible. I'm calling the event ""Cleanup Cleveland"", as it fits our goal and rolls off the tongue pretty nicely.  I've got a [Facebook fan page](https://www.facebook.com/CleanupCleveland) created just in case it goes really well and we want to do again. I've also created a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/#!/CleanupCLE) to help spread the word. 

A little bit about the event: First of all, per [ephemeron0's suggestion](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cleveland/comments/r3hc5/anyone_interested_in_having_a_meetup_to_help/c42mkz9), I contacted the ODNR and the event's been approved (just a bit of paperwork to do). I'm taking [veruus's fantastic advice](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cleveland/comments/r3hc5/anyone_interested_in_having_a_meetup_to_help/c42lxfn) and plan on doing some BBQ (~~I still need a volunteer chef~~). I don't want to rely on people to bring all the supplies we'll need so I'm sponsoring the event with my DJing business, MCSound DJ. The business will be donating gloves, trash bags, drinks, burgers, hot dogs, water, etc. If anyone else owns a business and wants to sponsor the event, please contact me. I setup the website so non-redditors can get the information as easily as possible. Most importantly, there's an RSVP form to fill out if you and others plan on coming. This way I know how much supplies I'll need to buy in advance.

Lastly, all you need to do is come, have a good time, and spread the word via any means possible. Feedback is appreciated, I hope you guys are excited as I am.

I was walking to the home opener from Tremont, and apparently it slipped through a hole in my pocket along the Abbey Ave. bridge. I didn't notice until I got to the game, and was about to get in line to buy a hot dog and a couple of beers. I texted my old man at home, asked him if maybe I had left it there. He responded in the negative. I was considering trying to cancel the cards I had information for, but decided to wait until after I got home because of a) terrible reception in the stadium, and b) it could have been at home, still.

Just about midway through the game, I got a call saying someone had dropped it off. Being the cynic I am, I hopped online, logged into my mobile accounts, lo and behold, not a dime had been spent, and when I got home, all cards were present and accounted for. I wouldn't even have been mad if you had taken one of my cards to the gas station and threw some gas in your car, or bought a snack or something. It would be well worth the headache of cancelling cards and having to go get a new driver's license.

Sometime during the night someone had stolen all four of her tires and left the car on milk crates. The police told us that this was the 3rd Honda Fit in the area to have its tires stolen. I am guessing it has something to do with the size and weight of the Fit? Anyway, this is a psa for anyone who owns a Honda Fit in the Ohio City/Detroit Shoreway area.

**Starting pay for the entry level data entry/order processing positions is in the range of $12-$15/hr**, and vary depending on department and responsibilities. Overtime for some of these positions is offered on a consistent basis and is occasionally mandatory. A college degree isn't required, but it's preferred. The faster you type, the better. There's a good chance you'll end up on a night shift (5PM - 1AM), but once you're well established, it's conceivable you could move to days.
The Customer Service positions require computer literacy (Windows 7) and phone experience -- that's about all I know at this point. Hourly pay is likely a bit higher than the data entry job.


Per our website, we're hiring IT database administrators and application developers -- that said, this job fair is focused on order entry and customer service.


**As far as I know, all positions available are full-time. 40 hrs/week, with full healthcare/dental benefits, 401k, and paid time off available.**

* We have one of the best defensive infields in baseball with Kotchman, Asdrubal, and Hannahan.
* We have the best Bullpen in baseball. Vinnie is a top 3 setup-man and Perez is on fire so far this year (14 straight saves after blowing opening day)
* We have reliable starting pitching. Masterson can be an Ace and Lowe is a consistent 3rd guy.
* Our lineup is good enough to consistently score runs. It's not great, but it gets the job done.

We're not going to run away with this thing. Detroit is a very good team. Verlander can out pitch Masterson and they have a better lineup, but we have a better overall team. We have better overall starting pitching, better defense, and a better bullpen. Last year we only had a better bullpen.

I know, ""Its the same as every year!"". This year is completely different. We were *hot* last year. We played great ball and won a ton of games early. This year, *we're not even playing well* and we're still 6 games over .500!

It's going to be a battle between us and Detroit all year, so it's important we support them during those series! We have two series against the Tigers in the next two weeks and we are currently 1-0 agianst them this year. Next game is Tonight at 7:00. Thursday's game is at 12:05 and it's Masterson vs. Verlander! The next series is June 5-7th (in Detroit).

I started a new account for this post for privacy reasons. For several months I have been looking around the area for depression/anxiety/mood disorder support groups that cater toward young people but have yet to find anything that seems to do so. I am a 25 year old male in Cleveland Heights who was diagnosed with depression at 18 and chronic anxiety earlier last year. Both my therapist and psychiatrist don't know of any specific groups for young people either and most of the places I've researched are usually for older people, vary widely in age and/or are commonly run through churches (Not that there's anything wrong with this. It's just not for me). So I thought why not try to start one? The group would follow the same procedures as any support group in regards to confidentiality and respecting one's privacy. I want it to be a place you can go where you'll feel comfortable and safe to speak what is on your mind without the fear of ridicule or judgement. This would not be an alternative to therapy or medication, just a group of similar aged and similar minded people getting together to hang out and talk, be it at a park, coffee shop, someone's backyard, you get the idea. The environment would be loose and relaxed. I am really excited to see what kind of response this generates, if any. Feel free to message me if you don't want to post in the comments. I hope to hear from you!

I moved here semi-recently and while I've made some friends, I have yet to establish the ""drinking friends"" group I had in my home state. I'm basically looking for people to relax and have beers with, hopefully involving music, discussions, video games, etc. Typical things I'm interested in include music (playing, listening), politics, video games, philosophy, Browns football, etc. I'm a bit of a jack of all trades when it comes to interests. I'm down to go to bars, too, but it gets expensive after a bit. As I get older (god...) I find that I prefer drinking at my or a friend's house and enjoying conversations more than anything. I should say I've been drinking for a while, I'm not going to get drunk and throw a fit or break stuff or be an ass or whatever. I have an apartment in North Olmsted I'm willing to offer as a meeting place as well. Send me a message if you need some a new friend/new friends. And please ignore my username.

P.S. I'm also looking for friends for other general stuff. Coffee/metro parks/biking/soccer, that sort of thing.

P.P.S. Forgive me if this sounds pathetic. It's my first time posting in this subreddit.

Edit: Much better responses than I was gonna get! Apparently ""people who like to have fun"" is a bigger group than I thought it was. I'll be doing some PMing in the next few days.

Edit Edit: Maybe we should have a meetup or something? Is that already a thing?

Edit Edit Edit: The amount of edits in this post is a lot! Seriously, though, I'd like to arrange some sort of meetup to get us all together, next month or so. This month is a bit rough for me due to unforeseen circumstances. Also, I should probably meet people before opening my apartment up to them, or at least so say my roommates. Again, I did not expect this sort of response. I'm also gotten a ton of PM's which I will attempt to get back to soon. In the meantime, something you all should consider which doesn't involve alcohol is this event: http://www.facebook.com/events/132583556910899/?notif_t=plan_user_invited - you may have to copy and paste as I've had a few and don't care to look up how to properly do that. Or even if it will show up to other people. Otherwise, I will get back to everybody soon. I think that there is also a Facebook group for Cleveland Redditors. Also, (by the way, I'm bad with paragraphs) my name is Daniel Stemple, I'm wearing a green shirt and sunglasses in my pic, and you can look me up on Facebook. Check out my shizzle and see if you think we would gel in real life. That may a good way to tell if we would have any mutual interests. Also, I don't typically use words like ""gel"" and ""shizzle"" in real life. Word.

EDIT EDIT EDIT EDIT: Why are there random downvotes on comments in this thread? The comments do contribute to the conversation...I like to think that there is somebody sitting in their momma's basement getting pissed that other people are planning on getting out and being social, and using some pathetic form of judgement to put down other people.

Hello my fellow NE Ohioans! Thanks for the enthusiastic response to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cleveland/comments/1g0khz/can_we_organize_a_protest_in_cleveland/) thread that I posted yesterday. By now I think it is clear we can organize a sizeable rally. If anyone is not up to speed please read these: [r/restorethefourth's intro](http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1fxm1h/introduction_please_read_this_first/), [The Guardian article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data) , and [This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6fnfVJzZT4).

What I have heard most is that we need a clear plan and a clear message. First, the message. Just as our fellow redditors are, we should be called Restore the Fourth. It is simple, and it is our essential point. The [fourth amendment](http://imgur.com/fNjIafj) protects us from exactly what the NSA is doing. We have to demand, politely, an end to unreasonable surveillance of Americans' personal effects. I have heard alot of arguments saying that this is somehow not an issue:

* because it has been going on for years (most of us were not adequately informed)
* because if you have nothing to hide you shouldn't be afraid
* because it keeps us safe(it doesn't)
* because it is legal (it shouldn't be)
* or because they say they aren't doing anything with the information. (This doesn't matter at all! If they aren't using the information, why are they keeping it?)

We should discuss appropriate responses to all of these. We cannot come off as fringe conspiracy nuts. **Violence, vandalism, and division are not our purposes**. The answers need to be as simple and non-political as possible so as not to alienate anyone. American flags and straightforward pickets signs should be all we need when we get out. I would especially love to see some uniformed military folks out there. We should reach out to and welcome any members of any political affiliation that want to join in the fun, just make sure we stay on point. This is not a legalize pot, 2nd amendment, or anarchist rally.


Now for the plan. The general consensus so far has been that Edgewater Park on the Fourth of July is our best bet. I agree. The area is packed with people and everyone is at their most partriotic. Now, before we get their **we have alot to do!** Don't run! There are alot of us to do it, and there will soon be many more. Here is a short list of our needs, please let me know if you can help in any way.

* Supplies: sign materials, flags, pamphlets, flyers, buttons, stickers, coffee, etc (jakprints will make 2500 4x6 gloss double-sided flyers for 75 bucks).
* Facebook/Twitter pages, maybe a website(?). Something professional looking to send interested groups or individuals to. I don't know if we should make a specific Cleveland site, or perhaps someone can head to /r/restorethefourth and see if they can help building the main site.
* A graphic designer(I am working on this right now)
* People willing to go out and hand out flyers to local businesses(book/record stores, coffee shops, anywhere with a bulletin board or ledge.)
* Speakers(humans not audio equipment)
* Media outreach. I will be emailing Rover(who has already brought up this issue at least 3 times), Alan Cox, and Chuck Booms(I know, I know...but he is very LOUD). I honestly don't know where else to go because I don't watch local news. If you have more ideas, say so or just go ahead and do it!
* protest permit, if we can get one. If we can't, I know I will be out there anyway.

If you are out of town or too busy to help consider donating to the [Restore the Fourth indiegogo](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/full-page-ad-for-restore-the-fourth) or the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](http://www.eff.org).
Write, call or email your [representative](http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/)
If you have friends or family in politics talk to them.
Here is a petition: [Pardon for the whistleblower](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/pardon-edward-snowden/Dp03vGYD). 
&gt; In such a world, the rule of law maintains things as they are. Therefore, to begin the process of change, to stop a war, to establish justice, it may be necessary to break the law, to commit acts of civil disobedience, as Southern black did, as antiwar protesters did.

I am certain I forgot a good many important things. Please reply if you notice anything I left out, or or for that matter anything I put in that should be left out. 

Finally, my name is Mike. I am a lifelong Clevelander. I have always had a passion for human rights. I have never organized anything like this before. If anyone is experienced or knows someone who is, I would love your help. Thanks for reading.

1318723909.0	ldmck	An overview of Occupy Cleveland for those sitting on the fence or curious		41	9	47	"The first thing you will notice is that this isn't just a meeting where people get together, say some things, then leave. This is a fully functioning camp with a kitchen, living quarters, workshops and forums for people to bring issues to the camp. People come and go but the purpose is to maintain a continued public presence for the community to organize around. 

**What you will find:**

*Anyone who is hungry being fed for free

*Members of the community dropping off food, clothes, and sanitary supplies

*Live music

*People meeting each other and sharing interests

*Confused passers-by learning about the camp

*Children writing with sidewalk chalk

*Political discussion that spans the spectrum

*Mutual respect that is quite amazing considering the number of opinions represented. People disagree, but there aren't ""sides"" yelling at each other.

*People of all ages, races, and background talking to each other


**What you will not find:**

*Police constantly corralling the group 

*Leaders acting without consent from the group

*People hating America (if they did, why would they care so much about it to sleep near lake Erie in autumn to get their voice heard?)

*People that make you participate in something you disagree with


In sum, the camp is us. The more of us that participate in it the more it represents the entire community. I went down today to help the camp with sanitation so we can stay in the [good graces of the city, police, and community](http://www.wkyc.com/news/article/210024/45/Cleveland-Public-Square-Occupy-Cleveland-goes-on). 

**Occupy Cleveland is unique in that the city and police are sympathetic because we do not disturb the peace and we clean up after ourselves. We need more people who want to help us keep it that way.** 

The camp is proud of the support they have received from the city and police and believe that maintaining a clean, non-violent, respectful environment is critical to maintaining the movement. 

**What you can do:**

*Donate food. Fruit, snacks, and meals that don't require utensils help us keep trash down and stay fed but all food is happily accepted.

*Donate water. 

*Help collect trash. I am helping to collect trash every night, but the more frequent the pick-ups the cleaner the site. 

*Campers are always welcome who want to help the camp keep clean and safe.

*Come talk to folks and decide for yourself. Public demonstration isn't for everyone but there are many other ways you can participate.

From my own perspective, the closest thing I can relate the camp to is a church group. Everyone is very polite and understands we have our own reasons for being there and no one tries to make the occupation about any one issue. If the message from the occupy movement seems confusing its because there are a lot of different people that feel the political system has lost touch with them and we accept them all. **The point of the movement is to show how the people are no longer represented because politics has become a money game that only 1% have access to. That's it.**

Hope to see you there."	t5_2qkh0	True

BUT is anyone else annoyed at the fact there is an international news team of vultures camped out on Seymour trying to pull anything they can out of this to fill time? I was watching CNN last night and got disgusted at the fact that neighborhood has been taken over by newspeople trying to talk to anyone that might have even said ""hi"" to anyone involved with the case.  Does Anderson Cooper and Martin Savidge really need to be ""on the scene"" at this point?

Also... The autotune vid. I know people are fucking dying for this like its the funniest thing out there and I'll probably get downvoted for saying anything bad about it, but to me it just turns the whole thing into a stupid joke.  I get it, another excuse to make another sweet georgia brown/raping errbody out here/kapooyah viral video.  I read that that Ramsey was honored by it, and i'm glad... he deserves to feel great for what he did, he seems like a real good guy... but is there going to be an auto-tune video for everything now?

Edit: To get presale tickets this Thursday: [GO HERE!!!!](http://www.waste.uk.com/) and register for a waste account. Otherwise, tickets go on sale the 10th.  Also, I have heard tickets through waste were $75 but am not sure if that was a GA/lawn seat or if it was something more expensive.

Edit2: All seats are 75 regardless of what kind of seat it is, just FYI. Also, I heard that they are known to sometimes release tickets in spurts throughout the day, so it might be worth it to check back periodically throughout the day. Someone claimed to have gotten tickets at 11:46 for Blossom so this could be real.

I'll share my experience for those who might be afraid to go, because I'll admit that I was very nervous... even though I had no legitimate reason to be. **The entire process took 30 minutes.** (finger prick test) Thanks to new FDA approved testing methods, you don't have to wait four days for results anymore, 20 minutes, that's it. They'll give you a bunch of free condoms (hell yeah, save $10). The staff was very welcoming and willing to answer any questions that I had.

/r/Cleveland, no matter what, it's a good thing to get tested once a year, at minimum for the piece of mind knowing that your negative. If you have any questions, PM me, I'll be glad to help in anyway that I can. Hell, as long as you promise not to axe murder me, I'll even go with you if you need.

It's very hard to be in AA if you don't believe in god or higher powers. I've just been going the past two years because that's all I know. I think I've gotten everything that I can use out of that program. It's starting to really bother me by not knowing anyone who shares the same beliefs (or non-beliefs) that I do, and all the scoffs and laughs I get from people in AA is upsetting. I'd really like to be able to talk about these things and other ways to remain sober without spirituality. I'm feeling alone in this. So if anyone knows of any non-spiritual sobriety support groups in the area I'd really like to know about them. Thanks.	t5_2qkh0	True

Throwaway account, obviously.

I'm set to do three days in a city (not county) jail next weekend, for something I did that 

a) I know was stupid
b) I know was harmful
c) I regret
d) I have taken steps to ensure that I never do again

I wanted to say that to try to get the public flagellation out of the way.

In any event, I'm looking forward to three days in a suburban city jail.  Does anyone know what to expect? 

Apparently, in the framework of Ohio jail types, this is called a ""12-day jail,"" meaning that it's designed to house people for offenses up to 12 days.  Worse than that, I'm guessing, would be Cuy Cnty.

This is probably a shot in the dark ...

1360075117.0	17xm42	Cleveland's attitude problem - let's talk	handlebar_moustache	45	20	54	"I've noticed something disturbing in the three years I've lived here. I constantly hear native Clevelanders complain about the state of their city. They yearn for downtown's glory days and complain about the ""brain drain,"" about people leaving to go elsewhere. Despite all that, they have pride out the ass for this city, which is commendable but confusing.

It's confusing because, when I tell people I'm not from Cleveland - that I moved here, in fact - I always get asked this question with a tinge of judgement in the person's voice: ""Oh, you're not from here originally..?"" and immediately I'm made to feel like an outsider.

Why then, Clevelanders, do you bemoan the city you're so prideful to hail from and want to keep people in while simultaneously making ""being a native"" some exclusive club that outsiders can't possibly understand?

I get it. You've been through some shit. Tough titties. This town is actually really cool, and there are places I haven't even stepped foot in yet, like Gordon Square, that I want to check out. Most of you don't realize what you have here.

Coming from a walking city, the only thing this city is missing is some decent public transportation. Cleveland is a driving city. For that reason alone, it will never thrive the way it used to.

There needs to be some kind of trolley that offers connectivity to all the different hot spots in Cleveland. Have two or three constantly shuttling people between Tremont, Ohio City, West 6th, East 4th, maybe even Coventry.

The biggest issue is people drive in, hang out at one area for a couple hours then leave. If the infrastructure is there for people to have an easy, affordable way to move between Cleveland's most popular spots, more people would be willing to live downtown. It's about the comfort of having other people around you doing the same things you're doing.

That's my two cents, Cleveland. Eager for some dialogue."	t5_2qkh0	True

Below is a link to three maps of Cleveland.... a general view, one more focused on the west side, and one more on the east. They only have the highways, the river, and the lake on them.

What I need from you:

Fill one (or all) of them out! You can use any of the templates I've provided or you can create your own... print it out, draw on it, and scan it. Or draw it in MS Paint. Or if you're really fancy, make it in Photoshop.

This is your subjective view of Cleveland. It can be anything. It could be a map of your favorite bars, or your favorite landmarks, or where you'd take a visiting friend, or first date locations, or it can even be places you'd never go because you don't want to die. Be creative! They don't have to be perfect or anything; they can just be generalized locations. If you're feeling really ambitious, you can make multiple maps for different topics.

The sooner I get these, the better... so within the next week or so. I know everyone's busy with life, but if you could spend even ten minutes helping me, I'd be extremely grateful.

Thank you!

Just about everyone offered to bring trash bags, which is cool, but I don't think we'll need *that* many. I really need a few people to help bring the following items:

Hot dogs, buns, pop and chips, plates and cups. 

If not, I'll see what I can scrounge up. Many thanks to CdeoD for offering to be our chef/grilling extraordinaire. I plan on bringing a frisbee, feel free to bring whatever else you'd like. Everyone that participates in the event will receive a letter from Congressman Dennis Kucinich thanking them for their efforts.

We'll be at the lower pavilion at 11am. [Here's a map.](http://i.imgur.com/PY4qo.jpg)

**Very important:** If the weather is bad on Sunday, I will cancel the event via the [Cleanup Cleveland twitter account](http://twitter.com/#!/cleanupcle) around 9am the morning of and we'll reschedule. 

Anything I'm missing here? 

-------------------------------------------
**Edit:** I've noticed that the majority of the trash in the park is [along the rock wall](http://i.imgur.com/CHpKU.jpg). I don't recommend wearing sandals/flip-flops. 

------------------------------------------

**Very important edit:** I just went a did a little recon at Edgewater and discovered that we're missing electricity (which I've expected) and there are no grills at the lower pavilion. I plan on bringing a generator to supply electricity for the music and warming food in electric appliances if necessary. Although, if anyone has a generator and wouldn't mind bringing it, that would be fantastic and you'd save me a trip. 

Other bad news for us but good news for our chef. CdeoD has informed me that he won't be able to make the event because he just got a new job, so we don't have a someone to grill. But... that's not really an issue now since there aren't any grills. Ideas? 

Lastly, I discovered that there was an [abundance of leaves and weeds growing around the pavilion](http://imgur.com/a/HogtZ). We could easily pull the weeds and rake up the leaves if someone doesn't mind bringing a rake and shovel. 

----------------------------------------

So why don't we seriously plan a real-deal meetup/fiesta/party/event/whatever you want to call it, for redditors within a ~25-75 mile radius of Cleveland? I'm saying to plan this thing 6 months in advance so people can actually plan to come and book a hotel room if they need it. 

What do you think? 

**edit:** I'm not thinking anything crazy at all, really just a well in advance planned meetup so lots of people can come.

Spurred by the vision of founder John O'Brien Sr., over 300 volunteers mobilize annually to breath life into the festival. The culture we celebrate boasts such a wealth of tradition, music, literature, and art -- all bound together by that rich sense of community which typifies the Irish. "	t5_2qkh0	True

It runs and will pass an e-check, but I'm just sick of managing it. So, I want to blow it up. I want to do this legally. Do I need to do this on private property and have permission from the police? Does a pyrotechnic have to do it? How do I go about this?

I just want to watch this thing explode. 

I live in Gates Mills, Ohio and would like to do this locally as I don't want to drive very far.

EDIT: Just so everyone knows, I decided to take the advice of quite a few people on here and donated the car to charity. The car is getting picked up this afternoon, and the proceeds will go to Healing the Children.

While I did want to give it away to the one redditor who said he needed it, I was apprehensive of giving a car to a random stranger who merely said they needed help over the internet."	t5_2qkh0	True

It's a third party company called Allconnect which basically tries to sell you services like cable and direct TV. They don't tell you that this is a 3rd party service and when you sign up for their ""savers"" package which they say includes a Home Depot 10% off Coupon (which it does), that savers package gives them permission to send you all sorts of junk mail.

Kinda pissed now because I didn't realize that it was a third party because they don't tell you this. I realized that when I told them I already had cable and they were trying to get me to switch to Direct TV, but it was already too late, I had given them my email and mailing address.

Just a heads up. If they say they are transferring you to the connections department, if you aren't confident enough to hang up, ask the person on the line before they transfer you if this is a third party connections department. If they say ""yes"" then it's just a cable and satellite TV reseller.

1343080210.0	x1e1i	An idea for renewal.	rodion_kjd	28	6	41	"Hi all,

I'm hoping that somewhere in the great subreddit of Cleveland there are some council members, community organizers, general activists, lawyers, urban planners, and generally sound consultants that can help me work this idea into something feasible.  

Conversely feel free to shoot it down and explain why it won't work, can't work, is impossible.

I call my idea, as it sits today, The Greater Cleveland Rapid Renewal and Revitalization Initiative of 2012.  The basic outline of the GCRRRI is as follows:

In order to increase the popularity of the RTA Rapid Transit Lines and to increase and encourage development of culturally significant areas along green, friendly, efficient, and safe transportation, and to increase the popularity of said RTA Lines while setting the long term goal of increased city revenues the citizens of Reddit propose the following:

1- Any business (gallery, bar, restaurant, store, theater, video arcade, laser tag, putt putt course, bowling alley, liquor store, screen printing shop, concert venue, you name it) that opens withing one half mile of an established RTA Rapid Line Stop AND utilizes an already existing structure will receive the benefit of a 5 year property tax abatement.  In the event they choose to build a new structure a 3 year abatement will be in effect.

2- In the event that an already established company opens a satellite location (IE Great Lakes Brewing Company decides to open a cafe in West Park) the main center benefits from a 1 year abatement in addition to the new business initiatives presented above.

3- In addition by working with local lending institutions (I'm looking at you Fifth Third and US Bank) we will endeavor to offer low interest loans to qualified candidates who present the required small business documentation and support.  These loans will be specially structured and encouraged to support the investments of the young, ""creative class"" (Millenials, generation Y, etc) who have ambition, credentials, drive, but not necessarily sufficient capital to revitalize our great city

4- The city council of Cleveland and appropriate suburbs will work together to simplify, increase the affordability of, and shorten the re-zoning process.  In this way existing structures can more readily be utilized for purposes they were not originally intended for whether that be industrial loft apartments, studio space, or bowling alleys.

5- After the property tax abatements expire tax revenues generated by the business opened under the GCRRRI will be used exclusively and wholly for the development, maintenance, and expansion of the Rapid Lines.  (IE expansion into Tremont, Beachland Ballroom area, Coventry, etc)


This is a basic outline of what I'm thinking.  Feel free to go nuts on it.  Please don't steal it and submit it and become famous for saving Cleveland without me.  Also sorry for the length of this.

TL;DR - If you're too lazy to read it you probably won't be of any help.

Edit 1: I fixed the numbering.  We're well on our way.

Edit 2: As atsonste per suggestion more cooperative banks were worked in."	t5_2qkh0	True

Last night I had a speaker cabinet stolen out of my car in Tremont. Sometime between 10PM and 1:30AM, someone broke my back window and made off with the speaker for my bass amp, a Low Down Sound 2x10"" cabinet. It's made by a small, custom manufacturer, so I can't imagine there are any else like it in the Cleveland area.

I have already filed a police report, and will be checking Craigslist and eBay regularly to see if it turns up. I would also like to check in with any re-sellers or pawn shops in the area, and that's where I figured y'all could provide some advice.

Where are the pawn shops in the area? Tremont, Ohio City, Metro-Clark, West Flats, etc.? Any other thoughts on where the perpetrators might go to get rid of such stolen goods?

I'm pretty uneducated about development of the RTA rapid transit, especially in Cleveland, so I'm curious why there aren't more lines, and why compared to other cities, cleveland's rail transit system just seems less developed.

""The 1985 Supplemental Draft was particularly controversial. Bernie Kosar of the University of Miami earned his academic degree a year early but did not enter the regular draft that year. Rather than finish his eligibility at Miami, he entered into talks with his favorite team, the Cleveland Browns. They advised Kosar to delay his professional eligibility until after the regular draft. They then traded for the right to choose first in the Supplemental Draft. This angered many teams, notably the Minnesota Vikings and New York Giants, who had expressed interest in choosing him in that season's regular draft. Following that season, the NFL instituted the current semi-random supplemental draft order."""	t5_2qkh0	True

I was considering posting an offer to give someone a ride somewhere if their car broke down and they were in desperate need of a ride or anything else like that. I'm just worried because Cleveland isn't the best neighborhood, and I don't know what I could get myself into. I would like to assume that all Redditors are awesome people like the majority undoubtedly are, but I have to wonder if there's anyone with ulterior motives. This just seems like it'd be helpful to some people in a time of need. Missing an interview because your car won't start or something like that would blow. Any thoughts?	t5_2qkh0	True

1376160258.0	1k3nkt	Clifton Blvd in both Lakewood and Cleveland is getting a makeover!	cjrobe	20	2	13	"Self post just so I can provide a tl;dr.

* Curb lane will be bus only lane during rush hour
* 10-minute frequency for busses during rush hour
* New 60' buses similar to healthline
* New traffic lights to give buses priority
* Many new bus stops in both Lakewood and Cleveland
* Cleveland side is being repaved!
* Cleveland side will have a new median with landscaping in the middle
* Cleveland side's road will be widened by two feet.
* Cleveland side's lights will be replaced with metal poles with mast arms.
* Two lanes of traffic on both sides (not a problem, Lakewood is always two lanes of traffic and flows fine)

I think this has the potential to be very pretty and improve the area a lot. I have a few concerns:

* Light timing. They botched the light timing for cars on Euclid.
* Parking in Lakewood. Like the Cleveland side, it seems people will have to adjust to moving their cars at rush hour. Areas near apartment buildings will have a lot of trouble with this.
* No room for a park and ride in Lakewood. People living on the south side of Lakewood won't be able to take as good advantage of this. I would love to drive from Madison to a parking lot on Clifton and take the bus from there. Right now, there is no good transfer to do that and it's a 15 minute walk.

If they can nail the light timing, I think this will be huge for Lakewood, Edgewater, and downtown. I know many people that don't take the bus to work because during rush hour it's way too crowded and it also doesn't run extremely late for sports games. I'm guessing it will run more often at night as well.

They also seem like they've never actually been to Cleveland with the way they talk about places like Playhouse Square. These are qoutes from these people about that area's multimillion dollar transformation. 

""137 shots into that chandelier might wake some politicians up."" 

""OMG! How stupid! Can you say vandalism? Rocks, stones, balloons filled with paint will be thrown at it. Remember, this IS Cleveland..."" 

""So this is how the county plans to spend millions of dollars in casino tax revenue. In a city where we have a new ""House of Horrors"" discovered on a regular basis now. In a city with some of the most impoverished, violent, and depressed neighborhoods in America. The tax revenue from a casino monopoly is gonna build us a massive outdoors chandelier...""

These people seriously disgust me. I live at Cleveland State. I perform in Playhouse Square, I walk downtown all the time. What silly messed up fantasy world are these people living in.

He very suddenly and unexpectedly was hospitalized while we were in Houston and we unfortunately had to find a replacement and continue on the tour without him. We hope to have him back soon but his disease is so rare that a treatment has only become available recently and runs tens of thousands of dollars a month. Our cast and crew have been raising money to help his family with their medical expenses but obviously we can only do so much while on the road. We've set up a fund raising account where donors can receive autographed posters from the cast, tickets to the shows, etc. and if anyone is in the Cleveland area we'll be at Becky's Bar and Grill tonight, November 10th, around 10:30 doing Karaoke and the owners have offered to donate 20% of the restaurants total profits from tonight to Matt's fund. We're also holding a cabaret starring the cast and holding a silent auction at Pickwick and Frolic on Wednesday, November 14th at 11:00 pm with all the money going to Matt. If you're in Cleveland this week, we'd love to have you come out or if you can give any amount through our fund raising site, it would be incredibly appreciated. Thank you!

1346470626.0	z65w3	Portlander settling in to Cleveland - Thoughts so far	Awesomus_Prime	25	7	32	"I moved here recently and I have a few things I would like to say.

First off, I am amazed how polite and kind everyone is. I constantly get smiling faces asking me how i am and randomly saying hello while im walking down the street. This is something that doesn't happen where im from. 

The weather is very similar to the NW with the exception of a slight lake smell (After a few weeks i quit smelling it) and humidity. Also, I must say that the parks I have visited are really impressive. 

The food is large and for the most part tasty. Being in beer and wine country has spoiled me, I find that there are really shitty wine here that is priced sky high. I am not disappoint at the beer though (price is a little high). The cheese is great as well.

I have noticed that drivers here are a little selfish. It is almost like they dare you to hit them. Where I'm from, we are admittedly too giving. We stop at yellow lights in fear of running a red light, where here it seems like EVERYONE runs red lights. 

The streets in many places are shit, It is really tearing up my shocks and I think we need to get our shit together and fix these roads. 

Cleveland is VERY car friendly though. A traffic jam here is nothing compared to Portland. This leads me to my next point.... Public Transportation appears to suck ass here. 

Homeless people seem not to exist here, really weird for me. Maybe its the harsh winters that keep them away, but I seldom see one wandering around. 

Employment rocks here. Since I have arrived, I have been offered several well paying jobs and I have actually been able to choose between them. Unemployment is so bad in Oregon that I might get one job offer in every 100 jobs i apply for, where here I apply for 8 jobs and i get 3 offers. I love it....

Weed, It seems like it doesn't exist here. All i hear from my coworkers is how often they drink and generally rely on alcohol to live and work in Cleveland. Is it taboo here? In Portland its a common socially accepted thing to do. 

Overall, I like the place.
