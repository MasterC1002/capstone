1347983905.0	1031bh	The sad, sad tale of bacon.	loupgarou21	58	3	14	"I had a pork belly sitting in my freezer, and a desire to make bacon.

I grabbed the package from the freezer, thawed it out and went about curing it.

While applying the cure, I thought to myself, there sure isn't a lot of fat on this belly, but no big deal, it'll just be a bit on the lean side.

Throughout the week I checked on my curing meat and kept thinking ""this sure isn't behaving like my past bacons"", but it still smelled fine, so I didn't give it much thought.

Come the following weekend I smoke it and slice it.

Drat! This bacon isn't just a little lean, it super lean. There's almost no fat at all, and it's a bit on the tough side .

It still tastes good, not quite like normal bacon, but good.  So, I froze the bacon with the thought that I would just use it for cooking in other dishes.

A couple of days pass, and my wife and I are inventorying our deep freeze.  

Hey, what's this package of meat?  Why, it's a pork belly... Wait, didnt I just cure that?  And wait, didn't I have a beef brisket that I hadn't smoked yet?

Apparently I tried to make bacon from beef brisket."	t5_2t1u1	True

1365975387.0	1ccjho	What are some things you got wrong early in your charcuterie experience?	BankshotMcG	35	5	36	"I bought a meat grinder about a year and a half ago. Used it twice, but always found it a pain. Sinew would catch on the grates, clog it up, and I'd have to disassemble it every five minutes. 

But today I'm cleaning out my freezer, and turning all the meat into MEGA-EMPANADA MIX -- turkey, beef, chicken, pork, everything except fish becomes a delicious gyro-like composite to stuff inside empanada pockets. Or maybe I'll just slow compress it into deli meat loaf or something since I'm cutting back on bread. Point is: this was going to become the turducken of meat mixes, so I had to take semi-thawed meat and chilled grinder in hand to face the work. 

About halfway through the laborious burger grind, I had to dismantle the grinder for the fifth time. Then I got curious about something.

I reversed the fan blade, which previously used to sit snugly flush to the end of the screw. Now it stuck out, its beautiful curves facing inward and the flat outer bit presenting its face to the world. 

...my meat rolled out in fat ribbons just fine, with no sinew clogging the grain.

Gosh, I've been doing it wrong all this time. I can make my own burgers and sausages at last! Dumb me reversed the ""blade"" when cleaning it for the first time and never considered it might go the other way. 

Anybody else correct a simple mistake they wish they'd known early on, re: preparation, ingredients, process?"	t5_2t1u1	True

I thought it would be good if we put together a list of various charcuterie resources. Feel free to make separate posts about your recommendations if you want, but I will use this to space to try and make a comprehensive list of suggestions and recommendations. 

I will post a link in the side bar to this thread in case it gets buried.

[**Home Production of Quality Meats and Sausages** Stanley Marianski, Adam Marianski](http://www.amazon.com/Home-Production-Quality-Meats-Sausages/dp/0982426739/ref=pd_sim_b_2) There has been a need for a comprehensive one-volume reference on the manufacture of meats and sausages at home. The book covers topics such as curing and making brines, smoking meats and sausages, U.S. Standards, making fresh, smoked, emulsified, fermented and air dried products, making special sausages such as head cheeses, blood and liver sausages, low salt, low fat and Kosher products, hams, bacon, butts and loins, poultry, fish and game, creating your own recipes and much more...

[**The Art of Making Fermented Sausages** Stanley Marianski, Adam Marianski](http://www.amazon.com/Art-Making-Fermented-Sausages/dp/0982426712/ref=pd_sim_b_5)
The majority of books written on making sausages do not tackle the subject of fermented sausages at all. The topic is limited to a statement that this is an advanced field of sausage making which is not recommended for an amateur sausage maker. Well, the main reason for writing this book was that the authors did not share this opinion. On the contrary, they believed that any hobbyist could make wonderful salami at home, if he only knew how. Highly technical papers were published in Food Technology journals which unfortunately were written in very difficult terms. Thus the idea of bridging the technology gap that existed between Meat Science and the requirements of the typical hobbyist was born. With more information obtainable every day, and commercial starter cultures available to the public, there is little reason to abstain from making quality salamis at home, regardless of the climate and outside conditions.


**[Nose To Tail by Fergus Henderson](http://www.amazon.com/Whole-Beast-Nose-Tail-Eating/dp/0060585366/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1329202504&amp;sr=8-1)** The Whole Beast: Nose to Tail Eating is a certified ""foodie"" classic. In it, Fergus Henderson -- whose London restaurant, St. John, is a world-renowned destination for people who love to eat ""on the wild side"" -- presents the recipes that have marked him out as one of the most innovative, yet traditional, chefs. Here are recipes that hark back to a strong rural tradition of delicious thrift, and that literally represent Henderson's motto, ""Nose to Tail Eating"" -- be they Pig's Trotter Stuffed with Potato, Rabbit Wrapped in Fennel and Bacon, or his signature dish of Roast Bone Marrow and Parsley Salad. 

[**The Alchemist's Book of Salami and Other Fermented Sausages by William R. Mende**](http://www.thealchemist.us/alchemist1_007.htm) Included are chapters devoted to meat, ingredients, microbiology, pathogens and their control, cultures and their use, as well as formulas for Cervelat, Salsiccia Spalmabile, Longaniza, Lebanon Bologna, Summer Sausage, Chorizo, Italian Salami, French Garlic Sausage, Pepperoni, Soppressata, and many others.

Moderator Hamsterdam has given me her blessing to post this thread so big thanks to her.

We are a fairly new subreddit focusing on, as the name suggests, food made entirely from scratch.

I know a lot of you that come here make your own cured meats, terrines, pate's and so on. I think that's really awesome, as a matter of fact I have been a subscriber here for a month or so and currently have a pork belly curing in the fridge. Why not show off what you've made and what you do with what you've made over at /r/fromscratch? I think charcuterie is a great albeit rapidly disappearing art. The more people we can get interested the better!

So what qualifies as ""from scratch?""

Make your own bread? Share it!

Made a sauce or soup? Let us check it out!

Obviously any kind of charcuterie, condiments, or pickling is awesome. 

Anything that's made from scratch we want to see!

Also, if you look in the side bar there there's a link to what is ""from scratch."" We are still kind of defining it so for now just use your best judgement. 

Well, look forward to seeing some of you over there!

One more big thanks to Hamsterdam and the great community here!

[BACON PICTURES] (http://imgur.com/a/FyGgT#EReHc)

* Pic 1: Some of the stuff that went in. 
* Pic 2: my ghetto smoker 
* Pic 3: smoked slab
* Pic 4: the bacon was still warm, so pieces were a big ragged
* Pic 5: money shot
* Pic 6: self explanatory
* Pic 7: closer version of self explanatory
* Pic 8: rendered bacon fat from a substantial layer of fat I removed after smoking. 

I removed the layer of skin/fat, cubed it, then rendered it down to save the fat. The crispy cubes of skin/fat were then tossed in some brown sugar I melted down into a basic caramel. The crispy, sweet, salty &amp; smoky cubes of fat were amazingly delicious &amp; juicy in the middle. Kinda like a bacon flavored jelly bean, except not disgusting-sounding.

The bacon was the 3rd best bacon I've ever had. I put it in a BLT, with cherry tomatoes, and arugula instead of lettuce. I put some homemade sriracha mayo on a baguette and stuffed everything inside.

I ended up going with [this recipe](http://www.lets-make-sausage.com/best-hot-dog.html) and just ran the meat through my smallest grinder plate twice, but skipped the emulsifying step.

I ended up hot smoking the hot dogs for about 2 hours, and they came out with the consistency I was looking for.

I did increase the garlic powder to almost 1tbsp from 2tsp after tasting the initial mixture (didn't add the curing salt until after tasting it).  I'm going to cut the mace to about 2tsp the next time I make this recipe though, as it's a little on the strong side compared to the other spices.

Maybe it's a regional thing, but the hot dogs I've gotten from butchers in my area are about the same consistency as the hot dogs I made, which leads me to believe they aren't emulsifying the meat either.

It is being raised super humanely and organic by a neighbor, and being fed the whey from a goat dairy(making some of the best cheese I've ever had).   
We have had some good success curing salamis, pancetta, and duck breast, but have never attempted anything of this scale, and after meeting the fine beast last week, I am even more determined to do it right.
My friend has a converted closet aging room to age the meat, and We are constructing some large wooden boxes for the initial curing of the procuitto(we plan to cure both the butt and the ham as procuitto).
We have a kitchen aid with a grinder attachment, and a 3lb capacity hand stuffer for sausage.  Are we going to burn up the motor making sausages?
Where is a good supplier for bulk salt?  How much salt do we need?
I'm thinking of getting a giant container filled with ice for the slaughter(but I'm afraid of it breaking during transport under the weight of 150lbs of meat and 100lbs of ice).  Any better ideas for safe transportation and storage during processing?
Are there any good books on the subject or useful online resources(I've only found quick run throughs which weren't very thorough)?

LT_Sealice	16	2	4	"I've been out of the food industry for a long time now, but used to work as a sous chef when I was younger. I'm interested in getting into charcuterie, but I have no idea where to start.

I want to start off with something easy, I'm thinking pancetta. 


---

I found what I believe to be a good recipe, but I need some tips/advice/guidance on the subtleties.

One 5-pound slab pork belly, skin removed
For the dry cure
4 garlic cloves, minced
2 teaspoons pink salt (see Note)
1/4 cup Morton’s kosher salt
2 tablespoons dark brown sugar
2 tablespoons juniper berries, crushed with the bottom of a small saute pan
4 bay leaves, crumbled
1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
4 or 5 sprigs fresh thyme
4 tablespoons coarsely ground black pepper, divided
DIRECTIONS
1. Trim the belly so that its edges are neat and square.
2. Combine the garlic, pink salt, kosher salt, dark brown sugar, juniper berries, bay leaves, nutmeg, thyme, and half the black pepper in a bowl and mix thoroughly so that the pink salt is evenly distributed. Rub the mixture all over the belly to give it a uniform coating over the entire surface.
3. Place the belly in a 2-gallon Ziploc bag or in a covered nonreactive container just large enough to hold it. Refrigerate for 7 days. Without removing the belly from the bag, rub the belly to redistribute the seasonings and flip it over every other day — a process called overhauling.
4. After 7 days, check the belly for firmness. If it feels firm at its thickest point, it’s cured. If it still feels squishy, refrigerate it on the cure for 1 to 2 more days.
5. Remove the belly from the bag or container, rinse it thoroughly under cold water, and pat it dry. Sprinkle the meat side with the remaining black pepper. Starting from a long side, roll up the pork belly tightly, as you would a thick towel, and tie it very tightly with butcher’s string at 1- to 2-inch intervals. It’s important that there are no air pockets inside the roll. In other words, it can’t be too tightly rolled. Alternately, the pancetta can be left flat, wrapped in cheesecloth, and hung to dry for 5 to 7 days.
6. Using the string to suspend it, hang the rolled pancetta in a cool, humid place to dry for 2 weeks. The ideal conditions are 50°F to 60°F (8°C to 15°C) with 60 percent humidity, but a cool, humid basement works fine, as will most any place that’s out of the sun. (I often hang mine in our kitchen next to the hanging pans on either side of the stove.) Humidity is important: If your pancetta begins to get hard, it’s drying out and should be wrapped and refrigerated. The pancetta should be firm but pliable, not hard. Because pancetta isn’t meant to be eaten raw, the drying isn’t as critical a stage as it is for items such as prosciutto or dry-cured sausages. But drying pancetta enhances its texture, intensifies its flavor, and helps it to last longer.
7. After drying, the pancetta can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for 3 weeks or more, or frozen for up to 4 months. Freezing makes it easier to slice thin.

I think that part of the problem is that I didn't leave it in the brine for long enough, but I don' think that explains the whole issue. As it was the first time I'd made such a piece, I started small, with a 2kg / 4lb leg joint. The guide I'd used said 2 days per kilo, so I left it for 4 days.  

However, once I'd boiled and roasted it, the cure only looked to have penetrated about a half an inch. Even in 4 days, the brine should have gone further in than this, no?  

I added a bunch of stuff to the cure: apple juice, sugar, ginger beer, and spices, so it was quite rich and thick; can this be the problem? I still kept the ratio of Salt to liquid correct, according to this recipe: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvgQCa29LEM&amp;t=4448s.

I've learned that cutting the meat into strips is far easier to grind than cutting them into cubes (as I see recommended in a few places.)  Partially freezing the meat makes everything much easier, but I'm having an issue with my grinder.

I'm using a kitchenaid with the kitchenaid grinder attachment.  Is the blade supposed to be pretty dull?  I wouldn't think it should be, but the blade on mine is so dull that I could sit there and run my finger over the sharp part of the blade repeatedly for hours, and the worst I would likely experience is a blister from repeatedly rubbing my finger on a hunk of metal.

I'm guessing this has a lot to do with the blade being so dull, but I also have to clean out the blade about every pound of meat I grind because it's gotten to tangled up in connective tissue.  I tried to remove all the silver skin I could find, but still ended up having to clean out the blade fairly frequently.  Not so much for the veal I was grinding, but I definitely had issues with that when grinding some pork shoulder butt.  Is this normal?

By and large, most recipes I can find for the production of sausages (circa 14th century or so) involve air-drying to some extent. A handful are made and eaten very quickly, but many more are basically: ""chop meat, mix with spices, stuff into intestines, hang in the smoke/chimney for a few days, store.""

Seems to me it would probably be some kind of fermented semi-dry sausage, a la summer sausages and the like. Many would be smoked, based on recipes.

Anyone have any tips on making a quality smoked fermented semi-dry sausage? I'm thinking of just adapting a generic summer sausage technique to a different lean/spice formulation, but tips are always appreciated. I'm also looking for traditional European recipes that may provide some insight. And yes, I've already picked over Len Poli's collection. :)

Anyone know if there's a process for rendering these shelf-stable? Technically, shelf stability is only achieved through a combination of pH and water activity (ph &lt; 5.2 and aW &lt;0.86), or some kind of validated process. 

I mean, I'm sure an acidified sausage that's only mostly dried (maybe a 0.90 aW) will be fine for a while, and I have no issue refrigerating the stuff - it's just a point of curiosity."	t5_2t1u1	True

so now i have cured, cooked to 155-160 pork belly.    it looked good, but after crisping it up it was pretty 'stringy'.... maybe a bit dry and tasted 'hammy'

im going to smoke the other slabs, along with cured pork loin tomorrow...but im considering just slicing some of it raw and cooking in pan.

maybe it cured to long?    it had good sweet and decent salty taste..but was hammy then a thin, crispy piece of bacon.

One thing that I miss most of all are the Italian, world famous cured meats. Now I'm not saying I'm here to manufacture my own Prosciutto Crudo (as lovely as that would be) but I'm very interested in dry salami as well as possibly curing my own simpler meats like bacon or pancetta. I'm in college and a few buddies of mine have agreed to go in on this with me but first I figured I'd clear it with the experts.

Here's my plan



**Curing Box:**
Go thrifting for either a minifridge or a full size, a humidifier (it's very dry where I live) and a weather gauge to tell if I've got correct climate control. A temperature gauge control as necessary. *(as seen in this post: http://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/16fpnf/my_curing_chamber/)*



**Stuffer:**
http://www.amazon.com/LEM-Products-Stainless-Vertical-Sausage/dp/B000SQDTRC/



**Casings:**
http://www.americanspice.com/32mm-fresh-sausage-casing/



**Spices:**
Sea Salt
Fennel
Garlic Powder
Peppercorns
Some form of red wine *(Should I go cheap box wine or spring for price?)*
*(Any other suggestions?)*



**Meat:**
And of course, I need to locate a good butcher in my area. I'm going to the farmer's market this weekend and plan on looking around for a guy who knows a guy. 



Now a few questions: To hang dry sausage it seems like I don't actually *need* a full length fridge (I'm interested in fairly short sausage not the longer styles) or could I make do with a mini fridge?



**Finally:**
What else should I be worried about? I'm planning on starting fairly small to get recipes figured out and then scaling up. Does this sound right?

1370623115.0	1fvcui	Sea Salt Only Bacon	mtkd	11	4	2	"There has been a couple of posts about pink salt lately.

I started making bacon a couple of years ago. With only sea salt.

1) Take a full pork belly with bones in, skin on, no scoring

2) Bone it myself using a filleting knife to ensure there are no holes or flaps in the belly for moisture to trap

3) Rub course sea salt all over the belly, the sides etc.

4) Place in a large stainless steel bowl - folding the belly in half (I have seen people cut it in to two instead and stack them)

5) Fill gently with enough filtered water to just cover the belly and tip some extra salt in to the water

6) Cover with upside-down plates to keep the belly submerged

7) Fridge it for 3 - 4 days (5 days gets a bit too salty), turning it over once - if it is too salty you can soak in fresh water for half a day

8) Take out, rinse with fresh water and dry will paper towels, then hang at room temp for a day using meathooks (to get any final moisture off)

9) Store skin side down in your separate cured meat fridge on a baking rack, moving it occasionally on first couple of days so moisture doesn't develop against rack

This is ready too cook immediately, but great after a couple of weeks. Cut it with a sharp knife skin-side down on a board.

I've got a 7 month old end piece in my meat fridge which is too hard to cut with a knife now but hasn't spoiled at all.

The only issue I've had has been leaving a flap and moisture getting in - but could smell immediately the problem and it cut out fine.

This is after a couple of days - you can see where it has stretched a little on the left from being hung:

So hey! I made bacon.  I put it in a dry cure with celery salt as a preservative for 7 days, roasted it until an internal 145 F- voila, bacon.  Note: unsmoked.

How long is something like this good for in open air/fridge/freezer conditions?
How would smoking affect that timetable?

2nd part: shipping-
Based on your answer, what's the cheapest way to go about shipping 5 lbs of that unsmoked bacon to a non-commercial doorstep? Please also include your answer for smoked.

1341385271.0	w0sjr	Ammonia-cured sausage 	NoProdigalSon	7	2	6	"I love my cured meats and prefer buying organic, nitrate/nitrite free meat. My significant other is allergic to the preservatives in pork, so I do this whenever possible.

The other day I purchased an artisan sausage from a local cheese shop, made of heritage breed pork, preservative-free, etc. I discovered that the sausage was covered in fuzzy mold after I peeled off the wax paper packing.

The cheese shop owner acted like this was normal, and suggested I simply cut off the casing. I did so, carefully making sure I didn't touch the meat with my fungus-y fingers/knife. 

However, the meat still had that odor of ammonia even after the casing (and mold) were stripped away. Nevertheless, my dinner party of four ate the whole thing without any ill effects.

Now, nobody got sick or anything, but the smell of cat pee greatly lessened my enjoyment of what probably would have been a delicious craft meat. 

What happened here? Is this a normal, inevitable occurrence of preservative-free but store-bought sausage? The odor seeped into the meat already, so I don't think it was my prep that caused the crossover.

Or should I have made more of a fuss with the shop owner? Nobody likes buying a moldy product...except bleu cheese."	t5_2t1u1	True

Keep all equipment and meat cold: If the meat and equipment isn't kept as close to freezing as practical, the sausage will ""smear,"" making your homemade sausage look much fatter than it really is. Smearing is caused by the fat warming and very slightly melting, ""smearing"" over the lean meat. Of course the homemade sausage is not fatter, and there is no harm done. The benefit is that your homemade sausage will look as lean as it really is, before cooking. Of course when you start to cook it, it makes no difference at all

1337447731.0	tuvy5	Confused on home cured bacon! Would appreciate some help!	transt	5	1	6	"Hello,

So last week we did our first attempt at home cured bacon and smoked it ( http://www.reddit.com/r/smoking/comments/tdt9o/smoked_bacon_for_the_first_time_today_what_do_you/ ) and it turned out very well.

I am confused now though because we want to try a maple cured bacon recipe, but I am not confident in our approach. I saw a recipe for it here:

http://stephhicks68.hubpages.com/hub/maple-cured-bacon

that was very similar to other recipes that I saw. The confusing part is that they don't actually smoke or cook the bacon in the oven before frying.

When we did the first batch, we did two portions of the pork belly that we cured with kosher salt, black pepper, and brown sugar. We then smoked one as shown above, and did the other in the oven similar as described here:

http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/28/dining/the-art-of-making-your-own-bacon.html

(oven cooked). We then fried it to crispy before eating.

So my question is:

Will the bacon be safe to eat with just curing and then frying in a pan? Why does the NYtimes recipe (which was very similar to a bunch of other ones online), have you cook the bacon before frying it crispy and eating it?

None of the recipes use ""pink salt"", how would this effect the need to cook it before frying?

Thank you!

I couldn't figure out a way to make it so it was sliceable. I ended up freezing one of the 'loafs' and tomorrow I'll attemp to slice it with a deli slicer and the other loaf I packed into small glass jars. 

I was wondering if anyone has any insight on this underrated but delicious item. If the freezing doesn't work my next course of action is to press it between two sheet pans with no aspic and see if I can cut out sections of it neatly then.

I just read a post in which someone mentions a pastrami recipe and links to Ruhlman's blog with his pastrami recipe. The pickling spice looks the exact same, but calls for 2-4 bay leaves. Is this a typo? I started brining my corned beef yesterday and now am wondering if I need to start over. 
Update: I contacted Michael Ruhlman through his website and he confirmed that it is a typo- it should be 2-4 bay leaves (not 24). Good to know for future reference (and for anyone using that recipe for corned beef this year). Since I only used the 2 tablespoons I'm just going leave my corned beef as is, but I will use a different pickling spice when I cook it.

I can sometimes find it at the local SuperValu or Roundy's chain, and I can sometimes get it at Byerly's/Lunds (although, according to their butcher, they've been getting shorted on their veal orders lately,) but it's very hit or miss.  The butcher shops I've looked at in the area mostly just carry ground veal, if anything at all.

I've mostly just taken to checking the grocery store I'm at to see if they have veal, buying everything I see if it's a good price and then freezing it for future use.

Does anyone know of a good source for mail order veal?  I'm currently mostly interested in using it for sausage making, so I don't need a super expensive cut of meat.

I thought that this Christmas I'd bake a ham.  Didn't have enough time to get it smoked (by the butcher) after slaughter, so instead my farmer friend had his butcher cut me a 10 lb shank end ham.  I'm getting it on Wednesday.  It's skin on, with nothing else done to it (except it's vacuum sealed and frozen).

I've been searching the interwebs for fresh ham recipes. I see a lot of them are really recipes for pre-baked store-bought pre-smoked hams.  That's not what I'm doing.

[I've found this recipe](http://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/2012/12/roasted-fresh-ham-with-citrus-and-rye) which I was planning on giving a go.  However, I notice that the curing process is a dry cure (salt rub on the leg, in a plastic bag for four days), and then baking.  I'm not sure if it should be dry cure (because the recipe doesn't say that, but it doesn't say add water either).  And, if so, if that's okay.

Also, a lot of the recipes/instructions that I read on the web call for soaking the ham in water before cooking.  I presume that this is because you want to take OUT some of all of that salt that you put into the ham before cooking it.  However, if it's a dry cure, this doesn't seem necessary (I'm trying to fill in the blanks for my self here).  Do I understand something incorrectly.

I can cook many many things without recipes.  I'm pretty handy in the kitchen.  So I really want to make sure I understand what's going on so I can do it right.

It seems that the recipe calls for baking right after dry curing.  No soaking.  No smoking.  Sound right?

I recently spotted some of those precooked, chemical-laden Johnsonville Smoked Bratwurst and their ""Better Cheddar Brats"" or whatever they call them in the ""processed meat"" section of my supermarket ... and my mouth watered, although I've never tried either of them.

Are either of these even worth eating? If so, how can I prepare them to bring out their best? I can get both creamy and grainy Maille Dijon mustards, which is what I served with fresh-meat brats when I was in the US.

I have a stove, a microwave, and a very small crappy oven. No broiler. I can't BBQ outside, but I have a cast-iron grill pan with a lid for the stove top.

Advise me, please!

The hog was pastured and well exercised so it is fairly lean (no thick fat layers in the side, mostly meat). 

My original plan was to make some bacon out of it but now I'm wondering if there is another style of charcuterie that would be better suited due to the lack of fat.

Any ideas?"	t5_2t1u1	True

Recipe that I'm following says to smoke to an internal temperature of 150. Here's my problem.  One of my thermometer says 140° the other says 153. I don't know which either are correct. Beyond all the regular advice of going and getting a good thermometer, which is too late to do right now, is it better to pull it now and maybe a little under?

I had a homebrewer friend go over to Beligum and she had a sausage that was made with a sour beer, so I have been asked if I could conjure something up. Of course, Google hasn't been much help since it is mainly showing me results about cooking sausages in beer. 

Anyone have any ideas, or maybe a base recipe I could use. I can get a hold of some home brewed Berliner Weisse. A little notes on the flavors of a Berliner is a clean lactic sourness which can be quite strong, some complementary bready or grainy wheat flavor can be noticeable. No hop bitterness or flavor. 

I figure I would need to let the carbonation dissipate before starting.
