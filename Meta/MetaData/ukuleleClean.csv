I've noticed that some people struggle to pick out melodic lines or chords of a particular song that they're trying to play, based on a recording they're listening to. This problem (I don't like that word, but I'll use it until I find a better one for it) is not unique to the ukulele - I've seen it in every instrument that relies more on ear than sheet music. The issue is a simple one - people aren't developing their musical ears. This is no fault of the players - it's a complicated topic to try and immerse yourself in without any guidance! 

With this in mind, I now present my guide to the intervals, ukulele edition!

--------

Introduction
-

Just as atoms are the building blocks of life, so intervals are the building blocks of music. An interval is defined as the space between two notes, wether they sound at the same time, or consecutively. Every bit of music that you hear can be broken down into a series of intervals. Bach? Intervals. The Foo Fighters? Intervals. Your doorbell? Intervals. There are two main things that you should know about intervals - (1) how big or small it is, and (2) what it sounds like. By learning how to identify intervals by ear, you will be able to transcribe songs with ease! 

**What this guide will give you:**

- a basic understanding of the building blocks of music (intervals)
- a better understanding of how chords and scales are made up
- a method of developing your ear (aural skills)
- Some interesting music facts to wow your friends!

**What this guide will not give you**

- understanding of advanced interval topics
- instant mastery of intervals - you will need to put some effort into learning intervals, but it will pay off tenfold. 

**Prerequisite Knowledge**

You should know a few things before starting this lesson:

- How to read tablature
- How to make sounds on a ukulele
- Know the musical alphabet (if you don't know it, it's A B C D E F G A B C ... etc.)
- How to read english

Being able to read music notation is not a requirement, I'll work in tablature for this lesson. 

---------

Basic Interval Information
-

There are two kinds of intervals: Harmonic Intervals and Melodic Intervals. This is just a fancy way of saying ""Notes that are played at the same time"" and ""Notes that aren't"". [Here](http://i.imgur.com/N1SYKwF.jpg) is an example of a harmonic interval. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/Fxaka4T.jpg) is an example of a melodic interval. Melodic intervals can go up (ascending) or down (descending).  We'll be learning mainly about melodic intervals, as they are easier to hear. I'll give examples of how to hear ascending intervals, and put a reference with a list of ways to hear descending intervals at the end of this guide. I'll put info about harmonic intervals in 

&gt;quotes like this.


There are also two parts to an interval's name. The first is its *quality* and the second is its *type*. For example, one interval is called a Major Third. Its *quality* is major, and its *type* is a third. 

**Types of Intervals**

There are 8 basic types of intervals:

- Unisons
- Seconds
- Thirds
- Fourths
- Fifths
- Sixths
- Sevenths
- Octaves

An interval's type is based on the letter name of the notes. For example, any A (no matter sharp, flat, or natural) that goes up to any B (no matter sharp, flat, or natural) will be a type of second. Any  F that goes up to any C will by a type of Fifth. How am I getting the type? I count letter names. Let's look at the F-C example. If you count notes from F up to C, starting with F=1, you get 5 notes from an F to a C. Thus, it's a Fifth. Why don't you try one now? An E that goes up to an A. 

...

...

...

If you said a Fourth, you'd be correct!

This also applies to intervals that go *down*. For example, when we said that an F up to a C was a type of Fifth, what about an F *down* to a C? Start with F = 1, then count down to C. You should get C = 4. This makes it a type of Fourth.

&gt;Tip: when dealing with harmonic intervals, count up from the lower note or count down from the higher note to get the interval name! 


**Qualities of Intervals**

This is a little more tricky to deal with. While the type refers to the note names, the quality deals with the actual distance between the notes. Naming an interval by type alone is like saying ""I live 4000 miles from Detroit"". Naming an interval by both type and quality is like saying ""I live 4021.63 miles from Detroit"". You get the basic distance either way, but with the second one you are more precise. (and both ways you are a LONG way from detroit). On the ukulele, you can tell the quality of interval by the number of frets (along one string) between the notes.

There are 5 main types of interval, from smallest to largest: 

- diminished
- minor
- Major 
- Perfect
- Augmented

&gt; Note the use of capital letters. It's important. 

That's all the information on quality that I will cover right now. I'd just like you to be aware of the names, we will cover more after we learn the intervals. 

-------

Unisons 
-

These are important intervals to be able to hear in order to tune your instrument. They're fortunately easy to hear!

**Perfect Unison (P1, or U)**

This is the easiest interval to learn. The distance between two notes of a Perfect Unison are *Zero* frets apart. That's right, it's the same note!

Here are a few examples of Perfect Unisons:

- [1](http://i.imgur.com/yoY5wNi.jpg)
- [2](http://i.imgur.com/Wx0IGAt.jpg)
- [3](http://i.imgur.com/6AAGFnq.jpg)

&gt; the last example is a harmonic Perfect Unison! You use this interval to tune you strings to themselves. 

Because Unisons are the same note, they are easy to hear. Is the second note higher or lower than the first note? No? You've got yourself a Unison!

---------

Seconds
-

Seconds are pretty cool intervals, as they will be the ones you use the most often. Almost every type of scale is made up of a combination of the different type of seconds.

&gt;Lingo: moving a melodic line by a second is called *stepwise motion*. Moving by a larger interval is called *motion by skip*. 

**minor Second (m2, or half step, or semitone)**

The smallest of the seconds (we're ignoring diminished and Augmented for now), this has a distance of one fret on your uke. Pick any note on your instrument. Now move one fret up. BAM! you've got a minor Second. In the music theory world, we define all the other intervals by how many half steps it is made of. So if you're thinking 1 fret = 1 half step, then you're doing great! Here are some examples of minor seconds:

- [1](http://i.imgur.com/SSnbm05.jpg)
- [2](http://i.imgur.com/CCf3ZUU.jpg)
- [3](http://i.imgur.com/SSSTve7.jpg)

&gt; the last example is a harmonic minor Second! This interval is what makes ""maj7"" chords sound so cool!


The key to hearing minor Seconds is to listen for the ""Jaws"" theme. Slowly alternate between the two notes in one of the examples above, then get faster and faster. See how it sounds like Jaws?


**Major Second (M2, or whole step, or tone)**

The largest of the seconds, this has a distance of 2 frets. A pretty cool scale that you can play with this interval is called the Whole Tone scale. Simply move up or down in whole steps and you get a unique-sounding lick that you can use to tie two seconds of a solo together. Here are some examples of a whole step:

- [1](http://i.imgur.com/M4rxWCO.jpg)
- [2](http://i.imgur.com/clcJtCY.jpg)
- [3](http://i.imgur.com/xHYLv11.jpg)

&gt; the last example is a harmonic Major Second! This is the first interval you hear in the song Chopsticks. 

Do you know the happy birthday song? well the notes on the words ""-ppy"" and ""Birth"" are a Major Second! You can also think of the first two notes of a scale. 

&gt; Bonus: can you identify the interval between the notes on ""Ha"" and ""-ppy""? ....... If you said Perfect Unison, you'd be right!


--------

Thirds
-

Thirds are another cool interval, and I'll tell you why. Right now. The chords we use are based on stacking thirds. A major chord is a Major Third with a minor Third stacked on top. A minor chord is a minor Third with a Major Third stacked on top. A seventh chord (for example, G7) is a Major third, then a minor third, then another minor third. It's actually pretty fun to see what kinds of chords you can get by stacking the different types of thirds (if you're a music nerd like I am)

&gt;Music Theory tidbit: Harmony by the stacking of thirds is called *tertian* harmony. During the 1800s and on, composers started expiramenting with harmony based on stacking fourths (*quartal*) and stacking fifths (*quintal*). If you've ever played Super Smash Bros Melee and watched the opening title sequence, the big chord that plays right before the tempo picks up (0:14 in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_MSl3XGfwE) video) is a Quartal Chord!

**minor Third (m3)**

This interval is three half steps wide, meaning three frets on your ukulele. Here are some examples of minor Thirds:

- [1](http://i.imgur.com/v0QPQ1b.jpg)
- [2](http://i.imgur.com/05g7oUq.jpg)
- [3](http://i.imgur.com/mWGgJjS.jpg)

&gt; the last example is a harmonic minor Third. If you were to add 2nd fret g string to those two notes, you'd have a d minor chord.  

The song I use for minor thirds is Brahms's Lullaby. If you don't know that one by name, then you know it by sound. It's the stereotypical lullaby song. 

**Major Third (M3)**

The second type of third, this interval is four half steps wide, or four frets on your ukulele. It is the distance between your C and your E strings. Here are some examples of Major Thirds:

- [1](http://i.imgur.com/g6npdpg.jpg)
- [2](http://i.imgur.com/LpT2k4k.jpg)
- [3](http://i.imgur.com/CmsFzcP.jpg)

&gt; the last example is a harmonic Major Third. I have no interesting facts about harmonic Major Thirds. If you were to add 3rd fret A string and open g string, you'd have a C major chord. I guess that's interesting. 

The song I use for Major Thirds is Kum Bah Yah. The first two notes form a Major Third. 

&gt;Bonus: What interval does the second and third notes form? If you said minor Third, you win a cookie! (offer valid at participating McDonalds)

Apologies for that.  I had forgotten the character limit on Reddit text posts.  Next week I will do a blog post or some alternate form.  You should probably read the comment titled **Wrapping Up** last.

**Introductions**

Please feel free to introduce yourselves in the comments.  Try not to out yourself; we don't want to know who you are IRL.  But tell us a little about you, your uke, your music interests.

A little about me: I teach at a University in the U.S.  I am NOT a music professor (and that will probably show), but I am an amateur musician.  I have played acoustic guitar and mandolin for a while now.  I started playing ukulele about 4 years ago, partly from interest, partly because of joint and tissue issues resulting from guitar, and partly because I became interested in the benefits of the high G tuning from a music theory standpoint.  Four years on, I would describe myself either as an intermediate player or as a rank beginner, depending on the day.  I am primarily a fingerstyle player, and dabble in lots of genres, but primarily American folk and Celtic music.

My uke collection is fairly modest (I have to care for and feed guitars and mandolins, too).  A couple of Lanakai ukes (a tenor cutaway and the Ovangkol 8 string) and a Kala soprano.  Pictures someday!

All my professor-iness has conditioned me to be comfortable with writing a lot to try to make my meaning more precise, and to be uncomfortable with hastiness (think Ents, the Tolkien kind and not the 420 kind).  So I write a lot.  That will be more and more apparent as you continue to read this post.

A request: if you happen to know who I am IRL or figure it out, please respect my Reddit anonymity."	t5_2qltz	True

1346086333.0	ywssb	Why the ukulele is my new favorite thing	DaisyCarbine	69	2	11	"After watching my little sister playing around with her uke, I decided I wanted to get one. I played around with some various ukes at a local shop (predictably falling in love with the solid wood ukes and therefore spending more money than I'd planned on).  I am now in the midst of a torrid affair with a Lanikai mahogany concert uke. The fingers on my left hand are bruised. I think my boyfriend is slightly jealous, but he cheers up when I serenade him.

So, without further ado, here are the reasons why I might like my uke more than my piano (which I have played for 20 years and utterly adore):

* It's way easier to learn uke well enough to not sound like shit. It took me almost an entire year to learn my way around a piano keyboard well enough so that the neighbors stopped complaining. It took me roughly 45 minutes to learn how to tune my uke and play songs in C major.
* It's much quieter than a piano. I can play ukulele whenever the hell I want, with no fear of waking anyone up, as long as I don't play it as loud as possible. This is a feat that can only be attained with a digital piano.
* It is tiny, and my tiny girl-hands can navigate it without issue or problem (I could never get my hands around a guitar neck, and playing octave chords on a piano forces me to take advantage of my double-jointed thumbs... by dislocating them every time I play an octave. The ukulele allows me to do what I want while keeping all my joints connected to each other.
* It is portable! I have to go to my piano if I want to play it. But this is a tiny box made of magic-infused wood, and *I can take it places.* Do I want to sing a song on the porch, or in the kitchen? No problem! Do I want to bring an instrument to the park? Hell yeah! Do I want to continue practicing while sitting on the toilet? As it turns out, no. No, I don't. But I know that as empirical fact, because *you can do that if you want to, even if your apartment's bathroom is the size of a coffin or an airplane bathroom.*

Rokittman	54	4	17	"I offered some homemade uke tabs to a fellow redditor recently and it seems that it stirred up quite an interest among the reddit community. So I'd like to offer these tabs ~ about 100 in all ~ to other ukulele enthusiasts who are interested in enlarging their library and learning some new music.


All of my tabs are from tablature sites, YouTube videos and some from my own creation. For the most part they are entirely accurate. But there may be a few in there I haven't quite finished. So you may have to do a little work with them. I'm a bit of a purist and tried whenever possible to save these tabs in the original tuning.


My only problem is that they are all in .doc format in a .rar archive and there is no way to post them here in an easy to download form. So, anyone interested can send me their email address and I'll forward it to you. Unless some smart redditor can show me how to host them online somewhere so anyone can get them at any time.

There are three files in the archive. A READ ME that explains what you have, A spreadsheet with an editable listing of all the music, and another .rar file that contains all the tabs. Total size? A whopping 348KB.


So, if someone can tell me how I can store this online and link it here, I'll create a new post with that link. Otherwise, feel free to message me here and I'll be happy to email the tabs. Keep strimmin'.

 - Dean

**CORRECTION:**

A fellow redditor brought it to my attention that I have been using the wrong terminology when referring to these as tabs. They are actually chord sheets. Whereas, the name of the chord is embedded into the song lyrics at the position that they are played. Here is an example of the format:

             
Happy [A] Birthday to [E] you. Happy [Dsus2] Birthday to [A] you.                 
Happy [A7] Birthday dear [D] reddit. Happy [A] Birthday [E] to [A] you.

You can download the .rar file at MediaFire here, or from the sidebar:
http://www.mediafire.com/download/ys2smvk8fp688n8/Ukulele_Tabs.rar



I apologize for this mistake. When I search the Net for song chords, I type in the song title followed by the word TABS. What is included in this collection is exactly what Google finds and how I have always referred to them. It may not be the proper terminology, but it appears to be the way that Internet categorizes them.

Again, I apologize for the confusion and hope you can get some enjoyment out of this work. I would love to hear your feedback and any suggestions I can use to make these better. I plan on posting more in the future when I can amass another large grouping. But doing these by hand does take time. If there is an easier way... I'm all ears.

Again, thank you for the interest and your support. Hope you all have fun with these.

* Dean

It's me again. I've decided to write some more guides on music theory topics as they apply to the ukulele. I plan on doing two chords guides, two (or three) scales guides, and one that explains how chords and scales combine to form key signatures. I'll most likely write them in this order:

- [Intervals pt. 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/ukulele/comments/1iulsn/intervals_for_ukulele_players/)
- Chords pt. 1
- Scales pt. 1
- Chords+Scales (key)
- Intervals pt. 2 (compound intervals!) 
- Scales pt. 2 (exotic scales!)
- Chords pt. 2 (shiny chords!)
- Scales pt. 3 (modes, if they're not in pt. 2) 


So expect new ones to come out whenever I have the time to write them out! If you have any suggestions/requests, let me know and I'll see what I can do. 

Please note that the Chords guides will be significantly more difficult to understand, as it is a complex topic. Do not be discouraged, even some of the college music students struggle with chords. The good news with chords is that once you begin to understand one part, the rest tends to follow shortly. 

Without further ado, I present my guide to chords, ukulele version!


--------

Introduction
-

A *chord* is defined as

&gt; a group of (typically three or more) notes sounded together, as a basis of harmony.

Basically, any two notes are considered an interval, but any more than that and you have a chord! That's the definition we will work with for this lesson. We will be learning about the four basic types of chords, as well as the common varieties of seventh chords. We will also learn how to aurally pick out these types of chords in a song, which will eventually help you figure out the chords to a song! This process combines knowledge of chords as well as scales, so you shouldn't expect to come out of this lesson able to do this at a high level (but you will be able to do it to some extent). 

Chords are more complicated of a topic than intervals, but I will try my darndest to make it easy to understand. If there is ever a point where the language might be very confusing, I will probably sum it up in simpler terms later on in the guide. If I don't let me know and I'll put it in! This guide will be broken into 3 main areas, each providing the information necessary to understand the next. They are: 

- Part 1: Chord Theory
- Part 2: The Common Types of Chords
- Part 3: How to Hear Chords


**What this guide will give you**

- A basic understanding of the common types of chords.
- How to hear the different types of chords. 
- A more advanced understanding of the way chords are built.
- An understanding of the terms *inversion* and *voicing*.
- The means to figure out how to play chords without looking them up.
- How to read common types of chord symbols


**What this guide will not give you**

- Understanding of the principles of voice leading.
- Instant knowledge of every chord on the ukulele.
- Knowledge of how chord progressions are built (that's coming later!) 
- A sexy beard. (though if you take long enough reading it, this guide may give you some sexy stubble, regardless of gender!)


**Prerequisite Knowledge**

You should know a few things before starting this lesson:

- How to read tablature
- Know the note names on the ukulele (if you don't, you can still take this lesson, it'll just take a bit longer to figure stuff out)
- Have a solid grasp on the basic 13 intervals, as well as one more that I will briefly cover here, but will be covered to a greater extent in my Intervals pt. 2 guide. (You can find my guide to the intervals [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ukulele/comments/1iulsn/intervals_for_ukulele_players/))


Being able to read music notation is not a requirement, I'll work in tablature for this lesson. However, we will be using a fair amount of note names for this, so being able to look at your uke and see where the notes are is a plus.

---------


Part 1: Chord Theory
- 

Chords use some of the same terminology as intervals, so beware! Though they are the same words, their use may differ a little, so make sure to keep them separate in your mind. There's also a few more basic terms that we will cover later on. (actually there are a lot of chord-related terms that can be quite confusing but no-one needs to know that now…)


**Building A Chord**

Before we can do fun things like inverting chords, we need to know what notes to include in the chord! This is called building a chord. A normal three-note chord is made by picking a note, playing the note a third above that one, and then playing the note a third above the second one. For seventh chords, you simply put another third above the highest note. It's kind of like building a tower by connecting lego blocks of different colors. 

&gt; Note: If you remember from the Intervals lesson, this is called *tertian harmony*.

Each note in a chord has a specific name, so that when you do crazy things like flip the notes of the chord around you can still tell what kind of chord it is. Of course there are more, but we will be dealing with these four in this lesson:

- Root
- Third
- Fifth
- Seventh

Let's take a look at an example chord to see how these terms apply! Start with the note C on your ukulele. Add the note a M3 above it (E). Add the note a m3 above the E (G). Finally add the note a m3 above the G (B-flat). You now have a C7 chord (we'll get to why later). 

&gt;If you're struggling finding those notes, here is the [tab!](http://i.imgur.com/qGI0trd.jpg). 

The order of our chord is now C E G B-flat. As you see, each note is a third apart. When a chord's order is like this (i.e., when each note is a third away from the next/previous one), you can start applying the terms! They go in the order listed above,from lowest note to the highest one, so that gives us this:

- Root: C
- Third: E
- Fifth: G
- Seventh: B-flat

&gt; Tip: if your chord isn't a seventh chord, it will usually not have a Seventh, only a Root, Third, and Fifth (more on that later)

Let's do another chord as an example. Start with D on your C string. Find a M3 above it (F#). Next find a m3 above the F# (A). Finally add a m3 above the A (C). You now have a D7 chord (again, we'll get to why later). 

&gt;If you're struggling finding those notes, here is the [tab!](http://i.imgur.com/oXoWt5b.jpg). 

Take a look at the order, from lowest to highest. Are the notes a third apart from each other? Yes they are! We can now apply our terms:

- Root: D
- Third: F#
- Fifth: A
- Seventh: C

Those of you who understand intervals really well might have noticed that the name of the chord member corresponds with the interval above the root it is. Notice that A is a Fifth above D, C is a seventh above D, and F# is a third above D. This allows us to name chords with only two pieces of information:

- The Root
- Which notes are in the chord

Let's try an example. The root of your chord is A. Your chord includes the notes C E G and A. Here's the process you should use to identify this chord. 

- What is my root? It's A.
- Which notes am I using? C, E, G, and A.  
- What note is a third above A? C. 
- What note is a fifth above A? E. 
- What note is a seventh above A? G. 

Therefore, you get:

- Root: A
- Third: C
- Fifth: E
- Seventh: G

Notice that they are now lined up by thirds! If you had trouble following this process, you should review your intervals. 

I'll provide some examples now for you to figure out. 

- Root: E,  Notes: B, D, G#, E  - [Answer](http://i.imgur.com/aqjwChg.jpg)
- Root: F,  Notes: F, C, E-flat, A  - [Answer](http://i.imgur.com/hMG8g9C.jpg)
- Root: C,  Notes: B-flat, G, C, E  - [Answer](http://i.imgur.com/ojt1M8p.jpg)
- Root: B,  Notes: B, A, F#, D  - [Answer](http://i.imgur.com/fHHOgeq.jpg)

Remember, if a particular interval doesn't exist from the root (oh, let's say the seventh, as an example), then there is not that particular chord member in the chord. Here are some examples with only three note chords (but I'll double notes, as if they were played on the ukulele): 

- Root: C, Notes: C, G, C, B-flat - [Answer](http://i.imgur.com/ZTx94By.jpg)
- Root: A, Notes: C, A, A, E - [Answer](http://i.imgur.com/kOaQuHY.jpg)
- Root: G, Notes: B, D, D, G - [Answer](http://i.imgur.com/Czh0AUV.jpg)
- Root: E, Notes: E, G#, G#, D - [Answer](http://i.imgur.com/pDh9zCI.jpg)

&gt; Yes, you can leave out chord members and still have a chord, I'll go over what to call them in a different lesson, most likely Chords pt. 2. 

**Identifying the Chord Members of a Chord That You Already Know How To Play**

Right now you have the skills to name the parts of a chord if you know the Root and which notes make up the chord. If you knew how to discern the Root given just what notes your chord is, you would be able to name the members of that Chord. This is important because later on in this lesson I will show you how to name a chord based on that information! 

The key to identifying the Root lies in being able to put a collection of notes into order so that they are thirds apart. At first this will take some trial and error, but eventually you will be able to look at what notes you have and know what chord it is. 

&gt;Likewise, you will also eventually be able to look at a chord symbol and know what notes *should* be there. This information will allow you to construct your own chords without using a chord chart!

Let's try one! Here are your notes: G, B-flat, E, and C. Your first instinct might be to order them from lowest to highest: B-flat, C, E, G. While your top three pitches are good, the B-flat is only a Second away from C, instead of a Third. If you put the B-flat above the G, it becomes a Third and you now have your pitches in the correct order! Your root would be C.  

Here's another example, this time with only three notes: C, F, A. If you put them in the order F, A, C, and said that the Root is F, that's great! 

Think of any basic chord that you know (any one that you learned within the first few weeks of playing will do). Play it on your uke. Next, figure out which notes it is made up of. Now, figure out the root. Lather, Rinse, and Repeat. 

&gt; If you were unable to arrange the notes so that they were thirds apart, your chord might just be a complex chord, which will be covered in Chords pt. 2. 

**Interlude**

We only have a few more topics related to Chord Theory left to go! These final few concepts are the most tricky to learn, but will make the biggest impact on your ukulele playing. Before we start, though, let's take a break. If you won a cookie during the Intervals guide, you can eat it now.  

[Here's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzY3wYPZQnU) a nice, relaxing song to listen to while you read this section. 

Here's a summary of what you've learned so far:

- Chords contain three or more notes
- Chords are (most often) based on stacking thirds
- The notes that make up chords have specific names based on their relation to the root
- By ordering a selection of notes so that they are thirds away from each other, you can then name the root, and thus, the other chord members of that chord. 
- You can leave out members of a chord and still have a chord. You don't know what to call it yet, but you know that you can do it. 
- Likewise, you can double members of a chord and still have a chord. This is very common with the re-entrant tuning of ukuleles. 

Here's a list of reasons why you are a pretty cool person:

- You play the ukulele
- You want to better your musical knowledge to be the best player you can be
- You own several shirts

Here's a list of the last few things you'll learn in this section:

- The difference between the Root of a chord and the *bass note* of the chord
- Just what the heck is an inversion and why do I care?
- How can I use different chord voicings to spice up my playing?

1348982655.0	10p8bj	Aloha guys! Ryan from Ukulele Underground here. We want to give out some copies of our brand new DVD to beginners if you're serious about learning the uke.	esaks	43	2	55	"Hey guys, [Ryan](http://ukuleleunderground.com/about/) from ukuleleunderground.com here (the skinny guy in the middle). 

It's always been our mission at UU to grow the next generation of ukulele players throughout the world. To us it's important, not just because playing the uke is fun, but also because the uke is such a phenomenal way to get started in music and playing music is good for everybody. 

We put a lot of though into creating what we think is the best way to get people started with music in this day and age. What we came up with was this [DVD](http://ukeunderground.bigcartel.com/product/the-ultimate-beginner-dvd-for-ukulele). We crammed it full of useful tips and tools that every beginner should learn to get started and even created some extra downloadable DVD owner exclusive content. 

I've been lurking this subreddit for a while and see that there are many folks here who are excited and just getting into music for the first time with the uke and I think its awesome.

So here's the deal. We'll give away 10 copies of this brand new beginner DVD to 10 people who truly consider themselves a real uke beginner free of charge to help you with your musical journey. I'm talking real beginners here only please, i.e. you're super excited but  Am7 is the only chord you can hold and strum well (and you probably don't get this joke).

Hopefully this DVD can help you and maybe one day you can give it to someone else to help them get started on their uke playing adventure.

I'm not quite sure how to decide who gets them, maybe you guys can just leave a comment with where you currently are with your playing and people can upvote those who really sound like they could use it. I'm shooting for 10 deserving people.

Aloha, 
Ryan &amp; the rest of the UU guys.

**TL;DR: If you're a true uke beginner, I'll give you a copy of our new beginner DVD for free. Post a comment below to be chosen.**

Edit: I'll be back on tomorrow to check the comments. I'll PM the people who we will be sending the DVDs to.  Mahalo &amp; Aloha!

Edit 2: Wow such great response! I have the 10 people I want to give this to. If I didn't choose you, please don't be offended, it's honestly because a lot of you seem like you've done a good job learning on your own. This DVD is for the extreme beginner, people who really know next to nothing about the uke, so if you're already playing songs, this will be too simple for you. You can probably learn more from just watching the videos we have on ukuleleunderground.com.

Congrats to the peeps chosen. I'll be PM'ing directions to you. Aloha.

Share some good general advice on this thread.  Link to a uke that you think is really good for starters (or one to be avoided).  Name some songs that are  friendly to the new musician.

Primarily this involves inventing new ways to sit in the sun, play music, and drink beer while at the same time assuring our spouses that the children we are supposed to be watching are safe.

I hope folks found week 1 useful.  It would be great to see some recordings or discussions posted in the threads (hint, hint).

This week, let's look at the remainder of the C chord family, mechanical up-down strums, the C scale and how to practice it, and two songs.  Throughout the week, you should keep coming back to material from practice session 1 occasionally, **and not just the songs**.  Practice the chords and their transitions from week 1 and week 2.  Practice the strum patterns from week 1.  The idea is to continually incorporate, not to move on.

Looking ahead to week three, I'll plan to break out of the C chord family and talk about 7th chords and the twelve bar blues format.  As songs, I'd like to take a look at Jace Everett's *Bad Things* (the theme to *True Blood* on HBO), Dylan's *Don't Think Twice, It's Alright*, and something very traditionally bluesy."	t5_2qltz	True

1329552347.0	pv1vv	Finger Picking Tutorial 	ukulelecanadian	30	4	10	"This week I had a request from a friend about how to finger pick properly. So i figured I would post a simple Ukulele finger-picking technique along with some tips and tricks to make your picking faster and sound better too.

The beautiful thing about the Ukulele is that it only has four strings. This makes it really easy to begin playing, and although it can make some difficult progressions on guitar nearly impossible on the ukulele, for the most part, four strings is a good thing. Especially if your trying to learn how to pick.

  **The Simple Pattern:**
The pattern your going to learn is the 1-4-2-3 pattern, and the simplicity of this one is going to blow your mind. But first things first. You're going to want to drop your right hand (assuming your right handed) down directly  above the sound hole. This is really where it should be anyways, but many Ukulele players tend to strum higher up on the fret board because of the small size of the instrument.  This will help you pick at the strings more easily because the strings are farther away from the ukulele here. Your left hand will be making chords of course, just like it would be if you were strumming.

The thing to remember with the Ukulele is that the strings are numbered from the bottom up, so the smallest (bottom) string is number 1, the next largest is number 2, and so on. 
With the 1-4-2-3 pattern you will pluck the strings in the order of the pattern to complete it.
 This is the case with all picking patterns and learning this now will help you a lot if you ever want to read and play Ukulele tabs in the future. 

For most picking patterns you will only need your first three fingers and as a general rule, your thumb owns the top two (G and C), your pointer finger will pick the next one down  (E), and your middle finger will pick the bottom string (A). I usually float my ring finger in the air and let it wiggle around how it likes while I pick, and my pinky finger tends to push down against my uke for support, but this is really just my personal preference and you may do it however it is comfortable. 


If your playing the 1-4-2-3 pattern properly while the ukulele is open (no chord is being made)  you should be playing the strings in this order A-G-E-C. This wont sound pretty without a chord to pick, so a simple C chord is fine for learning.  Once the pattern is complete you just repeat it to sound the chord. To pick the chords of a normal song, you would change the chords of the song just like if you were strumming, and maintain the picking pattern with your fingers.


Put very simply, To play the 1-4-2-3 pattern, start by plucking the bottom string with your middle finger, then pluck the top string with your thumb, pluck the second string from the bottom with your pointer, and  finish by plucking the third string from the bottom with your thumb to end it. Repeat as necessary 

 Okay, I know your not going to want to hear this, but the most important thing to need to remember in order to get good at picking is to practice, practice, practice. Simply picking slowly while you watch some TV, or setting aside twenty minutes or so for practicing a day will help your speed tremendously, and if you get frustrated, just play something else, and come back to it later.

So I put this together.  Feel free to pick it apart, add, subtract, ridicule, whatever.  Mods, feel free to use it or not.

**Are there different kinds of ukuleles?**

Yes there are!  In approximate order from smallest to largest, there's soprano (most common), concert, tenor, and baritone.  The first three typically use the same standard tuning (GCEA) and the baritone is usually tuned differently (DGBE).  There are also other types like the banjolele (banjo ukulele), the cavaquinho (arguable granddaddy of the ukulele), and the harp ukulele.

**What kind of ukulele should I get?**

Judging preferences between sizes is a personal thing.  Some like the small size and portability of a soprano, while others find the slightly larger fretboard of a concert or tenor more comfortable.  Try one on for size at your local music store.

**What brand of ukulele should I get?**

This is a hotly contested topic.  Some common brands for beginners are Kala, Oscar Schmidt, and Mahalo.  They each have reasonably-priced ($50-100), good sounding ukes that are ideal for new ukers who don't want to make a large investment at the outset.

**Why does my uke go out of tune so often?**

If you have a new ukulele (or new strings), they will go out of tune frequently for a while until they ""break in"".  This can be frustrating for new players, but take heart!  Eventually your ukulele will stay pretty close to in tune and will require only occasional tweaks.

If your uke won't hold a tune at all, make sure your pegs are tight.  Geared pegs are often delivered a little loose - a little love with a screwdriver can usually take care of this.


**How do I tune my ukulele?**

There are several excellent online and offline resources that can help with tuning.

*PC Tuner*

[Audio Tuner](http://www.supernifty.com.au/wiki/index.php?title=Audio_Tuner)

*Online tuners*

http://ukulelehunt.com/2008/04/10/ukulele-tuning-notes/

http://www.seventhstring.com/tuner/tuner.html

http://www.tunerr.com/

http://www.buraks.com/tuner/

http://www.proguitartuner.com/

*Tuning Apps*

[gStrings for Android](https://market.android.com/details?id=org.cohortor.gstrings&amp;hl=en)

Or you can get a clip-on chromatic tuner at the same time you buy your uke. :)


**What are some good online resources for beginners?**

Look to your right. :)  For those not wanting to turn their heads: 

[Ukulele Underground](http://ukuleleunderground.com) - A very active uke forum with great video lessons

[Ukulele Hunt](http://ukulelehunt.com/) - A great resource for lessons, guides, reviews, tabs, and news

[Ukulele Tabs](http://www.ukulele-tabs.com/) - Uke tabs galore!

[Ultimate Guitar](http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/) - Guitar-centric, but they have a huge database of chord charts (which can't be shut down by the RIAA!), and many of the lessons and guides are applicable to ukulele

[Chordie](http://www.chordie.com/) - Transposable chord charts


**What are some good offline resources for beginners?**

Most major cities have ukulele clubs - Google it!  Also, most music stores that offer guitar lessons will have someone who can teach ukulele - give them a call.

**What songs should I learn to play?**

Somewhere Over the Rainbow is a common first song - the chords are fairly simple and it's almost universally appealing.  The key is to find music you want to play and hunt down music for it.  Learn those chords and play and sing!  Playing music you love will drive you to practice a lot more than a simpler tune that you're not fond of.

**What is UAS and how can it be cured?**

UAS stands for Ukulele Acquisition Syndrome - the burning desire to get another uke in a different tone, shape, or size.  When you find a cure, let me know.

These are widely considered to be serious instrumental tools for creation. I picked up my first ukulele some years ago and quickly became attached to the positive charm of this fantastic instrument (I need not go into the sheer brilliance of this incredible instrument —  you most likely already know). 

It wasn't long after learning to play this instrument that I realized most people look at the ukulele as a gimmick, a toy, something ""meta or sub -instrumental"". I found this to be terribly disappointing.  I've run across people who ask me things like: ""Oh you play the ukulele! Do you hula-hoop and surf? Do you ride a unicycle? Can you juggle?"" -- I feel this is a common disposition. The ukulele is viewed as a novelty act, not a legitimate instrument. This concerns me. While I rarely give half a shit what other people think in regard to most benign matters, I really do find this as annoying as a kick in the shin.  The ukulele is legitimate.

All I'm saying is: The uke is an instrument, not a gimmick, a toy, or an accessory. Let's be musicians when playing the uke and let everything else follow."	t5_2qltz	True

Being what I guess you could call a busty lady, it seems absolutely impossible to hold it high across my chest and cradle it in my elbow. If I try to rest it above my chest, it is hitting me in the chin. I've given up on the ""proper"" form and started holding it lower like a guitar, but then it is too low to fit in my elbow and I can't play standing. Anyone else experience this issue? Should I give in and go get strap buttons?

When I saw that the song was in E, I started to look for transpositions.

Being a lazy musician, I din't feel like transposing it myself and since I came up short on the net, I nearly just gave up on the song.

As I was listening to his very well done arrangement, I decided I better learn that devil of chords that I had been avoiding for years.

 After trying for a few moments, I just couldn't get the 'standard' fingering of the chord.

 I then found [this site](http://ukulelehunt.com/2009/04/22/e-chord-ukulele/) with alternative fingerings for E major.

Within a few moments I got it down (I used the second one on the site) and preceded to learn my song.

 Thank you to /u/TheUkuleleHero for the inspiration and thank you to Woodshed from UkuleleUnderground.com for such a valuable resource.


tl:dr Learned the E major chord today after years of avoidance.

Moral: If there is a song you want to play bad enough, you will jump through hoops to learn it. Don't avoid those chords!"	t5_2qltz	True

1321564313.0	mg3x2	The moment I knew the Ukulele was the gateway to peace (kinda long story)	nero104	28	4	9	"Ever since I was a little kid, music has been a major part of my life and I have always believed that music has some sort of universal quality to it. I started playing piano when I was 7, and since then I have picked up the harmonica, electric bass, upright bass, guitar and the glockenspiel. Last year, I received a ukulele from my mom because she heard me complaining about how my guitar isn't ""travel sized"" enough. From that moment on, I was hooked. 
 
I bring that ukulele everywhere, including when I travel.

This summer, I went on a teen tour in Israel. I thought that it would be a good idea to have some sort of musical accompaniment for those long plane rides, desert camp outs etc.

One weekend, we were chilling in a youth hostel near Tel-Aviv. There were two groups of students there: My group, all Americans, and a group of Arab school children who lived in the southern part of the country and were there for a field trip. The whole time we were there, my friends and I were harassed. A kid almost tripped me when I was walking down a staircase and my friend was hit in the head with multiple rocks. 

During the first night, I contracted a 104 degree fever, and was instructed to sit out on the next day's activities and to stay in my room the whole day. After watching some tv and sleeping for a couple of hours, I decided that it would calm me to go outside onto my room's balcony and tool around with my ukulele.

The balcony to my room was about 6 or 7 feet above the ground, and looked over a courtyard that was in the center of all of the rooms. While I was playing, a little Arab kid walked by, stopped, and watched me play around for a few minutes. He then walked away as if nothing happened. A few minutes later, the kid came back with a group of 15 or so Arab children, one of whom I could identify as the kid who tried to push me down the stairs. They all sat down in a semi-circle and watched me play for a while. 

The next thing that happened almost moved me to tears. I started playing Imagine by John Lennon, and all the children joined in with me. They sang along with me the whole entire time, and when I finished, they gave me a standing ovation.

It was at that moment that I realized that the power of music can break all forms of hatred and can bring people together. One of my Ukulele heroes, Jake Shimabukuro, once said, “if everyone played the ukulele, the world would be a better place.” That experience 100% confirmed that belief. I thought that this subreddit would be the best place for me to share this story. Keep on strumming guys!"	t5_2qltz	True

1. All entries must be submitted as a reply to this thread.

2. Voting ends 7/26. The winner will be the top comment at the time voting ends.

3. You can submit recordings that were done before the start of the contest, or even one you've already posted to this subreddit, as long as it hasn't been used in a previous challenge

4. You can submit up to 2 recordings, posted as separate comments

5. You can use any instruments in addition to the ukulele. You don't even have to use an ukulele- I'd allow something sufficiently uke-like such as a charango or a cuatro venezolano. Just remember that your uke (or uke substitute) must feature prominently in the song. I'll leave it up to the voters to decide how big a role it has to play.

6. Please don't downvote legitimate submissions. Different people are at different skill levels. If you think someone sucks, tell them how they could improve.

Oh yeah, Here are the rules:

1.    All entries must be submitted as a reply to this thread.

2.    Voting ends 8/10. The winner will be the top comment at the time voting ends.

3.    You can submit recordings that were done before the start of the contest, or even one you've already posted to this subreddit, as long as it hasn't been used in a previous challenge.

4.    You can submit up to 2 recordings, posted as separate comments.

5.    You can use any instruments in addition to the ukulele. You don't even have to use an ukulele- I'd allow something sufficiently uke-like such as a charango or a cuatro venezolano. Just remember that your uke (or uke substitute) must feature prominently in the song. I'll leave it up to the voters to decide how big a role it has to play.

8.   Please don't downvote legitimate submissions. Different people are at different skill levels. If you think someone sucks, tell them how they could improve.

Basic blues forms, styles, and chords are an integral part of a huge amount of pop music today.  Knowing how to bang out a 12 bar blues is practically a requirement.

This week, material includes the 12 bar blues form, 7th chords, the 5-6-7 shuffle pattern for the blues, a little about playing scales over chords, and three songs that use 7th chords and/or blues ideas: Dylan's *Don't Think Twice It's All Right*, Jace Everett's *Bad Things* (the *True Blood* theme song), and the classic *Malted Milk* by Robert Johnson.

This is probably a *lot* to absorb in a week.  Keep coming back to this practice session, as well as sessions 1 and 2.  Next week we'll take a break from the theory and technique and focus on a few songs instead, all with the word *black* in the title... The Black Session?"	t5_2qltz	True

The Rules:

1. All entries must be submitted as a reply to this thread.  

2. Voting ends Friday, March 22.  The winner will be the top comment at the time voting ends.

3. You can use any instruments in addition to the ukulele.  You don't even have to use an ukulele- I'd allow something sufficiently uke-like such as a charango or a cuatro venezolano.  Just remember that your uke (or uke substitute) must feature prominently in the song.  I'll leave it up to the voters to decide how big a role it has to play.

4. It would be impossible to actually enforce rules about voting, but please don't downvote legitimate submissions.  Different people are at different skill levels.  If you think someone sucks, tell them how they could improve.

5. Don't forget to leave feedback on people's submissions!

Iamnotyour_mother	18	1	12	"So, a little semi-relevant back story; I'm a classically trained flutist, been playing since I was a wee one. I've been stuck in sheet music-land for my entire music career, and one of the reasons I decided to pick up a ukulele was to help get myself out of that, which has been successful to an extent. 

I started teaching myself by learning the basic chords, and figuring out how to sing and play at the same time. I can play just about any song that involves chords/strumming. When it comes to fingerpicking, I am totally lost. Reading tabs is... very challenging, given that reading sheet music is second nature for me. I understand the concept, but doing it in action is like learning to read sheet music all over again. I haven't had much luck finding sheet music written for the ukulele, at least not something I'm interested in spending time playing.

So r/ukulele, I seek your advice. How the hell do I teach myself fingerpicking, from the ground up?

1352616563.0	1301ga	Unfortunate update on the Kapono uke...	JoeKthefirst	18	1	4	"So last week I posted pictures of an uke I bought, a very pretty eight-string pineapple. The day after I got it, I noticed the strings were fairly high. When I brought it into the same store to get them adjusted, the repair worker (who apparently did not know I had bought it from the store) took a look at it and said ""This uke is in really bad shape. You're going to want to try to get your money back from whoever scammed you on this one.""

Apparently, the uke was made with really thin wood and insufficient support. It was bowing between the sound hole and the bridge, something which I probably should have noticed right off the bat. I took it to a few other repair guys around town, who all confirmed my worst fears; my uke was cooked. 

Very sad. I was really liking the sound, but for the price I had paid I didn't feel it wasn't worth keeping if it wasn't going to last. The store was gracious enough when I told them what their own repair guy had said and took it back. 

I'm not trying to say Kapono is a bad brand if someone comes across another one out there. This one may have been a fluke. For all I know their typical 4 string ukes could be well made. Unfortunately, my experience was a negative one. Anyway, I'm sorry this is a long post. I'm just upset it didn't work out.

TLDR; Kapono uke wasn't built very well, decided to return it. Just gives me an excuse to keep looking for another uke."	t5_2qltz	True

I purchased a set of the Red series (low G for tenor) strings and got them installed. I let them stretch for a day with the occasional re-tune, then the next day I sat down to play with them. They sounded *fantastic*.

I got about one and a half songs into my practice, playing around with hammer ons and the low G string broke, right at the tuning peg. After some research I found out that this is turning into a common complaint. I was about to write it off and just drop the $1.50 and go buy a new low G when I decided to send them an email.

I found the customer service address on their web site and wrote them a nice note letting them know about the issue and that other people were having the same problem. I assured them that I intended to continue purchasing their product and was wondering if they had heard about this problem and, if so, if they were planning on addressing it.

I was impressed that I got a response back (granted in broken English) and they asked me to watch the youtube video on how to install them. I wrote back detailing the process that I used and I got an almost immediate response back asking for my address so that they could ship me a new set of strings.

I know it's a small thing, but I have been impressed with this small company for a while now. They don't handle retail sales themselves and to have them take ownership of the issue like this instead of asking me to contact my retailer (which is what I was expecting and would have been fine with) really makes me happy.

I just wanted to let you all know about my experience. I worked in customer service for the first chunk of my adult life so I like to go out of my way to let people know when I have been treated great."	t5_2qltz	True

    Gm F A Dm C
    
    Little porcelain figurines, glass bullets you shoot at the wall.
    Threats of castration for crimes you imagine when I miss your call.
    
             Dm4                       Gm         Am
    With the bite of the teeth of that ring on my finger,
        G2-3                        G2sus4
    I'm bound to your bedside, your eulogy singer.
        Dm4                    Gm                     Am                    G2-3 G2sus4
    I'd happily take all those bullets inside you and put them inside of my self.
    Someone, oh anyone, tell me how to stop this.
    She's screaming, expiring and I'm her only witness.
    I'm freezing, infected, and rigid in that room inside her.
    No one's gonna come as long as I lay still in bed beside her.

              C               Em
    There's a bear inside your stomach
                   F                  C
    The cub's been kicking from within.
         A                    Dm 
    He's loud, though without vocal chords
          F             G
    We'll put an end to him
    
    We'll make all the right appointments
    No one ever has to know.
    And then tomorrow I'll turn 21
    We'll script another show
    
    We'll play charades up in the Chelsea
    Drink champagne although you shouldn't be.
    We'll be blind and dumb until we fall asleep
    
    None of our friends will come
    They dodge our calls.
    And they have for quite a while now
               F
    It's not a shock
                                                G
    You don't seem to mind and I just can't see how.

              F     Em
    We're too old
              Dm          G
    We're not old, old at all            
    Just too old
    We're not old, old at all
    
    There's a bear inside your stomach
    The cub's been kicking you for weeks
    And if this isn't all a dream
    Well then we'll cut him from beneath
    
    Well we're not scared of making caves
    Or finding food for him to eat
    We're terrified of one another
    And terrified of what that means 
    
    But we'll make only quick decisions
    And you'll just keep my in the waiting room
    And all the while I'll know we're fucked
    And not getting unfucked soon
    
    When we get home we're bigger strangers 
    than we've ever been before
               Am             Dm          F               G
    You sit in front of snowy television, suitcase on the floor
    
    We're too old
    But we're not old, old at all
    Just too old
    But we're not old, old at all

    A                                                 Asus2
    In the middle of the night I was sleeping sitting up,
    A                               Asus2
    when a doctor came to tell me, ""Enough is enough.""
    Bm9                                                        
    He brought me out into the hall (I could have sworn it was haunted),
    Bm9
    and told me something that I didn't know that I wanted to hear:
    That there was nothing that I could do to save you,
    the choir's gonna sing, and this thing is gonna kill you.
    Something in my throat made my next words shake,
    and something in the wires made the lightbulbs break.
    There was glass inside my feet and raining down from the ceiling,
    it opened up the scars that had just finished healing.
    It tore apart the canyon running down your femur,
    (I thougth that it was beautiful, it made me a believer.)
    And as it opened I could hear you howling from your room,
    but I hid out in the hall until the hurricane blew.
    When I reappered and tried to give you something for the pain,
    you came to hating me again and just sang your refrain:
    
    You had a new dream, it was more like a nightmare.
    You were just a little kid, and they cut your hair,
    then they stuck you in machines, you came so close to dying.
    They should have listened, they thought that you were lying.
    Daddy was an asshole, he fucked you up, built the gears in your head,
    now he greases them up. And no one paid attention when you just stopped eating. 
    pounds!"" and this all bears repeating.
    
    Tell me when you think that we became so unhappy,
    wearing silver rings with nobody clapping.
    When we moved here togehter we were so dissappointed,
    sleeping out of tune with our dreams disjointed.
    It killed me to see you getting always rejected,
    but I didn't mind the things you threw, the phones I deflected.
    I didn't mind you blaming me for your mistakes,
    I just held you in the doorframe through all of the earthquakes.
    But you packed up your clothes in that bag every night,
    and I would try to grab your ankles (what a pitiful sight.)
    But after over a year, I stopped trying to stop you from stomping out that door,
    coming back like you always do.
    Well no one's gonna fix it for us, no one can.
    You say that, 'No one's gonna listen, and no one understands.'
    So there's no open doors and there's no way to get through,
    there's no other witnesses, just us two.
    There's two people living in one small room,
    from your two half-families tearing at you,
    two ways to tell the story (no one worries),
    two silver rings on our fingers in a hurry,
    two people talking inside your brain,
    two people believing that I'm the one to blame,
    two different voices coming out of your mouth,
    too cold to care and too sick to shout.
    
    You had a new dream, it was more like a nightmare.
    You were just a little kid, and they cut your hair,
    then they stuck you in machines, you came so close to dying.
    They should have listened, they thought that you were lying.
    Daddy was an asshole, he fucked you up, built the gears in your head,
    now he greases them up. And no one paid attention when you just stopped eating.

    Em       D          C               G      
    Suddenly every machine stopped at once
               C        G             D
    And the monitors beeped the last time
    Hundreds of thousands of hospital beds
    And all of them empty but mine
    Well, I was lying down with my feet in the air
    Completely unable to move
    The bed was misshaped, and awkward and tall
    And clearly intended for you
    You checked yourself out when you put me to bed
    And tore that old band off your wrist
    But you came back to see me for a minute or less
    And left me your ring in my fist
    My hair started growing, my face became yours
    My femur was breaking in half
    The sensation was scissors and too much to scream
    So instead, I just started to laugh
    Suddenly every machine stopped at once
    And the monitors beeped the last time
    Hundreds of thousands of hospital beds
    And all of them empty but mine

It's a South American instrument that has 10 strings. It's sort of like what would happen if a mandolin and a ukulele hooked up in the Andes and had a baby. However, the strings are doubled-up, and the instrument is tuned almost exactly like a ukulele, only with an extra high e (so the tuning is G, C, E, A, E). I just thought you ukulele players would like to know that there's another instrument out there that you could pretty much pick up and play right away!

If you want to know how it sounds (strap in for some shameless self promotion), here's [a poor quality video of me doing a cover of Hell is Chrome by Wilco](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh8FTl3LxBc), here's [my friend covering Sense, Sensibility by Andrew Jackson Jihad](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxZgWwlK7Xo&amp;feature=channel_video_title), and here's [both of us playing Home by Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzAD4lqxpPQ&amp;feature=channel_video_title) (although we only have one charango for that). There are, however, plenty of youtube videos of people playing things on the charango other than bad covers of American songs. 



Also, apparently there was a documentary made about the charango. [ Here's a clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIlzt8TzbLQ).

As always, when searching for instruction, I started at YouTube. There I stumbled on a Jake Shimabukuro video on advanced technique. He was wonderful, but the martial was, Erm, beyond me. So I did a google search looking for more from him and found an app called On The Music Path.

The app has a number of well known artists giving lessons, but also has a 72 min lesson from Jake. Naturally, it's not free. But $14.99, and a little over an hour later, I feel quite satisfied with my purchase. His lesson has something for both n00bs and advanced players. Plus, the app is really well designed.

Www.onthepathapp.com and you can watch Jeff Daniel's intro into the apps features. Really neat stuff.

1344632240.0	y0lc5	Why I Chose the Ukulele.	thebarrelmonkey	16	2	20	"So recently I picked up my first beautiful ukulele; a Kala KA-S. Since picking it up I've been getting the question ""Why the ukulele?"" a lot. When it comes down to it, I didn't think anyone would ask me that question. I suppose to myself it would seem like someone would just shrug and say ""Oh, hey, that's cool!"" But I seemed to be met with people's curiosity. The question wasn't negative by any means but people seemed to raise their brows at me wondering why I decided upon learning the uke.

So I've given this question a lot of thought. Why did I choose it? I've been singing since I could remember and played piano and flute since I was very young. I loved to sing and still do, and I enjoyed playing the flute but wasn't that great at it. When I first tried piano, I realized I didn't really enjoy it as much as I thought I would have... possibly because my parents really tried to encourage me into it like good Asian parents. For a while though, I didn't have anything to play. I just sang and I admit that it felt empty. Music's always been a big part of my life but it's been years since I've been in a performance or been practicing something. 

Music was my therapy for a very long time. I've been in a slump for a number of reasons. I moved away from home to attend school and I've been homesick and miss my dogs. School was hard on me financially and my sub-par coffee shop job was only letting me scrape by. I needed something to lift my spirits.

So I bought an ukulele.

I wasn't sure what I was looking for but I walked into a music store in town and was looking around. It turned out a friend of mine worked there and he was showing me a few things. He strummed an uke and taught me a chord and I fell in love. This tiny thing I held was the most happiest and honest instrument I had ever had the pleasure of holding in my hand. I felt whole.

So I left with it in my hands and named him Gatsby.

**TL;DR** I was feeling ucky and found a newfound love in the ukulele. 

And so I ask you this question my friends in /r/ukulele ...Why did you choose the uke?"	t5_2qltz	True

I watched several video tutorials so I'd do it right. My guitar player BF came over and helped. It wasn't as hard as I was making it out to be.

But now it sounds awful. The cheap strings on it (Kala Makala) made it sound really sort of goofy and happy. I got Aquila uke strings and strung them in the right order (gcea), and then tuned it. I've tuned it several times a day since I restrung it.

It just sounds awful. Why? Did I do something wrong? I only know the C chord and F chord comfortably so far, and my strumming technique is really clumsy, but compared to the happy noises it made before... it's just sad.

I feel depressed. Is this some novice mistake I made somewhere? Should I have paid more attention to the knots on the bridge? Done a professional over-under technique on the pegs? Please help me. :("	t5_2qltz	True

Even if I practice constantly (and I now work from home, so I play it often throughout the day) I still find I have these major problems:

* if I'm finger picking I find it really hard to only hit one string
* when strumming I find my hand catches on the strings a lot, especially the G
* I feel like I have poor control over my fretting hand: I ham up notes constantly, find it hard to do stuff like hammer-ons, and often end up with buzzing or muted notes.
* not that I have a great voice anyway, but I can't play and sing together. My mind just can't seem to keep track of the two different things.
* EDIT: Oh, and I still have trouble holding the damn thing. I'm a reasonably big guy but without any significant squidgy bits to hold it in place. I can only really hold it if I put my right leg up on something.

I think I have [stupid hands](http://i.imgur.com/ywHLo.png). But most of my other hobbies involve dexterity (such as woodcarving) and I do alright at those.

Have any of you had the same problems? Any tips on how I can improve my playing?

1360971311.0	18lxo4	Beginner trouble - holding uke while changing chords	kcrobinson	14	1	6	"Hi everyone. I've only been playing the ukulele for a week and a few days. This subreddit and the sidebar links have been great. I feel like I'm making really wonderful progress. However, I'm having trouble with chord changing that I have yet to see addressed in any videos or tutorials yet.

When I first started playing, I was lightly strumming with my thumb while I worked on fret fingering of chords. As I started wanting to up strumming, the tutorial videos had me start using an index finger. However, this changed how I held my ukulele. While strumming with my thumb, my other fingers could hold up the uke. If I'm strumming with my finger, it takes my whole wrist and I can no longer hold up the uke with my hand. Instead, I need to support it by holding it against my body with my forearm. The problem is that this isn't as stable as using my hand, so now when I try to change chords, the ukulele shifts as I let up on one chord so it is much much harder to for my fret fingers to find the next chord. 

For example, no matter how much I try or how slow I go, I can never hit an E minor chord while coming from a C major chord. I let go and before I can place my hand back down, the uke has moved too much for me to recover. On the other hand, it's much easier to go between a C major and a G7 chord because my fret hand can continue to hold the neck while my fingers move.

I hope I adequately explained my problem such that other people can relate. Am I doing something wrong while holding my uke? Is there a better way? Or is this just something that magically gets easier with practice?

TL;DR - How do I hold the ukulele stable enough while changing chords?

**Edit:** Thanks to everyone for your answers. I realized from listening to your comments that I *must* be holding the uke wrong. Otherwise, someone would be bound to have the same extreme difficulty as me. So I spent some time analyzing how I was holding it and how it moved after while changing chords. What happened was that when I would let go of a chord, the neck would pop out away from me. I have been holding the uke against my body with my forearm, but holding it such that the center of gravity was to my side. So when my arm held it against me, the natural place for the neck to be was protruding out in front of me. I had been using my fret hand to hold the neck close to me and that's why I was having such trouble keeping it from moving.

I am assuming from all of this that the correct place to hold the uke is more with the center of the body in the center of your body. I have been trying this with a lot of success. It feels a little awkward, but now when I let go of a chord, the neck doesn't spring away from me."	t5_2qltz	True

After careful deliberation with [my most trusted advisors](http://blog.lib.umn.edu/reife014/myblog2/Alcohol.jpg), I have made [/r/ukulele](/r/ukulele) an official ally of [/r/banana](/r/banana) and the [Fruit Union](/r/FRUITUNION) in their righteous war against the pickles.  For too long, the atrocities committed by the pickles and their allies have gone unpunished.  Those foulest of preserved vegetables lay on plates the world over, (MENACINGLY!) and make fries, chips, sandwiches, and any other food they touch taste kind of funky, but you can never remember to ask for no pickles when you order and you have to find someone who actually likes pickles because you feel bad about wasting food.  **And currently, they do this with impunity!**  I promise to do everything in my power to put an end to these horrors/minor inconveniences.

Effective immediately, all pickles will be purged from this subreddit.  And asked how an inanimate object with no discernible limbs is capable of playing the ukulele."	t5_2qltz	True

1298915122.0	fufaq	Best way to learn how to play?	Ikarus3426	15	0	12	"A couple of years ago I got a ukulele for my birthday. Nothing great, just a lower end one with a decent sound that I could play to see if I liked it. I have a lot of musical background playing woodwinds (alto sax, specifically). But I've never played any string instruments. My alto sax has since broken and been to expensive to repair, so I'm hoping the uke can feed my musical side. 

But, I'm as beginner as you can get. Since I've had it, I've played a little bit, tried to learn some basic skills, but I haven't devoted the time to really learn it. Well I want to give it that time now. What's the best way to learn? I was hoping for some lesson books or something that breaks things down pretty well, any recommendations? Any tips would be appreciated.

Also: How the hell do you people sing and strum at the same time? 

tl;dr - No string instrument background, want to learn how to play the uke. Tips? Recommendations for good lesson books/teaching materials?"	t5_2qltz	True

Just wondering how hard it is to pick up, and any tips (including good tutorial websites) where I could learn the basics.  I've never played an instrument before, and my only experience with string instruments is guitar hero (which pretty much means none.)  Since I'm in grad school at most I could play a couple hours every couple of days, so I realize I won't get good really fast.  Thanks!  
  
EDIT: Thanks everyone, I bought a Uke today and started trying out all these sites, but one thing I have been having a lot of problems getting down is just how to strum.  When I watch videos people seem to just wave their hand over the uke and make awesome noise, and I get this weird hodge podge and my fingers just seem to get stuck.  Is there a particular way to strum?  note: I have had it tuned."	t5_2qltz	True

2.    Voting ends the 28th of June. The winner will be the top comment at the time voting ends.

3.    You can use any instruments in addition to the ukulele. You don't even have to use an ukulele- I'd allow something sufficiently uke-like such as a charango or a cuatro venezolano. Just remember that your uke (or uke substitute) must feature prominently in the song. I'll leave it up to the voters to decide how big a role it has to play.

4.   It would be impossible to actually enforce rules about voting, but please don't downvote legitimate submissions. Different people are at different skill levels.
