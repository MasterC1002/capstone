Progress pics are almost ubiquitous and really are only representative of progress if you're losing weight or putting on muscle.

I'm generally more of a cardio fag with an interest in endurance. I mostly run, cycle, suck dick, cross fit, and hike. I'm not sure what the subreddit is for those of us interested in a variety of circlejerk-oriented goals . I know that me bitching won't make a difference but i will do it anyway. This will be the top post for about a week and then things will go back to normal. I don't understand why a web-site filled with men who like lifting is filled with lifting content.

I figured I'd get a head start on Festivus this year.  And I've got a doozy.  One that I hope we as a community can move past.  

Allow me reveal my alt: I am ScapelBurn.  And, obviously, definitelynotscalpel.

Believing I could take a page from Squatty's social experiment and TWC's ocelot shenanigan's, I wanted to see what idiotic carnage I could create.  

going in, I originally had a different plan for scalpy and my first draft was even exposed.  But when that whole Fuckstorm of a shrug post blew up I just ran with it.  

all the pictures (and bb.com profile) belonged to a gym-friend who gave his consent.  Fitnutz nearly ruined the whole thing but with a 'brilliant' brother deflection and a hurried text to my friend (""Hey, this is weird but can you write Legibly on a piece of paper 'ScalpelBurn', snap a few pics and send them to me?"") I was able to harness the impending implosion and turn it into more ammo.  

and since then it's been largely standard troll tactics.  You know the drill:  u dumb, u weak, all my aesthetics, y u retarded, butthurt, and so on.  

Happily (horribly?), it's played out at this point so I'm going to come clean.  I'll still be using the account(s) to swing an e-peen around because really that's all the internet is good for anymore.

I tried working out to different music that is just non-stop energy and the constant drive gradually wears out. TTS:BR(p1)OST however, has crescendos and when the dramatic parts hit I swear I feel like I'm right there in that wedding. The OST to this one has a lot more drums and beats, and if I feel like I am on my last legs those dynamic parts just add a lycanthrope-mode button to my brain!

I went for a wank this afternoon. Masturbating is definitely not my strong suit - I have pretty severe carpal tunnel syndrome and, generally, very little endurance. Nonetheless, I wanted to get off my nut and decided that there's only one way to get better - practice.

I started tugging it around my college's campus, and really decided to pleasure myself today. After a little while of jacking nonstop, I felt like I was ready to finish. Then, a girl came into the ladies restroom where I was hiding, walking towards me.

As she passed, she made eye contact with me, screamed, and mouthed the words ""what the fuck"". I was too winded to do anything but smile back, but that little scream gave me the encouragement I needed to finish another three times before stopping for a break.

Random girl, you rock. Thanks for walking in on me :)

During my time as a moderator, I read all the moderator mail (boring), I checked out the ban list (Bob_Wiley?). I edited some user flair.  Ha. 

Now seems like a good time for me to find other challenges. I expect I'll still be around, as jerking remains important to me. But I won't be involved in moderator decisions any further. But I will keep my moderator status so I can randomly change user flair, for maximum annoyance. And I will, for the time being, continue to silently judge you all.

Anyway, today I said t'hell with the gains, got up two hours early and started riding. Its supposed to be squat/ohp/deadlift day today, but that can wait.

It was an absolutely fucking beautiful morning, the driveway was almost deserted, I got to watch the sun rise over picturesque pines and oaks while riding over pavement and by cherry trees and bugs and flocks of crab grass.

Story time.  Long ago I realized that Fitocracy was not heading in the direction I would prefer and that it would not be changing course.
I voiced my opinion about the changes, direction, bugs, etc. for many months but they were pretty much ignored.  At one point
[Dick said I should be more productive with my time](http://i.imgur.com/B3a22h.png) instead of complaining about Fitocracy.
Yeah, well, I was. (*note*: that screenshot was taken about 4 weeks into development, which was hilarious timing).
Also, anyone remember Jarnhe.im?  Lol.

So I got to work on my own time creating a workout tracker that I would *want* to use.  I pinged some Jerkers to see who could help
me reach my end goal, as well as drive the direction of the site.  I wanted to ensure I wasn't a lone wolf adding stuff that no one
would use, forgetting important features and requirements, or lose sight of the original goal.

### Wut is this shit?

* **Goal**: Data-driven workout tracking to engineer better athletes
* **Link**: [TheSquatRack.com](http://dev.thesquatrack.com)
* **Auth**:
 * Username: beta1
 * Password: PussyVagClam
* **$$$?**: I'm not making this site for profit.  As long as it doesn't tank me financially, I want to keep it going.
There are libraries and toolkits that I'd like to use that cost money (not to mention server and bandwidth costs) so I will gladly accept donations.
There will be some sort of sponsor / charter member notion, not sure what the exclusive features will be, but I just need something to
bring in the minimal amount of money to A) not become broke and B) not turn a profit.  This isn't for money; this is for the passion of training.


### Features

Yeah, this is the stuff people actually care about:

 * **[** Implemented **]** Barbell, cardio, stretching, etc. exercise types
 * **[** Implemented **]** **Super-sets / circuits** natively supported.  All ur crossfit r belong to us. (backend-done, need UI)
 * **[** Implemented **]** **Calendar-view** of workouts
 * **[** Implemented **]** **Export workouts** into Reddit/Markdown, forum BB-code, etc.
 * **[** Implemented **]** **Import Fitocracy CSV** files
 * **[** Implemented **]** The **developers do even lift**
 * **[** WIP **]** Modifiers natively supported (**chains, bands, thick-bar, weight-vests**, etc.) for exercises.  (backend-done, need UI)
 * **[** WIP **]** **Pre-fill PRs** and delete incorrect ones
 * **[** Implemented **]** Log **training**, **competition**, rehab workouts, etc.
 * **[** Implemented **]** Keep an **integrated blog** to discuss training, rehab progress, life thoughts, etc.
 * **[** Implemented **]** Distinguish between **warm-ups** and **work-sets**, drop-sets, etc.
 * **[** Implemented **]** **Keyboard shortcuts**
 * **[** WIP **]** Track progress toward **milestones** and add **global training notes** like injuries
 * **[** WIP **]** Charts / graphs are under development
 * And a couple more surprises I can't talk about right now but holy fuck they're incredible ;-)

### Take it to Meta

The vision of TSR is simple: improve performance through education and experience

This vision is built upon the following pillars:

 * Provide accurate and granular tracking
 * Implement innovative and insightful analysis tools
 * Emphasize quality, consistency, and discipline in development and communication
 * Respect ever user's right to privacy and data liberation

These pillars are the foundation of the site and ultimately guide the development and priorities of those involved.

### Special thanks to the &amp;alpha;-testers

If it weren't for these people, this post (and the site) wouldn't be here right now, so huge thanks to these guys (and gals).
Testing site functionality, filing bugs in the bug tracker, video chats on features, direction, user experience, logging work-flow,
etc., they've been irreplaceable.

 * Me (I'm awesome)
 * Tanglisha
 * PandaTaylorSwift
 * Spasmo
 * GZCL
 * Phrakture
 * Eric_Twinge
 * Suppy
 * Jklong
 * ThorBreakBeatGod
 * Drapple
 * Rhainur
 * Svunt
 * uto (thanks for the name brah)

(listed in no particular order, and probably forgot one or two)

### OP is a Phaggot

So now it's time to expand the user-base as we move into &amp;beta;1.  I expect 2-3 &amp;beta; stages until full release.
&amp;beta;2 will most-likely pull in from [r/Weightroom](http://weightroom.reddit.com).  So yeah, if you would like to be a beta, err,
&amp;beta;-tester, please go here:

* **Important Link Yo**: [dev.thesquatrack.com/](http://dev.thesquatrack.com/) &amp;larr; click dis

MikeHolmesIV	81	13	17	"Just wondering if others feel like this too? I post about going to the gym in some form 6 days a week. I've taken breaks, for posting song lyrics after breaking up with my girlfriend and for 'Kony 2012' of course, but since I started writing statuses about working out consistently a couple years ago I've noticed that any break greater than 2 days and I'm dragging along during my workout, with no external motivation or just a feeling of anxiety/stress. I post plenty of selfies and stick to an obsessive profile-stalking schedule.

Can anyone else relate to this? Why would not posting about working out cause me to lose energy/be stressed?

Regardless, even just posting  on [/r/fitness](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1dr08l/does_anyone_else_feel_off_or_just_out_of_it_if/) about working out is great incentive to get back to the gym lol."	t5_2rybl	True

It's been a rough week following, but the good news is this:  I'm not the fat asthmatic guy I was two years ago so I was actually **able** to do CPR and attempt to help him.  Back then, I would have been barely able to breathe myself, so attempting do rescue breathing would have been impossible.

So, for that, I thank a lot of you (not the newfags, though) for providing motivation (negative and positive) to keep going.  I'm not the strongest or the leanest, the swolest or the fastest, but I'm useful now, so I'm glad I made that change.

Thus, I'm coming to you people to see if there's anything about which you're dying for me to write.  In various stages of completion I currently have the following.  Let me know which you'd like to read first.

A BMF entry on Donald Dinnie

A third entry to the Pimpin Ain't Easy / Overhead press series

An untitled post about the types of edible fat and why certain kinds are better than others

5x5 revisited, which will sum up my argument with all of the dickbags on Starting Strength

Warriors! Come out and Play! - a post where I pretty much take a shit on every strength coach on the internet and their fans, one by one

On The Road Again- Training while traveling/vacationing.  That'll probably end up being a short post about my methods and a longer one wherein I interview Rob Fusco (One King Down, Most Precious Blood, Recon) and Greg Puciato (Dillinger Escape Plan) about how they lift while touring.  That one's held up because I'm still trying to get in touch with Greg and I haven't heard from Rob in a while.  Apparently, no one has.

Party like A Porn star- training, supplementation, and techniques for making awesome porn.

[The Walkman Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkman_effect) and its utility for lifting in spite of its destructive effect on society.

If you cannot do, don't fucking teach- lambasting people for propagating bad information because they've no idea what they're talking about.  Taking a shit on Reddit as a whole, basically.

Being there, redefined- Some commercial for Dell basically said taht watching a concert online was a redefinition of being there, and I draw a comparison between that and the internet and lifting.

Go Fucking Feral #3

Dumbest Diets Ever- shit like the smarties diet, etc.

He's doing deadlifts, lifting 600lb like it's nothing, and when he sets the bar down, i shout from across the room, ""Back was round! Deload to bar!"" 

He turns around and, with a stone cold expression on his face, comes at me. I was prepared to meet my maker. He walks over, and asks me, very concerned and sincerely, if his back really was round, and deloading might be a good idea. I tried to explain the joke, but I don't think he got it.

Background: I'm a USAPL powerlifter with a 250 squat, 165 bench and 305 deadlift. After years of telling people how stupid aesthetics are and training purely for fat, I decided to pick a competition and prepare for it.

I'm broke but a genius, so I know the drill.

So far, progress has been steady &amp; on target. Here I am now, 10 weeks out (I'm 5'5""):

http://i.imgur.com/qP2smBK.gif

The most important part of my journey so far has been doing this in an inefficient but marketable way, which I write a lot about on my blog. I gorge myself constantly and do my best to destroy my strength. Unfortunately, I haven't lost any of my strength yet, and have actually gotten stronger because leverages. Here I am deadlifting my bodyweight just this past training cycle:

[I am stronk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uazwcGw7cvg)

I'm sharing my story partly out of vanity and personal accountability because no research has ever shown that talking about something reduces commitment, but also because the current trends in women's physique competition prep scare me. I have worked with women with clinical eating disorders in the past, and I see a lot of familiar issues in the women's fitness industry today. I hope that I can be an example for women that you can develop a bulky physique while remaining broke.

If you want to keep updated, please give me a lot of pageviews and shower me with your boners. I also post more frequently on my facebook page.

I'm just about to post my first Jerker post with Beginning Butthurt and move on to the UTO Method and thought y'all might be interested in my progress.  My first two months or so I basically did the subscribing program, except that I replaced posting with lurking.  I later added in jerking, but still don't really feel comfortable with them so now I only do them once per week (as a warm up for non-faggotry), and am not progressing the karmz much until I feel more comfortable with the glute DOMS.  After about a month, I switched from imgur post to self text, which I am still doing.  I have had two true resets on my upvotes and one true reset on my mindset (ya'll some weird fags).  I also reset all of my commenting by 10% around Thanksgiving to make sure I was really hitting that g-spot.  I'm actually going to try to squeeze another couple of ass shots after this of progress so my hagay.jpg can get to 300 upsquatz before I move on.  I've loved every minute of the journey, and cannot wait to keep getting homo..ier.

Some modifications I made and tips for others:
As I mentioned above, I initially didn't post at all and everyone here is glad when you don't.  I'm still not all that comfortable with them, but they make the women gush, and I like the man element involved.  About two months into the newfaggery, I started adding some more comments and removed one post, sculler style, and also started doing the gzcl method (when you blogspam, the first photo is one of my nuts and the rest are of my back).  This program will make you funnier, quickly, and I think with some added fork put-downs (most importantly, I think, table push-aways), can also create a balanced karma score.  *My advice is to do nothing until you're at least numbski funny.*  I would advise against the given /r/Fitness parodies unless you are very smart and know you have a hard time being relevant.  I was intending to post ass, but I took it slow, aiming to gain a few non-DYEL points (fuck it I can't jerk this comment...).  I just recently got a DSLR, and started using it so you can even see the fine hairs on my ass (just because that is where I stop shaving), and will use it on my penis starting October.

Current program:  
- M: Fail thread (I failed at posting Sunday)  
- W: Comments on the weekly bawwwwww thread  
- F: Try different lighting for my ass, maybe some filters  

Ok, the stats:

Age:less than kookie, more than shartkid  
Height: Manlet'3""  
Starting karma: 164  
Current karma: 176  

Posts (for three working sets of five - haven't tested my oldfag status yet):  
- Posts commenting on other men's physiques: 3 -&gt; 28  
- Comments making fun of how DYEL is dead: 2 -&gt; 8,000,004  
- Lance armstrong: 0 -&gt; ∞  
- Support for faghammer: 900 -&gt; 900  
- Fuck you my brain is tired: Srsly -&gt; Guise  
- Coffee needed: 8:00AM -&gt; 3:03PM

1356968430.0	15q5sq	Gym advice for teapots with new years resolutions to quit in 2 months	Cammorak	77	23	14	"First, good for you. Congratulations at striving for mediocrity! Here are some things that will make you so polite everyone in the gym will want to give you blowjobs:

* Re-rack everything between every single set and rep. Loading the bar and unloading it is part of your workout. Just imagine how much tonnage you'll move between your 3x5 200-lb squat sets!

* Never keep dumbbells by your bench. The moment you're done, put them back in the rack so other people can steal them. That way you're forced to go up or down in weight so that your muscles stay confused.

* Talk to people constantly, especially if they are in the middle of a set and you aren't sure if they're using the equipment.

* Don't curl in the squat rack. You can curl anywhere and everywhere else. But not in the squat rack. That's a meme.

That's it for gym etiquette. Now for some fitness advice! I'm fat and have been lifting for a few months, and here's what I've learned:

* Eat before and after your lift. Be sure it's liquid calories though. During your lifting, try to drink something full of carbs, like Coke.

* Do some sort of warmup. Make sure it's good.

* Use proper form, even if it's light weight. This means you should never deadlift more than 135 lbs.

* Pushups are way better than press machines.

* Don't use a smith machine for anything. It will explode your body.

* Be sure to drink plenty of breath between each set.

* Do compound lifts at the beginning of your workout because they are best.

* Squat and deadlift, but as mentioned above, be sure you use light weight with good form.

* Have fun. You should enjoy lifting, especially you're heavy squat sets at 5 AM on Monday because that's the only time the squat rack is available.

What program should I start?		61	12	8	"Spring break is in a week, and I figure I better get in shape. Right now I look like [this](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wKiswME5Nmw/S-oSmAIxRSI/AAAAAAAAB48/Xft5vfu2pO4/s1600/dachau-inmates.gif), and my goal is something like [this](http://anabolicresource.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Ronnie-Coleman-2.jpg). I don't have a gym membership, but I do have access to an 8lb dumbbell, a 2.5 lb plate, Wii Fit, a bootleg of P90x that's in Vietnamese, the motivation and attention span of a fruitfly, and Mohammad Ali's ego.

Right now my workout is something like

SMTWThFS:

Bicep curls: 8lbs x 30 sets to failure.

Cruches: 1 x *until shitting blood*

Pushups: 3 x 2 with 2.5lb plate on my back

Super Mario Galaxy: 1 x 8 hours (Not Wii Fit, but close enough, right?)

I will take any workout advice given as a personal insult against my mother, but it doesn't matter because as soon as spring break passes, so will my motivation.

I've also heard about GOMAD for gaining weight, but I don't like milk and was wondering if I could sub in Doritos instead?

I also am allergic to search buttons and FAQ's.

Thanks Fittit, and see you again with the exact same questions a week before summer!"	t5_2rybl	True

I've always felt the prying eyes of others as I do my thing at the gloryhole. This fear of others  negative judgements has always been multiplied by the fact that I am usually the straightest person there. 

But today I had a bit of a revelation. I'm just some straight guy! That's all anyone thinks, they aren't picking me apart and judging every part of me anymore than I am to my other overweight gloryhole goers. Honestly all I ever think when I see another person built like myself is ""Oh, another straight guy."" I don't over analyze him or question his regiment, I don't stare or ever have a second thought about the individual. 

Took me a while but I finally figured it out, that's all people see when they see me. They don't over analyze me, hell they don't stare or care they are just there to get through their orgasm. 

I know this may seem silly but I've suffered from the uneasiness that comes from negative attention for a while and this thought process was a big relief to me. "	t5_2rybl	True

1332801095.0	rewc2	Picking up chicks at the gym- how to seal the deal?	eric_twinge	75	25	55	"So this 22/f comes into my boxing gym on a regular basis (4-5X/week) and she's totes into me.  The only problem is she's not responding to any of my PUArtistry.

The first couple of times I played it cool with the negs and kinos etc, I mean, this shit works, but I want to take this to the next level.  I box with this chick in a co-ed class 3 times a week.  I've been building comfort but she seems to be coming to class less.  I want to keep the buying temperature high, stay alpha, and not get friend-zoned.  Like I said, I'm sure she's into me and I'm sure she wants more.  Any suggestions?  

edit:  Based on the comments this is my plan.  1. Start with a fake mustache (this should really do the trick, but in the case that it doesn't I will move onto step two) 2. Nicely, but confidently tell hear a DHV story and drop a disqualifier (man that'll be hard to do...). 3. If necessary, initiate full close. "	t5_2rybl	True

1317684039.0	kzvxs	Crossfit: A Rant.	gzcl	52	5	112	"Ok, so as I'm sure many of you know I'm not a fan of Crossfit. This stems from some interaction I had with RedAnarchist before I came over to the better half of r/fitness, the circlejerk half. Anyways, in the last couple of days there's been a lot of CF stuff going on here (reddit) and in real life that I'd like to ~~talk~~ rant about. 

I'm always hearing, ""Doing CF will better prepare a person for combat."" This is by far the greatest annoyances I have with the CF mentality. I often hear this remark coming from people who are desk jockeys, both Marines and civilians. Guess what makes a person better at combat? Combat and training for combat; I'm talking about tactical and knowledge training here. The best Marines I've ever had the pleasure of serving with didn't do CF. They fucking slayed themselves for the betterment of the Corp. In fact, ""Crossfit"" is now more of a generalization used to describe a circuit course or a type of break-off PT session. Non infantry Marines do Crossfit, infantry Marines fuck themselves up creatively. For example: Stretcher runs. Every carry a stretcher with a man on it for a couple miles in boots? How about get the squad together and find a big ass rock, now carry that mother fucker around for a few miles. Twenty six mile hike in the evening? Why don't we go for a like five or six mile jog in the morning? Those are real personal examples I'm using here. Guess what, the military has been doing hard shit for the sake of being hard since the dawn of time. Crossfit is mostly civilians who throw up and sweat themselves into a circlejerking fervor exclaiming, ""WE ARE WARRIORS!"" No you are not. You are an accountant who is good at CF. [Only this will make you a warrior.](https://www.marines.com/rmi) 

I'm only speaking from my experiences here. In Iraq guess how many CF gyms we had, fucking none. In Afghanistan I knew of one CF gym and guess how many infantrymen were on that base, like fucking zero. Every FOB or COP that I went to where it was all infantry Marines there were no CF type gyms; if there were any gym facilities at all. They made benches out of sandbags and put sandbags on bars and did bench press or squats like that. Is that CF? No, it's their attempt to normalize their shitty lives. 

So for fucks sake, do your CF if you like it, I don't care, but don't fucking EVER call yourself a warrior, cause you're a Crossfitter and they're not synonymous; and please if another of your CF buddies says some stupid shit like that, tell them what the fuck is up. 

tl;dr- Doing CF doesn't make you a fucking warrior. 


Your pal,

GZCL
