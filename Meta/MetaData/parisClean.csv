  While researching Paris like crazy, I've accumulated a lot of links from this subreddit. Saw that the wiki is kind of bare so maybe this post could also be linked to further help tourists?

By browsing through the subreddit, I was able to research the neighborhood I wanted to stay in, find an apartment, find information about the metro, restaurants, Disneyland, rock climbing, etc.  Everything I needed to know and more!  I live in Miami, a city that also gets a lot of tourism, and our subreddit tends to have people asking the same questions over and over, so I know it can get annoying.  I just wanted you to know it is also helpful for those of us doing research, and aided in making my week in Paris pretty freaking awesome. Not to mention, your city is beautiful, the food was delicious, and the people were generous and kind, despite the fact that every time I tried to speak French I had a small panic attack and forgot how to say anything.

**Clarification:** I didn't mean to make it sound like I was expecting Dali moustaches and berets on everyone. I make it a habit to find out for myself instead of believing the stereotypes that were handed down by media and word of mouth.
 
Rude Parisians: Nope. Busy/not able to assist a hapless tourist - sure. Now show me a major city ANYWHERE that doesn't have that. 99% were willing to make an effort. (I was seriously internet enabled so I had an advantage to the point I was able to help a guy from Belgium navigate the metro so...)

Smell/Dirty: Not from what I saw. Street cleaners were a regular fixture in the 10th district and were very visible in other areas as well. Maybe it gets more fragrant in summer but I challenge any big city to do better.

Don't speak perfect French - you're boned: The closest I got to this was when someone asked me for directions and I had to let them know that I didn't speak enough of the language to help them and that got me a bit of a ""fuck you"" shrug. After that it turned into almost a playful game with a few waiters of I'm not speaking English, let's see if we can get by without it - and that was worth the grins and chuckles as we worked out the fact that I did in fact mean to order Pastis and duck gizzards.

After two weeks I've learned to ""pardon"" my way on and off the Metro like a Parisian and I'm 24h back home and already missing your fair city. Make a minor effort to use the language and most people will meet you halfway. 

End note: Paris does not deserve the BS stereotypes that have been hung on it and it's one of the best experiences I've had on vacation."	t5_2qkoi	True

Trying to compile all inputs, I come up with this modest proposal : **a picnic in [Parc Montsouris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parc_Montsouris).**

* Date &amp; time : saturday june 25th 2011 at 12:00 (yep, that's *noon*)
* Rendezvous point : the oval patch of grass that stretches just at the entrance next to the tramway and RER stations ""Cité Universitaire"", boulevard Jourdan. See [Google map](http://maps.google.fr/maps?hl=fr&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=parc+montsouris&amp;cp=7&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;biw=1676&amp;bih=923&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wl) and [this](http://i.imgur.com/nprFj.jpg)

* For those who use a GPS, coordinates are  48°49'16.77""N 2°20'13.83""E


From there, we will proceed further inside the park.

Of course, this is a Bring Your Own event, so bring your own everything : food and drinks^[1] of course, maybe a mat or something to sit on, and if you may, ball, freesbee, games and such. Fancy name tag suggested.


I may *not* be able to bring a rallying sign, so if someone feels like coming with a big sign or a giant stuffed alien, all the better.

Any of you with shaman skills please do this dance for fair weather ;-)

In the unlikely event of adverse weather, *plan B* is a café, namely [""Le Tabac du Parc Monsouris""](http://maps.google.fr/maps?hl=fr&amp;q=parc+montsouris&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;st=107658235038825379151&amp;rq=1&amp;ev=p&amp;split=1&amp;t=h&amp;sll=48.824028,2.335933&amp;sspn=0.000703,0.002248&amp;radius=0.06&amp;hq=parc+montsouris&amp;hnear=&amp;ll=48.824126,2.336048&amp;spn=0.000703,0.002248&amp;z=20&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=48.824126,2.336048&amp;panoid=2345KLQcE78_RIFGaKOdVA&amp;cbp=12,224.12,,0,1.77), accross the park from the rendezvous point, at the crossroad of Avenue Reille / Avenue René Coty / Rue Nansouty


If you'd like to know my mobile phone number, just drop me a private message.


***See you there :-)***

I've been hearing some rumors about parisian redditors wanting to meetup this weekend... Well then, what are we waiting for?! LET'S MEETUP!

I suggest we go back to a nice little bar some of you might've already been to on a previous meetup called Bob Cool. Located in the Odéon neighbourhood, this bar makes killer cocktails. Plus: they have happy hour on Saturdays between 7 and 9 PM! 5 euro cocktails, anyone?

Here are all the deets:

* **When?** Saturday October 6th at 7 PM /19h.
* **Where?** Bob Cool, 15 rue des Grands Augustins, Paris 6e. Metro Odéon (lines 4 &amp; 10) or Saint-Michel (line 4 + RER C &amp; B).
* **Emergency phone number:** [edited]

Hope to see you all there!

Margaux aka Marginsky

PS: If your name is Bruno or Thomas then you should definitely come and drink with us because October 6th is your name day.

**EDIT:** (merci Nath) It is indeed Nuit Blanche on Saturday, too! If some of you want to go, no problem, feel free to go afterwards eventually, or we could move there all together."	t5_2qkoi	True

1314832237.0	k0pgp	Beware of deaf/mute scam	aramadia	29	1	33	"Just got back from Paris and I wanted to let future visitors know to be extra cautious of this scam.  A person will be carrying a clipboard motioning you to sign something like a petition.  It will be about a deaf/mute international organization and it is conveniently written in English.  There are several signatures that are all fake, and as you are signing you get to the donation line.  You decide to not be an ass and write down 1 Euro.  You get out your wallet, (if you haven't already been pickpocketed yet during this time), and get out some change.  Then the guy will motion aggressively (staying true to form) and write down the minimal donation is 5 or 10 Euros.  Now you feel really bad and proceed to dole the money or walk away if finally your suspicious activity threshold has been breeched.

What pisses me off is clearly they are being organized and taking money from people who are truly handicapped and in need.  I see several of these people camped around tourist locations carrying the same god damn form.  They can be quite intense, so your best bet is to completely ignore them.

As an American, I'm used to dogs being wild, wacky and highly sociable. In cities, you must keep your dog on a leash. It's not really a matter of ""just in case your dog takes off"" it's more a matter of ""BECAUSE your dog will take off"". Most dogs in public will get excited when a stranger pays any attention to them, licking, panting, sometimes jumping up and down if it isn't trained (or, on the contrary, they will bark).  It's as if American dogs are just highly emotional creatures.  

But here in Paris, I never see anyone using a leash.  Dogs happily trot alongside their owners without a care in the world.  They are very rarely distracted by anything.  When I pass a café with a dog sitting outside, I will cluck at it with my tongue and maybe pat it on the head (with permission) but I never get a reaction.  It's like nothing gets through to these dogs, they're just beyond jaded.  They'll even wait at the front of a store without a leash while their owner shops.  IT BLOWS MY MIND.

So what is with this?  Are city pet owners required to take their dogs to training school?  What is it that Parisians are doing differently with their dogs that make them so... subservient?

**Edit:** Okay, things are getting weird here in Paris. I just returned from the store where a little old lady allowed someone to go in front of her while waiting at the cash register. The Apocalypse is nigh. "	t5_2qkoi	True

Whether you're a born and raised Parisian, an international student or a tourist visiting the city: let's meetup and share a few drinks!

We could meet around 7 PM / 19h. Depending on the number of people coming, we'll choose an appropriate place. A bar in the Rue Mouffetard might be nice, for example. (If you have ideas for the place of the meetup, fire away.)

Anyway, I hope you can make it and am looking forward to meeting you!

**EDIT:** I suggest we do as Neker suggested and meetup at Le Requin Chagrin. Sounds like a great bar to start with.

So, here's everything you need to know:

* **When?** Saturday 17 September, at 7 PM / 19h.
* **Where?** Le Requin Chagrin, Place Contrescarpe, 5th arondissement. Métro Place Monge (ligne 7) or Cardinal Lemoine (ligne 10).
* **How to find us?** Look out for the Reddit Alien poster.
* **If you're running late** or just coming later in the evening, you can contact redditor friarobaz to know in which bar we are so you can join us (look for his number in the comments).

"" *We joked around, reminiscing about old Gary and the nutty songs he used to write and about the time Michael and I were at Disneyland Paris, taking the Peter Pan ride, when we paused in front of the animatronic Wendy.*

*“She’s so beautiful,” Michael had sighed, and then we looked at each other and we instantly knew what we had to do. I’m not proud of it, and it was wrong, but it had to be done. To show our admiration, we lifted up Wendy’s skirt and left our signatures on her, shall we say, animatronic person. And I am sure that, to this day, on the Peter Pan ride in Disneyland Paris, if anyone should ever be so bold as to life poor animatronic Wendy’s skirt, they would find my signature and Michael’s signature, staking our claim. Actually, I lied when I said I wasn’t proud of this moment. Actually I am.* ""

This was 2 years and 10 months ago and one of the remaining relics of our honeymoon was a special blend of tea from Angelina's Tea Room right on the Jardin des Tuileries.  Due to a recent series of unfortunate events, this tea that we were too afraid to drink because it was so special... was destroyed.  When we found out, my wife burst into sobs and I felt the pit of my stomach turn into knots.  I would love to purchase this tea again for our 3rd year anniversary, but cannot find any source online.  If anyone out there in Paris is willing to go to Angelina's Tea Room to purchase me a few boxes and send them to America, I would gladly repay you with enough funds to cover the gift and an excellent lunch at Angelina's.  Their foie salad still finds its way into my dreams, and the hot chocolate is world famous.  Or maybe you would enjoy an exchange for some American products?  I am willing to do whatever it takes to get this tea for my wife.  It goes without saying that you would have my utmost gratitude.

EDIT:  Thank you for the responses /r/paris!!! I just awoke about an hour ago, 7am Central, which means it is 2pm in Paris.  Working on responses now!

LastNightInParis	24	4	18	"I'm a 22 M from Colorado who decided to live in Paris for a few months for an internship (Architecture).  I live in the 14th near Mouton Duvernet.  I think that i've seen most of la rive gauche, but i'm not sure about la rive droite.  Suggestions for either would be great!  Also, everybody I know is currently on vacation so I have no plans for tomorrow (Monday) night.  I have to leave fairly early on Tuesday, but if anybody would like to have a few drinks on the river on Monday night let me know.  I've always been a lurker (ha obvious by my account name), but i'll check online tomorrow afternoon.
  
I'll start.  

1.  Google Map search ""rue piat"" and it should put you right at Parc de Belleville.  At that exact location is one of the best views of the city as well as a fantastic cafe.  I highly recommend for drinks around sunset.  

2.   Google map search ""le canal paris"".  It is the same Canal as Parc de Villette (which is also really fun).  This neighborhood is filled with young people and there are always groups relaxing along the canal at night.  I had never been until two weeks ago.  Really fun.

3.  The last is, IMO, one of the best buildings in Paris.  It is a library called Bibliotheque St. Genevieve.  I know that most people don't want to spend the summer in a library, but it is worth going just for the building.

1310332221.0	ilu91	Things I've Learnt About Paris and Parisians After a Week	tuple	26	5	46	"Some casual observations so far after a week:

* I've found the Metro to be better than the tube (london) and subway (new york) in terms of frequency and reliabilty during operating hours. Although has lots of stairs.

* Fare evasion is a national past time. Parisians will go out of their way to help fellow parsians get through the turnstiles without a ticket. Station staff turn a blind eye.

* Parisians like smoking, a lot. On a saturday night, there was a queue at the tabbacco shop of 25 people.

* There are no convenience stores like 7/11 anywhere.

* A lot of streets are named after famous people and events. Leclerc, mitterand, pompidou, de gaulle (you get the picture).

* Not many people i've encountered speak english well even in the touristy areas.

* I feel sorry for the parisian women who wear high heel shoes day in day out. But everyone's dress sense is incredible. You can easily spot the tourist in paris unlike in lots of other cities I've visited.

* I don't know how parisians negotiate the champs elysee roundabout. (12 streets merging). Watching it looked like organized chaos.

* Cyclists own the city an are respected. They even have their own miniature traffic lights.

* The bouncers in paris are douchebags just like any other city.

* I've found most parisians to be nice. Saying thank you and goodbye to shop owners is a must. Speaking in broken french is better that asking ""parlez vous anglais"". They respect that you are making an effort.

* Never pay more than 1 euro for the bottled water they sell on the street. I once asked how much it was and the guy said 2 euros. I walked away because I only had 1 euro on me and he stopped me and said I could have it for 1.

* Keep to the right on all escalators if you don't want to be poleaxed

If you like art, you'll probably want to go to the Louvre. Go in the underground entrance (through the metro), and I'm not sure but I think you'll get free entry with a student Visa and student ID. Otherwise it's like 10 euro. However, I've heard musee D'Orsay across the river is actually better.

Don't go up the Eiffel Tower. It's honestly not worth it. You'll wait like 6 hours. If you pick a weekday, I would still say just walk up to the second level. If you want the best view in Paris, go to the observation deck of the Montparnasse Tower

Some people say that's because it's the only place in Paris where you can't see the Montparnasse Tower..

Versailles is worth a whole day. The gardens are massive and you can even row in the lake. Make sure you get on the RER early enough. I'd also check out the sacre cœur.

People love the catacombs, but if you don't get there early, like a half hour before it opens (at 10 I think), you'll be in line a long while. If you can get there on time it's worth it for sure.

If you like military museums, I can't speak for sure because I haven't been to Germany, but Les Invalides might be the best in Europe. Napoleon is also buried there.

One of the best things to do in Paris is picnic and lounge in public. Parisians do this in every park, public seating area and along the river. They go well into the night, with wine, games and more. Join them. (My favorite was along the Champ des Mars under the Eiffel Tower)

Great clubs are Batofar, on the Seine in eastern Paris, and Showcase under the pont alexandre III bridge. For the latter one you may want to register online or something so you don't have to pay cover.

Girls usually like the champs élysées for shopping, but if you want a more affordable and culturally authentic shopping experience, I suggest the st germain/st michel area.

All donezos. Enjoy Paris!

EDIT: corrected spelling of Batofar.

1332422910.0	r8bn8	How do Parisian Redditors feel about apple crumble muffins?	TarantusaurusRex	31	10	64	"So here is what happened: 

I made a post to AskReddit yesterday, concerning a situation in which my face was spat into while walking down Blvd. de Sébastopol near le Forum des Halles.  The man who spit directly into my face was obviously off his rocker, and I was so intimidated by him and shocked that I did nothing except continue walking, cry my eyes out, and then I went home to hide away in my room like a pansy.  

I was not clear enough concerning my intentions with that post.  I felt alone; the few friends that I do have in Paris were unavailable, and I was really just seeking some kind of comfort for a scary event.  I certainly didn't expect the thread to explode the way that it did.  I mentioned that I am an American, and that spitting is a stereotype that many Americans have of the French, and when I had my face spat into, I was suddenly aware of how a vicious stereotype could have been started.  But we all know that ass holes are found anywhere in this world, and I could easily have been in another city such as New York, Chicago, Berlin, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Beijing, etc.  The same thing happens all over.  The guy wasn't committing a French act, he was committing a vile, aggressive and asinine act regardless of his ethnicity or nationality. 

I received a lot of messages from insulted French people (as well as people of other nationalities) and I saw a lot of posts from people around the world, trying to validate my misinterpreted feelings, saying that the French are awful people.  **This simply is not true.**  Here in Paris, there are some rude people.  Same as New York.  It's a big-city mentality and it plagues big cities all over the world.  Even Parisians complain about the attitudes of other Parisians, and once you leave the limits of Paris, the kindness and hospitality can be overwhelming.  I personally live and work with a French-German family, and they are some of the most kind, hospitable and open-minded people I have ever had the pleasure to meet. 

So here's what I'm doing today:  I'm passing this sunny day in the kitchen, baking muffins.  They're apple crumble muffins, if that makes any difference.  They're also absolutely delicious and I don't mean to toot my own horn, but I can bake a mean muffin.


**EDIT:  Thursday night's muffin extravaganza was swell.  I had a lovely time and I'd like to thank all the super duper folks who stopped by to gobble up the baked goods.  I will update everyone on the Friday evening situation,  but it is currently midnight which is past my bed time so I am going to saw some logs.

Hello everybody,

I'm 22, and I'm an independant web developer. I'm looking for a collocation in Paris or in near suburbs ( from Levallois to Saint-Mandé ). I'm looking for something under 600€ with charges.

I've been living in collocations for almost 4 years, I know how it works, I'm a social person, sympathetic, and generally happy. I know how to cook, and I come with lots of stuff ( like big flat screen, bed and possibly a sofa ), I'm ( obviously ) a redditor, I like people. Long story short, I'm an easy person to live with.

I'm fluent in both french and english, so it would be a pleasure to share a flat with english-speaking people as well as french.

Thanks a lot, and may the bacon be with you.

The SO and I are going to Paris in two weeks. We've both been there already, so we've seen The Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame and Sacre Coeur. 
We don't want to do the usual touristy stuff. We're both more into nerdy stuff, but we have no idea how to find places for the likes of us in that huge city.

I have heard of an exposition about fantasy languages, but that one will leave again at march 11th, unfortunately. So far on my list are the musée de la découvertes, maison de Victor Hugo, the catacombs and the Musée Nissim de Camondo. There also seems to be a museum about cinematography somewhere, but I don't know whether it's recommended to go there or not. I've also found the Café Manga and the Bulles the Salon. And we will definately spend a lot of time at Shakespeare and Company.

So, if any of you wise people know any places like special cinemas (Audio and/or subtitles in Englisch would be nice, our French has got a bit old), cool museums, interesting bookshops or libraries, game/movies-merchandise shops, just anything we might like to see, please tell :) "	t5_2qkoi	True

So I think I'm basically looking for a place like starbucks - order at the counter then sit, closed &amp; cozy, free wifi is definitely a plus - but not actually starbucks, even though I know they have them in Paris. I'd love to try to expand my cultural horizons a bit!

It's been a long time since we've had a meetup (well, since I've been to one anyways) and this weekend there's a perfect occasion to have a nice little cultural meetup: **La Nuit des Musées!** Basically, all the Parisian Museums are open and offer activities and music etc. 

So if you're interested, take a break from Diablo III and come visit some of them with us!

This is also an excellent opportunity to have a few beers.

My best friend (and redditor) Eva is visiting Paris this week-end. She's heard all about our awesome meetups and would love to attend one. So if you're free this weekend and fancy a drink... Let's meetup!

Last month we met in the 5th arrondissement. I've heard really cool things about the Oberkampf neighbourhood, perhaps we could try out this part of the city this weekend? As always, suggestions for a bar are very welcome. (I haven't been there myself yet.)

Let's meet around 19h / 7 PM - place to be determined. I'll edit the post with further information when said information is available.

I'm looking forward to seeing you (again)!

**EDIT:** Right, time to settle on a place to meet. One of the places The_Fart_of_God suggested, Le Comptoir Général, sounds really good: it's really big and apparently pretty cool (they're featured in magazines OMG).

Here's all you need to know in a nutshell:

* **When?** Saturday 15 October, at 19h / 7 PM.
* **Where?** [Le Bar du Comptoir Général](http://www.barducomptoirgeneral.com/), 80 Quai de Jemappes, 10th arrondissement. Métro Goncourt or République (ligne 11) or Jacques Bonsergent (ligne 5). **The bar really does look like a huge place, so I suggest we meet outside, in front of the entrance.**
* **How to recognize us?** [Here](http://i.imgur.com/cESdK.jpg)'s a picture taken at a previous meetup (one month ago). Monkeyget, if you read this and decide to come: can you please bring the reddit alien poster?

Unfortunately for me it's also a time when I get almost no days off in the month because business drops off. I've been talking to some friends about ideas for nights at the bar. So far we're looking at a darts night, movie/tv night, games night etc. We decided against the quiz as every bar in Paris does them and most of them are a mess. 

So, any ideas? Your suggestions, especially from Paris based Redditors, about what you'd find interesting would be welcome.

Hi ! 

Just to let you know that I'm a new moderator of r/Paris. 

There was a [problem with the spam filter](http://www.reddit.com/r/paris/comments/fuiz8/why_do_all_my_posts_disappear_off_of_this/) and the previous mod was gone since 2 years, so I wanted to help. You can now send me a message if your post gets caught in the spam filter.

How do you want this subreddit to be modded ?

Most of the post here are in English, can I say in the sidebar that we welcome english *and* french posts ?

I don't think there's a need for strict guidelines, since we're not too much here :)

Do you want to do anything particular with this subreddit ?

Can someone make us a little **logo** ?

Does somebody else want to be mod ?

Voilà ! 

Merci !

1374878958.0	1j4m0n	Writer working on story in Paris. Need help!	HemingNoWay	21	5	13	"TL;DR:  I'm doing a crazy road trip from Paris to Marseille, stopping at every rest stop along the way, to fight for my fiancee and give my life purpose. Can you help? :) 

Hey R/Paris! 

A few months ago my life changed drastically. My fiancee had a nervous breakdown and left me to return to Argentina. I lost my job. I felt incredibly depressed. And, the worst part, I was nearly 30 years old and I realized my life wasn't close to what I dreamed it would be.. what it should have been.

Then, one desperate night, browsing the web, I came across an idea for a story –– a story that has given me a whole new purpose and some hope for the future. But, I'm writing to you guys because I might need the help of the good people in Paris to make it happen. (I'm Canadian! I basically speak French. We cool right?)

As a quick summary of the story (more info below): I'm recreating a road trip that happened 30 years ago between Julio Cortazar, one of the leading Latin American writers and a Paris expat, and his Canadian wife Carol Dunlop. In 1982 they took a 33 day road trip from Paris to Marseille --  a trip that should have only taken ten hours.

But they were writing a book and they had made up some rules... this would be no ordinary road trip! They would stop at every rest stop along the way, camping at the second one each night. The result was a series of beautiful, touching scientific observations and intimate essays on their love. The story is even more beautiful when you realize that this would be the last adventure the couple would have together. Carol was dying and she lasted only four months after the trip. Julio, heart broken, never wrote again and died about a year later.

Well... My fiancee and I had a huge connection to Cortazar, which is why I started looking at this story. One thing led to another, and I've now touched base with all their old friends and have plans to make the journey - a sort of pilgrimage - from Paris to Marseille this August.

But... I am very short on cash (hint: no job). And there are a few HUGE obstaclesa, where I am hoping the kind folks at reddit might be able to help with. If anything, I could use your advice!

1. A Car: I don't really want to rent a car since it will thousands of bucks for something decent. I'd love to pay someone in Paris $400-$500 for lending me their car? Sounds sketchy, I know, but I'll give you ID, we can meet in person, sign a contract, what ever you want! (even if you knew any cheap cars for sale, etc)

2. Spread the word! Since I'm a freelancer, I'm trying to build a lot of attention around this project. If you think it's interesting, I'd be so grateful if you helped share this on your Twitter machines, your Facebooks, and Instagrams, or what have you. Below are the links!

3. Buddies! I would love to meet up with people either in Paris or along the way, or at my final destination in Marseille. Let me know everyone! And wish me luck!

4. Cell phone plan: whats a good one that I can use for data with iPhone 4 and only temporary. Have no idea.

See you guys on the road!

I am traveling to Paris with my partner and her grandmother in mid-to-late April.  As the one person with the combination of experience in French, Paris, and the Internet, I am trying to find excellent little private tours and treats for the three of us to enjoy on grandmother's last trip to Paris.  Perhaps my fellow redditors can help?

For example, grandmere would really like to have a private tour of les Passages Couverts, but I have found very few options (via google) for a group of three to have an English language tour.  Perhaps you or someone you know works in the tourist sector and seeks to specialize in little outings like this? 

Grandmother is rather fit for a dame of her age, thanks to years of Pilates, but has a 2-3 hour window of energy for outings before it's time to rest.  She loves architecture, art and history.   And food, oh divine delicious deserts.  She'll probably be living on pastries (which she has earned after all the years of Pilates).

The two of us, on the other hand, are still young and fit and will be tearing around Paris like madwomen while grandma rests.  We'll be seeking out Paris Reddit's favorite bars and would be happy to meet up for a glass or a pint :)"	t5_2qkoi	True

Nothing enhances being on a bicycle more than autumn weather. The leaves turn beautiful colors around you, leaving you mesmerized by your commute. The cool air keeps your core temperature in perfect balance with the heat your body is producing. I can ride all day.

I am traveling to Europe for first time this Tuesday and will be visiting France, Belgium, Germany and The Netherlands. It has been my dream to tour Europe on a bicycle, for quite sometime now.

I am very grateful to be granted the opportunity to cross the pond and finally visit countries with such rich cycling culture. Unfortunately, my finances, in addition to the hasty planning of this trip has forced me to exclude the touring portion of my dream.

Nonetheless I still plan to make best of the situation with some urban cycling thanks to bicycle sharing programs. However, I have a small bicycle sharing program in my city and the bikes are quite... let's just say a bit undesirable. Not to say that I ride a $10,000 full carbon speed machine, I just ride an old lugged steel frame with minor upgrades to the crankset and wheels.

So to the point of my post, I am looking for someone who would be kind enough to help me explore the amazing fall scenery in your respective city/town. Perhaps you have an extra bike that gets little use and would like someone to tag along on your usual ride. If not I'll make do with the bike sharing program.

So if anyone is interested in making a new friend and showing this American around on a bike, I would be very appreciative.

TL;DR I am visiting Europe for first time. I love bikes, would like to meet someone with the same enthusiasm I have for fall riding. Perhaps you have a bike you can lend me."	t5_2qkoi	True

I'll keep this short and sweet. I'm an American who is technically still a student in Paris until January 2013. I have received a job offer from a relatively small (but growing fast) company in Paris. They'd like to start me out as a stagaire, since a convention du stage is incredibly easy for me to obtain and then, if all works out well, switch me to a CDI towards the end of the year.

I'm here because I'd love to know from any non-Europeans what that process is like. I know that the government isn't exactly dying to give out CDIs to Americans (or anyone non-European) so:

1. are there any tricks? 
2. How long does the process typically take to go from foreign student --&gt; CDI worker?
3. Have any of you done this successfully? 

Finally, does it make most sense to start as an intern as they suggest and then negotiate the CDI thing later (clearly much sooner than later) or try and start with the CDI, which as I understand could forfeit the remainder of my student status if I am not approved by the government.

Man, living abroad can be complicated! Any and all help would be MUCH appreciated!

I'm not trying to hijack the other post, this one is purely meant to organize the meetup on Friday, for all your other idea's or plans please use the other post.

*The plan:*

Starting out for some drinks in a bar. After that hit a music [festival](http://www.fnac.com/guides/musique/indetendances/default.asp?NID=-2) nearby (thanks baptistemarchand).

* The date: Friday 13th of August
* The time: Around 19 o'clock
* Where: The Pure Malt at 4 Rue Caron in the 4th (little scottisch bar, owned by our fellow redditor Shep66)
* How do I get there? Metro stop Saint Paul, Line 1

*Stuff for discussion*: I'll contact Shepp66 to see if he's really up for his pub being invaded by Redditors. Then could somebody figure out how late the music festival starts and when it ends? (I'm Dutch and my French sucks) Depending on that the time might change a bit, so be sure to check in one or two days, when I'll post all the final details.

Let's have an awesome night!

A little more about me: 
I'm a 26 y/o 'murican woman, working currently as a trauma-specialized therapist. I'm super into yoga, play flamenco guitar, love indie music, dancing, good wine, great books, existential philosophers, the mediterranean sea, and eating healthy, whole food.

I hope to hear from you guys soon!

1362874629.0	19zx4g	Anyone in the Paris-ish area into a balcony appropriate plant or seed swap? 	driftandwander	14	1	4	"I know this might sound weird, but I have just moved to the Paris area and FINALLY have a balcony suitable for some container gardening this spring/summer/fall. I have already started some plants from seed that are doing amazingly well, and have more seeds coming in the mail on Monday which are far in excess of what I need/have room for (I don't have room for 50 tomato plants haha). I figured it would be rad to see if there is anyone else in the area that is having the same problem, looking for some variety that they might not already have and have something to trade!


I think the easiest way to do this is to list what I have that I am willing to give up, and what I would like in exchange. If you have seeds to exchange for seeds then we can do it by post as it won't cost more than a few cents to mail en envelope, but if you are interested in a started seedling, then we will need to meet in person :)


What I have:


**SEEDS:**

* Lolla Rossa Lettuce

* Batavian ""Blond du Paris"" Lettuce

* Chicoree Scarole Lettuce

* Reine de Mai Lettuce

* 'Le Généreux' Cucumber

* Tiny Tim Tomatoes

* Cayenne Peppers

* Sweet Snap Peas


*All of these seeds are suitable for container gardening/urban balcony gardening if situated right. You can train cucumbers to grow in a bush shape if they are given something similar to a tomato cage, same goes for the sweet snap peas. No excuse not to grow your own food! :)*


**SEEDLINGS:**

* Hass Avocado (1) - Very healthy taproot, shoot is green and visible but is still a little nub haha... It is in a glass supported by toothpicks, but will be ready for planting in it's first container in about a month or two. Just in time to enjoy the summer sun. 


* Meyer Lemon (2) - Super healthy and happy plants. Both are about 2"" tall and have a sturdy pair of first leaves, second set are developing. They are currently in 1,5L water bottles that have been cut down to half size with holes poked in the bottom. They are okay in this container for another month or two before they need something a little bigger


*Both the Avocado and Meyer Lemon trees make excellent apartment plants as long as they are potted properly and have plenty of sunlight. They can also both be pruned into ""bonsai"" type trees so they will be much shorter and more round as opposed to tall. They are from organic/fairtrade fruits so will bear fruit if you are patient enough! They are very beautiful plants in the meantime. I can send pictures of either.*


I am interested in anything that is suitable for a container garden. I am particularly looking in the following, but even if it's not on the list, please ask anyway, because you never know!


* Succulent snips or seeds of any kind aside from Aloe varieties
* Lithop seeds
* Echinacea seeds (any variety/Colour)
* Any edibles - seed or very young plants suitable for containers (particularly sweet peppers, cilantro, goji berries, olive, coffee, vanilla bean, lime, kale, strawberries... let me know what you have!)
* Variety of flower good for attracting bees


I realize that a few of the plants I'm looking for aren't suitable for our zone (8), however, they are in containers so once the summer has passed I can move them to a sunny window in the winter, use growlights indoors, etc. 


Sorry that was kinda long-winded, but just looking to help out a fellow urban-gardener, try and find some plants I'm looking for and make some friends in the process :)


Have a great weekend!

It has been on my agenda since I moved to Holland from the states and I finally have some spare time (and cash) to burn. I'll be visiting for about a day or two - and would like to knock out some of the main attractions...Eiffel tower of course, the Louvre...etc.
Sadly, I'm alone on this mission unless one of you answers my calling. Not looking for a best friend here...but just a normal person who wouldn't mind my company for a while. A little about myself - a calm, collective 24/M-ENT, I've been living in Holland 9 months with no one but my 2 year old Basenji. I work long hours in IT for a web hosting/domain registrar corporation - it pays the bills...and brought me to Europe. I'm not trying to go balls-to-the-wall on this adventure - purely just for the insight and EXP.

If not - what would you all suggest is a must-see-must-go diner? One thing I like to experience anywhere I go is the food. I'll be at a solid [10] for the train ride, so believe I'll have my appetite with me.

Also, is it easy to find a hotel on the fly or is it better to book in advance. How much could I expect to spend? May be bit of a novice question - but any input is greatly appreciated. I don't need much in terms of commodities - a bed and blanket is enough for me - pillow not required.

I only recently (Jan) moved to Paris, but was curious about the law and (more importantly) attitudes towards urbex taken by the local constabulary. In the US, I've heard (never had to test this, thankfully) that having camera gear and not vandalizing a place was often enough to get off with a warning.

I've heard mixed things about urbex in Paris, leading me to believe that the police at once don't actively go after people who explore, but at the same time crack down on people that are irresponsible (vandalize, go without proper equipment and get themselves into trouble). This seems wonderful if true :)

As a foreigner with a limited (""Je suis tres desolee pour le deranger, mais je ne fais que prendre des photos"" -- and then show photos I've taken) command of French, would someone most likely be looking at a stern warning, fine, night in the jailhouse, or undocumented beating?"	t5_2qkoi	True

It has been a wonderful week, filled with epic meetups and mad drinking games. As most of you know, zgoldberg, employee of a small, unknown IT company, driving force behind the meetups (he hasn't missed a single one of them!) and sometimes host is leaving Paris to go back to the good old United States. In order to give him a proper goodbye, we thought it would be nice to share one last meal together!

~~[Le Reflet](http://www.resto-de-paris.com/le-reflet-saint-michel/restaurant/paris) is a nice little restaurant in Saint-Germain-des-Prés. The food is good and the prices are very cheap (most meals are around 6 or 8€). Depending on the number of people coming, I'll try and book us a table - but I'm not at all sure if they allow this.~~ **We're going to a different place - see the ""EDIT"" section.**

Worst case scenario: nath_n told us about a French fries place not far away (at the Panthéon), we could always try there. (By the way, nath_n ... do you know the address of the place?)

* **When?** Tuesday 27 September, 19h45.
* **Where?** The Saint Michel fountain. (RER B, RER C or métro ligne 4)
* **How to recognize us?** If you know who zgoldberg is, it means you were there at the last meetups and you'll probably recognize us. If not: he's tall with a beard.

Please RSVP in the comments so we can estimate the number of redditors we have to squeeze in the restaurant. 

A demain!

**EDIT 15h30:** We have a place to eat!! Since Le Reflet doesn't allow bookings, I called several other restaurants in Paris to find one that did. And the winner is... [Le Mini-Festin](http://www.tripadvisor.fr/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d2102994-Reviews-Mini_Festin-Paris_Ile_de_France.html), in the 16th arrondissement. I booked us a table there at 20h30. **The time and place of the meetup haven't changed, we'll just go there together.** It's about 15 minutes on the subway. (Or if you live close-by, you can join us there of course.) Meals cost between 9 and 12 euros approximately. Hope you'll like it... 

**EDIT 18h00: Invitations closed!** Limited to 12 seats - sorry, guys. It's a very small restaurant, apparently. Hope you can make it next time!

I have the feeling it's the same in the other big cities, London NY Tokyo, from what I've heard.

I forgot: The art scene is totally closed, nothing new happens except from a bunch of happy few. I'm trying the hardest to bein the happy few, but it's often frustrating.

However this is still the most impressive city I've ever seen, and just walking there is perpetual amazement, even a few years later. All foods are greatand can be dead cheap if you pay attention.

So, Parrit (if I may), how do you feel there? And if you have a similar perspective, any easier cities you'd have in mind? I'm thinking Brussels. Not that pretty but the food is nice, everything is cheaper, and oh, also the people.

I was walking in the 13th about a block north of the poterne des peupliers tram stop.  Broad daylight, about 6 people on the street.  Had one headphone in attached to my iPhone, right pants pocket.

All of a sudden I feel a weight on me, turns out this ~6' kid (black, wearing a jeans jacket and shorts, 17 or 18 years old, buzz-cut) has jumped on my back and is kicking at the back of my knees trying to get me to fall.  I was really confused at this point, thinking he was just beating my ass, so I throw him off me and he runs away.

That's when I saw my iPhone 4 in his hand, and figured out he was just trying to get at my pockets.  Me and about three other people (with more joining later) chased him as I yelled voleur at the top of my lungs, but he got away in some twisting alleys and I was told not to bother following him lest I get ""boxed"", as this is apparently a common occurence.

I'm prepared to write off the phone as a loss, and I'll go through the typical ""find my iPhone -&gt; wipe"" stages.  I was told by the locals that although I may not get my phone back, reporting the crime would help with better policing for the area, especially as I'm a US national.

Here are some burning question I have for you fine Paris redditors:

1) Is there anyone willing to try and make one or two restaurant reservations for me??? I've done a bunch of research on this subreddit and had friends recommend places and I'm worried if I don't make reservations, we won't be able to get tables, c'est comme ça?

~~3) Cheap pay-as-you-go sim card recommendations for GSM phones?~~ 

**Edit: Orange sounds best, thanks**

4) Good/Any place to watch EPL? NFL? Bowl games? 

**Edit: The Moose was on my list to check out already, definitely checking it out!**

5) Favorite place to buy wine/cheese?

**Edit: Carrefour is on the list!**

I could probably list 100 questions but I will stop there. Merci beaucoup pour votre attention! 

P.S. We're staying in the 11th arrondissement, if that helps. 


**Edit: Now with more questions!**

6) Weather will be cold and rainy, right? Should I bring an overcoat or do some layering with a fleece and rain shell?

7) What are the boldest/spiciest french wines? Burgundy? 

8) Good pizza place in Paris? I come from NYC so I prefer big and cheesy...

9) Any pro tips on names of pastries we should try? 

10) Will a lot of cafes have mulled wine or is that something street vendors do?

In my opinion, this is [some smooth and mellow stuff](http://youtu.be/xHwWla5Cgxw).

As some/most of you know, the Rugby World Cup came to an end this week-end with the finale between New Zealand's All Blacks and the XV de France (New Zealand won, but not by much). 

Watching all these awesome games gave us (i.e. several redditors) an idea: why not organize a reddit rugby meetup? No, seriously, let's do this!

Weather forecasts for this week-end announce dry and sunny weather. I suggest we meetup Sunday 30 October in the afternoon. There's a football field right next to my place (in Rueil Malmaison, about 15 minutes away from Châtelet by RER) that's perfect for the occasion.

Don't worry if you don't know that much about rugby. We have some rugby experts at hand, and it'll mostly be about having a good time together. Hell, we can even invent our own rugby rules.

Let me know if you'd be up for this. It could be totally awesome. If there's enough interest, we'll settle on a meeting point and hour (and I will of course edit the post with all the information you need).

PS: Feel free to bring some friends, the more, the merrier!

I've accumulated 3 questions recently to ask you guys. 

1. Is the tap water in Paris safe to drink? Both in terms of sanitation and mineral content. I've noticed a lot of people buying large amounts of bottled water at the grocery stores. Is this because of sanitary or mineral content concerns? Should I also be drinking from bottled water or a filtered jug?

2. I am a student at the ICP. I realize since I am 23 years old, I can usually pay the youth (under 26) price if they are available. What I am wondering is, are there better discounts for students or student/youth discounts for all of Europe? If so, will I be eligible for them with my student card from school? Or are there special student discount cards I can apply for? I'd like to save as much as possible while travelling and living in general.

3. I'm an English speaking Canadian with a bachelor's degree. I'd really like to find a part-time job once I know what my class schedule's like. Since I am going to school 21h a week for french class, I'd like to find a job with 5-10h a week (most likely in the evenings) where I can be immersed in a french environment to quickly improve my french. I realize that babysitting is a popular choice (which I am not against), however I have no experience with children. As for teaching english (which I am also not against), I also have no experience, and I'd probably prefer something more immersed. Could you guys think of any other jobs I should be looking out for?

First of all thanks a lot for clicking this :)

So as mentioned in the title, I'll be living and working in Paris from June the 24th til September the 28th. I just came to know this last week, so my biggest concern at the moment is - where to live ?

I'm wondering if somebody of you rents out any furnished apartmets / knows somebody who does this ? I'd really appreciate it if you could help me find an apartment.

I'm a 21 year old male student, so I don't need/can't afford something big, I just need a decent place to stay.

**The other thing** is, I don't know anybody there :/ so maybe someone of you is willing to show me Paris ? Or just hang out ? Just message me and I will introduce myself more detailed.

So thanks a lot and I hope to hear from you soon.

EDIT: Hey there, 

first of all thanks a lot for your help ! 

It seems like I found an apartment thats available during my stay - so this problem is solved ! It's in the 10th Arrondissement and seems to be a nice place.

So thanks again, I really appreciate that.

If you're in Paris between Christmas and New Year's Eve, you should know the museum of the fairground arts is open to the public without reservation. This happens on rare occasions during the year and it's from the 26th of december to the 6th of January. I did it in september, I really enjoyed it and I don't mind do it again.

Here's a quick description found on the net :  
The Museum presents you a collection of merry-go-rounds, fairground shops and attractions restored, sets of historic works, 1522 independent works stemming from one of the biggest collections of fairground arts in the world.

Here's the official french website : http://www.arts-forains.com

I think non-french speaker will appreciate it, but there're a lot of shows only in french.

Don't hesitate to give us feedback.

I'm looking for someone to watch my bird for two weeks while I'm back home in the US. I will be gone Dec 20 - Jan 5. 

She is a cockatiel [[en]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockatiel) [[fr]](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockatiel), a small parrot.  She is affectionate, but very shy and doesn't bite. I'd prefer for her to be in a home without cats or dogs.  She must be in a home without other birds so that I can bring her back to the US when I leave France.

She is happier out of her cage, but she can stay in for most of the day if you're not comfortable with that. She will always be excited to see you when you come home. I'd like a petsitter to spend at least 15 or 20 minutes interacting with her each day -- petting her, talking to her. The rest of the time she will be happy to sit on your shoulder or on top of her cage. She needs to be covered each night.

You can have her in your apartment or visit mine every day / every other day.  I live in the south of the 7th.

I'll provide you with enough food for two weeks. You'll just need to give her food at least every other day, change the water in her water bottle every few days, and change the bedding on the bottom of her cage once.

I'll pay you for watching her.  We can discuss prices privately.

Requirements:

* Cannot be mixed with other birds
* Must be covered each night (or partly covered, if you won't be home one night)
* Non-smoking
* Understand English well so I can explain safety stuff.

Requests:

* No cats/dogs
* You've had a bird before or cared for one before.
* Be ok with a pet that can (and will!) fly"	t5_2qkoi	True

Hello! I need to send some stuff from Paris to New York, but I'm not exactly sure how to do that, let alone how much it will cost. What are my options?

I'm not too concerned about timeliness, so I don't need to pay to expedite the shipping or anything. 
So, what's the best way for me to do this? How much will this cost me? And more importantly, how do I go about doing this? I don't have a box or anything, so where can I get one?

Something about landing after a late night flight only to be welcomed with open arms and what we both want most cheese and wine.

Thinking the cliche, someone with our names on a sign. The person would greet us upon our inquisition over why he has our names on a sign and offer us our picnic to go (wich of course I'll be paying you back for and then some)

Figure a basket of sorts, bottles of wine (a red and a white), a corkscrew, a baguette, and some cheeses (we love our exotic and strange cheeses), any thing else that would be suggested. I'm not too sure what this would cost ideally around 30~40€ and I'd add an extra 20 or so for your trouble.

We have a few days to kill before our first farm (April 5th-7th) and a week to enjoy ourselves after the second farm (April 25th-May 2nd). Everything is located around Paris, so we will be flying to and from CDG. 


About us:

I've wanted to visit France most of my life and would like to stay away from most typical touristy things (though I wouldn't mind doing just a few). We are both 25 and live in San Francisco together. We like eating and drinking, art, music, movies, mainly hanging out and enjoying life. 


We ideally want to stay at a hotel those first two nights in Paris and was considering the area of Bastille. Is this a good spot for complete Paris newbies? Are there any good inexpensive hotels in that area? If we end up staying there, any restaurant/bar recommendations? Places we must see?


Near the end of our trip, we have exactly one week open to do whatever we want before heading back to SF. We wanted to stay in Paris half that time and maybe head off to Amsterdam or Brussels for a few nights. Are there any other districts in Paris that we must stay in? What would be another place to visit via rail on our trip that would be the best and most rewarding? More places to stay and see? 


I like to think of myself as very resourceful, but there is just so much info and I don't know enough to make these decisions. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!




Extra info:
The farms we are staying at are located in Courtonne-la-Meurdrac and Sacy-le-Petit.

Let me explain: I'm from México and I came to France for educational reasons. Before coming here, I bought a Laptop (2 months ago). The problem is that last friday my screen start displaying some blue lines, at first it was not so serious but now those vertical lines are all across the screen and getting wider, so sooner or later I won't be able to see. I don't know how this occured, maybe it was an accidental hit.

Anyway, I'd like to make phone call to customer service. The problem is that I don't have a phone and I don't speak too much french, so I'm basically asking for  someone who can make that phone call for me.

I need to know 4 things:
1.-If my warranty, that I got from Mexico, works here in France.
2.-How much would it cost to have my screen replaced.
3.-How much time would it take to have it repaired.
4.-Where and when I have to go to get this done.

I feel lost with this situation and this is the only thing I can come up with. Unfortunately I cannot afford a new lap and also It'll required a lot of time to set up a lot of things I already have in this lap which I need to work. I know reddit is a great community and any kind of help is highly appreciated.

I think I'll still try to go to the Louvre (at least to see the Venus de Milo and Mona Lisa) and also the Eiffel tower.  I've read that handicap people can cut the lines and go through the area for visitors with tickets.  I'm not sure if this would apply to me.

I'll be going in and out of Gare du Nord. I was planning on taking the metro but I read that this is not a good idea on crutches.  Is this correct?  It looks like buses get to all of these places too.

I'm thinking of spending a large chunk of time lingering/people watching at a sidewalk cafe.  It seems that these are a mix of what would be considered restaurants or cafes in the states and I'm not sure if its acceptable to linger there for a while.  In the states if you're at a place with waiter service then they'll push for you to leave right after you finish your meal.  Is this the same there?  Or can I just chill for a while with a coffee and not feel like I'm overextending my stay?

1. What would be good places to shop for clothes for a teen girl? Both my wife and daughter are not really interested in brand names, but they like original and quality clothes for a reasonable price.

2. Any restaurant recommendations in the 10th? Or elsewhere?

3. Any off the beaten track tips for a mother and teen daughter?

Any information is welcome.

Thank you everybody who took the time to answer! Some great information.

1328706743.0	pg6u8	Visiting Paris next week, a few questions...	Gandulph	10	4	20	"Hi /paris; me and my gf will be visiting your beautiful city next week; just for a week as we can't afford staying longer (euros are veeeeryy expensive for us) so I've been gathering information about places to visit, so we don't waste precious time deciding where to go or asking for directions.   
   
Of course one of the must-do things is visit the Eiffel Tower, but I just found out on ticket.toureiffel.fr that there's nothing available until Feb20 (we leave on the 19). Is that so? Or can we go to the tower, wait there, and buy the entrance? (I didn't even know that I could buy tickets online, I feel like an idiot for not checking this earlier).   
   
About the weather, currently in Argentina it's very very hot, yesterday we had 40°C temperature, and I know that you guys had the coldest day of the year a couple of days ago; so my question is.. would we be able to walk (we planned to walk a lot of course) with no problem or is it so cold there that it's barely possible to walk outside? The news here shows Italy, France and Germany desolated..  
   
I don't have any more questions, the FAQ and lots of posts about ""where to go"" helped us a lot already.

Just on an extended vacation, came here for convenience actually (to Paris for convenience, if you can believe it) because things had become stagnant in my native Houston, Texas. My sister (33) lives here with her husband who is here for business with Total. I flew in on October 11 and will leave January 10. So far, I have been bored and depressed and frankly, too hung up on a guy I love and not seeing the opportunity for what I objectively know it is. 

I'm here for another 72 days and I want to make it fun. At home here it's the same domestic life my sister had in Houston, a bored early morning-early night routine with people I honestly can't engage. I haven't enjoyed much I think largely for the reason that I'm not in very good company. Far from close with my cohabitants - sister, brother-in-law and nephew.

So! I want a friend to go do stuff with. Preferably a female, a fellow reasonable, not too stereotypical girl Redditor. Though I'm open to a guy. French native or foreigner. If you're a friendly English-speaking person under 35 I would love to explore the city with you! I like intelligent conversation, trying new things, some moderate alcohol drinking and trees, learning foreign language, all the things a typically adventurous person would be into. In fact my main goal for the last couple of years has been to travel extensively, and most of my money has gone to a fund for that purpose. I just haven't been feeling this trip, and I am sure that an engaging person, a friendly face would dramatically change this experience for me. I'm fun, I promise! I just need to break out of whatever shell I've found myself in.

Money: the fellow moms here have in large numbers expressed interest in my babysitting capabilities. I expect at least a few gigs in the next two weeks, which would mean at least 80-100 euros for spending. Right now I have just 12, so a meetup would be planned several days in advance. I expect these jobs to continue through to my departure.

Metro: Do you know how to navigate it? I believe I understand its basics, though I'll need some help on how the hell ticketing works. It still seems to confuse my sister, even after 14 months. Though I doubt this will be a big challenge. 

I'm a 21-year-old girl living in Paris until January, with only some babysitting responsibilities. This should be great fun, and I intend to realize it. 

Ideally, we would meet up somewhere and just explore for a day and feel each other out. Should that be enjoyable, we could continue our adventures at least a few more times. Interested? Tell me about yourself."	t5_2qkoi	True

At any rate, I'm looking for an apartment (found all the websites..lots of places available), but I just have one question for anyone with an opinion:

I hear that the 5th and 6th are ""the"" place to live for younger people (I'm 28, single, male, american, speak about 10 sentences of french), but the apartments there in my budget are TINY.  I've found some nicer, larger places near the Seine in the 11th which appeal to me cause of the space and the full kitchens (i like to cook and its a good way to save some money).  

Any thoughts?  Are the 5th and 6th worth the sacrifice in space/amenities?  Or are areas in the 11th (specifically near the Faidherbe-Chaligny metro) good and fun for someone like me, too?

First off, I have done a fair amount of research and know about all of the obvious attractions, but feel free to drop any must see/do items. 

I lived on L'Ile de la Réunion and Madagascar when I was 19-21, so I speak French pretty well, albeit I'm rusty and the occasions that I got to speak with mainland French were rare. I've kept up with some French internet radio off and on for several years on France Info and France Inter, but what I'd really like to know is if there are radio news or talk shows that are more specific to Paris. Something I could get an RSS feed of would be optimum. 

Above all, I'm wondering if anyone here might know where I should look to score some [pâte de piment](http://shop.laboutiqueantillaise.com/PATE-DE-PIMENT-ROUGE-ROYAL-BOURBON) from La Réunion.

She knows absolutely no one in Paris and has barely enough money to pay the rent (that's why she had to live in this shithole in the first place, but it got progresively worse). 

So I guess my question is what could she do in order to spend a couple of nights somewhere else in Paris? She can't afford an hotel and has to stay in the city for work... Maybe couchsurfing or something similar? I have no clue how to help her and she seems desperate, so any tip would be welcome. 

Thanks a lot. 

Edit - Ok so I guess couchsurfing is the way to go, she'll try that and I'll tell you how it goes. Anyway, many thanks for the support and the generous people who offered to help, you're all stand-up guys and gals.

* Walk around
* **Photography** (architecture)
* Middle Ages Museum (for the Lady and the Unicorn)
* Train to Beauvais to photograph the Cathedral (already paid for)

p.s. I butcher the French language very well. I learned this when I went to Montreal.

'Simili’ is a semi-fictional film about 4 nomadic people who, living in a city that is foreign to them, try to create a common space through language. By learning the youth language ‘Argot des Jeunes de la Cité’, they attempt to create a group identity, while the language itself concurrently eludes this appropriation.

1367357871.0	1dfsz5	Live 12 months for $25000 in Paris?	neringoskopa	7	1	13	"Bonjour! 

I am moving to Paris to work there for next year (12 months, not academic term) from the US. I won't be getting paid from the institution at which I am working, but I received a fellowship to pay for my expenses. My scholarship is 25,000 USD but I have the option to raise my scholarship amount if I can prove that it will be difficult for me to live (to an unspecified sum).

Since I have little support from my parents, college debt, etc., I would really like your honest input! Do you think 25, 000 USD for one person is fair for a comfortable living in an apartment  (studio or otherwise) in Paris for 12 months? If you had the opportunity to raise the scholarship amount, what would you raise it to? I want to be fair, but I also want to take every opportunity to succeed. 

Other info: 
I don't have many friends in the area, so I doubt I can live with a roommate. I also have to include flights in my budget. I am an EU citizen, so I don't have visa expenses. The amount above is not including taxes. I will have to pay for a few courses at my work institution and french classes, so that's in the budget as well. I'm no big spender, but I'm terrified of being alone in a foreign country and running out of my scholarship money. 

Any help would be so appreciated! Merci in advance. 

TDLR: Got 25000 USD for 12 mo in paris, can raise scholarship amount to unspecified but fair sum. What should I raise it to?

1366400854.0	1cp0wu	I'll be traveling solo all around France this Summer! Need any help? Wanna hang out? Got any must see places? Other? [X-Post from /r/travel]	Makks	7	2	11	"Hey r/Paris!

So all I'm sure of so far is that I'll be leaving for France sometime in May and I wont be back home in Austin Texas until the end of August. 

Depending on how I get there, I could have 3 whole months to explore the country if I go by plane, a bit under 2 months if I get there by boat (which is what I'm really pushing for!) or who knows how long if I decide not to come back at all :)

I've been talking to some yacht owners (which is super exciting!) about hitching a ride across the Atlantic. So far my best resources for traveling by yacht have been [Cruiser Log](http://www.cruiserlog.com/forums/) and [Find a Crew](http://www.findacrew.net/secure-server/eng/home.asp). I still think it'd be really cool to travel by container ship like [TinTin](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110701020807/tintin/images/1/19/Karaboudjan.jpg) but unfortunately from what I've found through some scant research doing so would be even more costly than traveling by plane - yet traveling by yacht can actually be cheaper, who would've thought! 

* For the record I don't have much sailing experience and have still found quite a few awesome boaters who are more than ok with that. A lot of them actually really like to teach what they know - awesome group of people cruisers are!

When I do finally get to France I'll be visiting with friends and family for a couple of weeks and that's where I'm at in my plan right now...

**Ideas So Far:** 

* I made [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/1ch9zj/help_me_plan_a_summer_2013_trip_to_france/) in /r/France which has inspired some great ideas, equally so in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/geology/comments/1ckidq/ill_be_in_france_all_summer_what_geological/) one I made in /r/Geology. 

* I think I might spend a month [WWOOFing](http://www.wwoof.org/), already paid the fee for the French list (http://www.wwoof.org/). Any recommendations on this? 

* Or I might do something with the [UCPA](http://www.ucpa-vacances.com/) which is a lot like a summer camp. 

^ Thanks Reddit! I wouldn't have known about any of these things without your help!

In the spirit of [a post by redditor Generique](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/svoy6/need_help_getting_something_done_i_have_unlimited/) I think it would be awesome to help and hangout with some fellow redditors in France or really close to it!

Know a sweet hiking spot (or a new restaurant!) but have no one to go with? Need an extra hand in the kitchen? Need help pulling off the best prank ever? Want me to bring you some *superior* California wine :P

Regardless, we have stuck together through so much and in a few weeks we are going on our very first trip together to Europe! 


My SO has always wanted to see Paris, but I keep telling her that unfortunately we do not have time in our schedule this trip. I do most of the planning, and I have secretly planned to have us make a 1 day 1 night stop in Paris to surprise her (I know... not very much time, but I feel like a short stop is best for now and next time I will take her to Paris for a week or longer!). 

I am using airbnb to find a place (have not settled on an area yet), and if anyone could be so kind as to work with me to share some ideas? I want to make this very special for her, and show her a true piece of Paris for her to take home in her memories. 

We arrive around 7am on a Friday and must leave shortly after the afternoon on Saturday. 

I have a general idea of what I'd like to do, I hope a kind soul here can help me flesh it out. I'd like to stay in a area where we can walk a lot and take in the beautiful buildings and environment, lots of random stores to explore, random unique little shops to look at things like scarves, rings, earings, jewelry, anything that is VERY ECCLECTIC as that is her style :)

We love to explore, and can spend hours going in and out of random boutiques, she LOVES sweets and desserts. 

After some exploring/shopping/snacking (which is really the magic of it all that I want her to experience), I'd like to find a really ""home"" and ""cozy"" place to have dinner, then walk around paris at night with a bottle of wine and 2 glasses (I know I heard it's illegal, but we will try our best to hide it). In my imagination, I envision us two walking down a cobbled street taking sips of wine, finding a lovely place with a nice view and sitting down, taking in the nighttime fresh air, and cozying up together while drinking some fine wine and enjoying the night.

Then of course, head back to wherever we are staying, and then wake up the next morning and just be happy that we are together, got the chance to experience a tiny bit of paris, then we get ready to leave to continue our trip :)

Much love and thanks in advance for any and all suggestions! :) The most important now is still: what area should I book my stay in?

You are between 25 and 50, male or female.
You were born anywhere, it doesn't matter: english is you mother tongue or you can speak it fluently.
You live in Paris or will stay in 2013 in Paris.
You have already played a role or have talent to play naturally and fluently.

Then you might want to play in my short film.

The topic of the film might be common like every Woddy Allen, Polanski, Hitchcock movies: lovers, murders, and a race against time. But the plot is not written like most short films: this story is intense, suspense is strong, and the structure is powerfull.
Therefore, I am looking for 2 men and 2 females (2 couples in the film) to play the 4 main characters. 

Who am I? I'm french, and I've been working in the commercial and feature industry for 7 years, on the visual effects side, now working in my own post-production company.
I'm now writting scripts as a hobby, and I am starting to go further by directing my first 25 minutes film.

This is not a student project, this is not a hidden porn production, this is a serious message from a feature film industry person.
Shooting will be in 2013 and last in total 5 days (not for every characters).

If you are interested, send me a photo and/or a reel if you have one, I will send you the script.

I can use pictures, videos, audio from my laptop (I would appreciate if you would bring your own earplugs, for better hygiene :-) ), texts (I own a printer)... newspapers... whatever...
So, it is not a conversation, not small talk, but specifically lessons to teach you vocabulary, use of verbs and expressions for everyday situations. Or it can be conversation on any given topic if you want.

Classes are to be held in small groups (max 4 persons for starter), preferably same fluency level, in public place in broad day light. Typically, a quiet café would be the perfect spot, or a library.
Please note that I would prefer classes to be held around La Défense, as it is closer to me.

If you feel bad about this whole free stuff, I accept tips, rounds, you being my wingman for nights out, whatever. In fact, I can never find people to go to karaoke with, so, who knows ?

If needed, you can make first contact with me over Skype, so I can demonstrate I am not a bot or a scam.

1347367811.0	zpf2d	I'm coming to your lovely city on Saturday and have some questions.	eaglessoar	11	4	20	"So I'm only there for 2 days and have been meticulously planning our itinerary. This.will be my first time here so it's all the major spots.

Saturday, get into airport at 730am, hotel is in the 7th, what's the quickest/most efficient way there? 

Day 1's plans are Orsay museum, Sainte Chappelle, notre dame, detour in the 4th on the way to Louvre, then Louvre most of the afternoon, down the champs-elysses to the arc and then back to the 7th for dinner and the Eiffel tower at night close to closing (I heard the lines die down then)

Thoughts on day 1? Am I missing anything around that area or nearby? Any smaller less famous but neat cool things around? Places to eat along the way not too touristy? Dinner in the 7th? 

Were taking a 930pm overnight train to Nice from Austerlitz so we're hoping to.drop our bags there in the a.m., they have places to lock them up? 

Then Day 2 after dropping the bags will be Pantheon, maybe les invalides then up to montmarte then up to the basilica of saint Denis (I love French medieval history) and finally back to the 5th for our train

How's day 2 look, any changes you would recommend? Anything else worth seeing in the 5th? Montmarte? Saint Denis? Where would be best for lunch?

Final most important question, where could I watch American football starting around 7pm around the 5th before our train? Chances of the train having a bar car with a tv and football?"	t5_2qkoi	True

1343350490.0	x7zz3	Paris compared to Vancouver, Canada - after a week's stay in Paris.	Celda	7	3	14	"Here are some observations after my girlfriend and I spent a week's vacation in Paris. Some of them may be somewhat inaccurate or ignorant due to the superficial immersion in French culture.

1. People in Paris are much more fashionable and better dressed, both men and women. I saw homeless people that looked the same as an average ""frat boy"" back home. 

2. Peanut butter is a rarity in France but a common staple in North America. Regular grocery stores don't have it, we only found one health food store (Biocoop) that had a few jars and it looked like this: http://i.imgur.com/6YGso.jpg

3. The toilet situation is terrible in France. You guys have the nerve to charge money for toilets, free toilets should be a universal human right IMO. 

It gets worse, we went to Provins (small village) and this is what the public toilets look like: http://i.imgur.com/b5TxU.jpg

Notice how there is no toilet paper, nor even a holder for toilet paper. **This is a toilet designed to not have toilet paper, it also didn't have soap.** Who the fuck designs a toilet without toilet paper?

4. Baguettes are much better / tastier, and much cheaper than in Vancouver. They are about 80 cents - 1 euro, an equivalent product in Vancouver would be $3+ and be worse quality.

5. Chatelet is fucking huge; we took 5 mins walking fast just to transfer between the purple line and the brown line. 

6. There were one or two snooty waiters, but the vast majority of regular people (and most of the waiters as well) were quite polite and friendly to us even though we are Anglophones. However I did attempt to engage in French (very limited French) so perhaps that made a difference. 

7. It is funny how you guys seem to tolerate known scammers no problem, 3 years ago I went to Paris and the black guys are scamming at Montmartre, now I return and the same guys are still there.

1343039347.0	x0dk1	scooter/moto insurance questions	hyde_	6	0	3	"Does anyone have any experience with scooter/motorcycle insurance in France ?  I have a little 50cc vespa here and I took a full coverage plan with assurance mutuelle de motards.  It's quite expensive, which I didn't mind since I was under the impression that it would cover most things.

I use the scooter infrequently and leave it parked on the street around my apt.  I have a standard U-lock antivol on the back wheel.  Recently I found that the headlight had been cracked, both mirrors (rétroviseurs) stolen, the seat/coffre forced (the lock is broken now), and on top of it all, the antivol won't unlock anymore.

So I was hoping that some of this would come back as covered under my insurance - I've payed almost half the scooter already in insurance...  Basically, since the ignition hadn't been forced, it doesn't count as a theft attempt.  Also, it doesn't qualify as vandalism (not sure what does).  The antivol might be covered if I call the roadside assistance, but apparently not, since the vehicle is within the minimum distance of my apt.  So basically, NOTHING is covered.

Is this normal ?  Do some of you have better insurance ?  I'm rather hoping that the thing gets stolen now, so that I can simply claim it and get my money back."	t5_2qkoi	True

Nullthread	7	1	7	"I am living here until April, and as any silly American metalhead, I want to see as many European metal shows as possible. I lack the money for festivals such like Roadburn, but I am a fan of the French black metal scene (DsO, Blut Aus Nord, Peste Noire, Celeste, to name a few at the top of my head) and wish to take in as much of it as possible. Yes I know Celeste is performing soon with none other than Deafheaven, but unfortunately, I won't be in Paris that day. 

So, on to questions:

1. http://www.glazart.com/date-2012-02-17-alcest-314.html
Anyone here going to see Alcest next week, and would like to meet up? I speak English and Spanish. Basic background I can disclose: architecture student, geek, metalhead, gamer.

2. Where/which venues, other than Glazart, host black, death, or doom metal shows (or heavy drone, experimental SunnO)))-type sounds?) Is there a dedicated record store for these sort of aesthetics? 

I have found general music stores that have a metal section (one was on St. Michael, but I forgot the name), but they were either too expensive or, dare I say, ""not metal enough."" Any information regarding metal/avantgarde music in general would be lovely. I am a consumer of weird sounds.

I'm a Canadian student filmmaker starting to edit my final production. We have a very short scene taking place in Paris, while most of it is inside, we need a shot to establish that it is Paris. There are places here in Toronto that look European, but it's not the same, it lacks that feel. What I need is a short 15-25 second shot of Paris, it can be anywhere really, but of course it would be nice if the Eiffel tower was in the shot, and really sell that it's Paris. And the better quality the footage the better, preferably 1080p.

I'll be in Paris in September for my honeymoon and was hoping to take my fiance to the opera de Paris one night.

1374252253.0	1in2f9	I need your help with my Paris Proposal!	parisproposal	8	3	11	"Hi Reddit! I've decided to propose to my girlfriend of almost 8 years (college sweethearts) when we take a trip to Paris this September. We agreed the trip would be in celebration of our 8th year together, but obviously she doesn't know I want to make it more special than that. It would be my first time in the beautiful city and I had originally planned on doing the proposal at the Pont des Arts, but now I fear that the proposal might be too cliche? She was the one who actually suggested we buy a lock and etch our names in it, toss the key into the river, etc. 

I was thinking along the lines of this in terms of the actual proposal:
*Giving her a small gift each day of our trip that would be sort of an adorable inside joke (eg. ramen noodles would be an example since we were dirt poor when we first met each other and she would always cook these noodles for me during our University years) along with a short handwritten note. Since we'll be in Paris for about 8 days, I could give her one note a day, each note representing a year in our 8 year relationship together, explaining the gift, or how much I love her, etc. and then the last note could be in French? And I could make her ask a stranger to translate the note for her when we're at the Pont des Arts? Possibly a Redditor? And the last gift would obviously be the engagement ring. Do you guys think this proposal idea at the Pont des Arts is not enough? I basically want to see her face like [this](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/jmT5iIFhNsGAr5dPSFDchcYiKD5xoAsvUM5hqupUVIGULG1ZaYSMlVrKI1XB2vjpui-wq6S4gwJqEme8QXDdwFg0wM1JdkE3E8VkTItba2o=w379-h379-n) when I get down on one knee and ask her to be mine for the rest of my life. If Reddit has any other ideas, I'm definitely open to hearing your suggestions!

Are any of you couchsurfing hosts or have any ideas?	dontforgetpants	9	4	12	"Hi r/Paris! As the title says, I am a traveler (25/F) going solo around Europe a bit this summer, and just booked the Eurostar from London to Paris for this afternoon (at 3:30), arriving at Gare Du Nord at 6 pm or so. I knew it's quite busy right now, but I figured I could find *something*... apparently that's not the case. I'm having particular trouble finding something at least just for tonight, and was wondering if any of you might have an open couch or spare room. I know it's a longshot, but from this subreddit it looks like most of you are quite welcoming to foreigners. :)

I am looking for a place where I will feel safe and welcome - not looking for sex or a free meal, just a place to crash for a night (maybe 2). In exchange, I can buy you dinner or coffee, or tell you about my hometown (Austin/Houston, Texas). Other cool things I can tell you about: bikes, energy, and nerd things! I used to know a bit of French but it is VERY rusty and I'd love to learn more. I can link you to my couchsurfing profile for more info. I'll be online for the next couple hours trying to find something on CS or AirBNB (though a lot of it is out of my price range), so please PM me if you have any ideas or can help out. 

Edit: Bonus points if you want to hang out tonight/tomorrow and show me some cool secret-Paris stuff!

I would prefer a B'n'B or a small hotel. I get to see enough clinical hotel chains during my work-related travels, and would really like to try a smaller, more atmospheric place.

Location does not matter very much. I probably have overly romanticized notions about Montmartre, the Left Bank in general and 6th arrondissement specifically, anyway. In any case, I like walking around strange cities. I love science, history, musty books and the arts, and museums with exhibitions related to any or all of the aforementioned.

I'm a 23 year old, male, Canadian, university graduate. I arrived in Paris Jan. 3rd to spend a year with my mother, learn the French language and culture, and figure out what I want to do in the next few years of my life. I have some random questions that I would appreciate answered.

1.  I'd like to find a gym either close to home (metro stop Sevres-Lecourbe) or to school ICP (metro stop Rennes). Are there ones you would recommend or ones I should avoid?

2. I love playing basketball and dodgeball. Are there any adult recreational leagues I could join? Also, where's the best place to buy a decent indoor/outdoor basketball?

3. I'm also thinking about the possibility of pursuing post-graduate studies in France in the future. Can somebody please explain to me the difference between universities and les Grandes Ecoles? Also, does post-bac mean after high school? I was thinking about attending [this](http://www.admission-postbacidf.fr/) event, but if it's for undergraduate studies then I won't bother.

4. Finally, what are some subtle differences in social etiquette I should be aware of? For example, according to my mother, it is impolite to not open a present immediately upon receiving it. While in my experience, presents are often opened immediately in North America, it would not have been impolite to not do it unless the gifter specifically requested it. What about dating?

The good...

- The architecture of the buildings in the city are amazingly beautiful. 

- People are very friendly. Forget about the stereotypical rude Parisian. They have been nothing but nice and accommodating.

- If you know how to say 'bon jour' and 'merci', that's enough. The minute you try to say 'bon jour', they know you don't speak French and they will help you along.

- The wine is delicious. Even if you don't like wine (like myself), do yourself a favor and try it.

- I hear a lot about scams and pick pocketing, but I've seen none of that. Overall, I feel very safe in Paris. Much safer than any large U.S. city. 

- The night life is great. If you are young and good looking, you'll love it. Parisian women are beautiful, and that's an understatement. Then men are good looking too, speaking objectively.

- The coffee is really good, and strong (think French press). 


The bad...

- The French are annoyingly polite. We've all heard about it, but now that I'm here I am damn sick of the words 'bon jour' and 'merci'. i hate that pressure to be polite, and if you're not they will throw it in your face.

- Parisians walk fast. Everyone seems to be in a rush to get where they're going. Relax already!

- The touristy sites are crowded (no surprise) and it really takes the specialness out of it.

- If you are overweight, you will be very uncomfortable in Paris. Everything is small, and some people will look at you like a freak show attraction.

- The beer selection kind of sucks.

- Everyone dresses nice in Paris. That's a bad thing because I don't like to dress up. 

- I've not been that impressed by the food. Go to a diverse city in the U.S., such as NYC, and you will find much better food.


Summary...

- The best thing abut being in Paris is experiencing the French culture and visiting the historic sites.

- The worst thing about being in Paris is the annoying politeness. That sounds trivial, I know, but seriously just give me a damn apple without going through the whole bon jour/merci process."	t5_2qkoi	True

Idoitforthetitties	6	1	7	"So I will try to keep this brief, but let me start out by saying that if I can pull this off everyone here is of course invited.

So I go to a small American School here in Paris and we are in need of some fundraising, so we naturally concluded that a Halloween party could be a smashing success with an American twist. The main problem we have is space. We would like to find a venue in which we could host as many people as possible, but no one's apartment is fit for a proper American style Halloween house party(I'm not even sure that such an apartment exists in Paris unless you are Jay-Z wealthy), and we don't really have funds to rent out a large venue. Has anybody tried to do something like this before, heard of something like this before, or does anyone just have some ideas in general? 

The party would have things like a costume contest, beer pong tournament, Jungle Juice, Candy, and all-around general debauchery. We would ideally use it to raise funds by charging a small cover.

I'm not sure if this is even practical or possible, but any thoughts or suggestions on anything are most welcome. I thank you in advance.

I'm a photographer staying here until late October.

I know official protests on the matter have been banned, but this doesn't mean something won't still happen. So, my questions:

1. Does anyone know of Twitter feeds or Facebook pages for groups that might organize such events?
2. Are their particular locations that tend to get protests, or where protests start? For example, the US embassy had protests last weekend, but I'm thinking the magazine might be a more likely place this weekend. Maybe a certain mosque tends to organize more? Etc....

Any info would be appreciated.

1346771928.0	zc797	Girlfriends birthday in Paris - great places to eat and/or visit?	Not_A_FakeAccount	8	3	9	"So the end of November / early December my partner and I will be visiting Paris for a few days. It also happens to be her birthday. We're staying in a hotel only a stones throw away from the Eiffel Tower. We'll be doing the typical tourist things, seeing the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame, Moulin Rouge, etc. Are there any places that anyone can recommend that aren't on the typical tourist hit list?

Also, I'm wanting to take her out to dinner for her birthday. I've gone through a list of ""best restaurants in Paris"", there are some lovely sounding ones but I thought I'd get some local input. So, r/paris, are there any decent places you can recommend to eat? I'm not bothered on price but nothing too expensive (eg &gt;£100 each)."	t5_2qkoi	True

Google seems to say that pedestrians are free to cross, as I'd expect.  But when I've tried that, oncoming traffic has honked and gestured at me before. And I don't mean that I'm jumping out in front of a car that can't reasonably slow down.

Right now we are pretty open with our options for when we'll go to Paris. We want to save and plan for the best possible trip that we can afford in the next 6-12 months.

Questions:

We have a few options for when to visit based on our schedules: Mid-February, Mid-April or for our actual 1 year anniversary in early July. What option would be the best time to visit? 

We're hoping to budget at $3,000 for flight, accommodations, and food for 2 weeks. We're planning to use a studio apartment on airbnb to save money and only eat out once a day. Does anyone have any general advice on other ways we could cut down costs?

1341964821.0	wcuw4	American visiting Paris for a few days, questions!	thegalaxist	7	3	23	"Hi guys, sorry to bother you with another one of these posts, but I have some basic questions/concerns that I didn't see addressed in other threads I read.

I'm a college student ultimately going to Copenhagen, but I've chosen to fly into Paris about a week before I need to be Copenhagen as I've never been to Europe and would like to see France. I'll be there in mid/late August. I have an 8-day/4-country Eurail select pass to get me from France to Denmark and hopefully make some stops along the way.

Anyway, questions:

* First and foremost: I'm flying into CDG at ~11am local time, then what? Where's the best place area of the city to find a hostel/hotel that's not going to be super crowded? I don't need a room with a beautiful view. A tiny, cheap room in a quieter neighborhood would be cool. Should I stay near the airport area for a bit? Is there anything to see there, or should I immediately go to a different part of the city? 

EDIT: I found [Hotel Eldorado](http://www.eldoradohotel.fr/) on [Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/biz/hotel-eldorado-paris). It sounds great! What do you think of the location? 

* I don't speak French. What I've gathered is that I should learn basic French phrases (""Hello"", ""I'm sorry"", ""I don't understand"", I don't speak French"", ""Sorry to bother you"", ""Do you speak English?"", ""Can you help me?"", ""Please"", ""Thank you"", etc), make an effort to use them, and be polite. Are there any key phrases I can't live without?

* I'm not into touristy stuff. The goal of the trip is to see my friend in Copenhagen -- I chose to come a little early so I could go to France just because. I like to eat and drink and walk around and do nothing. 

* I see you've compiled a list of your favorite bars! What's the attitude towards day drinking? Are there any regional drinks I should try while I'm there?

* Do you have a similar list of recommendations for coffee/simple/cheap food/ etc? I've seen enough dinner-restaurant recommendations on this subreddit, I'm more curious about lunch/to-go-food/sandwiches/etc.

* What's the smoking etiquette? Can I leave butts on the ground like in the US, or is that rude/illegal? How/where do I buy cigarettes and how much should I expect to pay for a pack? 

* Should I stay in Paris the whole time, or are there any cool towns/cities between France and Belgium that I should go to?

* What's the weather like in mid-late August? weather.com says mid-seventies at the highest. That would be great, because I don't really wear shorts. 

* I generally wear slim-fitted dark jeans and khakis with plain/casual button-down shirts. Leather chukka boots and oxfords in terms of footwear. Overall, pretty neutral -- I'm not going to stick out like a sore thumb, am I? I'm not concerned with looking like a local, I just don't want to be a target.

* Should I get a Metro pass and visit many parts of the city or just find a nice place, stay put, and travel on foot? 

Sorry for the wall of text! I lost my train of thought there at the end, but I think I covered most of the basics. 

Anything else I need to know? 

Thanks so much!"	t5_2qkoi	True

1341756753.0	w7zap	Where to study in Paris	HOBrFINCl	7	1	13	"Greetings reddit,

I am just working on my undergraduate degree now in Canada. However it is my dream to get my doctorat in Paris. I have several questions, for which any answers would be greatly appreciated!

I will start with some background information. I am currently studying Molecular Biology and Genetics in Ontario Canada and have lived in Canada for my entire life/was born here. However I visited Paris and absolutely loved it. As I have dream about getting my Ph.D in genetics for some time, and now dream of living in Paris I figured why not get two birds with one stone?

* Would Paris be a good place to get a good education in science, knowing that I would like to go into research.
* Would it be wise to get my masters in Paris, or stay in Canada for the time being?
* Which University would be best for science/the fact I would be international.
* Does it cost a lot more (strictly education costs) than other countries in the world?
* Which University would you recommend? 

Thank you very much to anyone that has any answers to any of these questions. I very much want to hear recommendations about Universities.

I am a photographer who is going to be in Paris from the 15-20th of this month, and I decided to start my search here. 

I have heard that Couch surfing hosts in Paris get inundated with requests at the first sign of spring, and I didn't want to be another drain on the site, so I wanted to try and find someone who is also on reddit. 

My sister and I are traveling to France to surprise my grandparents, who are celebrating their 60th wedding anniversary. My sister is a theater technician and I am a freelance photographer, and we are both from Minnesota. 

In exchange for hosting, I would love to take the portraits of you or someone you know. Check out my website here: http://alihaupt.com/.

Last year, I bicycled through Germany and was profiled in a German magazine about my couchsurfing experience. [I am on the top left](http://imgur.com/NmAE3). Here is what the article says:
On Two Wheels Across Europe
Alison (23), Minneapolis
The photographer rode straight from Stockholm to Prague, naturally from couch to couch. We caught her in Dresden. Alison is excited about the guest-friendships she has come to know everyday. Her hosts helped her plan, and even accompanied her in stages.
