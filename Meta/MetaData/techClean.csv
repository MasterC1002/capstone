I have been getting a dialogue box telling me my copy of windows 7 may be counterfeit. I called them and they tried giving me new serials for awhile, and it still didn't take away the message.

Now they have changed tact - telling me it is not a valid home copy (home edition...) therefore I need to take it back to the retailer and get them to swap it - like Costco would do that after 18 months!? 

Any ideas of what I can do? How can I tell Microsoft I've paid for my copy on the high street, been the only user, Andy copy had been sat in a box since installing?

Technologists would pirate MS products left-and-right, and take their knowledge to businesses, who would license them. This was a good time for everyone, including Microsoft. Their business of repackaging the same Office suite year after year was lucrative, and their company yielded the richest CEO on the planet. Microsoft was happy, people who used their products personally were happy, businesses were happy. Everyone was happy.

Then came Windows 95. This was the first time Microsoft introduced *The Registry*, and with it, the concept of indisposable system files that couldn't be simply moved to a new image. It was also the first OS that was aware of the hardware it was running on, and required a DRM key to activate when it detected enough hardware had changed out from under the OS-layer. Technologists did their best to adapt, but it started going downhill right **there**.

Fast-forward to today. I'm wondering what I'm still doing supporting Microsoft software. When a hard drive starts to go, it's no longer as simple as moving the data to another drive and fixing corrupted dll files. This used to be so easy, Microsoft. Why is it that Linux distributions, which nobody is making money through direct development and sales, able to do this simple, rudimentary task, and the most cutting-edge Windows technology has lost it? Why, after Google lit the path to righteousness by selling ads around their free (as it should be) software? Why is it seventeen years later, and I'm still hopeful that the ""Fix startup problems"" option on my Windows 7 disk will actually *fix startup problems* instead of wasting a half hour of my time?

To top it off, every time a business buys Microsoft products, they're subsidizing dick moves like Microsoft's lame attempt to make the web a proprietary technology (Internet Explorer).

Fuck you, Microsoft. I'm no fortune teller, but I can predict your future. Take your Windows Phone and shove it up your ass.

My bedroom has blackout curtains to keep out the streetlights, but if I want to sleep in the dark I have to leave all technology out of the room. Since I was a kid I've been turning my alarm clock on its face to hide all that bright red or green. Now I use my phone as my alarm, but my phone has a little green light that blinks when it's charging, so I turn that face down too (somehow this has silenced my alarm before, which sucks). Recently I got a portable AC unit specifically to stay cool while I sleep, and it has a blue backlit control screen. Even if I cover the screen with tape, the light seeps out through all the cracks in the case.  

Worst of all is my laptop. It has lights on the back to show that it has power. It has a little light on the front to show that it has wifi (this blinks constantly). So, I hibernate it, well guess what? Now the back lights PULSE to show it's charging! Even if I turn the thing off, the power cable lights up blue to show it's getting power! My ps3 and sound system have little red lights TO SHOW THAT THEY'RE OFF! 
 
Am I the only one who thinks this is ridiculous? There's GOT to be a better way! ([cue cheesy infomercial](http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/626737c84a/infomercial-hell)) Could we at least have a switch, or a mode to turn off all lights on our electronics? Ugh! [/rant]

I'm going to buy a HDTV for my computer and I want to raise the comp off the floor. I have an Alienware Aurora which is 45lbs 16.7"" H x 25""D x 10""W.  It is a big black monster.  and i also have two little speakers and a small subwoofer. 

Questions:
 
1. I have a hot water pipe running through my bedroom.  Will having the TV and comp near them be a bad idea?

2. What should i do with all the wires?

3. Comp has wireless internet, will pipe or other factors (height) effect wireless efficiency?

4. Any ideas how I can cover the comp up so that it is not some big ugly monster on the wall without harming its heat displacement?

How do computers consistently and predictably improve over time?	geo141	13	3	9	Obviously computer manufacturers release the best possible computer with each new iteration, arriving at new limits preventing them from releasing anything more powerful, yet ever-so-mundanely they break those limits in only a few years. We all expect Intel and AMD to release a better computer chip, but isn't it absurd for us to expect that?  It's not like people expected *electricity* to happen, or expected *the wheel* to happen, all these things required magical insights that no one could have predicted. Technological innovation is kind of a random event, it takes a spark of ingenuity to occur in someone's brain, which no one ever can truly know will occur.

You see, it's one of the HP minis, so it has no disc drive, so we had to find a way around it.  What we did was used Wubi, and then we used that program that gives wubi it's own partition.  Then, we used Lubi to get rid of Window's 7.  Then, instead of enlarging the OS, she changed the partition of Ubuntu entirely, rendering the computer entirely unbootable.  We tried everything in the 'USB booting' department, but we can't seem to get it to boot over USB for whatever bloody reason.
So, I discovered this little OS hidden in her computer's boot menu called HP Quickweb- maybe you've heard of it.
What we're wondering is, is it possible to install Ubuntu from Quickweb and end her computer's woes?  This has just been a headache, and we're running out of things to try."	t5_2qh48	True

We have metal support posts - the kind that are embedded in the concrete and holding up the main floor joists.  Two of them are spaced about 3 feet apart, and she sees a huge spark jump between them.

I've asked a friend/electrician if he's heard of this, and he has no idea.  I'm an electrical engineer, but have no clue how a house is wired for something like lightning.

Should I be worried?  Should I be calling someone serious to come and check it out?

1372628412.0	1hdxc0	[Question] Trouble installing new OS on Windows 8 computer	Mr-Rainbow_narwhal	12	5	5	"**You can skip down to the bottom if you want, I'll bold the question and any information that I think may be important** 
***
I have a laptop that was preinstalled with Windows 8. Once you learn the trackpad shortcuts and get used to the new start screen, it's actually far better than most people say it is; however, I still find it frustrating and want to change my OS. 

#I've downloaded the Ubuntu version 13.04 64 bit disk image and burned it to a CD-R. From the disk I ran `wubi.exe` and selected the normal computer reboot option, and during reboot the disk didn't even register. I tried again, this time selecting the ""Help me boot from CD"" option. This time, after reboot, after I clicked Ubuntu at the OS selection (it did register this time) Windows Bootup Manager gave me an error saying that it couldn't load the OS because it was missing the file. The complete error message was as follows:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Starting Windows didn't succeed. The reason may be changing software.

    To solve this problem:
        1. Insert installation disc of Windows and reboot pc
        2. Choose language settings and click Next
        3. Use Repair

    If you don't own this disk contact with the administrator.

    File: \ubuntu\winboot\wubildr.mbr
    State: 0xc000007b
    Information: Could not load application or Operating System because of the lack of the required file or errors in this file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I tried again and it gave me the same error message. I figured it either downloaded or burned wrong, so I downloaded the disk image again and made a LiveUSB out of it.

 Again, I had the same problem of it not registering after restart.

 Again, I tried the ""Help me boot from CD"" option. 

Again, I got the same missing `\ubuntu\winboot\wubildr.mbr` error. 

Well, maybe it was just an error with the actual files in that version, it was only released about 2 months ago, it could still be buggy and they may not have been able to fix it yet. I downloaded the Ubuntu version 12.04 64 bit disk image this time instead of version 13.04 and burned it to a different CD-R. With high hopes I ran `wubi.exe` and during boot up, the disk didn't run. No surprise there. You know the drill by now. Again, the same dreaded missing `\ubuntu\winboot\wubildr.mbr` error from Windows Bootup Manager. Sadly, the Ubuntu through-current-operating-system installer does not have support for Windows 8.

So by now I know that there's an issue, an issue far beyond the control whatever I could do with those CD's and USB, an issue far beyond the control of however I tried to run the installation applications, an issue far beyond the control of how many times I tried installing the Operating System. I had heard of a suspiciously unrealistic-sounding new feature to Windows 8. A new feature, supposedly implemented in 2012, called Secure Boot. Curious, I opened Windows Powershell and ran the boolean command `Confirm-SecureBootUEFI`. I was hoping for the familiar, bright red ""`The term 'Command-Term/' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.`"" or at least `False` or `Cmdlet not supported on this platform`. The terminal processed the command successfully, and returned a bright white, courier, `True`

^^ಠ_ಠ

^^^God.

^^^Damnit.

For those of you who don't know, Secure Boot is part of the UEFI of machines with Windows 8. Secure Boot prevents your computer from booting any Operating System besides Windows 8, or in best case scenarios deters it and makes it the most difficult pain in the ass you will ever experience. If you have a machine that came with Windows 8, you will most likely never be able to load up a new operating system the easy, normal way. For context, imagine that crazy ex girlfriend that you broke up with. Now imagine her with a knife, a lot of ropes and chains, padlocks, and a dark soundproofed basement. Now name her Windows 8, shove her in your computer, and imagine trying to break up with her for this hot, exotic girl you met named Ubuntu the easy, normal way, especially after telling her that she has to share the computer with this chick. 

Yeah. The people who yell at sheeple for supporting Micro$oft, as ridiculous as they are, may have a point.

I'm pretty sure that Secure Boot is the issue I'm having when trying to partition my harddrive. I realize that I could always back up my files, completely reformat my harddrive, and load Ubuntu from that most likely without a problem, but I don't want to completely lose Windows 8 until I'm familiar with Ubuntu and know that I want it.

So, if any of you could find something else that may be the issue from the information given, then that would be great just in case I'm trying to fix the wrong thing. I guess the question I'm trying to ask is: **Is there a way to disable Secure Boot? Secure Boot is a new UEFI feature in Windows Operating Systems that prevents/deters any operating system besides Windows from booting. I run Windows 8 on an HP Pavilion g4. Thank you to anyone who helps, attempts to help, or even just had the intention of helping.**"	t5_2qh48	True

Jetzki	13	6	8	"I live in China where youtube is blocked and residential internet speeds aren't the best, combine the two and you get a really hard time uploading to youtube, sure I could use a proxy or vpn, but that tends to slow things down even more than they already are.

If I go out to the net cafe round the corner from my apartment, I get 1hr of 50mb up for the price of a can of coke. Can't get on China blocked sites from there though. I would really like to make use of this fast upload speed.

I know that youtube can receive video via email, so I've been thinking about emailing videos to them, but then you get hit by attachment size. I was looking at skydrive, dropbox and etc to see if I could upload to them and then send the video to email as an attachment, but they all give download links. Google drive can send video to youtube, but it's also blocked in China.

Does anyone know of any service at all that will allow you to send video to youtube? I think I remember seeing something on twitch.tv that would let you sync your twitch videos to youtube, but my content isn't gaming.

I've been reading through this https://developers.google.com/youtube/2.0/developers_guide_php#Direct_Upload to see if I can make something on my own web server that will do it for me, but I am terrible at coding and it's taking me a while to figure out."	t5_2qh48	True

1370971217.0	1g4swv	An idea of how to defeat government surveillance once and for all	dingoperson	8	3	5	"Defeating government surveillance once and for all: An idea


**INTRODUCTION**

Here's my idea. Please note that I am not inherently opposed to the idea of government surveillance of any kind. Detecting people trying to blow up buildings is a good thing. 

Unfortunately it turns out that the people this tool was entrusted to just couldn't control themselves. They just had to push it, and push it, and push it. And that's in pretty much all countries. Since the tool ends up causing more harm than good, it has to go. 


**THE BASIC PREMISE OF MASS SURVEILLANCE**

Let's be a bit reductionist and imagine two avenues. 

One avenue is stock surveillance. You gather up a database of everything someone has done in their life. Then you correlate that information. If they reach a particular score, you treat them differently. Or you use it for other purposes. Presidential challenger John called a criminal defense lawyer 20 years ago? Maybe the current powers do a bit of investigating to dig in his laundry. 

Another avenue is flow surveillance. You scan people's communications in real time to pick out key words. Certain phrases will flag you for suspicion. 

Regular efforts to obscure communication are self-defeating without a critical mass. If you are the only person encrypting your communications, then that alone places you in the ""suspicious"" category. 



**HOW TO STOP MASS SURVEILLANCE**

You work to reach a point where a lot of people have on their computer a utility that uses a small amount of bandwidth at all times to randomly send illicit and suspicious content to everyone else with that utility, as well as make dubious search requests. At the same time, the utility has functions to allow non-random transmitting and to record what is received based on manual choice. 

For example: Bob wants to transmit a message to Adam: ""drugs are at my cabin"". Bob's utility will already randomly connect to people based on randomised user IDs transmitting messages about guns, drugs, explosives, celebrity names etc. But he specifically sets it to transmit this message to Adam based on Adam's specific user ID. Adam has set his to store any messages received from Bob specifically and discard any others. An external observer cannot know if the connection was made randomly or intentionally.

What about incidence analysis? If communications between Adam and Bob are far more regular than random chance? You just need to mimick regular communications with randomness. The utility might randomly attach to particular user IDs and transmit only to those for a while. For a period of time it may get fixated on certain terms (""undetectable knife"") and use those a lot. It may use a small bit of space to transfer entire documents. The goal is just to mimick intentional behavior as closely as possible by randomness.



**HOW TO REACH CRITICAL MASS**

Good question. Drive-by downloads? BitTorrent clients? Highly useful utilities developed by volunteers? Short-lived public attention? Who knows.

So I picked up an 8GB Flash Drive and wanted to make a USB Toolkit for both home &amp; office use.  I've done some searching, and noticed one hindering factor in my decision: There are MANY portable apps that offer the same service, and I'm unfamiliar with a good portion of them.     
So, what I have been able to decide is I'd like it to be bootable to a lightweight Linux OS (Fedora, Puppy, whatever) if unable to boot to Windows, as well as have a couple basic tools I already use and like (CCleaner, Defraggler, Speccy, Recuva, DBAN) and I'd like to have use of other functions like a backup utility, memory test, anti-virus/malware, basically any useful tools for troubleshooting/monitoring.  I'd like to hear what you fine folks already use/recommend so that I can have a better understanding of what choices to make (or which to avoid.)  Or, how do you guys feel about the app suites like PortableApps.com?  I know some things in those suites are just fluff, but I figured certain things could be useful (web browser, office apps).  Any help is greatly appreciated!  
**Edit:** Thanks a ton for the suggestions, really appreciate the help here considering there's a lot of options to choose from.  Although now I find myself trying to decide between the options suggested here.  I'll likely take some time this weekend to just try each out and see what I prefer.

1362887686.0	1a09sj	I kill technology. Seriously, I hold something electronic in my hand and it crashes. How the hell is this possible?	iamnotstephanie	11	6	7	"I don't know that is exactly the place for this but here goes

I swear that I don't do anything dangerous or stupid or whatever with any devices. I don't do anything wrong! That doesn't matter though, because whatever electronic device I am using will inevitably fail at some point. And this really sucks.

I had an iPod touch. Froze the first day I owned it and many times after. It wasn't just a bad one, I've used others' iPods and they often freeze when I hold them. It wasn't even a year before it stopped working altogether.  

Then I got a keybo phone, and it worked okay for a while (I've noticed that the simpler a device is, the better I get along with it) until it decided to NEVER delete any more messages EVER. That made using it irritating. 

Then I got a blackberry 9860, which I was really excited about. It only worked for like, 5 days. It's battery would only a few hours, and then after a couple of days of dealing with that, it suddenly got really hot. Too hot for me to hold. Then, when the battery finally died I plugged it in and charged it and it worked for an hour before it crashed and flashed the red LED, lit up the trackpad, and flashed an hourglass on the screen one at a time until the battery died again. I called help numbers, talked to my local electronics people, everything, no one could figure out how it went from a functioning, brand new phone one day to a piece of crap the next. I told myself it was just a dud.

I got a replacement phone, this time a blackberry 9810. It seemed better... for a couple of weeks. I had just unplugged it after charging it, and I turned it on. It turned on briefly and shut off on its own and didn't turn on again. Ever. I took it back and was given a replacement battery, they told me that it must have been a surge of power that fried the battery when it was charging. Except how did I turn it on to begin with? The new battery works okay, the phone regularly freezes and I often find myself restarting it. I didn't have bbm for two weeks once, it just disappeared and came back. Other than that, I still use it.

At some point, I got a kobo touch ereader. Awesome thing, except for the random freezing. Thankfully that isn't very frequent and it is still functioning. 

I have an awesome laptop that has almost never failed me. Once the screen did stop working in spots but they slowly ""healed"" themselves. Occasionally the internet connection fails when everyone else in my house has no problems. 

Then 6ish months ago I saved up and purchased a samsung galaxy player 4.2 for myself. I love it. It has always worked perfectly, until yesterday. The internet won't work in almost all of my applications except for instagram and the browser (not sure why those two), though when I use the browser it constantly pops up with a message that says something about an insecure something or other (I can't remember what it was). I have tried EVERYTHING. This is such a betrayal.

My family won't let me share their electronics because they don't want me to ruin them. Once, my phone was charging so I borrowed my mom's phone so that I could google something to show my friend, and my mom didn't want me to use it. I assured her that I would be fast. I had only gotten to the google homepage when it froze. I only held it for like, maybe 10 seconds when it froze. My friend thought it was hilarious. The phone started working again after my mom restarted it. 

My aunt doesn't use technology, but she always wears a watch, and she has to put a couple layers of tape on the back so it doesn't touch her skin, otherwise she kills the watch. I've never worn a watch, but I'm thinking I would do the same. So, what ever this is seems genetic. 

But really, what is this? Does anyone else have these problems? How do I make it stop? I've tried researching, and all I've found is a few other people like me who say it's their aura or they're ""psychic"" or ""telekinetic"". Some even said it was because they had a stronger attraction to the planets or something like that. But come on people. There's got to be a reasonable, scientific explanation."	t5_2qh48	True

1361002879.0	18mp5s	Ask Tech: A device that can detect cellular broadband via USB card?	drumdude656	8	1	2	"First off, please excuse my lack of technical terminology. I'm going to do the best I can to describe my situation and if it isn't clear just let me know and I will try to reword it.

Here's some background: 

At my place of employment there is a significant amount of down time and I often use that time to study for school. Those that directly supervise me have no problem with me using my laptop and plugging in my Sprint U600 USB card to access the internet for homework purposes. However, lately there have been issues with people accessing social media sites via smartphones/personal hot spots, and the administration (that does not directly supervise me) has been cracking down on internet usage during work. One of my many supervisors mentioned to me that she believes that the administrative personnel that has an office in the back of my work area may have a device that can detect wireless internet access and record the amount of time that an internet connection was in use.

So my question, tech, is whether or not such a device exists? I've tried looking around online but I don't know what it would be called and therefore can't find anything. I do not use my laptop during administrative hours, so it would only be an issue if it is indeed possible to record when the internet connection was in use. 

Also, a follow up question...

I'm going to be switching to a mobile hot spot in the next couple weeks. So if it isn't possible to detect a connection via my Sprint U600, will it be possible to detect internet access via mobile hot spot?

Thank you so much for your advice to come. Also, if you think there is a more appropriate subreddit to ask this question just let me know."	t5_2qh48	True

1357394948.0	160a1h	USB 3.0 question -- multiple devices, one port	leftnose	11	5	2	"OK, sort of a weird question.  I just got a new laptop but it only has one USB 3.0 port.  I'm a pretty hardcore desktop user so I really only use the laptop when I'm travelling and when I travel I also like to take photos.  But, with my camera, depending on how I have it set-up, one photo can be anywhere 7-30 MB of data, generally in the low 20s.  Because I'm also a belt and suspenders kind of guy, I like to back my photos up while still on the road.  So, I carry a card reader and external hard drive.  Both of these happen to be USB 3.0.  In the past, both were plugged into USB 2.0 ports and I just dealt with the slow transfer speeds.

Now, finally to the question, since the new laptop has a 3.0 port, would it be worthwhile buying a 3.0 hub and connecting both card reader and HD to that?  Will I get faster-than-2.0 transfer speeds?  Or will the bus bog down with all the I/O on the one port?  Would I just be better off connecting one device to the 3.0 port and the other to a 2.0 port?

**TL;DR:** What's the best way to handle using multiple USB 3.0 devices and intensive data I/O when only one port is available?"	t5_2qh48	True

I need your help for research for my dissertation.

I'm researching the sort of interactions people have with tablets/smartphones/laptops when they're using them as a secondary screen e.g. when watching TV, gaming, at museums etc. Also a bit about using them in educational settings.

Would really appreciate if you would like to take part in my user study by filling in a questionnaire, should only take about 5 minutes.

It seems to me that it started when I updated Adobe Shockwave Flash Player. 

If I click on a video on here, on news site, or on YT  it will play but with no sound *initially*. But, after 45-60 sec (maybe more) the sound starts up and from that point on, I don't have a problem with subsequent video clip viewing...unless I close down the computer and start up my computer again. 

On some sites like Yahoo news, I can't view videos at all I just get the loading symbol twirling around. I wait up to a minute and then get frustrated and just leave that site. 

I use AT&amp;T internet service, the lowest plan which download speed is 3 MBPS. 

My speaker volume and video volumes are set at 100%.

So, do I have 2 separate problems? Is it my internet service, the Shockwave player or another program that might be causing this sound lag and video lag? I'm not too techy but any simple instructions/advice would be appreciated. Thanks.

""Apple was always an innovative company, as it is today. But innovation is not enough. Business model is more important. Apple created the Windows-style OS, but Microsoft became the world's largest software company with Windows. Not because it was a better product, but because they opened the platform and thousands of companies (both hardware and software) became interested in spreading the system. Apple Mac was keen on doing everything itself. The result was a good, but pricey system, that could only compete with the multitude of Windows apps in some areas. It became the product for a small, niche market.

iPhone and iPad is on the same way. They're innovative, very good, but they're closed, and Apple bans everything that would risk its total control (see Adobe Flash, limited carrier and retail distribution, forcing of iTunes etc). The obvious enemy this time is Android, another open platform that mimics the innovative products of Apple, but with much more and cheaper (often free) content. People may want an iPhone, but will buy Android. Only time will tell, and Apple's market share will start to decline seriously. This won't be a problem until the market grows, but when everyone will have a smartphone, Apple will start to get hurt. The iPhone was the king of the hill for a year, but competitors showed clones only months after the iPad's first appearance. Apple is a good company, but could be more succesful business-wise. But it won't be, until Jobs fights with the world instead of cooperating with it."""	t5_2qh48	True

Can I just plug them in any USB port available if I want to charge them up? For example, my new car radio has a USB port. Is it safe to stick my mobiles in in order to charge it?

Sorry if it's a silly question, but I really don't want to run the risk of frying my precious little gadgets. It'd be very convenient to be able to re-charge them through long car journeys though.

Thanks!

Edit: 
since it's current that matters, I've checked and I have:

* HTC's charger (i.e. main -&gt; USB): output is 5 V 1A
* Car Radio: Max current from USB: 500mA (no info about voltage)

So I'm safe with my HTC: if it can take 1A, it'll take 500mA. The car radio can actually read iPods so it's safe there as well. And the Samsung's charger has an output of 0.7A so no problem there either.

However, I guess it might no be a good idea to try and charge my Samsung with the HTC's charger since I'm not sure the mobile can take 1A.

In any case it's much clearer now, thanks a lot!"	t5_2qh48	True

Pistolfist	4	1	0	"I've tried /r/raspberry_pi and /r/android and I can't seem to get a good enough debate going on this topic to come up with a clear solution for what I need, so I thought I'd give a more general subreddit like this a try.

Basically, I will spec it out a little bit first:

**Mandatory requirements:**

1.  Be able to watch Netflix
2. Be able to watch flash videos in a browser where no HTML 5 alternative is available (e.g jwplayer, rutube etc.), preferably using Firefox/Chromium not Chrome.
3. Work with my [wireless keyboard/mouse combi](http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplus/detail-page/B005DKZTMG_K400_FOB_US_lg.jpg)
4. Powerful enough for HD resolutions (preferably 1080p)
5. Be affordable (roughly £50/$80)

**Desirable requirements:**

1. Be able to play a local files from an external hard drive, mainly .avi and .mkv
2. Have a really nice unobtrusive interface
3. Be really small 
4. Be powered by USB
5. Work with VPN (really no biggie, I am looking at sorting out an OpenVPN router solution for the long term)

See with my current set up I am plugging my gigantic laptop into my  TV which is a less than ideal solution, for two reasons, firstly it's ugly and makes my front room look like crap, with the laptop being in the middle of the floor and the charger and HDMI cables running all over the place, I simply can't tolerate it much longer. Secondly, the laptop has a home, with a second monitor and speaker setup in another room, I would quite like it to live there and not have to worry about carrying it from room to room.

Unfortunately from what I already know and from what I have read about while looking for a solution it seems like there is no perfect solution. I have basically at this point only considered Raspberry Pi and Android sticks.

Raspberry Pi however doesn't seem to be a good solution for me because Linux vs. Netflix (although it is working on Ubuntu and other Debian babies, I doubt that a Pi could handle the Wine app that makes Netflix work on these distros) is the bane of my life and XBMC and other multimedia OS' don't seem to have a browser/work with Flash. Flash is another dick issue on Linux, the closest I've got to having it working fluidly on Linux is with Chrome, which for tin foil hat reasons I would rather avoid.

The Android stick seemed like a perfect solution, it seemed to nail all of my mandatory requirements on the head. With Firefox and the third party flash APK, the Netflix app etc. However from the small amount of discussion I managed to get from /r/Android on these, they seem to have a really inferior performance. Which I am absolutely gutted about.

Finally, I have considered the Chromecast as I have a Nexus 7 (although I live in the UK and they're not available here, I can wait). However, I would be tied into a third device, which may not always be charged on in my front room, I don't really want that, but if I could watch all the things I want to watch on it I would still consider, however (I'm not certain on this one) I believe there is only a few apps that can run on it and a flash enabled web browser certainly isn't one of them.

So I'm really lost here, is there a perfect solution for me or should I just wait for technology to advance and keep my OCD under wraps with my messy living room?"	t5_2qh48	True

The only problem is that the S3 takes a Micro Sim and my Charge is a regular Sim. So I figured that I could just go to a Verizon store to transfer the Sims data to a Micro and just pop it in my S3 right? Wrong, Verizon tells me that in order to activate the Micro Sim it has to be put inside a Verizon phone otherwise nothing will happen. I am not due for an upgrade till 2014 and I dont want to drop $600 for a new phone I already have and cutting the Sim card to be smaller wont work the chip is a different size .

Is it usually true that in such format/standard wars, that neither the most open nor most technologically superior standard wins out?

1357078561.0	15sgbl	Home theater - need suggestions for an HDMI adapter	Jibeker	5	2	4	"EDIT: Actually what I need is a splitter, not an adapter

Hey guys.

I'm looking for an HDMI adapter so that I can plug everything into my surround-sound box.

We have a pretty standard 5.1 surround sound home theater speaker system set up in our game room.  The problem is that it only has 2 inputs, but we have 4 things that are to be plugged in (XBox 360, PS3, Cable Box, Bluray player [I know PS3 can play it, but it's for my parents and they'd have absolutely no idea how to work a PS3]).

We got a (what I think is cheap) 4-in HDMI adapter, but it sucks.  It works only half the time and when it does the picture quality looks scaled down to 480p or lower.  I'm talking giant JPEG-like pixels.

So do you guys have any input on a good HDMI adapter so that we can get all these systems hooked up and running?"	t5_2qh48	True

I plan to hide the PC inside the entertainment center and use my phone to control the computer via VNC connection. I'm sure many are already doing this sort of thing, so any advice on logistics, sofware, or other tips are appreciated. 

Does anyone know of some nice PC software that can act as a media portal, giving me access to video files on my hard drive, and shortcuts to web pages. I'm hoping there is something like an apple TV type interface where I can have a big button for netflix, dvd's, youtube, hulu, and NBA League Pass.

Of course, I can do this all through typical windows navigation, or desktop shortcuts, but it's a little tricky on a small phone screen. So a media hub with big buttons would be ideal.

I recently changed my internet package, and was given a new wireless router, which is now in a new position. It used to be in the first floor, but is now on the second floor near the kitchen. Before the switch, I would get perfect reception everywhere in the house. But now, even though the wifi status bar will show full strength, the download speeds are dramatically reduced if I'm in certain parts of the house. In an upstairs bedroom, I'll be lucky to get 1mbps and will sometimes have no connection at all. The download speeds are supposed to be 15mbps, and when my laptop is near the router, the speeds are near 14. Also, in certain other parts of the house, I'll have wild differences in the download speed each time I run the test. The upload speeds don't seem to be affected much by this.

I'm buying a 15U 19"" rack cabinet for servers, routers and switches for my home. A bit overkill maybe, but I'm studying to become a network engineer or sysadmin, so it will help in that aspect. Also, my significant other prefers me to hide my tech to the best of my abilities, so a single rack is the best choice for us. To add to the storage for the computers my family uses, I now wish to buy one or two NAS-devices, and place them in that cabinet.

Now, I've been thinking about buying one or two devices from either [Synology](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822108056&amp;cm_re=synology_nas-_-22-108-056-_-Product) or [QNAP](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822107057&amp;cm_re=qnap_nas-_-22-107-057-_-Product).

The plan is to run RAID 5 over these, using 2TB disks, giving me a total of 6-12TB of storage. The question is if these devices are affordable, or if any other good rackmounted NAS-devices are available?

The Default Gateway and IPv4 are extremely similar.

Checking a site that [tells me what my IP is](http://www.whatismyip.com/faq/why-does-WIMI-show-a-different-ip-address-than-ipconfig.asp) says that my IP is 71.xx.xxx.xx

The [WhatIsMyIP](http://www.whatismyip.com/faq/how-to-determine-if-your-computer-is-being-assigned-the-external-ip-address.asp) site says that if the IPv4 showing up when I typed ipconfig in the command prompt and the IP showing up on their website are different, that it's good.

So am I correct in assuming that the connection is from my PC through the Router &amp; Internal IP, to the Comcast Center and External IP, and then to the Internet?

I am wondering if any of you can help me with an issue I'm having. As soon as I utilize more than 50% of my upload rate, my latency consistently, instantly jumps up to (normal latency+1000) milliseconds and does not go back down until upload rate usage falls to somewhere about 20-25%. There is no similar thing that happens for download rate. I have gone through two routers from two different manufacturers and the problem persists. I have contacted my ISP for help and they said they can't find the cause of the problem and will not help me.


I am guessing this is some really backwards-ass torrent throttling but the problem is this occurs regardless of what you're doing. If my mom wants to upload a photo to gmail while I'm playing WoW with nothing else running on any other computer, I will be lagging with 1000+ ms on WoW, no torrents involved.


I've been dealing with this issue ever since I got this ISP (Rogers Canada) and it has not went away.


My question is, are my suspicions that the ISP is to blame for some sort of intentional filtering/throttling valid? And is there any way to get around this? My only real alternative ISP is Bell Canada which is even shittier, I've had problems with the connection randomly disconnecting many times before with them when I lived in another area, among other problems.
