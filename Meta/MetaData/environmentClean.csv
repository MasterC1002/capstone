The Bureau of Land Management in Colorado is trying to lease 30,000 acres for fracking, including land completely surrounding the farm I live on! 	ambulanceblues	1582	396	159	"**UPDATE:** Thank you for all the comments and ideas. If anyone would like to help, here's what you can do:

1: Ask BLM to remove or defer all 22 parcels based upon outdated (22 yrs old) Resource Management Plan (RMP), which does not take into account Organic farming, agri-tourism, or recreation, nor does it take into account current mining/drilling practices.

2: Request the BLM hold a public hearing on these proposed leases (not required under outdated RMP). 

3: Ask for a 1-month extension of public comment period, due to the holidays.

4: Ask for an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), rather than an Environmental Assessment (not required under outdated RMP).

Keep in mind, a letter or a phone call is 10x more effective than an email. All contact info is [here.](http://www.blm.gov/co/st/en/BLM_Information/nepa/ufo/august_lease_sale.html)

To keep your comments relevant, focus on economics and family: you can tell them you plan your vacations around pristine air/water/land or that you would not buy food from a farm or take your kids to a farm near fracking wells. e.g. ""I like winery tours/we love cherry-picking/I like mountain biking on our vacations and we would not vacation in this area with oil and gas development.""

""Fracking is bad"" or ""Stop fracking"" comments won't be helpful.

Thanks again for everyone's interest in our area!

**---Original Post---**

The Bureau of Land Management in Colorado is attempting lease 30,000 acres of mostly *public land and wilderness for fracking in the North Fork Valley. The BLM somewhat suspiciously pushed this through over the holidays, and the public comment deadline is January 9. 

This land in question is smack dab in the middle of a vibrant organic farming community and will *potentially (-edited to take out sensationalism) affect the irrigation and drinking water of hundreds of farms and homes, not to mention the air/light/ground pollution, etc fracking brings.

I live on a beautiful organic farm in the area which relies on its pristine watershed, as do all the other farms along the entire valley. 

Any advice, angles on precedents, or other ideas? Anyone willing to help sign/spread the info?

[Details and BLM contact info on this page](http://www.blm.gov/co/st/en/BLM_Information/nepa/ufo/august_lease_sale.html)

1353248295.0	13ectf	A letter sent to the Reddit HQ today.	leoberto	1064	230	73	"Dear Lovely Reddit people [&lt;3]

I am writing to ask you if you can have r/environment as a default Reddit.

Big deal I know, that's like asking Facebook to go black for the day, or twitter to stop twooting.

I never cared about the environment before I found r/environment. Now I have sold my car, and travel to work on an electric bike powered by solar panels.

Changing r/environment to a default Reddit might have the power to get people sticking up for the environment like they did against SOPA and PIPA.


This is the message we need to get out there to save millions of lives. 

Oil is going to become more expensive as it runs out (they already have to go right down to the ocean floor to get it. and the oil they find on land is insanely expensive and polluting to get http://www.desmogblog.com/2012/11/15/former-clinton-and-bush-cabinet-members-now-oil-and-gas-lobbyists-expect-keystone-xl-greenlight)
All these hurricanes droughts and floods are caused by humans, which is proven time and time again. (http://www.nature.com/news/at-least-three-quarters-of-climate-change-is-man-made-1.9538)
Not getting everyone switching over to renewable energy in the next ten years will cause climate change to be irreversible (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/350.org)

This is scary stuff, but if average Joe like me can suddenly turn into a Net neutrality activist or an enivromentalist over night, surely we should do everything we can. everything we can.


""We can do it if we work together"" always sounded corny, but community websites like Reddit have changed my mind on that issue.

Quote taken from a BBC article, linked to in a post about 8 hrs ago (as yet, uncommented upon).

IMO there is not a more important (long-term) issue. I would like to think news like this grabs the attention of more people on here. I am really surprised it does not. Does r/environment and the issues arising from the posts undertaken really get the attention it deserves? I think it does not, and it saddens me.

Edit - Said Article [Record minimum for Arctic sea ice]( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-19652329), as suggested.

Edit 2 - As jayjaywalker3 has mentioned, perhaps it would be a good idea to, instead of just posting links to articles, link to articles within your commentary, insight or point of view. We need to engage, learn, share, eulogize and inform. Don't let people's voting deter you from asserting your view. We shouldn't particularly care what view on AGW people hold, as long as there is discourse and some kind of dialectic going on. We (r/environment) need to be a vehicle for change, not just outrage/despair."	t5_2qh1n	True

The parents of children she was inviting to her party said she is ""stupid"" for not wanting gifts, and now she's feeling quite bad. They actually said this in front of her... 3 DIFFERENT PARENTS said it.

I really want to restore her faith in fundraising for nature conservancy. You can donate online through her fundraising page, it is for a charity that uses half its profits to teach nature conservation in schools, and half goes to the Nature Conservancy. She chose to help conserve the Pine Marten. Her campaign page is here:

https://www.earthrangers.com/bbtw/profile137232#chain

Donations can be made by paypal or secure credit card. You can even donate as little as $5.

I know this might not be the best place to ask, but she thought of it herself. She asked if she could make her own Reddit account to fundraise, but I'd rather screen this through my own Reddit account, in her best interest.

Even if you don't want to donate, can you give us an upvote? If we get any donations at all, I'll take our picture tomorrow and post it here. I'd post one now, but it is past bedtime at our house :)

Respectfully.... Winter's Mom.

Just to be clear, today is not her actual birthday.  I did not mean to confuse, if that happened at all.  The incident where this happened was when she was mentioning to parents and kids after school that she wanted to get donations in lieu of gifts for her birthday, and they all shot her down in a rude way.

**EDIT #1:  Her donation page is at a shocking $265!! Thank you, Reddit! Here is a pic of me, Winter's proud Mom: http://imgur.com/Jrpyn  Yes, I've got cancer, I didn't think it added anything to the conversation, when everything is about me lately, and this thing was about her goals.  Besides, my hair is growing back now! She'll be up soon, and I'll add a picture of the proud smile you all will have given her for her birthday.  Huzzah!**

**EDIT #2:  Winter is up now, and I think her cheeks hurt from smiling.  We are still in a huge bit of shock over this whole thing, and she is reading messages and taking it all in.
I am losing track of unreplied-to messages, and I apologize if I am overlooking anyone's messages.  I am trying to soak in her joy atm!**

**EDIT #3: Here is a photo of my sleepy, joyful little munchkin: http://imgur.com/8iyRG
Sorry for the crappy picture quality, but our camera is a piece of junk! :)**

**EDIT #4: We are at 3x our goal now. STUNNING.  Seriously, when I posted this last night, I never thought it would even get seen.**

**Ok, so, crazy.  Winter's attempt at fundraising is everywhere now, including blogs, facebook, twitter, and more.  Her current total is $1825.  No matter why you donated, or how much, we are forever grateful.  She is so happy, thank you.**

**For anyone still checking for updates, I apologize, it has been crazy around here..
A link to our Huffington Post article here: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/21/winter-slade-raises-thousands_n_1443129.html  Thank you to everyone who made this a rousing success!!! I had no idea I was inciting my daughter's 15 minutes of fame so young.  LOL**"	t5_2qh1n	True
