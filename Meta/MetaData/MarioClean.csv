Anyway, it starts off in Super Mario 64, with Peach asking Mario to go to the grocery store. He agrees and gets in his kart (that's Royal Raceway), but falls in the water and ends up at Koopa Troopa Beach. He drives into the tunnel and gets hit by the train in Kalimari Desert. He chases it. After that it's mostly a fog in my mind, but I do remember Toad's Turnpike with Scatman playing, after which he somehow gets to Rainbow Road, where he complains about the neon Luigi, then he falls from there and back to Royal Raceway.

Does that sound familiar? Can you guys help me find it?"	t5_2qlqx	True

1370487874.0	1frmfp	Where the hell did Baby Bowser come from?	thingsthatareponies	26	10	24	"Look guys, it's pretty obvious that Baby Bowser didn't just pop into existence. Bowser is no Zeus; new lifeforms can't be born from his mind.
We need to consider the fact that Baby Bowser has another parent.

Thinking about it logically, there are only a couple possibilities:
A) Peach. Bowser spends a lot of time with Peach. Baby Bowser thinks Peach is his mommy, but Bowser Sr. shoots down the possibility. Kids are really perceptive, especially when it comes to Mario.

B) Yoshi
Bowser is a big turtle thing. Yoshi is a fruity dinosaur. They're both green. Baby Bowser shares some of these traits. He is green, like both of his alleged parents. He receives his turtleesque looks from his father, and his annoying nature from Yoshi. In addition, Baby Bowser's voice is also just as annoying as Yoshi's.

C) One of the million Koopas
Kings have kids with their subjects all the time. They don't want them, but it happens. Koopas serve King Bowser in the millions. Maybe one of them caught his attention?

Considering how attractive women are responded to in the Mushroom Kingdom, his overprotective boyfriend demeanor seems kinda justified.

Now, this particular Mario Party would be a bit of a salute to the Mario franchise. As such, I've been thinking of the idea of the boards to represent games from the Mario series. Not specific locations, which I've tried but can't seem to settle on specific locales from the games, but rather more of drawing from particular elements and images from certain games. At the moment, the main games I was thinking of drawing from for boards are Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 2, Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario World, Super Mario 64, Super Mario Sunshine and Super Mario Galaxy.

So, what board ideas or suggestions do you all have in mind regarding this?"	t5_2qlqx	True

Mario is just heroic, Luigi is the Same but a bit cowardly and has an underdog complex.  Wario is just greedy and selfish, Peach is a typical Disney Princess (minus singing).  Waluigi seems to have more personality like begin competitive, antagonistic, sociable in party events, sneaky etc.  This is just my opinion since I can't make a case other than observations and opinions.

I **love** this series.  The experience of playing each of the different Mario RPGs (including the Seven Stars) was top-notch.  I greatly enjoyed the gameplay, storytelling and the original characters for each title.  I have not played the newest game, and based on the reactions I have found most valuable so far, have no plans to do so.

I have two questions for my fellow redditors:

1) For those of you who have played Sticker Star, did you enjoy playing it on a handheld, or would you have preferred it had been on the Wii or Wii U?  For me personally, I found the previous installments to be home console-worthy, due to the overall experience of playing through the game, and was skeptical about the series transitioning to the 3DS.

2) Given the game's success (or lack thereof), do you think/wish future titles will remain on handhelds or return to home consoles where I *personally* feel they belong?"	t5_2qlqx	True

It's source is from a magazine called Big N. It's announcement was apparently on page 19 of the July/August 2000 issue. (There's apparently another game called ""Mario Adventure"" announced on the same page, but it's most likely [Virtual Boy Mario Land](http://www.mariowiki.com/VB_Mario_Land).) I can't seem to find a scan of it. If you happen to have this magazine, please help out many fans out there by scanning it and releasing it onto the Interent. That way, there will be official proof of the game. Also: the MarioWiki article about the game will be removed in 7 days if it stays as a stub. Please scan it so that the article can be rewritten. 
**Update: The scan has been posted on the MarioWiki and can be found [here](http://www.planetvb.com/content/articles/scans/big_n_ger/07-08_00/big_n_ger_07-08_00_2.jpg)!**

I'm a teacher who last year decided to make my class Mario-themed (why not, right?) I'll be keeping the theme this year, and in fact expanding upon it in several ways. In one major way I'm going to create three different versions of ""mastery quizzes"" based on each state standard. The reason for doing this is to give students the opportunity to re-test if they don't master the material the first time.

Other teachers who did this usually called their quizzes by names like ""Green/Yellow/Red"" to signify that, for example, you were taking your first stab at the quiz (green), or your second try (yellow), or, if necessary, a final attempt (red).

Any ideas for translating that into a Mario theme? I was thinking maybe 3UP, 2UP, 1UP, or maybe just three names of common Mario enemies (Goomba / Koopa / Piranha Plant). Wanted to see if you guys had any better ideas!!

Thanks."	t5_2qlqx	True

We are a gaming marathon group called Play 2 Raise.  On on April 26th, we will be hosting our third annual Mario Marathon for Child's Play Charity, live from our website (www.play2raise.net).  It should last well over 60 hours, depending on how many donations we receive.  You can find a lot more info on our website as to which games we are playing and some of our goals.

What we are looking for is some Mario paraphernalia you might have that you would be willing to donate to us to raffle off to a donor.  This may be a long shot, but having prizes to give away as incentive is a really awesome way to bring in the donations.

If you have any questions or concerns, you can contact me either here on Reddit or at our email: play2raise@gmail.com

You can read more about Child's Play Charity at http://www.childsplaycharity.org/about

I was wondering if anyone could share any songs they've come across.  As an example, I'll list two very popular songs:

1338782309.0	ujnqd	Is there a place where I can download all of the sound effects from Super Mario 64? (Preferably high quality.)	drivec	6	6	0	"I've been able to find some pretty decent rips of all of the music and some of the sound effects, but there are still a lot of sounds missing that I would like to have access to. I know there are ways to rip the audio from ROMs, but I have never been technically savvy with emulators, let alone digging deep into the game's code, so that's out of my reach.

I'm specifically looking for some of the short jingle sound effects like red coins and 1-up mushrooms. I honestly wouldn't think it would be this hard to find, but with the government's file sharing purge earlier this year, there are a handful of places to find only *some* of the sound effects from the game.

Any help will be appreciated. I'm still looking myself, so I'll report back if I find anything."	t5_2qlqx	True

Ichthus5	2	1	12	"Picture this: you are Toadganizer, essentially the mayor of the Mushroom Kingdom Castle and Toad Town. Your job is to build up Toad Town into a thriving economic power and tourism spot, and to bring in dignitaries from other kingdoms to meet with Princess Peach for fun and profit. Gameplay is split into two parts:

- Building: Turn Toad Town into a booming cultural center and make its civilians, as well as the Princess, as happy as can be, and also draw in new members and visitors from other lands (a city sim game)
- Defending: As is the norm with Mario games, Bowser will come around every once in a while to try to kidnap Peach, or even one of the dignitaries. Build up the town with defenses and train Toad soldiers to fight against Bowser's minions (a strategy/tower defense game)

If Peach or a dignitary should get captured, Mario can be sent out once to get her back; when he gets home, he crashes at his house and sleeps (I.E. has a recharge time before he can be used again). You can eventually upgrade your ways to protect Peach directly, such as also having Luigi in reserve, hiring Wario and Waluigi for a large sum to be personal bodyguards, or sending Bowser an invitation to a local sporting event, and if he loses, he has to go back home for a while.

[mildly theoretical post]	electromonkey222	1	1	0	"I used to think that before you got a mushroom, and became 'Big Mario', you were just weak for some reason, and that Mario sort of had different levels of 'super'; 


**1**) pre-mushroom(weakling/inadequate) - Mario: I'm pretty sure I used to think that a witch or something cursed Mario and made him small before every level.


**2**) mushroom(normal/strong)- Mario: I thought the mushroom was like a kind of 'heal' or something that made Mario back to normal, and for some reason you started out the level in a lower form. I don't know why but the ability to break blocks didn't really register to me as a big deal, and that the blocks were just easy to break. 


**3**)flower(super ball) - Mario: I had 'Super Mario Land' when I was a kid, which had the 'superball' that would collect coins and ricochet off of walls. It was the coolest version of the fireball imo.


**4**) Star(super) - Mario. I thought that at the point of Mario catching the star that he was in complete extacy; filled with joy so pure that nothing could make him feel otherwise, which was why enemies wouldn't be able to touch him, and the music also sort of seemed to fit that kind of reasoning.




But yeah, I didn't really think of the mushroom as a  'power-up', but rather a 'heal'.

I was 8 when I first played the game and at the time I tended to play games for a couple hours then leave. This was one of the first games I ever played all the way through and actually beat a lot of the sidequests in it. 

My best memory was when I finally beat the final boss.(spoiler-y, obviously) I would always get killed instantly since you would get dropped to 1 health with both Bros. But when I finally dodged her attacks long enough to heal, I destroyed her. I was able to kill her arms with a fully successful Bro attack, and her head took just two or three attacks. Then her heart opened up and I went to town. I had to kill the arms/head one more time, and on the second time she exposed her heart, she was dead. I felt amazing and that ending was really satisfying as an 8 year old.

Anyways, I recently found my copy of the game in my closet so I began another playthrough of the game. I just wanted to see if there's any other lovers of this game here on r/Mario. :D"	t5_2qlqx	True

Being a nintendo fan for all my life, I loved it! I bought the candy, and it turned out surprisingly good! But then I thought, why would those candies in such a cool mario container be all the way in the back of the store? Is nobody interested? Why isn't it at the checkout where all the other candies are?
