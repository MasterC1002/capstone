1366482406.0	1cr56k	Where To Start With Malware Analysis	ShaneHudson	43	11	16	"You probably get asked this a lot but I cannot find any post about it.

Basically, I have a background in web dev and computer science and feel that a more low level knowledge would be a good thing to learn. I'm probably not alone in needing a project, or something to actual apply the knowledge to, to learn.

I've always had an interest in security and while I have no intention of making a career out of it I would like to learn what I can. So could you please give me any links you like or any tips about where to start?

I presume I will need to run linux or something in a virtual machine to keep my own machine safe (currently using a mac), but I also have no idea where to get sample malware from to analyse?

So yeah, where to start?"	t5_2qrkp	True

They were all in the range of hundreds of thousands of files.  You don't do near TB transfers over the Internet.  This is normally done by shipping a hard drive.  Here's a few things to make everyone's life easier.

* Use USB 3... seriously, it saves everyone a *lot* of time copying files.

* Use a ruggedized external drive or an RDX cartridge.  We push RDX because of high reliability.  I've seen way too many external drives damaged in shipping.  Proper packing of the drive in the shipping box should be common sense.

* If you don't specifically agree on a different format use NTFS

*  PGP/GPG is pretty much the standard for encrypting files for transfer, but if you have near a TB to transfer save everyone a lot of time and just encrypt the drive or create a volume on the drive with Truecrypt and send the passphrase separately.  Both of these options are cross platform.  If you're using Truecrypt just use AES on the volume/drive not one of the triple options that slows things down.

* Exchange hash lists of your files.  You should have scripts ready to process these.  It's a waste of space and time to be sending files the other person already has.  If I get a hash list from someone we're sending files to I can set up a drive and run a script and it'll copy over all the files they don't have.

* If the files you are copying is less than the capacity of the drive don't bother compressing them into archives.  That just wastes time for little benefit.  If you need space it may make a difference with PE format files but if it's something like Android APKs they're already compressed so get another drive.

* If you're transferring files like the Windows PE format have some professional courtesy and run a script to change all the extensions to something like ex_ or the like so they can figure out what it is but won't infect a system by accidentally running it.  If it's something like an APK then it doesn't matter a much.  It's a good subject to bring up with the person you're making the transfer with.

* Including a return shipping label is very a good idea if drives are getting returned.

* Don't be a dick.  It's a small community and word gets around.  If you're professional, courteous, and easy to work with it'll go a long way.  You may need a job one day."	t5_2qrkp	True

1323008342.0	mzqtm	Education	OpenSecurityTraining	19	3	1	"If you're someone who already has a reasonable grasp of reverse engineering and malware analysis, I need your help. I need you to help train more people like yourself.

More likely than not you're ""self-taught"". Except, when you were teaching yourself you were probably actually relying in large part on the help of others. They freely posted zines, articles, and blog entries. They and answered questions in forums, email lists, and in person. Eventually, once you were confident enough to believe you would be right more often than wrong, you might have tried to pay it forward and share your knowledge back to others.

If so, you're the type of person who is needed. We need people who want to make an impact by more rapidly helping educate those who want to learn. We all know that things like certifications and most college curriculums set a fairly low bar for the expectation of what people should know for security. Certainly in the area of reverse engineering there is almost nothing. Paid training classes can be good, but the cost can prevent people from getting all the training they really need.

I believe what's needed are many more people teaching trainings in person, while encouraging their top students to eventually also become instructors. This brings down costs, provides a well-structured learning environment with instant feedback, and results in the education of many more people. If you're a person who already knows the material, becoming an instructor should be a snap. All you need are class materials, and a venue. Finding venues is up to the instructors, but now there is a place that lesson plans and class materials can be stored:

www.OpenSecurityTraining.info

This site is meant to act as a repository for class material that have been used in computer security classes at least a day long. The material must be released under an open license to allow the most possible instructors to utilize and adapt the material. It can then be used by new instructors as-is, or piecemeal to enhance or speed the creation of other classes. I didn't want to widely promote the site until we had enough seed content, and now I think we're there.

But we need more content, and more instructors. If you have classes on any security subject that you currently or have previously taught, and you would like others to use the material, please consider contributing it. And if you're one of the people who already knows a great deal of the material currently posted there, please start thinking about how you could take the material and start teaching others in person, at your job, at conferences, or elsewhere. For more about why you should contribute, and why you should teach, please read this page: www.OpenSecurityTraining.info/Why.html

Thanks

Get your favorite beverage(s), you're going to be busy for a while.


http://nsmwiki.org/Truman


http://nsmwiki.org/Truman_Installation_Notes



I installed Debian 7.0.1 , no desktop, no print server with 2 nics, as listed at http://nsmwiki.org/Truman_Installation_Notes#Truman_Server
on an old desktop.



Run the commands with sudo if you didn't make a root logon during the Debian installation, and get  
permission errors.



I backed up interfaces and set eth1 static like the notes
if you need debian info:
set static http://wiki.debian.org/NetworkConfiguration#Configuring_the_interface_manually



The installation list has been modified from the original RHEL5 in the notes, for Debian

install apache2 tftpd-hpa xinetd tcpdump isc-dhcp-server wireshark ngrep

I went to the ip my server had in a browser from another machine on the same subnet to make sure I got the default success screen that apache2 was running.





Next, make a backup of dhcpd.conf, then copy in dhcpd.conf from the truman notes.
comment out # ddns-update-style ad-hoc; or you'll get an error starting the server.



Once you make the ddquiet script, don't forget chmod +x ddquiet



I also installed usbmount to make moving files via a usb key easier in Debian.



In the Truman notes, when it says to change apache group permissions, use www-data for the group name instead.

If you don't see old ip in Edit /tftpboot/* files in the notes, make sure to scroll over. There's no word wrap. I used nano's replace command  Ctrl \ 


http://www.chrisnewland.com/find-and-replace-with-nano-47



When copying the cgi part , use /usr/lib/cgi-bin for the Debian install.

Edit /etc/default/tftpd-hpa, and 
change TFTP_DIRECTORY=""/srv/tftp"" to 
TFTP_DIRECTORY=""/tftpboot""



Reboot



On the client machine I had to replace wget with a new version to keep from getting app errors.
I had to install wget on the client from
http://cygwin.com/setup.exe
then copy c:\program files\GnuWin32\bin contents to c:\windows\system32



Back on the server,

I couldn't cd to orig,
had to sudo bash to get to cd orig
for ls -lR &gt; /forensics/orig/orig.ls and the other commands.



Also, on the laptop I used, I had to enable hard drive boot, in the boot order after network boot, or it wouldn't boot normal after pxe menu selection. 



As far as the usage, I swapped steps and copied the malware first, before  starting the faux servers. http://nsmwiki.org/Basic_Truman_Usage
After ending the faux servers with ctrl-c, I couldn't restart them all without errors unless I rebooted the server.



Besides the usage page, make sure to read http://nsmwiki.org/Truman_Overview



Also, even though I had accepted pstools ula as admin, I had to accept it again once for whatever user I was running under, which I think is by design. I went back in, accepting under each user, then resaved my base image.



For comparisons, I made user1 and user2 admin with no password, where user3 was limited.



Since there's no desktop environment on my debian box, I'll be copying the forensic files and reports and looking through them on another machine.



I'm looking forward to learning more about analysis, and I hope these notes are useful to someone else who doesn't have RHEL5.

I'm sure the principals are not dissimilar but I'd much prefer to start out on malware.

My school has a competition where we have to analyse a virtual machine image which has been infected with some malware. 

As part of the analysis we have to identify what the program does, and identify how the machine got infected.

Originally I was thinking I could use sysinternal tools to watch registry, processes, and netstat connections. This would tell me what it is doing.

Possibly run it through a sandbox like anubis to see its behaviour.

However, I am stumped how to identify the source of the infection. I would assume the original user acquired it whilst browsing a website. 

A lot of what I read talks about analysing  the actual code. How do I backtrack where it gets into the system? 

Will the (usally random) filename mentioned in the registry (autorun) appear in say firefox history logs. I believe these are in an sql database somewhere. Not familiar with browser forensics myself, let alone IE/chrome.

I am under the impression we were meant to use file level analysis, rather than run the image too.

Wondering if anyone can steer me in the right directions."	t5_2qrkp	True

""""""

A modern PC with windows has, even at first OS boot, several gigabytes of data. This data is a collection of bytes whose position in the data give them meaning. From the individual point of view, it is a repertory of all the byte combinations possible.

Assume a virus that, instead of carrying the code of the payload, uses the bytes from several known files and arranges them in a pre-arranged manner wich, once compiled, form the payload. The virus itself does not carry any encrypted code; only a serie of instructions that detail what file to fetch, what segments to use and how to put them together. By itself this looks only like a serie of innocent copying operations.

The complexity of the exploit possible to assemble is affected by these factors:

1. Size of the payload
2. Rarety of the payload's bytecode
3. Size of bytecode material
4. Diversity of bytecode material

#2 Can be considered a non issue, since one is certain to find every combination of bytes in a certainly very small amount of raw bytecode material. The 3rd and 4th factors can be mitigated by creativity and good planning that selects commonly present files as material. The size of the payload will lead to a direct increase in the size of the assembly instructions.

This virus is in fact a pure cellular automata that replicates by copying material from it's entourage. Akin to life and viruses, it does not carry a blueprint of itself but a ""cooking recipe"" whose result only becomes apparent as the process unfolds. Individual bytes from different, disparate files and programs become structured strings and code; much like living beings are a structured system of organic chemicals. AND THAT IS FUCKING RAD, DAWG

This is also akin to secret messaging technique where the people exchanging messages own copies of the same book as shared secret. The sender write his message then ""mines"" for each word in the book's pages, noting the page, line and position from the left. The numbers can be encrypted, but the system is as safe as the shared secret. This denies any ciphertext to those who would attempt to reconstruct the message.

Here is how such a theoretical virus would work in this manner. 

- Infected file is run, hidden process is initialized.
- Find N source files
- Create recipient for bytecode
- Begin loop for each file
    Read file bytecode
    Check DNA[counter] for X,Y
    Copy bytes X to X+Y
    Append copy to bytecode
    Advance counter
    Destroy last DNA instruction
- End loop upon end of DNA
- Compare bytecode hash to memorized hash
- Run bytecode if valid

Thus, in theory, for every byte to assemble one will require 2 integers to reference their position and size of segment. 

How it works work would be that first the evil genius would select a few large files that are present in as many computers as possible. He then uses an automated script to read the payload and find the position of every corresponding segment in the source files and assembles the ""DNA"" of the payload. 

So, what do you guys think?"	t5_2qrkp	True

1364158685.0	1axl0m	How do you build your malware collection?	Theory5	4	2	4	"Hi!

I recently found this subforum, and its awesome! I have been trying to find some sort of community that actually has active members that i can discuss malware with. I don't know what it is, but trying to find information beyond general malware analysis has been a nightmare. I have found many resources though, including the book ""practical Malware Analysis"" and ""Rootkits: Evasion and Detection in the...(etc, etc)..."".  Currently my boss has sprung for the SANS 610 Reverse-engineering Malware OnDemand course and I love it!

But a question has arose during my cultivation of malware analysis knowledge; my company is a medium-sized university and since we implemented OpenDNS on the staff side I haven't had half as much luck obtaining samples (student side is a nightmare when trying to gain permission from the owner to access their private system so I just ignore those).

I figure samples from wild malware will help me both in my job hunt (when I blog about my results) and aid me in protecting the business I currently work for. 

I was looking for High-Interaction Client Honeypots to automatically gather and possibly sort samples for me, but I haven't been able to find any programs that fit that description. I was toying with the idea of setting up some High Interaction Client Honeypots that seem to need a human for website interaction in the library labs, but I don't think that would work from a legal standpoint.

So how do you go about finding malware samples? Do you have some sort of automated system? Or is it mainly in malware exchanges (I saw someone's post talking about those)? Or you do it manually with a VM and just run through every link in your spam folder?

Thanks,
Theory"	t5_2qrkp	True

I mean that's why we got hit so bad by the capacitor plague. Most of the damage was done years ago but a group of machines, in this case 30 of them, all decided to pop their caps within a month of each other. All from the same company, 3/4 are the exact same model, and if nothing else they all have Intel inside. At least that's what the sticker says.
  
So today I was removing some ransomware from a newer workstation and I started thinking about the opportunities a black hat would have should he or she pwn a network full of PCs all with the exact same hardware. So I sought out a [tool](http://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?DwnldID=19763) to check out the hardware integrity of the box I was working on and I was not happy with the results. Specifically I was not happy with the [MSR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-specific_register) test results which showed a consistent pattern of offsetting between cpu_0 and cpu_1. Pwned? Buggy BIOS? Buggy Software? If nothing else I was hoping that anyone brave enough to take a look themselves would be willing to share some insight."	t5_2qrkp	True

So my friend got a new iPhone at a Verizon store and almost immediately it started acting odd. After dealing with several very unhelpful people, she finally found someone willing to go over it with a fine toothed comb and it turns out there was something called a spy stick on it. I did a little research and found that in order to install something like that, the phone would have had to be jailbroken. She's convinced that her spouse set the whole thing up to monitor her, whereas I maintain that it was most likely a credit card theft issue. I got her to check into her card, but I want to know if her theory holds any water at all. Do people really set things like that up with people's spouses or is my theory the more likely explanation? 

Also, I had her walk me through the entire explanation of what happened at the store but I won't lay it all out unless people care to/need to know more details. 

Also #2: If this is the wrong place to ask about this, I would highly appreciate being pointed in the correct direction.

I downloaded a software from cnet yesterday, and it installed a whole host of softwares that were not specified on installation.  I have managed to remove most of it, however no matter what I do, Chrome starts with the the sweetpacks search engine homepage.  I have adjusted my settings and extensions in Chrome to NOT do this, however it still does this.  Virus and Malware software is finding nothing and I am not sure how best to edit the registry.  Any help is appreciated.  Thanks.	t5_2qrkp	True
