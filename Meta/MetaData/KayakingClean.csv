1367289573.0	1ddvpx	PSA: Wear Your Life Vest! (Story Inside)	awesomeisluke	75	7	24	"A friend and I went out on the Susquehanna River last week. Normally we go down the creek near my house but we decided we wanted a change of scenery, so we went out on the river for the first time. We launched from an island about 10 miles upstream from where we planned to land.

Within about 500 feet, we approached a small dam. As we got closer, we realized that the drop was bigger than we expected (roughly 3 feet), so we decided to paddle back up a little bit so we would have time to stow our valuables (phone, wallet, keys) in the drybag which was secured to my buddy's kayak. After doing so, we were ready to go.

I went over first, and got a big splash into the boat, which wasn't a big deal. But what I didn't realize was that there was a powerful wash pulling me back into the dam.

Before I knew it, I was spun around and the water flowing into the dam poured on and into my boat, and I capsized. I was thrown right into the dam and got tumbled around in the wash until I could fight my way to the surface. Luckily, I was able to swim away once I came back up, grab my paddle and upside-down kayak and swim to my friend (who managed to escape with about half of his boat full of water).

He was able to pull us to a nearby island where we could drain the boats and rest for a few minutes. During the ordeal, I lost everything I had in my boat (lunch, shirt, sunglasses, flip-flops, and my favorite hat).

I found out after our trip that this very dam had claimed kayakers in the past. People often capsize and get caught in the wash but never make it out. After this I realized how lucky I was to survive, and I give all credit to my life vest. Had I not been wearing it, I believe it is probable that the outcome could have been much, much worse.

So tl;dr, WEAR YOU'RE FUCKING LIFE VEST! Especially in unfamiliar waters where obstacles can come out of nowhere. This may seem like a given to seasoned boaters, but I figure that if this story convinces at least one person to wear their vest, then it'll be worth it.

Please upvote this for visibility. This is a self post and therefore I don't get any karma for it."	t5_2rbz0	True

Myatariisbusted	26	4	14	"So, I've found myself working on endurance trips the last few weekends (longest so far has been 17ish miles, and definitely can do more even now if I plan my food better), and have been thinking of using this year to train for a circumnavigation of Manhattan, and do it next spring or summer.

The trip is ~28 mile run with amazing views and lots of serious boat traffic. I've done it on Circle Line tours (love that tour!) but love the idea of doing it in a kayak. I'm definitely not planning to do it solo, but currently unsure if I'll try to assemble a group or join a tour. The [Manhattan Kayak Company](http://manhattankayak.com/) runs this tour which may be the safest &amp; smartest choice. The only downside to doing it with them is the $225 cost, but having their expertise with the tricky waters involved is likely worth it.

If you were sitting on a basketball with your feet in the air, you would eventually lose your balance.  To keep yourself on the ball, you reach out with your hand and tap/slap the ground.  That's a brace.

What new paddlers often do, instead, is grab on to the ball.  But that can't help you because that's what's unstable. 

People will feel themselves tipping over and they'll let go of the paddle so that they can try to steady the boat with their free hand.  This makes you capsize. 

Picture yourself sitting on that ball, and reach out and touch the ground to keep yourself balanced.  Don't touch the ball."	t5_2rbz0	True

*2- Do not look up at the eagles flying around when you are entering a rapids.
*3- When you hit the rapids, paddle like crazy. Paddle, paddle, paddle.
*4- DO NOT leave the keys to the pick-up vehicle under the seat of the drop-off vehicle. (this leads to extreme marital disharmony)
*5- When you see your husband's yak flip over, and his head surfaces, and he is okay, it is the funniest thing in the world!"	t5_2rbz0	True

1298955235.0	fuu27	I came to realize...		21	2	5	"Today while running a local river, I was just screwing around at the falls section (class III/IV). I was boofing this large rock and throwing my kayak off to river left and avoiding a hole called ""Washing Machine"". I kept running back up river and running it with a new line each time. The river was low and the hole tends to be more sticky at lower levels. 

Eventually I see this lne that I think will make a good picture and story. So I line it up and just before the drop I realized that I was to far right...wait! What did I do? Oh shit I took door number 2 instead of number 1. I know what is coming. I am about to start surfing in the ""Washing Machine"".

As I sit in my kayak I look at the sky and start to surf for all I am worth. I had a good high brace and was doing alright...until I lose it and now I am getting window shaded over and over. I was in there for what seemed to be forever and then I started getting thrashed as the boat stands on the bow and then I fall face first into a large rock.

At this point I lost my paddle, attempted my hand roll to no avail and pulled my skirt. The boat had been the only thing keeping me anywhere near the surface of the water. Now the fun really begins. I busted my shins, my knuckles, my face and cracked the bill on my helmet as I swam for my life.

Finally I felt my feet press firmly against a rock and I pushed off of the bottom like I would in the pool floor when I was a kid in hopes of rocketing to the surface. It worked. I saw the sky, my boat, rocks and lots of water. That was a short lived victory. I was still firmly in the hole. Then I saw a throwbag... REACH! I just couldn't grab it and then I saw it get ripped away.

Now for more underwater swimming... This time I was sure I was in trouble. I had very little energy at this point as I had been trying to get out of the hole for what other paddlers said was ""about a minute and a half"". I seemed like hours. I remember getting hit repeatedly by my boat and then I felt a strong current pushing me and I really thought that it was done. I was sure I was going to die just as I surface some 5 yards downriver from the hole.

I quickly rode a bag out of the water and sat on the bank and watched some guys recover my boat and paddle. I sat there for a long time before saying anything.

I never thought that I was invincible. I just got cocky and forgot that even the local runs that seem easy now can really deal some hurt. It has been a long day."	t5_2rbz0	True

First time posting here, so I hope what I'm about to do isn't spam of any kind. I'm here with the best intentions, just let me know if I need to take this elsewhere!


Anyway, we're NW Documentary, film makers from Portland, Oregon. We're gearing up for a big project that is all about kayaking. This fall, we'll be heading down the Green and Colorado rivers to retrace the journey undertaken by some French adventurers back in the 30s. It's going to be an 8 - 10 week trip, and we need field support. 

We're looking for some experienced kayakers/campers to come along on the trip and basically guide us. At this point, we are just generally trying to spread the word as much as possible. So perhaps you all would know of some other good places to post this kind of position? If you are located in Portland, that's great. If you are located elsewhere, that's still great! Send me a pm if you are interested in applying, I'll get you some more details. Or if you know something cool about the rivers, filming + kayaking tips, those are also very helpful!

For some extra info:

[Here's our website](http://www.nwdocumentary.org)

[The trailer for the movie](http://vimeo.com/35988682) You should at least watch this, it's a pretty cool story!

Like I say, it looks like you guys have a good community going, so I apologize if this is a disruptive post. Thanks for reading!"	t5_2rbz0	True

1328585653.0	pe58p	Manatee Madness 	Bridizzle	16	0	4	"Did my first big outing on my kayak 2 weeks ago.  We went to Crystal River, Fl to see manatee and paddle the clear springs on a trip with Bill Jacksons Stores.  

First things first, if the only place you've seen manatee is the zoo or on tv, you dont get a true sense of scale.  There were several, really many, bigger than my 12' Pescadore.  THAT was something I didnt expect, especially when they surface right next to me!

[PICTURES](http://imgur.com/a/wOTyR)

[VIDEO](https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/7AI6nJrplur0tcIuY3XKcNMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink)

[Video 2](https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/qzP7aPKGez9d6iAJChRlTdMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink)

We had a nice 6 mile or so paddle from The Port hotel, to Hunter Springs, then to Three Sisters springs.  We got to Three Sisters aroung 12 and it was packed.  Amazing, but packed.  There were many manatee around, though most were on the bottom, or along the sides, out of the way of people.  The Park Service was even overhead in a manbasket warning swimmers and kayakers away form mothers and surfacing manatee.

After about an hour, we went to lunch and decided to go back after lunch.  We got back around 3:30 in the afternoon and almost had the entire spring to our 4 kayak flotilla!  Let me tell you it was amazing.  The manatee were SO much more active as it got to dusk.  They actively approached our kayaks, nibbling on deck lines hanging over, or just nudging the back.  My brother in law was in a camo tandem, and we were convinced they thought it was a long thin manatee.  They pushed him all over, and at one point he had 5 manatee surfaced all around him!

I had a few amazing encounters as well.  As we were leaving a calf and mother came over and looked right at me.  The calf nibbled at my hand and rolled over when I rubbed it's head.  The mother watched carefully and eventually decided to get in on the action and wanted a rub too.  It got to the point that I couldn't have left if I wanted to as I had manatee on all sides of me! I had to ship the paddle to keep from bumping manatee!  (I know you cannot reach out and touch them, but if your hand is in the water and they approach YOU, the wardens said it was cool.  You just cant initiate the contact.  Weird.)

It was amazing and I'd recommend that if you do paddle Crystal River to Three Sisters, go in the late afternoon!

Day two found us paddling out by the power plant and to shell island and the Indian mounds.  Taking off early form teh beach we were greeted by a pod of dolphin chasing fish.  The were circling and splashing, definitely feeding.  They came up and seemed to stare at us before they took off full speed THROUGH the pack so effortlessly.  Later, in the marshes, several otter swam by, as well as many other bird and fish.

Overall, I think we paddled a good 18+ miles in 2 days, went through a tube of Icy Hot but it was all worth it!

I cant wait for the next adventure!"	t5_2rbz0	True

DavidPx	14	2	8	"Being a stubbornly self-taught kayaker I've slowly been building up my repertoire of skills for the past year, and for the first time today I tried and succeeded at rolls!  It's just a C-to-C roll and only from my strong side, but it's a start.  Out of 20-odd rolls I only failed once when my blade angle was crap.  Otherwise I was pleasantly surprised at how natural it feels.  

What helped me the most was progressively feeling more comfortable putting my center of gravity over the sides of the boat.  I did lots of sculling braces following by sweeping high braces, always trying to get as close to the water as possible.  Finishing those strokes requires a hip snap &amp; push on the swept paddle so they're a good way to train your body to coordinate those two motions.  From there trying the roll was a bit of a leap of faith, but it worked.  As I've read elsewhere it's really just a high brace done from underwater.  I think the hardest part in an actual emergency situation will be making sure the paddle angle elevated enough.  "	t5_2rbz0	True

It was when I filled it up that I discovered a very slow leak coming from one of my new water containers.
     Obviously, this would pose as a huge problem if I had not tested it, and I count my lucky stars for testing the water canister. If I had not tested it, I would have probably lost a third of my water supply during the trip. Needless to say, I will now continue to test all my gear, new and old, before my trip.

Also, well, that's all I got. Keep your boats down and paddles up ladies and gentlemen. 

Edit - I thought of something else. 

Another sub that I frequent that may or may not have anything to do with firearm ownership has monthly contests. Is this something y'all would be interested in doing?

I have lots of water near my house and I would like to go on relaxing trips. Not looking to go through rapids or anything. Just paddle around the water and enjoying nature. 

Thing is, I don't know anything at all about the kayaks themselves. I would like something big enough for 6'2"" in me and maybe some room for storage (camera, water bottle, maybe a sammich). I have also seen people bring their dogs out, and I think I might enjoy that. Hes pretty small, about 35 pounds. 

So what kind of kayak should I look for, and if I get one used, what should I look out for? Will getting one big enough for me and my dog limit how gracefully it glides through the water?

If you need to know what the water is like, here is the coordinates for google maps (37.203013,-76.428334). Its usually pretty calm, but it opens up into a river that can get a little chop. Ive been on the water my whole life in boats, just never a kayak, so any advice is appreciated.

Mr_Ballyhoo	13	0	10	"This might not be a big deal for you guys but over the weekend we were up at my buddies cabin on lake Huron and they ran in to some boat trouble about a mile out(rope sucked up in to the impeller of jet boat).  Curious as to what was happening and seeing them with a single paddle coming in, I grabbed an extra kayak paddle, split it in half to throw in the haul and paddled my way out there to give them some extra help.  I handed off the paddle halves and proceeded to paddle around the boat to ""supervise.""  Well my one friend didn't like that I was dry and the smile i had on my face so he swam out to me and tipped my kayak over.  It's not a long kayak, pretty basic with single open cavity and hollow haul, maybe 8 feet long.

So after I tip over my friend swims back to the boat leaving me scrambling to grab the paddle before it drifts away and a capsized kayak.  Now I've always seen people enter a kayak from the side but the lake was rolling a bit and I knew it was gonna be hard to do it myself.  So instead of going from the side I decided to flip the kyak over, bring it around so my face was at the stern, holing on to the back looking down to the bow.  I was then able to reach my arms around to the cavity and then pull the kayak back under my stomach, stern submerged a bit bow pointing out of the water.  Once i was on top of the back half of the kayak i basically straddled myself forward to the cavity and then carefully brought my legs back in.  i did this within a single shot and in about a minute at most.  I was so pumped and proud of myself.  

I'm just curious, does this method have a name?  And is it generally used by kayakers as a method for self re-entry?  I like to think of it as a ladder method, since the kayak gets a little vertical when you first pull yourself back on it."	t5_2rbz0	True

I'm about to begin kayaking, something I haven't really done, but I have been canoeing and rafting down various rivers quite a lot. What are some helpful points to get started? What to buy, what to do, things to avoid, etc. I am also going to be getting a GoPro at some point and I'm not sure whether to mount in to my helmet, or to my bow. Any tidbits will be greatly appreciated. Also note that I live in East Tennessee. We have a few mild rivers and the Ocoee River. So I will be getting just a bit rough at times.	t5_2rbz0	True

1368415624.0	1e82ci	First impressions: Sea Eagle SE370 Inflatable Kayak	spongebue	15	3	9	"This isn't a complete review by any means, but for those considering something like this I thought it may be well-received.

Just some quick background, this came in the mail when I was out of town.  Thankfully, I was able to get my ""fix"" by going out in my hardshell boat at the in-laws, which I can't really store at my apartment due to transportation and storage issues.  I'm far from a seasoned kayaker, but I love going out for an hour or so on a calm lake to explore a bit.  Also, my hardshell is a 10' off-brand cheap boat.  I bought it for $250 new, to give you a perspective on that.

Within 10 minutes of the apartment office opening after I got back, I was there to pick it up. First of all, this thing is pretty big and heavy, even deflated. The package with everything necessary aside from life jackets weighed in at just over 50 pounds, including a couple boxes for packaging. The canvas carrying case is reasonably durable, but I'm not sure if I'd be quick to check that on an airplane ""bare"" if I were to travel with it as I'd like to.  Thankfully, when I do fly I can check 70lb bags, so I can put it in a suitcase and still be good.

That said, it's still luggable for a bigger stronger guy like me (just a little awkward to carry).  If you can have 2 people working together, that may be a bit easier.  The carrying case does have a shoulder strap, but it's still quite a bit of weight for someone like my wife, for example.

Inflation wasn't too bad. The first time I did this, I plugged an electric pump I have into the wall outlet to take a look. I checked the label on the pump, and unfortunately that uses too much electricity for the inverter I have (converts your cigarette lighter to a regular outlet) and I don't think I'd feel comfortable putting that kind of load on my car anyway.

Here's what it looked like on the balcony of the apartment:
http://i.imgur.com/5mLFdX5.jpg

Nice and long, no problem at all getting 2 adults in there! Even an extra kid mixed in should be fine. However, since my wife is out of town and needs practice paddling anyway, I had to go solo. Deflated it, put it in its carrying case (like a sleeping bag, be sure to roll it up really tight) and brought it to the Aurora Reservoir in Aurora, CO. Here's a picture I took last week of the place, when it was super quiet:

http://i.imgur.com/1ESlxie.jpg

And inflated in the parking lot. The foot pump is surprisingly efficient. My leg was barely starting to get tired when it was all inflated. And I mean ""just starting to notice"" and it was gone 2 minutes later. I was surprised that this is slightly longer than my car, even if it is a compact!

http://i.imgur.com/7oJBa50.jpg

Once I got it in the water, it honestly took some getting used to. Partly just to push back from the beach, but also because it did feel a little slippery on the water. I think it might be better with 2 people in it, just because you're sinking in the water more and get better ""traction"" if you can call it that. It also felt a little slower than my plastic one, but that's to be expected. Especially when my arms may have been a little sore from a couple days ago. But that said, it wasn't bad at all. You know those inflatable rafts that come with paddles, even the more durable ones? Not at all like that. You can absolutely get a lot more control with this thing, and speed. Just don't expect it to work as well as a similarly-priced hardshell.  Really, getting started is the hardest part.

If I were to go back and reconsider my purchase, I *might* have opted for the 330 instead of the 370. The 330 is the same thing, just shorter, which would mean less weight and more sinking, which would have been handy. But since the wife wanted one that could go with 2 people (and I'm pretty tall, even if she isn't) I think I'm glad I got this one.

Those are the first things that come to mind.  If you have any questions, I'm obviously more than happy to answer!"	t5_2rbz0	True

However, I recently found out that inflatable kayaks don't look as shitty as they sound*. I'll be using it primarily for tours on flat, sweet water, but once I've got the hang of it again, I'll probably want to take it for a spin on the North Sea as well. 

Now, there are quite a lot of brands and types, with wildly differing prices. Of course, I'm not going to spend hundreds of bucks on a kayak that I haven't tried on, but before I drive to the other side of the country to the one kayak store that offers different choices of inflatables, I thought I'd ask the guys here about their opinions. 

Have you ever tried an inflatable kayak? How are they? Can you get the buggers back into their bag after you've taken them out? Do you need an engineer's degree to put them together? 

*) Yes, there are also foldable kayaks. However, they are about four times more expensive. If inflatables turn out to be totally shit, I'll save up for a foldable one, but for now I'm hoping inflatable will be good."	t5_2rbz0	True

So pretty much what I have been doing is going around to the different outdoor activity oriented subreddits and giving my little speech about state parks.

There is a subreddit for national parks, but there is not one for state parks. Most of us, unless we live near one, probably can not always make it to a national park to do our activities. But one thing we all have in common is that we all likely spend a lot of time in state parks! And that is great because many of them are very beautiful!

But if you don't live in the area you might have no idea this awesome place even exists, so lets share our stories, photos, videos, and experiences in our local state parks!

In a kayak you get to view areas of the park that other people might not even get to see (and from a different perspective). That's one of the reasons I am very excited to be getting my own kayak really soon. So I would love to have you guys and girls join us over at /r/stateparks to share your videos, photos, and stories!

What I want to happen is for there to be a large directory of stories and content about other people's experiences in their local state parks, but I can only post about the ones near me (North Florida)! 

So please help me expand the subreddit! The more it expands the more people will be interested and will add even more content for you to enjoy, so post stuff!

If you want to post your content to /r/kayaking, then simply cross post it to /r/stateparks you are more than welcome to! If you add a little blurb about your experience at the park, or the park in general, in the comments section after you cross post that would be even better.

Thanks for hearing me out! Hope to see some of you there!

For the last couple months I've been getting really into the idea of taking a kayak-camping trip once it gets warmer again. I can't afford an 800 dollar kayak.  I'm thinking maybe in the neighborhood of $300 to $350, but I'm wondering if something like the [Future Beach Fusion 10](http://www.dickssportinggoods.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3986120&amp;cp=4406646.4413993.4417832.4417969) would be a good purchase.

So far all of these activities have been the sort of thing that don't require a high level of fitness. Sky diving, learning to fly glider planes, most recently scuba diving. Most of these things I do for a summer before moving on to something new. (after flying amongst rain clouds, rising above them to see the sunrise shining down on them over the French country side... I figure I'm not going to beat that so I'd rather have a new experience)

Kayaking has been on my wishlist for a while now. Both white water kayaking and tour kayaking. (thinking about looking into doing a trip around some of the Norwegian fjords)

Anyway, this is the first activity where I'm seriously wondering if I'm fit enough. I have no idea how the learning curve and physical side of kayaking is and I have no real upper body strength to speak of. Is kayaking mostly skill and endurance or will I regret trying to drag a boat through the water a 100 meters away from the dock?

I want to be the first guy to kayak from Florida to the Bahamas! I know what your saying, it's been done before by Verlen Kruger. But no when he crossed the Gulf Stream he tied his wife's canoe to his and had a sail so tecnically it's different than strait paddling. I currently paddle a sit on top but am saving up for an ocean kayak. My plan is to train extensively for a year and then paddle to the keys. I hope to by a two seater kayak and fill the front seat with food and water. From the Keys I will paddle as hard as I can knowing that the Gulf Stream will sent me north at 6knots . I know the gulf steam has a reputation of being extremely dangerous. I hope to reach grand Bahamas  in two to three days.  Totally understand that I sound like a lunatic on a suicidal dream but I keep thinking about it. I constantly look at google earth at work dreaming of the gulf steam. My hero Ed Gillet, the greatest kayaker known to man, had done an amazing feat and I hope to replicate it just a tiny bit. Thank you all for listening.

The fellow drowned 20 feet from shore when his dog leaped from his canoe and capsized him.  There was a PFD in the boat but he wasn't wearing it.

I paddle with some very safety conscious folk.  We all carry a bunch of first aid and rescue gear even for a lazy paddle on a local lake and no one would ever dream of going out without a PFD.   So of course the discussion there has become a very judgmental circle jerk.  

I'm assuming there are some folks on this subreddit that choose not to wear one so I was hoping to get some of the other side of the point of view.  So my questions are.

Why dont you wear a PFD when you're paddling?

Are there certain circumstances that you will wear it?

If you keep it with your boat but don't wear it have you ever practiced putting it on while your in the water with a capsized boat?

this is going to be a fun, drinking, screwing off run, and only those people that wish for this kind of adventure (floating alot more than paddling) need apply.

Please upvote for visibility, because, damn the storms, damn the water levels, me, my brother, and two good friends are going to make this happen.

He was trying to get an idea of what he should take and how much would fit into a Pungo 120. This is my full compliment of gear minus two small-med drybags worth of food. Thought I would share it with the group.
