Finally the line starts to move forward, and the crowd containing a cult-like fanbase starts to enter the theatre.  As my friend and I got close to the front door, a blond middle aged lady with a typical ""mom-look"", as well as two teenaged girls approached us.

""Can i ask you guys a favour?"", she hesitantly asked.
""Uh... Sure"", we responded, not knowing what to expect.  
""Is it ok if we just walk in with you guys?  My tickets are inside.""

As we had just waited for hours in a brutal line with die-hard fans, we were weary to let her join us.  A crowd of likely 200+ people were still behind us, many of which won't make it into the theatre due to capacity restrictions.

With this in mind, i said ""Well... Alright i guess"", in a somewhat sarcastic tone. ""If anyone asks, we're not a part of this"".

""Well, i'm Michaels mom"", she bluntly said, as the two daughters lurked behind.

""Oh...."" I said, as my friend and I quickly glanced at eachother questioning her statement. A few nervous laughs of pity were had, as we thought she was a little crazy, and attempting to joke with us.

Regardless we let her stand with us, as my friend and I felt like idiots as we explored the possibility that this could actually be Cera's mom.  Not a word was exchanged for the remaining duration of the wait.

Sure enough, as we walked through the front door, she was asked for her tickets.  She quietly told the man that her tickets were reserved, as they are ""Michael Cera's family"".

We saw them once later that night, sitting in the reserved section.

Samuel457	29	5	57	"I was just wondering about the dynamics of Scott Pilgrim fans. I think there's more fans of the books than the novels, but many of the fans of the movie haven't read all the books yet. It seems like there might be two different audiences, which is probably to be expected when you have the same story come out in two different forms of media. 

Personally, I saw the movie first and I enjoyed the movie more than the books, although since I was already a huge fan of the universe, learning more about each character from the novels was really exciting.

But I guess people in this subreddit are more likely to be hardcore fans of the series, so it would be difficult to make generalizations about the entire fanbase from here."	t5_2seyg	True

I was the bassist and backup singer but, every once in a while, I'd write a song. Around this time, I'd started feeling stuck in life, in my room all day, in my head a lot. It still happens sometimes. So I wrote a song that I wanted to sound big but was truly about a kid stuck in his room all day in bed-just stuck in his head. I would think about the first part of volume 6 where Scott keeps playing that handheld PSP-like thing, ignoring everyone, just trying to forget about everything that had happened. I went on the name the song ""The Glow"" after...well you know what. I'm proud of what I've done with this band while I was in it and especially this song (SP is one of my favorite comic series and one of my top favorite movies) so I thought I'd post it.

The first time I saw Scott Pilgrim was when the movie cane out. Seeing the trailer made it look like an awesome movie (which it was) so I had to see it. After I saw the movie,I only played the demo of the game,and that was it.Nothing else Scott Pilgrim afterwards. But then I started highschool, and found my school's library had some of the Scott Pilgrim books. So I read the first one and was instantly hooked. I read all the books (Volume 4 is my fav) and I got the game soon after. The game was also amazing. Then I found out about this Subreddit,and my jaw dropped. A whole Subreddit dedicated to Scott Pilgrim!? Sweet! All I can say is thank u Reddit, thank you.

1365569330.0	1c1lmc	Something I put on my blog awhile ago...	NathanielWeber	26	8	1	"First post! I just joined reddit about a month ago, and I found this nifty little subreddit. Anyway, I have here something I put on my blog awhile ago, that I thought you all might be interested in! It was well received, so I'll just copy/paste it here to see what you guys think!:)

Ok, so if you know me at all, you will know that I am a great lover of literature. And one of my favorite things about literature is getting to analyze characters, why they are the way they are, and we love them, or love to hate them. So I'm gonna do this thing, where I analyze some of my very favorite characters. And if you have one you want me to do, message me! If I know the character, I will do it. If I don't I will see if I can research him/her and then do it (no promises!). So I'm gonna start this new little experiment with one of my all time favorite characters. His name is Scott Pilgrim.

 

Let me start buy saying if you haven't read the comics or watched the movie, you are missing out. Seriously. There is a lot more to this franchise than cheesy fights and Michael Cera. I think the reason that people love Scott Pilgrim love so much is that, as far as characters go, Scott is so profoundly ORDINARY. Sure, he may be the ""best fighter in all the territories"" and the ""hero"" (definitely debatable) but here we've got a geeky, high-schooler dating, bass playing, jobless, boyfriend fighting 22 year-old who mooches off his friends, his roommates, and virtually anyone who comes into contact with him. And despite all of this, we LOVE him. Even when we shouldn't (gotta love those Canadians, eh?). But it's really not so unusual. Sure, we all love our Frodos, our Luke Skywalkers, our Supermans, but let's be honest. We've heard it all before. And nobody likes watching these near-flawless archetypes succeed in everything they do, always make the right decision, and get the girl with no sweat, not all the time. Occasionally, we need to see someone extraordinarily un-extraordinary. We gotta see someone not as good as us. It makes us feel better about ourselves. But we also relate to these characters more. We see the flaws in them that we see in ourselves. And we root for them. I know that I can personally say I relate to no character better than I relate to Mr. Pilgrim. He's not just an underdog, he's a character who learns that he is truly quite a dick, and not only conquers his flaws, but is finally able to come to terms with himself, and accept himself as the perfectly imperfect human he really is. The moment in the comics where his cathartic experience reveals to him that he is not so unlike his nemesis Gideon and unlocks the Power of Understanding is a perfect moment that epitomizes this. Such a great, captivating line. ""Gideon... I think I understand you man. And now I have to kill you."" *sigh* You gotta love his determination. This moment was altered in the movie, but to good effect. After dying in his initial battle with Gideon and coming back with his extra life, he learns that the person he should've been fighting for the whole time was not Ramona, the girl of his dreams, but himself, thus unlocking the Power of Self-Respect. By the end of the comics/movie, we see a character who deserves not his girlfriend, his friends, or quite frankly, anything, and grows into a man who deserves it all, but not by first accepting that he cannot love others until he first loves and accepts himself.

 

Which is another great thing about Scott. For those of you who don't know the story, the plot is that our slacking Canadian desperado, who falls madly in love with Ramona Flowers, the hip American delivery girl, must first defeat the League of Evil Exes, all sworn to prevent Ramona from ever finding love again. Here we have two characters who despite their imperfections, find romance. And I think that message is quite a refreshing one. Love can be found for everyone. It's not just for the fairy tale prince and princess. Even the average Joes, they flawed and sometimes that downright crappy people can find it. But for Scott, this won't come until Ramona's Seven Evil Exes have been defeated. I think that behind the video-game boss like fights is a pretty classic piece of symbolism. With each evil ex, Scott is coming to terms with one of his many flaws. Mathew Patel, the first evil ex, symbolizes Scott's simple knack of being, quite frankly, pathetic. Scott is certainly that at times, and after defeating this evil ex he begins to take a bit more responsibility. Lucas Lee symbolizes Scott's insecurity about his geekiness. Scott frequently feels that he doesn't deserve Ramona (and he is sometimes right) because he isn't rich, cool, or tough. But defeating the second ex, he learns to accept that he is what he is, and that is a nerd, and it's ok to love that about himself, and others must learn to love it too. Todd Ingram represents Scott's fear of being replaced. When the rival to Sex Ba-Bomb (Scott's band), The Clash at Demonhead comes into town, Scott discovers his ex, Envy Adams, has a new cool vegan boyfriend, who dresses a bit like Scott and plays the bass just like him (oooh I love symbolism). Seeing how quickly he was replaced by his ex begins to undermine all he has worked for, and he must defeat Todd to realize that he is the one and only, the original, and that he could never be replaced. Roxie Ritcher, Ramona's fourth ex, from her ""sexy phase"", is the embodiment of the envy that Scott feels, as well as he feelings of being, as he puts it, ""a pussy"". He feels ashamed of being beaten by a girl (Scott can be occasionally misogynistic), and wants nothing more than to prove to Ramona that he loves her, will fight for her, and that that means fighting anyone, even a girl, if he has to. It is here in the comics that he can finally say he loves Ramona and earns the Power of Love (it's very tender, I assure you). Then come the Katayanagi twins, Kyle and Ken. I'm not sure, but I think that the symbolism here is Scott's neglect. Just as the twins were forced to be shared between Ramona, Scott has been forgetting about his job, his friends, and his whole life outside of Ramona. I'm a little shaky on this part of my theory, so don't quote me. And then, of course, there is Gideon. I am sure that Gideon is the embodiment of every thing that Scott hates about himself, and that he also symbolizes Scott's pride. This is the final battle that Scott must face before he can understand others, including himself. He must defeat his pride and realize that, as Wreck-It Ralph would say, ""I'm bad. And that's good. I will never be good. And that's not bad. There's no one I'd rather be, than me"".

Quite a franchise I must say. Well, I hope my analysis of Scott was enjoyable for you, and I would LOVE feedback. And remember guys, ""Everything does not suck!"" Keep on keeping on!

It's gonna bomb in the theaters 2. people are going to get in on dvd and actually spread the word of how good it is. Basically, I felt it really had everything for cult film status. And now a theater I'm associated with is wanting to do cult film screenings, and I really feel like at some point we should throw SPVTW in there because I really feel it's developing a cult following, and it's always great to help usher in new cult films. So basically, I just searched for this subreddit to ask you guys what you think, has Scott Pilgrim developed (or is developing) a cult status, and financially worth the theater holding a screening of it. (side note: Screening would be audience participation, and stuff like costume contest, trivia, raffle prizes, things like that.)	t5_2seyg	True

My question is, did Scott beating NegaScott previously make him forget that he was kind of a jerk in his past relationships?

Intanjible	2	1	0	Suppose there were a storyline based on Ramona's personality aspects that were all somehow vying for the actual control of becoming her primary persona, where the traits would manifest themselves via her hair color. It could literally be a story about Ramona getting over herself. I'm not sure if there would be another evil ex storyline that would delve into Scott's possibly cadly ways, but perhaps one or more ladies from Scott's past could make their presence known. After all, according to the saga, he had only been broken up with once. I always thought that aspect of his character should have played into the narrative a little more somehow.	t5_2seyg	True

I read the comics myself a while before I knew they were doing the movie, but my friends that saw the movie first say it was easier to get into. Just wondering what people's views are.

I'm leaning towards movie only because my collection of the book is part physical and part digital but I will pick up the no digital books soon. Thanks to any and all who take time to voice their view point.

EDIT: Thanks for the advice, will show her the movie tonight and see how she likes it."	t5_2seyg	True
