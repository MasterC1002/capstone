Hey /r/boardgames, lots of new people joined the subreddit since our last big mod post, and as I write this we’re rapidly approaching 40K subscribers. 

This is a great community and we get lots of interesting posts, but one thing we notice as moderators is we often get trend or bandwagon posts.  What I mean by that is someone posts a particular type of post, and it does well, and then lots of other people see that they do well so make very similar posts.  And of course, doing well by getting upvoted does not necessarily mean conducive to great discussion which is what we try to focus on.  Some people will argue that if they are well upvoted, then they must be good posts, but not everyone agrees. As we grow, we get more people in here who are not familiar with the subreddit’s culture.  We seem to remove pictures of cats in game boxes or “playing” games fairly regularly. Elsewhere on reddit, cat pics are enjoyed and upvoted, but as our side bar says, /r/boardgames is:

&gt; The #1 reddit source for the news, information, and discussion about modern board games

and those posts rarely, if ever, generate good discussion, which is why we ultimately made a rule that disallows them.

Sometimes, removing a picture post requires judgement. Do we always get it right?  Probably not, but we do try to be consistent.  That said, we do typically invite users to post a self post with the picture, so that they can provide some context for the picture to help generate discussion. What we’ve found interesting is that this seldom happens, which suggests the user was more interested in some quick karma rather than providing a useful and meaningful conversation on the topic of board games. That leads us to our first policy discussion point.

There has been the suggestion in the past about limiting image posts in various ways. What do you think about image posts? Should we tighten up rules about types of images allowed? What specific types of image posts do you think are inappropriate for the sub and why?  Should we ban image/album posts altogether and require they be in a self post?  Please note, I’m not saying we should ban all links and make this a self-post-only sub, just opening up the discussion on banning all image/album posts. One of the benefits of doing this from the moderators point of view is that it makes removal of those posts completely objective.  One of the benefits of doing this from the subreddit’s point of view is that it encourages people to put the images in context, providing information about what the picture is about and why it was taken.

Another type of post that can suffer from bandwagonning is kickstarter/crowdfunding posts.  This has its own extra issue in that often the poster is someone who has some kind of interest in the project succeeding (other than being a backer), so it often feels spammy.  We’ve been trying an informal experiment recently (based on the general reddit dislike for reposts), that during a campaign we’ll only have one post promoting the kickstarter campaign. Those campaigns will also get mentions in the weekly kickstarter round up posts (thanks /u/notnotnoveltyaccount!) at key points in the campaign - one on the Sunday following the start of the campaign, and one on the Sunday prior to the campaign’s end date. This also doesn’t prevent people mentioning the kickstarter when it’s in the appropriate context of another post. Do members of /r/boardgames think this is a reasonable policy, and we should formalize it? If not, how do you think it should be handled?  This also doesn’t take into account games that are crowdfunded on other sites. /u/notnotnoveltyaccount’s kickstarter posts are wholly voluntary; Kickstarter is far and away the most popular site for crowdfunding board games, and I know it would be a lot of extra work for relatively little gain to try and do the same for other crowdfunding sites. Should we implement essentially the same policy (one main post per game) and encourage additional discussion in the kickstarter round up posts?  Other suggestions?

One regular type of post we get are WSIG (what should I get?) posts. Posts that are asking for game suggestions should be tagged [WSIG] so that users that don’t enjoy this type of content can filter them out using [Reddit Enhancement Suite (RES)](http://redditenhancementsuite.com).  As our sub has grown, we’ve seen a growing number of WSIG posts that are improperly tagged.  While this isn’t a big deal, we would appreciate it if members could kindly inform users making these posts of the tag so that they can use it in the future.  It would also probably be very helpful to direct them to the sidebar when doing so as a lot of useful information they might have missed is located there, including an explanation of the WSIG tag.  Also, remember that we have a WSIG section in our [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/wsig) that we can direct users to when they ask for common game suggestions.  While not all of the sections are fully fleshed out a lot of them are complete or mostly complete and can be helpful to point people to.  We do now have a template in the wiki that seems to get regular use, and a lot of people are encouraging its use. Do you like the way WSIG threads are handled at the moment? Are there any things you’d like to see change?

One of the great things about the community is that it’s clear that members care about the quality of posts here.  One of the manifestations of this is that people click on the **report** button on posts and comments they think are inappropriate in some way.  This brings the post or comment to the moderators’ attention, by putting it in the mod queue. Sometimes the reason is pretty obvious. But, not always. The mod queue doesn’t tell us why the post or comment got reported, and it also doesn’t tell us who reported it, so we can’t ask.  So, if you’re reporting a post, please send us a mod mail (there’s a link to “message the moderators” just about the box with the list of moderators in, in the sidebar), linking to the post or comment, and explaining why you think there’s a problem with it.

Lastly, as we approach 40K, we are considering expanding the moderation team.  We’d like to accept nominations from people, but for the sake of everyone concerned, we’d like to keep nominations private. This is not a popularity contest.  So, we’ve set up a google form for you to [submit nominations](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10mSHu_g60lpqRq46Gku22us2PYYDAJ0FUEYxaTr3iTA/viewform) on - that will save our inboxes and the modmail inbox, and keep all the relevant information together for us to look over and consider. We would like you to nominate users who you think make great contributions to the /r/boardgames community, and we’d like you to tell us why you are nominating them. Please provide links to their great content if possible.

Thanks for taking the time to read this.

1342151180.0	whc5s	r/Boardgames.  Here's a story I need you to read!	TexJester	438	65	171	"So something happened today at my local game store that I need to tell you about, as it's rather interesting and been on my mind.  I was hanging out at the store, with a few games out, in between games with my buddies, when this stranger walked up to me and struck up a conversation.  

He said he noticed that I had some cool looking board games that he didn't really recognize or know much about, and was interested in hearing more about them and what my opinions were.  He told me he was pretty new to the hobby, and was getting the urge to try something new.  I of course was excited to help him out, I love talking about board games(obviously), and I knew that my experience could be a great resource to the kid.  So I asked him what he has played and liked and what his past experiences were.  He said he hadn't played much yet, but he and his friends really liked some aspects of ""Munchkin"", but was looking for something a new and different, just not too wildly different so it would be an easy transition.  

Now if you know me, you know I fucking hate Munchkin, it's such a shitty game in my opinion.  I lost all respect for this kid immediately.  I couldn't help but laugh in his face.  ""Munchkin!  You have to be kidding me.  I can't believe you like that piece of crap.  Maybe this hobby isn't for you kid, that game is much simpler and less strategic than what I usually play.  I doubt you're on my level"", I told him.  

He was obviously a bit taken back, he had assumed a regular at the game store would understand, and started to explain why he and his friends actually enjoyed Munchkin, and that there were some things it did right.  This made my friend Marshall jump in.  Marshall hates Munchkin even more than me.  Marshall told him to piss off, and listed all the things that made Munchkin shallow and lucky, and that the strategy was simple and almost non-existant.  The kid saw our point, but was pretty offended, and reluctantly asked if we could still recommend a game for him.  We didn't, that kid didn't deserve it.  

That story is 100% true and I keep thinking about it.  So my question to you all is:  ""Was I too harsh?  I guess I could have been nicer, but a person who enjoys games so shallow and different than what I like probably wouldn't have enjoyed the games I play anyway, so it shouldn't matter right?""

Well, the story was almost 100% true.  This happened today, but it wasn't me in the game store.  It was you. And it was here.  

[The Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/wgd0r/i_love_yugioh_but_due_to_lack_of_other_duelists/)

Right now, many of the comments have been edited, and the nicer comments have risen to the top, and appears helpful now, but for most of the day, the thread was almost virtually without any suggestions, and most of the posts were just bashing Yugioh and putting him down.  Also people felt it necessary to downvote all his comments, the ones defending the game, and the ones responding to other's insults of the game.  Also people were upvoting all the plain ""yugioh sucks"" posts.  

The top post right now on the Reddit Front Page is about Reddiquette: [Link](http://blog.reddit.com/2012/07/on-reddiquette.html).  From this article comes a quote this subreddit needs to be reminded of: ""On reddit, “being respectful” involves doing things such as upvoting good content, downvoting irrelevant content (but don’t downvote good discussions just because you disagree!)"". 

 I can't agree with this more. the upvote/downvote button doesn't mean ""I agree/disagree with your choice of game, or opinion, or viewpoint"".  Anything that encourages discussion, shows creativity, effort, original content, and shows quality, deserves upvotes, whether it coincides with your viewpoint or not.  The opposite is true of downvotes.  

I'm disappointed.  This isn't how the subreddit should treat those genuinely asking for advice.  Things devolved into a e-battle for both sides, and sure maybe some of the OP's comments became defensive, but I don't blame him.  

You're better than that.  

Since becoming a mod for this sub about 8 months ago, my main agenda has been to improve quality of content, and to make this sub more personalized to fit the wants and needs of all the users.  I am actively working to diverge our subreddit from what r/gaming has turned into, and it's quite a bit of work.  

Responses like the ones in the thread above bring us down a level.  How many of you started here by getting advice for you first games, or for expanding you collection into something you enjoy more?  R/boardgames is usually a great and friendly resource.  It's a place for discussion and interesting new finds and sharing our love for the hobby.  Let's keep it that way.

"	silentwolf07	536	187	146	"Not trying to be a jerk... Can we stop the COMC post? It seems to be taking over the sub reddit.

EDIT#1:
Let me be clear that the COMC like the one currently at the top of the subreddit  is worthy of a COMC(hundreds of games and a billiards table).  However, like many have said we usually only get a image of a few games that almost EVERYONE own.  Yes, it's not that big of an issue but I did think it was worth bringing up a discussion on.  I apologize if this topic was brought up in the past as I guess I haven't been around long enough to see those. I also hate that my most popular comment/post has a negative vibe to it.... Not something I am proud of.  I truly enjoy this subreddit and don't intend to scare anyone that is new to the hobby away. I go out of my way in real life to introduce people to the hobby and would hate to cause people to shy away from boardgames.  

Note: I browse reddit via my phone with alien blue so RES doesn't work :(

EDIT#2:

I had given away a copy of Battlestar Galactica unplayed, mostly because my group thought that working knowledge of the show was needed to play. After trying to get it to the table for well over a year, I gave it to a friend at a local convention on the condition that he give it a good home where it would get played.

Now that my regular group has broadened their horizons a bit, someone suggested that we play BSG, because of course that's how it would work out. I can't afford another copy right now.

The submitter of that post, /u/ThatNiceMan, thought that our group should get our inner Cylon out and offered to send me a copy of the game for free. I'm here to say that OP delivered - I got [this](http://i.imgur.com/n3N21ou) in the mail this weekend. We'll be busting this out this weekend, So say we all.

I just wanted to say that I absolutely love this community. I may not post as much as dictionary_hat_rack (and even if I did, I'm sure my questions wouldn't be as thought provoking) but I still make a beeline here every day to see what everyone's talking about. I love reading everyone's thoughts on the latest games and yes, I enjoy the COMC posts, if only to see what other people have stuffed on their shelves. That someone would simply send out a copy of an awesome game to some guy on the internets is pretty swell in my book.

Again, a heartfelt thanks to ThatNiceMan for... well, for being such a nice guy.

I decided to check with local library to see if maybe I could work something out with them were they would advertise and provide a room.

I went up to the first Librarian I saw and said, ""Excuse me, I was hoping I might talk with someone in regards to occupying a room."" 

She proceeded to ask, ""Sure, what for?"". 

All I managed to get out was, ""Well, Im an avid board gamer, and I was hoping to possibly start a club or...""

She quickly interrupted me. ""I have a budget for clubs I'll lose if I dont use. Get me a summary of what you want to do. I'll provide the room, refreshments, any of these games your talking about, just give me a list and I'll pay for it.""

Short story shorter, within a few moments I became the moderator of an official community board game night, scheduled twice a month. I wont spend a dime, someone else is buying the games and food I recommend, and I will actually get paid for running the event.

When a game of mine grows stale, I try my best to infuse it with new life by handing it off to someone who will enjoy it. 

People should definitely keep and expand their arsenal every now and then, trying new things- I, for instance, recently discovered Cosmic Encounter and I don't think I'll ever want to part with it. A friend keeps his old Risk for sentimental reasons. However, when buying too much stuff and not using it seems to be a staple of geek culture (Board games, Steam), and it strikes me as weird that this is perfectly acceptable behaviour amongst people who otherwise consider themselves very logical and intelligent.

The practice isn't harmful, but the psychological culture around it is suspicious. Does anyone else feel similarly?"	t5_2qmjp	True

We've got the game won - all the monsters are defeated except one that is past our walls and destroying towers.  He doesn't have enough hit points to make us lose, but can still blow up another two towers.

It's my daughters turn and she has the ""push them back"" card, which will make the monster an easy target for the next player.  She knows she's got a lot of points, but also knows the next players is close.  

So, my daughter declines to play the push em back card and instead trades it to the next player - so there is no more damage and the next player can't kill the monster.

My daughter ends up winning by one point - would have come in 2nd if not for that play.  Needless to say, I was very proud."	t5_2qmjp	True

However, having lots of separate posts about the events that people in this subreddit are excited about isn't really that helpful, because any given post has a very limited interested audience here, because only people in your geographical locale can go.  

With that in mind, please don't post your events as a separate post in this subreddit, but instead add it as a comment here. You might also like to make posts in your local geographic subreddit.

I suggest doing it as a self post so that you can include some information about what International TableTop Day is, perhaps provide a link to the [TableTop Day YouTube playlist](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4F80C7D2DC8D9B6C) as well as to your own event.  This provides context for your event.  You might also include other people's events in your area too (after all, the goal is to bring people into the boardgaming hobby in general, right?).

That's what I did for /r/StLouis so feel free to use [my post there](http://www.reddit.com/r/StLouis/comments/1b4b5l/play_board_games_this_saturday_march_30_for/) as an example.

Also, we're all going to be excited about the games we play and how the events went.  ~~Please wait until Monday for /u/Epsilon_balls to post his weekly ""What did you play this week?"" thread~~  **Please** wait until /u/Epsilon_balls posts a bonus ""What did you play for International TableTop Day?"" thread on Sunday and add it as a comment there, so that we don't get a flood of After-TableTop-Day posts.

Thanks so much for your co-operation.

Usually, last class of the semester, I try and do something that doesn't involve learning material, but still emphasizes economic theory, even if its a small little tidbit. I've played the movie ""A Beautiful Mind"" a few times, others just played Game theory games, you get the picture.

I had gotten into board games this past winter, and Power Grid was one of the first buys after TTR and Settlers. I loved it, and automatically saw the potential to exemplify things like strategic behavior, profit maximization, oligopolies, scarcity, etc that comes up in first year Micro. So I brought it in, and we played a 6-team game for an hour and a half.

It was a blast. By the second turn, I could see gears turning in people's heads, and how everything had some application from the past 12 weeks of study. Everyone started playing really competitively. We only got to the start of Phase 2 by class end, but I think I had 4 requests on where I bought the game, so they could get a copy themselves. No one wanted to leave either, but sadly, time was of the essence to get to other duties for the day, so I had to pack it up and head off.

Might not be the normal type of post in here, but I'd thought I'd share how one of my favorite games helped me teach my course. Plus I may have made a few tabletop converts in the process. Overall successful day I think!

To try to help with what might get overwhelming to newbies, I started making this list. 

This isn't meant to be an exhaustive list of retailers or resources; It's only a list of abbreviations and acronyms that are mentioned often in /r/boardgames. 

Without further ado: 

**GENERAL ABBREVIATIONS AND ACRONYMS**

* AMA, AMAA : Ask Me Anything / Ask Me Almost Anything, a general Reddit term for when somebody is doing a question-and-answer / interview.
* AP : Action Points (or sometimes AP means Analysis Paralysis, see below), are points in games to determine how much action a player can do in a single turn.
* AP : Analysis Paralysis (or sometimes AP means Action Points, see above), when a player has so many choices in front of them that they are unable to make a decision in a reasonable amount of time. This can be frustrating to other gamers if they need to wait for you before taking their turn. Some are more prone than others, and will get AP even with few choices. Some games are just AP types of games! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis#Board_games
* CCG : Collectible Card Game / Customizable Card Game; Recently more commonly referred to as TCG. (See that entry, below). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectible_card_game
* COMC : Check Out My Collection, used when posting a picture of your personal board game collection. (per the sidebar)
* DAE : Another common one on Reddit, just means ""Does Anyone Else""... 
* DIY : Do It Yourself. Often related to P&amp;P games or game improvements that players choose to implement. See also: P&amp;P, pimping.
* FLGS / LGS : Friendly Local Game Shop / Store, a reference to a brick-and-mortar store. Usually for people looking for a place to play, or to simply buy locally and support their community.
* IP : Intellectual Property, of course not just in reference to board games. It ""is a legal concept which refers to creations of the mind for which exclusive rights are recognized"". http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property 
* JASE: Just Another Soulless Euro. Since ""Euro Games"" (see Misc / Themes section, below) tend to be all about mechanic, sometimes gamers are left feeling like these games are simply about optimization, or pushing cubes around, to perform the most logical or strategic move possible with your available resources. The game feels dry.
* LCG : Living Card Game: Similar to TCG, but when you buy expansion decks, they are not random. Android Netrunner is a popular recent example. Living Card Game and LCG are a registered trademarks of Fantasy Flight Games.
* MSRP : Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price, list price or recommended retail price (RRP) of a product is the price which the manufacturer recommends that the retailer sell the product. The intention was to help to standardise prices among locations. While some stores always sell at, or below, the suggested retail price, others do so only when items are on sale or closeout/clearance. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suggested_retail_price
* OGS / OLGS : Online Game Store, allowing you the convenience of buying games from your computer.
* PBF : Play By Forum, the game (usually a role-playing game) played on a discussion forum, in which players (from a few to several hundred) assume the roles of fictional characters or direct whole groups or structures (such as organizations, countries, communities).
* OOP : Out Of Print game (usually a depressing acronym for gamers to read!)
* PNP/P&amp;P : Print and Play. Games that are available as a free download online but which require printing and assemble. See also DIY.
* PSA : Public Service Announcement, usually to alert us to some board gaming news or sales.
* RAI : Rule As Intended (what thematically and mechanically makes sense in context).
* RAW : Rule As Written (what's actually there).
* RPG : Role Playing Game, where players take on the characters in the game they're playing, much like actors in an improv play.
* TCG : Trading Card Game, as made famous by Richard Garfield's Magic: The Gathering, allow you to buy expansion decks of random cards to try and make the best set of cards (aka Deck Building) for yourself as you play against others building their decks of cards. Similar to LCG, but in those, expansions you buy do not contain random cards.
* TIA : ""Thanks In Advance"", for when asking people a question. In general use on the Internet.
* TL;DR : ""Too Long, Didn't Read"", Another one found all over Reddit, this usually is at the end of a long posting and serves as a summary for people who don't want to read the full text.
* TOMT : Tip Of My Tongue, someone can't quite remember the name of a game and is looking for some help.
* VP : Victory points. A player's progress is often measured by an abstract quantity of victory points, which accumulate as the game develops. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics#Victory_points
* WIP : Work In Progress, meaning the game is still being worked on and what you see isn't quite final (in regards to game play, artwork, etc). Typically seen in Board Game Design posts, or from people who are modifying their games (like painting their miniatures).
* WSIG : What Should I Get, when people ask about what might compliment their collection. (also in the sidebar)
* 4X : 4X games are a genre of strategy games in which players control an empire and ""explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate"". http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4X

**COMPANIES AND RESOURCES**

* BGG : BoardGameGeek, the long time authority on all things boardgames. http://www.boardgamegeek.com - a lot of information, though the site's navigation takes a while to learn. 
* CMON : Cool Mini or Not, http://www.coolminiornot.com/, popular miniatures game publishers, which include the popular KS campaigns Zombicide and Sedition Wars.
* CSI : Cool Stuff Inc, http://www.coolstuffinc.com/, an online retailer with competitive prices, especially in the USA.
* D&amp;D/DND : Dungeons and Dragons
* FFG : Fantasy Flight Games, a big publisher in the board game business.
* GRC : Gamer's Roll Call, https://www.gamersrollcall.com - Full disclosure, this is my (jtown007) site! Designed to compliment BGG to provide advanced searches, and help organize your gaming sessions.
* G&amp;S : Geek and Sundry, http://geekandsundry.com/, an Internet community centered around web videos. Usually mentioned here in reference to Wil Wheaton's TableTop series.
* KS : Kickstarter, http://www.kickstarter.com, a crowd-funding site where some great boardgames come out from both independent and established publishers. 
* PAX : Penny Arcade Expo is a series of gaming festivals held in the USA (Seattle and Boston), and Australia (Melbourne).
* SU&amp;SD / SUSD : Shut Up and Sit Down, http://www.shutupshow.com/, a couple of guys doing some great journalism on boardgames.
* WotC : Wizards of the Coast, who now own the IP rights to D&amp;D, and who publish some board games.

**POPULAR BOARD GAME ABBREVIATIONS AND ACRONYMS**

* A:NR : Android: Netrunner 
* BSG : Battlestar Galactica
* CAH : Cards Against Humanity
* CoB : Castles of Burgundy
* GoT / AGOT: A Game of Thrones (usually in reference to the board game, but there are GoT card games too).
* GtR : Glory to Rome
* LNOE : Last Night On Earth
* LotR : Lord of the Rings. There are many games with this IP, so the posting will usually provide more context.
* LoW : Lords of Waterdeep
* M:tG : Magic: The Gathering
* RftG : Race for the Galaxy
* TI/TI3 : Twilight Imperium / 3rd Edition
* TtR : Ticket to Ride


**MISCELLANY (THEMES)**

These aren't abbreviations or acronyms, but they come up often enough that they're worthwhile to include here. Generally, boardgames here tend to be divided into one of these two categories:

* Euro-games (Sometimes called German-style games): These tend to be very strategic games where luck plays a very small role. The theme of the game is generally not too important, and in some cases can be ignored by players completely (causing some to refer to themes as ""tacked on""). As found in BGG's definition, ""The players' decision-making skills have a high significance in determining the outcome.""
* Thematic games (Sometimes called Ameritrash, or Experience games): These put heavy emphasis on the theme of the game, many times will include intricate miniatures, and often (though not always) have a significant element of luck (for example, via dice rolling). The overall play experience is very much driven by the theme.


**HAVE GOOD ETIQUETTE!**

As posted by Darth_Meatloaf, there's some good etiquette that would make a list like this unnecessary: 

&gt;It should also be noted that when abbreviations and acronyms are going to be used, it is generally good form to use the following format the first time you mention it:

&gt;Glory to Rome (GtR)

&gt;And then in subsequent mentions in that thread you can use just the abbreviation.

&gt;This tends to remove the confusion.
 

Not everyone knows these terms, and people might forget some of the obscure ones, so it really helps new people to spell it out the first time. Thanks, Darth!



**CONCLUSION**

If you're looking for more general info and not just abbreviations / acronyms, I found this glossary after I was almost done typing!

I'm sure there are more. Feel free to reply in the comments with others I've overlooked.

Hope this helps someone out there!

1351090418.0	120abl	"We are a community and you're welcome to join us (or, ""Why did my post just get downvoted?"")"	timotab	273	66	62	"I run a large gaming group here in St Louis. We have a number of published designers in our ranks, and several more unpublished designers. Every single one of them are regular members of the group and they play games, they teach games, and they give of their time to build the community. Because of that, when they do bring a prototype with them, people are willing to give them their own time in return. It also means that we know they are familiar with the state of current game design in the modern board game world, so we know that their prototype is likely to be of a reasonable quality.

We occasionally get people come along who have never been part of the group, saying ""hey, guys, you like to play games, so try out this game I made."" They've not made any time-investment into the group, so people are reluctant to give them any time back, playing a game of completely unknown quality rather then playing games that they already know or are recently published with a good reputation. If such people ask before turning up, I give them a heads up that that's likely the reaction they will get.

More than once, when people have decided to play a prototype from an unknown, it soon becomes clear that they have no idea of current board games. Several games from such people have been of the roll-and-move type, or the draw-a-random-card-and-do-what-it-says type. That only serves to make us even more wary of people coming in with games they've designed when we have no idea who they are.

But, as mentioned before, people who make the time and effort to be part of the community will almost always find people willing to help them out with their prototypes.

There's a similar thing in the community we call /r/boardgames. If someone who's regular, and has contributed to the community posts a link to their blog, then people aren't going to get upset. A well respected member of our group designs a game, and posts a link to the kickstarter of their project - chances are if it's a reasonable product, people will upvote it. 

However, if you're an independent product designer, and all we see are posts pushing your product, or asking how you can get your product out there better, people get resentful. If you're a board game blogger, and the only posts you make are links to your blog, even if it's relevant content, people don't like it.  If you have a kickstarter project, and all we see from you is links to your own product, or links to other people talking about your product, people get annoyed. 

If you're part of the community, and giving back to it, people are much more willing to help out when you ask for things of them. Members of /r/boardgames do not have a general disregard for indie designers, or kickstarter project, or gaming bloggers. They do, however, have a disregard for people who use this subreddit as a space only to advertise their wares, or have some kind of ""take, take, take"" attitude.

This problem isn't just in our subreddit, our community.  It's recognized across Reddit, which is why it's part of [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette), which says in part:

&gt; Please do
&gt;
&gt; * **Feel free to post links to your own content** (within reason). But if that's all you ever post, and it always seems to get voted down, take a good hard look in the mirror — you just might be a spammer. A widely-used rule-of-thumb is the 10:1 ratio, i.e. only 10% of your submissions should be your own content.

So, we're a great community. Don't just treat us as your own personal billboard. Get to know us. You might like us.

I know that just because a game isn't in the top 100 doesn't mean that it's not a good game, particularly as the number of games in existence continues to grow rapidly, but I thought it was an interesting milestone/occurrence. 

Can someone clarify a couple of things for me? 

Firstly, on [Settlers](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/13/the-settlers-of-catan)'s BGG page, it ranks it as 101 in board games, 108 in strategy games, and 15 in family games. I thought that ""strategy"" and ""family"" on BGG were subsets of the full board game list - that is, a game could be flagged as one or both of them. How is it possible, then, for Settlers to have a lower rank in strategy games than in all games? This implies that there are at least seven things that count as strategy games, but don't count as board games.

Secondly, I'm sure this has been beaten to death already, but how exactly does the BGG ranking system work? In this example, both Battle Line and Settlers have Geek Ratings of 7.323 and Avg Ratings of 7.45, but Settlers has 39857 reviews and Battle Line has 7920. I've looked up old threads, but I can't seem to find a definitive answer. Someone said something about Bayesian averaging, which would result in Settlers' rating being stronger, since it's from a much larger sample size. The only things I can think of that would account for Battle Line being on top of Settlers is either using the number of years from release being a tiebreaker (with newer games winning) or the system counting digits past what is displayed (e.g. Battle Line really has a Geek Rating of 7.3232 and Settlers has 7.3231)."	t5_2qmjp	True

Greetings /r/boardgames!

It was recently brought to the mods' attention that most gaming companies have a strict ""no card text"" policy when it comes to sharing images of rethemed games. The reason for this policy is if the card text is shared it makes it easy for people to copy the game by making their own version without ever buying the source game. Obviously that's bad for the publisher.

Now that we're aware of the issue, we need to enforce the intellectual property (IP) of publishers and remove any post that shows card text from rethemed games.

From this point forward, if you are posting rethemed images **you must crop out or blur the card text** if it is the same as in the published game. If there is any doubt, we will err on the side of caution and remove your post.

If you own the IP, you can absolutely show the card text should you choose to. Just make it clear that you own the IP.

We love seeing the rethemed posts and we hope they continue. The creativity shown by you all is amazing and very inspiring for the rest of us. But please be aware of this policy from this point forward."	t5_2qmjp	True

1361065476.0	18o3b4	BGG Top 100 sorted by weight class	Woetra	215	30	77	"[This thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/18nb6j/is_there_a_hierarchy_of_moderneuropean_games_to/) from earlier today discussing the relative weights of different games (according to boardgamegeek) inspired me to look up the top 100 by weight ""class"". I thought others might find the results useful, or at least interesting.

For those who don't know, the BGG ""weight"" for a game can be found in the game statistics box. The scale ranges from 1 (""light"") to 5 (""heavy"").

I have sorted the games into 1 point weight classes. The BGG rank of the game is in brackets.

[Edit: fixed some typos.]

Update: Some people are unfamiliar with the game weight system on board game geek. The system is even more fuzzy and subjective than the game ratings. Users are supposed to vote based on factors such as overall complexity, difficulty, and length of the game. The term is discussed[here](http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Weight#). BGG calls it is an ""ambiguous and overloaded term"" so these things should be taken with a grain of salt.

Despite its flaws, I find that the game weight can help me make decisions about what games to teach and buy so long as I compare the game I am considering with others of a similar type (ie genre). That is, I agree with wargamer [on the importance of making comparisons within genre](http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/18o3b4/bgg_top_100_sorted_by_weight_class/c8gnx35).

Update 2 (total makeover): Ok, I got the actual data from BGG and have reformatted it as a table entirely ordered by weight, and with each weight explicitly given. I hope this helps address some people's concerns with the ""classes"" and is just generally more useful due to the added precision.

1368064283.0	1dz2q2	How I teach board games	ohgeetee	231	44	56	"I end up teaching a ton of games to my game group, and have been the victim of being taught a game terribly on many occasion.  I feel like I have refined my method pretty decently, and it seems to work pretty well, so here it is.  A primary goal of mine while teaching a new game, especially to people new to board gaming, is to not have them hate the entire experience of learning a new game, or board gaming in general.  I feel we have a very niche hobby, and the more people that learn to enjoy it, the better.

**The Introduction**  
I start off every explanation with a simple sentence...  ""The goal of this game is to..."" and I fill it in with ""Win,"" ""Have Fun,"" or ""Win and Have Fun.""

I know we try to have fun at all games, but there are very clearly games where fun is the goal(I'm looking at you, Killer Bunnies), and others where winning is the goal.  I always keep in mind Dr. Knizia's quote: ""The goal is to win, but it is the goal that is important, not the winning.""

**The Goal**  
Next comes how you win...
""You win by having the most VP at the end of the game."" etc.

And when does the game end...
""The game ends after 4 rounds, when someone builds the 14th city,"" etc.

I do it this way so that every statement I make after this lets the players apply that to their goal.  Who cares if going to action space X lets me put pieces on the board, if I have no idea if that helps my end goal?

**The Glossary**  
I usually end up going through a glossary next, describing spaces, pieces, difference between turn, round, phase, etc.  Basically all of the verbs and nouns that you would make bold in a rule book.  This is self explanatory; it's so I may use those terms in my descriptions from here on out, as we will be using them all game.  In my glossary explanation, I point out iconography, like ""This is the universal symbol for VP...""

I think the above is the most important part of teaching a game, and what follows will flow logically.  There are many different types of games, and each lends itself to different methods of teaching the guts of the game.  I'll describe a few different scenarios below to get started.

**The Guts**  
For VP games, I almost always start off with describing the different ways to score VP.  In Race for the Galaxy, for instance, I would say something along these lines:
""You get VP by planets and developments placed, by winning goals, prestige, consuming(I'll explain this later), and end game points via these 6 cost developments.""

Then I'll move into actual gameplay, if worker placement, simply describing the different spots, some of which may have been covered in the VP area, but I'll give more detail this time around.  If it's a role selection, I'll describe the roles, and so on.

Some games it's best to just play a trial round after the glossary and VP descriptions, it is usually pretty obvious.

**Tips**  
Here are some general tips:

* Know the game you're teaching.  It helps a **ton** to have set up the game and worked your way through a couple of rounds before you try to teach someone else.
* Don't just jump right into ""OK, so this does that, and here is how you do this, Oh!, and this is important too..."" because the whole time people are thinking ""Why?"" even if they don't realize it.
* Pause every once in awhile to see if there are questions about the things you have gone over.
* Don't be shy about curtailing efforts to ""help"" you teach a game.  One of the more frustrating things when trying to learn a new game is having a sidekick interrupt with rules he thinks you'll miss, or worse, game play tips or tactics no one has enough information on to process yet.
* For really important things that people often overlook on their first play, reiterate it right before you start, and mention how it gets overlooked often while you're on that spot.  One that comes to mind immediately is someone trying to trade 3 non food goods for a castle spot in Caylus.  It happens so often, I always reiterate it, and give a castle wall test while I'm explaining(set up 3 piles of goods, have them point out which, if any, are legal castle builds, then ask why and why not).
* Remember that people learn in 3 primary ways: Reading, Listening, and Doing.  Most people are a combo of each, but heavy in one.  If someone wants to check out the rules while you teach, it will probably help them understand better.  Try to mix up the doing and talking to cover the other styles.

If you've had issues with teaching games and folks just not getting it, or if you get frustrated with how others teach games and want to start, I hope this helps you out.  A lot of this is probably second nature to many, but it is a real shame to see someone sour of a game because of how poorly it was taught.

Let me know if I have missed anything or if you have any tips of your own to share.  I dig seeing other people's styles."	t5_2qmjp	True

I need to pick up my kid from school now.  Thanks for some great questions.  I'll come back tomorrow and respond if any others get posted.  Cheers!
--- EDIT---

Here are some things you might want to ask about:


Entrepreneurship: we raised $700k to start a board game company.  Our biggest hits are Wits &amp; Wagers and Say Anything which are in Target, Toys-R-Us, Wal-Mart, Kohl's, Barnes &amp; Noble, etc.  We have 10 employees and finally moved out of my basement several months ago.


MBA sweatshop: how we hoodwinked our unemployed MBA classmates to assemble our games for pizza and beer.


Game Designer: I designed Wits &amp; Wagers and Say Anything.  These brands have sold over 700,000 copies in total, and are still increasing in sales.  Both of these games were featured by Wil Wheaton on TableTop.


Game Player: I was a pro Magic player for 15 years.  Losing to Jon Finkle in the finals in 97 is my biggest claim to fame, though  I was ranked between 4th and 8th in the world for sealed deck for several years.


Boat Captain: I captained an Alaskan salmon fishing boat for 12 seasons before jumping ship and starting North Star Games.  My determination to follow my dream came while the boat was sinking on a hella stormy night.


TedX: I gave a TedEx talk about how the Spiel des Jahres has changed the board game industry, and how we are on the brink of a cataclysmic industry change as card board moves to digital. 


Trouble Maker: I was a trouble maker as a kid.  In 8th grade, one of my game designs was banned from school because too many classmates were playing it during 1st period.

I felt the need to talk about this because a lot of people with the contrary opinion voice their worries and I feel like mine is often under-represented.

I enjoy looking at collection posts a lot and I feel that an encompassing thread for all of them is not the solution. I think that they are an interesting, visual way to get to know new games, especially if the OP is available to describe and recommend. 

I have bought two new games recently because I saw a collection with a lot of games I had and I asked the owner about them, enjoying them a lot so far.

I believe I am not in the minority when I say all of this because these posts are often upvoted and have plenty of positive comments.

Aggregating them all in a single post is much less productive because it is very difficult for interesting collections to get to the top if they are posted recently.

Plus, if you do not want to see them at all, you can just filter them out. As long as everyone understands the rules, you just need to exclude threads starting with [COMC]. To do that you need the add-on **Reddit Enhancement Suite**, which improves Reddit in many ways (should be available for most browsers).

Last November, I opened up a small Board Game/ Hobby store in Victor, NY.  Things have been going well (not fantastic) since than, but there is still plenty of room to grow. My question to you guys is do you know any good ways to spread the word about my store? Any types of suggestions of what i can do or should be doing would be awesome, but first let me tell you a little about my store.  I am going to do it in list for, since I am terrible at structuring things.

-The store is called ""The Game Gamut"".
- We are located on a busy Main St. where tons of cars go by us daily.
- Our building is an old historic landmark house with multiple rooms.  This allows for some very interesting setup for merchandise.
- We completely redid the place.  Added slat-wall, colored everything a very bright blue, and yellow.  Added glass shelves. some compartments. and so on.
-  Has a very inviting feel.  Most game stores don't feel like that.
- Since I have worked with kids a lot, I have a very outgoing personality. This allows for our store to be very family oriented.
-A very unique selection of games ranging from kids games to the more intense strategy games.  The inventory is constantly being added to as well.
- A large selection of demo games to be used at our game nights. as well as to help customers see games better.  I am constantly adding to that to.
-game nights offered Tuesday and Thursday to all ages.  We will probably be doing more soon.

That's really all I can think of at the moment.  If you have any questions, just ask! I will post a link to the website, and our Facebook!

1361620035.0	192rdl	"Should I use the term ""Ameritrash"" in my commercial board game writing?"	mrquinns	232	71	149	"HELLO!

Quinns here. I'm a part-time lurker, full time games writer and most recently a full time board game writer(!). I run Shut Up &amp; Sit Down, have a [monthly column on Kotaku](http://kotaku.com/5976648/the-5-or-so-board-games-to-get-excited-about-in-2013) and do [bi-weekly reviews for Eurogamer](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-02-20-skull-and-roses-review). I'll also do board game coverage for Wired, Rock Paper Shotgun, IGN, whoever's paying.

ANYWAY, in the [Reddit discussion of my last Kotaku column](http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/191crd/in_case_ameritrashers_needed_something_to_be/) it was pointed out that the term ""Ameritrash"", meaning American-style thematic games (that are obviously now designed all over the world), is actually pretty harmful to the hobby. Everyone who wants to get into boardgames has to learn, over however many days or weeks or years, that it's an affectionate term. Until then, they're going to assume there's more conflict and elitism in our much-loved hobby than there is.

It is a *useful* term, implying games that favour theme, dice, conflict, surprise and immediacy. But in addition to that elitism, the geographic implications that these games are only played or made in America are (today) mostly nonsense. So long as we keep using this word, it's only going to create confusion, conflict, and hurt feelings.

Why bother with all that?

So, I wanted to see if we could put our heads together to decide if you guys felt the same way, and if so, whether we could come up with a different term. And if we do *that*, I could start pushing it through all my board game writing.

I don't think we'll be able to start a revolution, or anything. At least, not so long as a site called Fortress Ameritrash is quite as popular as it is. But I feel like we could maybe do some good. Who knows? This stuff has to start somewhere.

Thoughts?

EDIT: Thanks so much, guys. I've read all 127 comments posted at the time of writing &amp; come to a decision.

I'm going to stop using the term Ameritrash, for the reasons posted above. Depending on the situation, I'll instead use American-style, pulp or thematic. Though I like American-style best because it reminds me of eggs for some reason and makes me hungry.

Along similar lines, I'm going to stop using the term ""Eurogame"". Not because it's offensive, but because it means non-boardgamers have one less thing to learn.

I first started SU&amp;SD to get more people into board gaming, and one of the things we agreed on was that we'd try and avoid any jargon whatsoever, even something as innocent as ""worker placement"". I think I'll not resort to labels &amp; earn my paycheck the hard way.

Thanks again. PEACE."	t5_2qmjp	True

1350488827.0	11muff	Hey /r/boardgames, let's talk about some stuff	nolemonplease	200	40	170	"Whew. It's been a while! We’ve gotten a *lot* of new subscribers in the past few months. I've figured it about time we take a look at our rules.

### COMCs

If you've been around a while, you'll know that this is the age old divide around here. I’m not going to get into the whole debate here. But I’ve heard quite a bit of complaining about COMCs from those who even like them, and then there was [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/10o1sy/not_trying_to_be_a_jerk_can_we_stop_the_comc_post/). 

Anyway. I’d like to propose a compromise: A semi-regular (weekly, every other week, monthly, whatever) selfpost for the community collections. Perhaps similar to how the “What did you play this weekend?” posts go. Here’s an example of what I’m talking about: [Hey r/boardgames, show us your collection](http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/nvk5q/hey_rboardgames_show_us_your_collection/)

### WSIGs

Don't forget that we have a collection of frequently asked WSIGs in the sidebar. I know that these are outdated, but please check these out before posting.  Also, *don't forget to use the search*. Quite a bit of the WSIGs, the ones without further detail, that get posted have already been exactly asked. 

### The Wiki

Speaking of, we're going to have a subreddit integrated wiki soon. This feature will allow us to have wiki pages under /r/boardgames/wiki. I plan to move the WSIG threads to the wiki as a better reference of what the community suggests. That way they are not longer outdated, and can be constantly updated and managed by the whole community. Some other sidebar threads will serve well under this format too, I think. I'll post more about this when the wiki gets released.

### Current Stuff We Do

* Meeple of the Week - Granted, we have been slacking on this a little bit lately. Do people like this feature?
* Bazaar - Not putting one up for October in lieu of the math trade, but does everyone still find the bazaar useful? Still want a mod to post something everything every month?
* Top 10 - I still update this at least once a month. I dropped the ball from weekly updates after I went on a two week vacation back in August. I plan to get back onto the weekly updates habit again. To contribute, join the guild on BGG and rate games, your scores will automatically be included in the next calculations (forever). [Here's how to do this if you don't know how](http://imgur.com/a/Xj7Io) (this link is in the sidebar, also).
* Banner - I'm not sure how many people know this, but please send me photos to use for the banner. I used to rotate this every this every two weeks, but I started to run out of good photos but my own. [Here's the banner archive](http://imgur.com/a/ESwrr), and [here's an album the banner originals](http://imgur.com/a/sOnGD), if you want to see what kind of photo composition makes a good banner.

Anything else? We’re absolutely open to ideas.

### Content, and How We Moderate

Something that the mods and I currently do is try to help orient to the subreddit to be ""discussion based"". Sometimes this means we moderate content that we feel is unproductive to this goal. 

Haul posts, what we call pictures of board game boxes that someone just bought, never seem to produce much discussion, other than ""I love this game."" And one haul posts seems to spawn five other haul posts, and then it turns into a problematic trend. We also tend to remove pictures of games in session, unless it is accompanied by a session report from the OP. Of course, not always the case; it's on a discretion basis. I generally dislike removing posts, and leaving it at the hands of the community voting. But sometimes I feel like the content of the subreddit with get disoriented if the picture submissions don't get removed, because they tend to be the submissions to get a couple hundred upvotes, rather than the interesting articles and the discussion threads.

But, we alone aren't the community. My question to you is, what do you want to see in /r/boardgames? Is there anything we are missing?

### New Moderator

One more thing... we’re adding a new moderator, **timotab**. When I've asked for thoughts on certain /r/boardgames happenings, he always provided nice, well thought-out feedback. timotab cares about this community a great deal, and I think he's going to do an excellent job. =)"	t5_2qmjp	True

**Edit** Wow I didn't expect this much great advice. After reading all the insightful comments.

* If the game I am playing isn't fun for everyone I am playing the wrong game.
* If the way I play doesn't make the game fun I am playing the game wrong.
* If my someone doesn't like the games we play or the way we play games, they are not my friend.

When I opened the game to check out all the gloriousness one of the packs (the copper pack) was misprinted and the center inlay was badly bent.

She then contacted Rio Grande Games and let them know about the problem.  They quickly replied (2 hours later) and told us they were sending us a new copper pack.  Soon after (1 week) we recieved the copper pack, the center inlay and the ""Governer"" a promo card from a celebration of the 10th anniversary of ""Puerto Rico"".

Rio Grande Games was so helpful, communicative and quick in dealing with this misprint.

###What this list is not:
A deeply analytical, statistical analysis of great games, taking into account both their strengths but weaknesses as well.

*These are must-play games because they are the most common games redditors enjoy to play or believe to be culturally significant (like watching a classic movie just so you get pop-culture references to it.)*

Points:

* A game needed only 6 votes to make the top 100. As it happened, #101 received just 5. 
* Ties, of which there were many, were split based on the games overall BGG rank (#86 to #100 all received 6 votes each and were ordered by rank).

* Out of 351 surveys, there were a total of 3044 votes. Naturally, that means not everyone filled out all 10 games (in fact, only about 80 percent did). Seven people only filled in one game. 90 percent filled in at least 5.
* 471 games appeared on this list, of which 215 of them received only *one vote*.
* People who named Monopoly as one of the best games also tended to name other classic games like Scrabble, Risk and Backgammon. 

Once again, a big thank you to everyone who filled out a survey and help me put this together. I love lists, and I appreciate the method behind this list. Now I have a point of citation when I say ""I can't believe people in /r/boardgames think Monopoly is one of the best games ever made."" ;)

I'll once again urge people to take some time to join the reddit guild and rank all your games on BGG. And possibly to update your rankings if you have done so before (See the top 10 list in the sidebar for more info)."	t5_2qmjp	True

The Resistance is a social deduction game in which players are either members of the Resistance or Spies.  They must work together to carry out missions against the Empire.  The goal of Resistance members is for these missions to pass, while the Spies want them to fail.  Each mission has a team leader that determines who will go on it and there will be 3 to 5 missions over the entirety of the game.  If 3 missions fail, Spies win.  If 3 missions pass, Resistance wins.

Big PC gamer, and recently got big into Magic:TG. My girlfriend and I recently got a place together and find ourselves bored more often than not.

When playing Magic, it always ends badly. Her deck is good but just not up-to-par (event deck vs. my ~$100 deck,) and it usually ends in frustration for one of us. I either can't *really* play, or she loses a lot. :c

I came to /r/boardgames looking for an awesome, anyone-can-win 2P game. I had it between Race for the Galaxy, and Small World. Having seen Small World on TableTop, I was already pretty sold. Maybe not the best 2P game, but it seemed fun.

I bought it a few days ago, and we've played at least every day (sometimes 2x or 3x,) and haven't tired yet. It truly lends itself to letting anyone win through its balance, and is just cartoony enough to not feel cutthroat.

So, fluff aside, I wanted to thank r/boardgames for selling me on that and being so helpful/informative. :) The number of boardgames available is daunting to noobies, and you really do help those of us unfamiliar. :D

TL;DR: You guys rock. Keep doin' what you do.

Android: Netrunner is an asymmetric two player card game that takes place in a futuristic cyberpunk world.  In Netrunner, one player takes on the role of the megacorporation that are looking to secure their network to earn credits and have the time to advance and score agendas.  The other player takes on the role of lone runners that are busy trying to hack the megacorporation’s network and spend their time and credits developing the programs to do so.  Netrunner is a Living Card Game (LCG) which means that each of the different booster packs released for the game contain the same cards, allowing all players to easily work with the same pool of cards when building decks.

Why I enjoy them:

* **Giving Back** After trolling this thread for a few months, digesting the information, diving into the deep well that is BGG.com and playing the games myself, I feel like I've learned enough about this hobby to provide some perspective/opinions to people who are new to this hobby.  While I can understand that seeing all of these similar posts can be annoying to some, I try to put myself in these new users shoes and think about how much I would have appreciated it if someone had helped me when I was new to the hobby.  Yes, the sidebar can answer most of those questions, but sometimes you just want some quick feedback from people who know what they're talking about

* **Learning** - If I don't find that I can contribute, I'm probably learning something, whether it's a new game I hadn't heard about before or a new perspective on a game I already know about.  And folks, everyone knows that learning is half the battle

* and for [COMC]s, it's always fun to see how another person has organized their collection, play a mini game where you try to identify every game in their collection and see if there's one you hadn't seen before, and also recommend new games based on a users collection, which goes back to contributing.

I haven't checked their list in a couple of days, but when I did, there were a LOT of great deals, some 70% off retail. You'd have to pay shipping and tax if in IL, but even with that, most of their games are cheaper than other retailers. I bought $200 worth myself. :)

Many people have probably posted their way before but I thought I would let people see mine*

**Your Job As Host**

As the host it is your job to make sure you have enough space and your place is clean. People do not want to come over and step over your beer bottles to sit in a small cramped room and try and play a board game. You may love your cat/dog but if he going to be jumping on people or knocking the table/jumping on the table, then lock your pet away.

**Who is Coming**

One of the most important things to think about for planning a successful board game night is “Who Is Coming”. This can change what games you can play as different people might like different games or if you have just convinced someone to try some modern games.

**Time**

How much time you have is also very important as well for what games you are going to play.  Only have 3 hours? Do not plan on playing Twilight Imperium.  I have found that there are 3 main time frames to aim for; The 3 Hour Jam, The 5 Hour Game Night, and The 8 Hour Game Day. These numbers might not be perfectly accurate but are great for adding up what you plan on playing. Game play time printed on boxes are usually not 100% accurate but when lined up with these times work out great unless this is the first time playing. In this case I usually multiply the game time by 1.33 to allow for explanation and learning time.

Practice explaining the rules (setup up the board and tell the thin are what this does and why you want to do that).  Have cheat sheets ready, Board Game Geek is a great place to go for cheat sheet and some games have write ups to shorten the rules to 1 page.

**What Games Are Planned**

Always have a plan of what you are going to play. If you go to someones place and sit there for 15 minutes saying “What game do you want to play”, “I dunno what do you want to play”. Now I did pick my words carefully, I said always have a PLAN but you don't need to stick to it like its the law.  If people are having fun playing 7 Wonders you don't need to stop after one game to move onto City of Horror. The only time I will break this rule is play a new game. I find often times my gaming groups are just as excited to try a new game I got as I am.

Key Notes:

* Are  new people coming then play a gateway game
* What are peoples favorite games who are coming
		Even if you don't like Munchkin sometimes it would be better to play it so others have more fun
* How much time you have.
* How much space do you have.
* How loud do you have to be.
		If my fiance is going to be in bed I won't plan for Cosmic Encounter, too many “Why the F*** are you allying with the Virus”

**Food**

My last major point is probably the hardest to get right.  Food, people are going to be touching cards and rule sheets.  Will they spill drinks or have greasy fingers? Do you ban eating at the table? You just spent $60 on this game? Here are a couple tricks I have learnt in the past few years of hosting gaming groups from my DnD days to Board game nights. Rule number 1 Beer Cozies. They are cheap and can even be customized.  If you are doing Pizza take a break from play, remind people to bring cash. Doing a short game night suggest people eat before coming but provide a small snack. Soft cookies and 2-bite brownies leave very little crumbs or smudges. However the best snack I have found is Veggies and Dip for $6 you can get a thing or precut assorted veggies and dip for 2 people. Have 4 people coming buy 2 and set them between people. The store bought veggies will usually not be as wet as if you did them yourself.

*2 major notes I have* 

* If you have 1 or 2 guys do a fast food run tip the driver. If you are buying a $7 meal give the driver a 10 and don't expect change. Splitting up 6 bills is annoying. On a budget can't spare a few bucks? Offer to be the driver.
* Host never buys his own beer either rotate where you are playing or rotate who is buying beer, but the host has taken the time to make sure the place is ready cleaned up got the table ready and often bought the games himself the man deserves a beer. Cheers.

**How to Spruce Up a Game Night**
When I wrote this up for my friend it was pages longer than this so I am bullet pointing this last part so people actually try to read this.

* Theme nights. Make a zombie theme night where you play Zombie Dice, then City of Horror and then Zombicide, or make a French themed night with The Castles of Burgundy and Carcassonne.
* Make a rule about cell phones. This didn't need to be on my list until recently but I had a horrible game night because one person was playing with their cell phone all night then would make a bad play and then complain about the game being unbalanced and his army sucking (he was Greyjoy in AgoT). This doesn't mean ban cell phones but make at least a rule about them.
* Don't be a rules Nazi, let people know when they break the rules but don't scold them for it.
* Making fun house rules can really liven up a game night. Make a house rule that you have to roll on the table, if it rolls off it becomes the worst number you could roll (for Summoner Wars this works great, for Catan this doesn't work at all).
* Now this point is my own opinion and so I know its right. Dice Towers Suck. I bought a dice tower once and thought it would be the best thing but when you roll the dice it feels like you got that roll when you use a dice tower people feel like the tower rolled it."	t5_2qmjp	True

Basically, every time the dice rolls anything other than a 7 and you do NOT get a resource, you get a welfare token. As soon as you have as many welfare tokens as you do visible Victory Points, you have to cash them in for a resource of your choice.

So far, the games have all been won by people who barely benefit from welfare. The difference is that the people getting fucked by the dice still get to scheme and feel like they're in the game.

Alright. Clearly we didn't so hot on the last post, so let's backtrack. No new rule, let's just talk about this.

Last week, we had a couple retheme posts. A *user*, not a publisher (at least he never claimed to be), contacted us with concerns about the rethemes posting the full card text. Before you complain about him contacting us instead of talking to the community about it, he said in his message, ""I'm wondering about the mods stance on this. I was going to make a post but figured I shouldn't if the mods actually condone those types of posts.""

Well, we didn't *condone* them, we just never thought about them. I remember seeing AEG's request on BGG about rethemes:

&gt; So there's been a lot of rethemes posted up here and i wanted to step in officially as the publisher and say...

&gt; They're pretty darn cool!

&gt; Now, that said, all we ask out of respect for the designer (and well, us) please don't post entire sets where it could be print and play. Show a few, maybe have some in piles or arranged where they can't all be read. Very much like most have been here.

&gt; Anyway, we are extremely thrilled everyone likes the game so much, and we're glad you enjoy it enough to have made a small hobby out of rethemeing it. Thanks!

And I thought, of course we shouldn't be allowing this. All of the other mods agreed. It just made sense. I realize it was only one user who contacted us, but again, *it made sense*. We honestly didn't expect the reaction that happened, we thought it would make sense to the rest of the community also. Didn't realize it would be controversial. Oh well.

So that's how the rule got drafted up, and well, you know the rest of the story. I didn't remember the details of AEG's post until the other thread, or else I might have been able to contribute to a better ""rule"".

Basically, what we're trying to do is prevent users from posting print-and-play ready games without the publisher's consent. Post a photo of the cards sprawled out on your table, instead of uploading each card image into an imgur album. Or, if you want to upload them straight on, then I guess hide the card text.

I don't want to talk about what's copyrightable, art and but not mechanics, whatever. Posting Love Letter in a different theme in printable files, *is* Love Letter, and I think that's disrespectful to the publisher. AEG does not post their card images up anywhere.

If you didn't see davefp's comment from the last discussion, read this: 

&gt; I think that intent is the most important thing here. Consider these two (imaginary) submissions:

&gt; 'Check out my Dr. Who re-theme of Love Letter', accompanied by a smartphone picture of the cards laid out on a table so that they look pretty.

&gt; vs.

&gt; 'Here's a print-ready pdf of my Dr. Who re-theme of Love Letter', along with said pdf.

&gt; The first post is showing off a custom creation. We love posts like these. It wouldn't be possible to create a copy of the game from the photo.

&gt; The second, on the other hand, is actively encouraging people to make their own and giving them the resources to do so.

&gt; If I could rewrite this rule, it would look something like this:

&gt; Do not post copyrighted material in a printable format. This includes counter sheets, re-themed components (e.g. cards) using the original text or images, and rule-books where applicable.

I pulled examples of Love Letter rethemes from our history:

What I think is totally fine:

A lot of people told us in the comments of the last thread that it wasn't our place as subreddit moderators to make a rule like this. It wasn't needed, it's reddit's place to deal with legal stuff. My response to that /r/boardgames is a boardgaming community. I think it's important for the community to keep a good relationship with publishers and designers. We need to exemplify ourselves. 

We're not here to just make rules when we think of something that sounds fun. The rules we do make are to allow us to point to something when we decide to remove a post. A lot of it I would love to be community controlled. In fact, memes rarely get posted because of the type of content we support. But we list it in the sidebar, because when we do remove something, we don't want to get a reply back with ""Well, you didn't say anywhere it says no memes!"" We left the Kickstarter posts in your control for the longest time, and only have a small rule about it now. It's all issue dependent though.

Anyway. But, let's talk about it. The rule from the previous thread is no more. I want to discuss with everyone how to handle the retheme posts.

This should be helpful to some of you thinking about maybe picking up the conversion set for your old game, or just wanting to see what all the new fancy stuff looks like before you pick it up.

Some stuff you can't really tell in the pictures is the new version cards have a slight matte finish on them but seem a nicer because of it, at least they'll hold up longer for those inevitable dozens play sessions.

1368082136.0	1dzl4s	I love board games. Here's why.	esspysee	173	37	55	"I'm 25 years old. I work a tidy, modest job and my weekends are my own. The fact I only have one or two little issues in my life that make me feel restless and/or irritated is not only a miracle, but speaks to a life well lived. One of these things that irritates me is that I don't play board games as much as I would like.

It speaks to something that lies deep in my psyche, definitely a relic of my upbringing, that I forever crave the company of people as we pore over a table top brimming with cards, bits &amp; pieces or differing combinations of the three. It speaks to a lack in video games, for years my entertainment of choice.

I bought Red Dead Redemption in June of 2012. I am still yet to remove it from it's case despite a craving to play it. I'll never get through Skyrim. Grand Theft Auto? You can GTFO with that noise. Don't get me wrong, video games are awesome. But... well... GAH.

I first bought Nintendo Monopoly. I'd never really been great at Monopoly, but I wanted the Nintendo one, because you're not my boss. And I do like Monopoly... But after a while I wanted something more controllable. So I bought the Game of Thrones board game. Which, for my first true foray into real nerdy Board Gaming was a real bad move. SO many bits! And Tokens! LAWD what a big box of stuff. Then we played it, consulting the labyrinthine tome of a rule book, mastering just how mean and bastard-like this game truly is.

I played the epic, epic, EPIC Twilight imperium, an 8-hour saga at three people which plays up to eight people. Even then... I was drained at the end of it. It taxed me, it vexed me, it made me really REALLY want to play light and easy to digest games.

It's not all military strategy though: I made my brothers fans of Ticket to Ride, I made my workmates howl with laughter at Cards Against Humanity, I've been a shady aristocrat in Lords of Waterdeep and oooooh! I played this game calld The Resistance, where you... Ahh, never mind. The main thing is OH GOD IT WAS AWESOME. King of Tokyo! 7 Wonders! I bought Say Anything in and my team at work had a great 40 minutes cracking each other up. Some then went and BOUGHT IT.

This is the ultimate testimony as to why I love this hobby. It's right there. On the table. Entirely in your reach. No controllers block you from the thing, you can touch it with your actual hands. That's subconsciously important. A hand of cards is way cooler than a controller. Don't believe me? Watch Casino Royale. That poker game, that's power. That's elegance. You know what's not cool? Being abused by some faceless douchebag in a game of Call of Duty. You know what's funny? A two hour roleplay of Fiasco, a game where you make a Cohen Brothers movie in the time it would take to watch one. You know what's not? That same faceless douchebag from that game of Call of Duty. Only somehow, he's playing WoW with you now.

My board game collection is taller than me if you were to stack them one on top of another. Both you and I, dear reader, know what I am. I'm a new inductee into this hobby who loves Netrunner like Jack Black loves Ronnie James Dio. Why? Here's why: I can't keep up a conversation. Stop looking at me like that. YES. I talk a lot. But I talk AT people, not TO them. When I try and converse, it feels like a lecture. There's no organic cause and effect. I feel it happen , too. But give me King of Tokyo, and suddenly I'm loose and easy, cracking wiser while you beat my ass.

OH! That's the other thing- I'm not EVEN THAT GOOD at playing games! I'm not competitive. I just like to play. I like rolling dice and seeing what happens. I like throwing down my hand in Ascension and using those cards to buy heroes and beat monsters. I adore PLAYING.

I have a dream. It happened once or twice. But in it, I'm playing the simple but effective ""Dungeon!"" with my 6-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter. He looks at his cards, brow furrowed and says, ""I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna fight the giant ooze thing."" And he says it like he's gonna free fall from an aeroplane. And he rolls the dice. THAT is a moment of pure joy and emotion. I felt it age 10 playing mouse trap, I felt it age 24 playing Game of Thrones. And you share it with other people. So, please make time to play with me. Let me show you something new, something cool.

Because I love you.

But we're not playing Risk. Or Monopoly.

Because I love you."	t5_2qmjp	True

Don't forget to add lots of details: what games you own, what you want to play, what a store specializes in, a link to its website, what games your group plays and when, what to bring, etc.

Here's a [tutorial](http://www.reddit.com/r/PipeTobacco/comments/vdm82/rpipetobacco_idea_along_the_lines_of_the_member/c53kvhj) that should help if you're not familiar with google maps.

**EDIT 1:** ~~I've started adding FLGS's from the [sidebar thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/t1n8o/growing_list_of_flgs_in_your_area/).~~

**EDIT 2:** 90% of the FLGS's from the FLGS sidebar thread have been added. I really only added the ones that had an address readily available in the comments, and after that only the ones that had a location on the map. So make sure you check you are for your shops, you may have to ad them manually.

**EDIT 3:** A few users have pointed out that our map has gotten so big that it's become paginated (in other words you guys are awesome)! I'm working on finding a solution to displaying all pins at once, but for now make sure you check each page in order to see all pins near you. The pages are located at the bottom of the scrolling sidebar on the left of the page. ***If you don't see your pin make sure you check other pages.***

**EDIT 4:** I've noticed that some pins appear to be jumping around. This might be an error with google maps or an issue with people unintentionally moving them, but periodically check back to make sure your pin is in the correct location.

**EDIT 5:** Thanks to /u/MusedFable for pointing out that boardgamegeek has a [similar function](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/map/user/search) that allows you to find gamers in your zip code."	t5_2qmjp	True

Thanks r/boardgames!	latenightnerd	162	26	36	"For Christmas I got a lot of amazon gift vouchers. I spent a lot of them on board games that I had never heard of before coming to this subreddit. I got Dominion, Settlers Of Catan, Munchkin, and BezzerWizzer. I've never been a board game enthusiast, but reading all of your positive posts makes me want to be. 

As I've got pneumonia at the moment, I've basically been on my back for three weeks. I feel horrible. It's a very slow healing process. I finally had my games arrive yesterday but I was too sick to play. Today I was feeling marginally better, so I asked my wife if we could learn Dominion. It was slow at first, but we eventually got the hang of it. I was getting so excited at one point that I went into a coughing fit.

So, now the game is over (my wife won 44-28), I blamed my illness on my bad gameplay, and I'm off to bed again.

My rule book certainly says this is NOT the case but after reading a post on here by someone who INSISTED it was allowed I did some digging. I found [this](http://www.mayfairgames.com/gamesupport/FAQ_Catan4e.htm) answer: 

&gt; Q: Are there any rules changes?
  
&gt; A: ""No"" is the short answer. We have cleaned some text up in the rules for Cities &amp; Knights, and we have changed a rule for The Settlers of Catan to match the new international standard. The changed rule affects the robber: ""The robber may now return to the desert even after moving out. **Thus, a player may choose to move the robber back to the desert rather than to an opponent's hex, if the player chooses to do so.""**

Also appears in the new rule book on page 5 at the very top of the right column, [here](http://www.catan.com/en/download/?SoC_rv_Rules_091907.pdf)

This blows my mind. I've been playing for YEARS with the ""desert is off limits"" rule. Not that I EVER see the benefit of doing such a crazy thing in-game, it still blows my mind that this is allowed.

We play a decently tight round of the family game, he picked up on the strategy quickly enough and gave me a run for my money with a heavy livestock and large pasture strategy. We both ended up with 4 family members and stone houses, but I pulled off a victory, 32-30.

Scott was a very nice fellow, and we had a great time together. Unfortunately, he's leaving town soon, so I probably won't see him again. Just one of those chance encounters that happens in life.

Moral of the story: If someone comes up to you in the laundromat and asks to play Agricola, say ""yes""."	t5_2qmjp	True

FFG has the ability to print the board tiles (Descent), print a beautiful rulebook (any FFG game), and mold the models (Descent again, but also Dust, Battlelore, etc.).

So if someone had only a US$150 budget for boardgames for the rest of their lives, what would you recommend? Not starter games for someone getting into the hobby, but the most replayable games because it will be the only ones they'll play for the rest of their lives.

1354743612.0	14cfw4	What are the best games that can be played with a standard deck of cards?	mattigus	135	16	142	"I went to my FLGS with a buddy of mine, and he played a demo of the tabletop miniature game ""Malifaux."" For those of you unfamiliar with it, it's a miniature combat game, but instead of using dice to resolve combat, a deck of cards is used. What blew my mind was that the deck of cards used in this game was just a standard deck of cards with two jokers. During attacks, each player flips a card on top of their deck and adds an attack or defense modifier. If the attack succeeds, another card is flipped, where a high value incurs more damage than a low card. Some characters get bonuses based on the suit of the card (in this demo's case, my friend pushed an opponent back because his attack card was a spade).

I was fascinated by how the designers of this game used a standard deck of cards to replace dice in a miniature game, while also adding a strong thematic element to it. It got me thinking: what other games utilize a standard deck of cards to create a deeper gameplay experience? Are there any good card games out there outside of Hearts and Gin Rummy that a lot of people don't know about that are underrated?"	t5_2qmjp	True

* **Game Mechanic:** Role Selection/Variable Phase Order

* **Number of Players:** 2-5 (best with 4)

In Puerto Rico, players are plantation owners trying to earn the most points by running their business more efficiently than everyone else.  Each turn, players will select one role from those still available to them on their turn.  It is with these roles they will be able to grow and store their crops, sell their crops or ship them back to Europe, use colonists, and develop San Juan.  Whoever has the most points in the end wins.

Nevertheless, it was found over time that LEGO boardgames was not withstanding the requirements of the LEGO Group for a sustainable and long-term business branch. It was therefore decided to adjust the product line at a global level. This means that there will be no more new products for 2013.

***
. It's one of my fav games and I have taught it many, many times. To not overwhelm people, I generally do something like this:

1) Have someone who hasn't played pick a color, block off that region. Give someone the money, ask them to be the banker and give everyone $50. 

2) Explain theme.

 3) Explain that there's a few phases a turn and we keep going through turns till someone has built 15/17 cities, and whoever POWERS the most on that turn wins (I try to say that line a few times, since it's easy to forget) 

4) Auctioning! I randomize start player at that point, and explain how we do it in first place-&gt;last place, what the power plants are and how you auction them, and can buy one a turn. 

5) Buy resources (only resources which your plants can use), up to 2x what your plant can use, from last place-&gt;first place

 6) Buy houses, only in the spot with a ""10"" in each city, only 1 player in each spot, explain connection costs. 

7) Turn in resources from your power plant to power the cities you have built (and you can only use each power plant once per turn, but you can save resources from turn to turn), and get paid money depending on how many you POWER. Not how many you have, how many you POWER. 

8) Explain how turn order changes (yes, I know technically it's the beginning of the next turn, but it flows better this way) and how restocking changes (and give someone sitting near the resources the rulebook and show him which column to use to restock). 

9) Say how we keep doing that until 2 times: 
when someone builds 7 cities, on the NEXT turn, we can then build in the ""15"" spots on each city (for $15 each instead of $10, and only where we have not already built) and then 15/17 cities, explaining the victory condition again.

THEN, I start the game. After starting.....

1) Whoever is first in turn order is usually making jokes about being screwed at some point along the way here, but when we're actually starting, I explain how we reorder once on the first turn after plants are bought, so if he buys the 3, he's GUARANTEED to be first for resources and first to pick a spot to build on that first turn, and possibly the second turn as well.

2) Resources usually play out quite easily.

3) Building, point out the cheap places to build and mention how people usually fight over them, so it's a balance of wanting to have cheap places to build vs taking a slightly more expensive place, but having no competition.

4) Powering, just watch to make sure everyone turns in the right amount of resources and asks for the right amount of money.

5) Unless someone brings it up before now, this is the first time where I mention how the most expensive plant goes under. It's important, but not important to know before the game starts. I then ask the guy who's restocking to restock (and make sure it looks right after he does), I handle reordering myself (it's the most confusing part), show anyone who is confused why he's in the spot he is, in the turn order, and say, ""OK, and now we keep doing those steps over and over.""

6) NOW is the time where I mention the limit of 3 plants. It doesn't matter on turn 1 (the highest plant which can drop in turn 1 is the 13, or 11 or others in that area on some maps, so EVERYTHING there powers 1-2 plants, and you just want the best you can get). On turn 2, there's times where the 20, 25, or 26 can drop down, and it matters to know just how important those are early on, and introduce the term, ""end-game plant"" and how you generally will want 3 plants to add up somewhere around 15/17 to win (since again, it's only who powers the most when someone builds 15/17 who wins....note that's the third PLANNED time I mention the game-ending condition). I also mention that you never again HAVE to buy a power plant and how it works if you pass, and warn people that the biggest mistake I see in the first game played is buying too many plants and having to keep throwing them away at this point.

Honestly, setup/explanation that way takes maybe 20 mins, and maybe 35 mins in, we've done turn 1 and I'm done explaining for the most part. Only the most dense people I've seen haven't gotten it after turn 1.

The only other things that I haven't mentioned at this point are obsolescence and what happens with the available plants when Step 2/3 hits (and I keep an eye on the game to make sure to let people know if it's important, before it happens), and then the money tie-breaker at the end, which I explain if I see it's close.

My version for novelty purposes:

Power Grid can be quite overwhelming to a player not familiar with many euro-like game mechanics.  And just as overwhelming trying to convey to a new player how much planning ahead they need to do to avoid getting left behind.

Hopefully the following guide may help moves things along for newer players.   *Keep in mind that there are quite a bit of resources online, written by people who have has much more experience than myself, so I recommend comparing and checking around for what you think will work for you!*

I suggest to explain it to at most 3 new players.  4-5 newcomers to Power Grid can be very messy if trying to explain all of them at once, or at least quite time consuming.

***

**Intro**

""In Power Grid we are all Mr. Burns, buying power planets, buying the materials for them, and juicing up houses that we build to get money.  With that money we will buy better plants, more resources, more houses, and light them up for more money, and so on.  We will play a practice game up until someone builds their 7th house.  Whoever lights the most of their houses on that final round will be the winner.  So pretty much everything you do before that won't give you points or anything.  Its all about racing to get ahead for the final round.""

***

**Components**

""Here is the map.  You will see there are seven cities in each of these colored regions.   

Can you point to any color section you want us to play in?  Any one at all.

Okay, now can you point to a section next to that?

&lt;repeat&gt;

Okay, that will be the area we will play the game in.  To avoid confusion, i'll dump all of this garbage and uranium in the areas we won't use.  Don't worry we gave all the people living there a couple of bucks for the inconvenience.  So ignore the areas we are not playing in.

Everyone grab a bunch of houses.  The color your pick has nothing to do with the color regions on the board.  

Put one of your houses on this 0 for houses.  That keeps track of the number of houses you built.  It will also help us determine turn order.  Speaking of which, I will put my house on the 1st turn order to show you how it works.  Now each of you put your houses on the rest of the turn order.  Don't worry it will re-arrange constantly.

Now we will lay out the power plants.  See plants 03 - 06?  Those are the power plants up for auction.  See plants 07-10?  That is the future market.  These will be up for auction later.  I am putting this nice clean 13 power plant on top of this deck of other power plants I'm shuffling.

Now can someone set up the resources?  It should look like this picture in the instruction book.  There is coal, oil, garbage, and everyone's favorite:  uranium, mostly used for the uranium pew 36 explosive space modulator &lt;end Marvin voice&gt;, but more mostly for some of these red power plants we'll see later.

Finally, everyone take 50 elektro.  Power plant owners have their own currency for some reason.""

***

**First Turn: Auction**

""Now I could sit here and explain all the steps, but we'll do a practice round and i'll suggest what to do, and after that we can start over or keep going.

Look on your little reference cards.  The first part is ""determine turn order"", that has to do with most houses, tied broken by largest plant, but we'll do that later.

Next is 'buy power plants'.  See where it says 'best begins?'  That means turn order is from first to last.  So I will go first, and don't worry, that definitely doesn't mean I am the best.

In this first round we MUST buy a power plant, otherwise it defeats the purpose of us playing the game.  So I will pick one of these four power planets.  i'll pick the 03 plant.   My opening bit will be at least this number.  So I will bid $3.

Now you have a choice, you can either pass, and buy another plant, or bid higher than me for it.  Do you want it?  We can all pass for now just to get things moving, but up to you.  I will explain how the plants work afterwards, and as I said we can start over.""

Since [this person] bought a power plant, she can't buy another one this turn.  Now let's see who is first on the turn order to bid on a plant now.  With that in mind, whoever is last can pick up a plant at its lowest cost since no one can bid against you!""

*Continue with auction*

""Remember how I said turn order is determined by most houses, ties broken by largest plant?  Well let's do that now.   We only do this post auction sorting for the first round, for the rest of the game from now on we will only sort turn order at the start of the round.""

***

**First Turn: Resources**

""Its time to buy some stuff for our plants.  See how your card says 'worst begins'?  That means whoever is in last place gets to buy first.""

For resource buying, try to have players do double capacity for coal/maybe oil, and maybe single capacity if anyone buys garbage.  Be sure to tell the players to save at least $10 for building houses.  

""I will explain how these resources will power houses when we get to everyone's favorite thing about playing games:  the bureaucracy!

***

**First Turn: Building**

""Its time to build!  on your card, it says again, 'worst begins'.  Since we are doing a practice game, only one house per city.   Once someone puts a house in a city, no one else can build there.  You can build past it of course, paying huge sums of money to do it most likely!""

""See this 10?  In our practice game we will just use the $10 for a house space.  Normally when you play, the $15 space will be unlocked after someone builds a 7th house.  And the $20 space is unlocked when we cycled through all the power plants.""

Building is the toughest for new players, as they may get blocked in easily.  Suggest the players to start anywhere, but I recommend showing them a visual example of how much money they have to pay for piping to get past someone that blocked them, so they understand about how they will get cornered in a region.

**First turn:  Bureaucracy**

""The moment you been waiting for!  The bureaucracy!""

""Get money!  What does that mean?  Count how many houses you have on the board.  That's the maximum number of houses you can light this turn.   If your plants let you light more than that, too bad, max is your houses.

Look at your plants.  See the resources you put on them?  It says at the bottom that you can discard those resources to power up those number of houses.  You can't use all the resources, you only doubled up resources while they were cheap so you can use them next turn.  So we will do this for each player, but next time we can all just do this at the same time.""

Now, look on the other side of the turn cards.   That is how much money you will get for the number of houses you powered.

Ahhhhhhh, this is all starting to come together isn't it?  

&lt;the rest of the beaucracy should be fairly easy to explain&gt;

**End of first turn**

""And that is it!  Would you all like to  start over, or keep going? "" 

**Second Turn**

Explain turn order.  Should be simple now to have them get set up.

""So, with your money, you will need to know how much you will spend on the power planet, resources, AND buildings.  So you are going to have to plan ahead, and maybe set aside money in your head, like ""i'll spend at most this much on power, this much on resources, and I should have enough of this money to build these houses.  The book doesn't say to hide your money or not, but avid Power Grid fans on reddit said you should hide your money, so we have to or they'll downvote us somehow.""

**Things to explain later**

When a player buys a 4th power plant, they must get rid of one, but can re-arrange the resources if they can fit somewhere.

How you can be ""that guy"" who inflates a bid.

***

**Common mistakes for new players**

Not having enough money to build.  

The 'worst begins'.   Players may get so excited about buying resources, and blocking everyone from all the cheap piping locations, only to realize they will now have to wait later.

Losing track of the objective.  2-3 turns before you think the game will end, its best to clarify exactly what it will take to win.  Mainly that having 7 houses may not mean you are guaranteed to win, you have to light them after all.  

***

**First time long game**

Playing the regular game is fine for your average avid gamer.  In this case you say the same thing, but you don't really need to mention Step 2 until someone builds a 4th house, or mention step 3 until shortly after step 2. 

It would also be good to clarify about the final round houses, and the importance of lighting up the most."	t5_2qmjp	True

We were playing Zombicide last night and the game pretty much boiled down to an alpha male dictating what the others would be doing the entire game. This has happened in previous Zombicide games with the same player doing the same thing. The first few times were ok since we were all learning the game, but it's gotten to the point where we don't strategize as a ""team"" anymore. It has really ruined the Zombicide gaming experience for me. I recently got Sentinels of the Multiverse and have been enjoying it, but I feel like the same situation would arise when we start playing it more.

Has anyone else had a similar experience with any co-op games? How did you handle those situations?

Another note: We were playing Misson 03 in the rulebook. But it pretty much boiled down to 1 player dead, 3 players driving the 3 cars driving around the block killing zombies, and 2 players sitting around doing nothing in the building. That was not a fun experience. "	t5_2qmjp	True

Is it just me or does Baratheon have too much easy access to uncontested territory when House Martell isn't in the game?  Maybe with everyone's inexperience we weren't taking it into account (or paying attention to how quickly one house was moving up the victory track).

1358267418.0	16mh5r	Are promises made to be broken in games? Where is the line drawn between what is acceptable and unacceptable betrayal/deception?	dougmansion	118	17	207	"The reason I ask is because of an infuriating game of Eclipse I played at a con last year. The situation was thus: two players had teamed up early in the game to their great mutual benefit, both expanding their territories and crushing their enemies. Near the end of the game, however, it became clear that one of the two was in a much better position to win than his ally, and would take the game if he was not betrayed then and there. So, after some cajoling by the rest of us, the weaker ally decided to betray his former friend.

The betrayed man was infuriated, and quickly went off the deep end. He shouted the former ally had ""promised"" to help him the rest of the game, that he lacked honor, and that the rest of us were honorless and craven for encouraging him to break his word. When we said this was just a game, he said a promise was a promise, and a man's word should not ever be broken. After a half an hour of arguing, the man turned to us, and said, ""You may win this game, but when you go to sleep tonight you know that you were honorless cowards who would do anything to just win."" With that, he left, and I, thank God, haven't seen him since.

I haven't lost a second of sleep because of this; alliances in games to me are fragile in their healthiest of states, and if a former ally must attack me to win, so be it. But this man obviously felt quite differently, and I wonder what the community thinks. Is there a place for honor in gaming? As long as one does not break the rules (or even the spirit of the rules), is anything else permitted? Does saying, ""I promise to _____"" make that pact any more wrong to break?

Looking forward to your thoughts, and thank you for your time.

A game requires at least 25% of the guild to have voted for a game to show up in the rankings. The new preliminary top 10 (rating is an average rating):

http://www.daysofwonder.com/memoir44-online/en/start/ (win/mac/linux)

This is a direct port of the boardgame to Windows, Mac &amp; Linux. 

For those that don't know the game, it is a 2-player WW2-themed light strategy. 

**Rules Overview**

[The board](http://www.thetoyboxgodalming.co.uk/USERIMAGES/memoir44_contents.jpg) is made up of hexes and divided into left, right and centre fronts, in either a inland or beach landings setting.

Players cards draw from a shared deck at the end of every turn. By choosing one card to play at the start of your turn, the cards allow you to order your units. More often in just one front but there are also cards for 2 or 3 front orders, and cards which allow you to choose a certain quantity of units from anywhere on the board, as well as many other special cards.

The units themselves move and attack according to their type, and attacks are played out by rolling a number of dice.
[The d6 dice themselves show: infantry x2, tank, grenade, retreat and star](http://www.dicecollector.com/WOOD_D6_DAYS_OF_WONDER_MEMOIR_44_01.jpg). If you roll the symbol for the type of unit you are attacking you get a hit. A grenade is always a hit, retreat usually causes the defending unit to move back a space, and stars are misses. 

Units can take a certain number of hits before being destroyed, denoted by how many models there are on the unit - eg. infantry has four models so it can take four hits before it is destroyed.
There is also terrain features, more specialised order cards, and more that I won't go in to here. You can [read the rules](http://static.daysofwonder.com/memoir44/en/img/mm_rules_part1_en.pdf) for info on these topics or just learn as you play by using right click to get info on an object.

**AIM**
The aim of the game is to be first to a certain number of victory points, either by completing mission objectives (usually holding map points) or destroying units, which always gains you 1 victory point.

**F2P restrictions**: the basic maps (I think 3 or 4) are free, but other maps cost gold ingots to unlock, you are given 50 of these with your free account, I have played many games and only used 3 ingots so far.

**Short Review** 4/5 - I really like this game, it strikes the right balance between luck and strategy to be fun and not too heavy, and contains some real strategic elements. It also has an interesting feature in that many maps are unbalanced, to reflect history. The average win rate by the allies is shown in the map selection menu by a percentage.

As always seems to be the case with boardgame ports to computer, the UI is lacking in polish and hamfistedly designed. On the other hand, one nice feature of the UI is that you can right click almost anything in-game and it will pop up the rules that apply to that object.

**TLDR;** Computer version of a light WW2 strategy boardgame available free to play! If you like Risk, you might like this too. Fun dice rolling action."	t5_2qmjp	True

1360159636.0	17zyr3	BSG - Sharing cylon reveal stories	jacobontheweb	109	12	95	"I had what I thought was a great reveal in a BSG game [last night](http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/17z4bo/never_seen_it_this_bad_after_just_one_round_yet/) and I want to hear more tales of tragedy and betrayal from the community!

I played as Baltar and one of my original loyalty cards made me a cylon, which can be tricky since he is usually a suspect from the beginning. I played as if I was a human to the point where I earned the complete trust of everyone else in the first half (everyone else was a human in the first half).

After the sleeper agent phase, Roslin (two players to my right) is dealt a cylon loyalty card and awkwardly reveals herself on her turn by choosing to resolve a cylon attack crisis card - ""Infer from this what you will,"" she said. So technically, she has not revealed herself, but her actions have made it obvious. **And then things get interesting.**

Immediately after her turn, she says ""What do I do if I have both cylon cards?"" I (an unrevealed cylon) see this as a brilliant play, while everyone else at the table sees it as a rookie mistake. My turn comes around, and everyone else urges me to check both of *her* loyalty cards to see if she's telling the truth. I, of course, agree to this, use my once per game, check both her loyalty cards, and report back ""Yup, she has both cylon cards."" The rest of the players are relieved to know there's only 1 cylon and we go about our business. 

Play goes around the table and on the turn before mine, I throw in a huge, negative vote on the crisis skill check, reveal myself as a cylon, throw the admiral (Adama) in the brig, and put the nail in the coffin for the humans. We (the two now-revealed cylons) slowly bleed their resources away and finish them off a short time later.

My family and I sat around and drank beer and wine and played my new game of Galaxy Trucker. We pulled the epidemic card seconds before midnight hit. My sister won the game by 23 credits (with a total of 84 to my 61) and my dad did pretty well despite it being his first game. (45 or so credits if I remember right)  Honorable mention for my sister's boyfriend for getting his level 3 ship blasted to the point where he just boosts into first at the end (open space) with only (iirc) 5 parts left, but only two were useful: one with one crew on it and the other with one yellow resource.  He ended up getting the bonus for being in first *as well as* the bonus for least open connections.  I was pretty proud of my 3rd level ship since I actually managed to kill the baddie that has 10 attack (I could get 10.5 with one battery or 12.5 using two) after it plowed through a couple people.

My mom even decided she wanted to sit and watch us play.  Looks like the top game on my wishlist ended up being a hit with the family.  I didn't even suggest playing Galaxy Trucker while waiting for midnight--my sister suggested playing it again and getting dad to try it.  There was confusion over the rules from all, but I expected them to struggle with it since it offers a lot more to remember than the classics they're used to and they ended up being really good at it.  Mom said she was still struggling with it a bit, but she said she wanted to read through the rule book some time (music to a board gamer's ears).  Sadly, I decided against taking a picture of the setup we had (and then was too busy enjoying the game to get an in game picture), but it was funny because dad's table is apparently exactly the right size for a 4 player game of Galaxy Trucker.

Before that, we had played UpWords--which my sister seems to always win.  If you haven't played it, it's like Scrabble without bonus tiles and where you get to stack letters on top of the words you've made so far (up to 5 tiles high) and score based on that--for instance, you get 1 point for each tile under each letter of your word and, if you change a second word with a letter in the word, you get to score the second word *(so if ""GOOD"" was on the bottom level and I played on top of the G to play ""FEAR"" down from there, I'd end up with 4 points for the letters in FEAR, 1 point for the G under the F, then 4 points for FOOD, and 1 point for the G under F for a total of 10 points.  Yes, the letter underneath the shared letter [F in this case] gets scored twice if you link words.)*  I won't even mention how much my sister slaughtered us in that game--my brain just decided not to register the information. ;)

Another nice board game related thing for New Year's Eve for me was that I got to show my daughter Ticket to Ride on my computer and she got excited about it and decided she wants it on her birthday wishlist.  She helped me play a base game of it.  I would tell her what colors we need and show her why (though I knew she's gloss over that) and she'd tell me what cards to draw and help me count how many more I need.  After we won the base game of it, she insisted that we play another.  I grabbed the $8 bundle from Steam, so we played TtR: Europe and I gave her an idea of how tunnels work--of course she loved the sound effects and trains flying back when the tunnel fails.  She loved it and insisted we play one more game, so I played the Legendary Asia map and, of course, she had good laughs at all the trains going away.  Debating on whether to put the Europe or USA map on her wishlist.  USA would be good for simplicity, but Europe would probably last her longer."	t5_2qmjp	True

He didn't even get to take his jacket off before leaving), but it seems some of you guys intentionally try to break games. That shirt would infuriate me - especially if it achieved nothing positive gameswise and was just to be a dick... 
 
So, what has some one done for your group to throw them out

edit: For those of you interested: changed use of the word ""stolen"" as some people are questioning it. Long and short of it is that the guy bent the truth/fabricated the truth/lied to a friend's girlfriend to get her to split up so he could swoop in, be the shoulder to cry on, and then crack on to her. Less of a ""hey, i know you're taken, but i could make you happier"", more of a ""im gunna split them up, so i can try and take her for myself"" thing. Takes two to tango, but still, none of us were comfortable with the idea of an evening of games with a guy who'd caused our friend so much recent heartache.

Perhaps less common is the moment of realization that they've made an error in strategy and will lose the game unless they make a better choice. How is this dealt with? Is it fair to go back? Unfair? Do you have a good house rule

* **Designer:** Corey Konieczka

* **Publisher:** Fantasy Flight Games

* **Year Released:** 2008

* **Game Mechanic:** Hidden Traitor, Variable Player Powers, Card Drafting, Hand Management, Dice Rolling

* **Number of Players:** 3-6 (best with 5; recommended 4-6)

* **Playing Time:** 180 minutes

* **Expansions:** [Exodus Expansion]( http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/85905/battlestar-galactica-exodus-expansion), [Pegasus Expansion]( http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/43539/battlestar-galactica-pegasus-expansion)

In Battlestar Galactica players take on the role of one of the characters from the tv show.  Each character has a special ability and a once per game ability that can be used to help them win the game as well as a limitation that may hinder their gameplay.  Humans work together to try and get the ship to Kobol before they run out of fuel, food, or a number of other resources, or before the ship takes on too much damage.  Cylons hide among the humans and do everything within their power to make sure the humans do not succeed.  Crises happen at the end of a players turn and may consist of a number of things that will set the humans back if they fail the crisis.  Players can try to pass them, but with cylons in around nothing is ever guaranteed…

1327667097.0	oz1qa	A review of how my non-gamer games night went last night!	DirtySketel	106	11	39	"We played games until we crashed at 3am. I suggested we stop at about 11. But my guests just wanted to keep playing.

That is how well it went last night. I was pretty nervous to start with (I always am before social events, despite being good at holding conversation and talking to a group), but my girlfriend and I are just over the moon about how much fun we had. We had a total of 7 people of mixed gender (and my housemate and his girlfriend joined in for half an hour too, though they are a little ill so retired to bed pretty quickly after). We started at 7 o'clock, or tried to at least and just chatted with drinks for 20 minutes. Then I cracked out our home-made version of the Resistance despite a couple of recommendations against it (which I'm still very thankful for). Our home-made version had pretend mission cards with silly parodies of a resistance against our own government (the kidnapping of Cameron Davidson was one of the missions, for instance). Thanks to a couple of extraverted people in the group, everyone got into it right away and we had a great time, despite it being clear that (unless we had got the rules wrong), it was virtually impossible for the Resistance to win in a group of 9 (housemates). We really found out who the best liars in the group were, we argued and fought and the first 2 rounds were so compelling we wanted to play again. Third round (by popular request) started to get a tad stale, with our blood pressure a little high from the arguments and a strong sense of fighting a losing battle.

After this, we brought everyone upstairs to our bedroom-cum-games room (it's basically just our bedroom but with a big table, strange setup but we're students it does the job). We had a coffee table by the bed with a load of snacks which, apart from the ever-unpopular twiglets, were made short work of.

My games were all arranged on the table. I gave a brief speech explaining that although they'd probably not seen any of these games before that they're a lot of fun, and that they're more modern and clever than games like Cluedo and Monopoly because you get to do more interesting things on your turn, and no one has to sit out of the game if they are eliminated. I held up a couple of examples of games they'd probably not even imagined, like Arkham Horror (explaining that it was a co-op game - a few people asked to play it but I said it was a bit too complicated for 7 people to learn in their first games night with beer) and Settlers Of Catan.

Then we played a quick round of the Rage Face drinking game, which was fun because I had a large foam dice to play with and we used some of the interesting pieces from my other games as counters, which was fun for everyone to see the Count Of Carcassonne racing around the board against the nun from Arkham Horror. 

Once we were merry, I split the group, and the table, into 2. A couple of the people there had played Settlers once before, so I suggested that they play a different game. They were happy to oblige (one of them had said before we started that he just wanted to try as many new things as possible to night) and sat down to choose a different game (from a refined list of simple games). I wanted the complete newbies to play Settlers because that game is great for new players - it just gets people thinking and talking while doing familiar things like rolling dice and building little Monopoly-like houses. Also, [Andy made this before the game even started](http://i.imgur.com/WdQqI.jpg). I explained the rules as I always do (‘This is the island of Catan, and we are explorers!’) but got kinda frustrated because the guys on the other table were just trying to chat with the people I was explaining the game to. I was patient, and just waited for them to finish, even though it took several false starts and I had to go over most of the rules again during play.

The other group selected Carcassonne as their game, and my girlfriend was at that table. She's not as confident speaking to groups, so I explained that one quickly and then left her to guide the new players through the game.

Both games went really well. I lost at Catan, which was fine, and everyone had great fun playing Carcassonne (my ‘trying new things’ friend kept looking over at me and saying excitable things like ‘This games is beautiful’ and ‘She took my city!!’)

After the games, my girlfriend and I were tired, but everyone wanted to play Cranium. Cranium goes on too long for the amount of fun you have playing it, but we just played until everyone was tired and ready to either go home or crash in our other room at 3.

We agreed that we would have another games night in a fortnight, this time with everyone bringing an interesting cheese (I fucking love cheese, and I love cheese and games even more). I think a lot of eyes were opened to the games possibilities. A lot of them wanted to get the two strategy games we played on their mobile devices, and one said he'd always been curious about table-top gaming but had never known anyone who played them.

Thanks for everyone's suggestions to improve the night - we read all of them, and some of them we couldn't do simply because we didn't have the games suggested, some of them we implemented and some of them we completely disagreed with, but thanks all the same!"	t5_2qmjp	True

* **Number of Players:** 2-4 (best with 2, 4)

In Race for the Galaxy, players will be racing to build a space empire and earn the most victory points.  Each turn players simultaneously select one of many actions to perform.  All players will be able to perform any selected actions, but the players that chose them will get a bonus with regards to the action.  Using these actions players will be able to draw more cards, build developments, and settle different planets.  Developments and planets will provide additional benefits to help players as they expand their empire (some planets can produce resources that can be traded for cards or consumed for victory points using actions).  At the end of the game whoever has the most victory points between chits earned from consumption and cards played into their tableau will win.

1348795122.0	10lgbx	Some thoughts to new boardgamers - it's OK to take it slow.	frosty_frog	108	18	70	"I've noticed a bit of a trend I wanted to discuss. It seems like I have been noticing more and more posts of people new to board games expanding their collections at rapid rates, and I am wondering if this is the best way to get into the hobby. It seems every day/week I see a new player looking to expand their collection quickly.

I understand the feeling of being new to boardgames and wanting to catch up to everyone else's impressive collections. They look so pretty on the shelf! And the games themselves, oh the games! There are so many that are so good, I feel your Pokemon-esque urge to collect 'em all!

What I think new players need to do though, is take a step back, and evaluate how many of these games are going to see serious table play in the next few months. Do you think you will play, say, 20 different games extensively in 3 months? I would bet that this is a Herculean task for even the most experienced of gamers, and I think it does a disservice to the great games in your burgeoning collection. I went through this phase myself, and looking back, I wish I had spent some more intimate time with the games I bought first, learning their in-and-outs... many of these games have great depth that you may not readily recognize on your first few playthroughs, or even your tenth, or fiftieth. I've played well over a hundred games of Dominion, and I see new and interesting interactions every day. And those 20 games you purchased in two weeks? In the time it takes you to get through them in any substantial manner, there will be even more, exciting games that catch your eye, perhaps luring you away from what you thought you might have wanted in the first place. Leave yourself some room to take your collection down paths you might not have initially foreseen.

I think a good starting collection would have 6-10 games of a wildly different mechanics and themes; find what you like from your gateways, and expand from there. It doesn't have to be a race to have a more extensive collection then the next guy!

Recently I had an idea to merge The Resistance with the theme of Team Fortress 2, a class-based free-to-play shooter for PC. Since I'm a sucker for re-skinning things, I thought I'd have a go at it.

[Here's a picture of the draft game assets!](http://i.imgur.com/EY6GiZA.jpg)

Here, it's the BLU team plotting their victory while a team of RED spies are in their midst creating a counter-strategy for their teammates. The playmats have screenshots of TF2 maps on them, the identity cards are shown with the different classes pictured, and the weapons are silhouettes of in-game ones.

Even though the game supports a max of 6 resistance members, I decided to make 8 cards, so as to include each class and eliminate bias. This also makes room for a potential game mode where the number of spies is unknown. Still working on that, but it's something I had in mind.

Legally speaking, I won't be able to distribute the game when it's done, with respect to the intellectual property of Indie Boards And Cards as well as Valve. But I'll be sure to share some pictures and things when it's done!

Even though I have all of the assets designed, it's still a work-in-progress as I'd like to get some criticism and tweak them a bit before printing. Not to mention I'll need a better printer than the one I have.

Please let me know what you think! I'd love to hear any comments or criticisms from Resistance and TF2 fans alike!"	t5_2qmjp	True

My great debate.	xpkoala	100	15	92	"So I am a big proponent of supporting local business, especially when local business is a game / hobby store.  However after just picking up a copy of Descent 2.0 at retail ($79.99) and seeing the same game go out the door online at ~$60.00 shipped it's becoming more difficult for me to justify dropping the cash in person rather than swiping a card online.

For picking up smaller expansions (Death Angel, Arkham Horror) I wouldn't mind spending $5.00 - $25.00 a pop, but for larger games, Android: Netrunner / Yggdrasil that I'm interested in, I'm looking at close to a 40% + markup.

My local hobby store does have a large back room with free space to play and lots of tables and terrain (if you are into tabletop wargames) with no charge for the amount of time you spend.  They only have a sign saying ""We can keep this area open for customers because of customers.""  And though I would love to use the back area most of my gaming nights happen at my house.

The staff is friendly and helpful, but since I'm not playing there I don't feel like a ""regular"".

1349715644.0	1158nr	What board game to you play to win, and what game do you never care if you win or lose?	CityWithoutMen	110	23	176	"For awhile I thought that most people either *always* played to win, or never cared if they did or not. I've found, for me personally, it all depends on the game. I'd guess that even people who play to win have a game or two that they don't mind losing.

So, on that sliding scale, what is the game you always want to win the most, and what do you play when you never care (or care the least) who the winner is?

For me:

**Play to win: Agricola** - Considering how much this game makes me feel like I'm barely scraping by, being forced to choose one thing that would help me most when I need to choose nearly everything at once. Even at the end of the game I feel like I never did that well. To work that hard and slave over every decision and *lose*? Soul crushing.

**Win to Play: Betrayal at House on the Hill** - No matter what happens, no matter when the haunt is revealed, no matter who the traitor is (though I do like to be the traitor), no matter if the traitor wins or if the heroes do, I love playing this game. It's just a lot of fun, and sometimes it has really good story telling experiences to it. It may not be balanced all that well, but it has solid mechanics and many great touches of inspired design.

However, it seems that there is no one around over the age of 7 who wants to play those games, anymore.  I feel like they're looked upon as ""baby games"", because they don't involve a lot of intense strategy, or take less time to play than some Euro style games take just to set up.
 
 
It's not that I dislike the more complex games - they're fun and stimulating (at least when I haven't worked a full week at an often mentally draining job) - but sometimes, I just want to play something that doesn't require a lot of thought.  Something where I can just roll my dice, move my little piece, and do what the space tells me to do.

well, the other night, we were pulling some games out, and he insisted that not only should we play Bang, but he should get to play his own hand!  i was dubious, but i decided after quizzing him on some of the cards (he got all of them right) that we should give it a go.

this kid was pretty amazing - he was the Sheriff, so he didn't have to worry too much about strategy, but he obviously had enough of a handle on the game that he played all of his cards correctly, and he ended up nearly winning!  even though he's the baby in the family, this was a real eye-opener as to how smart this kid really is....in two years, i'm going to lose every game i play against him.

Before you roll your eyes (or after depending on how impatient you are) allow me to explain; this isn't about the points totals.

I brought Agricola with us (the wife and I) to play while on holiday in the caravan. She's never played before and, while not a game-o-phobe, doesn't really like games so much. She'll play Ticket to Ride, Carcassone and other light-to-medium games but not too involved.

The children are asleep and we sit down to a game. At this point I must stress I'm not a great games teacher - really. No matter how excited or methodical I am, I seem to lose my way. The How to Play Podcast has a great article on how to teach a game so I've taken it to heart and did a decent job of teaching Tammany Hall to some friends as a result. With that experience in mind and taking some (if not most) of the points in Board Games with Scott's fabulous video on Agricola, I set up a family game and I begin to explain the rules.

Explaining the game backwards makes a lot of sense, here's what you score, here's what those things look like, here's how you get the stuff to make the things - and remember to feed your family. Hook, meat, hamster.

Worked like a charm.

On completing the game proper, the wife said she'd be willing to play again and even went as far as saying she enjoyed it.

I won on points but that was always going to be the case; points schmoints. The actual victory was not only getting a convert but being able to explain what is a tricky game to teach.

1365758700.0	1c73o8	Settlers of Catan, a good time was had by all.	Daekin	123	37	89	"I don't really do board games, besides when I was a kid. Snakes and Ladders, Monopoly, maybe Clue and some Sorry.

In my teens I got pretty deep in to Risk. I just loved it. But I always felt it kind of lacked something.

I'm 25 now, and I had heard, and seen much about this ""Settlers of Catan"" and after reading about it, and looking at pictures and stuff of the board, I brought it up to some buddies. The response was an uproarious ""Meh"", until just recently.

My buddies girlfriend endorsed it. Drops an ""Oh i'd *love* to play it"" so he decides to get me an early wedding gift (I'm getting married this year) so we can play some serious Settlers of Catan. *I was fucking stoked*

I had read enough and seen enough to know that, this is essentially Risk, meets Monopoly. Diplomatic Global Domination. I was prepared. The first game started at 11pm. It was me and my fiance, my friend and his girlfriend. It went slow as we learned the rules, and how each turn flowed ect. By the end of the first game we were pretty comfortable with how each turn worked.

My fiance called it at that, but my buddy **who had ""Meh'd"" the idea of Settlers** called for another game. This is now 2am. Now, this buddy of mine used to come for poker games, and is a classic early leaver. Calls it at like 9:30pm, never later than 11pm. **He is calling for another game at 2am**

Shit just got real.

My fiance is out, it's down to just the three of us. The first game ended with me being shut out, I went for a risky junction, and my own fiance cock-blocked me with the diplomatic helping hand of my two other opponents. The veteran (My friends girlfriend) won by a wide margin. But the second game, I knew what was what.

I knew what the numbers, colours, and important things were. I was truly ready this time. I knew, as this was my buddy and his woman, it was essentially a 2v1 game. I was outnumbered from the start.

I fought a hard game, winning longest road by getting a few lucky rolls of 4, which yields me 4 wood, and 2 clay each time. But, as I was the only one getting hit by robber, it was difficult to stay my ground.

Eventually, my buddy went balls deep into roads, stealing my road card when I hit 9 points. They were hitting my wheat fields hard, I just couldn't get any. They would accept no trades, as they knew I was too close to winning to risk it.

Then, my buddies girlfriend drops a huge bomb, buying up like 5 roads, and stealing the road card for herself, taking her to nine points, an upgrade or settlement away from victory.

I knew it was over for me, I needed too many roads, and my only source of wood was a 4. It was grim. With my wheat out of commission, I couldn't upgrade, build, or get dev cards. I was stagnated.

Once my buddy realized he was so far behind me and her, he had no chance, he just went in to full offensive, and tried to take whatever he can from whoever, however. He stalled her enough for me to draw even, at 9-9.

But alas, with me still 3 roads behind longest road, and no 4's in sight....I finally lost. She upgraded her settlement. It was over. We packed it all up, it was just after 4am.

This is literally the most fun I have had playing a board game, and recommend it to anyone and everyone. Just great fun. A guy who packs it up for the night at 10pm, played until 4am. If you knew him like I do, you would understand that endorsement is for fucking real.

**TL;DR** Played Settlers, fucking amazing, play it if you don't.

**Edit:** Sorry I don't have time to reply to everyone, but I just want to thank everyone for the suggestions and warm welcome to the genre. I definitely have some games to check out. I'm glad I was able to make people who havn't picked the game up in a while, dust it off and give it another go."	t5_2qmjp	True

1360085625.0	17xxf9	We played Eclipse for the first time Saturday, and loved it.	phreak64	100	12	35	"I'm sure that most of this is old hat to /r/boardgames, but we had a great time.

The first thing to know about the game is that the first time you play it, you've got a lot of reading to do, and you're going to be a bit confused.  The rulebook is fairly large and it's going to take a while to get the pieces organized and the play area set up.  As we read over the rules together, people were complaining about the relative complexity.  You kind of get the fear that people are going to turn on the game and not give it a fair shake, but after we got into the game, people calmed down and really got into it.  We had several exclamations of ""holy shit, this game is *cool*,"" though that could have been the beer talking.

In any case, the game looks and reads as intimidating.  And in some senses, it is that... but what you realize after playing a couple of turns is that it's an economy game with an awesome space setting (and combat!).  It also has a more limited set of actions than you'd expect after listening to the rules:  explore, influence, research, upgrade, build, or move.  However, the choice of what you'll do with each action is significant and the limited number of turns works to keep the game sane.

It's all about figuring out the path that works best for you:  maybe large exploration with large upkeep but large income, maybe a specialized economy, maybe trying to make everyone your friend and avoiding constructing things, etc.  Your goal isn't to wipe everyone else out (I imagine that it might be damn near impossible to actually take everyone else out by force), but to win victory points.  You get those through a variety of means.  You unveil a sector of space with some ancient aliens in it that need to be conquered, and it's adjacent to your area.  You don't have the force yet, or maybe it's close, but your neighbor might.  Do you go in early, before they can react, trying to secure it?  You'll get the victory points and production and whatever else, but what if they swoop in right after with your weakened fleet guarding the place?  Or do you let them take it and overproduce a dreadnaught or two the next turn and then take it back?  Maybe you can just leave it, expand outwards into space, and see where that takes you... but maybe you'll just discover rinky-dink little planets without much to write home about.  All of these questions balance out against your economy and your ability to improve yourself.

Research is SO key, but it can depend on your desired plan.  I had a friend that didn't pump his big ships out much... he spent small research on souped-up Interceptors and used them for small skirmishes, then spent a bunch of money and research building out Monoliths that grant 3 victory points apiece.  Meanwhile, the rest of us were exploring far-flung space and fighting each other... and he's the one that ended up with the most points.  The ""Traitor"" card kept people afraid enough to break their treaties with him, but really, they should have attacked him early.

In any case, the economic root to it makes it far more of a Euro game than you'd expect by its design and aesthetic, and I think it's what makes it so gripping.  Like many great games, you cannot possibly accomplish everything that you want, so you have to make decisions based on what you have and what you want, and hope that they turn out.  You really needed that Advanced Economy to make more money out of your home sector, but someone else grabbed that upgrade before you could.  What do you do?

This is early in the game.  I'm the red people, and also the ""banker,"" so note that every player really gets control of the panel on the right, not the big board on the left.

http://i.imgur.com/i5yUBVz.jpg

My main goal was exploration, and I was second place in the game, but was stymied by a few of my gambles.  I didn't have the fleet to take areas that were already occupied by ancient aliens, so I turned over a few cards that didn't produce anything for me until the very end of the game, when I had ultrabadass dreadnaughts to conquer the areas.  I should have produced some mid-level ships and gambled a bit... though my friend (the one that one) gambled a few times with his buffed-up interceptors and sent two different missions full of them to their deaths.  So it goes both ways.  I had another friend that assaulted the galaxy core with upgraded dreadnaughts twice, but just could not get lucky on any die rolls, and failed very hard.

This is later in the game.  The victor (the green player) was already taking down his pieces, but you can see how far out my empire had expanded.

http://i.imgur.com/y4y6eLq.jpg

Once you know what you're doing, I imagine you can knock out a game with 5 players in 2 hours, maybe 3.  It took us longer because the learning curve is really steep... but a short bit of playing and you really came to appreciate that much design.  Everything balances against everything else, and the wide scope of upgrades and research available gives everyone enough space to play exactly how they want to play... within their limitations.

Next game, we'll be playing with the alien races rather than the humans, to be sure.  The humans are all the exact same, but the aliens get a variety of fairly divergent bonuses, and those differences sound really fun.  We kind of started the game with people expecting to be drowning in management minutiae, but we ended the game with everyone very eager to play again as soon as we can."	t5_2qmjp	True

1371821030.0	1gsjg7	Game Giveaway, at long last.	Bohnanza	103	19	34	"After the surprising uproar over my question yesterday, I have decided that I will actually be giving some games away, and SOON. I guess I was unaware of how quickly time passes on Reddit.  I’m already getting PMs asking if it’s “too late” - and I haven’t even yet mentioned what the games might be!

I want to clarify a couple of things. These are games that I LIKE, that I’d like to play, and that I don’t really want to get rid of. However, there seems little chance that I will get to play any of them again, and I have way too many games in my collection. I have decided to give them away to find them “good homes”, which might not happen if I were to just sell or trade them. 

Although I am NOT really doing this “for charity”, of course my preference is to give them to people who don’t have a lot of cash or games. I actually have plenty of both, so I am not accepting any offers of money, geekgold, Reddit gold, and *definitely* no trades. I will pay shipping. I will consider shipping just about anywhere, but for me, it is easier to ship in the US.

To the people who have urged me to give them to charities instead, let me say that I think two of these games (at least) are not really suitable for schools or libraries. Rest assured that I do give games, money, blood, and time to charities on a regular basis.

To avoid making this more of a circus than it already is, just send me a PM telling me, briefly, which game you are interested in, and why I should send it to you. If you live outside of the US, let me know. DON’T give me your address unless I decide to send it to you. I will contact the ""winners"" via PM. Nobody is getting more than one game. I will decide, randomly if need be, who gets what. I will ship them next week.

To be clear, you must promise that you will *play* the game, and that you don’t already own a copy, etc., and you must also promise that if you play it and don’t like it, you will pass it on.

The games are:

1) [Battlestations](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12350/battlestations), including the Galactic Civil War expansion. The expansion includes what looks like a GREAT campaign. This is almost more of an RPG than a boardgame, and I have been unable to put together a group that will dedicate to playing it. To get this game, you must promise that you do have such a group.

2) [Barbarossa to Berlin](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3353/world-war-ii-barbarossa-to-berlin). This is a fairly serious “card-driven” wargame, using the system pioneered in Paths of Glory. My wargaming friends only want to play the “latest”, and so this sits on my shelf, gathering dust. Before you request this game, please understand that it takes 5 or 6 hours to play.

3) [Vinci](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/60/vinci). An all-time favorite of mine. In fact, this game has seen a lot of use and there is some box-scuffing. Nobody will play it anymore because it has been “superseded” by Small World. I am not convinced that this game is inferior, but regardless, it seems I will never get to play it again. To get this game, you must promise that you do NOT own Small World. FWIW I admit that this game COULD work in a school environment, and I will give consideration to requests for that purpose.

**Update: Due to the huge volume of responses, and due to the fact that I have to mow the lawn this morning, I will get to this either this afternoon or tonight. Sorry, and thanks for your patience.**

**Update II: I notified the ""winners"" last night. I will give them each a couple of days to respond before I decide if I will give the game to somebody else. I will wait and send them all at the same time to save myself trips to the post office.** 

**Some of you might wonder how I chose the ""winners"". I read each message, but then decided that it was impossible for me to fairly select which was the ""most deserving"", so I chose randomly from among ""qualifying entries"".  So don't feel bad if you didn't win, it was just dumb luck.**

**Update III: Games have been packed and will ship tomorrow. Hopefully I will ship the right games to the right people!!**"	t5_2qmjp	True

[Netrunner storage box](http://imgur.com/a/yPUX2#0)

Here's a breakdown of what I did

1.Bought the [famous Hobby Lobby box](http://shop.hobbylobby.com/products/wooden-artist-case-125005/) that everyone is using for Dominion storage (including the current Kickstarter project that I just can't believe people are willing to pay $300+ for an unfinished box, but I digress).  This is available at Hobby Lobby for $20 and they always have a 40% off coupon that you can use to get it for cheaper.

2.Found and downloaded the pics from google.  I took some pics that were about 1600x1200 and used Perfect Resize and quadrupled the resolution and printed it out on my Canon Pro Mark II on a 13""x19"" Canon Matte paper.

3.Took the box and started staining it.  I did about 4-5 different layers of stain and did mostly dark walnut but also did a couple layers of black so that it's darker than what you would get with just the dark brown.

4.Took the printed out pics, cut it to fit the top of the box and glued it on with some Mod podge

5.Once tried, started doing the coats of Polyeurathane.  I have no idea how many coats I had to do on the top and bottom but I would say there's at least 10 on each side.  If you plan to do this yourself, keep in mind that whatever picture you use, the Polyeurthane will add a brown filter to the pic as the liquid itself is brown.

6.Once I was happy with the Polyeurathane layer, I added the felt.  Cut the pieces to make sure they fit and then used Scott 77 Spray Adhesive to glue it to the bottom of the box (top and bottom layers)"	t5_2qmjp	True
1373434044.0	1hzndl	The difference between a designer and a publisher	IngredientX	105	19	21	"One thing I keep seeing here is that people keep on blaming designers for a publisher's decision. For example, I'll read things like, ""Why did the designer set up the insert this way?"", and ""How come the designer made the player boards so thin?""

At a recent con, I ran into a designer friend of mine who designed the popular miniatures game of a science fiction franchise. The quality of the minis were not as high as fans were expecting, and a lot of people spewed vitriol towards the designer. All he could do was shrug; component quality is rarely in a designer's hands, so he had no way to change the situation.

Sadly, lots of game fans don't understand this, and can unfairly target the designer for decisions made by the publisher. So, here's a quick guide to who's responsible for what:

A *designer* is responsible for the rules to a board game. He will spend years making sure the gameplay is balanced and fun. 

A *publisher* is the one who assumes the financial risk in paying for the print run, so he will make decisions regarding artwork, layout, quality of physical components, and cost of the game.

If a designer is self-publishing, then he will be a publisher as well, and therefore be responsible for publisher's decisions. But most of the time, the publisher and designer two different people. 

There are times when a publisher will tweak a game rule himself, or even publish only a subset of the game rules, but that tends to [fail](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5767/mammoth-hunters) more often than it [succeeds](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/74/apples-to-apples). These days, a publisher will suggest rules tweaks, but leave it to the designer to put in the exact implementation. 

The designer is mainly responsible for the rulebook and card text. The publisher will sometimes run both by an editor to make sure there aren't any glaring problems, but the designer is responsible for most of the work there.

EDIT: If the game is published in a country other than the designer's home country, then the publisher is on the hook for the rules translation. I've updated the summary below with that clarification.

Sometimes a publisher will have a *developer* work on balancing the game past what the designer did. A developer makes incremental rules tweaks, sweats over tiny changes in card text, and makes sure all paths to victory are balanced.

Not all publishers do this, because developers don't always work for free. But they do really good work. Some notable recent developer work: Valerie Putman and Dale Yu with Dominion, Uwe Rosenberg with Terra Mystica, and Seth Jaffee with just about every Tasty Minstrel game.

So, if you have issues with any of the following, you want to complain about the *publisher's* decision:

* Component quality

* Cost of the game

* Art

* Layout

* Hard-to-understand text (if the game was translated)

If you have problems with any of the following, you have a gripe with the *designer* (and sometimes the *developer*):

* Rules balance

* Hard-to-understand text (if the game is in its original language)

* Lots of errata

1362974310.0	1a2a7f	What's the biggest mistake you've made since starting on this hobby?	Shoeby	95	11	269	"I'm curious as to what some other people's biggest mistakes were since they've started collecting/playing board games.  Whether it's a misinterpretation of rules, accidentally throwing out meeples, whatever it is, feel free to share and let's all have a laugh.  

Here's mine.  Thankfully this didn't cost anything.

I had just finished participating in the Ringing in the New Year math trade on BGG, and I was surprised to learn that the USPS has ""Board Game"" Priority mail large flat rate boxes.  These are longer than normal boxes, and are great for things like Axis and Allies, or Mall Madness.

Of course I call my local post office, ask if they have some, and they say of course they do.  I drive over and they hand me one.  I ask if they have any more, because I ship a lot of board games.  Of course they don't have any more.

So, I figure that I'll get myself ready for the next math trade and order a few boxes from the USPS website.  I fire up the computer and put in a quantity of 20, and boom I'm good to go. 

Come home a week later, and literally, cannot get to the door of my house.  Turns out the postal service when they were asking quantity were wondering how many ***Cases*** of Flat rate Board Game boxes I wanted.  So instead of 20 boxes at my doorstep, there are 500 (20 Cases, 25 per case).

[Image relevant](http://i.imgur.com/yBoUezO.jpg)

So now I've resigned myself to taking 3 or 4 cases of these stupid things and leaving them at local post offices in my area.  I walked in my closest post office, and they had literally 30 of them pre-folded, practically begging people to take them.  And of course I've still got 7 cases left at home.

Like I said, didn't cost me anything so that's good, and I went back to check the USPS website, and it clearly says cases.  I attribute the mistake to fatigue."	t5_2qmjp	True
1358348117.0	16oq0p	Merchant of Venus is awesome.	sanildefanso	94	14	46	"I'm not usually one to post stuff like this, but I was a little blown away...

I have played the original Merchant of Venus a couple of times, and I really like it. I think FFG's reprint is good if just for the fact that they did such a good job on the classic version. But I didn't think I'd be that blown away by the new version.

Well, I solo'd a two-player game last night, and color me surprised, but I LOVED the redesign. It preserves pretty much all of the stuff I loved about the original, while emphasizing the aspects of the design that I liked the most (the exploration and the more ""adventure-y"" elements). I reserve the right to revise my opinion once I've played with real opponents, but my first impression was super positive.

So all that to say, you guys should all buy this game. Both versions by themselves would be awesome, but the tremendous value represented by having both in one package makes it one of the best reprints I've seen in the last five years."	t5_2qmjp	True

It turns out the spies have a choice whether or not to sabotage a mission.

GreyTabbyRaikov	109	30	38	"So last weekend I went on a cabin trip and I played a game with about 8 people called ""Eat Poop You Cat"". I was drunk so I might be a little off on the name. This game can be played by anyone with like 8 or so pens and 8 or so pieces of paper.

Basically everyone starts out with a pen and a paper. Everyone then writes a sentence. The sentence can be anything you want. 

Next every one passes the paper to their left. Now on the paper you have received you draw a picture of the sentence on it. Then you fold over the sentence so the next person can't see it and you all pass to the left again. 

The next paper you receive you will write a sentence on it that accurately describes the picture. You fold the paper over the picture so the next player can't see it. Then you again all pass the paper to the left again.  

This process continues until your original paper returns to you. You might want to write your name at the bottom to keep track.(especially if you are drunk). This games purpose is to create laughs.

* Power Grid: Pull 8 plants from the plant deck. Every player gets an option to take one or skip to the next round, in a random order. The lucky bastard who got the one plant with a fuel type that no one else has wins.

We've been building up to this for a while now. Spent some time figuring out how to merge everything and decided last night to give it a go.

We used the ""Traders and Barbarians"" and ""Barbarian Attack"" scenarios from the Traders and Barbarians set and played to 27. Used all the new Explorers and Pirates elements.

/u/bepeacock was the mastermind behind all the rules we used, I'll make sure he's around if anyone has questions. It was quite the game.

EDIT: We've posted the rules we used here: http://specialbuildingphase.com/ultra_catan.html. Any feedback would be awesome."	t5_2qmjp	True

Today, with a little less persuasion, we played King of Tokyo.  The start was a bit quiet but as the five of us took our turns the tension started to build.  Monsters began to die out. I ended up in Tokyo against a points hoarder who won it with a double-2 (with two dice) on the last roll of his turn!  There were cheers and a round of applause.  Lots of fun was had.

The tidy-up operation came and as the other players went back to their desks, they were chatting amongst themselves about how fun it was and certainly a welcome distraction.

You might be surprised at the results. 		96	14	98	"Original thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/zngnu/what_game_did_you_instantly_fall_in_love_with/

First off, here are your top 10 most beloved board games according to the numbers I've crunched:
(EDIT: There's a few ties, and Reddit or RES won't let me put the same number twice in this list, but you can tell which ones are tied).

 1. 7 Wonders (Score: 28)
 2. Carcassonne (Score: 24)
 3. Agricola (Score: 19)
 4. Race for the Galaxy	(Score: 18)
 5. Twilight Struggle (Score: 16)
 6. Lords of Waterdeep	(Score: 13)
 6. Puerto Rico (Score: 13)
 8. Chaos in the Old World (Score: 12)
 8. Through the Ages (Score: 12)
 10. Bang! (Score: 11)
 10. Battlestar Galactica	 (Score: 11)

Your *bottom* 10 are:

1. Munchkin (Score: -74)
2. Settlers of Catan (All variations) (Score: -46)
3. Zombies!!! (Score: -15)
4. Thunderstone (Score: -14)
4. Apples to Apples (Score: -14)
6. Fluxx (Score: -12)
7. Risk (all variations except Risk: Legacy) (Score: -8)
7. Monopoly (All variations) (Score: -8)
9. Quelf (Score: -7)
9. Last Night on Earth (Score: -7)
9. Cranium (Score: -7)


I've named a few awards: 

**""The game mostly likely to make you say ""Oooh! This is awesome!"" but later reconsider your love for it.""** Award goes to **Settlers of Catan** with 23 votes for hatred over long term. 

**Runners up:** Tied at 17, **Dominion** and **Munchkin**. 

**Commentary:** *I have to say that collating the votes for Dominion was one of the more interesting things to come out of this. Very very few hate it at first, in fact it got the most mentions for ""Insta-love"", but over time the camps split hard to each side with dislike coming out on top nearly 2 to 1). Who's to say if the longer run favours dislike or like? It's surprising because of all the love that game receives around here.*

**The Award for Most Hatred Directed toward Inanimate Paper Pieces** Goes to: Munchkin (all variations). 

**Commentary:** *Seriously, this game got slaughtered. This much hatred can't be healthy. Maybe we should all go see a doctor.*

**The No Hatred, Most Love Award** Goes to: **Twilight Struggle**

**The No Love, Most Hatred Award** Goes to: We have a tie, folks! Both **Fluxx** and **Zombies!!!** are equally despised with no love. 

**Commentary:** * I expected **Fluxx** to walk away with this award, but **Zombies!!!** ~~came~~ zombie-walked up from the rear at the last second to earn a well-deserved tie.*
 

That's all for now, if you've got any other awards you'd like to see me calculate, I'll see what I can do. Just leave suggestions in the comments and vote up your favourites. 

EDIT: 
If you adjust all the scores upward to compensate for the negative numbers (ie. add 74 to everything to make Munchkin rated at 0), the average score is 75.28 with the top score (7 Wonders) at 102. It's pretty obvious people like to pick on Settlers and Munchkin. The scores descend quite regularly until dropping off a cliff for Settlers (Adjusted score of 28) and Munchkin (Adjusted score of 0).

1332895527.0	rgr19	"SecretSanta, ""Serious"" board games, and YOU"	Trenzor	112	31	79	"First and foremost I'd like to thank the Reddit SecretSanta folks for putting this on for us. I'd also like to welcome all our new visitors that have learned of this great subreddit from the exchange. I hope you all subscribe and join us in keeping up with this fun hobby.

There has been tons of discussion/debate about this exchange already and I think it's important we get this all in sorted out in a central place sooner rather than later. Most of the confusion is coming from the description of the exchange: 

&gt;If you are into serious board games (not Monopoly) and are looking to expand your collection and share your interest with others, this exchange is for you! If you used to play Monopoly and think it might be fun to play a board game again, this is not the exchange for you! Sorry guys, but this one is for board game enthusiasts!

&gt;If that’s you, you should totally join us. It’ll be super fun!

To those of us in the hobby this probably makes total sense. But for some it may not be so clear. Let's fix that. 

""Serious"" was a poor choice in wording. What would have been more accurate was saying this exchange is focused on (but not exclusive to) **modern, designer board games**. If you are unfamiliar with this area that's not a problem! Please still join us in the exchange if you're interested! It simply means you'll need to do a bit of research but I'm sure you're capable of that (you're a Redditor afterall, :P). As has been suggested by some others [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATnXloqRfdA) is a great starting point, as is [the BoardGameGeek top games list](http://boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgame), and the [most current ""Top 10"" games thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/qcmdh/rboardgames_hot_10_what_boardgames_are_we_playing/) in this very subreddit. None of these should be seen as the be-all-end-all reference for this exchange but are great starting points for what ""serious"" games they were talking about.

Now, all that said there is no reason you can't send something that doesn't fit the above description if that's what your giftee is looking for.

I know to some people this subreddit is oozing elitism right now, and to some extent they are correct. Many gamers here are getting worried about ""non-gamers"" doing it wrong. I don't think they're trying to be intentionally dickish though. User johnhutch made an excellent analogy I think more people should read:

&gt;Being serious about games is about the same as being serious about literature. You enjoy them, you think about them, you weigh and consider their positives and negatives, and you discuss and explore them at length. The joy of a board game exchange is knowing that you're going to get something that someone else spent some time playing and considering; that you, yourself, will get to explore that game and discover its intricacies. The reason Monopoly, Sorry, Taboo, or other such games aren't encouraged is simply because there is very little depth in to be plumbed. Sure, they may be a way to kill time with from friends, but to someone serious about board games, they're about as shallow and unrewarding as an english major reading Twilight.

The only other point I'd like to discuss is how the exchange will actually work. No, you're not expected to spend $40 or $50 on this in order to participate. There are many respectable games under $20. If you can't find them, ask. There are plenty of us willing to point you in the right direction. Just like every other SS exchange the focus is the giving, not receiving. If you are going to be upset that the game you get isn't as valuable as the one you sent, don't sign up. Give what you can and appreciate what you receieve. I don't see why we can't all be mature about that. 

Again, big thanks to the SecretSanta folks! I can't wait to see what I get!

EDIT: There is another common question I would like to address here - used games. **GENTLY** used games (as in never/rarely played, looks brand new, no wear or tear on box or components) while likely not preferred by anyone will be ok if they fit what your giftee is looking for. This exchange **IS NOT** about getting games off your shelf that don't get play time. We will be doing another math trade in the future and when that comes around you can attempt to unload all your crap there. This trade is about picking a gift for someone that they will enjoy. That means for some people giving them Munchkin could be great, but for others you'd be breaking their heart. Bottom line: if having to put time and effort into finding an appropriate game that you may very well need to spend money on is not something you're interested in, please consider not joining this exchange.

Did you or the people you bought the game for enjoy it? Were people enthusiastic about the game you played?  Is there anything that could be improved upon for next time?

Tiles have functions that activate when the tile is placed and two dice are rolled to determine what actions the player can take.  Players have some control over the dice, mitigating luck.

Ah, sweet memories of childhood. This here is a hand-drawn board for a Soviet board game called Pirates, pre-dating the MicroProse classic by half a century; it was created in 1934, almost went to print during the Great Purge, spent some fifty years gathering dust in an attic after its creator was sent to GULAG, and then finally saw the light of the day in 1989, when it was published in a Soviet teenage magazine called Pioneer. Naturally, we played the hell out of it — and, thanks to the power of internet, you can now do the same.

1375163712.0	1jbz3m	The best-worst game of Risk ever.	alias-of-a-girl	101	24	24	"http://i.imgur.com/NpjWKGJ.jpg

So my friends and I decided to have this enormous game of (badly imbalanced) Risk. The two earths were trying to invade middle earth while middle earth was trying to 'close the portals' by bringing the ring to Greenland on each map (for some reason). We recognized right off the bat that the game was super imbalanced and started making up extra rules to try to fix it. In the end, making up the rules (and the flavour) was more entertaining than the game itself, which lasted a maximum of four rounds and involved several mid-game rule changes.

It was a glorious, epic monstrosity of a game that will be remembered forever.

Edit: since everyone is asking about the rules, I shall try to explain them (but remember try changed at least 3 times, so it might be a bit confusing).

We started with three teams, one on each board, and each time started with total control of their own board. The winning conditions for the two regular earths was control of the opposing earth. Middle earth's win condition was to get the ring from one Greenland to the other.

Because middle earth was at such a disadvantage, we started off with the following action order: Earth 1, Middle Earth, Earth 2, Middle Earth. Initially ME was getting twice the reinforcements, then we brought that down to normal numbers per round.

There were a couple other tweaks and changes concerning card rules and heroes, but I don't remember those details because we didn't use them much.

The game only lasted about 4 rounds because by that point it was clear who was going to win (Earth 2 because Middle Earth ignored them in favour of attacking Earth 1, so Earth 2 was sweeping through Middle Earth and neither ME or E1 had the resources to fight back)."	t5_2qmjp	True

During that time, I've occasionally submitted a review that I've written on my site (Board Game Reviews by Josh).  I generally try to make sure that it's something that I haven't seen reviewed in the sub already, and I try to keep it to only once a month or so, so that it doesn't come off as spam (I know that there was someone that linked *all* of their posts as I was just starting to follow the sub, and it was considered spam, and so the moderators addressed it.  I've been cautiously trying to avoid that.)

So - with all of that said, I generally get more upvotes than down when I share a review.  And it makes me wonder - how often do you guys like to see reviews in this subreddit?  Obviously, the point of the sub is to have discussion, so I make sure that when I post something here, I also follow/continue the discussion about the game that arises from it.  But, with that said, is once a month a good rate?  Would you be interested in seeing more of them?  Do you only like to see games that I really liked, and gave a good review to, or would you be interested in reading about games that I didn't like as much?

TexJester	87	10	138	"We've had a few users show interest lately in setting up a more reliable form of trading and advertising on this subreddit that doesn't involve BGG.  Henceforth, the mods will be posting a monthly thread, that will be a place to post and discuss games you own and are looking to trade.  

Every month we will start a new thread at the start of the month.  There will be a link to the thread in the sidebar/header for easy access all month long.  

There will be rules and a format you are expected to follow if you post.  Your posts and comments will be deleted if you do not adhere to the guidelines:

**Formatting:**

When listing games, you MUST include this information:  Game, Edition/year, Box Condition, Component Condition, and any other relevant information.  Be specific!  Don't exaggerate or lie about this.  We will be very strict about this, and if we have a single problem here, we are scrapping this feature, and banning the offender(s).   You will leave feedback for your trade partner.  


[H] - Have(games you have you are willing to trade).  
[W] - Want(games you are looking to trade for).

[H/FS] - Have, For Sale.(If you are looking to sell the game for money).  Please include details, such as an asking price,   
[H/FT] - Have, For Trade(If you are looking to trade your game for another game).

**Logistics:**

-If you are interested in an offer, leave a comment under their listing, and/or PM them about a potential trade.  Be civil and courteous.  

-The buyer will pay the shipping costs, unless you plan to work out your own arrangements. Be mindful of geography. Use shipping tracking numbers, and share them with your trade partner.  

-Shippers will refer to [this guide](http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/196679/guide-to-packaging) on shipping/packaging games.  Poor shipping practices are unacceptable.  

-Both parties will leave feedback underneath the comment in the Bazaar thread.  Be truthful, and blunt.  (Also, it is recommended that you setup/leave trade feedback through BGG). 

-Spell your items correctly, in full.(for search purposes).

- **EVERYTHING IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY!** Communicate with your trade partner and work things out yourselves.  The mods are in no-way involved in this, we are just giving you all a place to post/trade since you asked for it.  Don't message us about trade advice or questions.  Only If there is a serious problem, message ME(Texjester).

We haven't had it long, maybe our 3nd time ever playing, and it was the closest I had ever come to winning as Jack. I made the mistake of flipping the ""seen"" marker to the wrong side and didn't notice until he flipped over the token I was. So he figured out who I was from that and capitilized on it. Right before he did it he says ""I know it's lame but I hate losing so..."" and it made me so mad.  

Not only because I had messed up what was a pretty good game for me but because he needed to win so badly that he couldn't let that slide. Despite the fact that the game previously, when he had been playing Jack, he was fiddling with his card and accidently flashed who he was. I let it slide, pretended I didn't see it, and kept playing the game to it's natural conclusion.

I guess what left such a sour taste in my mouth was the win at the cost of playing the game. It drained what could have still been a fun experience to a hollow victory."	t5_2qmjp	True

Much of the time I've been the teacher and I try to pride myself on my rules explaining ability but many times I've been under prepared and just screwed something up. 

Some recent examples have been:

**Ticket to Ride** - thinking that you could select a card AND build a route in your turn (instead of just one of those)

**Eclipse** - thinking combat just went for one round for each ship and weapon type (i.e. all missiles first then your other weapons by initiative but just once each). It made missiles seem really over powered and it was just 
impossible to kill things (due to the repair at the end of turn)

**Android: Netrunner** - that you had to match the strength of ice to get past it (as runner) at all, not just to interact with the subroutines.

Actually, come to think of I've usually made a massive mistake in playing almost every game for the first time but these have been the really big game balance altering ones."	t5_2qmjp	True

Then I came here and was slightly disappointed. Nah I'm kidding, I found a great place (i mostly lurk) and since have played Settler, 7 wonders, CAH, and Ticket to Ride, and have a to-play list. It allowed me to reach out and I found [this place](http://www.gamerterrain.com/?page_id=2) near my town. (don't click it yet!)
  
Okay enough back story (sort of). I also am a local journalist and the owners of the above place have also done something else really cool. They opened up a restaurant called the [Game Master Grill](http://www.gamemastergrill.com/) that is board gamed themed and I had [to cover it](http://mineola.patch.com/articles/playing-with-your-food-at-game-master-grill) since it was new in town. You can go and get dinner, food is excellent btw, and buy a game and play. I asked him and you can bring your own too or just play one of the small dice or card of board games that he has there while you wait for your food. You can play/eat/eat/then play/show up start playing and throughout or take a break to eat, if you want to take a while go on a slower night and hang out. They'll even deliver a board game with your order. It is a really neat idea and a cool place.  
  
Generally it is a fun store and really nice. The staff will all teach you games. I've ate a couple times there and they helped teach my girlfriend a couple games as well,as taught us both some small games, when we didn't want to stay too long, to play while we waited for our food. They even have a neat zombie dice game! The place hasn't picked up too quickly though and could use more exposure. The owner is a greatguy who worked in the restaurant business for 17 years, got an opportunity to open a board game store a few years ago and took it. He is a veteran, a good guy, and passionate about board games, particularly about teaching people how to play new games. I want to see if I can help the place out by showing you guys a cool place you'd appreciate (maybe spurn a new idea for a restaurateur out there) and get him more exposure. Tell your NY/Long Island buddies about it. Go yourself if you are in the area, check out his site (the menu is super neat and creative with the titles of some dishes).  
  
Again here is the site for the restaurant [Game Master Grill](http://www.gamemastergrill.com/) and this is the, linked above too [article] (http://mineola.patch.com/articles/playing-with-your-food-at-game-master-grillhttp://www.gamemastergrill.com/) I wrote about the place. I don't need ""views or anything"" I'm actually an intern so I don't even get paid. I just thought the article was relevant to help spread the word. I was going to just make a post like check out this place, with the link, but I wanted to be upfront with my intentions and let everyone know a little more about the place. So thank's again guys for anyone and even if it's only one person chcking it out! PM if you have questions or anything.

Since I've started the class a few of my students have begun borrowing games over the weekend to play with family.  I gave an aide Coloretto as a ""thank you"" gift.  After break, she told me that her daughter has been playing it 10-20 times a day with her boyfriend and they went out and started getting other games.  Just now a woman who supports one of my students told me she's hosting a game night tonight even though she hadn't played a board game since childhood until this class.  Another aide who I gave The Resistance to said he played it with his family when they were all together for Christmas and had a blast while getting to see sides of them that he'd never seen before.

Makes me all warm and fuzzy.

1338132559.0	u7cbl	I threw my 1st board game night last night.	Parvan	93	17	69	"I've been wanting to do a boardgame night for awhile, but none of my friends had ever played any designer games before. They are pretty damn geeky so I knew it would just take once to get them hooked, but it was proving to be impossible to get them all over to play. I had gotten two of my friends to a previous game but other than that I had to make due with hijacking my daughter's friends to get my board gaming fix. I've been wanting to get a regular group going for awhile, but it was proving rather difficult.

On Friday I decided to give it another shot. I set up the FB event and sent it out, I'll admit I was a little surprised when I saw people start accepting. Fast forward to Saturday and it's 15 minutes past start time when the first person shows up. Not to be deterred I break out Forbidden Island, go over the rules and start playing with him and my daughter, figuring that I can at least convert one friend to the dark side. Halfway through the game another shows up, then 3 people, then one of my daughter's friends. I got a little panicky because here I was trapped in a game and I have 5 people sitting around not playing games. As soon as we lost Forbidden Island I stuck my daughter and her friend on it and broke out Carcassonne. I didn't play, and instead walked them through the game, pointing out strategies and possible moves. It was pretty fucking awesome watching everyone get involved and talking about how much fun they were having. 

I did feel bad leaving my daughter and her friend out of the group though so once Carcassonne wrapped up I broke out Elder Signs (the only thing I have besides Arkham Horror that can accomodate 7 people). It was a huge hit. Turns went really smooth and even with the downtime between turns people were staying involved. We beat Cthulhu with 5 doom token left to go. It was pretty late at that point so I sent my daughter and her friend to the small table where they appropriately enough played Small World. I busted out Carcassonne with Inns and Cathedrals, explained the new rules to the group and joined them for a game. It was won by one with one of the noobies beating me by 3 points. 

In short it was an awesome night. I introduced 4 new people to an awesome hobby and everyone had a great time. I'm hoping we can make this a regular occurrence because I am aching to get a chance to play Risk: Legacy.

**tl;dr** Night was a resounding success, if it keeps going like this I am going to need to up my collection of large group games.

**Edit** If you wanted a tale of me actually throwing a board game I am sorry to disappoint you, I'll choose a better title next time.

So I've been really in to board games for a long time.  Since I was a kid I played lots of board games but they kinda fizzled out in high school.  My college happened to have a popular game design program and there I met lots of kids in to some cool board games that I had never heard of.  This is where my love for board games came to light.

Flash forward 8 years later.  I live in NYC and I have never had a solid crew of people to play board games with.  Last Thursday I convinced a friend to come with me to a local games store to check out their ""board game night.""  You can play virtually any game you want or you can sign up for the ""game tutorial"" which is where a guy leads you through the board game of the night.  This night happened to be Betrayal at the House on the Hill.  We loved it and bought it.

Fast forward to Hurricane Sandy.  Some friends come over to play games and wait out the storm.  We played tons of games of Betrayal and Dixit (which I also bought that Thursday night) and had a blast.  Tonight, the streak continues from Sunday.  We've been playing these games non stop.  I told them about the board game night and tomorrow we're all taking a cab to the store to play games and what-not.

Nothing like a natural disaster to show people how much board games have progressed since the days of Trouble and Mouse Trap (although I still claim Stratego is an awesome game.)

Has anyone else had to help friends discover board games?  What was your strategy?

**TL;DR** Natural disaster forced us to play board games.  Friends loved it."	t5_2qmjp	True

I decided to play Saul to try out being Admiral.  I realised after we started that I was in a great position because I could declare martial law if I felt that my friend playing the President was a Cylon.  My friend playing Kara decided to play it safe and pretend to be a huge help to us early game despite having gnabbed the Cylon card from the start.  I was unsure of him because of how he responded to some of our crises, so I didn't fully fall for his ruse.  I yelled ""Cylon!"" at him at least 4 or 5 times...and only a couple were joking.  ;)  

Eventually, the President pointed out he could put anyone in the brig which scared my friend playing Kara into revealing he's a Cylon.  I had wasted my first nuke clearing out the first basestar and Kara soon put another Cylon swarm into play that I had to nuke (it had two base stars with one right next to civilian ships).  Then Kara really dropped the bomb on us...literally.  Colonial 1 got bombed right when we were going to recover with some Quorum cards.  We soon after got through to the end game described in my album: http://imgur.com/a/Ok1fU 

I'm surprised we survived.  Absolutely love that I got this amazing game for $25 from a fellow Redditor (NoodlePDX).  

We're all excited to play another game in the near future and hopefully get it up to 5 or 6 players next time.  I should be going to a FLGS tomorrow to try out the Pegasus expansion.  :)

How was your first BSG experience? (if you remember it)  Do you prefer being the hero or the Cylon?  I know I want to get a shot at being the Cylon some time.  It looks like a lot of fun.  (Also feel free to shoot questions about what went down in this game of BSG if you want.  I'll try to remember details.)

Edit: [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/12dxv6/my_first_official_bsg_game_with_friends_was_quite/c6uh8ed) was my ""unofficial"" game.  I don't really count it because we were playing it wrong (in the sense of playing more than one character)--although we did a great job of not metagaming.

About a year ago, a local gaming store went out of business.  I have always dreamed of wanting to own a store, but don't have the talent to model and paint to display quality.  So, I spoke with the owner and negotiated to buy most of his display tables and demo figures that had been painted quite nicely.

This included about 10 2x2 demo terrain boards including a rather massive custom built castle for Super Dungeon Explore.  I took it all home, wrapped it up and plastic, and stored it.

Fast forward to today, and I was notified by the original shop owner that the Cool Minis Or Not was looking to get the castle back (to display at GenCon), and that it had been sold to me accidentally.  They're a local company, so I called them, and a few hours later, they came over to pick up the model, and left me with two NIB copies of Zombicide for my troubles.

Edit: Here's a [link](http://imgur.com/wCbNJyt) to the one photograph I have of the castle, since a couple folks asked for it.

1375449461.0	1jk8ps	Eclipse Review: One Year Later	boardgameben	81	8	40	"I received Eclipse about a year ago as a birthday gift. Over the course of the year, I’ve gone through a few phases with the game that have shown me its strengths and weaknesses. So now, one year later, I’d like to take a closer look.

**Viewed Through a Pinhole**

Eclipse had received quite a bit of acclaim already when I’d first heard of it. But it also carried a hefty price tag. Reviews I heard and read lauded it as a case study in good graphic design. The game designer, sci-fi nerd and 4X lover in me all pined for the game, but limited availability and a $100 price tag kept it at arm’s length.

Cut to my birthday, I get a heavy box from my parents – the last people I would expect to get this board game for me. But sure enough, there it was, in my possession.

**Supermassive Black Hole**

After my first play, I realized the 800+ components are probably the game’s biggest weakness. The sheer physical complexity is daunting; even a 2-player game requires you to work with more than 400 components on the board. My first game was a 3-player game and took close to an hour just to set up. Since then, I’ve purchased a Plano box for all common tiles and individually bagged each player’s pieces. Even in the best circumstances, though, the game takes time to get to the table.

Play was remarkably accessible in comparison. Teaching the 6 actions of each turn is relatively quick. Combat is best saved for the end, or even a couple turns in, when it looks imminent. I remain dubious about the game’s half-hour-per-player time, but we all loved it. To quote my friend, “This is what $100 for a game gets you.”

Once you get into the alien races, you see how luck can affect the game – and it definitely has more of an impact on the alien races. With the Terrans, you can adapt to what your dealt. With the aliens, however, you either get the resources you need and thrive, or you don’t and have to scramble. 

**Solo Eclipse**

At the end of April, the iPad version of Eclipse was released by Big Daddy’s Creations. The user interface was sleek, futuristic, and made excellent use of the iPad functionality. Whenever I played it, I truly felt like I might be controlling a futuristic empire from my datapad, a la Emanuel Zorg in the Fifth Element.

However, the ease of playing, finishing and restarting Eclipse with my iPad did reveal another weakness. At least with AI, there’s a definite pattern of actions, especially in the early game. With that said, there are still many alien races I have yet to master. But it was a rough edge on an otherwise spotless game.

**The Expansion and Inevitable Heat Death of the Galaxy**

Since I got Eclipse, there have been multiple microexpansions and one hefty expansion (Rise of the Ancients). I picked up one of the former (Supernova), though I have yet to play with the new sector tiles. Surprisingly, I don’t know if I will pick up the larger expansion. I don’t get the game to the table enough to need the variety yet.

The highlight of the game is probably the ship customization. I’ve had ships bristling with missiles, glass cannons with the deadliest lasers and most accurate computers, and immobile* hulks overladen with hull just to survive an enemy barrage. Every part you add sends a message to your opponents.

A note on the graphic design: it lives up to the hype. Every component in the game carries valuable information based on where it is or isn’t, and it’s a testament to the game that you can figure out 90% of what you need to know without reading a single word.

**Out of its Shadow**

In conclusion, Eclipse is a very heavy game, but one that’s been balanced well. Luck can throw that balance, especially for the aliens, but by the time you’re playing with aliens, you should be able to adapt. In addition, there are a few strategies that can seem automatic, but the randomness of technology curbs these – so the luck is both a blessing and a curse, as luck should be.

This game has become one of the standards by which I compare my own designs. If you have a budget for a big game, and your gaming group enjoys 4X and sci-fi, Eclipse is a perfect choice.

tl;dr: Lots to set-up, some luck, but the simple playstyle, variety of options and ship customization make Eclipse well worth it. And if you have an iPad, buy the app.

1365771565.0	1c7bih	First Impressions: Android (not Netrunner)	sigma83	96	22	91	"Hi guys.

With all the (deserved) love for Netrunner recently I was interested in checking out the original game that started off the universe: ***Android***, a 2008 release by Kevin Wilson.

Immediately I realized I was looking at a very divisive game; half the reviews slagged it for being not what they were expecting, long, complicated, and vicious, while the other half hailed it as original, misunderstood, and an amazing game.

Nevertheless, I was intrigued by the notion of playing in that universe and the fact that the game was apparently story-driven (which was the divisive element). I personally love storytelling in games (I own zero euros), so after reading every review on BGG and every video that existed on youtube, I decided that this game was probably up my alley and was in stock at my FLGS for far cheaper than I had anticipated. I was expecting it to cost 80 US$, but I managed to pick it up for 60.

For reference, in my part of the planet Eclipse costs 105 dollars, and Descent 90.

Anyway, the game arrived on Wednesday and I've managed to have a 2 player game of it. First impressions, away!

***THE GAME***

Android, for the unfamiliar, is a cyberpunk detective movie generator. Each player directs a detective, each with their own foibles, strengths, and unique game mechanics, and they are in charge of navigating the game's gauntlet of the detective's personal stories, a tangled conspiracy, and, if there's still time, the actual murder.

Time is key. Each turn sees you with a limited number of very simple actions. The game is not complicated because of its rules - there are only 7 available actions - like most thematic games it is complex because of the repercussions of your actions. Is it worth spending the entire day travelling to the moon to follow the evidence trail? Or would your time be better spent around the spires of New Angeles, uncovering corporate conspiracy? Or perhaps spending time with your wife?

Yes, ladies and gentlemen. In this game, you can get VPs for making time to have dinner with the Mrs.

***Does Android Dream of Electric Sheep?***

I could talk about the various unique-ities of the game; the movement system, where detectives must travel in their 'cars', sets of calipers that you have to touch to two points in order to shuttle between them.

Or the clever evidence mechanic: where following leads finds your detective attempting to contextualize said findings. A bullet in an alleyway may damn a suspect or exonerate him, depending on the biases of the investigator in question. There's a big reason the actual murderer is not sealed in an envelope at the beginning a la Cluedo; in Android, you have Hunches, and proving your Hunches right is worth VP.

Nor am I going to discuss the jigsaw puzzle pieces of the conspiracy, where extra VP can be finagled by forgoing chasing the case to play a demented version of Pipe Dream.

Instead I'm going to talk about, IMO, the game's strongest ideas: The Twilight Cards, and your Plot.

***Twilight and Shifting***

Each detective has two decks of cards specific to him/her: A Light Deck, which s/he can draw from at will, and a Dark Deck, which the OTHER players draw from.

In order to play your Light Cards (which are always good), your detective has to be in a sunny spot in life. All nice and happy at the moment? Cool, you can go have coffee with your friend, or get some new implants installed. However, doing so will shift your Twilight resource to the dark side, and it becomes significantly more difficult to play Light Cards when your Twilight is shifted to the dark.

How do you shift it back to the light? You play other player's Dark Cards on them.

Dark Cards are never nice. In effect, you are screwing with the other players constantly, in order to benefit yourself. This is thematic because Dark Cards only ever happen to you during your turn, and it simulates real life getting in the way of your investigation. Car breakdowns, fights, side gigs that have to be dealt with, demands from your father. These obstacles present the core of Android’s conflict, and prevent it from being Cluedo in Space.

***Plots***

Every few days of in game time, your detective has to resolve a personal plotline. Failure to do so results in negative VPs, but successfully navigating your personal foibles (which the OTHER players can potentially interact with, causing bad baggage to be placed on your plot) can result in a significant VP boost.

Together, the Plot and Twilight Cards, with their abundance of well written flavor text, really help to sell and flesh the world of Android. Emotional, funny, and never boring, the writing is an integral part of the story experience. My brother and I were alternately laughing at the cyborg’s confused attempts to paint flames on his hovercycle to ‘increase the top speed’ and sympathizing with the bounty hunter’s painful relationship with her father.

Yes, I know. Writing. In a board game.

***Oh yeah, the stiff.***

Yeah, there's a murder too. If your Hunches are proven right, VP. If not, no VP. Did I mention you can have hits placed on the suspects you think your fellow players are Hunched towards?

***Short Circuits***

AKA, the downsides.

Android can be vicious. You spend a ton of time chasing the trail, only to find the suspect dead. You can do everything right with your wife, but she leaves anyway, because of baggage placed by other players.

But that's okay, because it's a detective movie generator. Imagine how cool the plot for that film would be, once you've finished the game.

And it's not like you have no recourse; there are multiple ways to gain VP, and solving the murder does not instantly guarantee a win. Android is primarily a game about managing your resources and knowing how to balance each of your goals. Overfocusing on the case to the detriment of your personal life is a great way to have the rug swept out from under you.

The game can be long, yes, but is it ever satisfying. And the journey is completely unlike any other board game. There is no combat mechanic, no dice rolling, no counting tiles. Just decisions, and the consequences of those decisions, and a burning desire to see your detective happy, or if not happy, successful.

And the final, most vociferous complaint: What kind of murder mystery has your detectives killing off suspects?!?!?! Planting evidence??? How is that in any way thematic?!?!

I completely agree; if this were a murder mystery game. It's not. It is a detective movie generator. Viewed from that perspective, the various wrenches thrown in by real life, by NPCs, by the suspects themselves, all writhe and coil about each other to form an intricate web of story that you and the four other players at the table get to experience together. I broke with my normal habit and abstained from reading any cards that I did not actually play, wanting to squeeze every last drop of surprise and genuine glee from the cards, so dripping are they with detail and love.

***Closing Arguments***

Android is beautiful. It's a tightly interlocking piece of genius. I have never played a game like it. I have never *heard* of a game like it. I wanted to bring it to your attention because I feel, with all the Netrunner love, there's some of you who might really love Android, and I wanted to share this heavy box full of elegance and love with all of you. Thank you for reading this far.

I rated the first playthrough (2 players, 3 hours, only 3 references to the rulebook, final score 39-38 VPs) extremely highly, and the game has been burning a hole in my brain ever since. The world of Android sticks with you, the threads of story your detectives carve through that city weave their way into your dreams. I am getting a 5 player game in soon, and I fully expect my friends to absolutely love it.

And one tiny, final nitpick, as a writer:

Familiar with Doom and Descent's somewhat flim-flam writing in the scenario books, I was pleasantly surprised to discover the quality of the text in this game significantly improved. However, it is not *quite* up to the standard of, say, a prose novel. I do hope, however, that more game designers do follow this trend of having well-written flavor text and seriously invest in hiring proper writers.

Unique assembly of mechanics, engaging storylines that are never the same twice, gorgeous artwork, complex, diabolical, beautiful. Android, 2008, Fantasy Flight Games. Designer: Kevin Wilson. 9/10.

1361373831.0	18w0rl	Last Night, I just experienced the most Epic game of Arkham Horror that I ever played. SO Epic, I can honestly say I will never play a better session of AH for as long as I live.	Davey_Jones	95	23	64	"I'll try not to hit a huge wall of text at you, but here goes...

Me and my bro were bored last night and I was organizing my games. We end up deciding to play AH after watching a review of Mansions of Madness from TheDiceTower. We get in a HP Lovecraft mood.

We set it up, turn on fitting music, and choose The Photographer and The Doctor. Yig was chosen at random and the game begins. 

With Yig chosen, we had to learn to use our Sneak ability more often as defeating Cultist added a Doom Token to yig, which was a much different approach than we were use to. It didn't take long for things to go bad and 5 Doom Token went on Yig in no time. After a while of running around collecting clues and raising the threat level something good we finally find our stride and seal the first gate. The small victory was shadowed however by two Rumors on the board. One added a Doom Token to Yig if we rolled a 1 or a 2 during Mythos phase unless we discarded an Ally downtown, the other would force us to pull two Mythos cards for the rest of the game unless we discard 3 spells on French Hill. I quickly sacrifices Thomas my Ally, but we didnt stop the other Rumor in time. We now pull two Mythos cards, but only open a gate with the second. Things just went from bad to worse. We continue to gain momentum, but with two mythos cards being drawn up, the threat level is rising almost every two to three turns. Aliies are dropping like leaves in the fall and the shoppes are closing fast. We reach a Threat of 6 and the Maniacs, who were the easiest to kill, are now some of the deadliest. Luck was with us though as after we reach this point an Environmental card was drawn preventing the threat from rising and I gain the Dread Curse of Azathoth (A very handy spell to have). We close 4 gates. I have 5 clues and an Elder Sign. We are on the home stretch, But due to a Mythos card that was pulled that shuffled the deck, we got the Rumor card again that caused a Doom Token to be added on a roll of 1 or 2. Mixed with a gate opening in a new location and it makes a recipe for an Ancient Awakening.

Now here's the stuff legends are made of...

Yig curses at the start of battle. I end up cursed, but lucky my brother was blessed right before so now he's back to normal. After the first successful dodge of Yig's attack, it was obvious very quickly that without a weapon in my hand I was a dead man walking. My first roll used up all my clue tokens with the last reroll finally rolling a 6. (Mind you very epic music is playing in the background). Luckily my Bro reminds me to roll for my curse during the next upkeep. I do and I roll a 1. Holy Shit! I knew what I had to do. I passed a spell check to use Dread Curse of Azathoth, i lost all remaining Sanity points and attack him for 3. My self sacrificing bravery echoes into the abyss I am devoured into. Now it's just my bro in the face of a God. My bro continues his attack, Axe in hand getting his life down to one Doom Token. He blocks an attack with a Wayward Statue and rolls 5 dice with NO SUCCESSES! How can this be possible! The next attack he tries to defend against with only two dice and fails. He now has one life and one sanity left. The next attack it death for sure. The music reaches the height of its track. My brother shakes his 5 dice in his hand. I start cheering him on. ""You can do this"" ""It's all you dude"" ""You can save Arkham, I believe in you!""

 He rolls. 

Every single dice is a failure.....

...EXCEPT ONE! Yig is sent back to the deep abyss from whence he came, Arkham is saves. MUSIC ENDS. We wake the whole fucking house up screaming our victory to the world! I start laughing with triumph, we can't believe we actually did it. EVERY SINGLE DICE COUNTED in that battle. I Love this fucking game and most definitely will be playing it again tonight. These are the memories we play for. This is the joy boardgames can bring to a group of the willing. Holy. Shit.

I started with the wonderful generators available on BGG, but something was missing.  I really wanted to see a 'Red Dwarf - Holly' style talking head voicing the mission to me just like the computers on my favorite sci-fi shows.  So I started creating this little application and I'd love to see any of you other Space Alert fans get some joy out of it too.

So we decide to go again.  She's a spy again, of course only she knows this.  The game goes on for a bit.  First round, resistance.  Second round, spies.  Cue the third round.  

People are beginning to suspect she may be a spy.  In a show of mock exasperation, she lays her head on the table saying something along the lines of ""Oh, come on, I'm obviously a good guy.""  As she's saying this she raises her head back off the table.  Unknown to her, she has laid her head on her role card...and it's stuck to her forehead.  There's a gasp at the table.
