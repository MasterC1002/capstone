1358788209.0	16zw0k	I would like to say one thing: KDE 4.10 is amazing!	Deusdies	85	8	42	"Most of you probably have not upgraded because, well, it has not been released yet. I use Arch and there's the kde-unstable repo which has 4.9.98 in it. 

I will say one thing: for the first time ever, I find that KDE finally feels polished. Don't get me wrong, I've used KDE for the past ~4 years, however, there were always things that bothered me, some irks etc. Notification center being one of them, calendar not displaying properly, KWin (animations) slowing down after some time during the day, etc.

Not anymore. The Notifications have been reworked to offer a smooth experience. Dolphin has beautiful animations all over it. There's even a maximize/restore window animation. The KWin no longer slows down, here, even 4 days after use. 

Not only that, but the applications have greatly improved as well. Earlier I could not even start KMail, but now I use the entirety of the Kontact suite - it seamlessly integrates with my GMail, my Google Contacts, and my Google Calendar. 

No longer is the fact that some KDE thing randomly just does not work - all of the sudden. The entire desktop experience is fantastic.

Good job, KDE e.V. team!"	t5_2qh6i	True

Features being worked on for this next major bi-annual KDE Software Compilation update include:

- A KIO-Slave for MTP, the Media Transfer Protocol. MTP is a Microsoft specification for transferring of files to audio/media players and other mobile devices. The KIO access work for MTP support is a work in progress and will allow for things like accessing a Galaxy Nexus and other MTP-enabled smart-phones from the Dolphin file manager without having to resort to other means for the MTP support under Linux.

- A new QML-based screen-locker for ksmserver, the KDE Session Manager.

- Porting notifications and task manager applets along with Kickoff to QML.

- A new print manager KCM and Plasmoid replacement in C++.

- Various new plug-ins, features, and a plotting framework when it comes to the KDE educational packages.

- A major clean-up and rewrite of the KDE games library.

- Porting libkipi of the KDE graphics stack to KDE-XML GUI.

- Juk is finally being moved away from kde3support.

- Facebook support for the KDE PIM will now be supported by default.

- A QML version of the Microblog KDE Plasma add-on.

- Various Okteta enhancements in the KDE SDK area.

- Proper AMD Catalyst driver support in KWin.

So I decided to write a quick KDE tutorial. If anyone has any suggestions, please feel free to add it in the comments and chances are I'll put your suggestion into the guide (with proper attribution, of course).

I'll include a lot of screenshots, so I'd suggest that anyone reading to use [this bookmarklet](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/related/aq8ak/bookmarklet_to_show_all_images_on_a_reddit/) to show the screenshots on this page. (If you don't want to keep the bookmarklet permanently, you can just copy/paste the javascript from that page into the address bar on this page - though I'm sure just about everyone reading this knows that already.)

*****

The first thing you need to do when getting started with KDE is choose your distro. This is just like choosing a Linux distro, and if you're moving from another desktop on Linux/Unix/BSD, you should probably stick with a distro very similar to what you're already using. Of course, this is also as good a time as any to try out a new distro. It's all up to you! Some of the most popular options are:

* [Kubuntu](http://www.kubuntu.org/) - [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/)'s KDE-based little brother. If you're already familiar with the inner workings of Ubuntu, Kubuntu is probably a good place to start. The Kubuntu developers try to keep the KDE installation as vanilla as possible, so what you'll see when you install Kubuntu is very close to default KDE.
* [Linux Mint](http://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=1676), the most popular Ubuntu offshoot, has a KDE version as well.
* [Arch Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/KDE) is perhaps more daunting for first-time users, but is a very good way to go if you want to learn a lot about Linux, too. Like Kubuntu, Arch makes very few modifications to their KDE packages before including them.
* [The Chakra Project](http://chakra-project.org/) is a KDE-focused offshoot of Arch designed to be more appropriate for first-time users. It is under active development, so I only recommend it for people who like to tinker a lot.

There are [many other options available](http://www.kde.org/download/distributions.php) as well. I have chosen Kubuntu for this tutorial because I happened to have a Kubuntu DVD on my desk at the time I started.

Of course, you may be tempted to install KDE through your distribution, and if you're just trying it out, that's a perfectly reasonable path to choose. Please be aware, however, that doing so may not get you the experience intended by the KDE team or the KDE packagers of your distribution (for example, in Ubuntu you may still use GDM as the login manager, while KDE has its own KDM login manager, which is used out of the box in Kubuntu).

*****

On your first KDE login, the desktop will [look like this](http://i.imgur.com/EcSAn.png).

Some say this reminds them of Windows. This may help new users of KDE, but naturally it also allows for criticism. Just like Windows, there's a menu available in the [bottom-left corner](http://i.imgur.com/Gc2zJ.png).

Perhaps more interesting, however, is the [top-right corner](http://i.imgur.com/fyIPE.png). 

This menu allows you to change your desktop settings, add and manage activities (a uniquely-KDE feature as far as I know) and manage the widgets on your desktop. Clicking the ""Add Widgets"" button will reveal a widget selection box at [just above your bottom panel](http://i.imgur.com/fQKsH.png).

Clicking and dragging a widget somewhere on your desktop will place that widget right under your mouse. But the widgets you see on your desktop aren't the only widgets available to you. The ""Get New Widgets..."" button will allow you to install new widgets from a file or to browse new widgets which you can [download and install with one click](http://i.imgur.com/rIjdz.png). The widgets will then appear in the widget selection window the next time you open it.

The next cool feature of KDE is activities. Do you remember virtual desktops? Well Activities are like virtual desktops for the 21st century. From the cashew in the top-right corner, you can open the [Activities dialogue](http://i.imgur.com/BYIyv.png) (you can also use Meta-Q [meta is the Windows key on most keyboards, or the Command key on Apple keyboards]). Each activity will have its own desktop widgets (although you can also set each virtual desktop on an activity to have its own widgets as well).

From the Activities window, you can rename (or set icons for) your activities; add, start, stop or delete activities; switch activities or manage the widgets on the current activity. On my personal machine, I have an activity for gaming and multimedia, one for getting work done and one for other stuff (including web browsing). Amarok automatically starts when I open the multimedia activity, and the widgets there are designed for quick access to what I need for multimedia (including the Nvidia X Server Settings and an icon that makes the KMix window appear, letting me move VLC's sound from my internal card to the audio channel on my HDMI connection).

The best part is, when you stop an activity it will pause everything happening on that activity, ready to reappear the next time you start it!

*****

KDE has always been famous (or perhaps infamous) for [its configurability](http://i.imgur.com/LS4F9.png).

The System Settings window gives you access to just about every system configuration option in KDE, from Account Details to Workspace Behaviour. This is also where you can enable or disable certain features of KDE. For example, the Desktop Effects option allows you to enable or disable certain functions of how KDE looks - from useful accessibility features like desktop magnification and mouse tracking to fun and perhaps silly features like making closed windows explode or making windows wobble when you move them.

*****

One of the features of KDE that not many people seem to use yet is Nepomuk. It is a Semantic Desktop structure, allowing you to tag your files, easily filter them and do many other things, all with the goal of making your file management easier. However, if your computer has very limited resources and you don't use these features, the ""Desktop Search"" icon under ""Workspace Appearance and Behavior"" allows you to disable Nepomuk.

Alternatively, that same icon allows you to enable Strigi desktop search (disabled by default). Strigi is like Google Desktop, Beagle, or Spotlight on Mac OS X. Enabling Strigi will improve Nepomuk's information about the files included. [More information](http://thomasmcguire.wordpress.com/2009/10/03/akonadi-nepomuk-and-strigi-explained/) is available from people much more knowledgeable about the technology than I am.

*****

Global keyboard shortcuts are very convenient. Many of the most common ones are set up by default (volume control buttons on most laptop keyboards will change the volume in KDE, for example), but I like to change some of them. For example, KRunner (the ""Run Command"" interface that you get after pressing Alt-F2). I find Alt-Space more convenient (I use krunner VERY often), so on my own computer I've changed the shortcut to Alt-Space. The ""Shortcuts and Gestures"" icon in the top-right of the main System Settings window (you can get there from the Desktop Search interface by pressing the ""Overview"" button in the top-left corner of the window) has a ""Global Keyboard Shortcuts"" section. Choosing ""Run Command Interface"" from the ""KDE Component:"" dropdown box lets one change the already-set shortcuts and let some other shortcuts. Sometimes, browsing the global keyboard shortcuts itself is handy. For example, I discovered today that pressing Ctrl-Alt-L will (by default) lock my session.

*****

My personal suggestion to anyone using KDE is ""right-click everything!"" You'll discover enormous functionality by doing so. For example, all of my work for classes is in a very inconvenient location (under Documents/College/Classes/[Semester]), but each semester I change one of the Places (open Dolphin [file manager] - the left-hand bar) to be that semester's classes, making all of my school work very convenient to access. I found this out by right-clicking a folder in Dolphin one day and seeing the ""Add to Places"" option.

If you have the option between two pieces of software - one built into KDE and one not, I would always suggest trying the KDE version if you're using KDE. KDE apps have a level of integration with the desktop that I didn't even see when I used Mac OS X. The KRunner interface (Alt-F2 by default, but it's also built into the K menu [Search bar at the top]) will help you find the next song in Amarok, find people to talk to in Kopete, search for contacts in your KDE address book, and communicate with many other KDE applications.

Applications look great (even GTK+ with help from gtk-chtheme and oxygen-molecule). KWIN effects are astonishing. KDE has *a lot* of features (I couldn't find a simple good program to do wallpaper slideshow on gnome). Oh, did I mention it was beautiful?

Thank you, KDE team! I just wish more people were using KDE (i.e. that people would forget KDE4.0 faster)

For the past few months, due to my realization that most of the tools that I used on a daily basis were KDE/QT programs, I've since switched to KDE full time and couldn't be happier.  Oh, I don't think I'd be happy coding without KATE, burning disks without K3B and math without QToctave.  

But I digress.  Most, if not all, of of my friends/acquaintances who use some flavor of linux, mock my use of KDE, calling it too windows-like (look can be changed) or not efficient (speed or user-friendiness, pick one), or not stable(maybe true about early KDE4, or 3.x, but 4.3 has been rock solid for me), while  using DEs like gnome or wms like xmonad.  

I love that free software gives everyone the choice to pick what suits them the best; but what has KDE done to gain this bad reputation?

---
**Why is Gnome the default on most Linux distributions?**

Back in 1996/97 when KDE was started, Qt was really the best toolkit available. Probably still is, on *any* platform. But, it wasn't Open Source, it was ""free of charge for non-commercial use."" Not being terribly concerned with that, KDE rolled with it.

Stallman and people who maintained Debian pointed out that because KDE itself was GPL and Qt was proprietary, merely compiling and linking KDE may not be legal. Debian didn't even ship KDE, [explaining](http://www.debian.org/News/1998/19981008):

&gt; The corollary of this is that if you link the GPLed KDE code against Troll Tech's Qt library, and distribute it, you must distribute it under the GPL.

&gt; However, the GPL insists that you grant the right to modify the complete source of a program distributed under its terms, which is clearly in conflict with Qt's licence conditions.

&gt; ...

&gt; So, we have been denied the right to distribute the Program at all.

 Even if KDE were BSD licensed, Debian still wouldn't have shipped Qt, which was entirely proprietary.

That whole fiasco was the [original reason Gnome was even created](http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/usenix98/freenix/icaza.ps); Gnome was to be the actually free alternative to KDE. Early on, it was definitely nowhere near as good as KDE, but where we no legal issues. Debian shipped with Gnome.

Three years later, TrollTech, the company behind Qt at the time, [GPL'd Qt](http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/reports/2269/1). For them it was a perfect compromise: The only way to use the GPL license was to Open Source your own code, and since commercial developers were unlikely to want to do that, they could buy another license for Qt. So TrollTech had a GPL version for the Free Software people, and proprietary licenses available for everyone else. Today that same model is used by Java, MySQL, and others.

But that left Red Hat with a quandary: Red Hat's brass didn't want proprietary developers passing on Red Hat Linux because Qt required them to either pay for a license or Open Source their project. Red Hat needed to be licensed such that anyone could develop for it free of charge, even if the software they were making was proprietary. Red Hat would continue to ship Gnome. Debian had already made it the default. Only SUSE shipped with KDE.

[Nine years later](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2009/01/nokia-qt-lgpl-switch-huge-win-for-cross-platform-development/), Qt was re-licensed again by Nokia to LGPL, forever resolving any licensing concerns. But at this point, I think the damage had been done. Gnome has become the default on all distros but OpenSuse. Canonical had already decided to chart its own waters with Unity.

Which leads us to where we are. Red Hat and Debian ship Gnome. Ubuntu ships with Unity. OpenSuse ships with KDE.

That's my recollection anyway."	t5_2qh6i	True

I'm thinking of Gentoo. Are there others that are even more quick to accept new upstream versions?

I've been using Debian for years, but it seems like there are lengthy delays before packages make their way into testing. Some of that, I'm sure, is due to legitimate bugs; but I suspect that a lot of it is due to them needing to change things that aren't quite free enough or don't conform to their vision of how things must be done. Other than the delays, I'm quite happy where I am... but the delays can be quite frustrating.

Several times I've found a major bug in a ""new"" package version, only to find out after writing up a lengthy bug report that the bug had been fixed months earlier - in a version that hadn't yet made it into Testing.

Early on, that was Netscape or Mozilla. Later on, it was Firefox. Now it seems to be standard that either Firefox or Chrome (or Chromium) gets used on everyone's KDE desktops. 

None of these browsers really aim for KDE integration, however. If you want KDE integration, you need to use Konqueror or rekonq, but this isn't without its own drawbacks (lower Javascript performance, few, if any, add-ons, etc.).

So I'd like to know: What web browser do you use (and why), and what (if any) steps do you take to make it feel more like the rest of your system?"	t5_2qh6i	True

This port is different than the previous X-windows based ports.  It uses the Aqua interface, and the normal mac menu bar.

This  port is not perfect.  For example, konqueror shows some blank space where it would have the menu bar on another operating system.

Overall, though I am pleased with it being perfectly usable.   I think this bodes well for the future of kde, because in addition to Linux, it now supports OSX and Windows.  With continued improvements I am sure this will attract many more users.

1360071029.0	17xj17	Homerun, KScreen, Web Accounts, Workflow: The Icing on the 4.10 Cake	mikevaughn	25	4	16	"I've been a die-hard KDE user for a little over 6 years, and after using the 4.10 release candidates for about a month now, I feel confident in saying it's by far the best release yet (given the relatively few regressions I've come across so far and the relatively large number of bug-fixes/new features/performance and stability improvements). While I'm happy to see such a big focus on polish with this release, as opposed to adding new features, I can't help but think the exclusion of the projects listed in the thread title was a bit of a missed opportunity. For those that are unfamiliar with any of them:

* [Homerun](http://userbase.kde.org/Homerun): KDE's extremely customizable fullscreen launcher, which more or less solves every complaint I've seen against Unity's Dash. (I'm not suggesting that it should have been made the default launcher, just that it would have been nice to see it included as an option.)
* [KScreen](http://www.afiestas.org/kscreen-0-1-alpha-released/): I'm sure frequenters of this subreddit are already familiar with this, but in short, it brings KDE's management of multiple monitors into the 21st century.
* [Web Accounts](http://www.afiestas.org/webaccounts-making-socialcloud-easier/): Enter the credentials for your Facebook/Google accounts *one time*, and it will apply them to KDE's PIM applications (e-mail, contacts, calendar) and instant messaging.
* [Workflow](http://opentoolsandspace.org/en/projects/development/plasmoid-workflow): The first Plasma widget that really nails the concept of Activities. There are a couple things holding it back (it uses its own theme rather than the Plasma theme, so it sticks out like a sore thumb, plus it currently makes it impossible to set a window as visible on one virtual desktop across all Activities), but nothing that couldn't have been hammered out if it was more of a priority. And given how much the KDE team has been pushing the concept of Activities since their inception, it really seems like it would have been.

Again, I want to re-state that I respect the KDE team's decisions, and given the above projects are so new, it's understandable that they weren't included. It's just that a part of me can't help but think, ""Well I've been using them for months [mostly] without issue, so what's the problem?""

Did I miss anything? Which KDE projects have you seen reach a usable level of maturity over the past six months that you think should have been included in the 4.10 release?"	t5_2qh6i	True

There are quite a few things where a status panel would be quite useful. What are the techniques people use to make desktop plasmoids readily visible?

Edit: Thanks for all the replies. It looks like the dashboard is the preferred way of doing things. Is there any way of creating a sort of corral for useful indicators so that I can get on with my work (which usually involves a maimised window or two) but still be able to glance at what's going on without having to constantly call up the dashboard?"	t5_2qh6i	True

Qt apps

If I go outside of KDE I prefer to go with Qt apps.  The ones I use are

VLC -- SMPlayer is really good, but I've used VLC for years and it's rock solid

Speedcrunch -- best calculator there is for quick arithmetic 

Transmission-qt -- it's lighter than KTorrent and does all that I need

GTK

Geany -- I could use Kate for everything I need, but Geany never did anything to me and it is a really good IDE

Pidgin -- it's a great program, uses far less memory than Kopete and has working system tray notifications

Deadbeef -- I wish Juk was better, because Amarok is overkill for just listening to mp3s, also has great system tray (and icon-only plasmoid widget) integration

Viewnior -- Gwenview is nice but like Deadbeef, Viewnior does the one thing I need (look at pictures) really well

Leafpad -- Once again I could probably use KWrite for editing config files, but Leafpad is just so dead simple I can't stop using it

Chromium -- I kind of dislike all current web browsers, this is just the best of a bad situation

LibreOffice -- I have Calligra installed as well, and will be keeping an eye on it, but right now Libre is better

Inkscape/GIMP -- just flat out better than the KDE alternatives

PDF Mod -- Okular is the best PDF reader on the planet, but for the rare occasion that I need to delete and add pages into a pdf, PDF Mod is pretty fantastic"	t5_2qh6i	True

Now I decided to test out KDE again and the progress made is huge. I find it to be very fast and stable in the past week that I have been using it.
My question to you guys is how do you have your desktop setup? Did you just leave it the default way or have you really customized it? I feel like I want to change things around from the defauly look but I am not sure of how I'd like to do that. Do you know of any blogs that are constantly showing new features and plasma widgets that can be useful? Is there any special software that I should try out?
I feel like KDE is very rarely mentioned or talked about compared to unity/GNOME and I do not understand why.

I work in a small research company. In office, everyone uses Fedora as desktop OS. Since GNOME is a default DE, most people use it. I am no expert/veteran in Linux, KDE, GNOME. I started using KDE, loved it and its community. So nothing against GNOME or anything like that.

**Incident:**

Yesterday, we had presentation in company where one of our bosses was going to talk. He connected his laptop (also with Fedora/GNOME) to projector and tried configuring projector using the 'xrandr'. After trying for few minutes, he was frustrated, by now crowd was also getting restless. I offered him help. Initially he was reluctant to try KDE because of not knowing what it is but he gave up at sometime and I handed the laptop to me. In next couple of minutes slides were on screen, thanks to 'krandr'. 

**After effect:**

After presentation, he asked me for details about KDE. I told him about plasma-widgets, dolphin browser and Kate. He was mighty impressed with all the things and told me he is going to use KDE now onwards. 

**A Question:**

I keep introducing people near me to KDE. Most often the first question they ask is, what is Desktop Environment? How to explain this in least technical manner? 

TL;DR Boss switched to KDE since it rescued him during a presentation.

As I said in the title, I've been running KDE happily for a year or even more now (don't care to remember). But recently, maybe a couple-three months back, things started to slow down significantly. And I mean, significantly.

I have an Intel Core i5 CPU running at 2.6 Ghz, and 8 Gb of RAM, and I don't believe I run applications heavier than Chromium. Although I confess Chromium has maybe 40 extensions and a lot of them run in the background.

Right now, when I boot up and get past the login screen, it takes me a good FIVE minutes to get Chromium up and running.

I just don't understand what happened that has made my PC so slow of all of (not so) sudden? 

I do have a few other WM installed, like Gnome, Ubuntu, or XFCE, but that should not have a bearing on productivity as long as I don't run them all at the same time? 

Right now things are so slow I'm thinking of wiping the whole thing and installing LinuxMint, only thing that prevents me from doing that is I'm not sure that will improve performance.

Does anyone have any clue as to what might have been causing this slowdown? 

If that helps, as I type this message I'm showing 7868 MiB of Memory total, out of which 68% is free memory. Yet if feels very slow to even type this message.

Appreciate any insight, thanks for your time."	t5_2qh6i	True

* Rekonq - Better, but still slow, doesn't render pages correctly sometimes, crashes...
* Arora - Same as rekonq

I have now given up, and installed chromium. It's really awesome, except that it looks weird, and I don't want gtk-apps if I can avoid it. Nothing else in my system needs gtk.

No news on any new features to expect or at least an expected date of launch.

      Option        ""TwinView""  ""true""

Your dual monitors will now automagically work (right from the login screen!). Yes, that's the **entire** xorg.conf.

Extra:
I found that you *have* to start with both monitors enabled, but you can add a metamode to disable one after you log in (for people with such set ups). KDE's krandrtray is excellent for that task. Here's the metamode line I use (this goes in the section above).

    Option    ""MetaModes""  ""nvidia-auto-select,nvidia-auto-select;nvidia-auto-select""

Great stuff for any newbie I think.

Just wanted to add that I got to this vid via another post here for a write-up from/about openSUSE.

That's got info on GNOME and KDE. Good stuff.

1361641408.0	1934zy	Copyright Alert System to go in Effect Monday:  How to configure Ktorrent	redsteakraw	21	6	6	"Step 1.  [Get a VPN, service that does not take logs and is located in a country where non comercial file sharing is legal of no action is taken. ( Switzerland, Sweeden)](http://torrentfreak.com/which-vpn-providers-really-take-anonymity-seriously-111007/)

Step 2. Set up the VPN to be a Tap device,  the VPN service should register as tap0 or something like that.


Step 3.  Enable IP filter plugin, by clicking on plugin on the top bar then check the ip filter.  Go to the settings and select the IP filter section.  Check use PeerGaurdian and then click the download and convert button.

**IMPORTAINT**
Step 4.  Go to the Network settings in Ktorrent, In the Network Interface dropdown box select the tap device.  This is importaint as you don't want any traffic on you non VPN connection, if your VPN goes down for whatever reason and this is not setup your traffic would be routed through your regular internet connection.  With this selected the program will only use your VPN connection.  

Step 5.  Tweak Ktorrent for more peers, in the Network settings click the Use UTP and also set it as your main protocol.  Now go to the BitTorrent section in the settings, and make sure DHT,  Peer Exchange, Webseeds and Check data when download is finished.

You now should have a configured, more private Bittorrent client.  Feedback is welcomed and feel free to comment below. "	t5_2qh6i	True
1361380389.0	18w8cv	Group two apps under a single window?	ItsNotRocketSurgery	16	1	14	One of the things I really like about KDE is the window rules system. Everything goes where I want, remembers it's size and position, etc. It's great. I do have one thing that I'd like to be able to do that I haven't figured out yet. I'm not sure it's even possible, but I figured I would see if you guys have any tricks up your sleeves. I have two separate applications that I use together (editor and viewer) and I'd like them to appear as if they were a single application. Ideally, they would open up under a parent window and appear tiled next to each. kwin already has the ability to do something similar in its autogroup feature. Currently, I can get the two applications to appear under the same window, but they're tabbed and I need to be able to see them simultaneously. The other challenge is multiple instances. I open one editor and one viewer for each document, and I need the editor to be grouped with the corresponding viewer. In theory this could be done with regular expressions on the window title of each application. Is this possible with kwin?	t5_2qh6i	True

Been a few years since I tried KDE, I always found it cumbersome, with far to many options but I must say it is now a fresh reprieve from the 'this is just the way it is' approach that seems to have taken over other desktops.

I just a have a few issues/questions that I hope people could help me with. 
I am finding dolphin a little basic for my day to day needs and I find it a bit odd at time. I liked the ability to have all my persistent sftp connections, ftp connections and samba shares listed like folders down the left. What is the best way to get similar features in dolphin or is it possible?

Also, I may be mad here, but I had a file view window open earlier where it showed a little bar under the selected device showing how much space I had left. I cannot seem to find this option again.

I am trying digikam as a replacement for shotwell and since I have opened it, it is constantly faded on the taskbar with a red line under it. Here is a screen shot of the red line, this time when I opened Kdenlive [Here](http://i.imgur.com/hlbgO.png). The application works ok but responds slowly so I am presuming it has something to do with that. My google search efforts have yielded nothing, too many red hat results.  

I have found some serious time saving apps on here already, yakuake being one of my favouries but is there anything anyone else can recommend.

What are good simple video editors, I used to just edit videos of the kids on the wifes mint machine using Pitivi but is there anything more native anyone can recommend?

System Settings &gt; Workspace Appearance &gt; Window Decorations &gt; Configure Decoration... &gt; Window-Specific Overrides &gt; Add

Then you can either add a Windows Class Name or a Window Title with the regular expression being a period: .

Because that matches all characters, any decoration options you choose here will apply to all windows. I used ""Border size: No Border"" and ""Hide window title bar"", but removing borders hardly makes much difference, so you decide if you want to do that too. Largely cosmetic, really."	t5_2qh6i	True

This is actually meant for embedded devices and having Kubuntu on my desktop, I had the packages in the backports repository. I installed them and replaced kwin. Immediately saw an improvement!

If you are a developer you could have an app Icon or a dev icon.  This would mainly be a visual cue of where kredditors are coming from and add to the eyecandy of kreddit.  This is currently in the planning stages only.  I need to know from you firstly if you even want it, and secondly any ideas on how you want it implemented with suggestions.  Check out the links first to see how it looks on the other subreddits.

1275392061.0	ca79x	Why is nobody interested in a fast, fully functional KDE with unused modules stripped out ?	sandys1	23	11	25	"For sometime now, I have been thinking about KDE with a lot of the not-invented-here modules stripped out.
 With some changes on my desktop, I have managed to bring down the KDE memory consumption (on startup to ~300mb)
My purpose - get KDE to run on a 256 mb memory machine.

For example:
1. Get rid of Konqueror (libkonq is still needed for dolphin)
Install qBittorrent (vs KBittorrent), Chromium (vs Konqueror), Xarchiver (instead of Ark) and Xchat (instead of Quassel/Konversation), Thunderbird(instead of Kmail).
The list of programs is contentious, but they are much more widely used than the KDE equivalents. Also the programs are chosen to be full features, yet not be dependent on Akonadi.
 
2. Replace Kjs with Google V8
3. No Strigi or Nepomuk
4. No Akonadi (or atleast replace MySQL with MongoDB/CouchDB)
5. Replace KHTML (for e.g. used for HTML  thumbnail previews) with QtWebkit
6. Throw away Phonon (it might happen anyway because of http://colin.guthr.ie/2010/05/qt-multimediamobility-vs-phonon-fight/)
Phonon is only used for system sounds. VLC, Skype and Flash do not use Phonon.
7. Throw away printer-applet (python based) and replace it with print-manager (http://dantti.wordpress.com/2010/02/12/print-manager/)

Of all the above wishlist, the one that I find most puzzling is the refusal to adopt Firefox or Chromium over Konqueror. 

I have wanted to build such a distro myself, but all requests for help are met with disdain. Why is this ? 
Why doesnt the KDE community wish to adopt _some_ cool stuff from the GTK camp  and moreover drop others as a lost cause ?

1349702426.0	114woy	Super key to open the application launcher	Mogger	20	7	6	"One common feature request is to open the application launcher in KDE using the Super (""Windows"") key, see e.g. [this forum topic](http://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=83&amp;t=39073). This is however a bit troublesome, since the Super key is a modifier and most people still want to use it for other shortcuts.

I read the discussion in the forums today and thought that the functionality to act as both a modifier and a normal key is similar to [xcape](https://github.com/alols/xcape). Even though I'm not interested in this feature since I don't have an application launcher, I thought ""why not give it a try?""

**TL;DR:** You can now open the application launcher with the Super key and still use it as a modifier. Say hi to [**ksuperkey**](http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=154569)."	t5_2qh6i	True
