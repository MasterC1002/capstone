1353020295.0	139kz8	Just an observation on this subreddit.	jgiraffe	40	2	11	I see a lot of posts on this subreddit with downvotes and upvotes, but with very few (if any comments). If we're going to take the time and listen to a mix and give a vote on it, could we at least let the OP know what we did or didn't like? Giving feedback to each other is a way that we can strengthen this community so we produce better mixes the next time around. 	t5_2qipb	True

I think so. 	elusivepuck	37	2	14	"It is very frustrating to listen to a great mix someone posts, become exposed to some new great tunes, then realize there is no tracklist and are left in the dark until the original poster decides to check his reddit messages again. Sometimes you may never get a response, and that great mix you listened only makes you irritated and upset when you think of it again.

The problem I've been noticing though is none of us want to upvote our competition, leaving the whole thing pretty stagnant. So come over to our little subreddit and listen to some of the absolutely **sick** mixes these redditors have been publishing.

1358216028.0	16lawu	Request for input: Improving /r/mixes	rdosage	24	5	9	"In this message:

* State of the subreddit
* New mod introduction
* New rules
* Request for help
* tl;dr at the end

With almost 4,000 users, a ton of traffic, and a great foundation, /r/mixes can become a great place to share your own mixes or music you've found that inspires you.

However, most of the posts made today have no more than three votes and even less comments. The creator of this subreddit, /u/breakbeat, has done a great job building up the userbase - but has told me that he doesn't have the time to devote to the subreddit that is needed at this time.

So, I've offered to help. Who am I? I've been DJing for over 12 years. Mostly bedroom, but I've opened for DJ Dara and Jen Lasher before. I've spun on vinyl, used controllers, and now use CDJs. 

I see this group as somewhere to share your mixes or to post mixes from others that inspire you. It doesn't just need to be something that you created in your bedroom, post that link to Soundcloud from your favorite DJ here too.

First off, some ideas on rules:

* You must include the style(s) included in the mix
* Don't start your submission saying ""I'm not happy with this, but please listen..."" If this is your first mix and you need help with the basics, go post in /r/Beatmatch. If you don't enjoy it yourself, what makes you think others will?
* Soundcloud and Mixcloud are the best bets for hosting your own mix, but other sites won't automatically deleted

And - here's the big one:

* Don't post asking for reviews/critiques unless you've contributed yourself. If you want someone else to spend an hour or even 30 minutes listening to your music in this community, don't you think you should do the same? 

I don't want this to turn into an echo chamber. Get involved.

To that final point, what other thoughts do you have?

tl;dr:
Don't ask for feedback if you haven't provided it yourself, don't bash your mix in the title"	t5_2qipb	True

These mixes were all encoded at 128 kbps to comply with the free Mediafire account filesize limits but I have 320 kbps encodes available. Also, I have all these mixes cut up for tracked CD burning. If anyone really wants either of these, just drop a comment.

""Download"" leads to the mix at my blog and the download link is a no-hassle Mediafire link. ""Stream"" is hosted at Mixcloud. Both have complete tracklistings and descriptions.

* Start working on the wiki to catalog some of the best mixes from these posts and from other subreddits

* Increase commenting by giving out some type of ""Top Commenter"" flair. If I see someone giving really good feedback, I'll give out custom flair. If you'd like to nominate someone, just message the mods.

* Fuck the downvoters.  You kill content.  This is meant to be an archive, not your iPod.  Upvote what you like and leave alone what you don't.  If we want to use the upvote/vote to rate content, a mix of the month contest would be more apt.

* Get your shit together and force some kind genre tagging.  Without it, searching is a mess, and if you want this place to function as a host of mixes, they need to be searchable by genre, name of the DJ, and skill level.  The skill level flair isn't searchable so it doesn't do shit other than look pretty on the front page.

* Partner up with /r/edmradio and /r/emp (though EMP is a bit more like the Freemasons).  These guys could bring a fresh audience and strengthen /r/mixes as a constant stream of mixes and a way to bring the mix to the listen live, in a reactive and cool way.

*  Have some form of interaction with people who don't DJ.  I feel like everyone here is just after views on their own shit instead of seeking out mixes.  Once the above shit is pulled together, this subreddit should be spammed to Hell and back on every genre subreddit.

*  Mods, start posting reddit-award-winning mixes from around the site.  /r/DJs MotM winners, /r/beatmatch MotM winners, and genre winners should be able to be found here."	t5_2qipb	True

Please feel free to post any mixes that you would like to have hosted on the account, using the following rules (I am open to rule adjustments based on your feedback).

* post DJ name and Mix name
* post set list
* post download link

In the description of the mixes, I will put in the set list, as well as a link to your personal souncloud account as well, so people can follow you individually if they enjoyed your mix.

However I have a gripe;

When uploaded to Mixcloud, why does hardly anyone timestamp? It takes a very short amount of time... I can understand 3/10 mixes not being done on someones profile, but when it's all not timestamped it shows me how little time and effort you are putting into presenting your mix...Am I just being anal here, or does anyone else turn away from listening to a mix when it's not timestamped?

A few friends and I are starting something I'm excited about here in Asia. China is a huge, still largely untapped country full of interesting people and ideas. We want to do something about it.

***HOUSE OF D*** [http://facebook.com/houseofDchina](http://facebook.com/houseofDchina) is an international nightlife collective based in China. Our goal is to bridge Chinese alternative nightlife culture with the West and create something unique in the process. We accept any contributions from anyone that will forward our effort.

**We do not make a profit**; we are trying to connect a nightlife culture to both sides of the globe. I'm asking any producers / DJs / artists to submit something that they would like promoted in mainland China. We will be mostly net-based but will print limited edition materials (mixtapes, stickers etc) that we will distribute internationally, combining Chinese and Western expression.

If this sounds like something you are interested in, we are stoked to hear from you.

Things we like:

* People who seek culture over profit
* Original productions or remixes
* Mixes under 20 minutes

Thanks for your time. Here's our contact information:

I looked to see if there was a place for personal playlists or ""mix tapes"" and umm.. there really isn't. So, I'm putting this here. I like making my own ""CD Compilations"" and I thought I would make one called: ""The Internet Is Terrible.""

This is my personal work in progress. It's two discs long and I'm trying to figure out what to do with a Third Disc. It's a compilation of what makes the internet terrible: Memes. There's nothing actually political in it because political memes are more propaganda for one party or the other and not anywhere near as bizarre.

Here's the list so far. For the ""cover art"" I am using a picture of the Space Bat meme that appeared when I typed ""The Internet is Terrible"" into Google image search.

I am brand new to Reddit and trying to learn my way around. This is my very first post since I figured I'd be spending a lot of time in the /mixes.

There are some really good re-edits, remixs, and covers, as well as some classics you may recognize.

Enjoy
