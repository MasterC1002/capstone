"	The_Spoon_of_Origin	63	12	53	"Recently at Siggraph 2012 LA, Autodesk invited a small group of industry leads from different studios-the requirement being each studio had to have over a 1,000 employees- to a behind doors meeting. They were told to sign NDA's and were let in. I wasn't one of them but I heard from a friend who went.

From what I heard Autodesk is killing Motion Builder and instead going to build it into Maya. They also are no longer going to develop 3dsmax, at least on the animation side. I was told they were going to focus on a single solution for animation which will be Maya based.  My friend wasn't sure if this meant for modeling as well since they only talked about animation, so maybe 3dsmax is dropping dev for animation and focusing on modeling, while Maya for animation. They didn't say anything about XSI.


This is all I know, has anyone else heard any other news about this is have they not announced it yet?  I was wondering if this had anything to do with the recent layoffs at Autodesk as well. 


**EDIT: wow this blew up and went beyond reddit.** Just to clarify, I only meant that adesk was going to stop dev in max on new features, specifically animation ( maybe only animation).  I only posted to see if anyone had news if they were going to continue dev on the modeling instead. I didn't say anything about XSI getting EoL'ed."	t5_2qhfw	True

I was just thinking it would be a cool idea to compile a resource of videos that *you* think we should watch, it doesn’t have to be strictly VFX, it could be colour correction, editing, filming tips… etc but basically something you think that could help a visual effects artist better their repertoire.

Try not to find videos that are objectively teaching a program, although I have listed some “tutorials,” the teacher often talks about the theory behind why they did what they did, as opposed to button pushing. I’ll start!

[Rob Nederhorst’s creating highly realistic composites](http://www.thegnomonworkshop.com/store/product/973/#.UDZB8-1lZm0)

[Building tornados with FumeFX and Krakatoa by Matt Radford](http://www.digitaltutors.com/11/training.php?pid=557&amp;autoplay=1)

There was a few FXPHD courses, but they’ve been since taken down unfortunately.

**EDIT/UPDATE**

Articles I feel are worth reading!

[Mike Seymour on the art of destruction](http://www.fxguide.com/featured/art-of-destruction-or-art-of-blowing-crap-up/)

[CG Society’s ray tracing/radiosity versus point-based rendering in Pixar’s Renderman technology](http://www.cgsociety.org/index.php/CGSFeatures/CGSFeatureSpecial/pixar_points)

I would like to add user suggestions to this post but I feel it would be better to let them say it for themselves and it encourages discussion! Perhaps when we get enough submissions I will make a comprehensive guide out of it.

Wow, I'm dumb. Anyways, I worked for Frantic Films which is now Prime Focus VFX for about 8 years as a lead 2D compositor. I don't work in VFX anymore, since the lifestyle and hours were just not jiving with me anymore. I still love the work, I just hate the state of the industry. 

In any case, after I left, I started putting tutorials online talking about some of the basic and advanced techniques we'd use at work. 

Check it out at: http://vfxhaiku.com/

I don't update it as often as I should, but it's a decent resource to nail down some compositing fundamentals. It focuses on Fusion and After Effects.

If you haven't seen the tracking in Blender, check out [this time lapse video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHSQlFBHFWQ) or [this longer tutorial](http://vimeo.com/61500388) or [this demo of the planar tracking](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FBqpE4XO_s).

I'm happy to answer any questions you may have about the tracking module, but most importantly I'd like to understand what improvements you would like to see. So here are my questions for those doing VFX work:

1. Have you used Blender's motion tracking component?
2. Have you used Blender's tracker commercially?
3. If you haven't used Blender's tracker, why not?
4. What features would you like to see that would have the most impact on your work?
5. If we implement a feature you are interested in, would you be willing to beta test it and work with us to improve the tracker?

I will have some time to work on the Blender motion tracker this summer. We have some ideas about what we will be working on, but they are not set in stone. So please let the ideas fly! The more specific the ideas, the better."	t5_2qhfw	True

That talk might have reached you, but the follow up discussion quickly came to the conclusion that a walkout would be a bad idea. I've listed several of the reasons below.

* A walkout without a union to guide and organize would likely be sporadic and without a directed message.
* A walkout without a specific purpose (directed protest, etc) would turn into a stay at home day.
* A single day walkout would have zero impact on the film studios, only hurting facilities.

Instead on 3.14 I urge you to attend the [VFX Townhall](https://www.facebook.com/VfxSolidarityIntl?fref=ts) if possible. If you're ready, sign a rep card ( http://vfxunion.info this site has information for a lot of countries, not just US). If you're not ready, ask questions of **informed** individuals about the union.

I think an FAQ would be a great addition to this subreddit. Every so often we get people asking beginner questions.

Some questions that I think should be on the FAQ:

_______________________________________________________________________
***Which software is the best?***

There is no ""best"" software. These are tools that can only be as good as you are. Also, some are better at certain tasks than others. If you're just starting out, we recommend you pick one and stick with it. The skills you will learn are applicable to many other programs.

That said, here are some industry standards:

**3D Software:**

Maya (Mostly for Film &amp; Animation. Has the steepest learning curve, but it has a wide range of applications.)

3DS Max (Mostly Video Games &amp; Architecture &amp; TV.)

Cinema4D (Mostly Motion Graphics and TV)

XSI SoftImage (Mostly Film &amp; Animation. Its popularity is growing)


**FX/Simulation:**

Houdini is great for specialized effects and simulation. Chances are if you see digital fire in a film, it was made with Houdini. Wind, hair, cloth, and water simulation are also possible. If you want to further experiment with fluids/water, you can add RealFlow to Houdini, Maya and some other software.


**Sculpting/Detailing:**

Zbrush is the most widely used sculpting software. Mudbox, Sculptiris, and modo are other possibilities.


**Texturing/Matte painting:**

Photoshop is the most popular, as it is probably the most powerful digital painter out there. Mari and 3D Coat are programs that allow you to paint directly onto a 3d model, and are also used in the industry. If you really are on a budget, try GIMP instead of Photoshop.


**Compositing:**

If you want to composite, learn Nuke. Most of the other powerful compositors being used are proprietary in-house tools developed by the studio's own developers. They'll teach you how to use those if you get a job with them. Adobe After Effects as of now can be used for very simple, light compositing, but it's better for motion graphics.


**Tracking/Matchmoving:**

For 3D tracking and matchmoving, 3D Equalizer, Nuke's 3D Tracker and PfTrack are all good. Boujou and SynthEyes may be used too. Mocha is very common for 2D tracking.

_______________________________________________________________________

***Where do I go to learn this stuff?*** 
Assuming you aren't taking any college classes on this or would like to learn more there are many resources for you online. [FXPHD](http://www.fxphd.com/), [Digital Tutors](http://www.digitaltutors.com), [Gnomon Workshop](http://www.thegnomonworkshop.com), [Video Copilot](http://www.videocopilot.net/), [Greyscalegorilla](http://greyscalegorilla.com/blog/), [Video2Brain](http://www.video2brain.com/en/redirected.htm), [Lynda](http://www.lynda.com/, [TutsPlus](https://tutsplus.com/), [MattTrunks](http://www.mattrunks.com/en), and many more. Also get active and don't forget to ask questions/post your creations in online communities such as [polycount](http://www.polycount.com/forum/), [cgsociety/cgtalk](http://forums.cgsociety.org/), [deviantART](http://www.deviantart.com/), and [cghub](http://cghub.com/).

**The most important thing to remember when looking at tutorials:**

Copying tutorials once and moving on doesn't teach you anything. Once you're done with a tutorial, take the skills you just learned and make something that is entirely your own. Explore! Experiment so that you really understand how the tool works. It doesn't matter if you think the end result sucks. You're learning, unlike the people who copy these tutorials word for word.

_____________________________________________________________________

***What does an Effects Artist do and how do I become one?*** 
Effects artists do a lot of things really, their job description varies widely from studio to studio and film to film. At most VFX houses Effects artists do exactly what you would think. They blow things up, break things, dent things, create elements that interact with characters. We create snow, dust hits, debris, and pretty much anything that was missing during the shot that isn't a character. We are often responsible for the elements/weather as well(Oceans, clouds, storms, lightning, tornadoes). Some of us have modeled goo piles, rigged and animated mechanical arms, and set dressed post-destruction environments. We can be the department that catches the tasks that fall through the cracks in production. An effects artist might be asked to do things as random as making interesting screens for a scene in an arcade, or create the heads up display for a futuristic headset.

9 times out of 10, you will be working in Houdini. Feature wise(animated and live-action) you would be hard pressed to find larger studios that do NOT use Houdini for effects(not counting [Moving Picture Company](http://www.moving-picture.com/)). Naiad is heavily used for particle fluids, but with the Autodesk buyout that might change soon.

How do you become one? That is a toughie. You have to be incredibly self driven, because a lot of times there aren't a lot of good tutorials or information out there, and a lot of times you are going to have to do more work than any one department you work with. You have love problem solving because most of your time spent is answering either: ""How do I get this to behave correctly?"" or ""Why isn't it working?""(a common question-in fact I just heard this next to me). A basic understanding of trig, vector math, and calculus doesn't hurt. A good helping of scripting is also incredibly useful. You need to have an eye for timing, composition, and emotion as well. Learning Houdini is a must. Even if your studio doesn't use it, many of the alternatives are procedural node based systems and Houdini is arguably the best at implementing these 3d node systems. Depending on the project and the studio, you will probably need a basic understanding of lighting because it is more than likely you will be responsible for lighting your own effects. A working knowledge of shaders is also recommended. There are a lot of premade things out there, but sometimes it is just easier to wire up your own fresnel constant shader rather than tweak something.

Also, the Houdini community mostly exists on the [SESI boards](http://www.sidefx.com/index.php?option=com_forum&amp;Itemid=172) and the [ODForce boards](http://www.odforce.net). CMIVFX has some of the better tutorials out there but as far as learning Houdini the community tends to be awesome and provide example files if you merely ask.

***What does a Compositor do and how do I become one?*** 
A compositor's job is to make the final image look as though it were all shot at the same time, on the same camera. This can range from simply painting out wires in a shot, to layering many separate elements that shot on green-screen and filling in the background with multiple background photographs, to shots with hundreds of CG creatures or buildings that all need to look like they existed in one place at one time.

A compositor mostly works in a 2D world - dealing with flat images, whether its live action footage from the camera during the shoot, CG creatures, random CG elements from the renderer, or stills from a library. It is the digital equivalent of making a collage of cut out photographs. A compositor should understand what goes on inside a camera, as a lot of what ties a shot together are the imperfections that a lens and camera create in a shot. Things like grain, chromatic aberration and lens distortion are all imperfections that don't come with raw CG, but need to be added to ensure that the whole shot fits together. Even on a 100% fully CG shot, it will often be rendered as separate elements, and the compositor will be required to ensure that the shot comes together realistically, and that all of these imperfections are added to stop the shot from looking out of place in context with the non-CGI shots. One should also have a very good eye for colour, as the different elements may not have the same look, and grading them to make them fit is an essential part of making the shot work.
These days, most compositing packages have a certain amount of 3D capability built-in - this allows the compositor to have a certain amount of control over smaller elements of the shot, and be able to create new parts of the shot without needing to request 3D artists to make them.

To become a compositor, the best thing to do initially would be to teach yourself [Nuke](http://www.thefoundry.co.uk/products/nuke/). If you go to [The Foundry's website](http://www.thefoundry.co.uk) you'll find a free downloadable PLE (Personal Learning Edition) which gives you full functionality, except for a watermark that is applied to any image that you render out. There are a lot of good tutorials on the website, plus [fxphd](http://www.fxphd.com) has some well-regarded Nuke training.

The career path for a compositor often starts out with rotoscoping. This is an entry-level job where the task is to generate mattes for elements that weren't shot on green (or blue) screen. Often, the complexities of a shot mean that there are CG elements that need to be placed between live-action characters, so a green screen would never have worked on the shoot. After rotoscoping, an aspiring compositor would then move onto what is known as ""prep"". This is usually anything that requires removing something from a shot, whether it is wires from a stunt or tracking markers that had been places for the matchmovers, it'll be the job of the Prep team to remove them and pass on the results to the compositors. After doing Roto and Prep (often part of the same department - Roto/Prep), the next stage is as a Junior Compositor. At this stage, it's purely a matter of experience and ability to progress to Compositor and then Senior Compositor. After that, one might take on more of a leadership role, as a Lead Compositor, Sequence Lead, Compositing Supervisor, up to VFX Supervisor, but all of those are outside the scope of this answer.

As a compositor, there are a number of things that you should understand, but the two key skills you need are a good eye for colour, and an understanding of photography.

***I want to build/upgrade my computer for VFX related work, what should I look for? (PC Related)*** 
If you're just starting out, don't just start buying all this stuff. VFX workstations are expensive. Work with what you have as best as you can, and if you end up really liking it, then drop the money. 

This is just a basic outline on what to look for. 

*CPU (Processors)*: i7 Intel processors are currently the best bang for your buck and work the fastest with your software. If you have the budget, you can go for dual physical Xeon processors. Keep in mind, while AMD processors are cheaper, they do not run as fast as Intel when using most of these applications. 

*RAM*: 16 GB of RAM is recommended to start with. If you have the budget, and if your motherboard allows it, you should upgrade that to 32 or even 64 gb especially if you are dealing simulations in Houdini. (64 gb of RAM can be overkill, so don't kill yourself for it). 

*GPU (Graphics Card)*: Nvidia GeForce cards anywhere from 460 to 680 will do just fine. If you have the money, it is strongly recommended you get a Quadro card. It is also good to note that two GPU cards do not make a difference as most of the programs only use one of them. 

*Harddrives*: It is highly recommended that you get yourself a SSD (Solid State Drive) and install your OS and software on it. Then keep your storage and projects on a separate internal or external hard drive. It is extremely recommended you have a separate external hard drive to frequently back things up. Just remember it's a computer and shit happens. Back up your shit. *Do you hear that?* **BACK UP YOUR SHIT.**

Primary thing I learned was that I should have shot with a high shutter speed to avoid motion blur and then reintroduce later. Also, the right ISO for less grain would have been helpful...even at 3K.

But as an Animation &amp; VFX student in the UK, I'd quite like to know how it is in the UK?
From my perspective it's not great, of 20 people in my year on my university course nobody managed to get a relavent industrial placement paid or free. 
Personally I've managed to get a couple of weeks free internship this summer but that was only through a family friend. When applying for industrial placements back in October I probably emailed 50 companies all over the country and none of them seemed at all keen from any aspect.

So for those currently working in the UK, what's your opinion?

What really heavily matters and what falls to the wayside. Where current classes go right or go wrong.  
  
I just came out of a program that taught me Maya and After Effects. It was a general program but it gave me enough sample experience with different work that I came to learn where I like to be on a project and where I feel comfortable and capable of expanding.  
  
But I know this is a personal stance, that other people would have drastically different motivations or interests.  
  
So I pose the question, what would the ""ideal vfx course"" look like to people here. What techniques, software, case studies would tie it together for you. Is it about making a wide array of flashy blockbuster effects, or making small things that can't be noticed as amiss in a scene. Is it the composition and delicate balance in creating a scene or cramming in as much eye candy as possible.  
  
Is it about the tools, or the trade. The effort or the result.  
  
If someone came at you and said ""Man, I want to work in vfx."" What kind of knowledge would you slap them with, if they could retain a moderate spectrum of information and material.  
  
Would you encourage a Nuke/Mari/Ocula/Maya workflow or approach with After Effects, Houdini and Silhouette V4.  
  
I'm kind of curious if we can't create a collection of materials for this craft. VFX still reads from the outside as some whimsical profession that involves sleepless weeks and a crap-ton of people and accomplishes a relatively showy amount of product in turn.  
  
I had a friend that was surprised to learn more than one company worked on vfx for films like Harry Potter or Avengers and wondered ""what vfx really does anyways""  
  
I know there's articles for the people who already understand it, but what about the people who are completely absent of this as an employment field.  
  
So I guess, all in all, I'm wondering... Can we not put something in that sidebar that makes newcomers, the ""random"" clickers of reddit, the stumbler's of the web. Can we not put something that would give to people a ""What, Why, Where, How"" of the field. A cumulative ""beginners guide"" to vfx if you would.  "	t5_2qhfw	True

Now approved and official

* Only 3 bidders were deemed qualified: Brave Vision, Prime Focus and 34x118 Holdings (which has the same address as Prana)
* The BV bid was deemed the highest initial bid.
* Auction started at 3pm on the 27th, and accepted final bids from PF and BV at 3:15 am
* After Holdings was let back into the race, Holdings and Prime Focus submitted additional bids.

* The Holdings bid was selected (more on THAT below), and holdings
provided a letter from Comerica Bank stating over 15 million in
available cash.

* 1.2 million in cash, 6 million in pre bankruptcy unsecured loans becoming post bankruptcy loans, 17 million in full assumption of DIP loans, all cure amounts for current contracts (SESI software, etc- this amount isn't tallied up here), all current employees PTO WHO ARE RETAINED after competition of our current projects (minimum 165 employees, estimated at 4-5 million).

* Total amount seems to be 33-36 million. (Confirmed, Hollywood Reporter etc have an incorrect number)



Prime Focus is disputing (loudly apparently) Holdings being selected as
the winner, as PF was not allowed to submit additional bids after that-
everyone told PF no because..

The Debtor, Unsecured Creditors Committee, DIP lendors all refuse to let
PF bid because:

1) The views of the Unsecured Creditors Committee and DIP lendors RE
Prime Focus

2) The ability of Holdings being able to retain people to finish current projects (IE: They're expecting a lot of people quitting if PF was selected OR they don't think PF can pay enough people to finish the projects)

3) The greater liklihood of the Holdings sale actually closing (given
PF's inability to close a sale preBK) "	t5_2qhfw	True

I'm using Nuke, I figured rotoing the basic outline where the hard edges begin to blur and then expanding the secondary line(the little dotted line) to the blurred edge at each keyframe would be sufficient. Is there a better way of doing motion blur?

Another idea would be rotoing the hard edge and using a transform to translate and add motion blur in after the fact. I tried this but my shape was pretty inconsistent with the blur on the plate thus I ended up having to noodle each frame which is undesirable.

My school doesn't really have many opportunities in VFX let alone outside of Orlando (I go to UCF). I don't know specifically what I want to get into as far as VFX goes but i was hoping a general post production internship could help me figure that out.

I don't make personal projects anymore, nor am I here to offer you a freebee for 'great exposure' ... I just have a genuine question that's lingered with me ever since I got into this business:

I did lots and lots of low/no pay jobs when starting out, but I never saw evidence that visual FX artists did much of the same thing.  My film school had a 3D animation wing, and I often visited in hopes of finding likeminded ""film makers"" trained in their respective FX areas.  I tried to do plenty of collaborative projects, and succeeded quite well in gathering almost every other department to work with me: actors, musicians, writers, camera operators, editors, you name it -- we were all hungry for work and wanted to make something reel-worthy.  I never had such luck with my fellow visual effects peers.  They never seemed interested.  I eventually got the impression VFX must be so ""in demand"" that they simply didn't need to do these projects... they were somehow above it. 

Nowadays I feel that VFX artists are hugely under appreciated, and I hear so many horror stories about that aspect of the industry.  I am not quite sure if any of my previous perceptions (or my current) are accurate anymore.  What is the state of the industry for VFX workers in North America?

Edit: Judging by the comments I want to clarify something: I'm not asking why established artists don't work for free.  I'm in the same boat in that regard -- I don't work for free.  I'm talking about collaborating when you were learning your craft and building demo material.  I simply saw a disproportion of all other types of artists collaborating and the VFX guys often seemed to be left out.  I never really knew why this was, or if it was simply something with me -- that is all.  "	t5_2qhfw	True
1350260307.0	11hi8r	I once wanted to be a VFX Compositor... Maybe I'll give it another shot, any tips?	geek180	15	5	20	"When I was in high school I wanted very badly to work in VFX. Video Copilot was my homepage and I did a ton of after effects work for fun after school. [This animation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNxoLJy3m3s) was the coolest thing I ever did imo.

I am in college now for PR and marketing and I don't really enjoy it and can't imagine actually working in that field. Its a public university and they don't have any sort of animation or vfx degrees/courses, which is why I sorta lost my interest in CGI in the first place. I've been thinking a lot getting back into it and relearning what I've forgotten and perhaps one day trying to make it a career. Where should I start if I'd like to do compositing work? Actual animation was never my strong point since I'm really no good at drawing. I'm so out of the loop now I have no idea where to begin.... Thanks

The director wants to do it with some kind of green-screen/green-suit type of compositing but has never done any sort of similar vfx work before. We'd be hiring pros here to do the compositing for us, but he has, unfortunately, charged me with doing some preliminary research on how to approach filming such a scene. I'm just a lowly editor, but we are a small company and he's asking me to go out of my comfort zone here to gather some info and perspective on how to approach this scene from a camera/cinematography perspective. Any general tips of wisdom you guys/gals could pass along? Or could you point me to a suitable noob forum who might be able to help? I saw [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/vfx/comments/1d3uv2/good_vfx_forums/) post and it seemed like the consensus was that this was a pretty decent place to ask vfx questions.

1367340739.0	1df59k	Render size for a video wall - clients thinks 9k - madness!	letsgocrazy	15	4	23	"So a client of mine has been asked to show work at an exhibit where they are using 28 tvs as a video wall. Overall resolution (he thinks) is likely to be 9k.

But that seems higher than iMax (8k)

This can't be right can it? would anyone actually render to a video wall that large? is it going to be 28 computers playing to each monitor, or is it going to be one playing all the videos? Because I have doubts about anything being able to play that kind of resolution outside of some heavy duty iMax projector.

This isn't even taking into account render times and file sizes.

I think my client must have taken a guess based ont he TV resolutions.

Anyone have any experience in this area?

**edit:** thanks for the replies everyone. I'm not doing the project. I emailed the client with my reservations and he said they were going to go with someone else who works with the editor they are going to use. 

I'm glad really - this job just had too many alarm bells for me - and a short time budget as well, never a good combo!

Since the level of work I work at has gone up quite a bit and hardware requirements have risen as well I'm looking to upgrade it significantly, if that makes sense. Especially in GPU technology I've seen some insane advantages in render times over my machine that colleagues of mine have with cards that aren't even top of the line, like the GTX 660.

The most demanding software I work with includes:

* **[CINEMA 4D](http://www.maxon.net/en/products/cinema-4d-studio/who-should-use-it.html)** + VRAY
* **[Vue](http://www.e-onsoftware.com/products/vue/vue_11_xstream/)**

* **[Adobe Premiere Pro CS6](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)**
* **[SCRATCH](http://www.assimilateinc.com/products-scratch-overview)**

So what do you suggest I do?

I was thinking about getting a new and powerful (NVIDIA) GPU, 64GB of RAM and upgrading my processor. Especially the latter is a bit difficult for me... are there any good and financially not completely unreasonable double-CPU options out there now? One year ago I was looking for a dual six-core or even dual eight-core setup but was told I'd have to wait around half a year longer until there were really great options for that available.

How is it looking now? Maybe somebody knows the software I use and can make some recommendations on what would be the most efficient upgrades in terms of bang for buck. :)"	t5_2qhfw	True

1357756583.0	169fdg	DIY motion control dolly on the cheap.	eodmpink	10	0	3	"I've been wanting to experiment with motion control shooting for sometime now, but being a starving student renting is a bit out of reach especially if all I want to do is dick around with it in my bedroom. So I decided to look into the DIY approach and what I found was that, at least for a dslr-weight single-axis system, it was pretty easy to do for under say 150 bucks.

From what I've gathered true repeatable multi-axis moco just plain isn't a cheap thing to do and nearly impossible to DIY without some fair electrical and mechanical engineering skill, so I'll just state off the bat that the system I detail here does have significant drift and the resulting footage will need to be massaged in a compositor.

Now, at the beginning of the project I already had a pico dolly, an Arduino, and Maya on hand so I wanted those three elements to be the basis of my system. Simple googling led me to other DIY projects that utilized those elements, notably for the dolly design and Arduino/Maya interfacing, so my system is essentially a combination of the two.

**Dolly and Slider**

There are numerous motorized dollies and slider designs that people have built posted all over the web, but the simplest/cheapest solution I found was this [friction-drive based build](http://dim3m.com/motorized-pico-dolly/) by dim3m.
Just replace the servo driver with an Arduino and the battery pack with a usb cable extender in the parts list.

For the slider I slapped together some window screen framing, nuts and bolts, and a piece of wood flooring I found in the closet to make a 36 incher with hard stops. The benefit of using a skater dolly here is that you can make your track as long as you want or forget the track altogether and use a flat surface for curved camera moves.  

**Arduino and Maya**

In 2009 Dan Thompson released [Servo Tools for Maya](http://danthompsonsblog.blogspot.com/search/label/Servo%20Tools%20For%20Maya) a set of Arduino, Python, and mel scripts that enable Maya to interface with servos through an Arduino over serial communications. His installation videos are fantastic and even someone like me with only passing knowledge of Arduinos, Maya, and Python can get it setup in an afternoon.

I also wrote a [python script](https://docs.google.com/folder/d/0B9nXRkJ53q-hUG1ibkQ3TzNMVHM/edit) that’s designed to work with Servo Tools that adds convenient key frame flipping/mirroring for return moves and audible cueing functionality to assist in the shooting process. It’s not essential to get the system running, but feel free to check it out anyways.

**Shooting**

Now since I went with a cheap continuous servo as my motor there is no positional encoding and thus a fair amount of drift and stuttering motion from internal gear slippage. This is unavoidable at this price point. There are however measures you can take to minimize drift such as easing in and out of your camera moves, using counterweights to balance the dolly, using the slider hard stops to reset the camera by hand, and taking out as much backlash from the motor to the dolly wheel as you can. I got my drift down to +/- ¼ inch on a 34 inch move after some trial and error. Also it’s tethered so you’ll have to hold the cabling during the move to avoid drag.

**Post** 

Once you’ve shot your passes and imported the footage into a compositor use a difference blend mode to help with alignment. If you’ve got access to Furnace Core’s align node in Nuke, [which is goddamn amazing](https://vimeo.com/18824558), the alignment process becomes pretty trivial. Loss of resolution is a given and some filling at the edges may be in order, but that’s what you get for $150.

Ok, so that’s my quick and dirty rundown. It’s not an elegant solution and is quite limited, but for a couple of afternoons of work and a bit of cash a system like this is workable for experimenting with motion control and definitely fun to play with.

We all love photo-real CGI and cars :) and decided to start a little collab together.. 

I did all of the texturing, shading lighting and rendering for this project.. my mates did the rest. Only thing I modeled was the projector in the opening sequence.
The sequence was created using Maya, V-Ray, Nuke and After Effects.




This is about 30% of the full thing, will post the finished thing up here when we're done.

But for now would appreciate some feedback on what you guys think.

Additional info:

 both myself and my girlfriend landed a job at big companies in LA right out of school. We've been wondering about working around the world since we took a semester abroad in Hong Kong. I'd ask people at work but I don't want to come off as un-interested in my future there. 


Some questions I have:

* Were there any places you worked where you had to take a major paycut to work there? I understand most artist who hop company to company keep track of what their worth per hour, does that reset or get readjusted per country?

* What was your favorite city to work in?
Least favorite?

* How would you compare working in LA to working in the rest of the world?

* What countries/cities don't take foreigners? (generally speaking)

* how long would you stay in one place? years, months, weeks?

* what was your favorite/least favorite studio to work for?

* what was the market like for storyboard artists (my girlfriend) vs lighting artists (me) out in other countries? 

* What was the hardest thing about living the globe-traveling free-lancing lifestyle? 

* How big of a problem would knowing only english be when working around the world? (From first or second hand experience)

* If you've stopped moving from country to country, why?

* any words/tales of warning you would share with someone thinking of traveling the world doing what we do?


Some places I'd like to work:

* Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, South-Korea, UK, France, Germany, Sweden, Thailand, Taiwan, Australia, Ireland, so on and so forth. 

Sorry if TLDR, If there's a better place to post this point me there and I'll promptly GTFO. Thanks!

1353227172.0	13e4p7	Trying to find a good VFX team and failing miserably.  Very frustrated and hoping you guys could help me out with some advice! 	NeedFilmmakingAdvice	14	5	21	"Hi Reddit! I'd like my regular account to remain separate from anything related to this, thus the throwaway.

A little history:

I'm producing a video game based short film around a popular video game franchise. I conceptualized this back in 2004, and actually started work on it in 2010. We released a series of visual imagery to gain steam for our project, and it went over very well. The fans went crazy for it, and some of our images were even on the front page of reddit for a bit. Needless to say, because we received huge press on many of the popular gaming websites, it helped us slowly collect a group of exceptionally talented people.

So that's where we are now. So now that you know a little history, my problem is that I am having the absolute worst time in the entire world, and have for the past 3 years, of locking down any sort of quality VFX, 3D work, or any post production that is not just basic editing work. I can't even begin to grasp what it takes to do VFX, and I know it's very tough work, but I don't understand why this specifically has been such an arduous thing to accomplish.

What we are trying to do is exceptionally ambitious, and we've got all the building blocks to do it, it just seems like a good post team (aside from a talented matte painter, which we have) is just impossible to find, and those that we have found have always promised the world,  and then completely flaked out.

At this point, I'm coming to you guys about this.  I don't really understand why this keeps happening, and what I'm missing.  Is this a common trait among post artists, or is there something I'm doing that I'm not noticing?  We are paying, and when this is complete it will be the reel piece of a lifetime for many a geeky VFX artist.  

Thanks!

TL;DR finding good VFX and CGI artists that will not flake out after promising the world is the bane of my existence. Advice on how to overcome this is loved!

I feel confident about knowledge, I understand the principles and can see where/how things can be fixed to look nicer. But in a student film-school context, all my projects were rushed out over 3 days or less. As a result I'm having a tough time getting my reel to look like something I could be hired over.  
  
I'm currently in Toronto and looking for work as a compositor, I know After Effects and expressions. I can prototype a Python script in the ORSDK for Motionbuilder and I've got just enough understanding to feel like my toes are wet about Fluids, nCloth, DMM, RBD, SBD and Particles in Maya... But in no way have I found a time to get my hands on a decent camera and go shoot pieces. Or to create anything completely in CG.  
  
So this is what I'm wondering, if I decide to just do freebies for short films/student projects. To work on tiny things for dirt cheap or literally nothing... Would it be harm or hinderance.  
  
I don't know what to do. I am supposed to do an internship by working at a company as an 'assistant' or something. But no one has replied and most anywhere I find in the area is calling for Nuke, Shake, Flame or Fusion knowledge. Which I just don't have.  
  
It's likely a lot of fear and just anxiety at the idea that I'm just no good, that I'm disillusioned. But I'm damn certain I can do the work, that I can learn Nuke on my own and that I can turn out product worth broadcasting. I just don't know what to do from here.  
  
I'm sorry to be asking this but just any help or projects you need help with in AE... let me know.  
  
Help me r/vfx... you're my only hope.


**edit for clarity**: I began learning after effects 6 years ago. The program I just took (postsecondary film program) has been going for 3 years and pushing after effects. Now I'm near graduation and am taking in that what I've been taught is largely irrelevant. I will be learning Nuke by the PLE and downloaded the Manual and resources also whatever Lynda.com can offer. At 36k in debt I can't afford to not use solely free resources and common sense. It's how I've learnt most things thus far, it's, after this experience with college, the only way to go.  
  
I do enjoy writing Python so I'll be aiming for that. My only experience with nodal anything is Houdini. I've 'played' with just about every software, it's just once my program picked up speed and people asked me to do comps, I was only able to turn them out in after effects so the space to learn outside of the classroom just wasn't there. I've spoken to my course co-ordinator and am now working in Maya to finish up my dynamics project (If you have tips for why my road isn't taking shadows that'd be awesome but also it's own post). It was agreed I'll work for a month with the school full-time paid and then begin my co-op later than the others. during that time I'm expected to (and obviously will) learn Nuke... and then apply python to all the things.  
  
Prior to coming here I was writing Java in a Comp Sci program and doing network IT/management... So the tech part is easy, it's just adjusting to nodal that i worry will slow me down.

I was browsing on reddit and stumbled upon these posts. One is a video and the other is a gif. I was wondering how people make them; what software they use, how long it takes. It looks really incredible. I really love them, how they overlay digital effects on a real world setting and make it not seem so awkward. 

Just wanting some background information on the production of this type of art.

Student here with a question for a project I'm doing. What may be the best approach to make "" Energy Rings"" that are generated from a sphere? It's for a flying egg shaped robot, the sphere would be on the bottom half. The rings would be generated and flow / move down to the ground as a way to show thrust / stability, etc.. So shooting downwards. The robot will be modeled in Maya and then comped over live action in either Nuke or AE. The sphere and the rings will have some glow and maybe some slight particles / fractal noise to make it not seem so solid.
So this is my thought, model it ( the rings)  in Maya to be able to control timing, shape, etc. Have that separated out in it's own set of passes then I can use a matte pass along with depth / AO to control the actual look and feel. Along with how they may interact with the environment and the various lighting conditions.
Here are 2 images for reference:
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/yVdQgqC)  - start of the ring generation
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/LBucXia) - near the end of the ring generation

So...any suggestions? Any input would be greatly appreciated. I'm sure there are numerous ways to accomplish this.

    Math.round(random(10,90))

expression (and variations from it). I don't really know how to influence the speed of them yet, since I'm just starting to work with expressions that go past wiggle.

Do you guys know a better expression to use?

I'm also currently working on a second FUI for that shoot tomorrow where I'd like to have some random code-like Text to generate. Think more like Matrix, less actual code.

The FUI I linked above kind of has this - I used the Character Offset Text-Animator, but it won't change the length of the Text, doesn't write itself on/off. Basically, it doesn't really look random.

It would be awesome if you guys could help me out with this.

So - not only do you have to lug your tower around but you're also using your Nuke license. Maybe I'm overreacting but this rubs me the wrong way. What do you guys think?


1. You must have at least 3yrs experience with Nuke.

2. You must have your own system with Nuke software and capable of handling 2K files.

3. You must work from our office in Hollywood. This in NON-NEGOTIABLE. Do not apply otherwise. We are not looking for loners we need to have our team together banging this out so we can reach our deadline.
4. This is a 2 week position and requires your FULL TIME. We have a deadline and you will be required to do a minimum of 15 to 20 shots per day. If you are not fast and great...do not apply.

Sadly this is indie low budget project. We need passionate filmmakers who understand that sometimes jobs can pay well, and sometimes due to the constraints of the project the pay is lower then normal. Thank you for your understanding.

-Should I seek out specific accountants come tax season to handle this or should they all be familiar with the tax code as it pertains to us?  

-From the bit of research I've done the 1099/net 30 plan isn't ideal, but should I be watching for specific things my employer might be doing to exploit this agreement?  

-Is there any benefit to incorporating myself or something along those lines?

I'm an FX student at Vanarts, seeking some insight into the local scene. I've had no previous experience with vfx before the program, and I'm happily focusing on Maya particle/rigid-body dynamics (and, reluctantly, with Houdini). The schools like to hype up the idea of getting a job directly after school, but from what I understand, for those as 'green' as I am, that's not exactly a realistic expectation. I know that the demo reel is the best focus, but I'm just curious as to opportunities within the community.

SO.

-What are the odds of finding independent work here, and what are your experiences with it?

-What are some need-to-know dirties/positives about the local studios?

-As mentioned before, I'm reluctant, yet still motivated to learn Houdini, but I enjoy Maya far more. Any insight into the alleged popular migration towards Houdini?

And finally, I want to do music videos. Badly. I love the idea of immersing myself in music via VFX, and vice-versa. 

-Are there studios that focus on this? 

-&amp;I've heard of programs/functions that allow an easier sync between the FX and music. Enlighten me!


**EDIT** I have been learning Houdini, but there's something about node-based interfaces that just don't 'click' as well as they should with my brain. Its just something I have to overcome, I suppose. I like it so far, but certain things like shading networks just get me frazzled."	t5_2qhfw	True

Here is an image of where the logo [used to be](http://imgur.com/8wR0yTY) in case it's not obvious from the video clips.

Here are the results from my [1st attempt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/108820097/Sequence-H.264.mov). The track wasn't perfect and slipped quite a bit. This forced me to manually clean up some edges when my clean plate didn't quite line up properly. Other times I would get strange issues where the remove tool would properly replace the logo from the clean plate but the color would be way off. It appeared it was getting spill by sampling colors from foreground objects and assuming the illumination was changing drastically and trying to accommodate for it.

So, for these problem frames I just manually painted the logo out in Photoshop. I attempted both clone stamp and content aware tools. When I would look at a single frame it looked pretty good but when you watch them in sequence it's quite obvious the paint job is poor and pretty obvious watching their are artifacts.

Several months later after becoming much more experienced with Mocha I tried it again. Here is my [2nd attempt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/108820097/Sequence2-H.264.mov) with a rock solid track and better roto shapes on the foreground elements which seemed to eliminate almost all of the illumination spill problems. However, no matter how hard i try and how perfect I get my roto shapes there are still strange illumination model goofs that I couldn't fix no matter how much time I spent keyframing specific settings.

So I still need to manually paint out a few frames. How can I do this so I don't get strange artifacts like in attempt 1? How did VFXs artists do this stuff in the past when we didn't have fancy remove tools liket this? I mean when I look at a single frame in Photoshop it looks fine but when you play them back to back it's obviously bad.

The problem is that I've never worked with r3d files. What I'm trying to figure out is what the best workflow would be for bringing those files into after effects, and potentially photoshop, as I can't seem to do any RAW image adjustments in After Effects. I plan on handing this off to a colourist sometime later this month, but I can't figure out whether I should:

* Do the RAW file adjustments myself (mostly brightness and contrast, potentially in RedCine-X or Premiere Pro),
* Do VFX in After Effects,
* Export an uncompressed video file,
* Give the colourist my Premiere Pro timeline.

Or alternatively:

* Wait until the colourist does his work (including RAW file adjustments),
* *Then* do VFX in After Effects.

However, when looking for freelance work overseas, I'm not sure which kinds of companies to approach.

if I were trying to isolate a moving car from a pretty wide shot with a roto matte in AE (without the dreaded roto brush of course), would the following workflow make sense for efficiency?

Since the basic shapes of certain elements of the car don't change much while it moves across the screen, whereas some details like the bumper, wheels, and mirrors change quite a bit as it approaches and passes, I would

1. Do a simple 1-point track to maybe the door handle which would be applied to a solid large enough to cover up the entire car

2. Mask the general outline of the car on this solid, so that the mask travels with the car and only needs to be adjusted ever so slightly as the car passes

3. Repeat steps 1 &amp; 2 for additional parts of the car, thus reducing the necessary number of keyframes for each partial mask, since I only need to compensate for mask shape, not position

4. Combine the resulting masked solids into my final matte

This is probably a very basic question, but I'd love to hear your advice.
Thanks!

Just seeking out some advice on a shot my friend needs me to put in their production.

The idea is to create the rainbow effect that you acheive when you put pressure on a liquid crystal screen.  

The shot needs to be composed into a scene where the character experiences the phenomenom in reality.  So it needs to be motion tracked onto a surface with Mocha.

My idea so far is to use a colour gradient and mask it according to where the pressure appears to be applied.  I feel like the way you can manipulate the colour positions creates the effect well, but I'm not sure.

I have this guy here, I need to add muzzle flashes. The problem is I cant figure out a way to add them in to make it look decent. As you can see in the small filmstrip, the guy shoots the gun across the screen. And the movie is really dark, so I cant just set the opacity down or lower the brightness (it doesnt look good). I have AE2 and After Effects cs5. Any help is appreciative. 

FYI: I was not there on set, if I was I probably would have made a lot of changes. Also, I need to add a flash in the environment, but since the movie is naturally dark, it won't work.

EDIT: Forgot to mention. I cannot track it because Mocha cant see it, it's too dark.

Starting at 06:30 is a car chase that required two characters to exchange gunfire between a sedan and the back of an SUV.  Because we didn't want to have the actors actually wielding guns in public streets, all the shots where they're firing guns had to be VFX.

We shot the plate shots of the cars driving on the street, and then framed the green screen composite shots of the actors in/on the cars from the exact same angle.  I then tracked the movement of the cars and composited the two together.

This is the final product (whole film—again, car sequence starts at 06:30):

So growing up I had two fascinations: programming and vfx. I have fond memories of capturing video with a miroVideo DC1, rotoscoping in PS, compositing 3d animations for 3dsr4, etc (late 90's).


After high school I was pretty set on working in the film/tv, but after a few years of the realities of the industry I went back and finished my bs in comp sci. During uni I did take a quick dip into image processing, but school, work and other projects kind of pushed that aside. Now that I've been a embedded developer (sensors, robotics, etc) a number of years and more or less settled down, I'd like to get involved in something that can say, mesh programming and vfx. I have really no idea where to look, I feel completely out of the loop here. 

Are there any worthwhile open source projects that seem to have potential? How is the demand for those with programming experience in the vfx industry?

I have used this technique within After Effects using particular and it worked fairly well, but I was hoping Nuke's true 3D environment would really advance the effect.

It's as if a crosshatch section over the entire image is shifted over about 100 pixels. This error decreases over the timeline as we get towards the reference frame of the tracker nodes (the last frame), till it is entirely gone. The filter on the tracking nodes is Impulse, which is to say no filtering, to preserve image quality. If I change it to something like Cubic, this softens out the errors but is still not acceptable.

They are a couple ways to use this technique in different effects, and I have no idea how it's done.

Basically imagine you have no motion control rig on the camera so you can't film a clean plate, you have to remove an actor's hand from a moving shot. How do you do that?

It's not something I have to do but I'm wondering, I heard you track a clean plate took afterward but what's the point of tracking a clean plate that is not replicating the original camera move? I'm confused by that.

In the after effects timeline (not the render que) my i7 would use 100% cpu to render the frame. However my xeons never go beyond 20%. In a complex scene they will literally sit there for 2 minutes on 9%, drawing the frame. The i7 (using 100% cpu) renders the frame much faster!

In the render que it is possible to get my xeons to get to 100% using multi-processing, but it is unacceptable that this very expensive rig is far slower than my 2600k in the timeline. If i can't solve this problem i will have no choice but to abandon my xeons and go back to the 2600k.

Is anyone else running dual xeons in ae? Are you getting higher cpu usage than 20%? 

One possibility is that because my xeons are engineering samples from ebay they aren't as effective as retail. However maya utilises 100% cpu usage from them all the time. It's just after effects i'm having trouble with. Any advice is much appreciated.

I've tried to solve the footage with After Effects 3D Camera Solver, Voodoo and Blender Camera Tracking all with very poor results even after running it through Rolling Shutter Repair.

Questions:

* Is this happening because of rolling shutter or because I'm a noob who doesn't have a clue?
* Do I need to get my hands on a 3CCD camera instead of the CMOS ones I'm using? Are they still making cheap ones?
* Should I give up on free-ish software solutions and get Syntheyes or PFMatchit or should the above software work fine if I have proper footage?

Problem is the film back is tied to some aspect ratio. For example i know my film back is 5.37mm x 4.04mm, but when i type in the width of 5.37mm it automatically tells me the height must be 3mm. If i told it the height was 4.04mm it tells me the width must be 7.1mm.

The only way pftrack will return the correct height when i feed it the width is if i input the 1440x1080 footage and tell it the pixel aspect ratio is 1.0 (which is a lie, it is 1.3333 anamorphic).

I have reasonable experience with Syntheyes but mainly for VFX scenes that can easily built or tweaked around the match. (Laying out the scene in view).


We use a 3d Model of the city we work in, that is reasonably accurate (geometry from LIDAR) for all of our Architectural work. 

**The match needs to be aligned perfectly (across the whole city skyline, not just the localised site, if possible)  with existing geometry that cannot be relocated. My solve has to be in its 'real world position'.**

I'm fine on the tracking side and can achieve the right scale (based on the Lidar impoted into SE) and a rough alignment then export, but I have mainly been aligning the solve in Lightwave. A very manual proccess, but I do a lot of static camera matching in my job so the results have worked fairly well so far. 

**I know it is possible to align the scene to LIDAR geomtry (not points) but I just can't work it out.**

There are a lot of tutorials out there but I cant find any that cover it.  Most of them cover object tracking but not alignment the camera to existing geometry. For some reason I just can't get my head round those specific pages in the manual. 

Please could someone explain it, or point me in the direction of a tutorial that covers it specifically. Thanks for the time!

So i'm pretty seasoned when it comes to this but I never had to work with such footage and was wondering how it was done. Bare in mind I only have access to After Effects CS6 3D Tracker (It's not the best thing in the world, but when a quick track does the trick, it's awesome) and Boujou.

Now I see in a lot of professional shows CG integration where the camera is handheld (Ex : Cloverfield) , moves a lot and sometimes does a movement where the initial scene is not even in the view anymore . Ex : Looks at object at right, then pans in handheld to something completely different at left.

Now I was wondering, wouldn't that throw any tracker off ? The fact that for some frame inbetween the camera switching for right to left , no points will be at the same time in the right side and in the left side?

I'm just working on the shot for my demo-reel, and I've committed to doing it in Maya, as I am far more comfortable with the workflow and interface.

My problem is as such: my main dynamic simulation in the scene involves an alien mothership materializing out of the skies. I want to have about 250 particles in random global positioning slowly fill the mothership geometry, at which point I will fade in the textured geometry of the actual model.

Now, I know the process of guided particles, and (of course) the ""Fill Object"" option, it's just that I'm not entirely sure how to connect the two, so the guided particles *become* the mothership.

Now if there is an easier way to do this on cinema 4d, pleae let me know. I understand It's just a lot of smaller squares with a black texture, refraction, reflection, etc. But I'm more concerned with:

a) The particles, as in, the explosion of little pieces coming together. Is this an explosion and then reversed? Would it be easier to making things explode and then reverse them? Or is it easy to make things come together. 

b) Are they actually a particle system? Or is it just a lot of different model squares? What is the easiest way to do this? Is there a function/button/plugin that will allow me to break a model into individual smaller models of shapes, such as a square?

1320895765.0	m6yxz	To all people in the VFX industry, am I viable or late to the game?	hammysantana	4	0	0	"This message is mainly for those in the VFX industry, although I do welcome all comments and suggestions.

For a long time now I've had a huge interest in the arts (drawing, sculpting, animation, music, etc.) but I have never really pursued it further than the occasional hobby (play some basic guitar, sketching during free time, etc.).  Once I graduated high school I focused on electrical engineering, which is the focus of my current employment (full time microchip designer) and school (trying to finish up my Ph.D. in the field).  

About 5/6 years ago I started learning more about VFX.  I started checking out what is actually part of the whole field.  I've learned things like rigging, comps, etc, but only in theory.  I've played around with some software, mainly like Adobe AE, but I am by no means anything to be considered ""viable"" for actually implementing anything that looks decent.  

My main focus now (outside of work and school) is to develop my ""soft"" skills, so I am taking some art classes on the side to get up to speed on things like lighting, color theory, etc.

Anyways, long story short, I ""feel"" that my passion lies in this area.  After reading up on all the different avenues in VFX, I think compositing is what calls to me the most (assuming I am using the term correctly, in that this involves incorporating 2 or more shots/objects into one so they look seamless).  

Unfortunately, I feel that I am late to the game to make this a viable career option.  Note that by next spring, I will hopefully have my Ph.D. (BIG emphasis on hopefully!!!) as well as continuing my current employment (working here for 10 years with pretty much a career set).  However, I keep considering just moving from this all and getting into VFX as a new career.  Just for more info, I'm 30+ and pretty much single (no major relationships that would be jeopardized by a sudden career change on my part).

PHew...that was a lot to say (and more than I've really told anyone).  My questions are really:

1)  Is there a chance for me to break into this field at all, or is the industry so saturated that someone like me could never have a chance (assuming I would have to take some schooling and such, which would add to my age when starting out).

2)  Is there some materials (mainly books) out there that are considered the ""tomes"" of the VFX world?  I'm not really looking for software specific books (I've had to learn a LOT of software in my life, so learning something new isn't major) but more fundamentals (what the hell is a node workflow?!?!)

3)  What fields are particularly in demand in the VFX area?

4)  What general advice, information, thoughts, can you give?

Any advice is greatly appreciated!  Also note that I am a first time redditor, so please excuse any lack of ""rediquette"" that I may have. :)"	t5_2qhfw	True

1272250155.0	bw1ea	Programmatic control over mirror ball reflections.. Ideas?	quaternion	4	0	1	"A friend gave me a disco ball - which I wasn't very excited about until I realized yesterday that I could hang it in the center of my room and aim my projector at it from above. This gives me programmable control over what the discoball is reflecting (I can project different moving objects onto it), where it is reflecting this image (basically, by projecting onto different portions of the ball's surface, I can change the location of the reflections), and how much it is reflecting (by decreasing the size of the projected image I can hit less of the discoball's surface, until only a single point is reflected off the disco ball).

My question for you all: what else might I do to create trippy visuals with this setup? I had a few ideas:

1) Mount a prism or mirror somewhere in the room, so that I can use the projector to illuminate the discoball from multiple different angles, with all the same control I have in illuminating it from the central location.

2) is there something I might do with a fresnel lens?

3) Construct my own discoball made up of convex mirrors, which will reduce ""dead spots"" on the wall where no light is reflected by the discoball. Unfortunately I can only find 2"" diameter circular convex mirrors, which would not tesselate on a reasonably-sized spherical surface very well (&lt;24"" in diameter).  But perhaps this wouldn't matter, given the convexity...

4) It seems with a perfect sphere mirror ball and the appropriate math (polar to coordinate mapping, I think?) that I could actually project an aspect-ratio-conserved image anywhere on the room by hitting different parts of the sphere.  Any ideas for what math/software I might need for this?

Edit: I'm wondering whether I might be able to do something like [this](http://vimeo.com/2063601) (skip ahead to 1:10) with the smooth mirror ball."	t5_2qhfw	True

I started playing around with some alien / human models and they were fine. Both with UVs and with ptex.
But then I came up against this little gun-turret model supplied by Digital Tutors and for some reason, the paint-buffer can't apply paint to the surface of the model correctly. See evidence:

http://imgur.com/ZCR3Sd2

The artifacts are actually painted onto the geo in real space, it's not a drawing issue.
Now, I thought to begin with that maybe it was a problem with the UVs. I checked them out, in Mari and in Maya. Seemingly no problems with them.
I then thought perhaps it was some bug with the geometry, so I imported the OBJ files into Maya, combined the three separate meshes that constitute the model into one mesh, then re-exported it as a single OBJ file. I then took this OBJ into Mari and still, same problem.
