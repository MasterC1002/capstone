1329250060.0	ppjyp	It's been a rough year.. And today found this hanging on my door	Its-Georgie	139	6	39	"This hasn't been the best year.. My group of friends has been shrinking, I've been struggling in school, and hormone therapy has eroded the emotional control I had just finished cultivating. I managed to smash my phone recently ($180 to replace) when I'm already bleeding money into hormones and laser and voice therapy and clothes and starting to run out. To top it all off, my relationship with my girlfriend ended horribly a few weeks ago - she hit me at a party and I immediately broke it off in front of 30 people.

Needless to say, I haven't been feeling fantastic about myself. 

So yesterday, my little brother brought some friends home, and I had the luck to walk into the kitchen while they were having a conversation about faggots and trannies and how gross it is to see two guys hold hands. Within a minute I was crying in my room; I must have been there in bed for four hours, crying and sleeping on and off.

When my mom got home that night, I tried to wipe the tears away and be happy and talk with her.. and I couldn't do it, I felt so awful. I ended up crying to her and telling her about how awful things have been lately. She hugged me and told me it would be alright and tried to make me feel better...

So today's Valentine's Day. I woke up and found this on my door.

Genderestimate	152	24	21	"I've been on testosterone for over a decade now and many people that know me wouldn't even guess I've ever been anything but male. With many people, I like to keep it that way (with the exception of family, close friends, and my girlfriend for obvious reasons). 

This evening, however, my inlaws stopped by for a surprise visit. As soon as I heard the door knock, I scrambled out of bed to get dressed and greet them. When I get off of work, I usually go straight to sleep after stripping down (TMI, sorry). Being the great housekeeper I am, my clothes usually end up in a pile next to the bed until morning with my packer nicely situated in my underwear. In the rush to get to the door, I quick put on a pair of shorts and a t-shirt, leaving all undergarments in my room.

Once downstairs, I invited Mr. and Mrs. into the living room for a cup of coffee. We began chatting about this and that. Her mother and I usually spend at least 5 minutes talking about how wonderful her daughter is while her father rolls his eyes.
This time, though, the conversation didn't make it quite that far. I was in the midst of listening to her dad talk about his latest business ventures when my yellow lab-something mix ran into the room. Thinking she had a toy in her mouth, my girlfriend's mother extended her hand and said, ""Come here, girl! Lemme throw that for you."" I don't think I need to say what Sadie had in her mouth. *-shudder-*

TL;DR Girlfriend's parents came over, dog gave her mom the D.

1325015280.0	nslho	A quick little Trans-mas story about how I stood up to the one family member everyone else seems to be afraid of.		123	12	22	"So I have this aunt that is kind of greedy- she loves making money (and she doesn't care who she has to lie to and walk all over to get it) In my opinion she's slightly a sociopath but nobody stands up to her because she brings in all the cash so the family can go a vacations and do nice things and such. Anyhow this aunt of mine has only seen me twice in my entire life before my transition (I moved closer to my fam after I was full-time) So because I was so far away growing up, my greedy aunt, my uncle(who's really awesome), and my cousins have really only known me for the most part as female. Since I've moved here everyone has been awesome with pronouns except my aunt... and although she says she's accepting, I get the vibe she just says she's cool with transsexuality just to look good in front of the rest of the family who has no problem, and is accepting of it.

So X-mas day one of the gifts all of of received form my uncle was this really cool calendar that him and some of the faculty at his school put together to bring awareness to gender minorities- while organizing this he told he colleagues he wanted to be involved because he has a niece who is trans (me) and he thought it was a good cause. So X-mas day goes on and my aunt misgendered and ungendered me over and over again... but I kept my cool- didn't say anything.... Finally at one point I was sitting alone and my aunt came up to me with the calendar and said ""Can you believe your uncle was involved in this calendar- I can't."" I replied ""Of course I can, he's been the most supportive and accepting family member in this house!"" then she got defensive saying ""I've been accepting- are you saying I haven't been accepting?!?!"" (I know the nerve right?) and this is where I knock her right on her ass saying ""No. you constantly misgender me, you've brought up my nose job in front of everyone five times, and you have this general hostility towards me... Now I really don't care what you see me as in your head, you think I'm a guy that's fine. But out of pure respect could you please not call he/him or use my birth name ever again- it's insulting and you know it, so quit it.""

There was a moment of silence and then she changed the subject, then found another family member to annoy. We didn't speak to each other for the rest of the day but she hugged me goodbye when it was time to leave. Hopefully I made a difference in her thinking.

anyhow if you've read this far thank you, I'm kind of proud of myself and just wanted to share. thanks again."	t5_2qxpm	True

Today they came home (we're all here for Christmas) and they had gift bags for my mom, sisters and sister-in-law from Bed, Bath and Beyond with feminine lotion/body wash. Afterward they took me aside and gave me one as well, with a card and everything just like I was one of their other sisters. It seems so silly that it matterd to me so much, but I just feel really grateful and happy right now and wanted to share. "	t5_2qxpm	True

1327541554.0	owxcy	Came out to my Employers and Father on the same day...(MtF)	sarahchii	104	8	34	"Tuesday morning, I had no intentions on coming out to anyone. Being fairly sure I would be fired for attempting to come out at work, enjoying having my insurance provided at work (as it pays fully for therapy and HRT), and unwillingness to risk it all until it was a requirement and backup plans could be formulated, it was just supposed to be a normal day. 

And it was up until after lunch. 

One of my friends who works near I work decided to take me out to Steak and Shake to talk about some unrelated business. After lunch he dropped me off and I walked back to my station. As I walked back, one of my co-workers came up to me and decided to bug me about random things. Work related, non-work related, why the freakin' sky was blue. Just everything. He does this shit constantly, so much that he actually caused fist-fights with other former employees (after throwing the first punch). Can't be fired, since he's related to the owners of the company (nepotism at its finest). Not to mention that up until that day I had always tried to be on his good side, since he had seen me out with a group of friends as my true self.

However back to the details.

After being showered with questions about everything under the sun for a good 10-15 minutes, my rage got the better of me and I quite firmly and politely informed him to ""shut the hell up and let me get back to work"". Catching what I had said, and knowing that physical fights with this employee had broken out for less, I knew I was in for it. I lucked out though, only causing a verbal confrontation with him in a yelling match that lasted a good 20 minutes. At the climax I exclaimed ""I quit"" and walked up front.

Nearly in tears, shaking I walked towards the front door of the building, where I was greeted by my boss who took me into his office. I explained the situation to him and laid everything out on the table. My keys, key card, the entire list of administrative passwords. Everything. He told me to think about what I was doing and if I really wanted to let this situation play out like this. 

At that point, my mind raced immediately to the employee knowing about my identity. The company I work for is really ass backwards so them finding out about that, I thought, could make them not want me as an employee anymore, since I had clients who were highly valuable to the company and might not be accepting of this information either. 

I had planned on going full time by the end of the year anyways, and I didn't want to have it be told and get fired for an ""Unrelated issue"". So I told my boss. I told my boss about my identity, the therapy, what my plans were, what my plans were after my transition, and how I felt it would affect the company. 

Nothing was really said to me, but he called his wife in, who happens to be HR/Payroll/Receptionist/Co-owner. He asked me to repeat what I had told him, so I did. At that point I was dismissed for the day and I went home.

I went home and cried for a good 2 hours, thinking I had just lost my HRT, Therapy and my Job. 

About 5PM rolls around and my Dad shows up unexpectedly. I look like shit in a handbasket, with a puffy face, bloodshot eyes and tear soaked hoodie. So when I opened my door, he knew something was up. I sat him down on the couch and as I began to tell him I think I lost my job I start crying.

My dad is one of those guys that are ""Boys don't cry"" and all rough and macho. Eats nails and tacks for breakfast, y'know. That type.

So he starts in about being a man and taking responsibility. At that point I stop him and say ""I have no problem taking responsibility, but I am *not* a man."" and I proceed to tell him the events of why I thought I was going to be fired and about transitioning.

I had never been so belittled in my life. Starting in with the ""My son will not be some man in a dress"" and going on about how I was some sissy bitch to him now, that I was dead to him, he stormed out of my apartment.

More Crying. And then I passed out in my closet.

The next day, no one said anything to me. Nothing happend, it was quiet.

I show up to work today, and my boss's wife hands me a file containing all the information for new hires and tax forms. She then tells me about how she had a friend who went through the same situation and she would personally see that whatever I needed I got help with. ""The forms are for when you're ready to come out full time, so we'll need all your new information."" She was really amazing about it and after work we spent an hour talking about different things. Was the first time I actually got to know her.

Then My Dad came by after work (with my stepmom), and apologized.  He asked a bunch of questions about why I was transitioning (why I felt I needed to, was it something he did, if I was sure...etc.) and asked if he could go to therapy with me. I told him that I was pretty sure it was a private session only, but I could set up a family one or we could go to a group session. We hugged for the first time since I graduated the 6th grade (I'm 22). My stepmom hugged me and said that they had talked to the rest of the family, and even though they personally ready to see me transition, the rest of my family was awaiting seeing me (little did they know that almost everyone else knew already, but...).

And that was that. They just left. And I'm still here.

**TL;DR**: Shit hit the fan at work, felt forced to come out so I did; More shit hit the fan, got sent home early;cried, Manly-Man Dad came over and discovered me crying, told to man up; Come out to Dad, diarrhea is now being sprayed from metaphorical fan, cry more. Nothing happens following day, then everything is all better the day afterwards.

***Still* TL;DR**: I came out to Dad and Boss, it was bad. Now its all better."	t5_2qxpm	True

1360500410.0	188tjw	The 'RadFem' movement should be classified as a hate group	groovemastergeneral	120	30	124	"Last year, the Southern Poverty Law Center rightly classified the men's rights movement as a hate group. However, they are yet to turn their attention to another insidious group - RadFems.

For the past couple of years, RadFems have lead the way in using the internet as tool to incite hatred against transgendered people.

Indeed, there are now dozens of RadFem websites devoted precisely to this purpose - with 'RadicalHub' and 'GenderTredner' arguably being the worst offenders.

As time passes, their rhetoric and activism are becoming increasing aggressive - with some of them even going so far as to 'out' transgendered people without their consent.

Disturbingly, some of the most prominent RadFems are even being given platforms to spread their transphobic bigotry in mainstream publications. Take for example, Julie Burchill's recent Observer article.

Thus, I believe the time has come for us to persuade the Southern Poverty Law Center to recognise RadFems as the hate group they truly are.

I have to say, my initial foray outside was frightening. I really was scared, so much so I just kind of looked ahead and kept walking. The more I relaxed, though, the more I realized how incredibly *normal* it felt. I started to smile. By the time I got to the psychiatrist's, I was feeling pretty good. I've been in a cloud of depression lately, and I know this is going to sound cliché, but the colors were *brighter*, and the sounds were *sharper!!*

The appointment went *very* well. Of course I've told him about being transgender, but I've always presented somewhere in-between male and female. Today though, I was Andrea---not even Andy anymore! As we sat down, he slipped a ""Good day sir"" to me, and I was more than happy to say, ""Not sir, Dr. -----!"" Then he looked up and saw me, and he actually smiled. He saw that I was actually happy, pretty much the first time he's seen me like this. We talked about conquering fears, and how normal it felt for me, and he expressed his full support. A few more months, and he should be ready to write an endocrinologist letter!

Now to the things I found most interesting about the experience. A couple months ago I was talking to a transgirl friend of mine, and while discussing bathrooms I had the weird idea that it would somehow be exhilarating to use the girls' room. Today I realized how absolutely stupid that is. ***It just felt normal!*** Just walking around as a girl felt ***so normal!*** I didn't feel as weird about the feminine mannerisms I've been using for so long now, probably in part because I had padded boobs in, styled hair, and respectable makeup on. It wasn't an act at all---it was ***ME***, and it was ***normal.*** :-D

I did get three double-takes; one from a guy asking for a cigarette, and two from random guys next to me on street corners while waiting for the light to change. They weren't even looking at my face, they were glancing absently at my boobs. *sigh* I guess guys just do that, and I'm going to have to get used to it eventually.

Even though I felt safe today, I think it might be wise to invest in some mace (hopefully just for show). But all in all, It was an INCREDIBLE experience just being myself for once! For any of y'all who are still nervous or scared about venturing out as yourself, while I still advise some caution, you won't *believe* the experience once you finally do it.

Thank you for all your support, r/transgender! I hope to stick around here for some time now!

PS. My parents were remarkably cool about it when I got home. We talked for a while, but everything was fine. My mom's even taking me to get my ears pierced this weekend, and hopefully to buy a bra of my own so I don't have to steal hers anymore.

**tl;dr** Went out as 100% girl for the first time ever today. It was splendid and felt remarkably normal. I smiled the whole time typing this up. :)"	t5_2qxpm	True

1. Intimidate the mods into reversing their policy 

2. Lie to the LGBT community as to exactly what happened to start a witchunt.

3. Compared labeling trolls as trolls to the atrocities committed in nazi germany and engaged in various other logical fallacies in an attempt to provoke emotional reactions.

Make no mistake the main people responsible for this attempt have in their comments defending their positions engaged in transphobic and bigoted behavior, one stated that cisgendered people have a right to determine what is and isnt transphobia, another called us all ""delusional men in dresses"" and yet another implied that since the word transphobia was not in the dictionary they used, that it did not even exist.

What I would ask of you is to subscribe to [/r/lgbt](/r/lgbt) if you are not already and post about transgender issues and things there as well as here, basically anything you would want to post here please crosspost there as well. Make our presence known in the subreddit and let rmuser and SilentAgony know that we are grateful for them trying to make their sub a safer space for us.

Edit: downvote harder [/r/gaymers](/r/gaymers) so you can prove me right, keep trying to silence transgender voices in our own subreddit.

So a quick story that I thought I would share:
Last week I went to a local art show, I was standing by a photograph, admiring the work.  It was lovely.  After a few minutes of taking it all in a very beautiful girl came up to me, she was the artist who took the picture.  Her and I talked about it for a few minutes, she was bright, insightful, polite and all kinds of good people.  I could tell she was trans but extremely passable; we can usually smell our own.  So then a little boy came over, he must have been 7 or 8 years old, he was adorable and had the same facial features as the artist.  She introduced him as her son.  It turns out she was in a relationship years ago, had a child, transitioned and she is now his mother.  They had an amazing connection, she was affectionate, loving, attentive and there was no doubt she was his mother.  I think it is amazing and I'm a little envious, this is an opportunity that most girls like us do not get.  I hope she understands how fortunate she is.....

tl;dr met a transgirl who transitioned early to be her son's mother."	t5_2qxpm	True

1276841806.0	cgavl	So I had the best interview ever today.	eternalkerri	57	4	6	"Two months ago I lost my job.  Long story, won't get into it.

Well, I transitioned full time two years ago.  I haven't legally changed my name because I live a bit of a away from my family and can hide this part of my life from them (long story about conservative families, inheritances and such.  Cliff notes version: Granny will die soon, with Southern Baptist aunt left to control estate without a will, won't see a dime, lots of drama, blah blah blah.  When Granny dies, no ties left to extended family, I'll change my name and move on.)  I do have a gender neutral name though, so I can slide on those merits.

Well, anyway.  For two months I have had hell finding a job.  I live in Oklahoma, which is pretty damn conservative.  Well, out of about 300 applications I have had maybe 5 interviews.  It's been really hard finding a job to say the least.  So I decided to bite the bullet and de-transition so I can find a job to make some money to move to a more liberal area with more LGBT friendly businesses.

Well, I had applied with a company about 6 weeks ago, but they canceled the job requisition.  I had already done the phone interview with the HR person.  It went really well and I was confident of getting the job, but of course it went away.  I revised their site and found that they were hiring again so I re-applied....  This time as a boy.

Well, I get the call from the HR person today for the position.  I introduce myself as a boy and she pauses for a second and says, ""Well, I thought this was Amanda.""  I proceed to explain that she is my roommate and its just this really really odd coincidence that we have almost the same name and are roomies.  Yeah, clearly when I was saying this, I hadn't thought it through.  She expresses disappointment that she wasn't going to be re-interviewing Amanda. I grit my teeth but move on.

She proceeds to start trying to build me a new profile in her HR system but can't because of similar emails and the fact that we ""share a phone number"" (yeah really, we share a cell phone...I really didn't think this through), I know I'm about to blow the whole interview if I keep this up, so I confess.

""Hey, um...let me be honest.  I'm Amanda.  You see I'm transgendered, and I have had a horrible time trying to find work these past two months, so I have started applying for jobs as a guy again so I don't loose my house, my car, and stuff.  I know its horrible to lie in a job interview, but I was getting desperate, and I really want to get back to work.  I am so sorry.""

There is a pause for a second and she says, ""Oh, so you're Amanda?""

""Yeah, I mean, I live in Oklahoma which is very conservative, and I'm really sorry.""

""Oh don't worry about it, I understand.""

""Really?""

""This is 2010, who cares as long as you can work.  Anyway, that spares me the effort of trying to figure out how to create a new profile online.  So I just need to ask you the new questions specific to this job.""

""So, It's ok?""

""Oh its fine, I was getting sad anyway, I really liked Amanda, and was disappointed at first it wasn't her.""


After I aced the phone interview questions in ten minutes, (and switched back to girl voice...I can still switch back and forth really easily), we talked for 30 minutes about being trans, workplace diversity, how good the company is with diversity, being a woman in the workplace, how hard it is to find a job in IT as a woman.  I then realized...we were just bullshitting for 30 minutes in casual conversation.

NO MORE. I am sick of it. I'm sick of being so full of rage, anger, and malice. I care not to waste any more time on it.

I read an interesting quote I'd like to share:

*Love what is.*

*Not what you want.*

Well, I want to be a cis girl, but that isn't ever going to happen. I am trans no matter what I do, and loving what is forces one to not pay attention to loving what you want, but finding the positives in the present tense and learning to love them.

So today and for the rest of my life, I care to be full of love, compassion, and empathy. Because what's the point of getting to be who you are if all you are full of is negative emotions as a result?

Love what is my trans brothers and sisters. Work towards what you want, but don't fret if you don't get it. You're still thee most courageous and awesome of people to be met. =)"	t5_2qxpm	True

They've had a grand total of 1 meeting under their belt. 1 person came to it. No print materials, no policies and procedures.  Nothing. 

Meanwhile a group that has been running consistently for nearly 4 years, a group that has had consistent attendance of 10+ people, a group that has run special events consistently with little to no budget, etc is viewed as unfundable. Of course, this group is the trans group, so this double standard is perfectly ok. 

I've asked for funding dozens of times, all have been rejected save for some small stuff like $8 for candles for TDOR. I've funded it out of my own pocket for the majority of that time, bringing snacks, printing materials and even running the group when I was homeless, eating ketchup soup at mcdonalds to make sure I had enough money to pay for gas to drive to our centre and open it up.

I am so disappointed. I'm on the board and I feel so powerless. It seems the only thing we give a fuck about is happy fun gay events. Pride? Fuck yeah, let's dedicate pretty much all of our disposable income to that! (Fun fact, this new group is the only real competitor for that money) 

I also got shit at our meeting for not changing my name legally, with accusatory glares as to why the tranny hasn't changed its name yet. It's because I'm broke, you privileged fucks who want for nothing. I feel so utterly unsupported, to the point where it's causing me significant problems with my mental health. FML"	t5_2qxpm	True

She talked me into coming tonight so I could tell him, and so she wouldn't haven't to hold the secret in for all the time. 

I came out to my Father, I guess I don't feel like calling him Dad anymore. And I guess that in itself already tells you how it went. 

He didn't get violent, he didn't yell, he didn't do anything. He just stood there and was quiet for the longest time. And when I finally stopped babbling and sat there unable to look him in the eye, he finally spoke. 

He told me I was confused, that I was letting a moralless society drive me down a forsaken path. That I was listening to evil council, That I had no right to do what I was doing. How was it fair for me to do this when men their whole lives just lived with those thoughts. Hah, Lived with them. I guess he didn't understand the part about how I had a gun in my mouth when I was just ""Living"" with those thoughts. 

He tried to negate all the positive changes that have gone on in my life, and in the end the last thing he said to me was ""I don't think I can be comfortable with this. I don't know how this will affect our relationship."" I told him I didn't know either, but that was up to him, as I was not going to remove him from my life unless that is what he wanted. I got up and headed towards the door. He asked me if I was leaving I said yes, and he never responded. 

He didn't say goodbye, He didn't try and stop me from leaving, He didn't do anything. 

Afterwards when I got back to my office, [I updated my male facebook] (http://www.facebook.com/midgardzolom/posts/313255945385420) and then sent friend invites to the few friends on my male facebook who were not on my female one.

In all, it feels great, I no longer have a weight on my shoulders, I'm not hiding anymore. 

I never planned to go stealth, I never planned to be anything but who I am. I'm proud of who I am, of my transgender self, and my lifestyle. So I have no intentions of hiding it.

1322597951.0	mtq7k	Let's try this.	blueblank	49	1	14	"I know the NSFW thing has been an issue for a while, and people dislike that self.posting is forbidden. Just looking at the initial survey results I can guess where they are going (and we can always revert later). We need to keep things lively around here before we pass out from inactivity.

So, from now until the end of the year the 'no self posting' and 'no NSFW' restrictions are lifted. So post away. But wait...

A few ground rules:

  - self posting that falls under the domain of /r/asktransgender will be moderated and you will be asked to repost. There is a true separation of concerns from a moderation and readership POV.

  - nsfw doesn't mean 'anything goes'. This is still not a porn subreddit. Off-topic nsfw links will be moderated.

We can reevaluate at the end of the year whether this is successful and should be extended. 

Comment here, or /r/metatransgender which will still remain open to discuss transreddit experience and existence."	t5_2qxpm	True
