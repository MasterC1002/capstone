1349912074.0	11a2t0	Amazing heatless curl tutorial. Actually worked for me.	itsmeaud	226	21	67	"I was able to get these  http://i.imgur.com/T9r9A.jpg awesome curls to hold for two days using the ""cocoon method.""

I've been using this heatless curls tutorial for a while now http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAPHSAPshJE and I cannot believe it works so well. You basically take damp hair, separate into 1-2 inch sections and twist it into a cocoon. In the video, she doesn't sleep in the cocoons, but I'll tell you what I did differently.

1. She sprayed her hair with only water. I used a mixture of water and Lotta Body Setting Lotion (the kind women used to use in the 1920s-50s.) This product is amazing. I could post a whole review on this stuff. I had springy curls for 2 full days, with absolutely no sagging or wilting, which is amaaaazing for my fine flat hair. They would have lasted longer, but I had to shower.

2. She tucks the hair into small little pods she calls cocoons and lets them hang, free falling. I secured mine by jamming a few bobby pins up through the bottom. This allowed me to sleep in them.

3. She lets hers dry for 3-5 hours during the day, while I slept in mine. They were more comfortable than pincurls or ragcurls.

Why this shit isn't exploding on Pinterest I have no idea, because it blows the sock bun out of the water.

I had to share this secret. Don't get frustrated. I had to practice for like 30 minutes before I got one to stay.

**Edit: I'm happy to keep answering questions. If you're having trouble getting it to stay, consider tucking the end into the cocoon and using at least 3 bobby pins. And please post pics of your results!**"	t5_2sa9a	True

My hair used to be a source of extreme embarrassment for me. Between the ages of 10 and 22, I refused to leave my house if my hair wasn't completely straightened. I avoided pools and rain like the water was acid. My best friends growing up had no idea my hair was naturally curly, and I didn't even tell my husband until a year into our relationship. I often cried thinking about how easy everybody else had it. Take a shower? Straight hair! Humidity? Straight hair! Roll out of bed? Straight hair! I spent hours every day in an attempt to have beautiful, silky-smooth hair. I hoped eventually my hair would get the hint and do what I wanted it to do like everybody else's did. Spoiler alert: it didn't.

[Here is what my every day straight hair looked like.](http://imgur.com/uGZSc)

So one day, I decided to allow my hair to dry naturally and took my dog on a walk. It was a huge step for me. I even [took a photo](http://imgur.com/Tn8LJ). Upon viewing said photo, I was reminded why I spend so many hours every day straightening it into submission. I didn't wear my hair naturally again after that day for a few more years.

Fast forward to January 2012. At almost 23 years old, I still hadn't embraced my hair. The prospect of someday accepting my hair the way it is seemed so foreign, and straightening my hair had always been a part of my lifestyle. It wasn't until a friend told me to check out [naturallycurly.com](http://naturallycurly.com) that I decided to open my mind a bit. I spent hours immersing myself in this community. I learned what kind of hair I had, what products would be best for it, and how to best treat my hair. I read blogs, watched videos, and read countless message boards. I finally came upon a thread of people's before and after photos, and I quickly realized that the reason my hair sucked so bad wasn't because I had sucky hair. It was because I had no idea how to care for it!

It has been nine months into this journey of loving my natural self. My hair looked awful for the first month or two, but I had read over and over that it will look worse before it looks better. So I held out. And the craziest thing happened: I started getting complimented. Lots of compliments. More compliments than I could keep up with. And, get this, people told me that *they* envied *my* hair. It was surreal. I haven't looked back since that day in January when I decided to suck it up and love myself. My $200 straightener is collecting dust in the cabinet, and I couldn't be more thrilled. 

And without further ado, [here I am today](http://i.imgur.com/YG0RXJ1.jpg) (note: I update this photo every so often so that you can see my recent hair from using the following routine). It's like I have a different head of hair up there! Taking care of it the right way has transformed my dry, frizzy mop of waves into voluminous and defined curls! Read on to see how I did it.

**MY ROUTINE**

So I get asked about my routine on FF a lot. I want to encourage you curlies out there that your hair doesn't have to be a burden or chore and that, even if your hair is dry and frizzy and lifeless now, it doesn't have to be that way. Let me also be clear that this is the routine that works for *me*. It won't be fool proof for everybody, but I hope this can be a jumping off point for those of you who have no idea how to care for your curls!

The biggest no-no's:

* NO brushes. Ever. Throw all of your damn brushes away and don't look back. The only acceptable way of detangling your hair is to run your fingers through it in the shower or comb it with a wide tooth comb in the shower (or right afterwards when your hair is still very wet). Also, use lots of conditioner while doing so. I keep a wide tooth comb (I use [this one](http://www.ouidad.com/Double-Detangler) - expensive but soo worth it!) in the shower and it doesn't leave the shower at any point.

* Use shampoo without sulfates or silicones. They will strip your hair of your natural oils and keep it looking dry and damaged. I recommend [DevaCurl No-Poo](http://www.amazon.com/Deva-Curl-DevaCurl-No-Poo-12-0/dp/B000HIYE0M/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349082949&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=no+poo) and [Ouidad Daily Shampoo](http://www.ouidad.com/Clear-And-Gentle-Shampoo). Also, use whatever shampoo you have very sparingly. I only shampoo once a week, but use conditioner almost daily (this is called co-washing).

* You know that towel you dry off with? Yeah, don't use that on your hair. The [little loops](http://imgur.com/3Dkiy) in a standard terrycloth towel will snag your hair, making it frizzy. Instead, use a microfiber towel or a cotton t shirt, as these are gentler fabrics.

Here is my routine from beginning to end:

While in the shower, I shampoo (if necessary) and then load my hair with conditioner. My all time favorite conditioner is [Jessicurl's Too Shea](http://www.amazon.com/Too-Shea-Island-Fantasy-32oz/dp/B006OP2MLU/ref=sr_1_2?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349083361&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=too+shea+jessicurl+island). I bought a whole gallon of it last week because I use a ton and love it so much. I also really like [Devacurl One Condition](http://www.amazon.com/Deva-Creamy-Conditioner-Condition-32-Ounces/dp/B000TK99NU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349083506&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=devacurl). I allow the conditioner to sit in my hair while I shave, bathe, and wash my face. Once I'm all done with the rest of my routine, I *gently* comb my hair and lightly rinse out the conditioner. If my hair is being extra dry, I'll then add a little more of my conditioner as a leave on conditioner/detangler.

When I'm all done, I dry my hair by flipping my hair upside down and gently squeezing excess water out with a cotton t-shirt. I don't ""wring"" my hair out, I fold it into the t-shirt like an accordion from the tips to the roots. Leave a bit of water in so that it's not soaking wet, but you could still get more water out if you wanted to. Your hair needs the extra moisture.

And now onto the products! 

I apply my products very generously. I have used so many different kinds and like them all for different reasons. I am currently using [Ouidad Climate Control Gel](http://www.amazon.com/Ouidad-Climate-Control-Humidity-Unisex/dp/B0001Y74VS/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349084062&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=ouidad+climate+control) and/or [AG Re:Coil Curl Activator](http://www.amazon.com/AG-Recoil-Curl-Activator-12oz/dp/B005EHRTSA/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349084110&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=AG+RE+COIL), depending on whatever is closest to me at the moment. If your hair needs lots of moisture, [Kinky Curly Knot Today](http://www.amazon.com/Kinky-Curly-Knot-Today-Conditioner/dp/B00128WK4I/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349084218&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=kinky+curly) is a great leave in conditioner.

When applying hair products, split your hair up into sections and gently apply a generous amount to each section by scrunching the product in from the bottom up. Treat your hair like a very fragile accordion.

I like to immediately diffuse my hair for about 5 minutes, hanging my hair upside down and again scrunching the hair upwards like an accordion. I diffuse it right away to aide in creating volume on top. There is nothing worse than flat curls at the top of your head (aka the dreaded [triangle hair](http://imgur.com/Yq1gc)). Then, I clip the top half of my hair up so that the rest can dry naturally with lots of volume.

After this point, don't touch your hair. Leave it alone! The more you touch it, the more frizz you'll get! 

My last bit of advice: Get your hair cut by somebody who specializes in cutting curly hair, or is trained properly to do so. I recently used [this](http://www.ouidad.com/salon_locator/idx_salon_lookup.asp?quicksearch=1&amp;searchradius=100) search engine to find a man that gave me the best haircut of my life. [Here](http://www.mydevacurl.com/curly_stylist_finder) you can find more stylists in your area that are curly hair specialists. 

So there you have it. I will probably cry if nobody reads this because I spent the last hour and a half compiling all of my knowledge on the subject. I am just really love it when people embrace their natural hair, and I know what it's like to be totally clueless.

1372814083.0	1hjcfb	[Modpost] A review of subreddit policy. Please upvote for visibility.	smbtuckma	187	25	27	"Hi all, 

This reminder has been overdue for a while now, but we’re prompted to post this now by [a particular picture from last night and the response it generated](http://www.reddit.com/r/FancyFollicles/comments/1hg36q/when_i_get_lazy_i_walk_around_campus_with_my_hair/).

The issue at hand is that the majority of comments in that post are physical, sexual, or romantic in nature, which we typically do not tolerate on this sub. This place is for hair, not for telling people how good-looking they are. Because of this policy, we have gone through and deleted comments we deemed inappropriate, even if their intent was good. 

Our usual policy is also to count deleted comments towards a user’s ban strike number. Three strikes, and you’re outta here. However, we did not penalize anyone now because there are some grey areas in this case and some vagueness of policy on our part. One could argue that the comments about OP’s level of attractiveness is applicable to his question, whereas it is not to most posts. There is also the greater issue that hair is closely connected with physical appearance, and so sometimes it is difficult to isolate these topics in this subreddit. If a couple of these appear on a post and aren’t especially explicit, we usually let them slide because their aggregate effect is not offensive or uncomfortable. Dozens and dozens of these sorts of comments do have that effect for some people, however, and we don’t want to gamble with our users’ perceptions of what is unwelcoming and even harmful. Thirdly, our policy on comments as posted in the sidebar says that no bullying or inappropriate comments will be tolerated, but that was not specific enough in this case. We are going to clarify that language, as well as make some other subreddit adjustments, in the near future so that people will be more aware about what is and isn’t expected here. 

So to summarize this particular issue, this place is not for sexual or romantic attention. While you may say, “you’re gorgeous!!” with the best of intentions, this space is not designed for that sort of commentary. Please refrain from commenting anything that does not pertain directly to a poster’s question or their hair. One post like this may not seem so bad, but we are not about to set a precedent that may result in a greater unwelcoming environment, for any gender.  

As a final note, this subreddit is getting big – it’s nearly twice as big as the entire town I live in. It is easy for large subreddits to spiral out of control very quickly if we (the mods) aren’t as informed as possible about the experiences of our users and their desires for this sub. Therefor, we request that you take a few seconds to message us about your opinions about this issue as well as general thoughts about things you like, dislike, and want for this subreddit. It’s all about you and your strands, after all!

Thank you guys for listening, reporting, and discussing with us,

Your mod team,
Teatoly, smbtuckma, and girlietrex.

I am a cosmetic chemist that specializes in hair care products. I have been a consultant for 5 different cosmetics companies and know all the intricacies of everything from simple shampoos to those expensive hair straightening treatments. 

I will be around (on and off since I am in my lab) all day and will answer every question as best I can.

Edit: I need to log an experiment for a bit but will be back by noon PST. I promise I will get to every question!

Edit 2: I have to head out for a little bit but I shall return to answer all the other questions. Thanks guys, and keep them coming!"	t5_2sa9a	True
