1350292578.0	11i6e5	R/milwaukee this is what happened to me tonight		202	23	86	"I've been through/experienced a lot of fucked things in my life, but this is definitely up there. I get off work and decide to wait for the bus instead of biking home. While waiting at the bus stop I notice there is a crew of municipal workers hanging a braided-steel cable from lampposts, and it crosses the street- presumably to hang xmas wreaths/lights over the intersection. A bus approaches the intersection, and no one signals for it to stop, so it California rolls through, and in doing so snagged the cable. This cable was also somehow wrapped around one of the worker's legs. He was dragged about ten feet before the cable sinched tight and took his leg off, leaving him with severe contusions to the head and a severed limb. I sprinted over as I yelled for his dazed coworkers to call an ambulance. I immediately monkey-grip his severed limb at the thigh to delay his arterial hemorrhaging, as his leg(from the knee down) lay in the street four feet from me. The paramedics came 2 mins later and took over, saying he's lucky I squeezed his artery or else death would've been eminent. I stood up from a pool of blood, got my bottle of southern comfort out of my back pack and took a long pull as I waited for detectives to arrive. End result: The guy lived(barring an anomaly) and is going to get a HUGE settlement from the city... And hopefully his leg reattached.

Edit: I just happened to have some southern comfort with me, I don't drink at work and hadn't drank anything until after the incident.

I might be imagining things, but it even smelled nicer in your city.

I was watching Shawshank Redemption and got to the part where he writes a letter a week to the Government, asking for funding a library.

Then it hit me...  We should write a letter to Google.  I call it the ""Dufresne Effect"".

I propose we type up a formal letter, and mail it once a week to Google.  The sheer volume of awesome cannot be resisted forever!

Body of letter ideas:

- Should give the current situation of Milwaukee.  This is that competition is good.

- Show how it would benefit both Google and Milwaukee. (Jobs, businesses, etc.)

- We have better beer (because why not?)

Every restaurant, every bar, and other spots I've checked out have been really cool and had a great atmosphere. I haven't been disappointed. The Oriental Theater is really a treasure. The river and the lake are wonderful to jog by. It's pretty laid back, and I haven't really run into any shitty people so far. So far I've been mostly limited to downtown and the east side / brady street area.

So excited I could puke.

They found it abandoned on N 5th St off MLK Dr. Nothing was broken, everything works, and the DUMBEST things were stolen from it. Its a given that they wouldve stolen my stereo from my dash, which is fine, it wasnt anything special. Plus I already bought a new one and installed it today. Thankfully they didnt cut any wires, break anything, or screw with anything. They also stole my Honda manual, a case of burned CDs that are all about 10 years old and didnt even belong to me, an empty dollar store address book, and two $4 water floaty chairs from Walmart this summer. They left the $500 cowboy boots I forgot I had in there, my new rainboots, ALL of my ACTUAL modern, popular CDs (there had to have been like 20). That stereo had to have been worth MAYBE $50, and the CDs were garbage. 

So all in all, good job dude, not.

No one knows who did it, and frankly, I cant even bring myself to care about that at this point. Im just too jacked I got my car back. 

FUCK YEAH (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻

_______________________________________________________________________

My car was stolen last night. From outside the federal building downtown on Wells St and 3rd St. from metered parking spot 4880 between the hours of 3PM and 9PM while I was at work. I cant even believe someone stole an ENTIRE car. My mind is blown in every way.

So some jerkoff in Milwaukee has my dark green (almost black), Honda Accord, Michigan plate BBS6239. It is four door, has a rear fin, and a sunroof fin on top, tan leather interior. Three windows (not passenger window) and rear windshield are slightly tinted.

I would do anything to get it back.

1343611957.0	xd9l0	We had an absolutely wonderful time in your fair city. 	Jrrtubbs	54	4	32	"Hey there Milwaukee redditors. 

I just wanted to let you know that my wife and I really enjoyed the crap out of your city. Here's a brief overview of what we did. 

We got into town around 11 and went straight to Discovery World. It was a totally enjoyable little museum and we loved petting the Stingrays and Sharks. The science side was also fun but a lot of stuff didn't seem to work. It was delightfully uncrowded though. A Saturday late morning/early afternoon at the Museum of Science and Industry or the Shedd would've been a madhouse and I mean that in a good way. 

After that we decided to hit Sobelman's for lunch. I'm not going to lie to you, we were let down. It was a fine burger and the price was right, but I was told to expect my face to be fucked and for my dick to fall off and neither of those things happened. My wife's dick is also firmly intact and her face remains unfucked. 

After lunch we went to Collector's Edge South. I was glad I did a little research because I was hunting for a couple of specific (and not necessarily rare, but hard to find in the last 3 weeks) and this is where the back issues are apparently kept. So I told the guy the books I was looking at and he had them immediately. We made some small talk and he told me a little bit about the store and then offered to take me to the basement to see the back issue stock. He said there was over a million books down there. It was awesome. I asked him the rarest thing he though he had down there and he took me into a locked room called the vault and showed me a Detective Comics 38. For those who don't collect, this is the first appearance of Robin in a Batman comic and is work about 40 grand in mint condition. This was graded 1 out of 10 in condition and still cost 3,500 dollars. I got a serious nerd boner holding it. 

Books in tow we drove to the Bronze Fonz and snapped a quick photo. As we were walking back, I noticed International Exports and knew it was the Safe House. I was curious so we went through the whole shpeil to get in and had a drink at the bar. The bartender gave us some recommendations for things to see and we left. 

We tried to go to the Brady Street fair but we couldn't find any place to park and it just wasn't worth driving around looking any longer than we did. We went to Alterra on the Lake for some coffee and read for a little while and then we went to the Third Ward. 

We walked around the Public Market for a bit and then walked around the Third Ward trying to decide where to have dinner. We wound up at the Smoke House and it was amazing. The second best BBQ I've had in my entire life (Slow's BBQ in my hometown of Detroit is the best). I wanted to have the whiskey ice cream, but my wife had her heart set on Leon's Custard (her family used to go there when they would pass through Milwaukee on trips). I bet whiskey ice cream was good, but holy shit that was some good custard. Face covered in chocolate, we headed back home. 

Here's a photo of us at the Bronze Fonz. Maybe you saw us, but probably not. http://i.imgur.com/RYkk1.jpg

TL;DR Milwaukee is fun. It was just what we needed after a long, stressful week. Sobelman's was just ok. Smoke House BBQ is amazing. Collector's Edge sends blood to my nerd dick. "	t5_2r7dt	True

He asked if she was married, and she told him yes, and then she excused herself from the conversation went about her business of entering the store and going grocery shopping. 

When she finished shopping, she left the store, and headed to her car, when she began to realize this male was following her. 

THe groceries were dropped and something broke, and she went back in the store to replace the item that broke. When she was in the store, she told employees that she wanted to be walked to her car (which they did) and she realized the man was still following her.  

Since she didn't want this stranger to know what car was hers, they went back into the store.  This man then went into his car and circled the lot multiple times and appeared to be waiting for her to come out. They got the description of the car and the plates, and called the police.  

Eventually the police came, but the creeper left before the police got there. The plates were ran, and they are plates that belong on a semi truck.

I just wanted to put this advisory out there, because it has not been in the news. It just happened a few days ago to somebody I know. 

edit: I don't know what the car model was, and I wont be able to find out for a few more days. It may have been a rust colored honda.  Also, the man had a very unique accent, and did not sound like he was from south eastern wisconsin at all. Sounded like he may originally have been from another country."	t5_2r7dt	True

1340062750.0	v8zkw	/r/Milwaukee June 23rd Meetup - Final Organizing Thread	tsondie21	49	4	74	"Hello Everyone.

All discussion about the planning of the meetup is going to end here. We need to stamp out these details or this isn't going to happen. I have read all the comments and have made a couple of decisions based on them and we are going to go with that.

~~1. **We need a permit**. We are planning on Lake Park. We have a little over fifty people RSVP'd but that was opened long ago. I think we can assume we will have a little less than fifty. If not, we can just say that we had more people than we thought. The permit is going to cost $85 and someone is going to have to front the money. I have said before that I cannot do it at this time. I am in a weird limbo place with my finances and I would love to but cant. The day of the meetup, we will have people contribute 2-3 dollars each and pay back the person fronting the money. This probably needs to be done by tomorrow so we can make sure we get a spot. If Lake Park is already full, we can look to other parks as central as possible.~~

2.  This event will be BYOB. We will be mixing minors and adults and we just don't want it to get messy. 

3. This event will be a pot luck. I will try and bring a grill/charcoal. Barbwirebird has also offered to bring grills/charcoal. EVERYONE ELSE NEEDS TO BRING SOMETHING FOR PEOPLE TO EAT. Everyone doesn't need to bring something for fifty people to eat, but a couple bags of chips or a couple packages of brats or homemade cookies or what have you. 

~~4. There are a couple things that we need to make sure we have but aren't general food items. I am going to assume the general food items will all even out. These items are: Plates/napkins, Condiments.~~

If you want to give people an idea of what you are bringing, please do so in the comments. Also we need volunteers for plates/napkins/condiments and the permit. Mainly the permit.


EDIT: The Time IS NOON

We will be at Site #5 at  Lake Park. [A map can be found here](http://county.milwaukee.gov/ImageLibrary/Groups/cntyParks/maps/Lake1.pdf).

The permit was taken care of by a member of our community and all is well in the world. See you Saturday!

1351529664.0	12a76n	Hey r/Milwaukee, just wanted to say thank you, we spent a wonderful weekend in your beautiful city per your recommendations.	wuzzup	39	0	8	"Last week I created a [post asking for new places](http://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/120vpj/looking_for_new_fooddrink_spots_in_milwaukee_all/) to hit and you guys really came through. 

On Friday, we decided we were in the mood for some tapas so we went to La Merenda and were very impressed. The food was exquisite and the atmosphere was delightful. The portions were a little larger than typical (for our understanding of tapas), and slightly more pricey but nevertheless they were great. Thereafter, we jumped in a cab and headed further south down to Sugar Maple. Obviously a great selection of Craft beers in addition to beautiful large bar. I kind of wish the staff was more knowledgeable but we were able to compensate by just ordering nearly everything on the menu.  We really made it a point to try all of the regional local breweries throughout the weekend and were very impressed. 

On Saturday, we spent the day walking around downtown and along the lakefront visiting the exhibits at the Calatrava and popped into the Harbor House for lunch. The clam selection was really great and the martinis were delicious (highly recommending the salted caramel). After that we met up with some friends by hitting up the lakefront brewery, we missed out on the brewtour (oh well) but had a couple rounds and were impressed. Then went over to the Rumpus Room for a handful more local crafts and some fine bourbons. 

Since we were planning to go to a show at the Riverside and wanted to watch the Notre Dame game, we though it would be best to hit an Irish bar in the vicinity of the theater to pregame and get some food. We headed over to Mo's only to be turned away and redirected to the side door for what was going to be a $50 cover at 7:15 on a Saturday. No thanks. Went over to Rock Bottom for a quick bite, a view of the game and a couple beers. Decent. Then went on to enjoy a wonderful show at the Riverside. Great beer selection, super strong mixed cocktails and a very laid back staff. They also had Oskar Blues Dales cans available. 

That's about it, if we had more time I would have liked to have head further up N River Street for all of the recommended locations. There's always next time. Which will hopefully be sooner than later. 

Again, thanks and a special thank you to [tsondie21](http://www.reddit.com/user/tsondie21) for the elaborate list of suggestions. Most everyone in town was very cordial and kind, and your city is beautiful.

A friend and former coworker of mine, Allison, has been living and working in Milwaukee for a long time now. She is the single mother of 2 awesome kids, and is a self-employed defense attorney. In addition, she has taught LSAT classes in Milwaukee to help send local students to law school. Her entire life, she has gone out of her way to help those around her.

However, like Carl Sagan and Roald Dahl, she has been battling [myelodysplastic syndrome.](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/myelodysplastic/Patient/page1) It is a rare blood disorder that potentially develops into leukemia. MDS is already hard enough to go through. Practicing law is also difficult, even when one is completely healthy. Due to her symptoms, Allison's practice is down to a a quarter of what it once was and she is unable to obtain insurance until 2014. She has applied to every possible assistance program, but is still unable to pay for her treatment.

This holiday season, if you can spare even just a few dollars, Allison, her family, and her friends would appreciate it. Any help that we can provide her will go to her treatment, so she can get back to dedicating her time and energy to helping others. If you would like to help, she is raising funds here at http://www.indiegogo.com/allison-ritter?c=home

At this point we are just still exploring the idea, and have created a survey to get some feedback. I am not asking for money, and the survey is completely anonymous. We are just trying to find out if there is enough interest for us to invest the time/money into something like this. We would greatly appreciate any opinions -- both positive AND negative.

Here is the link to the survey: http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22DF858PYRA

Please don't x-post this in /r/gaming. While I love playing with gamers from all over the world, they aren't going to come to our bar, so we are looking for feedback from local people. If you want to share the link with other local friends, please feel free. 

Even if you don't respond to the survey, thank you so much for taking the time to read this far! :)

EDIT: Thanks for all of the awesome feedback both here and on the survey. I was a bit nervous posting about this on here as I wasn't sure if people were going to take me seriously -- but you guys rock. All of the feedback in the survey will be used to help with our business plan and to secure funding. Thank you.

MOAR EDITING! Someone on the survey was a banker involved in lending that raised a few concerns. I am not sure if that person was a Redditor or not. If you are, and you see this, please PM me -- I'm not hitting you up for money, but I have a few questions about the business lending process that might help us overcome some objections. Thanks!

VERY LATE EDIT: A few posts have popped up in the MKE subreddit from someone else with a similar idea -- which is fine, competition is good -- but just wanted to clarify that I am not posting under multiple names to drum up support. Different guy, different idea. We are still talking to publishers to figure out licensing costs; need to see if this is even feasible."	t5_2r7dt	True

I 24/m just moved back to Milwaukee(lived here for 3 years) after 3 years in Madison doing my post grad. Unfortunately many of my good friends from here have moved off to different cities while I was gone, and while I still have many good friends here I feel like branching out and meeting new peeps! Feel free to bring friends and I can bring mine! I have a settlers of Catan board game which is pretty fun and I would be happy to bring a 6 pack of beer and maybe go play in a park or a bar or a whatever. Just a laid back dude looking to meet a few new people, let me know if your interested :)

EDIT: Estabrook beer garden would be a really easy place to do this!

EDIT 2: It appears a lot of people like Catan and and beer...so much so that one board probably wont due, perhaps just bring whatever game you want, I will be bringing catan, and we can split off and play! We can try to pick a date and time using the poll below this week, Thursday and friday appears to be the only day sans thunderstorms! 


[Link to a poll to vote on a time! Winning time decides and we will close it Wednesday night.](http://kwiksurveys.com/app/showpoll.asp?qid=176045&amp;sid=kj4ofaxamtfsd3b176045&amp;new=True)

EDIT 3: Friday at 7 pm is the winner, see ya all at estabrook, I was just there to disc golf today and it looks nice as ever at the beer garden. I will get there to save tables, Ill be the one with the catan board game! Looking forward to meeting you all :)

EDIT 4: **As it looks like it may rain (just like every other day) The contingency plan is to meet at the Red Dot on Bradford and bartlett( one block west of oakland and bradford.), its a mile south and there is usually room. Otherwise shoot for estabrook park, I will have a black Wisconsin cut off and white hat., see ya there!** "	t5_2r7dt	True

You found a wrench almost magically behind the counter for me to use. I was able to fix my wiper while my wife and daughter raided your store for snacks. I bought your last hot dog. It was by far one of the best hot dogs I've had, ever. I give a fuck how old it was. 

You seemed cool, almost like you might be a Redditor, so on the off chance you are; Thank you... sincerely.

How does a meetup for /r/milwaukee and /r/brewers sound on Monday, August 13, to watch the Brewers game on TV?  Game time is 7.40 PM.  

My personal favorite Milwaukee sports bar is Tracks -- http://www.trackstavernmilwaukee.com 

The first pint of beer (or non-alcoholic beverage) for every redditor who can make it will be provided courtesy of reddit, and we'll buy some appetizers as well.  

Fried cheese curds, pints of Lakefront brew and good company anyone?  Let me know what you think?

1328739831.0	pgw21	Thanks r/milwaukee! Thanks to your suggestions, I had a great anniversary in your fine city.	lucasandrew	34	4	28	"So, a short backstory. My wife and I have been married for two years as of yesterday and up until recently were living in Tulsa, OK. We got the chance to move to Freeport, IL to do some work on a house for my father-in-law, after which we're going to move to Chicago. For our anniversary, since it was following a move that cost us more than we expected, we decided to go somewhere within driving distance. It didn't take us long to decide on Milwaukee after reading the ""I'm visiting MKE, What should I do/eat/see?"" thread linked on the right. So, here's my honest opinion of the places we checked out while we were there from an outsider's point of view.

We stayed at a La Quinta on North Port Washington Road, but spent most of our time in the middle of the city (at least geographically). The first night we were there, we decided to go check out Conejito's after all of the recommendations I've seen on here. It was fucking awesome. We ate so much fucking food and had margaritas and left with a tab in the low $20s.

That night we went to Y Not II to check out that bar (again as recommended). It was pretty cool. We had a couple of liters before decided to drive around some more, which is when we went to Brady St.

Holy shit. Maybe a weekend night wasn't the best night to check out Brady Street, but we ended up at Thurman's ""15"", which was a pretty cool bar. The bartender, Bob, was really cool and gave us some suggestions for other things to check out in town.

Sunday, we ended up going to Comet cafe, which was a great place to have an early beertini and some pretty amazing breakfast food during their brunch.

After Comet, we went to the public market, which is fucking great if you enjoy markets/wine/cheese/cooking/spices/etc. It was smaller than I thought it would be but still had everything I could want from a market. I had some fresh-roasted coffee, bought some Wisconsin cheese and took it across the walkway to the wine bar where we had some flights.

From the market, we went to Oakland Gyros, which was pretty good. Don't expect the veggie gyros to be gyros though. They're a greek salad in pita, which is fucking awesome nonetheless, but not what I was expecting.

We decided to check out Water Street next and ended up in one bar (I forget the name) that had an overwhelming smell of what might have been stale beer. It was enough that we didn't stick around to order anything because it was just far too pungent of a smell. That led us a little further down the street to Trinity Three Irish Bar, which had all the feel of a suburbian restaurant in my opinion. I'm not picky about looks and feels of bars so much or the ""authenticity"" like most people, but I do appreciate a cool crowd. That's not what we had. I felt so out of place there. The bar staff was great, friendly, and I have no complaints about them at all. It was just the fist-pumping patrons. (I shit you not, there was fist-pumping while we were there.)

Our last day there, we went to The King And I Thai for lunch and had their buffet, which had some of the best curry I've ever had, and for only $8.50 for each person.

We then went on to do the Lakefront brewery tour, which was one of the highest suggestions I saw on here, and I can now vouch for. On our way out to get the extra free pint, we asked the girl at the counter which of the bars she's recommend for a couple of out-of-towners about to drive back to Illinois and she suggested Wolki's.

Wolski's was a great bar to go to. The family/divy feel was great and is something I've really been missing since I moved away from all of my home bars in Tulsa.

After Wolski's, we went to Conejito's one more time to get some tacos and some margaritas and headed back for 3 hours of driving. I guess I would have to sum up my experience as this: badass. Milwaukee is going to be a place we visit pretty often, especially once we move to Chicago, because parts have a great city vibe but you can still find parking.

**tl;dr**
Went to Milwaukee for a few days, visited the following places mostly based on your suggestions, and thought these things about said places:

Conejito's - Fucking great and surprisingly cheap

Y Not II - Not bad. Good deals on the liter mugs of beer

Thurman's ""15"" - Pretty cool bar. Bob, the bartender, was great

Comet Cafe - Great brunch early in the morning

Public Market - Wine and cheese. What else can I say?

Oakland Gyros - Pretty damn good salad on pita

Trinity Three - Fist pumping. Not my favorite place

The King and I - Great Thai lunch buffet

Lakefront Brewery - Awesome tour with cool people working there

Wolski's - Favorite bar so far in Milwaukee

Conejito's again - More good, cheap food before I drove 3 hours home

I'll be back... a lot."	t5_2r7dt	True

Should we start a direct donation fund with an accompanying name directly to Freodtert?

I'm not huge into salads at all so I would probably only keep one head of lettuce. It feels weird even doing this but I do not want all these veggies.

If you're interested there is also some:

* Jalapenos

* Green peppers

* Yellow peppers

* Avocados

* Carrots

* A bag and a half of [Jamaica flowers](http://www.101cookbooks.com/archives/000172.html)(NOT WEED)

* Also a lot of beer. Not really willing to give this away, maybe we can trade if you present something that I fancy. Like, say for example, a beautiful painting of an owl, [mantling over its prey](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_me5z27mipd1qi2nxpo1_1280.jpg).

Pm me, I will give up the lettuce... but may ask for some greenbacks for the other stuff.


Edit: By other stuff I meant the beer. However if you want all of the veggies, at least give me ten dollars. There's plenty of avo's and peppers and Jamaica flowers, which makes a delicious tea. I think it's a good deal. Come at me bros.

Edit II: All the veggies are gone. Last night I came home trashed with some buddies of mine and we started eating some of the random vegetables that were left over (some one came and took everything else). My friend ate 4 avocados straight and them chased them down with tequila because ""it's mexican food"", then he projectile vomited the foulest onto National ave.

Needless to say, with my ""city smarts"" being limited to ""fear everything"" and with the crazy mob thing in Riverwest, I'm a little scared.

Highlights include wondering about the writing style Tolkein uses (is it too conversational or just right?  who was the audience?) and the fact that each of the races seemed to be pretty flat and that personality was determined by race.

This month we are looking to tackle American God's by Neil Gaiman.  We plan to meet on July 31st, the last Tuesday in the month around 6pm.  I will talk to Boswell Books to see if we are welcome there again.  Hope to see you guys there."	t5_2r7dt	True

She is rather skittish so she may not come to you but she isn't aggressive. She is just over two years old and weighs 6-8lbs, she's tiny but lanky, not chipped, no collar, still has claws front and back, has all her vaccinations. 

I live by Capitol and Oakland and normally she sticks around the house when she does get out but not this time. She's been having a hard time adjusting to living with two other cats (roommates) which she has never done before.

If you see her please PM me and I'll shoot you my number. Honestly, even if you find her dead I'd like to know.

I had this white girl being condescending and outright nasty while my I set-up a beer pong game.  I told her to leave us alone and if she wants to talk shit, then go do it out of earshot.  I don't know how, but somehow she managed to start playing beer pong for the opposing team.  I was extremely offended and told her she needs to leave.  I said, ""I paid for the beer in this game.  I do not want you playing with us.""  She got the hint and left.  My friends and I continued playing.  The next thing I know, I get tapped on the shoulder by security telling me to leave.  I asked him what was wrong and he just said that I needed to leave.  I asked if someone complained and I pointed out the complainee and he didn't even look and told me that I needed to go for being belligerent.  I didn't want to cause a scene so I gathered up my shit and left.  I was escorted outside and couldn't fathom what just happened; white girl complains and the brown guy gets ousted.  I have NEVER had this happen.  The bouncer takes her word over mine and even though I had people backing me up, he didn't want to hear it.  I was told after it happened that it's just Wisconsin...white people's word will have more umphff any day than my own.  I became really sad and upset that this happened.  My friends told me to brush it off but it still bothered me.   I'm not going to be going to Dukes ever again...effing ridiculous.  I just needed to vent.

 I am going to start off by letting you know that I am a liberal who is outraged/upset about the recent stuff going on in Wisconsin politics. I say this for full disclosure and to let you know that I am biased towards it.  

No matter what my stance is on the issue, however, I am not going to be removing posts about these issues just as I wouldn't remove posts about a Tea Party protest that might happen if the democrats passed some sort of universal healthcare in Wisconsin/Milwaukee.  

The fact of the matter is that this subreddit currently stands at 405 people.  To compartmentalize that into some sort of politics subreddit would be ridiculous. From what I have seen, most of the political posts have been very specific to Milwaukee (such as talking about protest places and the like).  If we start to get more general and broad with the political posts, that is when I might step in, but for now things seem to be under control.  

There is a downvote button for a reason and with a community this small, posts like this will be self-regulated for now.  "	t5_2r7dt	True

1371843505.0	1gtavc	TIL about the fascinating story of the North Avenue Dam	prodigy904	28	3	6	"Turns out that there used to be a dam right where the current pedestrian bridge is, just south of the North Avenue bridge.  In 1835, a timber dam was built in this location to divert water into a canal that would eventually connect to the Rock River near Janesville (early Milwaukeeans expected this to link the Erie Canal to the Great Lakes to the Mississippi, but funds ran out and only about 1 mile of the canal was ever built - where modern day Commerce Street is).  


The timber dam washed away in the 1860's then in 1891 the city built a more permanent dam to control flooding and provide energy for mills, tanneries, factories and breweries.  This created a large recreation area for swimming and boating just north of the dam.  You can see from the photo how high the water actually was.


The dam stuck around until 1997 when it was removed.  I've lived in Milwaukee since 1984, and I didn't know any of this until today.  It's amazing.

I decided that the best way to determine the answer was to make a list of potential best burger establishments and systematically test them out.  So, after searching the 'net a bit, I've established my trial list to be the following places:

* Dr. Dawg
* Solly's
* Skippy's
* Matty's
* Oscar's Pub &amp; Grill
* Stack'd

About a year or so ago I started a side project involving urban hiking/exploration in Milwaukee. I've been gradually expanding my little operation to invite others to join me on my expeditions. 

Basically we start from one point of the city and make our way to the other side or more often than not we loop our way back to our start  point. Along the way I find graffiti, abandoned buildings, hidden shops/food vendors, and anything that really catches my camera's eye. 

If you ever needed an excuse to explore the city here it is! 

I have three hikes lined up every other week. The first one is this saturday (July 13th) and is dedicated to exploring Milwaukee's south side. All are welcome and details below.

1366156958.0	1chxga	Planning to return to Milwaukee to live after a decade away (currently in NYC). How has Milwaukee changed in recent years?	NYCtoMKE	29	9	55	"I lived in Milwaukee a decade ago, when I was in my early 20s. Since leaving, I’ve gone to grad school and lived in several large cities including Minneapolis, Chicago, and New York (where I’ve been for almost six years). Of all the places I’ve lived, I liked Milwaukee the best.

But I need to GTFO of New York. It’s just too much of everything -- too big, too aggressive, too expensive, too constantly aspirant, too exhausting in its tedious fashionability, too sure of itself. What I liked about Milwaukee is that it was large enough to be interesting and adequately cultured, but small enough to feel “knowable” and accessible and down to earth. Not to mention, it’s way more affordable. I miss the East Side, Downtown, Bay View, Riverwest. I miss riding the 30 and 15 buses (I know, right?). I miss going to Brewers games. The lack of pretense. The fact that it’s dense but not over-dense. And lots of other things. So I want to come back.

I left Milwaukee not because I disliked it but because I thought I was taking the obvious next steps to bigger and allegedly better places in life. It’s true that I improved my education and broadened my experiences, but now it’s time to return to a city that feels like a good fit.

So now I am wondering, because I have only been able to visit briefly in the interim: how has Milwaukee changed over the last decade? I’ve been seeing a lot of positives in my research, like a planned streetcar (they really do wonders to spur development!), some revitalization of the former Pabst zone, the new train station and Harley museum, and what seems like a reversal or at least stoppage of the population decline that has plagued other Great Lakes cities. Oh, and I see that Walker’s Point is now being called the “Fifth Ward” -- it’s comforting to know that greedy real estate agents are the same everywhere...they always want to rename neighborhoods to sell more condos...

Anyway, fair Milwaukeeans, tell me what is new and great and what it still the same. Or if there is bad news (other than Scott Walker being governor), let me know about that, too.

tl;dr - I want to leave New York and come back to Milwaukee after a decade away. What should I know?

[Note: This is a throwaway because some of my coworkers are on reddit, and I don’t want folks to know yet about my intent to leave.]"	t5_2r7dt	True

It will be at McKinley Park on Milwaukee's lakefront from 11am-5pm. It will be free to come but there will be plenty of things to do (ranging from Lure Courses to Dog Nutritionists to Face Painting for kids). Food and drinks will be available for purchase for the humans, while the pooches drink for free. We're still working out the finer details into the website, but it should be up in a couple of days so check back soon!

All proceeds will be donated to the Dogs Deserve Better charity cause which is Central Barks charity of the year. DDB is dedicated to buying and transforming Michael Vicks old dog fighting property into a Good Newz Rehab center. We just want to take the negative reputation the property has into something positive and inspiring for everyone and every dog. Our goal is to raise $30,000 by the end of this year and we want to surpass that goal with this festival. So feel free to tell your friends, family, and neighbors about this, **EVERYONE IS WELCOME**.

I will be volunteering during this event, as we are looking for more volunteers. Unfortunately, the only downside of volunteering is that you can not have your dog with you as some people may be helping to direct traffic or will be working with food. You can, however, let someone you trust handle your dog. So if anyone is interested in volunteering, feel free PM me and I can set this up and give you more details.

Now if anyone else would like to find out more about anything, message me or you can call my work( Central Bark Doggy Day Care - Mequon) at 262-512-9663 and ask for Nicole, Amy, or Becca.

Hope to see everyone there!"	t5_2r7dt	True

I'm an outgoing guy and like to strike up conversation with random people from time to time.  Are people very receptive to that?  Also, jobs.  I've worked strictly in call centers since I was 18.  I don't have a college degree.  Any suggestions on that front?  Also, just any general things that I should do or not do to make the transition easier?  Thanks in advance.

Edit:  Thanks so far for the quick and informative responses.  Since everyone's being generous with the info.  What are some things I should do when I first get out there to make me fall in love with the city?

Edit 2:  I will know exactly 2 people when I get there so if anybody is down for a ""Welcome to Milwaukee"" beer, hit me up!

Edit 3:  Thank you everyone for all the great information.  It is truly appreciated and you've all eased my apprehension about moving so far away quite a bit.

Open concept living room and kitchen (a nice kitchen with an island/breakfast bar). Your bedroom would likely be the one off the living room, it's of good size, my guess about 15x15 with a closet running the entire width of the room, sliding mirrored doors.  There is another bedroom upstairs that has access to a huge unfinished attic.  There is a laundry room shared with the neighboring apartment off of a mudroom that's big enough to accommodate a couple of bikes. Outside of that is the only 2nd floor deck on Brady St. with a picnic table and a place for a grill.  I need to find someone asap or I'm going to have to give this great opportunity up.  Rent is 925 split 2 (most likely... open to ideas, maybe) ways + utilities.  No Pets.  Open to male or female roommates, prefer social/active, respectful types and obviously someone for whom the rent will be in your budget comfortably. If you or someone you know might be looking for a place like this let me know. The previous tenants have lived there 8 years, it's a keeper- help me hold on to the nicest apartment I'll probably ever have in Milwaukee!

A little about me- I'm a guy in my late twenties, active- I do a lot of biking year round.  I enjoy cooking and I'm an omnivore although I don't discriminate when it comes to food and personal tastes.  I enjoy the occasional beer, and living on Brady St. with a deck you know I'll be up for beers and cookouts up there. That being said the days of parties and empties laying all over the place passed me by long ago, I'm moving OUT of riverwest, interpret that however you like.  I do work late nights on the weekends during the summer and fall (I drive a Pedicab) but I don't come home and make a bunch of noise or bang around in the kitchen.  I also work days at the Pabst/Riverside in their box-office, so if you like concerts I can get the occasional hook-up. 

PM me and we can grab coffee or a beer or something and see if we've a fit.  

TLDR: apartment available on Brady St. Aug 1 $925+ utilities.  Big Bedrooms, Deck, Laundry, ample attic/closet/storage space. No pets.  Need to find someone soon or I'll have to give it up.   "	t5_2r7dt	True

I would primarily like to say that anything really expensive is off the list.  We both make decent money, but not a whole lot.  I've already shelled out a few hundred for hotel &amp; travel, so I'm trying to limit myself to about $600 for the 3 days we are there.

She's a video game nerd chick, and I'm a dork with a penchant for rock music and good times.

Hopefully the weather is good and we can walk outside a lot by the lakefront, but I know cabs are going to be very necessary.....

So yeah......any help would be cool.  I'm mainly going there for a good time, but admittedly I'm also trying to impress my lady.

1369005203.0	1enqu1	Summer at the Lakefront - Some Advice	djlawman	32	11	13	"Now, I do not claim to be an expert on manners, but I feel that some of our fellow Milwaukee citizens could use a few tips on manners when spending a summer day down on the lakefront.  As an eastsider for seven years now, I have come to love heading down to the lakefront on a nice summer day, for a run, to bike, to play volleyball, or a combination of these things.  Today while biking down the path from the north end of Lincoln Memorial to the Summerfest grounds, I noticed a few things that irked me and wanted to share.  Please feel free to add to the list.

1) If you are on Bradford Beach, or anywhere along the lakefront really, please throw away your trash and food.  There was litter everywhere, beer cans left in the sand, and food in the sand that was attracting seagulls to where people were trying to lay out and play volleyball.  It is depressing enough that we have this big beautiful lake that no one in their right mind should swim in thanks to pollution, lets try to keep the beach clean, alright?

2) If you are walking down the sidewalk, please pay attention to where you are going.  I am well aware that bikers, runners, walkers, etc., all have to share the same path, but it gets old having to stop completely at times because people will step right in my path on my bike without even looking.  I certainly know that this is the cost of trying to bike on the lakefront, but I don't think bikers should take full responsibility for the safety of others.

3) If you are a biker, respect the walkers and don't go flying past them, you give the rest of us a bad name when you almost run over small children.

4) If you are walking with a small child that isn't old enough to look around and be careful for themselves, hold their hand.  It is far too dangerous with all the people walking, running, biking, and car traffic to just let your kids walk along without supervision.

Long story short we had a fan come out to our last show in Portage WI (the drive from Milwaukee was pretty long and most of it was back roads) he was nice enough help us move some gear in his car as well as drive our guitarist to the show. Unfortunately he hit a deer on the way and caused pretty considerable damage to his car.

As a way to help him pay for the damage to his car i told him i would put our CD's up on band camp for a lower price and give him what ever profits we make for the next two months.

You can listen to both of our albums in their entirety (in lossless format) on the site also btw, thanks a lot guys and please pass this on to any one else who might be interested in power / traditional metal

What sort of city is Milwaukee like? I know it's not as dense or big as :gulp: Chicago, but how walkable is the city? Can I survive in the non winter months using my bike? I've been to a few cities (mostly in the southwest, but still) that you could never get away without a car for more than a day or two.

Money is tight and what I have left, I'm going to use it to get back to New Mexico.  I wish I could stay longer and keep trying but that's not possible.  I was staying with my aunt down in Bay View for the time being, but now I am not anymore.  My aunt and her partner are alcoholics that are no fun to be around.  I tried to just deal with it since it's a free place to stay.  But it got to the point of being unbearable when they started focusing their anger/frustrations on me.  I left Tuesday night and have been lying low sleeping in the backseat of my car here and there.  I promised someone I would take them to a doctor's appointment this coming Tuesday.  After I take him to his appointment, I think I'm gonna hit the road and drive back to New Mexico.  I do have another interview coming up, but even if I did get it, I don't know how I'll get by until then.  Most likely, I'll just have to chalk this attempt at a new beginning as a fail.  Cheers X(

Edit:  I'm heading out now.  The drive from Chicago to St. Louis is awful.  I'm gonna go through Des Moines, Kansas City, Wichita, Oklahoma City, Amarillo (Big Texas Steak house for lunch/dinner), Albuquerque, and then home by tomorrow night.

I LOVE beer, I love going to micro breweries. I am also way into food - be it the most eccentric or the most basic. So PLEASE recommend the best breweries and sandwich shops and restaurants to check out.

Also, I love going out to bars and the clubbing scene at home, but since I'm COMPLETELY alone here, I'm not quite sure if that will translate on this trip.

Are people in Milwaukee friendly? Are there areas I shouldn't go to? Things to avoid?

Help me love your city, guys :-)

I'm a broke student, so I want to live in the cheaper areas near UWM, namely Riverwest or possibly near Brady.  My max rent is $400, but below $350 is preferred.  I'm cool with living with two other people as long as there is enough space.  My current lease is up at the end of October, which is a really terrible time to find a place, so I can probably duck out a month early, and move in sometime in October.

I'm allergic to dogs, and possibly cats, so less critters would be preferred (though you can play with my tarantula).  I'd prefer not to live with people that are regular drinkers, but once in a while is cool.  It'd help if you're /r/psychonaut friendly, because I'm pretty weird."	t5_2r7dt	True

I really need mental help here, Milwaukee.  Suicide is on my mind all day and I feel like absolute shit. My body is in pain, but I think it's more emotional pain. I can't keep food down. I lock myself in my basement all day and I have family members worried about me. 

I have considered suicide many times because I feel my life is worthless and fucked up. 

Another problem with me is that I can't carry out my suicides. Everytime I decide I'm going to do it, I think about how badly it would hurt so many of my family members. I decided that I don't want to make a mess of my death, cause I don't want to make anyone else go mental over my suicide. 

I've came up with some great plans to make it look accidental, but I know they would still be hurt with me being gone.  The last thing I want to do is physically/mentally hurt my family. 

Maybe I'll try to get MORE help. 

I've been considering checking myself into a mental hospital.  This really hurts my pride and I don really want my family knowing. 

I hate hospitals. I've been in the ER 3 times in the last month from me blacking out due to my depression and anxiety. I hate getting and iv. I hate the hospital setting, and I hate even just visiting someone in the hospital. I get very anxious and tend to get dizzy easily. 

As my last attempt to salvage this shitty life, I'm looking for a mental hospital that I could be more comfortable in. Any recommendations would be nice.  Thanks Milwaukee.

The Tortoise Shell is a complete goofball. She acts like a dog. She will want to follow you around and help you with all of your projects. She loves hanging out on the couch or sitting in the window watching birds. She loves being scratching on her face.

The gray/white cat is your typical lap cat. She wants nothing more than to cuddle on your lap all day long. She is a bit more shy than the other one and will take a bit of time to warm up to a new home.

I've been offered a better job in the Milwaukee area.  Would you consider it a good move to make?  i.e. can I find a relatively safe neighborhood in the downtown area with lots of young-ish (25-35) people around?  Thanks!

And maybe to pre-empt some comments about leaving DC: Most people who visit here think it's awesome, and love riding the metro seeing the sites, etc.  And it's true.  But after about 2-3 months, reality sets in.  The traffic and cost of living are insane.  The Metro is always being serviced on the weekends making it unusable (30+ minute waits).  People are constantly moving in and out of the area, and everyone here is married to their jobs, making it hard to make lasting friendships.  Bonus: will never be able to afford a house here with a commute that won't destroy my soul.  The main upside is there are a lot of people my age around."	t5_2r7dt	True

I am decidedly an Eastsider having lived here for seven years, and after posting my last post I received a lot of good insight into what was good about the neighborhoods, bad, etc.  Since then I have looked at houses all around, including Bay View, Tosa, West Allis, Riverwest, the Eastside, Shorewood, Brookfield, and never in a million years did I expect that I would find the total package including quality of house, location, price, and rental market in Cudahy!

Long story short, I found an awesome house in Cudahy, and I am wondering if there is anyone out there with a strong opinion as to why I wouldn't want to move there?  It is just a couple blocks from the lake, great neighborhood.  I am not too worried about the move putting a cramp on my social life as I don't really hit it hard until bar time anymore, and the 15 bus or a cab would take me to and from anywhere I want to go with my friends up in Bay View or the Eastside.

* Beer

I think I can contribute pretty heavily towards the beer. The permit can be bought by someone and then everyone else can contribute to it. I can't buy it right now as I am traveling until mid june, but it would be nice if someone could step up and get that goin.

1. I'm a lesbian, and I'm used to hearing that the North is some safe haven. Is MKE pretty queer-friendly?
2. I just turned 21 and I'm still getting used to the liquor laws here -- can you buy beer/wine in grocery stores there? Are there state-owned liquor stores? How does that all work?
3. I'll be driving a lot, but I'm from a smaller town and I can't parallel park. Am I screwed?
4. Down here, it's all about football, but I see that baseball seems to be a big thing in MKE. Will I seem rude or weird if I'm not really into baseball?
5. Where can I get the best cheese?

When I go out camping I find serenity in isolation from the public.  What I don't like is being near RV's and listening to screaming kids.  I don't ~~need~~ want to be near bathroom facilities, potable water, or electricity.

My ideal camping spot would have 3 constituents: 1) on a river or lake, 2) hike at least a mile, and 3) be within 3 hours of Milwaukee.  I find that one mile is a perfect length to get away from people and I can still carry a cooler of beer.  I certainly wouldn't mind hiking further.

I'm a young student, so it needs to be cheap, and I need to be able to get in and out in time to catch my bus. I'm at a total loss right now; the internet has been less than helpful and apparently the bus depot is not in a cheap part of town. I am willing to crash on someone's floor, if you can offer me a ride to and from, and I'll pay you for the privilege.

For those nights where you want to have some intoxicated fun, but not just sit at a bar all night gossiping and listening to cover bands.

What are some bars/clubs in the Milwaukee area that a group of friends, or a date, can go to and enjoy a good time?

By activity bars, I'm referring to a joint that serves alcohol but is mostly the secondary reason you are there. The first reason is to share in an activity, such as sports or dancing (not club dancing).


My list is comprised of:

* SPIN Milwaukee - Ping pong

* Landmark Lanes - Bowling, billiards, steel-tip darts, &amp; arcade

* Comedy Sportz - Comedy shows

* Casablanca - Hookah

* Koz’s - Mini-bowling

* Splash Studio - Painting

* Olde German Beer Hall - Hammerschlagen (Hammer &amp; nail game)

 
Specific dates:

* Hot Water - Salsa dancing (Saturdays)

* Frank's Power Plant - Drink 'n draw (Fridays, scheduled by a 3rd-party individual)

Please share as many as you can think of, even if they are the same type of activities listed above. I'd like to have a couple places to reference when looking to have fun.
