1338911856.0	um840	Skrillex fans, new and old. Let us end this now.	TomLube	131	20	47	"I constantly get people inboxing me, talking to me, asking for new tracks and information and things like that, which is cool. But I also get a lot of people telling me that ""Don't you hate 'Skrillex fans' who only know 1 or 2 songs by him?"".

The answer is no. I would not, could not, cannot condone condemning people for only knowing 1 or 2 songs. Perhaps yes, some of them are out of arrogance, but the majority of people are new to the genre and the aggressiveness, the pointless aggressiveness towards newcomers of the genre is disgusting and in complete opposite movement of what Skrillex is trying to do by unifying people and bringing us together through music. 

If a person only likes or knows a song or two by Skrillex, so what? You started off that way as well, you didn't magically birth with an infinite knowledge of the man and his music. People are entitled to like the music that they like, and to go around saying that they like Skrillex because…… surprise! They do. 

It's not like being a fan of Skrillex is a particularly unique thing to be… the man himself has nearly 7 million likes on FaceBook. 

You don't have to have an 'ILL' tattoo or have the logo painted in your room; or wear Skrillex apparel; hell you don't even have to go to a Skrillex show. It's not a secret club, or underground group which you must know at least 100 songs Skrillex has produced to become a part of.

Is skrillex Leaving behind his old sound, or is he showing us a different side for a reason?

This wasn’t what I was expecting from skrillex’s new EP I won’t lie, the first quick listen I had, I was taken aback slightly, and was, confused as to what I was hearing. After SM&amp;NS I was hooked on skrillex’s signature sound, Bangarang was somewhat of a evolution of that sound, into a cleaner sexier form of his old style. The leaving EP feels to me like a sidestep from releases such as summit and goin’in (going down) and I mean that in the best possible way, now for a track by track.

The Reason:

Starting with a soft synth and voice sample, then that signature beat that skrill never fails to find, my head was already subconsciously bopping away the first time I listened too this. The track then develops building then dropping into a great headboper, conjuring very similar feelings too going down in my mind, the song builds again, and at the second drop, you get such a down and hard beat it’s astounding. Although this song might not be at a typical skrill tempo, its one of my favourite songs he has made now.

Scary Dolly Dub:

Since this is a “dj tool” as proclaimed by the great man himself, I will only talk about the part which is “new” ie not fucking die, or the sm&amp;ns parts, so pretty much the drop. It is no secret that this track was made some time ago, probally at the SM&amp;NS time, and you get that feeling from this track which is great in my opinion. I’ve had the pleasure of hearing this live, and it’s a great track to just rock the fuck out too, classic skrill, start to finish.

Leaving:

This track is very interesting, it took a good few listens for my to start enjoying it, it’s a long jump from skrillex’s normal sound, but once you listen too it, you can pickout his tried and tested techniques. If I had to compare it to any other artist it would be koan sound, something similar to their remix of A Team. With the smooth bass, and creative drums loops, this song is so chill its amazing. This song goes so well with the album art in my opinion, as I could 100% see myself listening to this, riding in a car though an empty tunnel, with some not so great stuff on my mind, and over the course to my dwelling on those thoughts, my mood begins to elevate, as with the song.


This EP feels like a more grown up skrillex, there feels like real emotion in leaving. The Reason feels is like how I take life, relaxed, but with 100% commitment, it drives forward, at a relaxed tempo. SBD, feels like a reflection too the past, letting us fans know that although we are experiencing an altogether more grown up sound, that old, let’s go hard as hell skrillex is still there! Lets hope we get another EP/album from big beat before march! 

I like this new progression skrillex has taken, and releasing through the nest was a great move, it means his hardcore fans can give their honest opinion on this style development. In my opinion, i want more of this, mixed with the occasional banger


Good People, Good Music, Good Times!

I've always liked techno, trance, Paul Oakenfold stuff like *Ready steady go*, and other types of dance music. I recently watched 'spring breakers' and was introduced to 'scary monsters and nice sprites'. Loved it immediately, then went for Bangarang and Equinox. Love those too. Looking for more skrillex that are comperable to those 3 songs. I love his style of music!

I have noticed a lot of hate towards him, I don't understand it. It's about his music, his looks, him leaving an older band, etc. I love what he does, gets me pumped, who gives a shit if its some dubstep, mixed with other generes of dance music, but not 'pure'. People are so eager to label something and make it an exact way and put it in a little neat box, but it doesn't have to be an exact way, art is subjective. Anyways, nice to see a subreddit developed for Sonny and I am a new fan!

As an aside, if anyone can lead me to more music, songs, artists with similar attributes, I'd love to take a listen. thanks!

It's like we are analyzing a book. Several times already this year I had to read a book and analyze it on different theories to explain what the author wrote and what it turley means. Sometimes I think ""Maybe s/he wanted to just write a damn book and not get critciezed saying that he is a Marxsits for writing this way or she is a feminist."" 

In this case, we are doing the same thing to Sonny. Sonny changes his name on Twitter from Skrillex to Sonny, and then some people were like ""OMG! NEW SONNY ALBUM!!! BELLS!!!"" I get it, we want that stuff, but maybe he wants people to know he has a name too. Or now, Sonny has dyed his hair red, and now everyone is saying ""Oh, he's leaving his Skrillex persona."" I'm not saying you are wrong, that is your opinion, and this rant is mine, but maybe he just wants to dye his hair red. I don't think girls in my school dye their hear from pink to orange because they want to be someone new, they just want a new color.

Overall, I think we should just let Sonny do his thing. Let him be his own man. I'm sure you won't want your next door neighbor watching everything you do and analyzing it. ""Oh, he just bought a hot dog...that must mean something."" You see what I mean? Yeah.

DafuqStonr	35	3	99	"I'm a huge fan and I find an appreciation for every Skrillex tune, and there aren't any that I would go ahead and say ""I hate/dislike"", but there are a few that I seem to never really listen to unless it comes on while I'm not attentively listening to my music. 

So, just out of curiosity I wanted to pose this question, what is a Skrillex tune that you guys and gals find that you usually just skip over in your playlist, think could've been better, or maybe you even actually think it ""sucks"". 

Personally, my least favourite Skrill tune is Right On Time. Not to say I hate it, because I've enjoyed it during commutes sometimes, but I usually skip that track when it comes on in most circumstances. Just not my kinda style I guess.

""Hey everybody!
  
So I've been collecting your emails over the last couple years on my Skrillex.com site, which still says it's under construction only because I haven't found the greatest need for it (yet).
 
I just wanted to write this message to tell you all that we have been working on a website called NESTHQ.com. The concept of the site is simple really... It is a window into this culture that we all share and have created together. This culture doesn't have a genre, It doesn't have a specific name but it's origins began with a global network of like minded people who love to share their passions for music and art . This site www.NestHQ.com is simply a window into this culture...Our culture.  This isn't just a Skrillex-centric or OWSLA centric site either. We really want to show and SHARE the passions we have for stuff that we like and that just makes us feel good. And that's what life is about.
 
To put it simple, NestHQ is a media platform with a basic mission: To showcase and share the stories of the people who are continually pushing musical and artistic boundaries within this culture.
 
 
On another note, the last two years has been an incredible journey and I couldn't thank you all enough to having a huge part in it. **I've got more music to share soon.**
 
Thank you friends! Hope you're all well :)
 
-Sonny""

This EP, although only 3 tracks, IS FUCKING AMAZING DEAR GOD. Bangarang was criticized for having ""choppy synths"", but this is far from that. I didn't mind the ""choppy synths"", I actually loved that. Skrill makes some kick ass hard dupstep songs (Please don't get incredibly anal about genre catagorizing, I can't stand that) and some chill songs, such as Summit. This EP was a little more of a ""chilled out"" EP, other than SBD but that's only 1/3 of the album. 
 
* SBD is a kick ass track. Although it has recycled components from Fucking Die and Scarry Monsters, it's still pretty kick ass. Its sound is similar enough to something like Jah No Partial (Mr. Marshall) or Make It Bun Them that it can be mixed in with them during live sets and sound like sex mixed with bass. It's a song I've been anticipating since it first came out and we were calling it ""Scarry Monsters and Nice Sprited VIP""
* The Reason is more sex mixed with sex. This song is done in a similar style to those he did in the early days of Skrillex. It's a song you hear and think nothing other than ""Fuck yeah it's going to be a good day"". Listen to this shit and you'll be in nothing other than a good mood. You can't be in anything other than a good mood. I don't like the vocals too much though. At least at the beginning. I think it would of sounded a bit better if Sonny did the vocals himself, but that's just me.
* Leaving is amazing as well. On the youtube video, there are so many ""brosteppers"" as I call them, that are commenting ""Where's the drop?"". I really wish I could delete every single one of those comments. I think there's a common opinion among all the subscribers of this subreddit that a song doesn't need a drop to sound amazing. When Skrillex does ambient music that you'd listen to after some sort of experience that needs heavy thought after, he does it fucking well. Summit is an example of this. I really hate brosteppers. DROP BRO WHERE'S THE DROP? SHUT THE FUCK UP PLEASE. I love Skrill's ambient type music. He did it well during the Sonny Moore project and he's doing it well under the name of Skrillex"	t5_2s7cz	True

To directly quote bnaz: 

""I would vote no for the integrity of the artists and the music. I'd
prefer no illegal downloads. Also, nesters should feel conflicted
about paying for something they're giving away for free to another.
That takes away the point of subscribing in the first place.""

""... it's clear piracy I'd probably remove it for the sake of keeping everything on /r/skrillex kosher.""

I would have to agree with all these points. I think the main difference here, is that posting Voltage studio for the 10th time and posting something that you paid for (??), is something that can be bought and paid for. It's something that can support the artist, and promoting piracy which kinda goes against the logical point of Nest.

That being said, anything posted here will merely be silently removed. No reprimands will be handed out for content posted here. If you really want to share the Nest love with other redditors, use the messaging feature. 

It's a very awkward legal position and me, bnaz, and I'm sure all of r/Skrillex does not want to feel the wrath of Big Beat. We're all aware of what they did to SkrillexMothership when they started sharing stuff they shouldn't have. (For those of you that don't, SM was shut down after sending some stuff around).

I realise that most of you are offended by this. I'm sorry. But it's really the best route to take. I'd rather not kick the proverbial sleeping dog. I hope you all understand"	t5_2s7cz	True

When i asked he said to me ""i don't know if he's going to be releasing what i heard, or even releasing the album anymore."" This to me sounds like sonny is scraping quite alot of his work perhaps or even struggling to work on the tracks with all this work hes got on his shoulders already.

First of all, I want to thank you so much for supporting the Nest.  This is not about changing the music industry now, it's about supporting great and forward thinking tools like Drip.Fm to connect us on a more personal level.  The fact that we have a direct way to give you guys content without any of the red tape that the normal distribution mediums have makes it really easy fun for us and gives us a new platform to be creative and spontaneous.  We hope you know that we put a great effort into providing awesome stuff straight to you.

 

Here are some songs that I put together for an EP that came together last minute.  Scary Bolly Dub is a song I've been playing in my sets for a while.  I use it more as a DJ tool, but I wanted you guys to have it.

 

The Reason and Leaving came together last minute.  I made Leaving in my hotel room in Mexico and just finished The Reason an hour ago in my hotel room in Miami.  I guess it's just kind of a reflection of how I'm feeling right now.  Hope you guys enjoy these quality WAVS.  

 

Sincerely,

Sonny Moore

We recently reached 3,000 subscribers, and this subreddit is growing quicker than ever. I'm going to post some graphs later, because it's quite impressive how much we have grown as a community. 

Anyways, what I am here to talk about today is the introduction of a /r/skrillex IRC channel. IRC is basically a way of chatting online, and has been around for quite a long time. You can find more info by googling it. 

Our channel is hosted on the Freenode network, and the channel name is **##redditskrillex**.

If you don't want to install any programs, you can go to http://webchat.freenode.net/ , put in the username you want to use, and the channel, **##redditskrillex**. 

There are many less rules here, but please be respectful. 


We hope to see you around!

Skrillex lost in the ""Best New Artist"" category to Bon Iver, a group that released a critically acclaimed album that was released in the year 2008. How are they new artists? 

Keep in mind, I'm ecstatic that he walked away with 3 awards tonight and am not trying to be selfish here. If he was going to lose, it would've made more sense if he lost to Nicki Minaj due to her mainstream popularity. 

Bon Iver has been around though and Skrillex got denied a truly deserved moment in the spotlight.  "	t5_2s7cz	True

Back then I had little interest in harder electro, so I ditched Rock 'n Roll after listening to it for the first minute.


But Kill Everybody was different. It was not like other hard electro songs I heard before. More like a mix between orchestral electro, hard electro and breakcore.
Somehow I didn't think it was good enough to put in my music library, but every time I visited the blog afterwards I listened to it.


After a while I just downloaded it with Rock 'n Roll (which turned out to be pretty good after listening a bit longer :D)


After discovering the rest of the SM&amp;NS EP I also got myself All I ask of You and SM&amp;NS (Zedd Remix).
