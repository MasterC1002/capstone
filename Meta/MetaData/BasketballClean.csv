I'd been playing alright, crossing a few guys up (kinda) and hitting a few jumpshots. 

It was a 2 on three fast break situation, the other two defenders weren't trying to get back. I set a weak screen and rolled off my man as he lunged for my buddy who had the ball. The lane opened up for me as my buddy slung me the ball. I caught it two handed, bounced the ball once then took two steps and leaped off my left leg. 

I've dunked before off a no dribble run up, and I've dunked legit on my hoop at home a few times as well. I don't know why, but I decided to dunk on this particular fast break.

It was nothing fancy, I went up with two hands but kinda dropped away my left as I rose. I threw it down as hard as I could and the basket made that satisfying rattle. 

My teammates got hyped, and we whooped and yelled for 20 seconds. It was a fucking great feeling and just another reminder of why I love this game so much.

The things I can do: 
-shoot free throws around 50% 
-play basic defense
-make layups with my right hand and some with my left 
-basic dribbling, but not well enough to get past good defenders
-passing. I think I can pass pretty well and have okay court vision from watching a lot. 

My problem areas: 
-shooting. I learned to shoot without jumping and now taking jump shots feels really weird. 
-rebounding. I'm 6' 3"" but I often still get outrebounded by smaller guys.

I want to congratulate you on doing such a fantastic job as League Commissioner and wish you the best in your future endeavors.

As a life time basketball fan I have tremendous respect for the League and the job you have done over the years, however I do have one major complaint with the NBA.  Now I love basketball, and my six year old Jack loves basketball as well.  As we watched Game 7 last night I was incredibly disturbed to see the amount of arguing with officials and complaining about calls, mainly by the Heat players.  I am neither a Spurs nor a Heat fan but simply a basketball fan as I watched The Finals (Knicks 2014!) this year.  However I strongly feel that talking back to the officials, whining about calls, or doing the arms up- out to the side- surprised pose, that so many on the Heat seemed to do is equally as detrimental to the game as flopping.  

In my sons peewee basketball league we teach the kids to play - key word - to play the game.  We are trying to build strong characters, to shape young men so that they grow into men of honor and integrity.  We teach them to lose with class and to take RESPONSIBILITY for their actions.  Please tell me why it is OK for NBA players to talk back to the officials in such a way as the Heat did last night.  Please tell my son that it doesn't matter how much money you make - the players play the game and the officials will officiate the game.  I was utterly disgusted by the amount of complaining and arguing done in this series.  It was a breath of fresh air to see the Spurs play so hard and lose with such dignity.  After any call against them their was none to minimal complaint, it was an incredibly black and white comparison (quite literally as well) when it came to either team complaining to officials.  I am grateful that organizations such as the San Antonio Spurs have not lost sight of the fundamental, character building traits basketball can instill in men.  The Spurs showed that professional players can simply do their job and play the game (key word - play the game) with class and integrity and will allow the officials to do their jobs.  Please do something about the talking back to officials and the whining face/pose that most players seem to make to ""plead"" their case.  Please help me explain to my son why he should celebrate the Spurs even after such a loss and not use certain Heat players as his role model - for life and for basketball.

Thank you.





EDIT::

After reading some replies I want to add a few points.  I agree that blindly accepting authority is not a good thing to teach kids or a good principal to live by.  However we are talking here about the game of basketball which has rules and that by agreeing to play this game you are agreeing to the rules.  

After getting my thoughts in writing I guess my main problem is simply how ridiculous a lot of the players look when they are whining or arguing with the officials, it seems as if they didn't take responsibility for their own actions.  

I understand the passion and the emotions involved, especially in a Game 7, but I don't think every player deserves the right to talk to the referee.  In Rugby only the Captain can talk to the official.  If a player has a problem they tell the captain and the captain will discuss it with the official while the game is going on.  If basketball were to enforce something similar in which captains and coaches were the only ones to argue (at least verbally) I would be much happier."	t5_2qhsv	True

Close friend of mine has been working on a basketball shooting aid for several months and finally launched a indiegogo fundraiser for it. I had the opportunity to try it out last month and I was personally impressed. 

I used to play basketball when I was a little (my dad even had the misguided notion of putting a mini half-court in our backyard) but haven't played in years outside of pick-up. My shots were just sad, bad form and all board. Once I slipped on what he calls the Peace Shooter, my first shot was all net (he won't let me forget it) and my accuracy improved quite a bit.

With that being said, if you guys have just 3 minutes to spare you should at least watch the video on the fundraiser and decide if it's worth getting.

The people I play with school are pretty bad - they can shoot pretty good, but have next to no handles or cabability around the hoop. I'm 183 (6 foot), so I'm just above average height for my grade. I treat playing with them as practice more than an actual game.

However, they've stopped letting me pla with them as of yesterday, so now I get 0 actual game time (it was only half-court anyway, but yeah...). Does anyone have some tips and drills for game preparation that I can do at home alone? or with a parent?

I'm the only one in my country town who even likes the sports enough to practice, so I have no 'team' or schoolgroup to play with. However, I'm going inner-state later on in the year to play for my part of the state, and I've NEVER played a game with referee or whatever. I'm aware of the rules, it's just playing with 9 other people (and one or more who are better/as good as me) is what I'm not used to.

My preferred position is Point, which can be a problem. However my passing and court vision is pretty good, when I play with friends. I would play shooting guard, but my three point is around 20-30%, not so good, and playing small forward I feel too limited (not enough court-vision, no real driving, no way to show handles). Plus small forwards on TV are like 6'8"" average (lebron) haha.

I played basketball since I was four until about two years ago. Up  until that point I had fantastic coaches. I worked harder for them than for anyone else. Because I wanted to work for them. I did camps and loved every aspect of it. Until one year I went into the 7th grade and I had a new coach and I tried out for the team. I made it like I figured I would. (small town, only about 7 of us had real talent) Now I get told in my school that I show no emotions towards anything and that's fine with me. But the two weeks I was on that team something changed about how I looked toward basketball and as a person. I don't think we even touched a basketball the entire time I was there. We got screamed at and ran for two hours seven days a week (7am practice on saturday and sundays) I lost 15 pounds in a week and 7th grader me had a mental breakdown. I cried every waking moment for a week after. I went to school maybe once that week telling my parents I had thrown up and I couldn't go. I even regretfully tried to break my own arm at one point so I could be off the team. But then I realized I should just quit the team after I hated the game at that point. I only recently even started playing basketball in my driveway again and i realize again why I love the game. That experience as a 7th grader broke me from probably ever wanting to play basketball on my high schools team.  And it hurts me so much that the game I once loved with such passion is now something I never want to play competitively again.

1348800254.0	10lln8	Question about layup fake and traveling	wangstagangsta	14	1	11	"Howdy gang, I got a quick question regarding rules surrounding faking a layup and pivot foot. Sorry for the amateur question, hopefully someone can enlighten me. 

On a breakaway, I'm dribbling down court w/ a defender in pursuit. He is catching up and I know he will attempt a swat at my layup. I gather the ball as I go up for the layup and take my two steps (right followed by left). 

However, I come to a stop without lifting my first step (right) and wait for him to inevitably fly by me. 

Here is where I'm confused:

1.) Now that I'm alone under the basket, (with both feet on the ground) is it legal for me to resume my layup? By that I mean take a step towards the basket with my left feet (lifting the right foot off the ground) and jumping off the left?

OR

2.) Do I have to jump off my right foot (or both feet) since it is now a pivot foot?

I feel like its option 2 but it feels really awkward jumping off my right foot.  

----------------------------------------------------------------

Another similar scenario:

I have the ball and I'm dribbling with my back to the basket in the post. I hop step and gather the ball in order to have the option of pivot foots.  I decide to spin on my left foot (counterclock wise) 180 degrees in order to face the basket. 

I show the shot and bait the defender to jump.  Then I step with my right foot under him.  

Now that I have taken 1 step (with right foot, left foot still pivot), do I:

1.) Get to lift my left foot off the ground as I attempt a layup with my left hand?

OR 

2.) have to jump off both feet in order to make the shot?

Again, option 2 sounds right but its so awkward since I'm contorted in a weird way and I can get my unathletic body to get more than 2 inches off the ground.  

Thanks for reading! These are all just local pickup games and I honestly don't think I'll be called if I do option 1 in either scenario, but I would like to know what I can/can't do out there. Seems like people think you're doing the right thing as long as you act like you know what you're doing. "	t5_2qhsv	True

Any good workout ideas to get me more explosive/stronger/highervertical/really conditioned? (I'm already starting handling/shooting drills) Also, what should my diet look like? Should I be eating at maintenance level, any macros/ratio splits etc?

So I'm trying to get better (a LOT better) in order to play in an intramural basketball league at my college. I'm a short guy, around 5'8. Haven't really ever done serious weight-training, just messed around here and there. Somewhat conditioned, but not the point where I'd like to be. I'm kind of a chubby guy, but I'm still able to keep up with everyone on the court so I'm not insanely out of shape.

Basically, I was wondering if anyone could give me workout plans to get in shape and fit for my position (obviously aside from the handling drills and shooting drills, I already do those. I'm really lacking on the ""athletic side"" of things) 

Also, what should my diet look like? would 40/40/20 on a maintenance level be something I'd strive to do? Also, what exactly would be my maintenance level if I'm working out say 5 days a week.

Sorry for all the newbie question guys, I'm just really trying to get in shape for the intramural games. Definitely have the dedication and motivation for it, I just have no idea where to go for workout routine/plans. 

EDIT: I found this earlier and was thinking about using a hybrid of the soccer/basketball training regimens. Would that be fine? http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/paul3.htm

Couldbesomeone	11	0	25	"So, I'm an exchange student from Norway, and I've never played basketball. I've done the occasional shot or dribbling in school, but that pretty much totals to nothing. Now a couple of weeks ago, I joined the basketball team. Our season hasn't started, so I was just practicing with everyone. I like my teammates and I have friends there. I am also very athletic, I used to be a black belt after 11 years of martial arts, and I lift weights and run all the time.

However, the other day, I got tired of never being allowed to play when we were 5 on 5, and after practice I went and asked my coach if I could play, and the douchebag told me that I was too bad to play, and he wanted to take me off the team. This is against school policy, and he cannot do that, but I'm pretty sure he is trying to make me quit. I however, have no plans of doing that. I want to get as good as you can, and I will practice every day after school and many hours every weekend, and show him that I can do it.

I started playing pick-up with my friends a lot and I'm not very good, but I have a strong determination to get better. In our complex we live in there is an outside hoop and I'll go out there for an hour, hour and a half and just shoot by myself. That's all fine well and good I realise but my ball handling is pretty horrible. When it comes to game time I can't dribble for shit it seems like. I can do the sizeup dribbles through the legs and everything but I can't seem to just make a drive to the basket (I'm 5'10"" and white before we continue) and I really want to play 5-on-5 as a PG because I'm not that good of a shot and I really only understand how to run the PG (or SG) position and I'm really too short for anything else. Naturally to be a good PG I need to work on my ball handling, my court vision is okay but I figure that will come with time and for it to come I need to be able to dribble well.

1337487974.0	tvm8g	Why are rules easier for nba players than high school players?	Jwill20	16	5	16	If some one was to only watch nba games then use that knowledge in high school they would be screwed. In the nba there is virtually no walks or travels called even though they happen nearly every play. Another example is free throws, in high school you can't move until the ball has touched the rim, in the nba you can practically leave the line as soon as the shooter starts his shot. My last example is favoritism, there are a few players (Kobe and Dirk) who the refs seem to think are perfect. It seems every time these players get the ball there is a foul called no matter who made the contact or if there even was contact.

[Here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dkvhj/request_your_nba_logos_here/) the thread for the logos. Also, one way to take over a subreddit with an inactive mod is to submit a request to http://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest . They handle requests for incorrectly banned subreddits, but also step in when there are unmaintained or abandoned subreddits. Make a post linking to /r/basketball and explain that the creator hasn't been on Reddit in two years.

Im 15 years old, around 5'6. I am a slasher who can play the 1/2/3 position, due to my massive vertical for my age and size. In the game i played i got stripped alot because of my sub-par ball handling skills and that turned into a lot of fast break points. I also struggled to slash properly. I could penetrate the lane but I wouldnt be able to get past the bigs.

i really want to work on my Handling and Slashing. Can you guys give me some tips/drills to help me work on this? We lost our last grand final and ill do everything in my power to stop it from happening.

Any help is appreciated :)

I play competitvely on a local rep team, on my high school team and even for the under 15 Ontario Team.  One thing that has been missing from my game is the ability to dunk.  Over the last year I've been doing various forms of basic lower body excercises and have somewhat increased my vertical leap.  I'm currently 5'11 with a standing reach of about 8 feet.  Considering i can get about 1-2 inches above the rim, I'd say I'm standing at a 24-26 inch vertical leap.  And as I'm sure you can all guess, I'm here to ask about what is the quickest and most efficent way to be able to dunk WITHOUT USING WEIGHTS (I don't have access to gym equipment).  I'd also like to know approximately how many more inches I need.  Oh, and I know there's something called google but all the results require either weights or aren't descriptive enough.  Any help would be greatly appreciated ;).

The outdoor use is to be able to play on my tiled court (sport court if you've heard of it) and to play indoors at my local gym's hardwood floor. It seems like there are a bunch of indoor balls you can't go wrong with, but I don't think they'd fair well outdoors even it was on a tile surface. What I'm finding difficult to find an indoor/outdoor ball that seems to play well on both the hardwood and other surfaces. 

The biggest complaint I've been reading is that many of the indoor/outdoor balls don't transition that well to hardwood courts. A lot of the common complaints are grip and bounce of the ball on hardwood for the indoor/outdoor balls. Is there a ball that I might be possibly overlooking that does? If not, is there a combination of two balls I can buy (one indoor and one outdoor) that won't break the bank, but don't suffer hugely in quality? 

I used to own an outdoor Spalding Never Flat (lasted 3 years) that I was very fond of, so that would **at the moment** be my first choice outdoor ball if the two basketball route is the most logical one to go. "	t5_2qhsv	True

my dream is *not* to play in the NBA.  people would ask, ""what do you want to do be when you grow up?"" and i would think, its so unfair that i cant play ball for a living but realistically my NBA dreams were dead by age 10.  i idolized pete maravich and there is one clip where he tells the reporter he used to spend 6-8 hours a day playing/shooting.  ""you don't get here [the nba] by just wishing.""  he grew to be 6'4, worked his fucking ass off and played in the 70s (people are just better now).  there was no hope for me being an athletic freak and i was pretty realistic even as a young kid.  it was just never gonna happen.  it seems silly to even think that i actually had to have these thoughts, but whatever i was just a kid.

after years of playing pickup in college, my dream was sparked when i was studying abroad in europe.  completely by chance i ended up playing on a club team in Spain.  i had grown 3 inches after high school and im about 6'3 and i'd gotten pretty good.  i had always been a big bruiser type in high school but had gotten more skilled by then.  i lost 10 or so pounds too just by living and eating in europe for some months so i was quicker and better than i'd ever been.  the amazing thing was that the club paid some of its players.  it was really not much at all but holy shit did that make me excited.  i basically got paid exactly what my rent cost (which was shit, but still awesome to me) and all i had to do was get some of my european friends to come to some games.  easy

btw, they play so different in Spain (not sure if all europe).  much more skill oriented and way less physical.  being used to playing physically, even for an american, i had a huge advantage.  they were still good, just different style.  they were skinnier, quicker, good shooters and euro-steppers.  only the clumsy guys played inside; there were huge guys that played like guards.  they called a lot of fouls on me in the beginning but i got the hang of it.  even if you get all ball on a rip or a block, if the contact is forceful enough it's still considered a foul to them.  it took me a long time to realize that.

it had never occurred to me that you could make money playing ball in europe.  one thing was that i never considered moving to another country (semi-permanently) until i was actually there.  so when my program ended i moved home and went back to college to finish up my senior year.  i went to a D1 state school and i was dead set on trying out for the team.  i was jacked up, man.  i was gonna try out and make the team or not, i was gonna move back to europe and get paid to play ball for a club team.  i was one of the best without doing much but just playing pick up, so i looked into it and saw i could make (to me, again, not much) some solid dough getting better and playing at a higher level.  i'd get a job on the side in IT, my field, or speaking/teaching english if i had to, but fuck it, i was gonna do it.  

i trained pretty hard.  i played pick up games like 4-5 times a week and worked out.  i was cleaning 225, benching 95lb dumbbells and squatting i dont even remember lol but i wasnt bulky.  i was dunking in games too, which i had never been able to do before.  i was playing with/against a couple ju-co transfers at the gym who were trying out as well, but they were basically shoe-ins (spelling?) hence why they transferred.  i was excited to at least see where i stood in the tryouts, ya know?  i didnt really think i would make it, but i was strong and in good shape and having fun. i mean, i was still living my life too.

2 months before the tryouts i was playing pickup with some friends and i came down on someone and sprained my ankle.  i had no idea sprains were that bad, i remember seeing isiah thomas playing an entire fucking game with a sprained ankle.  i was still on crutches during the tryouts.  it was fucking miserable, man.  sprains take forever to heal; it would have been better if i broke it.  i didnt play for 6 or 7 months.  it was at this point, looking back, that my dream died.  

i met a girl, finished college, got a job.  this past summer i got into a routine where i was playing almost everyday after work and i got pretty good again, but ill never do anything more than pick up games.  im not moving to europe or anywhere.  im only 23, but i got my family, my girl, who i live with, and my job.  my dream is dead and there is nothing i can do about it.  feels bad man, feels bad.  im just a pathetic wanna be who set a pathetic goal and couldnt reach it.  im a nobody who failed at becoming a nobody.  im just one of those typical douchy guys who plays pick up at the gym.  i was never *that* good, it's just something that i wanted *that* bad, ya know?  i love the game and i figured this sub can at least relate to that part and so i dont have to explain it.  i just wanted to get that off my chest.  

""when you wish upon a star, you are a millions years too late.  that star is dead, just like your dreams."" 

EDIT: i dont know if any of you will see this edit, but you have really made me feel better about this.  thank you"	t5_2qhsv	True
1356580496.0	15i2d2	How useful are hook shots to the average basketball player?		8	0	7	"Hello, I'm a bit new to basketball.  I played in a church league back in 5th grade, but that's about all of my basketball experience :/

So anyways, I was looking up the hook shot, and it seems not many people use it anymore.  Though, with practice it looks to be a great scoring method.  One of my classmates on the basketball team tends to use it a lot and he gets a high amount of points using it close to he basket.  He's also only 6'2"" while I'm 6'1"".  

I have no interest playing for my school, maybe just playing pick up games at the gym with a few friends or even a low-skill league over the summer.  Is the hook shot as useful as many make it out to be?

1. Game starts with winner of last game checking up
2. Before we start shooting free throws we have to ""break""m which means making a NBA range 3 pointer.
3. Shoot up to three free throws not all day
4. No fouls unless extremely obvious
5. When we get to 21 you have to make another NBA 3 to win the game
6. If you miss the game clinching three you go back to 15
7. If you get stuck a 20 you go back to 15 after you make your next attempt
8. If someone calls Iceberg after a made bucket anybody not shooting is allowed to distract the shooter as long as they don't touch the shooter.

Anybody else play by these rules? What are some rules you guys play by?"	t5_2qhsv	True

1346612178.0	z8oik	Something that has worked for me...	WK3	9	2	3	After doing an upper body lift, go and play some basketball. Warm up for about ten minutes (you'll need it). And then play in a pick up game. Of course when you start your warm up, you won't be able to hit anything. It will feel really weird. After your warm up though, the soreness/tightness of your muscles will make it very easy to shoot. My friend and I, being shooters, found it incredibly easy to make a shot after warming up with form shooting and working our way out to the 3 point line. Just try it out. It may be for you, or it may not. Obviously, if you're a bad shooter to begin with, this won't help much. Let me know if anyone else has done this or it has worked for them!	t5_2qhsv	True

2) if I raise my left arm up to my face, and push his swatting arms away, am I fouling? 
3) He's quicker, so he's going to be in front of me most times. What should I do in order to get a good shot? I am taller and heavier.

Im having trouble finding rhythm on the basketball court. My mind freezes up and bad things happen. When I play 5vs5 at the gym and get the ball im like a deer in headlights. When I play 4v4 its not that bad. Here's the thing. Im not a terrible player. When its 3vs3 half court I score pretty easily no problem. I suspect this is a classic problem of not having enough space to work with. Therefore I freeze up become stiff take a bad shot or get the ball stolen from me. Other games I show great potential.

2) How do you protect the ball when going for a layup and the defender is right next to you ready to swipe the ball or hold for a jump ball?

1353197912.0	13dj2p	Defense Advice (High school basketball player trying out for the team)	brillyx	8	1	8	"Hey /r/Basketball. I'm a junior trying out for my high school basketball team. Today we didn't have any try outs, but tomorrow and Monday we do. Friday was our first try out, and I think I did pretty good. I hustled my ass off, I got some rebounds, I intercepted a pass, and I took some shots when we did 5 on 5. I think as a junior, with only 6 seniors on the varsity team, 5 starting, that leaves space open for good juniors to move up to varsity bench, which means I think there will be room for me on jv bench. I hope I make it.

But one thing is, when we were doing 1 on 1's, we had to block the offense from going a certain way and, the goal of it, was to make them use their weak hand. *I made the mistake of trying to block the right side but they went with their right anyways, which I'm still kicking myself in the butt for...*. Anyways, I had some trouble sliding with the person taking the ball to the hoop. Do you think I should have been backing up instead of sliding, or do you think my slides were too slow?

Also, I was slipping around a bit on the gym floor. How do you think I could prevent that?"	t5_2qhsv	True

1370878729.0	1g1srs	my best move (in painful detail). post yours if you'd like!	asdjmo	6	0	3	"As a gift, I am going to let you in on a little secret and I encourage you to do the same.  I am about to disclose my best move.  I only ask that if you decide to use it, that you do it well.  I probably do this 2 second action better than anything else in the entire world.  This move is the ol’ “up and under” with slight variations.  I couldn’t even estimate how many times I’ve scored on this move.  It doesn’t require quickness/athleticism and it’s great against bigger and smaller defenders.  Although I am going to describe it in detail, it’s very simple.  The reasons I do this well is by the details, so I will be painfully thorough.  OK, I’ll just get on with it:  

**Get the ball in the post (step 0):** this is a post move.  Set yourself up 2-3 feet above the block.  Post up with your elbows out, arms up and meet the pass when it’s thrown (give up a little ground and move towards the ball to catch it).  This move is predicated on the fact that you have caught the ball in the post, which can be difficult sometimes.  I normally tell people to feed me the ball in the post by throwing the ball as hard as they can at my hands (or face).  “try and break my fingers” is what I say.  This is because bounce passes or weak passes get batted away by the defender very easily and fouls are not often called on post feeds, even if they deserve to be.  

(I am going to assume you are on the left block from now on)

**Set up (step 1):** OK, you’ve caught the ball, hopefully not too far outside the lane and hopefully not too low (above the block is ideal).  If you are too low, maybe do a different move.  If you are too far out, take one dribble and use your body to gain some ground on your defender to get a little closer.  If you are in the sweet spot, don’t hesitate.  When you catch the ball immediately make a dribble with your left hand and then half spin to your left side, like a drop step left.  In this motion, you are dribbling and then dropping your left shoulder back while taking a small step toward the block with your left foot.  Imagine you were going to dribble, quickly fake left and then go right for a fade-away—this is exactly the action you want to do (minus shooting the fade-away).  This is effective for two reasons 1) you pick up your dribble.  Defenders are more likely to jump/bite on the fake if you pick up your dribble.  2) the jab left it really sells the shot fake.  Both are really subtle and the key is doing them quickly and smoothly.

**The fake (step 2):**  so you have dribbled, and done the half spin (you pick up your dribble as you half spin), now you are going to do the shot fake.  This should be done as naturally as possible.  The key is spinning quickly (pivoting on your right foot) and selling the shot fake.  You should 1) (mostly) square up then 2) SHOW THE BALL—bring it above your head in your shooting motion and 3) look at the basket.  

**The prestige (step 3):** you have done the shot fake and your defender is now jumping out of his shorts trying to block it (seriously this almost always works on the first time, you’ll be able to feel it out eventually.  Also I have scored on this move without getting the defender to jump just by getting him leaning towards the shot fake).  Now you *could* just step across with the left foot (sweeping the ball across) and then go up for the layup like in [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEAZlN9XPnI), and while I used to do this with success, it does expose the ball to the defender (also results in too much contact sometimes) but you should do this instead: reverse pivot on your right foot and spin back to the left with total disregard for human life.  You are undoing the steps that got you in the shot fake position, plus spinning a little bit more to get your body squared to go up for a layup.  The reverse spin also looks cooler and can be done faster and more gracefully.  The downside is you break eye contact with the basket but you be able to re-orient yourself quickly, especially with practice.  Now just make the damn shot!  

This works on every kind of defender.  I can usually feel when I am posting someone up, before I catch the ball, if it’s going to work.  I can feel the anxiousness of the defender, like he is ready to pounce.  I love doing this when I am guarding the best guy on the floor.  I am surprised how much it works against smaller guys, but they jump like crazy.  Bigger guys too--especially bigger guys, actually.  When you post up a bigger guy, you are like attacking his ego or something and he really wants to put you in your place.   A caveat is that when I do this move on guys that are 6’6 and over, some can fall for the shot fake and still recover to block the lay-up.  If the guy on you is really athletic and huge you may have to dribble, half-spin left, shot fake right, spin left, shot fake again, spin back right and go up.   Did I lose you?  Probably.  

**TL;DR catch ball above left block in post, dribble once, half spin left, pivot right into shot fake, spin left, layup.  ‘Up and under with reverse pivot’**

The other day I was playing in a pick up game, and I had the ball in the post.  I took on dribble and spun towards the middle and went up with it.  According to a guy on the other team, I pivoted then lifted my pivot foot and jumped off of my other foot.  I thought I jumped off both feet, but it was a pick up game so I didn't argue.  Anyways, even if I did jump off of my non pivot foot, would that still be a travel?  I know you're supposed to get two steps, and most of the time that's when you're running towards the basket.  I don't know if it applies differently when your back is to the basket or if you don't dribble out of the post.  Most of what I've found doesn't address specific situations.  Granted I did dribble, but still.  So anyway if anyone can help me get some clarification here, I'd appreciate it."	t5_2qhsv	True

Back when I was about 9 I had a coach for my YMCA team that inspired us all. We lost just about every game that season, and some of us weren't even into the game. About 2 weeks later our coach rented out a room in Fuddruckers (Our local hick restaurant) and we had a trophy party. We all shared stories and had a good time. When it came time to hand out the trophies, coach told us a story about his cousins. Most of them lived near him so they all went out and played Basketball together after school, except for one of them. He was the kid no one wanted to hang out with, but everyone always had his back. He was always shooting on the other hoop, one free throw at a time. He wasn't the best shooter, yet he went out on the court and shot, day after day. Gradually he became a better shooter and started making the majority of his shots. You wanna know who he was? Shaquille O'neal. 

This really inspired me and I assume it did for the rest of the team too. Just remember this story if you are ever getting frustrated or think you're not good enough. You can get there, just believe in yourself.


tl:dr, Shaq is my old coach's cousin, and he was not great to start out with. FEEL INSPIRED NAO!!

So, to understand my problem you'll probaly need some back story. So, I've benn playing handball for a couple of years now, (if you haven't heard of it, then try and google it). Anyway, in handball you often jump on your ""weak"" leg when jumping up for a shot, and unfortunately I've carried this over to when I'm playing basketball. 
Of course it only happens when I'm going in for a dunk/layup. (When shooting a jumper I jump on both feet).

Here's where my questions come:
I've got a feeling that if I could master jumping on both my feet instead of only one of them, my vertical would increase. Is this true, or is it different from player to player. And if it's true, have any of you then got some good tips on how to optimal jumping on two feet?

_____

Hi Reddit, I recently became obsessed with playing hoops a year ago. Unfortunately, I've found that as a young adult, its really hard for me to be able to find people to play with and am wondering if anyone can identify and/or give some advice on how to make things easier.

I am currently 22 and have no problem finding people to play pick-up with at the college I am currently attending. That said, I am about to graduate and have found that its a completely different situation once I am out of school. 

When I go to parks or rec centers with the intention of playing pick up with people, I find that its extremely hard to get into a game at all because the courts are taken up entirely by established crews of people. Play is extremely competitive and everyone already seems to have their own thing going on. Even if I show up with some of my own friends  I can never get a full 5 so its always hard to get into a game.

I can't help but wonder if this is merely the result of my own personal situation. For starters, my appearance seems like an impediment. I am a 5'8 150lb white kid who admittedly doesn't look like he knows what the fuck he's doing. For instance, except for my basketball shoes, I don't dress like your archetypal ball player: my shorts are rarely long, and I can't go spending the extra dollar on ""underarmor"" or ""Nike"" brand apparel (again, sans the shoes). I also didn't play on a high school team so I lack some of the fancy ball handling, like under the leg dribbling that one develops from drills. 

That said, my fundamentals are where they need to be and I can play how my body type should. I have a high shooting % from mid-range, good court vision, a high jump (can touch rim, can 't dunk), and basically, a decent basketball IQ. 

Another theory I have is that I am just simply too out of touch with the type of people that I usually run into at these types of places. Please don't misconstrue that as me saying that ""all people that play pickup are like ___,"" I am just taking about people in the courts where I live. I should also include that I am admittedly guilty of not having left my comfortable homogenous upper middle class bubble too often. I am not that familiar with physical competition with strangers (sure, at school I play with strangers, but there's at least that common link). 

When I try to talk to people in order to meet people or try to get a game I can't avoid (for lack of better words) ""sounding white."" I can't help being shy no matter how much I try to. Its frustrating because I can't think of another social realm in which I feel like I struggle so much. Believe me, this isn't simply a symptom of a bigger social pathology. 

I've tried many alternatives like playing in a rec. league and trying to get a group of friends together. The rec. league was simply too much commitment and $. As for playing with friends, I'll simply say that its hard to get a number of friends with full-time jobs together to do something when you're a young adult. 

I feel like I am running out of options and fear that I'll have to give up what is currently my favorite pass time. THUS, I am wondering if anyone has any advice. Beyond craigslist, is there some kind of social networking website that anyone would suggest? I've looked into a few and haven't found anything that's yielded fruitful results. Maybe there's some pick-up etiquette I am missing out?

it occurred to me recently that maybe its as simple as frequenting a place as often as possible until I get acquainted with people by mere virtue of familiarity, but I fear that I could just be that leper who shows up and nobody wants to include. ANYWAY, as can be seen by my lengthy post, pick-up bball is something I care about so any help would be welcome.

I want some tips on how I can stand out in front of the coach(es) conducting the tryouts, make a good impression and also improve the way I play. I'd also like to make it clear that I *will* be trying out for the team in all four years of high school.

This is my first post here and I wanted everyone's opinion on a matter from an AAU game I coached last night. 

I coach at a smaller town's team and one that is a resort town and kids really don't focus that much on basketball, so our kids struggle sometimes. Also, we were missing our 4 best players and playing one of the better teams in the tournament, so needless to say we were getting beat by a lot. 

Here is my question: There was not one call made in the second half until about 2 minutes left in the game. One of my kids was in the lane for what must have been 12 seconds, the official gave the kid three warnings before calling the violation. They were calling the game as a blowout and in an AAU tournament where its all about learning, I felt this was a disservice to everyone involved. Letting my kids get away with a travel here and there is not helping them. 

In your opinion, should this be the practice? Don't call anything and get the game over with?

Thanks"	t5_2qhsv	True

I've only been able to find photos online showing the front label (NBA and Spalding logos) but I need more photos than that. It is impossible for me to make *accurate* vent label textures without a reference. Sure I could simply slap in a generic vent and call it done but I'm aiming for photorealism.

Does anyone here own any of these four basketballs?

1. NBA Development League: http://i.imgur.com/CpAJ8DN.jpg

2. NBA ""Tack-Soft"": http://i.imgur.com/D0eYflp.jpg

3. NBA ??: http://i.imgur.com/HXeqiZI.jpg

4. NBA Platinum Street Ball: http://i.imgur.com/cLNNL3N.jpg

I would need at least two photos of each basketball. One close-up photo directly from the side showing the area where the channels meet and another close-up photo showing the vent and the label around it. The label and channels should be straight on, a photo from an angle isn't quite as useful to me.

The lighting conditions aren't too important as I am simply using these photos as reference, as long as the channels and the label are visible and you can read the letters it's good enough for me. It shouldn't be too hard as they contrast quite well with the orange color. The resolution of the photos should be as large as you can get.

I would create a vector of the vent label using your photo as a reference and then use a bitmap of that vector in a commercial model. Nothing from your photo is directly used in my textures. I need the photo of the channels for the 3D model to get a rough idea how wide (and the shape if it differs from the traditional 8 panel design) the panels are at the ends.

Below are two images I rendered of the 3D model I have already completed. These are types of photos I need of the real basketballs.

The squat is a functional exercise that trains the muscles in the lower body. The squat movement resembles the movement executed during jumps for rebounds or when making shots. To perform a correct squat, start with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart with your toes pointed at a 45-degree angle. Move your hips back and down as if you are sitting in a chair while keeping your back arched and chest up. Lower your hips until they are level with the knees and stand up to return to the starting position. Perform three sets of 10 repetitions.

Push-ups
Push-ups are another functional sport-specific exercise that trains a movement regularly seen in a basketball game. Increasing upper body strength with push-ups can improve passing and shooting ability. Start with your hands and feet on the ground, lower your chest to the ground and push straight up while keeping your body as straight as possible. Perform three sets of 10 repetitions.
Lateral Line Hops
Agility and quickness are skills that are used to play defense or run down loose balls. Lateral line hops train ground reaction and footwork to improve agility and quickness. Stand next to any line on the basketball court and hop horizontally over the line as fast as possible for 20 seconds. Take a 10-second rest and repeat for another 20 seconds. Complete a total of eight rounds following 20 seconds on and 10 seconds off.
Sit-ups
Sit-ups can improve abdominal strength. Basketball players use their abdominals for core stability while running and playing defense. Start by lying on the ground with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Crunch your torso up towards your knees as far as you can go, and lower yourself back down to the starting position. Complete three to four sets of 15 to 20 repetitions of sit-ups during practice.
Box Jumps
Jumping exercises can improve rebounding and jump shots. Set a box about 20 inches off the floor and stand next to the box. Jump explosively and land on top of the box. Either step down or jump down to the starting position, and repeat. Completing three sets of 10 to 15 box jumps at least three days per week can increase your vertical jump.
Lunges
Lunges can increase running speed, which can in turn increase the effectiveness of fast break situations by allowing you to beat your opponent down the court. Start at one end of the court and perform walking lunges the length of the court to the opposite baseline. Turn around and lunge back to the starting point.
Shuttle Run
A basketball game is full of accelerations and decelerations as the players change directions. The shuttle run is designed to improve your defensive ability by teaching you to change directions quickly and powerfully. Start on a baseline and run to the closest free throw line, touch the line and change directions, then run back to the baseline. Touch the baseline, change directions and run to half court. Upon reaching half court, touch the line and run back to the baseline. Change directions at the baseline and run to the opposite free throw line. Touch the line, return to the baseline, touch the line and run to the opposite baseline. Touch that line and return to the starting point.
Jump Rope
Jumping rope can improve stamina, endurance, jumping ability and power. Increasing your vertical jump can improve your jump shot and rebounding ability. Perform a maximum number of repetitions in 30 seconds followed by 30 seconds of rest. Repeat for a total of five rounds.
Pull-ups
Pull-ups are a classic upper-body exercise that is sport-specific to basketball. They train nearly every muscle in the upper-body, and can improve the ability to secure rebounds or loose balls. Perform three sets of 10 repetitions each.
Deadlift
Deadlifts can increase lower-body strength that will result in stronger box-outs to obtain more rebounds. They can also increase your vertical jump by training the major muscles involved in jumping. Set the deadlift bar at a weight that is challenging for five repetitions and perform a total of five sets.

I roll my ankle (either one) at least a few times through the year. Most likely 4-5. It all started early in highschool and although I've never actually broken an ankle or tore a tendon, I've had some nasty looking weeks. 

It has felt worse lately. As in- I don't just roll them by accidently stepping on a foot, but by literally defending a player or dribbling myself. I don't get it, but I will assume my tendons are weak from all the injuries and give out easier. 

I wear high bball shoes (derrick roses) and have large legs (I've always read ankle injuries are a result of weak calves, definitely not me). 

Recently I purchased a 60$ ankle brace for the one foot after an injury and it feels really nice and secure. But just yesterday I rolled the other one! mother fucker! My question is- is there anyway to solve this without grabbing another brace for the other foot? 

I'm worried that the braces will just weaken my ankles even more and maybe I would roll them often doing other things (the gym, etc) which has never happened before, but you never know. 

I've tried ankle strengthening excersises at the gym and that shit hasn't helped, much or at all. 

TL:DR: My ankles keep giving out and have been doing more so lately. I love basketball and need advice on what has helped others and whether braces are a good idea?

Let me be clear, I can't tell when ANYONE carries unless the ball literally comes to a stop in their hand. For example, I know that if the ball is on its way down and basically halts in the air for a second because the player is hesitating, that that's a carry. My problem is when the player ""carries"" the ball at the peak of its arc, especially in a crossover.

I've been told that one should never put his hand underneath the ball, but what constitutes underneath? Let's say one of the seams is parallel to the ground. Clearly holding the ball anywhere above the seam is fine, but what about underneath the seam? Is everything prohibited there? Initially I was under the impression that only the very bottom of the ball (takes up 1/4 of the ball) is prohibited.

Any help would be appreciated. Also, if you are going to direct me to the NBA video rule book, please provide more commentary than the rulebook does because I still find it a bit vague.

1346177766.0	yz1ql	What are pickup games like in your neck of the woods? 	utardjazz	5	0	11	"I'm in Utah, and usually play with a 20s-30s age group. 

The first 5 to hit free throws makeup one team, next 5 make the other. The others sit. Games are generally to 21 going by 2's and 3's, but this could be because I am very vocally opposed to counting by 1's and 2's. Winning team must win by 4 points. 

As far as rules go, anything involving counting is ignored. Close double dribble or traveling calls are usually let go. Defense calls fouls. Hand checking is allowed. Charges are not called unless it's painfully obvious. In those cases the accused are usually shamed into giving up possession. Defenses vary, nothing is illegal. No free throws. 

With the older crowds, 40's and up, the sitting players will continuously substitute into the game. The substitutions are made on the fly after every 2-3 made basketballs and follow a set rotation. I actually prefer this method, but most younger folk disagree. Also with the older crowds your team is guaranteed a 2 on 1 off rotation so everyone gets equal playing time. You also must bring two shirts/jerseys, one light and one dark. "	t5_2qhsv	True

5 on 5, and i couldn't miss a three if i wanted to (not true but thats what it felt like). One of our games i scored 8 of our 11 points. It's weird cause 3's really aren't 'my game', i'm more of a post player, but i was hanging out around the 3, and kept getting open. 

Best part was i hit a contested 3 pointer for the win; so contested that the guy pretty much landed on me when he came down. felt absolutely amazing when he walked off pissed as fuck because he couldn't do anything about it.

I'm an Adidas guy, so i like to stick to their shoes. I'd say these have to be my favorites so far, but i'm trying to figure out my next pair. Seeing as they don't seem to be very abundant, and i had trouble finding a pair for a decent price, i'm wondering what shoes adidas makes now are the best.

I like to play in the post, and i drive occasionally. Important factors to me are ankle support, width (i don't like how the crazy lights are so fucking narrow, it makes me feel like i'd roll my ankle in a second), and of course looks.

Just tips are also good, like what exercises to do, what not to do, and so on. Preferably gym-related since I won't have a lot of places I can practice basketball drills because we stop practicing until september, but I'll try my best.
I play center(2.10m/6'11"" height and 140kgs/310 pounds weight) for the local under-18/19 teams and I'm gonna play for the 2nd division team soon. Recently started working out at the gym, but I find that I don't know what to do for my leg muscles. Being a big player I don't expect any huge increase in my vertical leap, but I find that sometimes I get outrebounded by players who are shorter than me, but who can jump almost 3 feet and play the same position. Also, what about those weights you put on/above your ankles? I've read somewhere that they cause more damage than do good when it comes to strengthening your legs but I can't help but wonder why everyone is wearing them if they're so bad.
Some low-post moves would also be very helpful. I rely a lot on a pump fake and after that a hook shot from the outside, and that's what concerns me. I hardly ever get the chance to do anything else, and when I do, I don't have a lot of time to think my move through so I just go with the hook-shot after I back down into the defender a bit. My coach isn't helping at all, he's not teaching me anything(except for how to drive from the high-post after he realised I could be pretty unstoppable if I kept doing it), and I can't really limit myself to just 2 moves on offense for scoring(save for the occasional putback after an offensive board). I feel that because of my bigger size and weight, most of the local defenders won't stand a chance when I start backing down, and they don't do either. The problem is finishing around the rim. I can get to it with ease, but I can't finish the play.
The last thing that's been bugging me is a pretty common problem: free-throw shooting. I have a good release, I arc the ball high, but it just won't go in enough(right now, I'm shooting 40-50% on a normal day and 60% on a good day). I've considered shooting underhand, like Rick Barry used to, and I even found a youtube video of him teaching how to do it(can't say I ever tried to do so. it just seemed so weird). I personally wouldn't feel any shame or anything shooting like that. After all, who can argue with how you shoot it as long as you're making most of your free throws? Anyway, I'd love an opinion regarding this style of shooting, if you can call it that(I know I should try it and see if it fits me well first, but until I get the chance I'm gonna ask here).

Thanks in advance

My friends and I just launched a mobile app to allow people to compete in  physical games anywhere against anyone by recorded video! 

We really like basketball, and we think free throw shooting is a good ""mini"" game that works well with our concept.

So here's the deal: hit as many free throws you can in 1 minute and recording it using our app. 1 ball. You can have people help you rebound. Must be a public/legit court and ball.

$100 for 1st, $75 and $25 for 2nd and third. Both guys' and girls' competitions. I SWEAR - THIS IS REAL.

Here's the app (only on Android at the moment): https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.BeatYourRecord

And here's the explainer video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z16hs5KmyM4 (yes, our animator used underhand shots...ಠ_ಠ)

Here's a sample recording we made: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL0NRUA_e9w

Would love it if you guys gave it a shot. As many attempts as you like. It's in 'beta', so we know there'll be some bugs. Please report them to us. : ) We'll do our best to handle things quickly.

1) I'm just now developing the vertical to dunk.  I've been doing a lot of hiking and I think that might have given me the extra half inch of vertical and I can now dunk semi-regularly when getting a running start, jumping off one leg and extending up with my right hand only.  So I barely get the ball in and I've been developing these bruises/sore spots on my middle finger below two joints in the finger and also the joint where my middle finger meets my hand.  It really hurts to push on these spots and my hand stings a lot after a dunk.  Am I doing it wrong? Are there techniques to implement that will ease hand strain and damage?  Will the hand pain improve when I can get higher above the rim and not rush to slam it in so quickly?

2) I really like listening to music while shooting around by myself, but the only way I can do this is to put my ipod on an armsleeve and run some earbuds through my shirt.  Are there any products you guys would recommend that would let you listen to music in a more comfortable manner when shooting around?

Although, when ever I would play, all of my teammates would comment on my weird/bad shot release. I'd always just ignore what they were saying, I just thought my shot was a little bit different from theirs. But recently, I came to realize my shot IS very bad/ugly. My friend was recording me on his phone of me playing basketball, and then I looked at it. Basically, it looks like I'm just throwing it with both hands from near my left shoulder, if that adds a mental picture for you. (Might I add that it is very inconsistent) I have a basketball camp coming up in a few weeks and I don't want to embarrass myself badly in front of everyone else there.

But whenever I play point guard (6'1"") against smaller (5'X"") point guards, I nearly always get the ball stolen because they just go under or around or through me and take it. And I can't run fastbreaks because they are just so quick.

Since he was arguably one of the best of all time, how did he manage to be like he was at an NBA standard? I'm curious."	t5_2qhsv	True

When I turned 12, I stopped playing it in middle school because of the way the league was designed. Now I want to start playing again but I don't think I have the same fundamental skills as other kids at my school. 
      I'm 5'8 almost 5'9 and I weigh about 135 pounds, very little of that is fat, it's mostly muscle. I run Cross Country and Track so I am in very good shape and I'm one of the faster kids in my grade. I have a high vertical, higher than most kids in my grade ( I can't remember it exactly). So basically I consider my self in good enough shape to make the JV team next year. I'll be a Sophomore next year by the way. Also my Schools basketball teams aren't that great. 
      For my actual basketball skills, I'm lacking in some spots. I'm a good shooter because I had a basketball hoop at my old house and I would go out and take around 200 jump shots a day, but I don't live there anymore so I can't do that any longer. I really only think the spot I need to improve in is my dribbling skills. I cant really count on my opposite hand for much of my dribbling because I feel like I have less control in my opposite hand. I also have trouble protecting the ball, and getting past defenders. I feel like I don't have any go-to dribble moves when I need to get past a defender.


I don't think I'll provide much more information because I don't want to make this take too long to read. If you need any more detail just tell me. Help is very much appreciated."	t5_2qhsv	True

In their 3-A contest with Chemawa, the Boomers were trailing 53-50 with one second left. When 6-foot 3 Boomer David Ammons got an inbound pass from Jackson Cross at the baseline, Ammons let it fly nearly full court to the basket and it banked in.

&gt;**Unfortunately the shot was deemed no good because no shot can count if it’s made with less than three seconds, unless it’s off a tip.** However, it’s a great watch. Our thanks to Joe and Cara Ammons for the video.

--[Source](http://www.newslincolncounty.com/?p=72002)

I have never heard of this. Googling has turned up nothing except a couple of recent news stories that directly contradict this -- wherein the winning shot was made with 3 or fewer seconds left on the clock. Is this really a relatively unknown rule, or did the ref just want to go home? (If the full-court shot had counted, it would have tied the game and led into overtime.)"	t5_2qhsv	True

Now I play a slower PG style than him. But what tips could you guys give someone that wants to project a confident vocalrole without coming across like a bossy-takes the game too serious player

1335100173.0	smknc	Looking for ideas for a dunk contest.	wittyrandomusername	5	2	4	"I asked this in [/r/AskReddit](/r/AskReddit) and nobody cared.  Maybe I'll have better luck with actual basketball fans here.

I'm playing in a basketball tournament with my brother in a week and a half and they have a slam dunk contest. I can barely touch the rim, but my brother can get up there pretty good. We were trying to think of ideas for a creative dunk and I figured I'd ask Reddit.
To give some idea of his athletic ability, my brother is 6'4"" and he can easily do a 360 dunk. He can't quite put it down from the free throw line though.
He really wants to get creative about this. All the guys who participate are athletic so it won't be enough to show off his jumping ability. We are trying to think of something creative that hasn't been done before. Something that will surprise the crowd.
My idea was that I stand in the crowd with a basketball making sure that nobody knows that he's my brother or that we even know each other. Then he'll take his ball, throw it up like he's going to alley oop it to himself, and I'll throw my ball up and he'll dunk that one instead. Or maybe even dunk both of them.
Any other ideas are greatly appreciated.
If we come up with any good ideas, I'll make sure I post the video on here."	t5_2qhsv	True

1327816315.0	p1fej	It's my first time coaching a youth basketball team...I could really use some advice	BiscuitBasket	7	3	17	"So I was asked at the last minute to accept the position as head coach of a local park's girls minor basketball team (ages 8 to 10).  I was completely unprepared for this, but I said yes.  

Unfortunately I have zero coaching experience; however, I have a good understanding of the game itself since I played the sport on a team for 10 years.

I am intensely passionate about playing basketball, yet I have a hard time motivating the girls since I am a generally soft-spoken young woman. Also, most girls on my team have never played the sport before.

We have been losing games and I am becoming frustrated with myself.  Does anyone have any advice for a first-time coach in a youth girls' league? 

Any small bits of guidance will be greatly appreciated =]
