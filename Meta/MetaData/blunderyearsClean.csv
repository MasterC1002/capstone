Don't abuse the power or I will send you a strongly worded letter. (lolreferences)

Sincerely, me, on behalf of all mods.

EDIT: Just a quick impromptu poll: What are your guise's opinions on removing rude comments? While on one hand it can prevent hurt feelings and keep people posting on this sub, on the other it *could* promote fishing for compliments and reduce quality of submissions. These are just hypothetical observations, and I'd like everyone's opinion on this.

**EDIT 2: Super serious edit so bold because serious.**

I added a new rule regarding creepy comments and compliments. I've noticed a lot of genuine comments such as 'aw, you're gorgeous!' get downvoted into oblivion, along with creepy-ass comments like *""I will devour your young and sniff your eyeliner""* (God I hope no one ever said that). Just a reminder that we shouldn't shun compliments, but we shouldn't fish for them either. Important difference!

Basically the point of this story was for my friend to play out her romantic fantasies with Jacob Black and Nick Jonas and for me to show the fanfiction.net community how much of a badass I was. The end result is a mary sue fic with the shittiest plot development ever.

By far the worst part about this story is that my friend and I started going back through and editing it about 2 years after we had originally written it. Unfortunately, we never finished rewriting the original story so there is a jump in the chapters where the writing declines and the plot changes dramatically.

   Treadmills are the low of human existence. People forcing themselves to run like gerbils on a wheel. Focusing their attention on the glaring screen trying to burn just a few more calories or run just one more mile. Sweating as they march to the drumbeat of pounding feet.

That isn’t to say I haven’t wasted countless tiring hours trapped on this machine of death in a stuffy twenty by twenty foot room. I can sing every one of my workout playlists on my iPod from memory. I have forced my weary lactic acid-soaked muscles to run for hours a day.

While treadmills are perfect for getting down to a perfect sickly size zero, running on them saps the soul from you like a child endlessly tugging on a loose thread on his shirt.

Take a walk outside. The crisp air slices your lungs like a knife. The birds sing their infinite dance. An old man smiles and waves as he walks his small furry dog. The pine trees tickle your nose.

Walking doesn't have to be physical. Learn French and sip tea under the Eiffel Tower. Ride your bike to the grocery store and eat creamsicles in the park. Look at the big crowd of people eroding the streets of Seattle every day. Peer at every cell in your hand. Invent the word 'obular' and get all your friends to use it. Pretend you can
never fail.

Walk through the world don't run in a cave.

1366767906.0	1czamq	A Talent Show Story: Rollerblades and a Bucket of Nails		64	3	6	"I performed in my elementary school's talent show when I was in fourth grade and that day has since gone down as the most embarrassing day of my life.

I spent much of my free time in elementary school rollerblading in the driveway behind my family's house. I never did anything spectacular; I just really liked spending my time rollerblading. I was really into extreme sports too back then. I couldn't jump or do tricks on a skateboard or anything, so my next best option was rollerblading. I got my jumps down pretty well for my standards back then, which was probably no more than one foot high. Regardless, I thought I was hot shit on rollerblades back then.

I heard my school was holding a talent show and I saw this as my chance to show off my rollerblading skills.

I decided to perform in my school's talent show and here was my performance: I got up on stage and roller bladed in circles while music was playing. Then came my big finale. Being the daredevil I was, I brought a bucket of nails on stage and then jumped over it.

In retrospect, I realize that performance was nothing close to spectacular. I wasn't booed off stage or anything, but I wasn't cheered on by the crowd. I can only wonder what was going through the audience's head that day.

It's nice to see that I'm not the only person that considers themselves to be total dweebs when they were younger. Hopefully you all have gotten a kick out of this story."	t5_2vy3g	True

I just discovered this subreddit. Yes, it's funny to look back on how silly some of you looked. 

However, I was just a boring kid in high school (2001-2005). I was too afraid to express myself, experiment, or rebel. I never fit it, even with the misfits. I wanted to be a misfit. I loved punk. I wanted to be a punk. I wanted blue hair. My parents said hell no. The punk in me said, ""fuck authority!"" In reality, I said ""ok"" and respected their wishes. Not very punk right? 

My biggest regrets are not styling myself how I wanted and asking permission for everything. I missed my chance to be silly and develop a unique style. I'm out in the real world now where I just can't dress like an idiot any more.

Around 2006 I was tired of being a sheltered suburban kid. And so I stayed up late, watched porn on my dads computer, [and ran a website for 2 years, that I thought was the coolest website in existence.](http://www.freewebs.com/90scartoonsandgoodones/) 

Yeah. 
I joined a hate site aimed at over religious people and started a massive spam campaign on the freewebs public forums and used spoof accounts to frame someone of a massive spam attack. [You can see this for yourself here.](http://imgur.com/a/sBAF6)

[So one day I thought it would be fantastic to just take a picture and say that I was an international bounty hunter who knew how to kill everything with blood in it. Damn I was a natural born killer mang.](http://i.imgur.com/of7WSJS.jpg)

It was about then that I decided that I wanted to get into the gothic style subculture, but I had no friends, no money, and religious parents who sure as hell weren't going to finance a ""devilish campaign"" (My mom's words not mine.) So I stuck to wearing black cargo shorts and a studded belt and telling all my friends that I was a goth. Damn I was such a rebel. 

I also got off on taking screenshots from my totalitarian city in ""Sim City Societies."" (Which I thought was the greatest game of all time.) And putting vague not funny captions on them. 

Eventually my mom and dad caught me sneaking downstairs to use the internet at night and I was busted pretty bad. My sister also ratted on me staying up late and all. I got banned from the computer for almost 2 years. D: 

So since then I've grown up a lot. I've got a promising job lined up as a firefighter, I start training in a few months. I finally have money to spend on the stuff that I want and have always been into cyber goth trends along with my friends. I'm okay at industrial dancing and just try and be a good guy during the day and a freak at night. Maybe in 10 years I'll find some pictures from this time in my life and post them here. XD

Oh man that felt good to get off my chest.

~~Also please don't forget, I am watching you~~[I mean taking pictures with my mom's digital camera while no one is home.](http://i.imgur.com/zFUKQGA.jpg)

**YOU'RE AWESOME**

Despite the huge popularity we reached in a little more than three months (would you believe it? Seems such a longer time), with our almost 8k user and a [great feature](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/18xs7s/february_21_2013_rblunderyears_because_you_now/) in /r/subredditoftheday, we managed to keep the submission level high and the comments civilized, welcoming and *totally cute*.

That's quite an amazing achievements, and I'd like to thank you all.

Since you're this amazing we rarely had to moderate anything, but it's a nice day outside so I'd like to thank my fellow moderators /u/VonSandwich and /u/Seriou for their amazing work.

So, yeah, thanks and keep it coming. You're sweet, funny, and I don't know if it happens to the rest of you but sometimes I almost miss my blunderous past when looking at your pics.

**NOW FOR THE NEWS**

We have a new moderator! A warm welcome to /u/Nordoisthebest, who had the great idea of assigning submission-related flair and found himself burdened by the dubious honour of bringing it to life.

If you submitted something and would like to have arbitrary flair, [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fblunderyears)!

Finally, **HEADER**.

We're a serious sub, now, so we could use a better header. If you'd like your next submission to be included, please tag it with [h] or message us with a link (we don't want to go around stealing pics).

That's all for now, I guess - see you in another three months (="	t5_2vy3g	True

1372606796.0	1hd9k8	"Now is the time, fellow closet Lolita Fashion fans. Bring on the ""I'm too poor to afford this style"" pictures."	animalcule	4	6	3	"I'm secretly (at least in real life) a huge fan of lolita style. However i do not own any legitimate lolita stuff, and i don't plan to buy any. That said, i do love the cutesy aesthetic, and sometimes strive to emulate it in my everyday clothing. 

I REGRET TO SAY THAT I DO NOT HAVE A PICTURE WITH ME (and i'm out of the country so i can't take one now) but this last december i was quite inspired by the Oujisama (prince style, and yes i'm a girl)  subgenre of lolita fashion. My outfits essentially consisted of some variation of the following:
Black leggings
Black boots
Trouser shorts
Button down blouse
Ridiculous giant floppy bow thing worn around my neck as a tie

I really have no idea why i'm sharing this, (i mean, i still think it's cool, so i ain't outta this blunder year yet) but i urge my fellow secret lolita fans to reveal their terrible 'inspired by lolita fashion' attempts.

I'm missing 6th and 8th grade, but the rest are here (10th grade was the year I dropped out.) I straight up refused to ever take care of my hair, never combed/brushed and only washed it every once in a while. I think I look okay now.
