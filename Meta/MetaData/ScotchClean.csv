1357623600.0	16633d	I am drunk	wrestlingfan007	1084	252	290	"I hav abused scotch tonight. I think this goes underrated in this reddit. Scotch is great. Everyone tries to church it up like it isn;t mainly there to make us feel great, but it's quite wonderous. Today I got a call from Sallie Mae. I'm defaulting on 50K of student loans. This will ruin my credit and damage my chances of ever moving out of my parent's place. I'm 28. My girlfriend broke up with me AFTER I moved back from LA to Chicago. I have no job, despite applying to 84 jobs in the past week and never being fired or let go from a job since I was 13. I couldn't even make out with a woman tonight after 8 glasses of Glen 15 year old, since my psyche is shattered.

Scotch is there for me. I am not an alcoholic. But sometimes, nothing is better than scotch. Nothing.

EDIT: Thanks everyone. No, I am not an alcoholic. Thanks for the genuine concern and the biting comments, but before last night I hadn't had a drink in over a week and a half. It's odd to see this, my drunken rambling, on the front page. So it goes. I will say this though; lots of people have it worse than I do. No matter how bad things are, it's sadly comforting to know I can still drink scotch (It was a 12 year old Glen, I'm saving the Caol Ila for when I get a job) and watch The World is Not Enough on my couch at home, yelling obscenities at Denise Richards and her horrid acting, like when I was 13. You know, except for the scotch part. Anyway, I'm not sure what else to say. I generally just lurk on subreddits and leave stupid comments that don't get upvotes. The anonymity of the internet is generally a turnoff to me, but 99% of you seem like genuine good people, so I hope everything works out for me but more importantly for all of you with similar stories you shared. As long as there's free wi-fi in coffee shops and libraries, I'll be there applying to jobs. Like some kind of jobless shit Batman.

I'm a film major. Here's this thing someone edited for my favorite director. Enjoy? And thanks:

Three men sit down in a bar, an Irishman, an Englishman and a Scot.  Having gotten their drinks and sat down, a fly lands in each of their glasses.

The Irishman looks at his Guinness with a fly floating in the head, flicks it off with an urgent finger, and downs the entire glass.  The Englishman sees the fly swimming around in his tea.  He daintily removes the offending creature with a spoon, and continues to sip.  The Scot looks down at his Scotch, grabs the fly by the wings and while holding him above the glass yells ""ARRIGHT YOU!  SPIT IT UUT"" "	t5_2qq65	True

What scotch upon consumption will most powerfully bind their souls to our interests? 
Thanks for your help!

Nose was wrong, first sip was off; I called over my waitress and asked if the bartender poured the wrong year, telling her it was the G12, not 15. Turns out they were out of 15 so the bartender just poured the 12. They apologized and I just finished my drink. Turns out 12 &amp; 15 are the same price anyway so wouldn't have been a financial loss. Kind of proud, and kind of ashamed at the same time. Ha.

We would love to have more participation and discussions going on daily from all of you who have yet to speak up.  It may look intimidating to post your questions or thoughts on Scotch Whisky but believe me, there's nothing I like better than discussion on any whisky topic here.

So what would you like to talk about?

What would help you not lurk?

I know some people just like to read stuff and be left alone, thats fine, but I'm sure there are some people on our sub that just don't know enough on the topic and might be intimidated to post or ask questions.

Balvenie has responded to me in interest of doing an AMA, so go ahead and start asking your questions. 

 For those unfamiliar with our AMA style here on the whisky network:  we populate a list of questions here and then I send them off to the distillery to be answered at their leisure.  That way they have plenty of time to answer as thoroughly as possible and usually every question gets answered as opposed to a celeb on iama that only answers 4 questions in 10 minutes and then leaves.  the only downside to this is there will be no live followup questions, so pose your questions are well thought out as you can. 

Pose your questions as if you're asking questions directly to the Distillery please.  Don't waste your questions on things like:  where do you like to Golf or whats your favorite TV program... these kinds of questions aren't very helpful and will most likely be removed.  

our other AMA's can be found in the Whisky Guide:  [LINK](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ibxWwtYEc6ZTTDtDrSBm25a3qvqJXeGrInl9wClTup4/edit#bookmark=id.pw1l21r95atb)

**Now the “fun” part -** 

Since we have gained so many, it is time to institute the “Laws”. 

[This document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Aici57rSYriWTBd6P9Q64mgoRnzk_9l7EEhFOhKdEnY/edit)  has been put together by the /r/scotch mods in order to maintain... order.  We all want to keep this sub running clean and filled with good content.  These rules are subject to change/amendments.  We’re going to try to be strict, but we are pretty easy going.

Honestly we have had very little problems with any of the things in our new rules and you guys are really great at policing this sub with a little help from us already.  

But, we also do not want to have a problem in the future.  Little will change really, we seem to currently have one of the most mature subs on Reddit, so lets keep it that way. Downdrams may waste whisky, but only if the post is a good one. So remember Reddiquette as well as these rules.

Okay dramming on,

**Contest Announcement!:** 

Now that we have turned 10k, to celebrate we are holding a contest.  **Design our new /r/Scotch Logo!**  I designed the current logo about 6 months ago and it could use some new blood.

Here is the deal:: 

* Design a new Logo that would fit in the current area.  (same practical size)

* We would like to have the Reddit Alien/Glencairn design worked in but it isn’t mandatory.  

* Submissions for this contest should not be posted here but in the **[SUBMISSION FORM HERE.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEFETzFFb0I1elEtVDItaHBWblhnZmc6MQ#gid=0)**  

* Create your logo, upload to imgur and submit with your name.

* The mods will review all the entries and choose the best/most appropriate one.

* Entries can be submitted for 1 week, starting right now, so lets see those artistic skills at work!

The Prize for the winning entry, besides getting your work displayed with bragging rights,  is to pick an upcoming community review for everyone - as long as its something widely available and Scotch.

---

       
 Now everyone raise your glass!
    
     *May the best you've ever seen
    
    Be the worst you'll ever see;
    
    May a moose ne'er leave yer girnal
    
    Wi' a teardrop in his e'e.
    
    May ye aye keep hale and hearty
    
    Till ye're auld enough tae dee,
    
    May ye aye be just as happy
    
    As I wish ye aye tae be.*

I noticed that there's a pretty strong anti-rocks sentiment here on r/scotch, and I wanted to put in my two cents.  

I like ice.  I like the way it chills the scotch as you drink it.  I like the way it makes the glass feel.  I like the way it opens up the scotch.  I like the way it changes the taste and exposes different flavors as it melts.  I like putting the cold scotch in my mouth and feeling it warm against my tongue.  I like going from the diluted last sip of the first glass to the full strength first sip of the second.

I realize that a ""real"" scotch drinker only drinks it neat.  I have nothing against drinking scotch neat and I do it often.  But I prefer my scotch on the rocks.

99% of the time when I'm drinking scotch, it's a Laphroaig 10 or 15, Glenlivet 12 or 18, Johnny Walker Green, Glenfiddich 12, or Balvenie 15.  All are scotches that I thoroughly enjoy, but hardly what you'd call ""top of the line"".  I find it a bit amusing that so many people seem to be offended at the thought of dropping a couple cubes into a glass with one of these pours.  The thought that the ice is going to destroy the ""purity"" of these drinks is laughable.  I'm not an expert taste-tester, nor are these liquors that would be considered so pristine that they ought not to be touched.

My opinion is that each person's opinion on rocks vs. neat should be their opinion. We don't all like the same scotch, and that's generally accepted and respected.  Whether someone likes a cube or two in their scotch should be treated the same way.

*~*  Obviously, if you're going to use ice, you should use common sense and make your cubes out of filtered water and don't use ice that's been sitting in your freezer forever.

**TL;DR** Ice makes me feel funny in the pants."	t5_2qq65	True
1354637181.0	149ljr	I asked Ralfy his thoughts on Macallan.  Here is his response. 	texacer	149	22	114	"hello again (Texacer),  
. . .  what's going on with Macallan ?    simple ! (this is my opinion) the brand has changed from being a great whisky to just a good whisky with increasingly disappointing bottlings becoming more frequent as sales volumes increase.
The reason ?   . . . a conservative institution of a business which like so many reputable British businesses has lost wholistic focus through over-budgeting of marketing along with dis-investing in cost of production whilst overseen by detached short-termist senior management who probably can't even send an e-mail without a secretary to do it for them.     . . .   a fairly typical situation in Little Britain p.l.c. 
Age statements have been removed on bottles so that (in my opinion) younger whisky can be sold at older-whisky prices further reducing production costs.

Orthodox (and fairly boring) marketing accounts in modern whisky corporations for up to 25% of the cost of a standard bottle.    . .  . far too much, as unfortunately, without being too cynical, marketing departments are more powerful when the self-selling quality of the product is weakened due to inferior quality, thus marketing gets more budget (and bonuses) to sell the stuff.

The solution to this situation is for the customer (or 'consumer' as marketing likes to say) not buy when quality is not right,    after all, quality is what we pay for and most certainly are charged for.

The sulphur issue has become the fashionable ""bad thing' to talk about in whisky as some businessmen/journalists seek to sell books and magazine articles including the fact that some (mainly sherry matured) whiskies are tainted by sulphur candles being burnt in ex-sherry casks to  sterilise them.
It is common knowledge amongst proper time-served coopers that some poor quality/rancid sherry casks have been over-sulphured in Spain to mask the bad quality of the casks, and this is usually remedied by long-steep cask rinsing,  however some Malts like Mortlach and Bowmore have benefited from the presence of natural sulphur present in the spirit (forming during distillation) and which contributes to the over-all complexity of the malts (if present in small quantities)

As you will notice, there is increasingly more and more 'flannel' appearing about Scotch,   and my advice is simple.

- Don't let yourself buy into the hype !
- Continue to trust your own judgement and be fussy, especially with the cost involved.
- When you get a bad bottle, e-mail the Distillery and complain.   It is better they hear from you than you silently ceasing to buy their product.
- Explore on-line the quality of World spirits like rum, bourbon and the exciting new stuff that is appearing from around the World and is increasingly a valid and cheaper option to Scotch.
- keep an eye on the small, craft Scotch producers who don't chill-filter, don't add E150a and who bottle at higher strength.   It's a sure sign they are trying harder.

I hope this helps !

Hello boys and girls of Scotchit, Ardbeg_head here with a rather special treat for you all. I recently got into contact with David Mair, Balvenie's Global Brand Ambassador who has kindly agreed to do an IAMA for us. I will be leaving this IAMA question round open until the next monday when I will send him your questions and post when he responds. For those of you who asked questions on the original post, don't worry your questions will be included. So here are some questions from me to get the ball rolling:

* While at the distillery you told me that your 17 YR Peated Cask was aged in casks that formerly held peated Balvenie (I may be wrong about this fact). Are there plans to do anything with that peated whisky?

* How would you describe the character of Balvenie?

* Have you ever had any single malt from Kininvie and if so what did you think?

* Balvenie is one of the few distilleries that still does traditional floor maltings. About what percentage of barely do you still malt on site?"	t5_2qq65	True

Hi guys, MSheinberg here with an update on the private label. My supplier called today and told me that they needed an answer by the end of the week as to whether or not we're going to go through with the project. Otherwise, there are other buyers that are interested. 

For those of you who need a refresher, here's what we're talking about: A cask of Aberlour distilled in 2000 and bottled earlier this year (12 yrs). The label will indicate that it was bottled especially for /r/scotch and possibly have the reddit alien on it. The price would be $70 plus tax and shipping. 

I am a retailer in New York City, having done this personally for nigh on 10 years and my current place of employment has been in operation since the 1940s.

Thus far I've had 16 bottles ordered, out of the 60 that I need to make this happen. To order a bottle, we would need to have a phone conversation (pm me for the phone number). 

There are certain states I cannot ship to (I'll find the list I posted later on). If you have any questions, please feel free to PM me or leave a comment. I hope we can make this happen but I need firm commitments from everyone before I can put the order in (otherwise I'm going to be stuck with 44 bottles of reddit scotch that I won't be able to sell to anyone!)

**tl;dr We need people to order 40 more bottles by the end of the week. PM or comment for details.**

**As of 10am we are up to 20 bottles ordered!**

**Also, [here is the list of states I cannot ship to] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/uj1mf/scotchit_bottlings/c4w1nx2)**

As of Oct 30, 2012 there are 1713 reviews in the database, which is fairly significant. I did a quick analysis of the data behind it and the results are presented below. Thanks to everyone (mods, reviewers, texacer) for making this possible!

What are scotchit habits? Who are our top reviewers? Which scotch should you try? I won't be making too many conclusions and will let the data speak for itself.

**When?** 

 * [Number of reviews per month](http://i.imgur.com/j93Hs.png). Reviews have really been picking up in 2012!

 * [Number of reviews per day](http://i.imgur.com/ttp10.png). Thursday it is. Surprisingly high number of reviews during the week-end considering reddit usual activity at that time.

___

**What?**

* The average reviewed whisky was 13.6 years old and cost $63.3 (USD) (and was rated 84.0)

I held my wedding at a fairly fancy restaurant last weekend and we had a champagne/cocktail in the garden outside before the meal. They have a decent scotch list, and so after the champagne, I started sipping on Lagavulin 16. I recommended it to a few friends and before long about a dozen or so people, including my lovely wife, were drinking it, heavily. 

Towards the end of the cocktail, the maitre d' came up to me and said, ""Sir, I apologize but the next one will have to be a Laphroaig, you have exhausted our supply of Lagavulin."" 

The cocktail really started to warm people up for a great evening and I was so proud of my invitees!

To clarify, I also really like Laphroaig, I just felt very satisfied hosting a party where we actually drank the restaurant out of the Lagavulin. 

TL,DR - my wedding guests drank the restaurant out of Lagavulin 16 and I had a great night.

[In light of a recently popular post with an unfortunate amount of incomplete information](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/nu498/single_malt_scotch_whisky_is_gluten_free/), I felt it important to reiterate this, and make another thread for it, because I do not want my response to be buried in a long list of replies. The effects of gluten intolerance are not life-threatening, but still uncomfortable enough that I would like people to actually read the correct information.

[We have had this discussion before,](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/lac9c/i_received_heartbreaking_news_today/) and I fact-checked with a physician (gastro-enterologist in my hospital) afterwards. I feel qualified to refute the previous post because have about 12 years of experience reading about whisky, because I have a PhD in Analytical Chemistry (separation sciences), and because I am currently being trained to be in charge of a hospital laboratory, in which one of our occupations is the diagnosis of Celiac Disease. I apologize in advance if anyone feels offended by my reply. I just want to be as clear as possible.



**The following will be a longish explanation on whisky and celiac disease:**

Most people with gluten-allergy have an intolerance for gliadine, a prolamine, which is basically a protein with sugar-molecules attached. These are soluble both in water and alcohol.


Distillation is a simple separation based on boiling point. When trying to separate a mixture of two substances, like ethanol and water, heating up makes the substance with the lower boiling point evaporate first, rise in the still and be separated from the other substance. However, when most of the first substance has evaporated, some of the second will evaporate before all of the first has. In the case of water and ethanol, which form an azeotrope, a lot of the second compound will have evaporated. Thus, you will never get a 100% pure distillate, unless you repeat the process. This is why your standard chemistry class distillation column had all these little compartments, in order to have multiple serial distillation processes going on. The number of processes in one column is called the plate number, and the higher it is the more pure the distillate will be.


Whisky however is a mixture of countless compounds. Proteins will theoretically not evaporate at all, but in practice, some will transfer with the solvents. Not much, but still some. The more plates, the less protein, or other contaminants. A pot still has one plate, a coffey still has 20+. This is why triple distillation removes prolamines more efficiently than double, and grain whisky is even better. 


The effect of these small amounts of substances on your body will vary hugely from person to person. Some people will have no response to whisky at all, but in severe cases of celiac disease, minor amounts of these compounds can already trigger the immune response. I advice everyone with celiac disease to figure out what they can and can not drink by trial and error.



**TL;DR Single Malt scotch is NOT gluten free, because distillation of a water-alcohol mixture is a very inefficient process, and not all compounds that trigger the immune system are removed. The amounts of gluten in Scotch will be low, but the response within patients with Celiac Disease will vary immensely**

Hi Scotchiters, MSheinberg here with an update on the private label scotch. I just got off the line with the supplier and got some info for y'all...some good, and some bad.

They will be sending me a sample of the Aberlour 2000 next week as soon as the 86 proof samples come in (they have a cask strength sample available now, but I'd rather taste and review what we would all be receiving in the bottle).

As for the label itself, here's what I found out.

* The label will say ""The Classic Cask Single Barrel Scotch bottled exclusively for __________""  (we fill in the blank. Mods, please let me know how you'd like the blank filled out)

* If we want an image (say, of the Reddit alien), they need it in .eps format.

Now for the bad news: The price I was quoted was for an entire cask (64 cases of 6 bottles/case). If we were to do only 60 bottles, my costs would go up dramatically, as the bottles are already stateside and would need to be relabeled here; as such, the price is actually $70, not the $60 that I was originally quoted. 

I am very, very sorry about this. I was going on the salesman's information, and the information I'm quoting today is from the company's VP.

So we are at a crossroads: We can do one of 3 things:

* Go with the private label for 60 bottles at $70

* Go with the regular label for 60 bottles at $60

* Drop the project altogether

Those of you who have already given me your info, please PM me and tell me what you'd like me to do with your information. If you want me to keep your order, destroy it, etc. 

Again, I sincerely apologize for the misinformation that I had given earlier. If the community could please weigh in on the options I mentioned above, that would be greatly appreciated. 

Let the flaming on me begin....

**ORDER UPDATE** As of **6/14 at 7pm,** I have 11 confirmed reservations of the scotchit bottle. These are people who have either called or emailed me and given me name, address, cc# to reserve a bottle. I've had lots of others say that they were interested but haven't gone as far as to give me a cc to reserve the bottle(s). Now, some of these are people who said ""yes"" when the price was $60 but haven't let me know either way, yet, about the $70 price, so this count could change.

Also, I've gotten some hard commitments from people outside the US border...these I'm not counting, yet, until I can confirm that I can ship to y'all one way or another, but just putting it out there.

For those of you who missed the earlier threads, and are interested in purchasing a bottle (or bottles) please PM me and I'll tell you what I need to secure a bottle.

**Edit 6/14 1:15pm EDT** [This is a list of states I cannot ship to] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/uj1mf/scotchit_bottlings/c4w1nx2)

The glass came over and I sipped, all sherry - no smoke. I took the glass up to the bar and, using my best Texacer impression, explained to them why I thought it was wrong. 

It turned out they ran out of Lagavulin and, because scotch it scotch to them, doled out a Glenmorangie instead. They were embarrassed, but I played it cool and took a free drink while schooling the barmaids on the finer points of scotch producing regions.

**PLEASE upvote the thread for visibility. I don't get karma for text postings. Let all of Scotchit see what we can do!**

This thread is going to determine the scotchit bottling for the community. Please upvote your preferred dram.

[Again, if you live in one of the restricted states] (/r/Scotch/comments/uj1mf/scotchit_bottlings/c4w1nx2), I can't ship to you, I'm sorry. I can hold it in the store for you to pick up in person (or via a local agent) or ship it somewhere legally and you get it from them somehow. 

International Scotchiters, I am in the process of finding out from UPS what the legalities are regarding shipping internationally. I should have an answer by the end of the week. 

As a reminder, here are the ground rules:
I will need an order for 60 bottles (or multiples of 6 thereafter) to make the purchase with a special /r/scotch label and with the pricing listed. If this falls through, I can still get these products, but the price will be $10-20 higher, depending on the product. I will get hard commitments from the members of the community once the bottle is decided.

Please feel free to ask questions either in this thread or in PM if you need clarification. So...without further ado...

EDIT: Help me keep this on the front page and allow voting through the weekend. I'll announce the winner and what the next steps are on Monday. I'll talk to my supplier and find out what details are needed, etc. as I get everyone's billing/shipping info."	t5_2qq65	True

Then, the SO and I went to the local beer garden and hipster gourmet pizza place for date night last night, and after taking the world tour of the Victory taps I was a little gooned.  We both had to be up early, so we didn't stay out after dinner, we just went by the Walgreens for some cheap theater candy and a Red Box.  We also decided to pop in to the liquor store because she wanted to look for some Framboise.

We are complete assholes when it comes to our alcohol.

Anyway, where I live we really only have one liquor store that isn't attached to a grocery store, and it's run locally.  So the booze is a little pricier than normal, but still cheaper than what's around me.  For example, a bottle of Glenlivet 18 runs around $80-$90 instead of ~$70.  It's also the only place to find good whisky.  It's a hard knock life for me, I know.

Regardless, still a little goofy from the beer (and to be honest, this morning I'm still a little goofy from the beer and also the scotch), I went in to 6-year-old impulse buy mode and decided to get my reward bottle then and there.  I decided, in spite of myself and what I really thought my palate was like, to get a nice heavy peated Islay whisky.

I picked up a bottle of Laphroaig 18.  This is no official /r/scotch review, no sir, I don't have the time for that.  But sweet Mary and Moses, after taking that first sip I thought I was drinking barbecued Jesus.  I'm pretty sure my dead Scottish Grandpa came back to life for just a few minutes to tell me how proud of me he was and if I'd been outside in a meadow I would have been surrounded by cheerfully big-eyed cartoon woodland critters gracing me with flowers and song.

The nose was so increadibly heady and rich, full of smoke, that I started to get hungry (I live in the southern US, where BBQ is a recognized religion on the Census forms).  The rounded, buttery sweetness and long, drifting earthen and spiced aftertaste almost made me weep.

In 6 months I will be broke and homeless because I spent all my rent money on Laphroaig 18.

1366635854.0	1cuzqw	Ontario Whisky Shopping Heads Up, or How I had security called on me 4 times	TOModera	99	17	68	"Hi all! Originally I was going to add this story onto two of my reviews, however I've come down with a cold recently, and alcohol + cold = headaches. I wanted to pass on this story to others, as it's mildly helpful for people shopping for booze in Ontario. Apologies for rambling a little bit.

A bit of background: I live in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. One of the few places you can buy spirits is the Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO). They are government controlled and owned. 

A week ago, someone (I think it was UncleToby) requested a review of Belgian Owl. I like to follow up on requests when I can (which is rare), and was very surprised to see that a store near me had a clearance on it (which is really rare). It was the Bayview Village LCBO. I went in on a Friday, and proceeded to slowly walk around, perusing the 5 whisky sections, as my wife drove to pick me up. She was in traffic (welcome to Toronto), and took 35 minutes to get there.

After 20 minutes, I decided to go pick up the whisky I was going to buy (The Belgian Owl and the Bowmore Discovery Pack), as I had stared at the fine selection of IB and high end whisky they had for long enough. It was at that point, as I picked it up, that an announcement came over asking for ""Security to the Scotch section"". I froze, not moving, waiting for someone to walk up and ask me what I was doing. Or ask the other two people what they were doing. No one showed.

Compounding my natural paranoia is the fact that it was Friday, and thus I was in jeans, a leather jacket, not shaved, and in a more upscale mall. When no one showed up, I moved to the Canadian Whisky section (one meter, or 4 feet away). Again, security was called to my new section. I moved a meter again, this time to the rum section, where it was called again. 

I moved away, waited around, and no one talked to me. I later went over to the Ontario white wine section to look for wines for my wife, and had security called again.

To say that I was worried is an understatement. I walked to the middle of the building, and stood there waiting for my wife. Once she showed up, we walked around again, and had no issues.

Later on I decided to make a complaint, and had two excellent people follow up with me. It turns out that the LCBO has a new system when they are busy; in order to improve customer service, they'll call security to an area if it looks like someone can't find what they are looking for. This store didn't follow up with the whole ""helping me"" situation, and as such they apologized and are sending me a gift card to make up for it. Perhaps I'll pick up [The South Island Single Malt (18 year)](http://thenzwhisky.com/products/sism.html).

**Moral of the Story (TL; DR):** If you're shopping in an LCBO and security is called, it's because they think you need help, not because they think you're a malcontent. Wait for them to show up, explain what you're doing, and go to the tasting bar (if they have one)."	t5_2qq65	True

also if anyone finds a ""dead review"" let me know and i'll delete it.  I found one this week when putting together the [newbie suggestions doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P-BPHpjGkGM6g1vlrAEXms_G-3jNr78Yh_r3_YpW2Iw/edit?pli=1).  which btw now we need a review of Chivas.

Sup Scotchit,

Muttur here for a review of the Rolls Royce of Sherry Drams. Last weekend, I was at a destination wedding up in the Pocono Mountains (Upstate PA near Scranton / Dunder-Mifflin), and befriended the barkeep. After an hour or so of babbling back and forth about scotch, the Macallan trophy stand (in the background of the picture I'm submitting) got the best of me; all the usual players were there, 10, 12, 18, CS.... but they had the prized 30. 

I told the barkeep how I'd do anything short of manslaughter to one day get at that sexy, 30yr old Brunette after already having many a go at her 18 and Cask Strength sisters. He walked over and poured me a dram. About an ounce and a half pour. 

""No charge, just because you're a Scotch lover. But don't tell anyone.""

I was beside myself, not just at the generosity, but the sheer fact that the pour he gave me ran for about $165/dram, as the full bottle is a cool grand per 750mL. In any case, ON TO THE REVIEW!

**Review #2:** Macallan 30yr old Sherry Oak 43% ABV

**Ambiance:** Sitting at a quiet bar with no one except myself, my fiancee, and the bartender. I'm in front of a large window about half an hour past Sunset, overlooking a beautifully manicured Golf Course in the Mountains of PA. With a free pour of Mac 30. Holy Shit.

**Color**: Standard Macallan; Golden Honey-Brown

**Nose**: Sweet, floral; Heaven. Aromatic upfront, with the caramel and chocolate notes making a WAY more subtle appearance than its younger counterparts. No scent of alcohol to be found anywhere.

**Palate:** Cherries, Honey, Toffee, subtle hints of Oak and of course the Sherry. This stuff is nectar. The mouth-feel is medium in body, but not too over-powering in any of the different flavor profiles. This shit is balanced perfectly.

**Finish:** Caramel, Oak, Apricot / Some-Fruit-I-Can't-Place. The linger is mild; the overall finish is smoother than butter. Almost no taste of alcohol, no burn, and the fruit subsides into a final taste of the Oak. 

Essentially, this is the nectar of the gods. If I had to give it a comparison, which I feel would be unfair... I would say it's VERY close in flavor profile and mouth-feel to the Mac CS minus the intensity and burn factor. After the first few sips that I savored, I found this wonderful liquid disappearing way faster than a $165/glass dram should have. It's not overpowering in the Sherry department, and after every sip, a full 360 of flavors ranging from the Oak back to the Fruit subtly dance around in your mouth, with no burn to remind you that you're drinking Whiskey. Unbelievable.

Note that each match has a letter designation (e.g. A is Aberlour vs Glenfarclas) and these coordinate to the form, just enter the right whisky to the right fields and you're done. 

To make it easier I've put together a little template you can print or save a copy of so you can fill out, [you can find that here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Am71XDkWCyIhdFg4Sm5tWFU0Ymlwam9JbFVHTXVFdVE)

bonus you say?!

I ran across a really cool website called stattit.

It works with reddit to show stats of every sub and mod.  It's pretty cool

check this out:  http://stattit.com/r/scotch/

http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3462/3237880783_9809fc513f.jpg

I wanted something that I think packs more useful information and more accurate mapping of flavors.  I think I managed to *somewhat* pull it off, with over 50 single malt Scotch whiskies.  Here it is, in a 768x1024 landscape:

http://i.imgur.com/LJNja.jpg

Of course, this is still just a 'second draft' to me.  It is damn near impossible to put flavors of a whisky on a two-dimensional map, so take this with a grain of salt.  It's mainly meant to guide scotchit drinkers toward similar scotches they might enjoy, and have a rough purchasing flavor reference at a single glance.

If this gets everyone's approval I'm planning on making a more printer-friendly version for the fridge or whatever.  If it doesn't, I'm open to suggestions!! (Move this further this way, make it bigger/smaller, add this, remove this, you're missing X crucial malt, etc).

Hope you like it!  Cheers, gentlemen.

**EDIT:**  Sorry about the spelling mistake on Laphroaig.  It will be fixed along with some other things when I can get back on the lappy (charger broke, battery died).

**EDIT2:**  I will be fixing this more tomorrow since I have a bit of free time.  Found a replacement charger.  Right now I'm watching the Giants pummel the Panthers and I think a dram is in order.  Please don't think that this is strictly my project guys, I did a lot of this from personal opinion and reading others' reviews, so if you've tasted a few malts I'd love to hear your opinion on my placement."	t5_2qq65	True

This post is an update of [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/12d1bi/scotchit_reviews_an_analysis/), which in October 2012 analysed 1,713 archived reviews to extract information. Today the database has 3 times as many reviews - 4918 in total (excluding community reviews), made by 699 reviewers on 1,572 different whiskies, including 100 with 10 reviews or more, 202 with 5 reviews or more... and 1,011 with one review only. 

What are scotchit habits? Who are our top reviewers? Which scotch should you try? 

**When?** 

 * [Number of reviews per month](http://imgur.com/yABaYaI). Reviews peaked in Dec-Jan, however have been steady since then with around 300 reviews a month, or 10 a day!

 * [Number of reviews per day](http://i.imgur.com/xlfdNRs.png). The previous analysis showed that Thursday was the most popular day to review a scotch. However this has changed; while Sundays and Mondays aren't as busy, there is little difference between all days.

___

**What?**

* The average reviewed whisky was 13.7 years old, cost $63.3 (USD) and was rated 83.5. Based on this, the Glenmorangie Nectar D'Or would be an ""average"" whisky.

* [Distribution of reviewers' ratings](http://i.imgur.com/pI2SMi8.png) 6.3% of the reviews have a rating below 70, 5.3% have a rating above 95%.

* [Price distribution](http://i.imgur.com/JxeXvWm.png). 

* [Age distribution](http://i.imgur.com/xRyvAE5.png). (only extracted for scotchs with the age in the name... e.g. ""Glenlivet 12"" is taken into account, ""Green label"" isn't). The majority of reviewed scotchs were 12 years old.

___

**Who?**

Out of all 699 reviewers and 4918 reviews, 7 reviewers contributed to 20% of the reviews, 20 contributed to 40%, 50 contributed to 60%, 143 to 80% of the reviews. 

23 users have 50 reviews or more, 54 have 20 reviews or more.

The blue curve is the average rating, the red and green curves are the 10th and 90th percentile ratings (the minimum and maximum ratings were less revealing because of outliers). Ratings do increase with price, but what's your tipping point?

 * [Summary of rating and price by age](http://i.imgur.com/V4fIZvj.png). 30 years old are rated higher... are they worth the price?

**First off**, the mods have been catching a lot of people posting without [reading our rules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14FIs5UOo_n-djPrLwo0SvrOSdTaxP3UNLeaovO-RCVs/edit?pli=1) (specifically breaking rule #3). If you wish to post a picture, make sure you're adding some sort of explanation to the post to spark discussion. 

**Second**, remember the Aberlour 12 Double Cask Matured- Fortnight Archive Highlight is this Thursday. Feel free to post any and all reviews beforehand to add to the Highlight!

**Third**, I wanted to say thank you all for the incredible content you've all been providing to make this the great subreddit that it is. I was unable to participate in this week's Beginner Thread as I have in the past and I was astounded by the quality and maturity of the responses and how willing everyone was to help our many newbies. Not to mention all of the hard work put into your reviews, the new malt map, and other discussions. Seriously, I am in awe of what a great subreddit this continues to be. Thank you all for the quality content and the incredibly great discussions.

**Slainte,**

Greetings, malt mates! Thatguy here with the Reddit WhiskyNetwork roundup and Q&amp;A Volume 13.1! 

* Welcome to all of our new malt mates who have joined us over the past few weeks. This thread is the weekly Reddit WhiskyNetwork (comprised of /r/scotch, /r/worldwhisky, and our friends over at /r/bourbon, and other related subs) Roundup and Q&amp;A thread. The purpose of this thread is to not only to recap the goings-on within the network over the past week, but also to allow our malt mates (from beginner to expert) to ask questions about whisky. To our beginners, there are no dumb questions here so feel free to ask! I've seen a lot of posts lately about decanters, glassware, recommendations, and how to get started. This is the thread to get the definitive answer! So with that in mind, ***WELCOME AND PLEASE FEEL FREE TO ASK ANY WHISK(E)Y-RELATED QUESTION BELOW!***

1326743969.0	ojow7	Differentiating 'peat' from 'smoke'	KidUncertainty	77	6	46	"Alright.  Slowly, but surely, I am trying to build some awareness into my palate as I adventure through the land of single malts.   I am interested in expanding from the Speysides and Highlands into territory that borders on Islay and am trying to plot an appropriate migratory path.  One thing I struggle with is trying to define the difference between 'peat' and 'smoke'. 

It seems to me as though these are sometimes used interchangeably when I try to do research via Google, but perusing the FAQ seems to indicate that they are also different.  In that it seems like things that are heavily smoky tend to also be peaty, yet somehow you can get some level of peat without the smoke.  What would I be looking for in the nose/taste/finish for something that is peaty, but not smoky, and conversely, smoky but not peaty?

For example, I had the opportunity to sample a dram of Macallan 25 at a vertical tasting last year.  While it was somewhat milder/smoother than say, a cask strength or Macallan Sherry 18, but unlike all other (younger) Macallans that I've tasted, this particular pouring of the 25 had a 'smoke bomb' finish that would just erupt in the throat, mouth, and nose about 3-4 seconds after taking a sip.   It tasted precisely like I had inhaled a mouthful of campfire smoke.  Is this 'pure smoke' or would there be peaty aspects to this?

Perhaps someone could guide me towards something that would have differences in the two flavours/sensations so I could try to learn how to pick them out.  Currently I have to hand:

Aberlour 10, Balvenie Doublewood 12, Glenlivet Nadurra, Macallan Cask Strength. 
In the past, I've sampled Macallan 10, 12, 15 (Oak), 18, 25.  I've had a bottle of Glenfiddich 15.

I also have access to a local with a truly prodigious selection of whisky, whiskey, blends and malts, so if there is a couple things to try I can certainly spring for a dram or two for experiments instead of a whole bottle if it would aid in building appreciations.

TL;DR: How do I identify a 'peat' taste in contrast to 'smoke'?"	t5_2qq65	True

My girlfriend's parents recently redid their basement, and in tearing down some old wood paneling, found this unopened bottle of Haig &amp; Haig still in its box.  Next to the box were some letters dated 1939, so we have a feeling the bottle dates back to around then.  Does anyone have any info on this bottle beyond what a cursory Google search brings up?  Is this particularly rare, considering we still have the box?  Would it be worthwhile to attempt to sell, or should we just drink it?

I'm still new to scotch, so any help would be much appreciated!

Edit: Thanks for the help everyone.  I should have mentioned earlier that I'm aware whisky doesn't age in the bottle, though I have read that subtle changes can occur over decades.  I was mostly checking to make sure they won't be throwing away a small fortune when they eventually decide to drink it.  If I can somehow convince them to open it, I'll be sure to post a review."	t5_2qq65	True

I said you were a one trick pony (If trick ponies were actually shotguns filled with rock salt). I said, here on this very subreddit: ""There is no way I could sit back and enjoy a glass.""

**I was wrong**

You were there for me when I needed you the most. My coffee machine was broken, and I was writing a novel late at night. I ran out of inspiration. I needed a kickstart in the arse. And you saved me, you showed me the way, and you kept me *Alive*. I have you to thank for those memories, that awesome fight scene, and pushing past my quota. I drank you, and I kept drinking you. You are not just a neon light, you are truly a great scotch. Thank you."	t5_2qq65	True

1339464582.0	ux5b3	A tip for washing your glasses	Biomortis	78	7	29	There is no need to throw your whisky on the floor.  However, there is a grain of truth to the method.  Pretty much all of my glasses have a slight detergent smell after coming out of the dishwasher.  Even when I hand wash them, I can often detect a faint hint of fragrance.  I keep a bottle of Everclear (Golden Grain works too) on hand for rinsing as well as a couple other household chores. I don't care for denatured alcohol because of the benzene in it so I just pay the extra for the drinkable ethanol.  A little splash and swirl and dump in the sink and it pretty much removes anything that your whisky would pick up.  A little shake and it air dries fast.  While I don't always go to the trouble for a casual drink, I certainly do it for my higher end stuff and reviews as well.	t5_2qq65	True

1328618239.0	peljq	Gotta go :`(	BearPond	88	22	19	"Well, this is my farewell. Can I get a big scotchit hug?

I've stopped drinking (personal reasons), and it's been over a month now and to be honest, I don't miss it. I feel healthier and smarter and, well I feel great. For the most part... 

I mean, beer, I can live without. 

Wine, a small goodbye and I'm okay.

Spirits, cocktails, all the rest, well I guess I don't need to tell you that we were never good for each other. Fun, but ultimately a destructive force.

But scotch... oh scotch you sonnova bitch. Scotch was like a bit of me. Like a part of my personality, a fair chunk I'd say too. And now, this is goodbye. 

Goodbye Jameson, or ol' reliable as I came to know you. Goodbye Dimple and Black and Chivas and all of you. Even you Blue, although we only met a few times. 

I'll miss you all. Wahhhh.

r/Scotch, cheers, it's been real.

1365346597.0	1burf4	I share a whisky collection with friends, one of them made this online tracking app (open source) to show our stats and share the costs. Let me show you the features.	cybrbeast	75	10	12	"First [a picture](http://i4.minus.com/iUp0RGvy9sn9A.jpg) of our current stock. Since I share this collection with my friends we really needed a way to track each one's use so we could split the cost fairly.

For this my friend developed MALT: Malted Alcoholic Liquid Tracker. It works via an online interface hosted on our home server. It is also smart phone friendly.

Here is the [home screen](http://i2.minus.com/iyMuq8ECrt2PY.png). It shows what's currently in stock. It also shows how the total volume and price of our stock. And it shows how many drinks have been drunk since the tracker started.

This is the [drinks overview](http://i5.minus.com/iC3PM2oXMRQkc.png). Here you can see all recent drinks and who drank them. This is also where you [add a drink](http://i2.minus.com/iTUIw68u82XbA.png). This is a quick process since we use a measuring glass to always measure out 50ml glasses, and you can also add the drink via your smartphone.

You can also access the [personal stats](http://i2.minus.com/iSZ4puR8NQQjt.png) of each drinker. Such as total consumption, average price, and use over time. You can also see [which regions your drinks are distributed amongst](http://i6.minus.com/ibrd6XMf020bsQ.png) and a list of all your drinks.

There is a [more detailed overview](http://i6.minus.com/ibrFpfxGBx7pPE.png) of the collection, from here you can also access [bottle stats](http://i6.minus.com/i3rul1HVCGTLA.png). these show who consumed from the bottle.

Finally I'll show the [events panel](http://i5.minus.com/irDDtyfhzKzQ5.png). This shows events where we were together and shared some malts. Each event can be accessed to see [what was consumed](http://i3.minus.com/ibxbDLukHLHbed.png), and [who drunk it](http://i2.minus.com/iiX1F10Sfdvl9.png).

I hope you enjoyed this overview of the tracker, I know we certainly enjoy it.

You can [get the tracker here](https://bitbucket.org/bartromgens/malt/), but it has no documentation at the moment and requires some Django experience to easily set up. However my friend would consider writing some documentation if people are interested. New features are still being thought of and frequently added.

1363969330.0	1at0qg	[UPDATE] ScotchPeat.com - Please add your thoughts/wishes	displacedheart	84	20	87	"Hello all,

(I would appreciate if you could be so kind as to upvote so the community knows the final results, but obviously that is your own decision)

As some of you may have known - There was a bit of a debacle yesterday. You can read about it and make your own judgement here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1aqfq8/hello_community_please_read_here_and_respond/

I wanted to clear a few things up: 

1. My apologies to those of you who feel wronged by taking your reviews and putting them into a separate site.

2. The site http://www.scotchpeat.com has had it's database caches cleared. 

3. There were some harsh things said, several inappropriate remarks, and a lot of bad blood yesterday towards me, BUT ALSO towards /u/texacer and some of the mods. Neither the things said to me nor to the mods in poor taste were necessary. Many of you were more constructive though. 

4. There were many people who were upset, BUT there were also many people who liked the idea or liked what it could become. I have dropped the database because there were enough who seemed genuinely offended and the mods did not support it. I can't very well build a site to contribute to a community that is up in arms about it. 

5. I hold no ill will towards the community and will continue to contribute and subscribe. So should you. In retrospect a lot of this could have been prevented if the right people and the community were consulted first.

6. What now? Well I kind of like building cool shit for the web. And I think there could be a lot of cool things that could be done with this. PLUS there were a ton of /r/scotch subscribers that offered to help on the front end (because you might have noticed making things look pretty is not my forte). So here is what I am proposing and requesting from the mods and from the community -

* I would like to keep the architecture of the site up. I think it could still be a good tool with other methods
* I would like to request from /u/texacer and the mods to use the archive they built, but in a different manner. I would like to list the review LINKS. I will not scrape your content into the site UNLESS you give me permission. ALL of the reviews will point to the original review which is in Reddit where /u/texacer and some of you wanted the content to remain. You can search the archive for reviews, but it will provide a link to the actual review on scotchit. THIS BENEFITS SCOTCHIT and may even send more users to the scotchit community for good reviews. I'm only linking to your content, unless a user wants their review scraped into the site. At this point the user could sign in, create an account, and request that the site brings their review into the database on scotchpeat.
* I would like give full credit to the scotchit community on the site. 
* I would also like to play with the data. I would like to provide average ratings for each dram, average cost, and be able to build some fun visualisations for you all. A more visual way to see general sentiment towards a dram. We could also provide some cool historical info about the distillery and fun facts.
* Last but not least, I would like to provide you an input to add a new review if you so choose. 
*Also the mods of scotchit will have admin access on scotchpeat if they wish. 

The last item is that I'll need some help from the community. I would ask you to contribute three items to this thread:
1. Are these terms acceptable to you? If not, then what would you like to see changed?
2. Is this feature set something you would like to see? Is there something that shouldn't be on there? Do you have another idea for something cool that could be on this site?
3. Front end dev, Ruby or designer? Lend me a hand?

any kind.  horror story, love story, nice story, sexy story, annoying story, family story.  some story you might have.

examples:

I went to a party for work at a bar I've never been to.  I ordered a nice whisky from the bar but I had`to shout to the bartender because this bar had music blaring so loud you couldnt hear the person next to you speak.  I hate that.  its designed so you drink more and talk less.  So I ordered my whisky and he went to it, grabbed the bottle and a tumbler.  It was all going well until he grabbed an ice scoop and dumped an entire loud into the glass as I was yelling at the top of my lungs NOOOOOOO.  no one heard me, I might as well have whispered it.  ruined whisky, expensive price, too loud of a bar to do anything.  Texacer sad.  

story 2:

recently had a wedding event in the family.  after the wedding there was a 3 hour gap until the reception for some stupid reason.  So the wife and I went to a bar/mexican restuarant.  We ordered drinks at the bar and some guac.  Not a great selection of whisky but I ordered the Buchannans 12 which I've never had before.  ""Buchannans 12, neat.""

""what does neat mean?"" said the adult male 'bartender'.  I said it meant no ice, just in a glass.  So he said okay, went and grabbed a nice sized tumbler.  Poured a shot into it... hmmm... poured another... hmm... dumped a bunch more in the glass.  4 fingers high.  gulp.  thanks.   $6.   Texacer happy.

1358871827.0	172738	I made some Spaghetti	texacer	74	12	49	"Whenever I cook simple things I like to add.  I made some simple Spaghetti for dinner last night, meatballs included.  Usually we buy some Prego sauce as our brand of choice.  I tried something different to add a little more to the sauce.

I use some frozen meatballs that the family likes.  in a pan a little water and the meatballs.  once they brown up on all sides remove them but dont clean the pan. 

In the same pan, some unsalted butter. enough to cover your sauce pan.  Melted and starting to bubble.  I pre-cut my fresh garlic.  The thinner you cut your garlic the more flavor there is.  ([having problems pealing, this works](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d3oc24fD-c)).  

White onion chopped up and minced.  add galic and onion to bubbling butter.  sautee.  when they start to brown up slightly with the butter  **add some Islay**.  I used Black Bottle.  The smokey spirit caramelizes with the onions and butter.  

after a little cooking time and the onion is getting a bit clearer and browning, add your pasta sauce and mix with a wooden spoon.  meatballs back in the sauce.  (optional:  some white parmesian sauce for a more creamy sauce)

after your noodles are cooked a bit al dente, drain, back in pot,  add sauce and meatball mix right in the pot.  cook  a bit more so the sauce melds together with the noodles and finishes cooking them.  at this point you can add a little more Islay so the smokiness comes out a bit more (if you like).

I don't usually drink whisky with my meal but after sometimes as a dessert.  I had some Laphroaig. (don't cook with the expensive malts)

good stuff, hope youre hungry now.

It is leaps and bounds better than the diageo that has been posted a million times here.  However, the malts he populated it with are in very subjective spots.  For me, I haven't had a bunch on there and I couldnt verify how correct the placement of those are and also some I thought were in the wrong places to begin with while others are spot on for my tastes as well.

It is also very indepth which makes it look cluttered, despite how well organized it is.  Plus he spelled Laphroaig wrong, which makes me hate him... okay not really hate.  He did a great job making this,  but it needs a little help.

---

So what do?

[I made a very simplified map](http://i.imgur.com/YTn8I.png).  It is blank.

I have also compiled a [list of malts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e1UhAMRP7OlICa65N_glPSTaOGF47ionw8vXyTilG9A/edit), scotch only.

What I want to do this week, is lock down the list, add/subtract what the community thinks it should be. 

 Then I'll number the list.  

Then release the map again, with the numbered list attached as a key.

Then it will be up to you guys to participate.  Take the malts you have personally had and put their **number** in the regions you think are correct.  this can be as simple as using PAINT.  import the map into PAINT and use the text tool.  or there is this nifty online **[""photoshop"" program](http://pixlr.com/editor/)** that I found that works great.  doesnt have be pretty, the final compiled one will be pretty

if enough people contribute we'll be able to make a unified Scotchit Malt Map that will be subjective, but mostly accurate as a community.

How does that sound?  I think if we get enough participation, it will be awesome and we never have to see that other flavor map again.  So start thinking about where you would place the Scotches that you've had. look for the KEYED map tomorrow probably.

cheers.

**edit update:  I think it's safe to say we have a list ready to go.  look for the new post tomorrow.**

[here is it](http://goo.gl/maps/K5G5)

now, you have to have a gmail account to enter your location (only your location) but if you don't just post your location in here and maybe we can all pitch in and help enter our subscribers locations.

here's how it works:

1. log into google
2. goto the link
3. click on the red EDIT button
4. on the map you should see a blue push pin, click on it and you can place it anywhere you want to in the world 
5. enter your reddit username in the location you choose.
6. when entered, click save on the left menu.  done.

this of course isn't mandatory but it could be pretty cool to see how we stretch across the globe.  

if you're worried about someone having your address, just put the pin somewhere near where you live and not the exact location.

I can't wait to see the results of this. any questions, just ask.

Hi Scotchiteers, MSheinberg here with another update on the private label order. 

**We are up to 30 confirmed orders** of the Aberlour 2000 scotch, and there are lots of people who have PM'ed me about their interest but have not placed an order yet.

For those of you who need a refresher, here's what we're talking about: A cask of Aberlour distilled in 2000 and bottled earlier this year (12 yrs). The label will indicate that it was bottled especially for [1] /r/scotch and possibly have the reddit alien on it. The price would be $70 plus tax and shipping.

I am a retailer in New York City, having done this personally for nigh on 10 years and my current place of employment has been in operation since the 1940s.

Thus far I've had 16 bottles ordered, out of the 60 that I need to make this happen. To order a bottle, we would need to have a phone conversation (pm me for the phone number).

[There are certain states I cannot ship to.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/uj1mf/scotchit_bottlings/c4w1nx2) If you have any questions, please feel free to PM me or leave a comment. I hope we can make this happen but I need firm commitments from everyone before I can put the order in (otherwise I'm going to be stuck with 30 bottles of reddit scotch that I won't be able to sell to anyone!)

**All orders need to be in by this Sunday! If I don't have the 60 bottle minimum, then it won't happen!**"	t5_2qq65	True

Top shelf are mostly highlands and speysides and the Sazerac Rye due to bottle heights.  Next two shelves are mostly Islay + some minis,  bottom shelf is a mishmash of other scotch, bourbon, Japanese.   

I really tried to organize completely by region/distillery, but the bottle heights/shelf heights didn't quite match up, plus I don't feel comfortable stacking too much on one shelf.  

It even has a light so I can light up the amber waves of barley!

Love it!

For those of you unfamiliar with Ralfy he has become a bit of a celebrity in the whisky reviewing world on youtube.  check out his reviews, they are fun and very addicting.  He also does some tours of distillieries.  Beware:  the first time I found him I watched his first review and then it was 6 in the morning before I realized I watched a hundred reviews.  He is quite the character and very informative.

[here is his youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/ralfystuff)

Its been nearly a year since we last talked to him and we've gained more than 6,000 new members since then. So I figured we should check back in and give all our new members a chance to ask him anything they want.  He responded quickly and is ready to go.

---

**Important:**  This is just the announcement.  **DO NOT POST YOUR QUESTIONS HERE.**  a post will be made tomorrow.  I just wanted to let you people know ahead of time so you can think up something good to ask.  And also to give people who aren't aware of him time to watch some of his stuff from youtube.  Don't worry about asking something that was asked last time either.  Remember the only drawback of this kind of AMA is you cannot do follow up questions, so please think out your questions thoroughly.

---

as was the case with the Laphroaig AMA, I will email all your questions to him because that works pretty well and is the way he'd like to do it anyways.  *I'll remove this post when I post the AMA tomorrow.*

CHEERS!

I've been enjoying the posts here for the last few months and thought I'd share how I'm using the reviews on here to motivate me to regularly exercise. 

I find a scotch that is highly reviewed, like the Ardbeg Uigeadail and cover it with 12 sticky notes. I set a date, usually the end of the month, and then every time I exercise I get to take a sticky off. If I complete all 12 exercise sessions I get to buy the scotch! If I don't complete before the date, I have to start again.

I've used this to allow myself to buy an Oban 14, and I just finished uncovering the Oogie [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/MblxOpw), and now am working on the double wood Balvenie

1373550145.0	1i2upy	Presenting: The Review Score Normalizer	Dworgi	65	6	50	"So, one of those things that's bothered me about Scotchit is how compressed the scale for review scores seems. I'd been grumbling about it in a few threads and a few comments until I remembered that I was, in fact, a programmer, so I could do something about it. So I did. 

I present to you: [The Review Score Normalizer](http://imgur.com/a/EseUu)!

**What's it do?** 

In a nutshell, it places a set of review scores along a [normal distribution](http://i.imgur.com/yglSXzW.jpg) and clamps the best and the worst reviews as 0 and 100 (you can set those to whatever you want). The rest are placed equidistantly along the curve between -2.65 and 2.65 standard deviations away from the mean. 

The scores don't actually matter at the moment, only the ordering does. I think that's going to be the biggest sticking point for some...

It's written in C# (it's the language I'm most familiar with) and it's pretty barebones as I threw it together in about 3 hours. If anyone wants to play around with it, I'd be happy to share the executable and the source. I didn't put any viruses into it, but you don't have to take my word for it.

I even made it work with the Scotchit review archive out of the box! That's the little ""Scotchit?"" check box. 

Overall, I'm pretty happy with it, and I think I'm going to move towards exclusively using it in my own reviews.

***Interesting Statistics!***

* The raw mean of reviews on Scotchit is **83.4**  
* The mean of reviews of whiskies with more than 5 reviews is **85**  
* The lowest-rated Scotch (with more than 5 reviews) is **Johnnie Walker Red Label** with a score **50.4**, followed by **Dewar's White Label**
* The highest-rated Scotch (with more than 5 reviews) is **Ardbeg Uigeadail**, followed by **Lagavulin 12**

**What's next?** 

Well, I don't know. I could try to respect the scores assigned, and not just place every result in basically an ordered list before scoring them. Ie. if one score is 80.1 and the next is 80.2, then they'll be much closer than consecutive reviews of 60 and 75. However, I'm really not sure - it seems like that would skew the distribution quite a bit. I'm open to suggestions, though, so let me know if you have any ideas.

So, Scotchit, here's my question: Are you happy with the current review scoring system, where everything gets clumped around 80, or would you rather use the whole scale of 0-100?

1.  Every post gets cleared by the mods [in accordance with our rules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14FIs5UOo_n-djPrLwo0SvrOSdTaxP3UNLeaovO-RCVs/edit?pli=1) and then given a **COLOR CODED** flair designation.  Each thumbnail you see has a hover-over color and name:  Discussion, Review, First Review, Misc Whisk, and Mod Post.  Use this while looking down our page to find the things you want to read.  Its there for you.

2. Read our rules, they are posted in the sidebar.  Also if you want all our links from the sidebar and some other special ones, check out the [Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ibxWwtYEc6ZTTDtDrSBm25a3qvqJXeGrInl9wClTup4/edit) at the top of the page under the Quick Links sections.  The guide was made for 3 reasons:  1-clean the sidebar 2- allow people who surf using phones to be able to see the stuff in the sidebar.  3- for seasoned members to point to for our new members.  theres lots of great stuff in there. 

3. The community review always has an ad in the sidebar.  Or you can see a new bottle next to Ron Swanson at the top every month with hover-text.  

4. if you want to make the [whisky review archive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsnkEzAVwhUVdF91M3R1NFdvQWYwY1JEeHNpNnZCbVE&amp;hl=en_US#gid=0) work for you better: use [LIST MODE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/lv?key=0AsnkEzAVwhUVdF91M3R1NFdvQWYwY1JEeHNpNnZCbVE&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rm=full#gid=0).  To find list mode, its at the top of the archive under ""VIEW""- list.  List mode is very helpful for sorting reviews by name/reviewer/date/region/price/rating.  


---

I hope this helps people.  Sometimes us seasoned members take all this for granted and I wanted to share what some of you might have missed by not either knowing these things exist, or you front page lurkers who don't actually come to the subreddit, you wont see these things on the reddit main front page. 

cheers

There are a couple of scotches she really likes:

* Balvenie Doublewood 12-year (Easy $35-40 bottle)

* Highland Park Thor (Er, I like to pay rent...)

She thinks that Ardmore's peated non-chill filtered is OK, and said that Glenlivet's 15 year French Oak Reserve was ""a good whisky"". I tend to agree with her on those assessments, and will be reviewing those two in the future.

Finding something she'll like is a bit of a challenge, but I'm willing to go on said journey with her, and might find something new that I like, too.

Laphroaig is right out. She finds it far too peaty and doesn't care for the iodine. From what I've read, that will also impact her trying things like Lagavulin, wouldn't it? 

I posted a thread asking about things similar to Thor a couple of days ago, but I thought that the rather amusing quote of “I want to crawl into a smoking oak cask with a bag of nuts and some vanilla beans” might help narrow down a list of suggestions for us to head to a bar with a good scotch selection.


So, what are your thoughts, malt samplers of /r/scotch? 

**EDIT:** Thanks for all of the suggestions! This is quite the list to work our way through, but I *suppose* I could help her with the ones she doesn't care for. :)"	t5_2qq65	True

My father and I have been big beer guys and like to experiment with crafts, but lately have talking a lot about scotch. We exchange info and samples, and so far I've acquired a couple bottles as gifts: A Dimple Pinch, a Chivas 12, and the Balvenie sample pack trio(so far only cracked the 12 doublewood). Been experimenting with rocks, water, neat, testing how different each experience is. Slightly challenging at first, but I've been finding it easier and am becoming excited trying new things.

Went home for the weekend for Dad's birthday, and he had a Glenlivet Nadurra sitting out on the bar. Poured myself a nip and tried to sound like I knew what I was talking about and tasting. Not bad. 

I gave him his gift: Highland Park 12. Although he's more traveled on scotch, we're both relatively newbies. So based on lurking and reading sidebar info, I decided this was a good pick for both of us to get our feet just little bit more wet. Took a sniff and was pleasantly surprised. I half expected to be overwhelmed by either alcohol or smoke, but we described it as a nice polite punch to the nose. I was a little scared to take my first sip, but wow! I was surprised I was tasting something completely different! I don't want to embarrass myself by pretending I could pinpoint notes I sensed, but if I was ever unsure about going down this path of scotch, I'm definitely not unsure anymore. I'm in. 

Just wanted to share a beginner's experience.

The scotchit bottling craze is underway! As of today, I have 12 bottles already committed to being purchased. As a reminder, I need to have 60 bottles committed before I can make the purchase order.

I've had several people tell me either in one of the threads or over PM that they were interested, but haven't provided the required information to reserve a bottle. As a reminder, this is what I need:

* Name

* Address

* Phone number

* Credit Card Number

**Until you provide me with this information, you have not reserved yourself a bottle, and have not added yourself into the bottle count I have going above!!!!!**

I know that many people are nervous about giving such information over the internet, and would never ask anyone to do that. I work in a brick-and-mortar store (the store itself has been in business since the 1940's and my boss has owned it since the 80's). We are legit.

**If you are interested in a bottle or two, please PM me and we'll get the ball rolling!**

Also, if you know of people in other subreddits, let them know about this. I want to keep it primarily /r/scotch people, but if we can't get the minimum, then I'd rather get non-scotchit people in here to buy rather than drop the project.

In case you missed the earlier threads, this is what we are doing:

Getting a bottle of Aberlour 2000 (12 yr old) that is independently bottled by The Classic Cask and it will have some version of /r/scotch's name on the label and hopefully the alien as well (image pending). 

The price is $70, not including tax or shipping. We do have a standard quote for shipping but I'm trying to save you guys money where I can, and will give each individual their own shipping price. 

Also, if you are interested in ordering more bottles from me, I do have a Google doc with our current stock and also items that I may be able to special order for you (note: The special order side of the doc is never guaranteed. Supplier stocks fluctuate, and I may not be able to meet their delivery minimum with just your order, etc.). If you want access to this doc, PM me your email address and I'll send it over ASAP.

**tl;dr** We are still taking Scotchit bottle orders, PM me for details!"	t5_2qq65	True

don't vote again if you already have, this is the same poll.  230 of you have already voted which is awesome.  I'll have the results in a couple days and we'll do another.    remember this is just for overall brand, not individual whisky.

*here's some fun low-lights so far:*  

-someone likes to drink ""Anus""

-another one of you enjoys drinking ""pussy""

-and some of you sickos like Jack Daniels, Jim Beam, J&amp;B and ""EVAN WILLIAMS LOLZ"".

-those that like Bruichladdich and Glenfiddich can also spell them correctly, however...

If you like Laphroaig so much, WHY can't you spell it? --  ""Laphraiog"", ""Laphroiag"", ""Laphroig"", ""Laphroaigh"" and my favorite: ""lophroaig""

---

good work so far guys, hope we reach more today.  the second poll is going to be what are your 2nd and 3rd favorite brands after your first.  can't be the same whisky. so think about it now and look for the next poll soon

cheers

1367865125.0	1dt28d	Will I ever taste the individual flavors? Question from a Scotch newbie.	imnotmarvin	58	9	33	"I bought my first bottle of Scotch this weekend, Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban. I've been a Jack Daniels drinker for a while. Mostly the obligatory Jack and Coke and the occasional shot. I tried drinking a few glasses straight and found it not exactly to my liking. A friend suggested I mature my tastes a little and try a Scotch. After a little poking around online I settled on the above. I poured a glass neat last night in a tapered tumbler. Gave it a sniff and liked the scent but didn't really pick out anything beyond a little bit of floral maybe. I gave it a sip and WOW, felt like velvet on my tongue. That part of it was definitely different from the Jack Daniels. The flavor and aftertaste were far different too but I didn't get all of these individual flavors people describe. Did I drink to fast? Should you let Scotch linger in your mouth before swallowing? Do I need a drop of water to ""open it up""? I've seen all of the eloquent reviews and I know all of the reviewers aren't full of crap, they're picking up on these flavors but my untrained palate would describe the experience as moving from Jack, a burnout on my tongue performed by a 68 Nova with an oil leak, to a nice bottle of Scotch being more of the soft idle of a Ferrari all through your mouth. If it never goes farther than that, I suppose I still like the Scotch better than the Jack Daniels but is there a maturing process in your palate?

EDIT - Thanks to all of you for taking the time to reply. All of the advice is not only appreciated, it proved to be worthwhile last night. I did a two glass experiment that was suggested below and had my first Scotch revelation. I believe I'll be around this sub for a long time. Talk to all you soon.

He's got a bottle in his hand, which turns out to be Lagavulin 16...and which is quite unusual for a liquor store (usually bottles go the other direction). He plops the bottle down on the counter and says ""now...before I go on, I just want you to know that you're probably not allowed to give refunds (blah blah blah) but I think THIS might be a special situation."" ..... My friend: ""go on..."" Him: ""something is WRONG with this bottle. Go on...give it a whiff...it smells like POISON!!"" Friend gave it a whiff...smelled like the peaty smokey wonderfulness that it is. Tried his best to tell him that this is very good scotch, but might take some getting used to. Guy got embarrassed that he was wrong about it and stormed out without his bottle, saying to ""pour it down the drain"" on his way out. Next customer in line got a free bottle of Lag 16.

you may have noticed the little color Tartan flair next to some users names now.

this is our newest ranking system for reviewers. 

---

At the first review, you get your text flair (please keep these simple).  then after 10 reviews, you'll receive your first level of Tartan Flair.  so far there are [10 levels](http://d.thumbs.redditmedia.com/JpPHEaW2zHtEYTlQ.png) and you will level up every 10 reviews you do.

in order to level up, the review MUST be archived.  bourbon reviews do not count, as they are for /r/bourbon, but every other whisky reviewed here does. Including the community review.  I have 97 reddit reviews but 7 of those are bourbon.  My Tartan level is 9 with archived and community reviews.  

---

What I need from you guys.  Your current review score.  Make sure you've archived all your reviews and add to them your community review.  Below here, give me your number of reviews and I'll adjust your Tartan Flair accordingly.  

If you're not sure if you've missed archiving, look at the spreadsheet, click view and list.  Change the SCOTCHIT REVIEW USERNAME tab to your name only at the top.  This is your list of your reviews.  You can then cross reference with the search function.  in Search, Type your NAME and the word REVIEW.  this is why I say you really should always have the word REVIEW in your title, so they don't get lost. or you can hunt in your submission history.


---
In the future, it'll be your job to keep your review # so the mods can change your tartan level.  11k users, we can't keep the score accurate every day with so many.  We will try, but please help us.

any questions?

cheers,

I want to share something with you, that might seem obvious, but when I got into Scotch, it wasn't obvious to me. It's the right storage position for bottles. Wine bottles are stored lying on the side and some whiskies come with a [fancy box](http://imgur.com/HzBI1), which suggests, that you can lay them down, too.

You shouldn't! As stated in the [FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TsT8Sin4dMJdKAJSyCAtTVQc3uRjddl_Q1PmhfjrzjQ/edit) in the sidebar the cork dissolves in alcohol. (The ABV of wine is lower, than the ABV of whisky or other spirits, so the cork of wine bottles stays intact.) My parents just learned this [the hard way](http://imgur.com/a/49JVO), today. All of these tiny particles, that look like dust on the bottle or seem like a blurry image, are actually little pieces of cork floating in the bottle. This bottle was stored on the side for 5 years and looks like a snow globe now.

Don't let that happen to you: Store your whisky upright only!"	t5_2qq65	True

1359501409.0	17ixs1	Why do you drink scotch vs ___ spirit?	dlareg	50	4	108	"Relative newbie here.  Decided to start buying some whiskies on a whim a few months back because it just seemed kind of a cool thing to get into with my brother.  Started off with real lower tier stuff (Red Label, Chivas) because I figured it'd be cheaper and I didn't want to waste good stuff on our palates before they've matured.  Been slowly making my way through the stuff available at Costco (Glenlivet 12, Macallan Director's Edition, Laphroaig 10) but along the way took a few pit stops buying bottles to sample some other spirits- Four Roses, Woodford Reserve, Jack, Remy Martin VSOP, Maker's Mark, Jameson, maybe a couple of others.

I have to say I'm really gravitating towards Scotch.  In particular, the Laphraoig 10 we tried this weekend I found really eye-opening in a great way (although the first glass I found quite strange).  I've been spending an excess of time lurking this subreddit lately and already in my head I've got the next few purchases planned (Glenlivet 15 bought today, next up Highland Park 12, Lagavulin 16).

Getting back to my original question- Why do you afficionados enjoy Scotch as opposed to higher end cognacs, tequilas, etc?  Do those drinks not offer the same depth or complexities in flavor as scotch for some reason?

I'm just wondering if I'm being drawn to Scotch because I'm enamored by all of the pseudo-sophistcated stuff I read on here, or if I just didn't give those other sprits a fair shake.  I like to drink to taste and relax and not to get drunk, which is why I don't understand the appeal of high-end Vodka.  Maybe that other stuff seemed more one-dimensional to me because I just wasn't used to stronger drinks yet or because the stuff I bought was so cheap?

Sorry if this is posted in the wrong place.. Haven't seen a recent beginner's question thread."	t5_2qq65	True
