My girlfriend was basically kicked out of her house last year, and she moved in with me. Despite her parents being crazy (theyre Spanish and Pentecostal... A terrible combination. They would constantly ridicule her for things ""unholy"" like viewing Disney movies. Don't ask me how that is so wrong, I don't get it either) somehow my girlfriend has been able to manage. She graduated high school with a full ride scholarship during the whole moving-out period, and has received a couple of other scholarships here and there.

I have booked us dinner reservations at Cinderella's castle because I know how disappointed he was the first time we went to Disney and couldn't get in there. 

 I spoke with a rep from there earlier who worked out all the special arrangements for the meal.  When I first mentioned that we were a same sex couple the rep got quiet then tells me, ""I have always wanted to play a part in a gay wedding"".  I don't know why she was so tickled at the idea, but hey, if it gets me perks so be it.

I'm trying to calm myself down to fall back asleep after [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/17aice/2am_rescue_operation_success/) by putsing around facebook. I was looking at old photos of my SO and I and I can't stop staring at [these ones](http://imgur.com/a/DfYmv#0) of us at the Stockholm Pride parade last summer. I am just totally dumbstruck by the fact that those two smiling faces belong to guys who have a BABY on the way and I'm one of them! Oh My God!!! I know I'm supposed to be calming down, but I'm absurdly excited! I can't get over the fact that that gorgeous man is my partner and that we mated and shall have offspring. It feels so surreal."	t5_2t7zf	True

I want to be able to give her a Valentine's day that she will remember and show her how much she truly means to me. Unfortunately, I can not afford to do much for her this Valentine's day.

Luckily, I found this contest that could help me so much! It's called Save Dade's 2nd Annual Valentine's Contest. I know I can count on you Reddit! I would really appreciate this.

All you have to do is like [Save Dade's Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/SAVEDade) and like [our picture (Mane and Jessica)](http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=351501364869189&amp;set=a.349853101700682.88872.144774322208562&amp;type=3&amp;theater) on their Valentine's day folder. You have to do both or it will not count. PLEASE help me bring a smile to the face of a girl who put one on mine when I never thought I would again.

TL;DR Help me win a contest for my beautiful girlfriend! Like [this](http://www.facebook.com/SAVEDade) and [this](http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=351501364869189&amp;set=a.349853101700682.88872.144774322208562&amp;type=3&amp;theater). Thank you!!"	t5_2t7zf	True
