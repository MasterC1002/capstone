HittingSmoke	74	15	4	"I moved into a new house recently and there was an OXO tea kettle left over from the previous owners. It seemed like a sturdy kettle but the handle on the lid was broken off.

With zero questions asked the support rep put in a warranty replacement and is shipping me a new lid completely free.

1369251883.0	1eurrv	I'd like to introduce you to /r/WhatToLookForInA, my new subreddit where people can request a buyers' guide for their next purchase	fabriziobianchi	76	17	1	"Hey /r/GoodValue!

Last week I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/findareddit/comments/1eik0y/i_had_this_idea_for_a_whattolookforina_subreddit/) post on /r/BuyItForLife and my idea about a subreddit where the users can exchange information about what is important to look for in a purchase motivated me to open /r/WhatToLookForInA . Here is part to the Mission Statement and Rules post, hoping it will get you guys interested and convince you to subscribe:

Welcome To What To Look For In A!

Instead of regurgitating principles of conduct, I'll explain how did I get the idea for this.

I am Italian, and I live in Northern Europe. When people ask me for what is a good pasta or a good pesto sauce, it is obviously impossible for me to suggest directly a product, knowing that in most cases the same thing I love home won't be available to them.

Same thing happens to me when I look at products suggested on Reddit and discover that in many cases those brands are available only in the US and Canada.

So I started instead to give and ask for tips in how to recognize a good product for a specific purpose and, especially when giving such tips, I understood that my karma went up indefinitely higher because the other person is now a micro-maven in that particular little topic. And as a receiver, I discovered that in Europe we have most of the products that people suggest on Reddit, just under another brand name or with little differences that don't matter.

WhatToLookForInA is a place where to learn how to buy things so to get you time and your money's worth.

Other two contributions you could make to the subreddit are:

- to spontaneously create a guide to purchasing a product you are an expert of. Add [Guide] at the beginning of the title of such a post.

- Propose yourself as a mentor for a specific kind of purchase. In this case you can also freely vaguely specify your location, so to give the possibility to create local shopping groups. Add [Mentor] at the beginning of the title of such a post."	t5_2ue68	True

I am considering buying a memory foam mattress. I see the price range is massive. I can't afford one to spend a thousand on one, but obviously this $250 (Overstock.com) one isn't worth buying. So what should I look for? Ideally, I'd like to spend about $500 - $700. Is that realistic for a decent one or should I spend a little more?

P.S. Also, this is my first time visiting the money subreddits. If this is the wrong place, please let me know.

Edit: Just came across [this] (http://www.sears.com/3inch-gel-matress-topper/p-SPM6715013907?prdNo=4&amp;blockNo=4&amp;blockType=G4&amp;PDP_REDIRECT=false&amp;s_tnt=39869:4:0) Is something like that worth buying?

Edit 2: Thanks for all the advice so far, I am starting to get a good idea of price range. 

I want to add that I am borrowing a 3"" memeory foam topper at the moment, it is pretty good, but I imagine a mattress is way better.

Recently my insulated water bottle threw it's lid behind the oven to spite me and after several ill fated rescue attempts I resigned myself holding a funeral ceremony and moving on.  After the wake I decided that life was too short to just throw the bottle out so I started searching online to buy a replacement but could find nothing, even on the shady tor black market websites.

Distraught, surrounded by empty scotch bottles and staring intently at my grand pappy's revolver it occurs to me that if I plead to the creators of the bottle they may take pity on me and bless me with another lid.  As I pick myself up and go to find their customer support email I find they already have a lid replacement form!  And it's gonna be free!

So I place the order and receive the confirmation email which mentioned that they would have it shipped in 5 days.  Today, 5 days later, I have received not one but two replacement lids and a couple stickers to accompany them!

This is the first company since logitech to just flat out surprise me with much better than expected customer service for a product that I was prepared to receive none for so please excuse me for gushing.

I'm looking for a scanner to scan notes made during lectures. The notes are made on notebookpaper so it has to be possible to scan the document without the writing on the other page shining through (I know this can be avoided when placing a paper behind the notebook sheet)
 
 

I'm not sure if I should buy an all-in-one printer and scanner or a separate scanner and printer. (I'm not printing often so i'm not sure if the problem with inkjet-printers wasting ink will be a problem)


The scanned documents will be sent to evernote.

I'm not sure if I would need an automatic feeder since I assume I have to place a paper behind the note-sheet's so the text on the other side wont shine through.

If it is possible to scan in colors it would be good, but it is not necessary.

It's a roll up garment bag that I originally bought to hold a suit on overnight business travel, but am now starting to use for all my travel needs.  The interior has 3 compartments separated by zippers which allows me to keep my shirts, pants, a sportcoat, casual stuff, all separated and neatly organized.  Living out of it is a snap as all I have to do is unzip the compartments and roll the sections away until I get to the section I'm looking for, then roll every thing back in place and I'm ready to go! The whole thing rolls up into nicely portable roll and I find that I can carry almost a weeks worth of casual clothes or at least 2 suits with minimal wrinkling at my destination.  

It has additional snap-on bags for toiletries and shoes, but I find that I usually carry another overnight type bag for these items as well as computer stuff, etc. Together, this bag, plus a small overnight bag has greatly improved the way I travel.

[Priceblink](http://www.priceblink.com/webcpns/browser-add-on/) is a browser add-on that will automatically search for the best price on items you shop for. So, for example, if you land on a product page on amazon, a bar will appear at the top, which tells you how much the same product costs at different stores around the internet (including ebay), with links. It also will give you coupon codes, reviews, and a graph of the price history. (I just noticed that they have a wish list option that I don't use.) When you're not shopping, the bar disappears.

1350074241.0	11dtem	Need a nice desk/office chair - something around $200 that will last for more than a year.	rob79	15	3	16	"I have an ongoing battle with chairs.  Basically, I keep buying ones that cost around $100, and after a year something goes wrong.  Either the ""piston"" thing underneath will start to slowly leak and after an hour of sitting at my desk I'll be practically on the floor, the castors will break, the back will get loose, etc.  For the record, no, I don't weight 300lbs or anything like that.  I'm a little taller than average, and a bit ""big"" in general, but nothing crazy.  I do tend to move around a lot when I'm sitting, so maybe that's part of the problem.

Anyway, I work from home so I'm talking about something for my home office.  Something that I can sit in (comfortably) for a full work day (with breaks and stuff obviously, but you know what I mean).

Normally I just walk into Staples and pick out a chair that feels ""comfy"", but there is this gap in the chair market where you either get a decent chair for $100, or if you want a *nice* chair it costs $500+.  If I could afford it, I would gladly drop $1000 on a fancy-pants desk chair at this point just to avoid these issues.

It doesn't matter what material it made of (leather preferred, but not required), but I want the height/back to be adjustable, and a bonus would be if the arms would move up and down.  I don't care if I can ""lean back"" in it, but that would be a bonus.

Any suggestions?  Thanks!

Currently we are not paying for cable &amp; just watch everything online on a laptop so pretty much any tv is better.  Seems like there are way more brands than I have ever heard of but I don't want to just buy something because I've heard of the brand.

Basically, I am a dumbass please help me. I obviously have no idea what I am doing. Any input on best places to find a good deal (online or in store)? What exactly am I looking for as a sign of good quality? Just looking for the best I can do at a reasonable price that will last a while. "	t5_2ue68	True

* $100-ish or less price point.
* 5-6 hours battery life. Would mainly be used for music on a porch, or around the house
* iPod dock not needed, would be using Bluetooth or Aux-In (Laptop or Android phone)
* I'm not super Bass crazy, but I have noticed smaller speakers don't always carry bass when played outside. Since I will be using this outside relatively frequently, performance in open air is important to me.

This prevents tangling really well, letting one pack them into a pocket and pull them out later without facing some knot-undoing puzzle. Recently i left them in a shirt pocket and they went through the wash and then the dryer on extra high heat and came out working like new. I think that's pretty special.

6.5 inches open, fits perfectly into your jean's pocket knife pocket. Comes with a clip. I paid around $29 for mine so shop around. I have put it through the paces through a large variety of use, the blade has never bent in the slightest and the overall construction is as rock solid as the day I got it. I have had mine for about 3 years. Holds an edge extremely well. No signs of rust or any corrosion really, although mine had a black finish on the blade that is finally starting to peel to reveal the steel underneath. 

No idea if it is BIFL quality because I have not had it that long yet, but I was tired of spending $15-25 on pocket knives and the blades bent or snapped or the mechanism loosened up with minimal use. Originally I was a bit hesitant at dropping $30 for such a small knife, but three years later I contend it was one of the best purchases I have made. "	t5_2ue68	True

The context is that I'd like something I can stick onto my bike to play tunes for my friends and I while we go on group night rides. As such, it has to be fairly small, but fairly loud. I will also be using it regularly around the house, so hopefully it's not just super loud without quality sound. I would like something that holds up in both situations ideally. 

Being a design geek, of course I've had my eye on the Jambox by Jawbone because they are beautiful. But they're crazy expensive and I've heard they don't get that loud. Loudness is a key factor, but hopefully not at the complete expense of decent sound. I love me some bass.

On the cheaper end of the spectrum is the iClarity, which is around $50, very small, and is said to get louder than the Jambox, but sacrifices some of the sound quality. 

I guess I'm just looking to see if anyone has owned a product that fits the bill or has suggestions.

1371083252.0	1g8gnn	GV request: Ceiling Fan	YodaMush	4	1	4	"Hey guys, I tried doing a quick search here and at BIFL for ceiling fans and didn't come up with any other threads. So! I need a ceiling fan, preferably with three speeds. Lights aren't necessary, have plenty of that already. I'm interested in your stories, opinions and experiences in general.

As far as my experience goes, I haven't had a bad fan but I'm timid on just picking one up from Home Depot assuming I'm getting a quality product. Price range is anything less than $300, won't break down after years of use (constant use, I don't ever turn them off of medium/low), and can potentially move a ton of air. I'm going to end up getting two, one for a small-medium room and one for a medium-large room. Thanks guys!"	t5_2ue68	True
1364495826.0	1b6xcf	shop-vac question	hellzn0	6	1	9	"I'm in desperate need of a good vacuum that I can also use for my car. I've always heard good things about shop-vacs, and I'm thinking [this little guy](http://www.amazon.com/Shop-Vac-5870400-4-Gallon-4-5-PeakHorsepower-Around/dp/B0008JIQVI/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top) might be the ticket. 

Anyone using a shopvac as their only vacuum on carpeting/linoleum/autos? 

It makes sense to me that it should work just fine for say, a living room and two small-ish bedrooms if people like them for their cars, but I can't really get a good read from product reviews on whether or not it's going to be a MAJOR hassle or something to use on carpeting. 

Thoughts and advice appreciated. Thanks!


Edit: this got downvoted, I'm guessing because maybe it better belongs in a different sub? Feel free to point me in the right direction if I should be somewhere else asking this question. Also, there's very little info in the sidebar, so maybe beefing that up a bit could help people get a better sense of what belongs here and what doesn't."	t5_2ue68	True

1361904408.0	199uct	Some really amazing (and relatively inexpensive) shoes!	jamstight	15	11	17	If you aren't concerned about looking stylish and are merely looking for a shoe that gets the job done the [Keen Howser](http://www.cabelas.com/catalog/product.jsp?productId=1380994&amp;productVariantId=3203356&amp;WT.tsrc=CSE&amp;WT.mc_id=GoogleProductAds&amp;WT.z_mc_id1=03485173&amp;rid=40&amp;channel=GoogleBaseUSA&amp;mr:trackingCode=A780501B-90E1-E111-BA78-001B21631C34&amp;mr:referralID=NA&amp;mr:adType=pla&amp;mr:ad=19135901711&amp;mr:keyword=&amp;mr:match=&amp;mr:filter=43600703111&amp;gclid=CIGAst_O1LUCFQGunQod3RkA6Q) is for you. Some places market them as slippers, some places as moccasins, but whatever they are they are stupendous. I've had mine for a year and a half now and I love them even more than when I first got them, and they're only around $50 bucks! Not only are they the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned (by a wide margin), they are also pretty much waterproof (marketed as water resistant, but I was standing on ice and broke through and the water didn't even penetrate to my socks, so as long as you aren't actively just standing in water up to your ankles these should get the job done). I love not having to deal with laces, it makes life so much easier, and on top of all this they are astonishingly warm. Plus, they seem really durable (at least thus far) as I have worn them almost everyday since I got them and the only tear or fraying I have is from when I was jumping over a barbed wire fence and my foot got caught on it. They also provide really good support and have a really sturdy rubber outsole which provides great gripping. So if you're looking for a casual shoe to wear around the house that you can also have the ability to take your dog to the dog park in or what have you, then I would highly, highly, recommend these bad boys.	t5_2ue68	True

1359740777.0	17pdm6	[GV Review] Signature sleep contour mattress	stupidrobots	4	3	7	"So I am in a temporary apartment and I needed a sleeping arrangement.  I was looking for a full size mattress, not foam, brand new.  Most of the thrift shops had only twin size beds for about $199.  After reading reviews, however, I decided to pick up a Signature Sleep Contour 8 inch thick mattress from Walmart, $179 with free shipping.  It's an independently sprung coil mattress.  It came to my door vacuum packed and stuffed into a sturdy nylon cylinder resembling a duffel bag.  It was hard to believe that a full-size mattress was in there.  After some pushing and shoving, i got it removed and slit the side with a razor.  Air rushed into the bag and PSSSSHHHHHT i had a mattress from the future!

Build quality appears solid, not BIFL like a $1200 serta or anything but definitely good for a few years of daily use from my estimation.  I thrifted a pillowtop cover for extra comfort and this combination makes for one of the best sleeping arrangements I have ever had.  I wake up and I'm not sore, which is great as I am a weightlifter with a history of back pain so a good night's sleep is very important to me.  It's certainly on the softer side overall so if you need a firm mattress it may not be the one for you, but for someone who sleeps on their side or stomach and prefer a softer bed it's great.

Bedframe wise I went with a platform bed, no box spring as it seemed unnecesary.  It was a walmart flat pack that took me a couple hours to get together.  It's cheap but it looks nice for now.

Overall I am extremely impressed with the value of this product and would strongly recommend it for someone looking for a new mattress on a budget.  The reviews are remarkably good too at www.walmart.com"	t5_2ue68	True

1345746196.0	ypi68	[GV request] Laser printer for design student. 	hellohaley	2	1	15	"I posted before in BIFL, couldn't find my old thread and didn't remember finding an answer I was satisfied with enough to buy.

Preferably COLOR laser printer, as we do mostly black and white for mock ups but often do color studies as well, and having a color printer at home will alleviate the issue of finding a 24 hr print shop on those all nighters finishing projects. An all-in-one would be nice, and a scanner is a huge plus (almost mandatory), but printing is obviously the most crucial.

My main concerns are: 

1. Reliability - every printer I or my family has ever had ended up having problem after problem, error messages constantly, and generally being broken more often than working. I need something that will come through for me in my hour of need at 5am the morning before my projects are due, rather than crapping out like they always do.

2. Cost effective - the ink cartridges must have good value. Many people buy the printer and think 'oh boy that was a good price!' to find out later the ink refills cost an arm and a leg. This is a major consideration, being a student who will use a lot of ink. 

3. Customer service/warranty - I've learned over the years that with anything HP, you're gonna have a bad time. We've owned countless HP printers, and they are worth little more than scrap plastic. No one repairs them, no one is there online or on the phone to help you, the online help center never addresses your issue, etc etc etc. I'm looking for a company that not only has the gumption to sell me a printer, but the balls to stick around and offer support during the time that I use it as well. I'm afraid of buying something then being given the cold shoulder by a company or retailer and I'm stuck with yet another broken printer.

4. Connectivity - I have a mac. I would love to have a wireless/bluetooth setup, but I realize I can't have it all. If it is usb connected, I'd hope it's at least reliable and works with my computer (an is not a pc only, or pc with some really shitty mac-version software). I want something I can plug in and print, not something that installs a bunch of bloatware and shortcuts on my computer and hassles me with popups for the rest of my life.

 I'm not against buying used if it's a solid, reliable product and I'm not just buying someone else's junk that will die in a month and i'll be out of luck when no company or retailer will take it back or help me.

I know these are a lot of demands to make on something like a printer, but I have to hope that they are out there somewhere. With all the people with home offices, businesses, and freelance designers, I'd hope someone has found a printer that can do the job!
