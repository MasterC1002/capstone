My friends tried to get me into the new(ish) kids stuff, like Fairly Odd Parents, Spongebob, Phineas and Ferb, and so on but to no avail. Aside from the ""adult"" cartoons (Family Guy, South Park...you get the picture) I never watched anything else cartoon wise. I was flipping through the channels the other day and I happened upon Regular Show. Within seconds I was laughing out loud. It has such dry humor, odd characters, and is anything but regular. That's my type of humor. The writing on this show is hilarious. I love Pops' character, with his high pitched voice and seemingly ditzy/weird attitude, that just cracks me up. It's an odd show. I'm not sure if it's made to be for kids but I love it."	t5_2sfbv	True

Quintel - wanna do us a solid and do an IAmA?	ladysiena	178	9	15	"First of all, I know this should probably be in the subreddit IAmA but I feel like you folks would appreciate it more. Secondly, here are my questions (which are all about regular show, but props for marvelous misadventures!: 

1. I'm cruising up to you in Pop's car - does that mean I can have your number? But seriously...(*seriously*)

2. What cartoons did you like as a child? What cartoons do you like now?

3. Can you confirm my suspicions about why Muscle Man's eyes are red?

4. Do you get ideas for your more surreal episodes from dropping acid/doing shrooms (like how you got the idea for [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y894QNtX0VA))?

5. And, I mean this with the utmost respect (and awe) how did this pass as a children's show? Actually, one of my favorite aspects of this show is that you enjoy it now and you know you would have loved it as a child. 

Thank you so much for doing this, J.G! High-Five.

---

**Friend:** What is this show again?

**Me:** It’s like if Clerks and Adventure Time had a baby.

**Friend:** I’m in!

---

**Friend:** Is that a f**kcing blue jay?

**Me:** Yeah.

**Friend:** Why is he with a raccoon?

**Me:** Why did Bugs Bunny hang out with Daffy Duck?

**Friend:** …

---

**Friend:** What is up with that guy?

**Me:** No one knows. Pops is kinda moody.

**Friend:** I meant why is his head so big?

**Me:** Oh…I don’t know. But don’t ask him about it, or he might cry.

**Friend:**…uhhh….

---

**Friend:** What the hell?! Is that guy sick?

**Me:** No, he’s just an albino gorilla.

**Friend:** What the hell are we watching?

**Me:** Right now, it’s Skips. He’s called that cause he skips everywhere.

**Friend:** Why?

**Me:** The only girl he ever loved skipped everywhere.

**Friend:**…

**Me:** Skips might be the Chosen One. I’m not sure, but he’s saved the universe a few times.

**Friend:** I think I might need large amounts of weed to keep watching this.

**Me:** Skips is voiced by Mark Hamil.

**Friend:** No shit, really?

**Me:** Yeah.

**Friend:** Okay, I’m sold on that character.

---

**Me:** That’s Muscle Man.

**Friend:** Is he a goblin or something?

**Me:** I don’t know. He’s just green.

**Friend:** Okay.

**Me:** You know who *else* is green?

**Friend:** No, who?

**Me:** …oh wait, you won’t get it yet.

**Friend:**…what?

**Me:** Never mind. Just remember that everything about Muscle Man rules.

**Friend:** What’s with the ghost thing.

**Me:** That’s High-Five ghost. He's Muscle Man's best friend.

**Friend:** Did he die giving someone a high-five or something?

**Me:** I don’t know. But he can play the trumpet.

**Friend:** (give me a look like I am insane)

---

**Friend:**…

**Me:** It's okay, take a minute to get used to what you are seeing.

**Friend:**…that is a talk gumball machine.

**Me:** Yeah, that’s the park manager and Mordo and Ribgy’s boss.

**Friend:** But…but…it’s a gumball machine!

**Me:** Yeah, and he’s a jerk.

**Friend:** Probably cause he’s a god damn gumball machine.

**Me:** You know how Looney Tunes how no one asks questions about a talking rabbit? Imagine if they are all people and it’s a lot less weird.

---

**Me:** Oh yeah, I forgot to warn you about something.

**Friend:** Oh god, what now?

**Me:** Every episode, something really weird happens. I don’t mean like what you’ve seen, but like, supernatural or abnormally weird.

-The Hammer materialized via the video-game console-

**Me:** There it is.

---

**Friend:** (insane laughter when Muscle Man gets hit so hard his own boobs smack him in the face)

---
I told him to watch an episode on his own (recommended ""Death Bear"") because the first episode for everyone is a bit hard to interpret. But he's willing to give it a try.

1371074595.0	1g85en	What's wrong with Regular Show being deep every now and then?	wordsandwich	77	10	16	"It seems like there's always a group of fans who complain that the show has gone down hill and that they aren't going to watch it anymore any time there's an episode that touches on deeper themes. They feel that episodes like this stray too far from the slacker humor that defines the show.

I think the frustration is understandable if what you're looking for is some mindless humor, but I think that having story arcs like this is essential to the show's survival and continued success. Otherwise, it just becomes another Aqua Teen Whateveritscallednow--a show that's going on forever while failing to keep itself new. It's weird because Adventure Time gets way more praise for going much deeper than Regular Show.

I think the central element of show has been playing out fairly realistic early 20s situations in a surreal way. It's the same thing as Rocko's Modern Life putting a crazy spin on other real life troubles. The difference is that RS doesn't make the characters as one-dimensional. That said, the show knows its demo and will probably never lose its sense of fun. It's possible to have story arcs and humor.
