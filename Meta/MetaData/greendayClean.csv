1348303487.0	10ahu6	What the fuck?	Ghost2268	133	19	58	How can anyone be mad at Billie for what he did at the show? Shit. Just in a two minute span, I saw like 5 dumb assholes with a bored look on their face waiting for Rihanna. A band that's been around longer than Taylor swift has lived gets the silent treatment. No, fuck that. Fuck everything about that. Then all you fans get mad at him for getting angry over that? I love all you Green Day fans but think for a second. Going up on stage is something that isn't easy. Even if you've done it a lot of times and even if you're drunk. I've gone on stage and its not easy. Now, imagine going up there and seeing people be bored at what you're playing. It sucks. Especially when you're one of the greatest bands of all time. He had a reason to be mad. Then, the fact that he cut off a song. Really, why in the fuck would you continue to play for a bunch of preppy douchebags who love one direction and music entirely made by a Macintosh. I know it was disappointing for people who were real fans at the show but when the majority of people are being dicks, there's no point in going on. If he gives an apology  it has to be to actual fans. I don't want him to apologize for his behavior to those other assholes. And by the way, this shit is nothing compared to what that cocksucker Axl Rose has done so don't even make the comparison. Fuck, downvote me to hell or insult me for the rest of my fucking life but I won't back down on my opinion. Sorry for all the swearing, makes me sound like I'm a twelve year old on YouTube. I'm just a bit mad about the posts and opinions I've been reading. 	t5_2snhx	True

1371254116.0	1gdeky	So, I own one of the rarest pieces of Green Day memorabilia in existence...	CartoonJones	83	9	26	"A quick history lesson:

Before they were Green Day, they were Sweet Children, and before they were Sweet Children, they were briefly known as **Blood Rage**. Well, not exactly -- Mike and Billie were the only constant from one band to the other, as far as I know. 

Anyway, I didn't really know Mike, but we went to the same high school for a year or so, as did another guy by the name of Jean. Jean was one of Mike's bandmates in Blood Rage, and the band decided they needed a logo. I was the artist in my class, so Jean came to me and offered to pay me a whopping $5.00 for a drawing. Hey, it was 1986, I was fifteen years old, and $5.00 sounded okay to me. Jean described what the band wanted, and a few days later I gave him the drawing.

Well, I never actually got my five bucks, but Jean did give me one of the stickers, which I threw in a box within a week or so.

Fast forward a bit: Green Day became absolutely huge, while I became a successful comic book artist and writer (I'm currently drawing [Danger Club](http://www.imagecomics.com/comics/4696/Danger-Club-1) for Image comics). 

Through mutual friends I even collaborated with the band briefly on the design for American Idiot, though they opted to use their regular designer instead. Maybe I'll upload that art sometime, too.

The band got even more gigantic after American Idiot's release, and at some point I realized that I probably have something extremely rare, and probably quite valuable, just sitting in a box: the Blood Rage sticker.

I have never once seen another one of these stickers, not even when they were new. I have no idea how many were printed in the first place, but I'd think they wouldn't have made more than 100 or so -- Blood Rage was pretty much a heavy metal cover band that likely never did more than one or two ""gigs"", and those were probably backyard parties, all of which happened a quarter of a century ago.

Basically, I probably have the only one of these stickers in existence, and I thought you guys might like to see it. 

I apologize for the low quality black-and-white photo and the watermark, but I don't want this to get bootlegged by anybody. For the record, the original sticker is about 4.5"" x 6.5"", yellow with red blood. Oh, and I only drew the image here, I didn't select the font or the colors they used. Pretty sure that was Jean...

They've helped me through the good times and the bad. We all visit this subreddit out of the excitement we still feel towards Green Day, their music, live performances and all else that comes along with this love for them.

Whether you've been a Green Day fan since before Dookie, or you just heard of them for the first time with the coming of the latest trilogy - IT DOESN'T FUCKING MATTER. 

A fan is a fan is a fan is a fan. I am a fan. You are a fan. We are fans.

Enough of all this *""I've been listening to Green Day since XXXX...""* and *I know way more about Green Day than you* mentality. I know a lot of you in this subreddit are teenagers, but grow the fuck up and lighten up while you're at it.

1360616351.0	18bwxy	Why Nimrod is my favourite album	Obitual	67	12	22	"I'm gonna start this off by saying that I personally don't consider any of Green Day's albums to be bad.

That being said...Nimrod is their best album, and here's why:

Every single song off of Nimrod has a unique feel to it. For instance; Take Back. Take Back is arguably their most hardcore song ever. And the track right after Take Back is King For A Day, which is one of their best ""joking songs,"" and after *that* is Good Riddance.

My point is: each song brings something new to the album, and each song sounds different. But they all go together. *So. Well.*

But it's not just the fact that each song is unique, the track list is phenomenal. To this day, Scattered is one of my favourite Green Day songs. And each time I hear The Grouch or Worry Rock, I *have* to turn up the volume.

Even with American Idiot, their most iconic album ever, the same can't be said. Yes, each song is great, and each song sounds slightly different...but there's just something about the way each track off of Nimrod is blended together which is so *perfect.*

Anyway. I just felt like sharing. 'Cause I knew you guys would listen.

1. New fans: Welcome To Paradise. If you haven't listened to GD before ""Uno,"" that's perfectly fine. We are a welcoming community, and we're glad to have you.

2. Old fans: We are a welcoming community, so lets show it. If someone hasn't heard of GD before ""Uno,"" then don't disregard their opinions. If they spend more time here, then they will learn more about ""one of the most influential punk rock bands of the 90s and 00s."" Just give it time.

Why can't people just keep their mouths shut? Honestly, bands change style. Almost every band does. It doesn't mean you have to go to their facebook page, or their twitter, or whatever the fuck people use, and spam their profile with stupid bullshit about how their new music sucks. If you don't like it, then don't listen. It's that simple.
They've been called sell-outs for the past 18 years, what makes you think that they care when you say it?

Does anyone else agree with me on this?


EDIT: Some of you don't seem to get the fact that I'M NOT SAYING YOU'RE A BAD FAN IF YOU DON'T LIKE THEIR NEW MUSIC. I'm saying that if you go and insult them, call them names, say they are sell-outs, etc, just because you don't like their new music, you're a bad fan.

Speaking to Fuse, the shock-rock singer said that modern musicians were ""afraid to be in a rock band"" and claimed that the current generation need to ""quit eating vegetarian food"" and ""eat a steak"" instead. 

Asked for his views on current rock music, he said: ""I just feel that this whole generation needs to all eat a steak. Maybe they just need to quit eating vegetarian food and get out there and get some blood pumping in their system. Rock 'n' roll is not about 'Happy happy happy, everything's okay. We're The Lumineers, let's clog dance.' Hey, there's a place for that. If I wanted to see a great clog dancing band, I'd see The Lumineers.""

Using Mumford And Sons as an example, meanwhile, he went on to add: ""Mumford And Sons are great at what they do. But it's not rock 'n' roll. Don't call it rock 'n' roll. It's an offence to rock 'n' roll.

""I get they want to be folk rock, and I guess they want to look like everybody else,"" he continued. ""I'm old school when it comes to if you're in a band, you're an outlaw. You don't play by those rules, you're a rock 'n' roll outlaw. It doesn't mean you have to be on drugs,, but when you get onstage you don't play the guitar up here, and it's not an acoustic guitar. You play the guitar down here. It doesn't come from your brain, it comes from your guts. It comes from your groin. It's sexual. It's tribal.""

He finished by saying: ""Finally, I just went 'Okay – you guys don't want to be rock bands, great. That's better for us'. There's more for Foo Fighters, there's more for Green Day, more for the bands that really are rock bands. I don't understand why everybody is so afraid to be in a rock band.""

People were complaining that 21st Century Breakdown wasn't promoted enough, and now that we are getting TERRIFIC promotion, everyone is whining and bitching about it. If you think that Green Day having a version of Angry Birds is them ""selling out"", there is something wrong with you. I bet Green Day themselves didn't think of this idea, it's the marketing team, NOT GREEN DAY!

Also if you consider yourself a ""Die Hard Green Day Fan"", then you wouldn't be posting this shit.

1349806487.0	117gye	[Mod Announcement] New rules for /r/greenday	Slapdown	46	5	17	"Subreddit rules:

1. **Don't harass others** - We're all here for one thing, and that is because we're fans of Green Day. If you pick a fight with someone you get a warning and if it continues you will be banned.

2. **Use the search bar** - We have 1,700 subscribers now so odds are, there could be a post about it already. Just because it isn't on the front page doesn't mean it hasn't been posted recently so check the new queue also. News about the band is ok as long as it's from different sources. Just trying to cut down on the repost factor here.

3. **Please, no more worst/least favorite song discussions** - Best/favorite song discussions are fine because it turns into just that, a discussion. I personally don't like seeing these because it starts wars with others. Everyone does have their own opinion and we should respect that, but if someone says they don't like a song, it usually gets downvoted which is not how reddit should work. Reddiquette people, don't downvote others because you disagree, downvote if it has nothing to do with the discussion.

4. **Music video and single debut policy** - When a new song comes out everyone will try and be the first to post it. This results in the front page getting cluttered with the same thing. Just giving a heads up that it will be removed if it's been posted already.

5. **No direct links to song or album downloads** - Informing people that the leak is available and where is fine, but absolutely no direct links to sites. We can get banned and get in trouble for that sort of thing so it's better to fall on the side of caution than not. An example of an acceptable post would be: Dos! leak is finally out and on TPB for download. No links in the post, they will be removed. *Soundcloud links are still ok though*

6. **""Overused memes"" are frowned upon** - I say frowned upon because while it won't be removed, the community might not enjoy it. Examples are ""Am I the only one around here..."" and ""Brace yourselves"". They don't add much of a discussion to anything and it's not very original. My advice: Make a ""DAE"" self post if you want to get a topic started with a song you might not think most people like. Excessive use of memes haven't been a big issue here but these were brought up with good enough reasons to add it to the list I think.

7. **No deleting your comments repeatedly** - Apparently this needs to be on here for it to be in affect. Nobody likes seeing constant threads with ""deleted"" in them. Plus it ends up not adding anything to the discussion because nobody knows what was said.

That's it, nothing too serious here. Basically, we just don't want to see people being hateful and reposts everywhere. We rarely remove posts but if we do, we will give you a reason why to be fair to you.

Comments below and mod mail are welcome if you have anything to discuss or add to it. We want to hear what people think. Thanks guys.

""I really hope that you read this and understand that this is a real situation. Paige, a 17 year old girl passed away two days ago. Her loving family wanted to find a cure for her terrible epilepsy through a brain procedure, but due to complications, the surgery failed causing her brain to give out, but her heart still left beating due to life support. As I grieved with her family in the hospital room, we found the strength to play green day songs on a phone and place it next to her ear. I believe she heard it, because her heart rate just so happened to get a little faster. I am telling you this because this little girl was undoubtedly the biggest green day fan in the entire world, and anyone who knew her would agree 100%. Ever since I met her 7 years ago, she raved about her love for you guys. Posters all over her room, her green day lunch box, tons of green day clothing and Merch, every single one of your albums, etc could be found in Paige's possession. Green day was not just a band to Paige, it was her salvation. Little paige did not have an easy life. As a small child, she dealt with cancer. Thankfully she was cured, but shortly after, her extreme epilepsy developed. Her epilepsy would cause terrible, screaming seizures countless times a day; sometimes shed end up hurting herself during one. But the biggest comfort to her was listening to green day through it all. One night, when she had a terrible seizure in a restaurant, I held her and sang 'Time of your life' and she began to sing with me, holding me tight as she relaxed and stopped shaking. Every time id sleep over, I'd be awaken by a very loud seizure, silence, then her playing 'wake me up when September ends' on the piano over and over again. It soothed her more than you'll ever know. When everyone in her high school found out about her death, every student wore green in honor of Paige. In the hospital, we painted her nails green as well, so shed be buried with a symbol of green day on her. The day before her surgery, I picked her up from school. After she ran excitedly to my car, She began to tell me she had a 'wonderful dream'. I asked what it was. She told me : ""it was after my surgery and i was officially seizure free, everything was great. So as a surprise, my parents took me to another green day concert. But this time, billy joe himself asked me to come on stage. I sang with him and everyone cheered. it was the best dream of my life."" This was not just an average girl. She was the strongest, bravest, most selfless sweetheart I have ever been blessed to know. She always wanted to make people feel appreciated and loved. I cannot let this all go without at least trying to get your attention for her. I know she's up there watching me, and her strength that she had here on earth fuels me even more to get you guys to do something for her funeral. Everyone who found this story touching should like this post, so maybe green day themselves can notice. Paige left this earth with you guys inside her heart, please let her inside yours. Thank you. My email is vtaraborelli@gmail.com. 
I LOVE YOU PAIGE.""

Opinions about the meaning of this song range from a call for revolution (""Where have all the riots gone?"") to the nearing end of the world (""Where will we all go when it's too late?""), and probably there is a little bit of everything in this song, going along one of the most important turns in the story of the album.

The song begins with a female voice singing the lines that will later recur: ""nobody likes you, everyone left you..."" This might be Whatsername pointing out Jesus' failure to have a decent social life, but it just as well might be his subconsciousness playing a cruel joke on him and making him feel worthless and insecure. Everything around him seems so fake - nothing is stable, nothing is forever. No one wants to fight for their beliefs anymore (""Where have all the riots gone? As your city's motto gets pulverized""). Jesus failed to be a rebel, his life in the city was a sand castle built on lies and pretence - and it fell apart. He didn't want to be Jesus of Suburbia, but he couldn't handle being Jimmy - and now he's neither (""You're not the Jesus of Suburbia. The St. Jimmy is a figment of your father's rage and your mother's love...""). His war with himself led to a crash of his relationship with Whatsername. His fake personality wasn't enough to keep her by his side and she leaves the City and Jesus behind. ""It's not over till you're underground"" ‒ she still has a chance to try and start a new life somewhere else. Which she does.

**Song meaning** :


This song is filled with so much creative profanity that its lyrics are not even printed in the album inlay. (""The lyrics to Platypus will not be on the CD because of lawyer problems due to my potty mouth"" - Armstrong). 

In Platypus the narrator verbally attacks a person that has not only hurt him in the past, but also took pleasure in doing so. But then all the foul deeds backfired and the object of the narrator's hatred is now haunted by all the pain he's caused other people. What goes around comes around and now everyone hates them and it's stupid to pretend that they enjoy it or don't care.

The song is said to be directed towards a journalist that Green Day had an unpleasant experience with. Supposedly he wrote good reviews about the band's music before Dookie, but then when the band became popular the critic changed his mind and pissed the band off with the way he acted. Platypus was the band's reply. Armstrong decided not to put the song on Insomniac, but instead released it on Nimrod because he felt it would show the critic that they've grown. The lyrics openly show the author's attitude towards this person and even expresses that it's a pleasure to know that he is sick and is going to die.

What I want to know is why other people on Reddit have these negative feelings pointed at Green Day--it's pretty obvious that they're hated on much more than a lot of other bands.  People claim they sold out, and that there new stuff is terrible, but is it really that bad?  All of this negativity towards Green Day seems to be coming from something different, but what?

Also, I know it's a somewhat ridiculous idea, but how could we sort of shift the general negativity for Green Day away?  Obviously it's really difficult to change opinions, but the anti-Green Day circle-jerk threads on /r/Music and /r/Punk are very frustrating, blaming the band for something they're not really in control of.  

**EDIT**: Yes, I know people are entitled to their opinions, as that is pretty obvious.  How people view things is obviously out of my control, and I understand that.  I was simply asking how we could get a better name for Green Day out there--I think they deserve more than general internet notoriety, even if people do view them as a three-chord pop boy band.

News and other big media companies that typically never give Green Day a second glance are jumping all over the opportunity to say something negative. 

Maybe it's just me, but doesn't it feel like the media is so overwhelmingly cruel today? Like everyone is just sitting there... waiting for someone to fall down... waiting for someone to make a mistake... so they can talk about it for someone else's viewing pleasure? It's so sick and twisted to me... 

Even the rhetoric they use ""public meltdown"", ""ferocious rant"", etc.. we get it. He flipped his lid a little and then went to rehab. Leave him alone for crying out loud. He'll be fine. As fans, we can sort of grasp an understanding of BJ's actions and we all know that, either way, he's stronger than this, but if you look at it through the eyes of the media, he's a lunatic sociopath who hates Justin Beiber. Give me a break. 

PS - I'm not saying that just because I'm a Green Day fan, I want the media to just back off of BJ. I think they should get off of everyone's case. Ex: Lindsay Lohan in another hit and run! Who cares? Leave her alone. "	t5_2snhx	True

And needless to say, we all loved it and were amazed at it's solo. Stay The Night live version came out followed by Let Yourself Go and Kill The DJ. And of course, the first time we heard 99 revolutions live at Japan. Uno was leaked and everyone was not disappointed.


Then, tragedy struck. Billie had a meltdown at iHeart and went for rehab. Many concerts were cancelled but Tre's release date was pushed forward. Stray Heart then came out as a new single for Dos and Stop When The Red Lights Flash live was released on YouTube. Dos leaked and people on the sub-reddit raged about Nightlife while others had a new love for this unique song (which we would never expect from Green Day).


Not long after, The Forgotten came out as a twilight song (there were people raging obviously) and Drama Queen due to a misprint. Quatro came out, revealing a fragment of the awesomeness which was about to unveil to us in an album called Tre. Dirty Rotten Bastards intro was finally heard, along with previews of X-Kid and Missing You. And here we all are. Waiting for both the official and leak versions of the album.


It really didn't seem that long ago when this sub-reddit was practically dead and had the Kerplunk background and the [Green Day aliens](http://i.imgur.com/eStar.png). Then, people started coming in and the Nimrod theme was used, followed by our current theme. Along the road, we hit 1039 subs and had flairs implemented. 


And guys, the trilogy is about to end. In about a few hours or a week, we'll all be wondering, what's next? 


More fantastic live performances? 


A b-side album? 


Cigarettes and valentines rerecorded for the 10th anniversary of American Idiot?

Listening to this trilogy has been an absolute delight. Particularly the bass on the album jumps out to me more than any other album they have put out.  The bass seems really prevalent throughout the trilogy and I love Mike's tone. A lot of the songs feature the bass at the forefront,  i.e. Stray Heart, Nuclear Family (verse) just to name a few. Just thought I would throw it out there. Love learning these songs as well, lots of fun! Anyway, enjoy the trilogy!	t5_2snhx	True

1349104823.0	10ri1w	As requested, here are the results (at least, the ones that I could see) from the r/GreenDay survey earlier in the week	shadowslayer978	40	3	18	"And what I mean by ""at least, the ones I could see"" is that since I don't donate to Survey Monkey, I can only see the last 100 results.  That makes the results less accurate, obviously, but it still helps us understand what the average /r/GreenDay fan is like.  So lets get started!


The vast majority of Green Day fans on this subreddit are male, at 75.5% to the female 24.5%  I'm not surprised that it is lopsided, but I am surprised that it is *that* lopsided.  I know a bunch of Green Day fans in real life, and while there definitely are more males than females, it's much closer to 50/50. 


The average age of Green Day fans on here is about 18.  I'm going to date myself by saying this, but I'm surprised that it is that low (we'll sort of get into why in a little bit).  I was expecting it to be more around my age, 25 I guess, but again, we'll get into why in a little bit.


Most GD fans are from US/Canada/North/Central America, and since USA is included that, I can't say I am surprised.  The actual percentage is 73%.  Europe came in at a distant second with 22%, followed by Australia (4%) and then Africa and Asia both tied at 1%.  What I was most surprised by here is that there are NO /r/greenday fans from South America! I wonder why that is.  I mean, at the very least, out of that 100, I thought that at least one person would be from Brazil or something, but I guess not.  Strange.


Most of you (41%) don't have a high school degree, which makes sense since the average age of the fans here is 17-18.  Nearly the same amount actually have a high school degree (32%), and 15% of you have been to college but haven't received a degree yet (which is because, I am assuming, you are still in college).  No one on the subreddit has an associates degree, but 8% of you have earned a bachelor's degree.  Finally, 2% are really smart cookies that have earned at least a graduate degree (or doctorate /Ph.D.).


American Idiot was the first record that over half (55%) of you have listened to.  Now, lets go back to why I was surprised about the average age of fans on the subreddit: since American Idiot came out 8 years ago, and the average age is 18, that means that the average fan on this subreddit was 10 years old when AI came out, and they have been listening to Green Day for almost half of their lives!! Wicked!  I wish I could say that about myself, but as AI was the first album I really listened to as well, and I am 25, there is about 17 years of my life where I didn't know Green Day.  For shame, I know. Here is a chart with the rest of the results: http://imgur.com/m7cy4  Can't say I'm surprised that Dookie and American Idiot are the most popular choices, as GD experienced surges in popularity when those two albums came out.


Here are the results of the ""Favorite Green Day Album"" question: http://imgur.com/y9p6j  Again, here is a case of something that I'm not really surprised about. American Idiot, Dookie and Nimrod were the results I was expecting to be in the top 3 here based on just talking to my friends. What I am surprised about is the number of people who responded with Uno!  Will that record stand the test of time for you guys (not that it's a bad album, it's just so *new*)?

Edit: Fuck Reddit's formatting for numbers and tables.  If a song has a number to the right of it, that's the number of responses that the song had.  If a song doesn't have a response number, then it is the same as the one above it.

The average fan has seen Green Day almost 1 time, but a vast majority of you have never seen them live.  This is possible because someone has seen them 20+ times (I just used the number 20 for that response).  I am surprised that there were that many ""0"" responses! I feel bad for you guys!


A small majority of you do not own Green Day: Rock Band: 53.6% to 43.4%.  I'm surprised hat more don't own it, as it is a great game, and is really fun to play with all of your friends.


Here is how you guys listen to Green Day: http://imgur.com/uxBOA
Only thing surprising there is that some of you still listen on your cassette tapes! haha


Again, thank you for taking this survey for me.  I found the results very interesting and I hope you do too.

1358231952.0	16lt7q	New Subreddit Rules, Guidelines, and Moderation Policies.	Garin2010	39	2	28	"Sup peeps, 

Here are the newly revised rules and some guidelines of r/GreenDay-

**Don’t harass other members**

* r/GreenDay is meant to be a gathering place for redditors to talk about the band and interact with other fans on Reddit. Verbally abusing someone because of a difference in opinion or any other reason is not allowed.
* If you feel like you are being harassed whilst posting in r/GreenDay, immediately message the moderators with a link to the conversation, and possibly a screenshot of the conversation so that proper action can be dealt with. Each person has one warning, and then they are banned from posting to r/GreenDay.

**Utilize the Search Bar** 

* r/GreenDay has grown steadily ever since it was first created more than a year ago. As of this posting, the community is on its way to 2,500 members. Therefore, it is possible that your original submission idea has already been done, or your discussion question idea has already been done. Searching will let you know if you have an original thought, or if four other people have beaten you to the punch.
* __**Insanely obvious reposted threads or submissions will be removed.**__

**Favorite and Least Favorite submissions, along with polls, and surveys are up for approval**

* These threads can at any time be removed by a moderator


**Collection or merchandise posts must be categorized as: [MERCH]**

* This includes CDs, vinyl, shirts, accessories, tickets, and screenshots of digital collections.
* Posts that are not properly labeled will be removed and the poster allowed to repost their submission with the tag. This follows the same “three infractions rule”

***THE DOWNVOTE BUTTON IS MEANT FOR DISCUSSION THAT IS NOT RELEVANT OR CONSTRUCTIVE TO THE CURRENT CONVERSATION. NOT TO SHOW DISAPPROVAL OR DISAGREEMENT WITH AN OPINION.***

**Image Macros and “Memes” will be removed upon the discretion of the moderators**

* Regardless of the submission’s popularity, posts that are thought to be of low quality is subject to removal.
* Appeals will not be accepted. Measure of quality is under the discretion of the moderators of r/GreenDay.

**After the first post on a significant piece has been put up, any subsequent duplicate submissions will be removed.**

* This includes tour dates, music videos, social media posts, and other news.
* NO. EXCEPTIONS.

**It is encouraged to report rule breaking content**

* Reporting things you see on the sub that break any of these guidelines help contribute to the greater effort of improving the quality of the subreddit. The moderators all have personal lives that require them to be away from their positions a large majority of the time. It helps us out and keeps the crap away!
* Some cool things may await you.

**Posting meaningful, constructive, and interesting content may get you some neat stuff!**

* More info to be added later, Billie is yet to finish signing the instruments.

**Utilize the “Message the Moderators” link for any concerns or questions**

* We love feedback. If you have any questions about the rules or anything about the subreddit, use the link on the sidebar to get our attention. We will respond ASAP. We won’t hurt you severely. ^^Maybe.

**Links to pirated or illegally downloaded material will be removed immediately**

* This includes comments or submissions asking for torrents or downloads. We don't want to see links to thepiratebay on the front page.



*Subject to change upon the discretion and approval of the moderators of r/GreenDay

As per recent developments in the community, the moderators and I felt that it was appropriate that there be a revision of the current rules and guidelines of the subreddit. 

These were introduced as part of an effort to improve the quality of the subreddit. These will be enforced **STRICTLY** by myself and the other moderators

Please post your thoughts and ideas about the revision of the rules, our moderation, and anything else administrative in this thread.

Now I may have my facts wrong but I do think that he was just drunk; and the media won't stop calling booze, substance, as if it's some super drug.

correct me if I'm wrong but I think Billie's only in rehab to help him stop getting drunk again. Any thoughts? "	t5_2snhx	True

They should seriously take a little break and not do so many concerts in one go as you know, they are not as strong or energetic as last time, so they are much more vulnerable than their older, marijuana days. 

I mean, traveling to Japan, then to Reading Festival, then to France within a few days is more than enough to exhaust them. Even the jet lag is enough although they are probably used to it by now but still. I'm pretty sure I would be at the hospital to if I didn't get any proper rest for almost a week.

Get well soon Billie! And of course, what do you guys think about them? Do they need a break and not rush things? Or do you think they will do this 'chain' again and get another breakdown?"	t5_2snhx	True

The song of the week this week is 86 from Insomniac.
 **Song Meaning:** Found [here](http://www.geekstinkbreath.net/greenday/song-meanings/86/)

""""It's kind of about this conversation I had with someone when I went back to Gilman last December [1994], I ran into this old friend of mine and all he could say was, 'Wow, what the fuck are you doing here?'"" - Armstrong.
The term ""86"" in this song is referring to being banned from or thrown out of a place or social circle.
The song was inspired by what happened between Green Day and Gilman Street after the band got big. After the release of Dookie Green Day were rejected by the punk community they had once been a part of because now they were apparently “sell outs”. The lyrics, however, are not just about the people from Gilman Street. The narrator cynically repeats the words of a person they were once close with who now tells them to get out and never come back. That person accuses the narrator of losing his identity and thus being unworthy of their company, let alone friendship. 

It’s interesting that the lyrics don’t actually say that that person is wrong. They merely describe what has been said leaving the decision about whether those words are just or not to the listener. However, the rage and regret that the song is filled with show how emotionally attached the musicians are to that song since it was inspired by their personal experience.""

TL;DR: Some guys at Gilman Street called GD sell outs after Dookie, told them to get fucked so Billie Joe wrote 86. 86 is a term for being thrown out of a social circle apparently.

1367587130.0	1dm81g	[SONG OF THE WEEK] F.O.D (Dookie)	potlah	36	8	20	"**Song meaning** :

**Fuck Off and Die**... a song describing a truly horrible feeling that a lot of us have to experience at some point in life. And that would be having to deal with a person you absolutely cannot stand. That often happens with a colleague, boss, classmate or even a parent - you have to see that person every day, communicate with them and pretend that your relationship is fine, while in your dreams you see yourself slowly cutting their head off and enjoying every second of it. And, of course, every once in a while you have major fights - torching the bridge between you, but you still have to see each other every day, so you keep putting those fires out.

But the hatred and irritation keeps ""burning in your guts"", and one day you just spew it all out telling the object of your disgust how much you really despise them - telling them to fuck off and die. What a relief...

Musically the song consists of 2 parts - the quiet one and the loud one. This basically demonstrates the 2 stages of this hateful relationship - first you deal with that person and keep suppressing your anger, and then you spit it all out. And this bottled up rage is so destructive for your dignity that when you finally burst, you feel almost proud of finally telling the truth - and the more insulting it is the better you feel...

1366997142.0	1d5ypq	Story Time [A bit long, sorry]	basketcaserebel	31	3	12	So recently, I had oral surgery. Basically they had to tear my gums open, pull down two impacted teeth and attach chains to them, with me being awake the whole time. (Just imagine the Geek Stink Breath video times 10) After the ordeal was over, frankly I was a bit traumatized by the experience and glad to have it over with. But a week or so afterwards, the chains came off and I was told I would have to go through the surgery /again/.  Of course, I was absolutely terrified when I learned this and by the time I got there again, I was so scared that my entire body was shaking and it was difficult for them to operate. They were afraid they might have to cancel the procedure and make me have a more extreme surgery (that would be much more painful afterwards) where I'd be asleep unless I calmed down but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't. They were pretty much about to give up when Time of Your Life (Good Riddance) came on the radio. The second I heard the beginning of the song I started to relax and about halfway through it, I had stopped shaking enough for them to carry on with the procedure. I just thought I might share this here, I know it's a bit boring. But I was just wondering if any of you had an experience where Green Day has gotten you through a bit of a tough time. I know many of their fans have even had their lives saved by them, I was just wondering if any of you have experiences to share. :)	t5_2snhx	True

My little story:

Back in 09 during the 21st Century tour, I was with my friends waiting outside the coliseum for the show to start. We were really excited and I told my friends to look for tour buses with a California licence plate, maybe a band member would be inside one? While they were staring down playing my little licence plate game, my eyes wandered off to a black tour buses window. I saw a guy looking through it, wearing Oakley sunglasses, had brown combed back hair and then I realized it was Tre Cool just 10 feet from me, staring me down. Eventually the bus passed by, and I told my friends... ""Guys... I just saw Tre Cool eyeing me down"" and they went ""Was he in that tour bus with the California licence plate? Damn we didn't look at the windows!"". What I found interesting was that Tre bleached his hair while backstage, so he didn't have brown hair during the actual concert. "	t5_2snhx	True

1356394304.0	15ebz8	¡Uno! ¡Dos! ¡Tre! - Made my year	depricatedzero	28	3	11	"I've been a fan of Green Day for nearly 20 years. I thought American Idiot was brilliant, and then I heard 21st Century Breakdown and lost all hope. It sounded...wrong, to me. At least at first glance. It's definitely my least favorite GD album, but after giving it time I have come to enjoy it. It's the only one where I've had to examine songs to find the Green Day sound in them though, to feel like they hadn't just tossed it all for a Guitar Hero album. 

At any rate: I picked up Uno the other day. I was skeptical, considering. Got in my car, popped the CD in, and immediately I was taken back 15 years. It shares the sounds of Nimrod and Warning, more polished, current, and clearly carrying on some of the sound from American Idiot and 21. I sat and basked in it, just enjoying the sound I've been waiting for year after year. American Idiot was good, but it was a shift in sound. I was ok with that.

My brother picked me up Dos and Tre for Christmas - apparently he had gotten a 3 disc set and wanted to choke me when he found out I bought Uno lol. So I've been listening to those as well.

I have to say...this is Green Day. These albums are quintessential Green Day - absolutely perfect. Any of these songs would be right at home on Nimrod, and some of them fit perfectly even with 1039 - Insomniac.

tl;dr - Been a fan for nearly 20 years, feel like Uno Dos and Tre are amazing and perfectly represent the band's sound"	t5_2snhx	True

Slowly I went off American Idiot, but it was hard because it was the first real guitar music that I got into. I still have that attachment.

When 21stCB came around, I liked it a lot to begin with, and I think it slowly changed. To be honest, I genuinely think the only reason I liked it to begin with was my attachment to the older albums. I don't know how many of you are similar to me in how you like your Green Day, but I just wanted to share my opinion. I've started listening to ¡Uno! today, and I quite like it. There are some songs that I think are a bit cheesy, but I can get over it. 

Can you guys share your Green Day story, and opinions on the new album?
