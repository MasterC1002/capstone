― C.G. Jung"	taylorhart	41	12	2	"Be silent and listen: have you recognized your madness and do you admit it? 
Have you noticed that all your foundations are completely mired in madness? 
Do you not want to recognize your madness and welcome it in a friendly manner? 

You wanted to accept everything. So accept madness too. 
Let the light of your madness shine, and it will suddenly dawn on you. 
Madness is not to be despised and not to be feared, but instead you should give it life...If you want to find paths, you should also not spurn madness, since it makes up such a great part of your nature...

Be glad that you can recognize it, for you will thus avoid becoming its victim. 
Madness is a special form of the spirit and clings to all teachings and philosophies, but even more to daily life, since life itself is full of craziness and at bottom utterly illogical. 

Man strives toward reason only so that he can make rules for himself. 
Life itself has no rules. 


That is its mystery and its unknown law. 

What you call knowledge is an attempt to impose something comprehensible on life.

General Douglas A. MacArthur 
Build me a son, O Lord, 
who will be strong enough to know when he is weak, 
and brave enough to face him self when he is afraid; 
one who will be proud and unbending in honest defeat, 
and humble and gentle in victory.

Build me a son whose wishbone will not be 
where his backbone should be;
a son who will know Thee- and that 
to know himself is the foundation stone of knowledge. 

Lead him, I pray, not in the path of ease and comfort, 
but under the stress and spur of difficulties and challenge. 
Here, let him learn to stand up in the storm; 
here, let him teem compassion for those who fall.

Build me a son whose heart will be clear, whose goals will be high; 
a son who will master himself before he seeks to master other men; 
one who will learn to laugh, yet never forget how to weep; 
one who will reach into the future, yet never forget the past.

And after all these things are his, 
add, I pray, enough of a sense of humor, 
so that he may always be serious, 
yet never take himself too seriously. 

Give him humility, so that he may always remember 
the simplicity of true greatness, 
the open mind of true wisdom, 
the meekness of true strength. 

Then I, his father, will dare to whisper, 
""I have not lived in vain.""

my motive is not, I hope, the wish to belittle them. It springs rather from my conviction that, if our civilization is 
to survive, we must break with the habit of deference to great men. Great men may make great mistakes; and 
as the book tries to show, some of the greatest leaders of the past supported the perennial attack on freedom 
and reason. Their influence, too rarely challenged, continues to mislead those on whose defence civilization 
depends, and to divide them. The responsibility of this tragic and possibly fatal division becomes ours if we 
hesitate to be outspoken in our criticism of what admittedly is a part of our intellectual heritage. By reluctance 
to criticize some of it, we may help to destroy it all.

&gt;Science tells us what we can know but what we can know is little and if we forget how much we cannot know we become insensitive of many things of very great importance.

I'm a teacher at a charter school in the west side of Chicago. I'm looking for some inspirational/educational/wisdom/etc quotes for my students. They're high schoolers, grades 9-12, and are the coolest kids you'll ever meet.

What I need from you all are some of your favorite quotes that you think could really speak to high school students. I've always considered myself an apt quote hound, but I thought I'd turn to the power Reddit to put something together that's really special.

1342765137.0	wv0ze	[R] Finding a quote about comedy and seriousness	freedan12	8	3	0	"Hi everyone so I need help finding a quote by a comedian I think. Some of you may know the controversy with the tumblr girl's friend and Daniel Tosh. Well forget that, this doesn't really have anything to do with that. In one of the threads I think, around July 12th there was a great post that a redditor commented a comedian who was talking about comedy and seriousness and I want to find that. The threads were about like rape and in regards to the the whole controversy. I've spent probably 6 hours, googling, searching reddit, the threads, and etc to find it, but I can't so I turn to you guys. Also I has to do with theamazingatheist's video on the tumblr feminists at the end where he talks about dark humor if that puts anything into perspective here's the [video](http://youtu.be/5eCnmeaoGMA?t=10m24s) at that time stamp where he talks about it. Hopefully you can help.


I paraphrased it but it's not as good as the original and I want to know the original name. It's something like this:

***""laughter is all based on perception and comedy lies in a fine line between funny and seriousness, if you see a guy fall and slip on his back from far away you might laugh. But if you are standing too close you'll see something else and may not laugh"" - ????*** 

If you could please help me find the exact words and author that would be great. Thanks!

tl;dr: I need help finding a quote by a comedian that is something like ""laughter is all based on perception and comedy lies in a fine line between funny and seriousness, if you see a guy fall and slip on his back from far away you might laugh.

And we are all responsive to sexual stimuli from our own as well as from the opposite sex. Certain societies at certain times, usually in the interest of maintaining the baby supply, have discouraged homosexuality. Other societies, particularly militaristic ones, have exalted it. But regardless of tribal taboos, homosexuality is a constant fact of the human condition and it is not a sickness, not a sin, not a crime ... despite the best efforts of our puritan tribe to make it all three. Homosexuality is as natural as heterosexuality. Notice I use the word 'natural,' not normal. - Gore Vidal

Went to about 500 and then noticed these annoying trends:

1)


If you have quotes about athiesm, you really should post it in r/athiesm. Why? Because you'll get more upvotes from the circlejerk, and there are a metric shit ton of them already. probably 1/6 of all 500 were on athiesm, maybe even more.

edit: my point is (because I know this is a touchy one with a lot of you) that we all know how easy it is to disprove religion, repeating it is almost as insane as this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPHnT-hkzKo


2)

If there is an image form of your quote, use that instead so that lazy people like me can just do the chrome hover click thingey


3)

If your quote is half a page long, maybe you should try to shorten it and then post it. I find that the most profound, potent quotes are normally the shortest.


4)

Similar to the athiesm thing, there are a metric fuck ton of carl sagan posts and just space like posts in general. I'm pretty sure everyone only needs a reminder that space is awesome once per page, not 5 times.


5)

if you think that annoying girl from high school will like your quote, don't post it, because it's probably not profound at all.


Anyway, I found some gems, but I really don't want to subscribe because I then would have to go subscribe to all the circlejerk type subreddits

I think one is objects, but the other one is the web. The web is incredibly exciting because it is the fulfillment of a lot of our dreams that the computer would ultimately not be primarily a device for computation but metamorphosize into a device for communication. And with the web, that's finally happening. And secondly, it's exciting 'cause Microsoft doesn't own it, and therefore there's a tremendous amount of innovation happening. So I think that the web is going to be profound in what it does to our society.

Another way to think about it is, the smallest company in the world can look as large as the largest company in the world on the web.

1364622573.0	1bagbz	The fact that Americans will remain wilfully ignorant of the big red white and blue dick that's being jammed up their asses everyday. - George Carlin	Jakewilliamm	2	3	0	"""Forget the politicians. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. You don't. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you. They own everything. They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations. They've long since bought, and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies. So they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear. They got you by the balls. they spend billions of dollars every year lobbying. Lobbying, to get what they want.

Well we know what they want. they want more for themselves and less for everybody else, but I'll tell you what they don't want. They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don't want well informed, well educated people capable of critical thinking. They're not interested in that. that doesn't help them. That's against their interests. That's right. They don't want people who are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table and think about howbadly they're getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fuckin' years ago. They dont want that.

You know what they want? they want obedient workers. obedient workers, people who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork. And just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime and vanishing pensions that disappear the minute you go to collect it, and now thy're coming for your social security money. They want your fuckin' retirement money. They want it back so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street, and you know something? THEY'LL GET IT. They'll get it all from you sooner or later cause they own this fuckin' place. it's a big club and you aint in it. You and I are not in the big club. By the way, it's the same big club they use to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe. All day long beating you over the head with their media telling you what to believe, what to think and what to buy.

The table has tilted, folks. The game is rigged. And nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care. Good honest hard-working people - white collar, blue collar, it doesn't matter what color shirt you have on. Good honest hard-working people continue - these are people of modest means - continue to elect these rich cocksuckers who dont give a fuck about you. they dont give a fuck about you. THEY DONT GIVE A FUCK ABOUT YOU! They dont care about you at all. AT ALL. And nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care.

Thats what the owner count on. The fact that Americans will remain wilfully ignorant of the big red, white and blue dick that's being jammed up their assholes every day, because the owners of this country know the truth. it's called the American dream because you have to be asleep to believe it."" - George Carlin (may 12, 1937 - June 22, 2008)"	t5_2svfw	True
