1376120911.0	1k2vwm	Please help my web site is blowing up and I'm not equipped to deal with this.	-oh-no	1406	392	636	"I'm very new to programming only have about 8-10 months of experience... About 3 months ago I decided to stop messing around and made my first 'actual' web site.  This being a social net work built with php and html5. 
I finished it last month and It already has 3500 -4000 users, and a few hundred more people are signing up every day. I AM FREAKING OUT. I don't know how to deal with this. I know nothing about what servers to upgrade to or how to even do so. I have little to no experience in testing things along the nature of sql injection and other sorts of plausable attacks against me. I'm just one guy who made one web site for fun. I'm currently in university and had to sell my cell phone to get money for better servers. Please help. I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm 20 years and getting a degree in chemistry. I can't afford this web site. I have about 50$ a month of spare money and now an extra 200$ from my cell phone that I sold.  I don't even know what server to upgrade to. How can I find reliable people to help me? Where do I go from here? When do i drop out of school!?  How do I make my money back? I really just don't know. Please help me

1350586112.0	11pbj1	dude. you guys. I (apparently) nailed my very first interview ever and totally just got a real job as a web developer. now what?	workbootstowebdev	395	71	167	"*tl;dr -- self taught former construction guy got a job as a webdev because of you. thanks.*

So here's my deal:

Got fired from my job as a construction project manager 18 months ago. decided to pivot my career and started sort of teaching myself to build websites. I'm a 38 year old white guy. Shocking, I know.

It's because of [this](http://reddit.com/r/webdev) subreddit, as well as [r/webdesign](http://reddit.com/r/webdesign) and [r/javascript](http://reddit.com/r/javascript) that I accidentally learned enough about modern web development to make a nicely designed site or two and stick 'em on the internets.

Last Friday I had my very first interview in this industry with a fairly large digital agency in a major us metropolitan area, and apparently I did ok, because they sent an offer letter yesterday, which I promptly signed and returned, lest they change their mind...

So I start Monday. I'm pretty stoked. And pretty scared, but in a good way, I think. 

I just think that it's so cool that I was able to learn enough about getting a job on the internet to get a job making the internet. ON. THE. INTERNET.

So thanks, Internet. Seriously. This is like a real job type job with benefits and stuff. You guys did great.

I'd ask for tips or advice, but I think I already read all those threads...feel free to throw in your protips, though...

(I created a throwaway account because I don't want to fuck this up somehow. Stranger things have happened, and usually do)

EDIT: 

Thanks for all the kind words, everybody. 

For brevity's sake, here's **the top 5 things I did that I think were helpful in getting a job:**

*tl:dr - learn the modern technologies, the useful tools, and the industry best practices - then make something really simple with it, and be able to talk about it.*

* I started out not specifically trying to Learn How To Be A Web Developer. I started by trying to build a website at ""myfirstandlastname.com"" to put my resume on and get another job as a construction engineer. I think that was helpful in giving me an impetus to learn. I quickly realized I had no idea what I was doing, but I just kept reading and trying things. 

* When I finally decided that I needed to more actively do some of the learnings, I started with [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org). I found that approach super helpful, and it ended up being a good foundation, I think. I didn't really *learn* python, really, but it introduced me to the importance of precision. It was essentially just typing things straight from the lessons, but in hindsight the repetition was useful to get my brain thinking in a different way.

* I then spent probably 7-8 months wandering around on the internet reading and learning everything I could about how the web worked. I did tons of tutorials, set up a github account, and when I couldn't make something work, I kept trying different things until I could. I read tons of stuff on Stack Overflow, often just because I found it interesting. I listened to podcasts. I tried Ruby, and Rails. I did Node.js tutorials. (The NodeUp podcast is really good, btw). I learned how to use the command line. I learned how to use Vim. It just all started to intertwine into one thing, really.

* This spring, I read [this post](http://rmurphey.com/blog/2012/04/12/a-baseline-for-front-end-developers) and realized that I was actually pretty familiar with the technologies set forth as the ""baseline for front-end developers"". I then decided to put forth some effort to actually finishing a few projects, revising my resume, and maybe getting like, a JOB. 

* I built a portfolio site that looked pretty good. super simple, static html pages. I also built a simple blog using Node.js (I used a module called [Quill](https://github.com/theycallmeswift/quill))and deployed it to Heroku using git. I made a couple simple wordpress sites for domains I had bought previously for no real reason, put them up, linked them to my portfolio. I cleaned up the blog I made for my kid using Octopress and used that on my portfolio. I made a nice resume, highlighting myself as a 'dedicated self-learner' with a passion for modern software development who had previously succeeded in a professional setting as a construction engineer. I put everything on Dice, and started getting contacted by recruiters pretty quickly. I got pretty lucky, I think. Found a recruiter (he found me, actually) who got me an interview pretty quick, and now here we go.

I probably should start writing about this experience. There's a lot of stuff, now that I think about it. "	t5_2qs0q	True

1344505583.0	xxkro	Website stolen my markup but still references my JavaScript - what evil things can I do?	kryptonite-addict	263	44	200	"I've recently come across a website that's stolen my markup.  Not just taken influence from it, but fully taken a copy, changed the logo, put their details in it, and put it up on their own domain.  'Their' CSS and JavaScript even still contains my original copyright notice and email address at the top.

I've already gone through the motions of contacting them (no reply) and putting  a notice in with Google (no longer listed in their search results).

What I've realised, however, is that their website still loads a chunk of JavaScript off my own server. 

At the moment I'm rewriting this request through a PHP file which spits out a random line of jQuery from an array.  These do anything from redirecting the page request to random YouTube videos, to rearranging the positioning and font colours of random DOM elements on the page.  The hope is that with the really random behaviour, it will take them a while to work out exactly what's causing it.

So, my question to you lovely folk is: what can I feed into their website via this file to really mess with them?

**tl;dr:** give me your best website-screw-up one-line pieces of JavaScript!



**UPDATE:**
I want to thank everybody for your dastardly ideas and damning pieces of code, it's been fun!  It is safe to say that their website will never be quite the same..!

One comment here in particular struck me though, from [zzendak](http://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/xxkro/website_stolen_my_markup_but_still_references_my/c5qgubr).  I've now opted simply to redirect their site on page load back to my own and display [this message](http://i.imgur.com/hDO5X.png) to them.

They work in a very similar field to me (albeit in a totally different country), so what better way to regain a slice of control than through taking away their website visitors and seeing if I can't service their clients better? 




**UPDATE 2:**
It's all over folks!  The website owner finally got back in touch and admitted to ignoring me for the past several days.  They were pretty angry that I had Tweeted at a couple of their clients asking them if they could confirm contact details, but at least that finally forced them to get in touch.

The website is nolonger up and I've had confirmation from them that they won't repost it.  if they do, I suppose I'll just have to start redirecting them again!

Thanks for all the brilliant ideas, I'll have to keep hold of them for next time!

Earlier, I received notice from GD that my transfers were being denied on the basis of a contact info change, and they would be available for transfer on 2/20/2012.  Is this BS?  Any way around this?  I'm beyond frustrated with GD at this point.  (At no point was I warned that I was going to go into lock down against transfers when I updated my contact info).

The best part about this?  A number of the hostage domains are subject to renewal within the next 30-45 days, so I will have to pay GD to keep them alive while I wait out this 60-day window after which I can transfer my domains again.

------------------------------

**EDIT -**

I just received a note from Namecheap, and the rep at Namecheap said to keep banging on GD.  He said ""I have been aware of success stories of individuals being persistent that GoDaddy staff cracks and releases the hold as the their policy is against ICANN policy.""

Namecheap is awesome."	t5_2qs0q	True
1359860377.0	17sdbn	Darkstrap.css, a dark theme for Twitter Bootstrap v2.2. (Update: Sucks less!)	danneu	181	25	52	"### Darkstrap.css

* Demo: [Darkstrap vs Bootstrap](http://danneu.com/bag/darkstrap/darkstrap.html)
* Github: https://github.com/danneu/darkstrap

It turns the lights out on the default Twitter Bootstrap theme.

Just load `darkstrap.css` after your `bootstrap.css`. It's just an override.

    &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;link href='stylesheets/bootstrap.css' rel='stylesheet' /&gt;
      &lt;link href='stylesheets/darkstrap.css' rel='stylesheet' /&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;

### Why?

I got tired of wearing sunglasses while making my menagerie of cookie-cutter Bootstrap sites. I'm sort of a troglodyte.

### Didn't you post it here before?

Yeah, a year ago. People liked it but unfortunately the project that I was making it for languished and my progress halted. Darkstrap went nowhere. But it warms my icy heart that people would periodically email me asking if I ever planned on updating it. 

### What's new?

Over the course of a few Sideproject Saturdays, I put effort into updating Darkstrap. The original release a year ago probably missed out on 25% of Bootstrap's features. So I rewrote my demo page to try and cover every Bootstrap feature this time.

It basically sucks less, particularly across browsers. It still needs some work, but I'm on a roll this time.

### ""Darkstrap"" sounds erotic.

I didn't even notice that until I googled the name to see if anybody had mentioned my theme in the *blogosphere* and stumbled upon some erotic literature. It wasn't very good, but maybe there's some overlap between dark strap fetishes and people that need a dark Bootstrap theme.

### I hope you like it.

I'm not much of a designer and I've only tested it on OSX with my eyes. 

I'm open to input and I'd love to hear if the contrast sucks or if I went overboard.

Or if you're someone with taste and have an opinion. 
Or if it's broken.

Or if you want to kill it with fire.

IE7 and IE8 don't have this issue.

**Example**

The below won't work because the first name is 33 characters long including the quotes, and the second name is 32 characters including the preceding comma, quotes, and trailing semicolon.

    font-family: ""proxima-nova-extra-condensed-n2"",""proxima-nova-extra-condensed"";

The below works, because the name is exactly 31 characters including quotes and trailing semicolon:

    font-family: ""proxima-nova-extra-condensed"";

And the below also works, because the quote-less name at the end is 30 characters including the preceding comma and trailing semicolon:

    font-family: ""proxima-nova-extra-condensed-n2"",""proxima-nova-extra-condensed"",proxima-nova-extra-condensed;

If you're declaring your own @font-face, keep the name under 27 characters to allow for quotes, commas and semicolons (spaces don't seem to matter). If you're using a service like Typekit or Google Fonts, well, you're SOL.

Apart from really shoddy performance and unacceptable down-times, I've also had VPS' taken offline because I was ""hammering the disk"" (which happens infrequently - every 3-6 months - when I import data into mysql and have to rebuild indexes). Despite many arguments with them over what constitutes acceptable use (and, let's face it, what's the point of offering a virtualised server *unless you accept that normal server maintenance will, on occasion, have to take place on individual containers*) there has been no change.

Thus, over time I've moved VPS' away to more reliable providers. The final clincher came today, when I noticed that my last VPSCheap VPS was offline. This is one of their ""high-end"" VPS' that costs me $30/month. I went on to the control panel and tried to boot it, but to no avail. I opened a support ticket to find out if there was anything preventing it from booting.

Ten minutes later they replied to the ticket to tell me that there was a corrupt file system on the node, and my VPS required a reinstall. I emailed back to confirm that there had been full data loss, to which I got a curt reply: ""Yes. Unfortunately all data on the server has been lost.""

I don't have a problem with critical data loss - that's what backups are for. I don't even have much of an issue with the downtime caused by this data loss, the sites hosted on that box failed over (A records updated when the box became inaccessible). What I have an issue with is that there was ZERO proactive response when they *lost all of the data* for multiple VPS'. Not a discount, not a refund, not even a measly apology email. I had to discover it of my own accord, and then only discover it was screwed up after contacting them. That is NOT the way you manage a business and retain clients.

Multiple resources can be delivered in a single http request, so clever hacks that reduce http requests will no longer be necessary...

Also the server can ""push"" multiple files to the client that it knows you will need (and in the order you need them) without having to first:

* send you the html

* let you parse it

* request those files.

Things like this won't be necessary any more:
 
* image sprites (pain to create, pain to update)

* js and css concatenation (page blocks while the css loads, one big file = longer wait)

* inlining your images with data-uri's (actually increases image size by 33%)

* inlining your css on the page (css can't be cached if used elsewhere)

* sharding your resources across multiple domains (wtf)

And honestly, you don't even need to know those things for it to work. You just install the server module and it will start improving your site's performance for supported browsers."	t5_2qs0q	True

Now, this guy charges these people a good deal of money to update and design their site, and he promotes himself as a professional E-Commerce web designer, so he's not just the owners 15 year old son dicking around with Dreamweaver. This guy does this for a living.

He e-mails me back ""just tell me what I need to do to fix this, time is ticking"".

I had to fight the overwhelming urge to explain to him that if you try linking to something that's not there **it doesn't work**, and politely explained he should read the installation docs (which are a whopping 4 steps, half of which are 'connect to FTP &gt; upload the file to *a very specific folder*').

1357294639.0	15y0qj	Advice wanted - I feel like a fraud, but perhaps this is how some of you started out?	raaaargh_stompy	139	20	83	"Via a strange set of events I have ended up spending my days designing a website, but I am not a web developer.

My small company won a contract to work with a very large well known international organization - I was on the team that complete the project, it had nothing to do with web design, more like stats.

I was the only computer literate person in my small company (read typical nerd, self taught computer builder, day to day windows problems fixer with some amateur interest in code (getting PHP to turn your phone number into color swatches etc). As such when a technical component came up in an extension to the bid (design of an online information gathering system) my company asked if I would be willing to write it.

I said it was out of my depth, but it all made sense to me, so I did it, and everyone both sides of the aisle was please with what I did.

Cut to a year later and the large organization essentially requested I turn this concept for data gathering into a large internal tool, gathering data, validating it, storing it in a database and rendering information displays via a user interface...

well I didn't know anything about that, so I have google and stack overflowed my way to trying to keep up, and every time they ask me to do something else my first thought is - 'how the hell do I do that', but I just say 'yeah I can look into ways of doing that, should take about a... week?'

Now I am paid way more than I used to be, designing for this big company who are talking about taking me on directly to oversee the project, asking if it is possible for me to add features... they have always been pleased with what I have made, but oh my god would I be embarrassed if a real web developer ever looked under the hood.

Even now when I look back at the stuff I did early on I facepalm... so I have cobbled together this specific knowledge that does what I need... but I feel all day every day as though I have NO IDEA WHAT I AM DOING.

I come to forums and read /r/webdev and I don't understand most of the words...


I guess I am just wondering if this is a common story, or if I am building myself a house of cards, and one day I am going to end up liaising with an in house web dev guy and he's just going to take a look at my code, look up at me, and my cover will be blown.

Any advice? I've always tried to tell them at every stage that I don't have the requisite qualifications for this, but they keep waving me aside, so I suppose it's slightly their fault.

For what it is worth I love learning about it, I work in PHP  jquery MySQL (PDO), and what I have built seems to work... I am certain that I am doing things in very poor ways sometimes however.


**EDIT:** What a great response from this community - so many supportive and informative answers have given me an inside track on a group of people I didn't really think I could relate to. I had a feeling many people felt in degrees like I do, even those I would think of as code savants - it's great to hear from you about your experiences.

A lot of good advice here as well about places to improve and things to make sure I don't screw up (like security). I''m going to redouble my enthusiasm and get stuck in. Thanks!

1365714834.0	1c5tmj	Two years ago I launched mailnesia.com, here's what happened since	kednaust	132	16	69	"I launched [Mailnesia](http://mailnesia.com), a disposable email service in 2011 as a hobby project and I still actively
develop it.  Features at a glance:

 - Automatically visits registration/activation links in
   emails, completing any registration process instantly
 - Alternate mailbox names (aliases) for extra anonymity, use any name you want
 - Alternative domain names (all mail is accepted regardless of domain name)
 - Displaying HTML emails correctly including attached images, files
 - Multiple encodings supported: Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian etc
 - RSS feed for every mailbox
 - New emails appear as they arrive, without needing to refresh the page
 - Fast, easy to use interface

Since then, the site has been featured ( or was just mentioned ) on
websites such as [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/5847625/mailnesia-is-a-temporary-email-tool-that-automatically-clicks-registration-links),
[Makeuseof](http://www.makeuseof.com/dir/mailnesia-anonymous-disposable-email/) and [Ghacks](http://www.ghacks.net/2012/05/31/the-ultimate-disposable-email-provider-list-2012/).

I'm in perpetual battle with bots scraping the site.  Nginx is rate
limiting excess requests, IP's with continuous rate limiting get
banned automatically with fail2ban.  Opening too many mailboxes
triggers a captcha.  I had to implement reverse DNS checking so excess
RSS requests would only be allowed for Google feedfetcher.

Some statistics:

 - a few hundred thousand daily incoming mail (close to a million, 10GB+): http://mailnesia.com/stats.html
 - Email retention time: few days
 - Tipically there are about 1-2 million emails in the system
 - In the first week of December the site had 173k unique visitors who
   made 357k pageviews (according to Google Analytics) - but that
   doesn't mean anything since 98% of those were bots scraping the
   site (banned since):
   http://blog.mailnesia.com/post/46812952774/chinese-botnet-strikes-again

Architecture:

 - Custom SMTP server implemented in perl.  Event based, using only
   one thread.
 - Perl fastCGI website powered by Nginx web server.
 - Emails are stored in a PostgreSQL database on a 15 GB SSD disk 
 - Hosted on a virtual private server

Future plans under consideration:

 - Multiple editable aliases

I always intuitive middle click the link because that's how (real) links are opened in new tabs/windows. However this sometimes fails.

Instead of just setting the target attribute to ""_blank"" so both left and middle click works, some javascript is used to open the page. and of course this is only triggered by left click, not middle click \*facepalm\*.

Why? Why not just using what's already in html and works?

~~

Also I've seen this on forms. Some forms are supposed to be processed by javascript, not submitted to the server. Often there is no form at all, just some alone inputs, of which one is a button that triggers the javascript that uses the form data.

Isn't it better to use a form element, set its action attribute to something like ""javascript:void(0);"" and the onsubit attribute to the function that uses the data? This makes the form act like forms are supposed to act; pressing enter in most inputs (not textarea since it's multiline) submits the form. Of course all form elements could have an event listener added to them that listens for enter being pressed, but how much ugly, unnecessary code isn't that?

edit: an empty action attribute and having the onsubmit function to return false is better for forms. less code and looks cleaner."	t5_2qs0q	True

A little background: I've been a medical software programmer for the past 5-6 years and am looking to make the jump to web dev. My professional experience is with MEDITECH software, which unfortunately uses a proprietary language, making my skills in that area  not very transferable to something more modern.  

So for the last 6 months I've been learning about web dev on my own through various tutorials and google searches, and have been coding projects that interest me. 

I'm hoping that my self-motivation in learning these skills plus my professional experience in a somewhat-related field will look good to employers.  Thoughts?

Thanks!

[http://studentweb.infotech.monash.edu/~wlay/FIT1012/muse-demo/](http://studentweb.infotech.monash.edu/~wlay/FIT1012/muse-demo/)

And for reference, here's Adobe's original:
[http://muse.adobe.com/](http://muse.adobe.com/)

Last week I did a lecture explaining the advantages of HTML/CSS over older techniques (presentational HTML, table layouts, imagemaps, etc). Adobe's Muse release makes ignores many of the advantages of CSS. All I see is ImageReady for a new generation.

Please take a look and view the source. 105 lines of neatly formatted HTML source. 41 lines of poorly formatted CSS (sorry).

A few notes:

* This is XHTML/CSS2 only (what my students are currently studying). As you can see HTML5 and CSS3 are not necessary for a site like this.
* No JS, though there is basic slideshow nav using HTML/CSS.
* Mostly working in older versions of IE, no browser specific tricks.
* Tried to keep content is good source order.
* Most of the measurements/color/type was just eyeballed. Some it may be a little different to Adobe's original.
* Relies on the Segoe UI family of fonts. Otherwise defaults to sans-serif and looks a little worse.

Ideas for further improvement/optimization are most welcome."	t5_2qs0q	True

Not-original	158	55	19	"The huge printing presses of a major Chicago newspaper began to malfunction on the Saturday before Christmas, putting all the revenue for advertising that was to appear in the Sunday paper in jeopardy. None of the technicians could track down the problem. Finally, the manager made a frantic call to a retired printer who had worked with these presses for over 40 years. ""We'll pay anything; just come in and fix them,"" he was told.

When he arrived, he walked around for a few minutes, surveying the presses. Then he approached one of the control panel and opened it. He removed a dime from his pocket, turned a screw 1/4 of a turn, and said, ""The presses will now work correctly."" After the manager thanked the old printer profusely, he told him to submit a bill for his work.

The bill arrived a few days later, for $10,000.00! Not wanting to pay such a huge amount for so little work, the manager told the old printer to please itemize his charges, with the hope that he would reduce the amount once he had to identify how little he had done. 

The revised bill arrived: 
$1.00 for turning the screw; 
$9,999.00 for knowing which screw to turn.

Anyways, [let me know what you think](http://www.etpost.com/moo/index.php) (&lt;---I reiterate, NSFW!) and/or if you come across any bugs. I hope to launch it next week =D 

Thanks for your time.

**Update:** Lots of great feedback. I just completed some more optimization with preloading images and such... thanks for the eyes, /r/webdev :) Coming soon, per request:

- displayable info box for pic data (title, link back, actual link)
- saving user settings via html5 localStorage... (slider speed, always load last visited sub)
- a more fluid gallery transition (people wanna see some jquery animation. I don't blame em.. )

I think it's bearable now though at least. 

____
**Update 2:** Speed is up, cache is controlled better. Mostly great suggestions from everyone. I'll continue to make changes throughout the weekend, and will announce the launch later. Site will stay up for testing where it is now. If it breaks at this point, it's probably because I'm working on it and it should be back up within a few minutes.

Being read-only, you cannot vote, comment, submit or anything that requires user auth, but you can save your customized subreddits list locally (through localStorage), and you can create 'Channels', that can group up to 3 subreddits.

I basically used .json at the end of the regular reddit.com's URLs for pulling the data, and built the interface around that, starting from the mobile layout and growing from that, all the way to the layout for tablets and desktops.

If I get enough feedback, I will definitely add user auth, maybe with Heroku, for being able to vote and comment.

So what does r/webdev think of Reeddit? any feedback is welcome and appreciated. :)

1328208240.0	p80pu	Darkstrap.css: A simple dark theme for Twitter Bootstrap 2.0	danneu	107	14	33	"If the default Twitter Bootstrap is too clean and binky-bonky for you, I wrote a simple stylesheet that you can load after bootstrap.css that will turn the lights down.

* Here's a live demo: http://danneu.com/darkstrap/darkstrap.html
* Here's what Twitter Bootstrap 2.0 actually is, while we're at it: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/

I'm actually developing a dark-themed project but the default Bootstrap wasn't giving me the vibes I wanted during development. I couldn't get into the Grunge Zone. So I made this and I'll continue updating/tweaking it since my own project just builds on top of it.

It's just a bunch of color, border, and box-shadow tweaks. Some directly taken from the beautiful Compass' docs.

### Update

Thanks for the feedback. 

I'll push up some tweaks to it tonight, especially those offered in the comments. For example, it doesn't support some Bootstrap features like modal popups, as someone pointed out. The input fields are blindingly white. And more.

I'll also try to make it more friend to developers, like clean up the SCSS.

### Update 2

I wasn't sure if anyone would care about this project, so the project was incomplete. Stuff like tab navigation and really anything not on the demo page wasn't darkened.

Well, I'm pushing up some updates tonight that are so extensive that I feel sorry for anyone that's been using darkstrap.css before this point.

### Update 3

Made a big push just now that fills up the demo with all the Bootstrap examples and ensures they all work. I didn't really know what color to make the input fields, and I need to tweak some colors.

But it isn't what I was hoping?		114	17	132	"So, I've been working for a very trendy web development company for 3 months now and I love the work we do and the people here, but there is something that has disappointed me. In the interview, I said I wanted my coding skills to be expanded, I wanted to learn Zend and new technologies, and they where all over me and hired me on the spot!

I am on a team with 3 other developers, but so far haven't even touched a line of PHP. This is because all the websites are made in Drupal or Wordpress, which I am now a pro at despite having never used them before. Honestly, I am amazed by how powerful it is for creating dynamic websites easily. Yet, I feel dissatisfied that I haven't actually done any coding! It seems that anytime we reach a problem that might require a custom module, we find a workaround using existing modules instead - doh!

I want to be logical and honest, I can build a website in Drupal in 10% of the time it would take me to develop it using a framework, so why the heck should I be coding PHP? I've started to question the very basis of learning PHP in the first place. What is the job of a PHP web developer nowadays? Is this what I should have expected?

I don't want to sound ungrateful as I know many people would do anything for a job, but I am just curious to learn more about the industry and what our job roles imply in terms of actual PHP development."	t5_2qs0q	True

Do you have any good post or article explaining how companies that build large web applications with a large team of developers (i think of FB, Twitter, Google, but also smaller companies like Spotify, ...) make all their developers work together in terms of :

- unit testing
- source version control
- definition of software components, and how they are re-used among teams ?
- factorization of resources for styling (css, icons, sprites)... I think of Twitter there because of their Twitter Bootstrap f/w
- QA
- deployment of production
- etc ...

I am especially interested in articles explaining how __large__ teams work together, i know how to build a medium-sized web app with a dozen of developers (say like a small Tumblr), but i wonder how large companies manage to make hundreds or thousands of developers all together...

FYI, here are some tools i know very well : AMD, Jasmine, Karma, Backbone, Angular, JS, CSS3, HTML5, ...

Thank you for your replies !

I meet up with a potential client tomorrow, and from the phone conversation i'm getting the idea that she tries to build some sort of ""all in one social media sharing dating platform"".

let me outline what i have gotten for the consersation so far:

the good:

- wants to use an existing cms that already supports some sharing options

the bad:

- after emails and telephone calls i still dont have any idea of the purpose of the website. On the screnshots i see classifields, a directory, a blog(?), ads, and apparently there will be communities.

- didnt consult any designer; mockups look like websites from 10 years ago. No animated gifs; but just plain boring to put it nicely. pretty much like this:

    p {
    	background-color:black;
    	color:aqua;
    }
    
    h1, h2, h3, h4 {
    	background-color:aqua;
    	color:black;
    }

- the signup form is (i'm not making this up!) 7 screens long.

At this point, it looks like i have to write at least code and design a db for the horrible signup form, and from the looks of it this will be a lot of work, and i dont really see how this site would draw some interrest with no clear goal and a terrible conversation rate because the signup form is worse than doing your taxes.

What would be your advice of handeling this? I would like to do work and get paid; but the idea of spending time on a site that will never really take off seems like a waste of time and talent. However, i also dont want to come across as ""your idea sucks, do it my way""."	t5_2qs0q	True

The problem, for some time, is that I've been trying to use this subreddit as a professional resource for an experienced web developer. Oftentimes it delivers; it lets me know when there's a new version of a popular library or IDE, occasionally I get a good debate comparing tools, and so on. The problem is that this seems to makes up like 5-10% of the popular content. The rest is extremely basic technical questions, extremely basic business questions, people sharing their projects, or people sharing amusing/frustrating anecdotes. The atmosphere in here is very much ""r/introtowebdev"" or ""r/webdevwatercoolerchat"".

One of my clients asked me if I could meet with one of his friends, who calls himself a ""SEO expert"", allegedly has a lot of clients and references etc. He should give me some tips about the website I made for him (which is doing very nicely btw). I thought why not, maybe I could learn something new, so I agreed.

Well, I DID learn something, but completely different that I thought. The first this expert told me was ""you need to add meta keywords tag and fill it with all the relevant keywords, this will improve your ranking in all major search engines a LOT"". At this moment, I am like WTF. His second tip is not bad either - ""make a lot of MFA-like sites and put links all over them, pointing on the main site"". I said nothing and just opened Google Analytics with stats from this site (and this site is doing GREAT at the moment). He just stands here in an awkward silence and I ask him - ""do you think this site needs any of the bullshit you just said?"". He said ""sorry to bother you"" and left. That shit was awesome :)

The point is, I am not mad that these people exist - but maybe we should educate our clients more so they stop throwing absurd money on these clowns. I mean, I am by no means expert on SEO, I just know the basics and needless to say, my websites have very solid ranks for some competitive terms. Later that day I met with the client and he asked me how it went. I said, ""just don't listen to anything this guy is telling you"". 

TL;DR - I hate these so-called ""SEO experts"". Honestly, if you think you are one, you probably aren't (with honor to actual exceptions!).

I have screenshots and so forth, everything is documented. What should I do? What have you done in these cases? It's almost been a month, I assume I've lost this payment.

Needless to say, I had plans for that money for my family during Christmas, which obviously will all be frustrated. 

What would you do in my place? Thanks in advance for your advice.

- multiple files at once
- resumable
- source on GitHub

Details in the FAQ section

It's very handy when the user is uploading a large file, and accidentally disconnects, or don't have time to wait, or have to close his browser, etc...

Because we slice up the files, low memory usage is guaranteed. Theoretically you can upload even GB-s of data with this technique.. without change the limits in php.ini


EDIT: As other commenters wrote, you can find other implementations, too: 

- https://github.com/23/Resumable.js
  Don't tested..but it seems you can use this code right away, like a plugin.. anyway seems promising:)

- I found another implementation which is (it seems) a part of a jQuery plugin, I don't know if it's working or not..: 
https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload

Please try out these, too.

First compliment I've gotten from my boss in over a year.	forgotten_legacy	115	33	57	"Here's a screenshot of it: http://i.imgur.com/mj9Xa.png — At work it runs in it's own independent window (Chrome's ""Create Shortcut"" deal), but that doesn't work on my Mac at home.

I work in the precious metals wholesale business. We have 5 traders buying and selling all day long. We hedge our purchases on the COMEX exchange in NY. Every time we are long or short 100oz gold, or 5,000oz silver, our boss sells or buys a contract respectively.

Up until now, every time a trader made a purchase or sale, they would yell over to the boss how much they did, and he would keep tally on a piece of scratch paper. It was terrifyingly archaic.

I threw this app together in 5 hours flat. It simply lets the traders enter their trades into the computer and keeps it all tallied electronically. Every time we get long/short 100g/5000s, a horrid alarm goes off on the bosses machine (or anyone who has alerts on), letting him know he needs to buy/sell a contract.

He loved the demo I pitched to him and we did a trial run today. It was an amazing feeling being able to set this up on all the traders computers and watch them so easily learn something you built. Since I'm a hobbyist developer and have never deployed anything to the public, it was the first time I got to see/feel that.

**THE CODE BEHIND IT:** I tried using Node.js, but it was a huge fucking pain, so I hunted around and found [PHP Websocket Server](http://code.google.com/p/php-websocket-server/), which is what I used for the server.

I wanted to keep this as barebones as possible, so it stores the values in a .txt file in case of a server crash, and also logs each trade in a .txt for archival purposes.

The frontend is all HTML/CSS/JS, with FancyWebSocket for handling the Websocket stuff.

Just wanted to share this. It's been an awesome day, besides the extra 3 hours I spent at work today rectifying a $190k mistake I made. :O"	t5_2qs0q	True

Did designers got lazy? I don't think so. I do think that some programmers  found a way to cut costs by using and abusing that framework for every single website they develop.

I recently have been forced to use a screen reader, and have encountered my fair share of accessibility issues.

This experience has only been a few days for me, so a lot of the problems could be due to my inexperience or the specific application I am using.

I'll spare you the details, but as of 6 days ago I discovered that using my eyes caused me enormous pain and nausea.  A friend reminded me of screen readers, but I was like, ""I can't even use my eyes to FIND a screen reader!""  He looked around and discovered that OSX has a screen reader (called ""VoiceOver"") built in, and fortunately, I have access to a Mac! (Orca blows chunks)  Yay!  I started using it 4 days ago.

I can't use the screen reader for everything. Even navigating around the OS is difficult, and I keep getting ""stuck"" in areas or just plain old lost. Yuck.  But websites? Most are a word soup.  I am able to actually see, so in those cases I can just open my eyes and see what's going on... _but it hurts!_ 

The absolute number 1 priority to me right now when trying to screen read a website are the headers.  Please please please, have proper, logical headers, not too much, and not too little, in a logical order, with very clear and understandable meaning.  These headers are how I ""skim"" the page and ""see"" what is there, and allow me to jump to an area I want to read.

FYI, I'm seeing all kinds of doctors.  Still trying to figure out what is wrong with me."	t5_2qs0q	True

1362619570.0	19tcn4	I'm a 20 year old web developer and just landed a full-time development position for $75k/year with benefits. Here is how!	theyoungdev	123	47	137	"Hey guys, I just landed my first real job, full-time. I was in University for Computer Science and dropped out when I realized I love programming on my own, learning the things I want to learn, instead of mundane assignments at school. Don't get me wrong, it's a personal thing, if I don't want to do something, there is no way in the world I was going to do it and assignments/homework were one of those things. School stuff was extremely interesting and I loved it, but deep down I just wanted to do what I wanted to do. I mainly dropped out because ~50% of the course material didn't directly relate to web development. 
  
What I did:  
  
**1. Join communities**  
  
Join online communities. Talk to people, help people with things, make connections. I'm part of loads of web development forums. Stackoverflow, /r/webdev and related, sitepoint, digitalpoint, google groups, facebook groups, whatever community that is related to your niche. In my case, PHP. I helped a lot of people online with various scripts and relatively simple programming problems. This exposed me to many different languages, frameworks, and platforms. Once in awhile I'd get an email or private message asking to help on an assignment with pay offered, which I gladly did. I also made quite a few contacts which I then had on facebook/twitter/steam/AIM/what have you. I frequented development IRC channels, there are thousands of them, talk to people.
 
**2. I learned anything and everything I could**   
  
I originally started tinkering with web development when I was 14. I helped people install and run small PHP scripts to monitor their private game server online/offline status, eventually making logos and full website designs, and then moving onto html/css and javascript, then PHP. After two years of tinkering, I eventually charged people for these things and that gave me lots of experience.  
  
I used websites such as codecademy.com, coursera, udacity, MIT open courseware, and various other resources. I think the best resource I could ever recommend would be tutsplus. I signed up for a membership and went through their courses on jQuery, MySQL, PHP, different frameworks such as codeigniter, cakePHP, etc.  
  
**3. Keep with the scene**  
  
This kind of ties into point 1. Read blogs of famous developers, watch screencasts, listen to podcasts, video blogs, blogs. I follow a lot of famous web developers and startups on twitter/facebook. Usually they will link interesting articles, resources, and news. This allows you to be exposed to the latest technologies. This is actually how I found out about things like nodeJS, ruby, python, and various other languages/frameworks. 
  
**4. BUILD THINGS**  
  
You can skip points 1-3, those are all fairly common knowledge. Essentially keep up with the scene. The biggest thing however is building things. I had about a year off living with my parents, every week I would work on something. On one week I may have said to myself ""Hmm, I don't know Python, but I want to build something with it"". Since I was super into Counter-Strike, I build add-ons compatible with eventscripts that were written in Python. I wrote various server plugins and gamemodes compatible with eventscripts. Every week/month/however long a project took, I would try a new technology, a new language, a new framework. Something I haven't previously built anything with, but read a lot about and been exposed to.  
  
Due to this I have experience in a variety of different things.
  
**5. Network (probably the biggest key)**  
  
I happen to be fortunate, I live in a large city on the east coast, and around here there are lots of things like hackathons, code collaborations, code groups. I went to all of it. I went to every hackathon I could find such as this: https://www.facebook.com/hackathon which I could afford from random freelance work. I went to school hosted hackathons and presentations. About once a week we would have someone on campus giving a talk about something or hosting an event. Some talks I went to were related to: open source development, raspberry pi club, linux talks, linux clubs, robotics clubs. Whenever I saw someone that was interesting, or anyone that intrigued me for that matter, I would walk up to them and introduce myself and just talk. I'd then give them a business card or write down my info to keep in touch, and they did. I have tons of ""friends"" on FB that I still keep in contact with and share things with.   
  
**6. Develop an online presence**   
  
Personal portfolio. Github. Facebook. LinkedIn. Twitter. Whatever else. I created an online persona, linked it all to social media, and got my name out there. Any little tool or app or piece of code I made I posted on my Github, tweeted it at various people, emailed people for feedback, and posted online.  
  
**7. Resume**    
  
With my resume, I listed any and every technology I ever did work with. I had server experience, lots of relevant course work, a PLETHORA of projects, my own domain, social media, github. This was all on my resume. I have all my languages that I have ever used. I divided this into four groups: Proficient, Exposed to, Currently leaning, Can spell (for humor, interviewer found it quite funny). Anything I have ever touched was on my resume. Keep in mind though, if you just read about some new technology, that doesn't exactly merit resume worthiness, not by a long shot. Have SOMETHING developed in it.  

ALWAYS TAILOR YOUR RESUME AND COVER LETTER TO THAT SPECIFIC POSITION. Personalize it, this helped me land handfuls of interviews SO EASILY. Another thing people loved was that I answered emails/tweets/messages INSTANTLY (fb/gmail/twitter).  
  
------------------------------------------------
  
The biggest tip I have is to not be overwhelmed. For a few months I was stuck in this little loop where I would always be afraid to develop something because I was too overwhelmed by the complexity of the technology and I felt like I always didn't know enough. The easiest thing I found was just to solve a problem. For example: I couldn't delete all the comments on one of my reddit accounts in an easy way, so I wrote a simple JS script to do it and threw it on my github. I wanted to learn CSS3 and HTML5, made a little alarm clock app that when counted down fully, would send me an email. Things like that.  
  
Don't be afraid to meet people, give them your info, do a bit of personal advertising. It's how I met people and it's how I essentially got my job.  
  
Don't think I was some genius programmer who spent night and day on the computer coding since I was 14. I wasn't. I only really started taking it seriously about two years ago, I'd say all previous experience was just being exposed to the scene, I didn't even *think* that this would be my career way back when I was doing this stuff. Again, I really started getting into it when I was 18, so only really two years."	t5_2qs0q	True

For instance, do those of you who work as full-time fontend or backend developers spend a lot of time referring to API docs and code examples as you work on new projects, or do you know the languages well enough to code a page without referring to anything? I ask because I think it will be important for me to study according to what's expected and refrain from moving on to something new until I have mastered the current topic. As it stands, I move between topics so quickly that it's difficult to retain a large part of the specific information I learn."	t5_2qs0q	True

I'm one of a two Java programmers working on a complex legacy codebase in a predominantly Ruby engineering group, headed up by a passionate Rubyist CTO. I've come from a mainstream corporate environment, and was hired because I know Java well and reworking the code to Ruby is impractical.

The prevailing opinion of the Ruby team is that Java is, essentially, an abomination that should be utterly eradicated from the face of the Earth.

Now whether you believe that or not, I'm surprised at the level of hatred and I'd like to understand where it comes from. Personally speaking I've always been interested in solving interesting problems using IT rather than being passionate about technology per-se; also I think that it's just good engineering practice to take a balanced approach to building systems, rather than letting personal preference colour my decision making. 

Currently, my main theory is that it's because of Java's percieved language shortcomings compared to Ruby, the fact that it's controlled by Oracle (and historically Sun), plus the fact that it's so mainstream and thus an obvious target.

Any thoughts? Please be constructive ... I hear plenty of ""OMG KILL JAVA LOL"" so I'm hoping to cut through the bullshit. 

**TL;DR:** All my Ruby colleagues vehemently hate Java. As an engineer interested in solving real world problems rather than particular technology choices, I don't understand why and would like to.

I'm only about five years in the field, but I've been pretty successful. I certainly can discuss my credentials if you wish, but that's not what I want to dwell on.

1. College degrees are far from a requirement. Development and in particular web development is very much a meritocracy: those who are good do well and those who don't sink. As someone who has done hiring, I looked more favorably on one year of professional web development than any four year degree. A degree *will* help get you interviews but little more than that. I am not at all implying degrees are not helpful, particularly if you want to do some of the more specialized types of applications like natural language processing, machine learning, or Bayesian analysis. Even then, with some spare time and a desire to learn you can do those too.
2. A good place to start is HTML and CSS. Too many web devs can't do CSS worth a damn. Both of them are pretty easy to wrap your mind around and pretty essential in my opinion. After getting a firm grasp, then I'd move to more server-side learning. I personally started in PHP and was happy to have done so. I think it's among the easiest to pick up. As far as a first database, I'd say start with MySQL. You'd be hard pressed to find any major app that doesn't use MySQL in at least some minor way. Be sure not to neglect JavaScript either. One of my former colleagues made a very astute observation that knowing JavaScript will likely make you the most money. First because no matter the back-end language, you're always going to be using JavaScript on the front-end and with node.js occasionally on the back-end. And secondly, they're just aren't as many good JS devs as there are jobs for them.
3. Keep your LinkedIn up to date. I can't tell you how many awesome opportunities I've gotten because of this. It's not just Joe's Dev Shack in Timbuktu that's calling (though he does call), but cool new start-ups and cool tech-giants calling too. I've interviewed with Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Tesla Motor Company, SpaceX, Amazon, and some other really cool companies. Where did they all find me? LinkedIn. Every time.
4. Going back to experience, open-source work does indeed substitute for real job experience. I'm not great at this because I don't contribute regularly to any particular open-source project, but I have hired based on it. Contract work (as in small, one-off jobs for Consuela's Maid Service made in Wordpress in a week) does not substitute. I rarely bring those up, if ever, in a professional interview.
5. Look for internships if you can't get a junior position. Maybe the pay isn't great, but the experience and the résumé material is far, far more valuable than any sum of money they could offer you.
6. When you do get hired somewhere, find somewhere where there is a deficiency of knowledge and become an expert in it. At one of my companies, we were going forward with the idea of using MongoDB as the database. The issue was that none of the devs had any experience using it. These are opportunities to make yourself indispensable to your company. I went on a weekend coding bender and built an entire app using MongoDB and by the end I was pretty proficient at it. By the end of my tenure with the company, I was still known as the MongoDB guy.
7. Keep up to date on new technologies. Occasionally have a weekend when you lock yourself in a room and build a whole new app just to learn a new technology. When I got one of my jobs, I didn't know the back-end language of what was being used there. However, the weekend previous I had just gone on a node.js bender (despite the fact that it really had little to do with the then-present job.) That fact that I showed I picked up on a new language over a weekend was enough to convince him that I would have little issue working in a new language. In extension, always be tinkering on your own. I've had so many positive experiences that way and learned a lot. Apps don't have to make you money. If you learn something while making it, that's an investment that will pay off later.

That's all I got off the top of my head. From the other grizzled dev-veterans, what tips can you offer to have a successful career in web development? What do you wish you had known beforehand?

1323634431.0	n8qwq	Guys, we need to talk about security.	damontoo	109	41	58	"So in another thread yesterday, someone posted [a comment asking why anyone would use NoScript](http://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/n7p0j/why_why_why_do_you_guys_serve_content_from/c36wlpx). The reply thread that followed was full of WTF and demonstrated a lack of understanding of some key issues relating to javascript and browser security.

Many of the people that commented in that thread basically had the position that javascript is required for modern web browsing and that anyone running NoScript is some kind of paranoid nutcase. I feel like it's very important to set the record straight.

What is the purpose of NoScript?

NoScript is *not* meant to be a replacement for ad blockers (though it can certainly function like that). It's meant as a tool to whitelist sites so that they can run javascript while others cannot.

But why would you want to block javascript?

**XSS**, **XSS**, and also **XSS**. Did I mention **XSS**?

XSS allows an attacker to execute an arbitrary javascript payload under the targeted domain. 

This means they can access the DOM of preference pages to steal user data, steal cookies (if not declared as HTTP only), set cookies, submit forms, create custom forms that trick the user into sending data to the attacker etc.

Take the following scenario -

Hans the hacker ( I just made this up right now. :O ) has discovered a reflected XSS hole in bestbuy.com. He crafts a link that injects his script into an HDTV product page.

What does the script do?

* Changes the TV price from $2999 to $100
* Creates a message that says there's only 50 TV's left in stock.
* Creates a message that the mega discount promotion will expire in 1 hour.
* Replaces all add to cart and purchase buttons with his own buttons.

When you click the purchase button the script crafts what looks like the Best Buy checkout page. This can even be delayed slightly to simulate page load. The form requests your name, billing address, CC details etc. When you submit, it sends all your data to the attacker and presents you with an order confirmation page explaining that due to very high order volume, please wait up to 24 hours for a confirmation email.

Hans then submits the link to r/technology with a clever title to build hype. People see there's not much stock/time left so they rush to order. Someone eventually comments that it's an attack and to not follow the link, but it's too late.

*That* is a scenario NoScript protects you against. 


I am not a security professional. I find and report XSS holes as a hobby. That's why it troubles me to see comments like those I saw yesterday. It shows that some web devs, those on the front lines of web app security, are apparently clueless about how prevalent XSS problems are. These are people tasked with ensuring user supplied data is properly sanitized, yet can't understand why anyone would use a white-list policy for javascript.

For more posts about browser security by people much more qualified than myself -

[r/netsec](http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec)

[r/xss](http://www.reddit.com/r/xss)

**tl;dr** - Allowing arbitrary javascript from untrusted domains by default can be dangerous. Also, NoScript includes XSS, clickjacking, and CSRF protections. Please don't spread the message that javascript is always harmless. It's not.

I am always amazed by the canvas and WebGL demos that are posted online, but in terms of practicality in a professional environment, is it worth learning? Those 3D / mathy / artistic scripts blow my mind, but even in a simpler context, would canvas be worth learning?

DaRKoN_	96	29	83	"One of the drawbacks frequently mentioned on r/webdev to developing on Windows is the crappy CLI - cmd.exe is constantly lamented for being absolute crap and miles behind the \*nix CLI. And it's entirely true, **cmd.exe sucks**. However cmd.exe was superseded back in 2006, and it seems few people on Windows have realised this and moved on to the greener pastures.

Powershell is its replacement and it's vastly different from many other CLI variants. It takes some learning but if you're developing on Windows, you owe it to yourself to spend some time to come to grips with it.

The key difference is that Powershell passes _objects_ through it's pipeline, not strings. The benefit to this is that you typically never have to parse the results of a pipelined operation to get  what you need.

Commands have a strict naming convention laid out in a {verb}-{noun} format, which means PS initially looks _really_ verbose - but all common commands have shorter aliases (and you can of course create your own). 

Almost all the typical *nix commands are already aliased to do the same thing in Powershell. mv, ls, cat, ps, kill, man etc. The main difference is grep, which is 'sls' (select-string).

Powershell has access to the .Net framework meaning if there's something that isn't handled directly via Powershell commands, you can reach into .Net and grab the parts you need. It also means you can leverage 3rd party .Net libraries too. 

There's a mini IDE included in the box - with PowershellISE

Tools to checkout:

 * PoshGit (or PoshHG) - expands your prompt (among other features) to include details of the current Git (or Hg) repo:
	https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git

 * Chocolately - http://chocolatey.org/ a Package Manager built with Powershell and Nuget.

 * Powershell itself can be hosted in a number of different environments - the default is based on the old school command host - it's crap, grab yourself a copy of Console2 and host Powershell via that.

 * PowerTab vastly improves that the completion: http://powertab.codeplex.com

Microsoft themselves are headed further in this direction - Virtually the entire Server 2012 platform can be configured directly via Powershell.

The Azure platform - likewise, can be entirely configured via Powershell.

    New-AzureWebsite SomeCoolSite -github accountName\repo

Will create a new website, and link it to a Github repo and automatically deploy updates made to the master branch.

There's stacks more in the box, like remoting, background jobs, workflows...

TL;DR - Powershell, whilst different, is super powerful and can be a huge boon to your developer toolkit if you're on Windows."	t5_2qs0q	True

1374867996.0	1j485e	Why is Codecademy so heavily criticized?	demeuron	79	21	72	"So I decided to get into coding/web development and try to learn (and eventually master) the skills required to be a Front-End developer. I have a passion for graphic design and enjoy the logic-based thinking in programming, so when I gave it a shot, I wasn't too surprised that this type of thinking clicked with me. 

I'm currently using Codecademy to learn the foundation required to start making basic things and then teach myself the rest of the way. So far I really enjoy the program and have been learning a ton of stuff. I spend on average about 20 hours a week (for a week so far) doing lessons and trying to apply them on my own.

However, reddit seems to be uniformly opposed to Codecademy for a particular reason, saying that it only teaches you 1% of what a programmer knows, that it teaches you irrelevant things or that it teaches you bad practices.

All these negative comments (not just on reddit) make me feel like Codecademy is a waste of time if I want to break into the world of web development. 

When I began this, I never expected Codecademy to teach me everything I should know, but instead that I will teach myself more advanced things as I begin to apply the skills I've learned there, such as proper practices, how to prevent/find errors in my code, and how to organize it in a practical space saving way that will allow other programmers to understand where I left off in my code etc etc. I also have a few mentors who are computer programmers that are willing to help me and give  me tips. 

I KNOW the process of me becoming a developer is a long, but rewarding process, and I'm willing to put the legwork for a couple of years in order to be as good as I can. Also, I think my graduate degree and location, as well as design background can give me an edge once I get a lot better at web-dev.

Which goes to my question and also TL;DR:

**TL;DR: Is Codecademy *really* that bad, or are those people expecting too much from it? I'm aware that the process of becoming a novice to expert coder is long and that Im going to have to teach myself a lot that Codecademy doesn't (which I came into this assuming). Am I doing myself a disservice by chosing Codecademy?**

Heck they even try to hit our API on an Ajax call still.  Just to be sure I put a simple string distance algorithm that I use on an S3 server and made the comments in my code indicate it was just a cdn version... sure enough they are pulling the same file.
Obviously a competitor pulling in JavaScript I control gives me some freedom to play with their site.

1338049212.0	u63jt	How does something like Joomla, one of the most popular CMS platforms, get away with all of this?	spacez320	83	28	111	"A little background:  I've been developing in Joomla for about a year at this point at my first out-of-college job.  I graduated with degrees in Systems Engineering and Computer Engineering along with a minor in Math, but web development was always a thing I enjoyed and did on the side.  I usually employed a lot of ""hand-drawn"" solutions to my website or web app requests, but I recognized that this was potentially wasteful and problematic, so I made a few websites in Wordpress, which wasn't that bad.

Since beginning to work in Joomla, I'm really quite amazed how it can be considered one of the ""best"" CMS solutions available, and I can't figure out why so many people decide to use it.

Here are some complaints.  In soap-boxing this, maybe I can be put in my place and figure out a good way to continue to preserve my sanity in my current job:

* **Documentation** -- What. The. Hell.  The documentation for developing in Joomla is *extremely* lacking.  The official Joomla API site just lists functions and shows you the code for those functions.  That doesn't tell me anything!  

The Joomla Documentation wiki looks like it was written by a bunch of angry software engineers that are begrudgingly telling you how their system works, but not giving you enough detail for you to really understand what's going on.  There are some function and class explanations on the wiki, but not many, and most explanations look like they're written more for the dev team than someone trying to put together a website.

To quote the great Louis Black, ""Are you trying to keep this shit a secret?!""

* **Routing** -- Routing in Joomla is an absolute joke.  You can give certain things like articles and menu destinations ""aliases,"" but it seems to be directly tied to Joomla's caching system (which is also a bad joke).  If you make a menu item, but you don't want it to be an *actual* menu item, there seems to be no real way to get to it by putting in a URL. 

 Making test pages for components or modules seems near impossible.  I've been forced to mirror whole production websites so that I can add some new feature without it showing up on the live site for all the world to see.

* **Configuration** - Ok, so if someone can find me a good  documentation page that explains how to use the configuration file, I will kiss you.  What am I supposed to put for some of these values?  I know that I can just go to the administration section and supposedly change some of these values, but sometimes there isn't a one-to-one correspondence, and I just want to change something in the config file to see if something works.  

And another thing, why does changing the error_reporting configuration setting for Jooomla **do nothing** and **shows no errors**?  That might be a site specific thing...but it seems to be the case on stock Joomla installs.

* **Upgrading** -- There is no defined upgrade feature from what I can see.  I haven't had much time to explore 2.5, so I apologize if this was provided in that and I haven't seen it yet, but right now every time I need to ""upgrade a component"" I have to figure out what files were changed or do something drastic like uninstall and re-install.  Bah.

* **Scaling** -- Hooo boy.  I've seen Joomla sites that were nothing but text and images, using the stock Joomla user system and a well developed e-commerce solution (cough VirtueMart cough) go down regularly on shared hosting solutions.  It serves multi-megabyte web-pages.  Before you say anything, I will clarify that even though they are on shared hosting, it **is** the Joomla site that's causing problems, and it's not just one.  There's just no reason for that.

* **Development cycle** -- So let me get this straight.  It took a bazillion years to roll out Joomla 2.5.  And now nearly all of my company's themes, components, and modules won't work anymore?  And you don't really have a good procedure set up for helping me update those?  Cool, thanks for keeping me in the job, Joomla.

* **Third-party additions** -- Seem 90% crap.  Lots of them that I have purchased don't work or make the site 10 times slower at times.  But it's like that for Wordpress too, so whatever, I guess.

This is awfully rantish, but at the same time I'd like it to be a plea.  Am I going about this the wrong way?  Is there some development guide for Joomla that I can't find?  How do other people deal with some of these issues?

**TLDR**; Joomla is stupid and I wish I was using Django instead.

**EDIT** I'm glad this got a lot of response.  People have been addressing many of these points in a really constructive and insightful manner.  While I was afraid this post could have been construed as another big-CMS flame rant, everyone responded positively regardless.  So go team."	t5_2qs0q	True

A little background.  The checkout form assumes that an user that is logged in will have an address.  This isn't the case because an admin can create a user without an address.

The controller for the payment address form doesn't display the radio button to create a new address to a user that is logged in, so there is no way to create a new address.

My pull request defaults the form to creating a new address, unless told that an existing address is being used.

Instead of accepting my pull request, they blame me for not fixing other sloppy code found in the same file.

This project's comment history is full of these two users bashing anyone and everyone trying to help them.

I know which e-commerce solution I won't be using in the future.

**Edit:**  To be fair, I should have cleaned up their code on line 125 as they mention.

**Edit 2:** I've been banned from commenting on my commit, so I will put a reply here.

The main issue with their suggestion of a hidden field on the view is that every single template/theme ever made will require that change.

So, throw an isset() on line 125, keep my changes on 169-171 and you fix it for every theme ever made, not just those that update their templates every time someone finds a bug in your controller.

Another problem with your suggestion is that it still assumes that the form field in question will be set, which, in many cases it won't.  You should always have isset() checks on any array key you plan on accessing.  You blame me for not fixing that on line 125, however, your codebase fails to do isset() or !empty() checks in hundreds of places.

You have zero form validation or error notification for the users.  You should be doing form validation/checking in the controller, not hoping that the view will setup everything correctly.  Users stuck in this bug/loop have no clue why they can't checkout.  You couldn't even locate the bug when it was initially mentioned.

**Edit 3:** [Here is someone else explaining the same exact problem and how to replicate it](https://github.com/opencart/opencart/issues/191), yet Daniel's reply is that there is no problem.  I fully believe my pull request was denied because Daniel didn't believe there was a bug."	t5_2qs0q	True

A short time ago, i decided to try and build an API that would try to guess the gender of a first name. I thought this might be useful for segmenting user lists for campaigning, analytics or similar.

My first approach was to use a dataset of approved names from a few European countries. This was in the believe that most countries had lists like this (Which they don't) and i planned to add them as i went along. I got wiser and the first feedback i got also told me that the API should be able to do probabilistic guesses and if possible, also offer some sort of localization filter to achieve more accurate guesses.

I decided to take an approach of using large, growing datasets of user profiles from social networks. Each entry containing a first name, a gender, a country_id and language_id. At last, i exposed this datamodel through http://genderize.io

It responds in JSON. Simple example: http://api.genderize.io?name=robin

I am now looking to get some feedback on my new approach. What do you think of this way of doing guesses. What do you think of the API? Any feedback is welcome.

The API is completely free by the way."	t5_2qs0q	True

I am currently evaluating a website for a client and his SEO guy insists on using WordPress but I am not really fond of it. I have very limited experience with WP.

The client is really picky concerning the looks of his web page so he has hired someone to design the pages. It means that if we go for WP, I will have to code the templates too.

The WebSite will be around 10-12 static pages and the only thing he really needs from WP is the blog feature. He should be posting once a week.

My question is: Should I convince him to build his website from the ground up and create a custom admin section so he can post on his blog or should I be depending on WP and code all the required template file for WP. (The designer knows nothing about coding, he's only good with PhotoShop).

Is it faster to build from the ground up or is it faster to learn how the templating works in WP. What if his business model changes? Do I have to install plenty of WP plugins or just modifying my code base?"	t5_2qs0q	True

1354975752.0	14hxh3	Looking to break into web development industry - advice?	darrmander	78	22	130	"Hey everyone, 

Thanks for clicking on the link. I graduated with a BA in Political Science this year, and while I was initially considering law school, I've had a change of heart. The market for liberal arts majors is unfriendly at best and instead of being a depressed lawyer with debt, I thought I should at least try to experiment with a skill that is in high demand: programming. It turns out that I love to program and to solve problems, and so I'm keen to enhance this skill while I'm still relatively young (23). 

Specifically, I’m attracted to front-end web development or simply web development in general. I’ve always had a good eye for clean design, though I’ve never had a chance to exercise this with my education. 

I’ve been using many of the available online resources. I’m currently caught-up with CS50x, which is the introductory CS course on edx.org (which teaches C and touches on a few other languages).  I’m about 20% the way through the HTML &amp; CSS, and JavaScript courses on codeacademy.com, and I’ve been learning Python on the side. I’ve heard that Ruby and Ruby on Rails are the go-to languages of the moment, but I’ve yet to look into these.

However, this has only given me a beginner’s acquaintance with a handful languages, and this doesn’t give me nearly enough exposure to begin an entry level position or even an internship in a web development position. How can I accelerate my learning process? I’ve heard of courses such as Dev Bootcamp, which seems great (it’s supposed to land you an entry-level job at the end of 9 weeks), but the cost is prohibitive - $12,000. There are others that exist as well: Starter League in Chicago, Catalyst in San Francisco, and many others. Most of these seem to cost at least $6,000 - $8,000 with varying levels of employment success. If anyone has gone through one of these rapid, exhaustive classes, I’d love to hear from your experience. 

So, my main goal is to gain the necessary skills to be an employable web developer. How can I approach this task in the most logical and efficient way? I’d love to take an internship along the way to get my feet wet. I’m also wondering if web development skills can be exclusively self-taught, or if I should seek some alternative methods (hacker space, etc.)? 

Thanks a lot, /r/webdev, I appreciate it.

tl;dr Graduated with a liberal arts degree, with which finding quality positions is nigh impossible. I love programming, and am looking for good guidance to quickly but carefully gain the necessary web development skills to break into the industry.

Background info: I make 45k, I've been offered salaries at many other companies in the neighborhood of 65k-80k, but declined for various reasons (point being, it's not like I'm being paid a whole lot and there's a whole lot riding on my employment). I'm the sole on-site developer (they hire contractors few and far between, as needed) and I do mostly front-end with plenty of back-end, databases, blogs, CMS, SEO, etc.

I've been thinking lately about taking on some minor side work, here and there. There are opportunities. I live just outside of a major city and 45k isn't nearly enough to live on (as in ""living wage""). I think most people here would agree.

Today my employer asked me to sign an employee agreement, agreeing to (among other things) the following things (sorry for the informality of this list, worked late tonight and I'm beat):

**1) Avoiding Opportunity Conflict** - Any business opportunity (in my field) that comes to my attention is automatically the property of my Employer. Therefore, I must advise my Employer of said opportunity and cannot pursue it myself. (So, if someone approached me about a freelancing opportunity, I'd have to run to my boss and go, ""Boss! Someone just offered me a freelancing opportunity! Want it? Because I'm tooootally not taking it!"")

**2) Insurance** - Loss of me, as an employee, would hurt the company greatly, therefore the Employer can insure my life under a policy of life insurance. I will have to submit, whenever my Employer wants, paperwork that will allow him to obtain said insurance, and submit to any necessary physical examinations (I've heard of this one before, but seriously?).

**3) (Not sure I fully understand this as it may apply to things such as my portfolio, web portfolio, resume, etc.) Confidential Obligations** - ""The Employee agrees that she will have no interest in Confidential Information, including, without limitation, know-how, copyright, trademarks or trade names, notwithstanding that she may have built or contributed to the building of the same."" (What does this mean, exactly?)

**4) Non-solicitation** - I can't solicit or hire away any employees or contractors with whom I have worked since I started working there, from now until 5 years after termination or expiration...... (which kinda sucks because I have been planning on doing something along those lines, no joke).

**5) Non-competition** - I can't be employed through any other means than my Employer without express written consent from now until 5 years after termination or expiration. Same for if I want to even work in the industry. (I think this is ridiculous.)

**6) Termination** - I may be terminated without notice; however, if I decide to quit, I must give them 1 month's notice.

**7)** If anything happens and there's a lawsuit, if I breach the contract, I'm responsible for all of my Employer's legal fees (I have like $200 in my bank account, but ok).

**8) **Also I hereby waive my ""moral rights"" that I may have with regard to the company and its material.

Any advice on whether everything here is reasonable?

**Edit: Thank you so much, everyone, for all your great advice and help. It has helped put this all into perspective. I'm not signing the contract. I'm going to try to have it redrawn, and if that won't happen then I'm going to quit and work elsewhere. Thanks again!**"	t5_2qs0q	True

TheColorMan	81	29	133	"This is probably a stupid question, but I'm a naive high school student so bear with me. Recently when I was applying for an internship I decided to show off what little I know about HTML CSS Javascript by creating a simple website about myself and sending that with my application email. The internship was for a manufacturing company but they said they were impressed by my resume. 

Previously this year my mom, a graphic designer, was whining about how low quality the website that their company's website guy had made. I didn't know much about the big 3 web languages (and still don't) but my brother said it was something he said he could easily make.

Reflecting on these two events, I wonder if it's possible to get a job in web development without a degree. Somebody who probably did have a degree can get a job by making a crummy site, so could somebody like me have no degree but still be able to make a decent, functional site actually have a shot getting a job in this industry?

I haven't applied anywhere and I don't want to have a career in just web dev, I'm just curious (because we high schoolers like summer jobs and getting money).

tl;dr - Guy who probably has degree makes a site for a job that is about as high quality as a site a high schooler can make. From this, could somebody with no official web dev degree still get a job?

Finally I sent the unsubscribe email about 15 times in a row. I figured if a human was behind the scenes, they would be annoyed enough to do something about it. It worked! I got an email back from a real person saying:

&gt; It said to send a one-line message with 'STOP youremailaddress'

&gt; The automated system can read that.
But this is what your message looked like:
--001a11c223f88159c504da0808c8Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1STOP redacted@myemail.com--001a11c223f88159c504da0808c8Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable&lt;div dir=3D""ltr""&gt;&lt;span style=3D""font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:13px=""&gt;STOP=A0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=3D""mailto:redacted@myemail.com"" target=3D""_blank"" style==3D""font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:13px""&gt;redacted@myemail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/=div&gt;--001a11c223f88159c504da0808c8--

&gt; The automated system didn't know what to make of that. So it passed it on to me to read to try to figure out what it was about.

&gt; The trick is to choose 'plain text' formatting whenever you're sending something to an automated system.

I was using gmail and just hit reply. Does the average person even know how to switch to 'plain text mode', let alone when to use it? I think not. I replied saying that a better way is to provide a unique unsubscribe URL. Their reply:

&gt; most people seem to be familiar with listserv-style commands [no they fucking don't]. And even when we tried something like [unique unsubscribe url], they still would reply to the messages sending unsubscribe requests. So this was just an imperfect attempt to take what they were going to do anyway and get some use out of it.

You suck, USGS!

1361498620.0	18ztfz	I'm a junior dev at a startup. The other devs write pretty bad code. Not sure what to do.	dobry_den	61	10	88	"I don't have much of a life, so I spend a considerable amount of my free time learning about object oriented design and contributing to open source projects. I've learned an incredible amount in the past few years.

The other few developers at work are older, have families, and are certainly not coming home from a day at work to invest in educational side-projects and open source contributions. I don't blame them, and I don't blame anyone. Only by being a social derelict do even I have time for that. But my premise is that they are stagnant in their ways.

I've put a lot of effort the past couple years into learning how to write clear code. This job has only confirmed my suspicions that writing code is the easy part of development. Anybody can write code that does anything. In fact, it's downright trivial to write code that does something.

The hard part is writing clear code, especially code that can be changed as requirements change. 

The other (senior) devs write code that's incredibly hard for me to follow.

Nested `if` statements. Monolithic classes that are really just a holding pot for a hundred unrelated functions. Monolithic methods. Untestable code (we don't have a real test suite). Methods that call methods in other files that mutate variables in other files that mutate the results of methods in this file.

Trying to wrap my mind around some code in our codebase involves me busting out pen and paper to track the program's state as I follow branched logic down a hole of a dozen different contexts. A single method will touch the database, check/invalidate cache, and hit the Youtube API all in one go. I spend 15-30 minutes of setup in the console just trying to lay the right dominoes to debug one method call.

This has taken a substantial toll on me lately as I approach burnout with our own product/codebase.

This is my first job and I don't know what to do about this. I don't have the chutzpah to sit down with the lead developer and explain that his code is hard to follow. I don't even know how one could do that without causing grief. 

How can I turn things around?

However, sometimes customers want to pay me and want me to host/maintain the application for them. I usually purchase a web hosting and run a basic monitoring service. 

However, sometimes we develop big sized applications which our customers really serious about. We usually order a dedicated server for those customers, make necessary configurations and host the application.

The thing is, I have no idea how to calculate what kind of server spec requirements we need. I have no idea if it's going to handle 100 concurrent users, or 1.000, or 10.000. Laravel's profiler shows we use around 4.0MB memory on each request. Does it mean we need around 4GB ram for 1000 concurrent users, or more since people usually refresh pages every few seconds? Then, what about CPU?

I would appreciate it if someone can explain it like explaining to a 5 years old. I just want to be sure, if one day my customers gets a heavier load than we expect, I want to report them what has to be done. Not something like ""Let's move to a better server."", instead; ""We need around 4GB more ram to handle current load.""

Ps. I'm not talking about finding bottlenecks since it's a different story. Just want to determine what kind of specs we need for X amount of concurrent users in application's *current state*, and how do you guys calculate the requirements.

Ps. I use Laravel 4 framework and develop using PHP. Applications do mostly crud work (around 15 light queries to generate each page), with a little image manipulation (cropping uploaded images, generating thumbs at runtime and caching them, adding watermarks). "	t5_2qs0q	True

She was dismayed when I ballparked the cost at ""more than $50,000"".  Yeah, a lot more...

Another potential lead, an old duffer probably in his 80's, wanted a site to market his zero-energy automobile.  As he described it, 

*""The generators at the rear wheels power batteries that run motors at the front wheels.  The rear generators are more efficient than the front, so it'll work!""*

I googled ""Perpetual Motion Machine"" in front of him and give him a lesson in basic physics.  When he couldn't wrap his head around that, I had to inform him that I could not put my name to a site that defied the laws of physics and that he would have to look elsewhere.

He doesn't know about OOP practices or design patterns, or even pretty basic string and array functions (in PHP).

People seem to have the impression that git and Github go hand in hand. They don't. You have to use git to use Github, you do not have to use Github or any other similar service to use git. 

Using git can be as simple as typing ""git init"" in the directory you wish to put under version control. You can then commit, branch, tag, and use a large percentage of git commands in that single directory. If you wish to use the collaborative features, all you need is a ssh accessible machine. (or one of the other network protocols git supports, including it's own) 

Please don't let the fact that Github doesn't work for you scare you away from git, or any other VCS.

I recently became employed at a local web dev firm. There are 3 programmers;

- Me, ~2-3yrs experience, mostly PHP

- Co-worker 1, 5yrs experience, mostly PHP

- Co-worker 2, 10yrs experience, mostly PHP

*ALL* of our programming is done via flat PHP. No frameworks, no design patterns, nothing. 

- Co-worker 2 ""doesn't trust outside code"". He has some social / mental disorders I'm fairly sure, because he's extremely rude and *refuses* to do any work as a team with myself and Co-worker 1. He's more or less a lost cause and **absolutely downtright refuses** to believe that using an MVC design pattern could save time + make our applications better, more robust, and faster. As I said, I'm not really worried about this guy - he's totally a lost cause. There's no way we'll ever convince him of anything.

- Co-worker 1, however, is my age and I am trying to convince him that MVC, and freely available frameworks, are **industry standard** at this point. I'm trying to convince him that we're shooting ourselves in the foot and coming off as extremely amateur by refusing to accept any ""outside code"". 

I got him to do the CodeIgniter tutorial at which point his reply was ""I had to use like 8 files and a confusing architecture just for a Hello World app, how exactly is this better than flat PHP?"". I tried to explain to him that when you look at it in the context of attempting to do something simple, obviously it seems like overkill, but that there is a major benefit in the long run in terms of how quickly you can get a prototype up and running VS doing it in flat PHP. Not to mention all the boilerplate crap that is covered for you - form validation, object-relational mapping, etc...

But he simply **refuses** to believe that I'm right, and thinks his flatPHP &gt; anything out there.

He also is ignoring the industry. I'm someone who really, really cares about web development; my 9-5 job is web development, and most of my evenings are spent coding in my spare time / reading up on industry trends and news, and learning new frameworks. 

It's painfully obvious that MVC is, right now, fairly standard - and that industry professionals with TEN TIMES more experience than co-worker 1 or 2 say its better than flatPHP. 

That **alone** should be enough... thousands of people who are more experienced than anybody at our company are very clearly stating, ""Flat PHP is bad compared to MVC + frameworks. Don't reinvent the wheel."".

I now realize that this is largely just a rant and that I might not be able to change my co-workers minds. 

I am someone who cares about doing things the right way. The most efficient way. The safest way. The most productive way. The way that will provide the least amount of headaches later on. The way that makes me get products out the door in the fastest way possible (while still maintaining quality). Because I have these traits, I fully back MVC + framework usage... so it's **infuriating** when my co-workers simply ignore all of my points (and ignore what the industry says) and assume that any design pattern of any kind is terrible.

It's like somebody riding a bicycle with their break pads constantly grinding their wheels. It's slowing them down, making things inefficient, wasting time, and is overall really, really bad for the whole biking process. But when you tell them ""hey, if you move your breakpads, biking will be a lot better"" - they reply ""**No, fuck you, my way is the right way, your way is contrived and dumb**"".

The response that I received was enormous and the information invaluable. But I really want to dismiss any doubt from my newbie brain before I decide to walk down that road and I want to stand upon a comment that I received (among others) that claimed ASP.NET is a lock-down and Microsoft's technologies are inferior. The comment can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/13xkw5/i_have_all_the_free_time_to_learn_web_development/c78eh5v).

I also can see from a fellow redditor that I'm not the only person baffled by this. Now, I know that naturally people get defensive or offensive when it comes to the language that they invested years to learn or hate accordingly. What I'm asking is proof enough that shows it's bad for a beginner to get into C# and ASP.NET particularly. Like, are there no jobs? Because from a quick monster/indeed/stackoverflow search that doesn't seem to be the case. Is the language bad? Because I haven't really checked it yet but people tell me that C# is somehow similar with Java.

I mostly want to hear the arguments for or against it.

Other javascript validator tools insist on keeping the actual validation rules in a javascript file far away from the HTML, so right-click-inspect-element doesn't show whats going on. I thought it might be neat to make a plugin that keeps the interesting parts of validation on the inputs in stead.

Bootstrap's forms offer predictable markup, so I thought it could be useful to make it re-usable and extendable too.

I think I've taken it as far as I need right now, so I'm looking for feedback. Feature suggestions, bug reports, general opinions, that sort of thing.

Oh, and before anyone mentions it, I validate server-side as well, and so should you :)
