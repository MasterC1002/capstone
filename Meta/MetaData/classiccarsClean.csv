i had originally planed to go look at this car but one thing lead to another, and $900 later i had a car and about 5 trailer tires in place of my back seat. and well we got it back, i had to put in a new ignition switch on the bird and no surprise it did moot. starter would start but it couldnt catch any thing. i later realized that someone had smashed in a small part of the fuel line so that was quickly cut out. time goes on we rebuild the carb and nothing. later on we realized engine rebuild was the way to go. new engine in tow i went to a place called falcon auto (niche market right?) and i saw MY back seat on this guys shelf! i couldn't believe it i got so lucky on that one its crazy the fact that it was in this guys garage for who know how many years meant that it was actually in better shape than the front. later on though working on it i realized that i would get hives every time i worked in my car... the 47 year old seat guts were actually giving me hives. and i still drove it. **NO REGRETS** i eventually had to stop this for obvious reasons though ripped out the weird plastic-y carpet they put in stock took the seats to the local lowrider shop and put in a new carpet myself. custom door panels followed just after. threw some racing stripes to make the thing look less terrible and had fun parking by people who parked 6 spaces away from everyone *especially chevys*  later on i realized that this need to go too and i had no funds left from all my other work on it so i bought some rattle cans and went to work. i am an actual stencil artist so why not? shaved off some chrome and put the same paint hunters use to camo out their trucks and white primer and bam. people love the little guy. head turner and eye catcher but the thing still wont sell. so for now this is the old bird thats stuck with me, poor thing."	t5_2t1di	True

The mechanic ([Edd China](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edd_China)) is an absolute legend and builds a lot of the more crazy things for Top Gear, like the motorised shed, and gives good tips on restoration and repair jobs.

The buyer/salesman ([Mike Brewer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Brewer_%28television_presenter%29)) can be a little annoying at times with his piss-taking haggling style, but you can tell he's really passionate about the cars.

There are [certain places](http://watchseries.eu/serie/wheeler_dealers) you can watch online, if you're interested.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Edit:

In case anyone's interested it seems you can buy those cool orange nitrile gloves from [Edd's website](http://www.greasejunkie.com/grease-junkie/nitrile-workshop-gloves.html).

[Him](https://twitter.com/#!/TheEddChina) and [Mike](https://twitter.com/#!/mikebrewer) also seem to respond to car questions on Twitter fairly often."	t5_2t1di	True

They are my primary daily drivers.  I just finished rebuilding the front suspension on the Pontiac, in addition to converting the generator to an alternator, putting in a huge triple core radiator, electric fan, resurfacing water pump housing...interior and stereo system.  Oh, and $675 to have the transmission gone through and leaks fixed.  Finally, a new set of Coker white walls and It's now more rock solid than it ever has been.  Original 316 v8 w/ 4bbl carb.  Dual exhaust, Y pipes split to lake pipes on the side and dumped dual flowmaster 40's out the back.  Custom interior and headliner.  Now has '59 cadillac running lights.  Lowered 3"" with blocks in the back.

The Mustang (my first car, which my twin brother and I bought when we were 16) has been a daily driver since 1998.   We just finished a disc brake conversion on her, and now are sorting out a cooling issue.  Hopefully the new water pump and electric fan will make up for all the rust in the block from sitting for 10 years after we left for college...

What I found amazed and shocked me at the same time. The previous (and original owner) said the seat had new cushion put in during the restoration in '93. Apparently, whoever did it (in the mountains of SW Va.) thought they'd be clever and shove the old padding in the back of the seat behind the wire frame/springs for some added lumbar support. Apparently, that's what was causing the back panel to bend outward (it's just cardboard, but the vinyl covering it is all stretched out). Shit like that just bugs me. 

Also, silicon everywhere in a pathetic attempt to stop leaks (power steering, transmission pan, dipsticks, oil pan, just about every damn gasket). Been slowly fixing that one - major and easy to get to gaskets taken care of, need to replace oil pan since the drain plug is all screwed up and their solution was more silicon. 

If you're going to spend the time fixing something, do it right. Don't skimp and do a shoddy job to get it done / get the paycheck. Okay, rant over.. Anyone with me? Maybe it's just this particular car with it's laundry list of questionable workmanship (nothing too hard to fix, just numerous and somewhat time consuming) - last one ('53 Bel Air) was moreso dealing with the crappy factory tolerances and specs. Things were far better in '69 in this regard.."	t5_2t1di	True
1332058471.0	r1umv	Parts stolen from my girlfriend's 1957 Cadillac (mostly a venting rant too complicated for a TL;DR) (Xpost from r/Cadillac)		15	0	12	"So I know nothing about cars. My girlfriend is the car person. She can point out caddies by the year (and many other cars). Cadillacs are dear to her cos they were her dad's thing. He died a year ago on New Year's Eve. He and her had been working on this car for about 25 years.
She needed a place to store her car, after he died. My parents have land with a shop on it and we were storing it there. It was locked and supposed to be safe.

My parents moved to Arizona but I and my girlfriend are in Northern Idaho. My parents had a family friend looking after the place, which is too far away from where we live to go check on the property semi-regularly. We checked it out today. Long story short we discovered the car had been removed from the locked shop and placed in a smaller garage that couldn't be locked even if the doors could have been closed, which they couldn't be cos the car was too long.

Various parts were missing. Lots of chrome, including a piece that was between the windshield and the hood of the car (I dunno what it is, like I said I'm not the car guy, and my girlfriend isn't next to me at the moment). 

Most of the chrome wasn't on the car, it was in the car, waiting to be put back on. It's all gone now. At least two plastic containers are gone too. They had lots of little stuff like the original screws for stuff.

We called the cops and I have a suspect in mind. Some local scum mechanic. The police want a list, to the best of our ability, of parts missing. That's what the girlfriend is doing right now.

Thanks for reading if you did."	t5_2t1di	True

I am still unsure about the codes -6A(possibly color) or 11M(its an M code car meaning 351W 4bbl so I'm assuming that is the engine code).  The 53202 has me stumped, as does the 1W at the end."	t5_2t1di	True

Since then it has had a replaced engine (302 to a 355sbc) which I got from a guy who was going to put it in a 55 Chevy but ended up wanting to go with a big block.

This is my first car and have learned that 62-67 Novas were not meant to last. There is no frame, the body is the frame so its super unsafe but I love the look of these cars. Theres also a Mustang II front end that opens up the engine compartment so there actual room to work/put headers on. 

All in all I love this car and I plan on keeping it forever and finally decided to show it with you all.

Does anyone know what this car could be worth completely restored? We've both searched around for a while but haven't found anything.

I ask because it is in pretty bad shape and will need a lot of work we cannot do ourselves (we've also heard that the stock engine has to be rebuilt after every 25 hours of driving), and if we cannot justify the cost of a full restore, we would like to modify it to be street legal instead.

Anyone on r/classiccars have any good barn find stories?  

My family has a '51 Chevy sedan that is family owned since new (50,000ish miles).  The barn it was stored in caught fire and as we hastily pulled it out with a tractor it scraped the doorway and ran deep scratches down the length of the car (car had JUST been repainted btw...)  Was put into storage with plans to get it painted again and it never happened.  Car hasn't been licensed since '87.  :(

Anyways, here's a few sites that I've found to be pretty great

good write ups, thorough stories and descriptions for most

some qualify as barn find, some don't.  Either way it's another of my favorite sites:

* 81k Miles

* Garaged and undriven in past 5-10 years

* Interior is clean, cloth, no moonroof, not sure if it's a designer edition.

* Exterior needs clean up with numerous dings and minor corrosion spots. No major body damage.

* Mechanically and electrically this car is in unknown condition. Was owned by a lady who took good care of it, and was garaged in good running condition.

* Chrome is not pitted. Bumpers and grill look nice.

I don't have use for this car or a place to store it. But it has value and I don't know how much. Would you:

I am currently looking for an older muscle car and maybe could help me along with which one to look for.
Both my mother and father have owed a Nova SS and a Chevelle SS. I looked into a Chevelle and couldn't find any in my price range. I'm trying to keep the price under $5000. I know I won't find anything in perfect condition.
Like I said I didn't find anything in the Chevelle section, but did find [this](http://reading.craigslist.org/cto/3702235082.html) so something similar but not necessarily a nova(obviously I would want standard trans.

The engine runs fine apart from when the engine is switched off. about 30 seconds after the engine is switched off, fuel starts to pour out of the main jet and into the venturi. My theory is that the body of the carb is getting too hot and causing the fuel to boil. has anyone else experienced this? is there anyway i can stop it?	t5_2t1di	True

My Dad's got a beautiful 1967 Cadillac El-Dorado Biaritz, I'll try and find some pictures if I can. In the meanwhile, here's my story.

My whole life my Dad and I have talked about letting me take the Cadi out to my prom, the problem is he hasn't started it in a year and he's afraid that if there's a problem with the oil in the pistons the engine might go haywire if we start it. The car has family history (belonged to my grandfather, RIP) so we simply aren't going to risk turning it on unless our ""Cadillac guy"" makes sure its okay. 

Our problem is that our guy is on vacation so we need to find a mechanic fluent in classic cars in the San Diego area that can help us by Saturday. Thanks for taking the time to read this and hopefully help me have the night of my life this Saturday.

EDIT thanks so much for your PM anonymous Redditor, car is working and freshly cleaned.

Like the title says, I just got myself an 81 z28 and I'm loving it. Through out the day I have been fixing the small things. I got the power windows working, but my issue is the power locks.

They were not working at all before, but now I got them to actually  ""click"", however the locks won't move at all. They will stay in what ever position they are in at the moment. I can open them fine with the key and manually from the inside. But like I said, the switches make them ""click"" but not move.

Is there another thing in common with them besides the fuse? Don't know what else to check. It has to be something they share, since both doors are doing it.

Any advice would be great! Thanks!"	t5_2t1di	True

Koppyx	11	2	14	"I have an extremely strong desire to restore cars, or just anything with cars in general... I don't see them as a thing, I see them as a beautiful work of art and craftsmanship. For about as long as I can remember, I've wanted to restore a classic car, however, living in the poor family that I live in, that's not really an option. 
I love all cars, don't get me wrong, I will cherish every car I ever own.
However.. There is 2 cars that I would literally do anything in the world for. I consider both classics, although you all may not.. at least for one of them. 

My first car that I WILL have some day. I don't care what it takes, this car will be in my possession before I die.. 

That car would be a 1993-1998 Toyota supra. In my book, that's a classic, and my favorite car of all time.

My second favorite car, although slightly less appealing to me than a Supra, is a 1965 Pontiac Gto. I can honestly say that is the most bad ass car I could ever see myself owning.. I mean, yeah a shelby cobra would be sick, but i don't see myself making that much money before I die.. 

I just want to hear your guys' opinions. These are my favorite cars, but they are just the ones i like a little bit more than any other car, because I love all cars..

Thanks guys, have a great day!"	t5_2t1di	True

She's a 55 Buick Special. Apparently, it runs well enough (no, I didn't ask him to start it) for the owner to have driven to his storefront to park it. She does have some cancer in the floor boards, but the outer body is fairly solid. As far as I could tell, all of the chrome was there including the original hubcaps. The seats need reupholstered, but the frames seem intact. She's also been switched from a 6 to a 12 volt system. He's asking $10,500 for it (I'm sure he's negotiate), which I don't feel is too awful for this beauty. PM me if you'd like his number.

My definition of spam has been blatant advertisements (e.g. I have this car for sale), links to the front page of a website with for-sale items, and links to completely unrelated material.  I either flag these as spam or remove the links to help keep things on topic. 

I have been noticing more online magazines are posting links to articles on their sites.  I have allowed this to occur for a couple reasons

1) They are linking to specific articles or pictures and not simply to the front page

2) There is full disclosure they represent the site with their username.


3) The links are on topic (e.g. about classic cars and trucks, etc)

Now and then these links are reported as spam.  I guess my question for the community is whether these links are a healthy contribution or not.  "	t5_2t1di	True

He said it's a piece of shit because it's not the original color. It is though. The paint code is 71 (LeMans blue) and that's the color of the car. Usually I'm not one to argue but he has really annoyed me tonight. He has been saying that his father's 1978 Corvette is so much better but doesn't have any reasons for saying so. My boyfriend didn't even know what I meant when I asked him if he was looking for a 4 cylinder or a 6 cylinder when he was car shopping recently. 

I've been raised around cars my whole life. I helped my dad and grandpa with their cars when I was a kid, my first car was a 1969 Chevelle and helped restore it, and I still help my dad with his cars today. I get extremely annoyed when I'm told that I don't know anything about cars because I'm a female. Especially when it comes from someone who doesn't even know how to change the oil in a car. Now that I've ranted I have a question. How do you all feel about both cars?

Well We've got it running now and took it to our first car show (in galesburg/agusta) and We got first place in trucks! It was amazing and i felt so close to my great grandpa, he died a month after I was born because of a brain tumor. So now I came here because I've been searching for more information about the truck (like what it was used for, was it popular, etc.) I really want to learn as much as I possibly can and any info would be GREATLY appreciated.

It has 65000 original miles on it, and is basically all original (except the engine, but the original engine, 2.4 I6 I believe, is sitting in the garage.)

This is the car that I will probably be fixing and driving (as a first car), until I can afford a newer one. That is unless my dad decides to trade it for a 99 Jeep Cherokee (we pulled it out of the garage because he was trading it, but after seeing it, I think it wouldn't take too much to get it road worthy again, and I really wouldn't mind driving it.) 

Any tips on things I should look into replacing if I end up keeping it? Should the connecting rod/crankshaft bearings be replaced? Crankshaft seals? Fuel pump? Oil pump? 
Any help would be great. Also, can anyone recommend good sites for getting parts for this? I know about Rockauto.com, but that's about it."	t5_2t1di	True

I bought [this 1978 Triumph Spitfire](http://i.imgur.com/8AcUb.jpg) for $1500 CDN. I figured it would be good candidate for restoration because the previous (and first) owner has had the engine, transmission and differential all professionally re machined and rebuilt. The engine runs like a clock, and came with all the mechanics reciepts, totalling just over $3000. Like most British cars, the sills are [completely gone,](http://imgur.com/a/9QQA7) the front bumper chrome is peeling, and the fender has a shotty crash repair job on it. All the upholstery and seats are also shot. The real issue with the car is the extensive rust on the [frame members](http://imgur.com/a/YcaCZ) that extend to the rear bumper.

My plan to restore the car to driving condition is
* Strip the interior
* Replace both sills + stiffner plates
* Patch rusted metal behind sills
* Replace crash damaged drivers rear fender
* Fabricate new floor pans in footwells
* Lift body off of frame
* Repair rear frame members
* Body filler the smaller rust spots on the body
* Complete paint job + re plate chrome trims
* Fabricate vinyl and plastic interior panels
One year in, [this is where I am at now](http://imgur.com/a/lTvsF)
Next step is to lift the body tub off of the frame to repair and inspect the frame and suspension. 

To replace the seats, I acquired ""utility seats"" for a really good price. They don't look [too conspicuous,](http://imgur.com/a/hKAlA) but i'm not quite sure if I will use them yet. 

I have purchased

* A new Convertible top

* Sills and one fender

* Kit with new bolts and urethane bushings for body/frame mounts

* New wind shield

* All new rubber seals for body

* pre-cut carpet kit

All the stuff I bought adds up to about $2000, and I have another $1000 budgeted for professional paintwork and new tires. I know it would have been cheaper to buy a better driving example, but I have really enjoyed working on the car with my Dad, and my friends; and I have learned a lot.

 I have a few questions I would like to ask you car restoration gurus: 

*everything electric on the car currently works. Will it be worth it to rewire the car while it is gutted? or how should I inspect the wires and connections? Being Lucas electric equipment I am worried about future failures

*How should I go about repainting the car? should I sand the car to bare metal? prime it myself? (i'm a beginner when it comes to a full paint job)

*how do I keep myself motivated to keep chopping up and tearing apart my car?

1364909383.0	1bihtr	Question about negative power cable on '72 Mustang.	NottaGrammerNasi	11	4	7	"Good morning all. This is going to be a multi-part question, sorry. Also, if I use the wrong word or sound like I don't know what I'm talking about, I probably don't but I'm trying (we all have to start somewhere).

* I guess first question would be; is this the right sub-reddit to ask mechanical type questions about a classic mustang? This sub and the /mustang sub appears to be a lot of picture posting, so I wan't sure if I was in the right place. However, I wanted to make sure my question was directed to people who were familiar with old classics, so I steered away from automatovetraining.

* So to my actual question. I need to replace my negative power cable. No place appears to sell my cable though. They keep saying it's a ""multi cable solution"". Here is a pic from the [mechanics guide](http://i.imgur.com/2DBg849.jpg). You can see how it Y-splits from the battery connector. When I look at the multi-part solutions they recommend, I can't really figure out how it's supposed to work. The only thing I can figure is it connects from the battery to the engine block, *then* grounded. Is that right? Or *better yet*, is there some place I can find a real replacement?

* My second question may not make sense. Currently, there are two metal rods that go up the side of the battery that hook into the metal plate the battery sits on, then a plastic thing goes across the battery to hold it in. Both the plate and those rods are fairly dirty/rusty. Is there an option to replace the plate and/or those rods with something to make removing my battery easier? I hate having to wrestle with the bolts anytime I need to remove the battery.

Bonus: Here's the [Mustang next to my old '87 GTA](http://i.imgur.com/hBXxq.jpg) that someone totaled. Here it is again [with it's guard dog](http://i.imgur.com/fhy8n.jpg). And a [more recent up close](http://i.imgur.com/qfSpA.jpg) pic."	t5_2t1di	True

Both are '41 Dodge WC military trucks. The full cab was the one I picked up originally because I didn't want another open cab vehicle. (I already have a '57 Cj5) Turns out that the closed cab, while more desireable to me, was not in as good a shape as the open cab. The open cab has a more complete, less hacked up chassis. So nearly a year after dragging the closed cab home, I scrounged up the coin to bring home the open cab. 

I've already got the sheet metal off both of them, and just waiting for a neighbor to lend me his front loader tractor so I can pull the engine/transmissions so I can begin assessing the situation. 

In the end, I will have a period original (not correct, but still of the era) closed cab flat bed truck that will have had a military history, but is not a restoration. I'll use the original engine and drivetrain, but with small upgrades like alternator, 12v, under cap electronic ignition and other such things. Out ward it will look stock.

FWIW, the closed cab ( to the best of my knowledge) is an aftermarket by Budd Body that was added to the military chassis and sold to the public. The date code on the cab is 1941, so this truck didn't see the war even though it is obviousy prior miliatry. The 'donor' open cab is a '41 WC21."	t5_2t1di	True

I found an ad with this car recently and it really caught my eye even though I am a VW guy (working on cars with a friend; Golf 2 Cabrio, Passat 1; some war / post war pieces of his dads).
I would kindly like to ask for advice on this car. Personally I've never seen one before (location is EU:CZ). I don't know what engine is supposed to sound like, how much rust and wear to expect. I can go see this piece before purchase but having some info from folks would be more than helpful. Some idea on how much the car is worth would also help.
I've read wikipedia article and some more articles which pretty much repeat 'the rust and recall' story (see wikipedia).

What I know so far about this car:
Year 1978
EB 3 engine 1229ccm 44kW
Origin from germany, original service book, other papers
Should run, break, shine
Tank is unmounted for repair, runs on gas from bottle
New clutch, breaks, liquids
Replaced Hondamatic(included) with 5-speed
Rust is at least as much can bee seen on pics.
Thanks for all useful info in advance.

Some points:
Newer Second Gen on eBay 1-5k USD in very good condition on US eBay
Offer in CZ for 13k USD, seriously overshot imho

Cons:
Rust, needs welding of body work
Don't know where was the 'popular' rust problem was so I can inspect
Don't know about part availability
Don't know engine longevity (I know VWs of same age can still run ok)

Pros:
Good looking, start of popular Civic series

What in your opinion would be the best candidate for the job of a classic daily driver? In determining this, I chose to weigh the following criteria:

* reliability;
* ease to service;
* visual appeal;
* economy (both mpg's and maintenance/repair costs);
* durability (i.e., can handle snow and salted roads w/out rusting appart)
* safety; and
* comfort

He has money (although he is frugal), so that's not an issue. He literally knows nothing about cars, and is not the type to pick up a book and learn. I had to tell him that he can't just drop off his mustang at the local auto repair place when it breaks down, and had to explain that the parts are probably hard to come by (although he does live in a big city).

He probably won't bring in a professional to inspect whatever he buys, and will probably add racing stripes, a new interior with colors he likes, and other exterior changes. I'm worried he's going to eventually ruin a nice car, waste his time and money, and be disappointed, since I'm not sure he will pay a premium to take it to a auto shop that will take care of it and give him good advice when he needs it.

His first plan is after buying it is to drive it 500 miles back home, which seems like a bad idea and might end up having to tow it half way when he realizes it will take time to locate and ship parts for his car.

1339993857.0	v7kne	Project daily driver Torino XPOST /r/Autos	titanshub	7	0	2	"[Quality Pictures](http://imgur.com/a/sNwt4)

A few months ago I bought a 1969 Torino GT and posted some early pictures on /r/autos. The car has spent most of the last few months at a local mechanic who was kind enough to help me get a few important issues fixed. She needed to pass inspection so I could get her on the road and get to know my new car. On Wednesday she got out of car jail and I have been putting her through her paces since.

So to start off I picked up the car for $6500. I spent $300 to tow it home because while she ran, she had some glaring safety issues, namely the breaks. At the shop she got a new windshield, new power brake booster, new Holly 4150 600cfm carburetor, an engine tune (including timing and carb tune), custom carb linkage courtesy of my master mechanic, and we found an stopped a power steering leak. This ran around $1800. In addition to this I had the mechanic look over the suspension and keep an eye out for any glaring rust or safety issues. None were found. This put my total investment into the car at about $8600ish.

The car sounded much better after I got it back from the mechanic. I was originally worried about transmission issues because she had a wicked stutter in first gear and a slight flare from 2nd going into third but the engine tune seems to have made almost all of that go away.

I put about 300 miles on the car before issues emerged again. The passenger window fell out of its tray and I found a misfire at about 2000+RPM. A quick inspection of my spark plug wires found a wire that was not seating correctly into the distributor cap and a significant amount of wear on said cap. I replaced the spark plug wires and pulled the distributor cap and my Pentronix Flame thrower 2 ignition coil off of my old Mustang. She purr's like a kitten now at all RPM's.

I also took that door apart and found the rails that the window rides on were coated in sticky old axle grease. I cleaned them up with some degreaser and a rag and coated them in a light coat of white lithium grease I had sitting around. I don't know if it will set up like that old axle grease does but I really hope it doesn't as that is a nightmare job. I reassembled the passenger window and it seems to work great for the moment.

The car appears to have some highway gears in the back and initial testing shows somewhere between 15-18mpg on the highway at 70mph. This is about what I was expecting and significantly better than my old mustang. I would expect once I get all my issues sorted out to be sitting closer to the 18mpg mark than the 15mpg mark but only time will tell.

The next thing I get done will be some interior work. I have a local guy who has done an estimate for me on the headliner and front seat cover but I have not had a chance to talk to him yet. I will get her into the shop in the next couple of weeks to get this and couple of pieces of trim in the back fixed. I also suspect a replacement radio is on the way soon. Something with FM and an AUX input would be fantastic. I may look at finding a way to hide a couple more speakers as well because she currently only has one mounted under the dash.

Anyway, hope you like it."	t5_2t1di	True

1328076386.0	p5shj	1968 mustang start up problems	timmy2000	8	1	8	"I've never worked on cars before and want to start as a hobby.  The car belonged to my grandfather and is in overall good working order from when i had worked on it but has been sitting for a few months while I was away at school and I'm having trouble getting it started now.  I know it's a problem with fuel because the car runs as long as i drip gas or starter fluid right down the carb throat.  I replaced the gas in the tank and added water remover.  I've disconnected the fuel line to the carb to a tank and it shoots out gas while the car is starting so i know the pump is working.  I tried used carb cleaner on it to try and get rid of any build up.  Now I'm considering either taking apart, cleaning and rebuilding the original carb myself (Motorcraft 4 barrel 4300) or just replacing the damn thing with a new carb.  This carb has always been a pain but on the other hand I kind of want to keep the car as original as possible and possibly save some money if i don't have to replace it.  Anyway I was wondering if anyone who works on cars could offer any advice as to where to get a rebuild kit online or retailer or if it would be better to just go with a more new carb and what classic car connoisseurs think of the new carb approach because I want to do whats right for the car.  Or another possible diagnosis. Even after reading the shop manuel and theory of operation the actual carb still seems like a mechanical mystery to me.

UPDATE:
I set up an external gas tank to the carb and used gravity to feed fuel to the carb like peppp described.  The car started right up!  I checked around and didn't see any fuel leaking and no gas was coming from the car's fuel line to the empty tank.  So, it must be a problem with the fuel pump.  Thanks for the advice everyone."	t5_2t1di	True

Anyway. It's a blue '68. Under the hood is a 327 crate motor with, literally, less than 200 miles on it hooked into a Powerglide with a Hurst shifter. Disc brakes, custom headers, new distributor/alternator/battery, tie rod ends, two-week-old carpet, headliner, and door panels, new BF Goodrich T/As, the works. The body is in excellent condition as well. It is really a sharp looking car.

That said, he's asking $10k for it on Craigslist. Does this sound like a decent amount to ask? What are some other good avenues that I could recommend to him if Craigslist doesn't work for him? I could provide a link to the CL listing if it helps anyone out. Thanks!"	t5_2t1di	True
