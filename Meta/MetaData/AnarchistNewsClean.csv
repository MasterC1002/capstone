1329413438.0	psj83	We've reached 2000 subscribers!	NihiloZero	26	3	3	"Thanks to everyone who has subscribed to [r/AnarchistNews](http://www.reddit.com/r/anarchistnews)!  I'd especially like to thank everyone who has submitted links, voted, and/or commented to this subreddit.

I think it's now fairly clear that there was a demand not being met by other anarchist subreddits (some of which are still [not actually promoting anarchism in the most positive light](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/j6txt/censorship_in_ranarchism_23_screenshots_that_will/)).

[Even if you are not an anarchist](http://anarchistnews.org/node/15111), I don't think it behooves anyone to have the finer points of anarchism (mis)represented by those who seem bent on antagonizing the broader population (while simultaneously deleting posts and banning users for dubious reasons).  I am, of course, writing about r/anarchism and the trolls who moderate that subreddit with a heavy and unjust hand.  [Their un-anarchistic abuses of power are fairly well known](http://www.reddit.com/r/metanarchism/comments/j4wfe/everybody_thinks_were_a_joke_because_of_the_mods/) to the broader anarchist community on Reddit, but I will elaborate a bit for those of you who may be new or not privy to unsavory subtleties of that subreddit.  If you follow the embedded links in this text you might find some enlightening articles/posts on the subject. 

Personally, I was banned for mistakenly referring to a user as a generic ""he.""  I didn't even realize what I had done at the time and wasn't allowed to defend myself in the kangaroo court of r/metanarchism.  The irony is that the person who was apparently the victim of my errant word proved to be [an overtly transphobic bigot and remains active on those subreddits](http://www.reddit.com/r/metanarchism/comments/ksa28/straight_up_misgendering_and_oppression_on_the/).  Many others have similar stories.

In any case... the moderators of this subreddit (r/AnarchistNews) have committed to taking a fairly hands-off approach except in terms of submitting content, voting, commenting, and cleaning out the spam filter.  We let the community regulate itself by means of upvotes and clarifying arguments.  Sometimes... we simply ignore the trolls and move on.  But we don't deign to have any sort of superior knowledge about what may (or may not) be offensive to any particular group or what should (or should not) be discussed.  Even if a hostile and offensive person were to comment, it might somehow serve as a lesson about how to deal with such people in the real world.  We're more interested in presenting and maintaining an arena of ideas rather than being vanguardists trying to establish a safe space (sic) anywhere other than in the real world.

So, once again, I'd like to thank all of you who have subscribed and contributed to this subreddit.  If you haven't subscribed yet I'd encourage you to do so.  The subreddit is still growing and could use your support in this regard.  Reddit needs an anarchist subreddit which doesn't see the mods trolling, flaming, and generally giving a bad name to anarchism.  Reddit needs [an anarchist subreddit where ideas can be discussed freely and are not arbitrarily deleted by hypocritical and unethical moderators.](www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/j4o40/free_speech_is_bourgeois/) So please... help us spread the word to keep [r/AnarchistNews](http://www.reddit.com/r/anarchistnews) growing!

1318189490.0	l69m7	r/AnarchistNews has 1000 subscribers!  	NihiloZero	28	6	11	"That may not seem like a very large number to some of you, but r/AnarchistNews has only been a Reddit ""community"" for less than 3 months!  So... we're fairly pleased to have reached 1000 subscribers in that amount of time.  

This subreddit was created to fill the need of anarchists (and others) who we're being abused by the belligerent moderators of r/anarchism -- the subreddit where legitimate posts are still being removed along with posts from trolls (with an exemption for the moderator trolls themselves).  Others, like myself, have been banned for things like mistakenly referring to a moderator as a generic ""he"" in a passing comment (while [that very same moderator gets away with accusing transgendered people of abusing ""male privilege""](http://www.reddit.com/r/metanarchism/comments/ksa28/straight_up_misgendering_and_oppression_on_the/)).  I won't go over all [*the reasons again*](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/j6txt/censorship_in_ranarchism_23_screenshots_that_will/) why this subreddit was created, but there are plenty of [reasons not to trust the moderators of r/Anarchism](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/j4o40/free_speech_is_bourgeois/) with any submissions/comments or as any sort of representative for anarchist thought.  

The main thing though, the reason I'm writing this self-post, is to encourage you to continue submitting content and comments to this subreddit, r/Anarchistnews.  Good contributions are evermore likely to be seen, spur discussion, and earn you a decent amount of karma.  If you're reading this but haven't yet subscribed and placed r/AnarchistNews on your front page, I urge you to do so now!  With your help r/AnarchistNews will continue to grow and present uncensored anarchist content and comments.  

We, the moderators of r/AnarchistNews, will continue cleaning out the spam filter while letting the downvotes address ignorance and trolls.  Content will not be censored on this subreddit because of your race, gender, sexuality, or for any other reason.  As I've said before, it's no great moral accomplishment as a moderator to refrain from censoring people on Reddit.  If you are a troll or someone promoting bigoted and ignorant ideas... the users of this subreddit are not afraid to downvote you and might even tell you why you are wrong if they disagree with any positions you may be putting forward!  Shocking, I know.                      

So what are you waiting for?!  Submit some content, spark some dialogue, and [subscribe to r/AnarchistNews](http://www.reddit.com/r/AnarchistNews/)!      "	t5_2snj8	True

1370628693.0	1fvkis	[Self] Am I the only one who is bothered by the fact that even left-wing media ignore the fact that Bradley Manning is transgender?	forwormsbravepercy	28	8	12	"I've just been catching up on some coverage on Manning's military trial that began this week, and it struck me that although Brad is transgender and identifies as a woman, it never gets mentioned.  According to Denver Nicks in the (highly recommended) book *Private: Bradley Manning, WikiLeaks, and the Biggest Exposure of Official Secrets in American History*, Bradley Manning had already told her supervising officer about the transgenderism, and was expecting to be discharged via DADT within weeks of her arrest.  A big part of this story, I think, is Brad Manning's psychology; if you read the book, you get a really detailed picture of the life and times of Bradley Manning, from the childhood that was stolen from her to the twisted relationship with her mother and father.  You also see how hacker culture provided an avenue for Brad to fit in and stand out in a positive way.  You also see how Brad developed an ultimately very dangerous form of narcissism as a defense mechanism against all of this hatred coming at him (still at this point a gay male) from the outside world.  All of this leads to what I think we can only call a rather brave yet unbelievably careless operation to achieve true hacker heroism.  The story that is traditionally conveyed is that Brad leaked the documents, and then got big in the head and more or less bragged to Adrian Lamo, who fucked him.  But this leaves out something really crucial: Brad Manning has *always* been big in the head; it was this narcissism that motivated the kamikaze act in the first place.  He wasn't doing it, as so many of our comrades want to imagine, in order to liberate a mass of people or overturn global capitalism or overthrow the American state or anything else.  One reason Brad Manning joined the military is that he was a patriot, and loved America and the military.  He continued to love America throughout his service (though I doubt she's very much of a patriot these days...).  In other words, I think that if we understand the life -- the sexual life, the family life, the personal life -- of Bradley Manning, then we can really understand what the motive was for ""the biggest leak in history,"" a supposedly notorious crime.  And if we can understand the real motive, then we can also demonstrate quite easily that this wasn't a real crime -- it wasn't intended to do harm or aid the enemy.  Brad Manning actually wanted to embarrass the military so that it improved itself, and he wanted to be a hero.  These two things -- the anti-authoritarianism as well as the desire to be loved by others -- are what I see to be the real motivation for Manning's ""crime.""  Ultimately, getting this message out means opening up a space in the discourse for the (correct) feminine pronouns ""she"" ""her"" and so on when referring to Brad Manning.  I think it is a fact that Brad Manning refers to herself as such, and this should be respected in the broader society.

My point is, it is a known fact among radicals that Brad Manning is transgender.  Why does no one push this agenda, though?  This doesn't mean doing story after story about it necessarily.  Instead, it means, for example, that we insist that our radical media use the pronoun ""she"" when the refer to Brad Manning.  What do you say, workers?"	t5_2snj8	True

Please spread this as much as you can. Turkish government and police are using chemical agents and incredibly unproportional force against the Occupy Gezi protesters. Mainly in Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir. We cannot breathe in air here, we breathe agent orange (the kind of the thing that has been used in Vietnam War), we breathe tear gas, we breathe pepper spray, we breathe torture... PM is saying he's not stepping back. We need anyone, any help that has the ability to influence government. For those who have a slight doubt that the protesters might have done anything wrong; the protesters were protesting by reading BOOKS on cops faces, we do not even carry anything violent. We carry food, anti-acid+water solution, vinegar. I saw people leaving food on streets, so that people in need could pick them up. I saw hotels and high schools and colleges and whorehouses opening their doors to help. HELP US! Spread this! Dont let the world have the illusion that Turkey is a democratic country! Cause it is not. It was not and has not been. It's only democratic towards those have the opinions in-line with government. This goes many many years back; we have not improved even a slight bit. I work for Bloomberg and the office is in Taksim. I do not even know how I will get there tomorrow, since I live in the Asian side. If I cannot go tomorrow, I might be fired; if i do; i might not be able to return back home for many days. If it's gonna happen, it's going to happen.

1364785833.0	1becsm	[META] We're making some changes to /r/AnarchistNews	NihiloZero	21	4	126	"
Xylon and I started this subreddit so that Reddit would have an anarchist forum which allowed for more open discussion about various topics and sensitive subjects of interest to anarchists.  It was our hope that this subreddit could thrive with very little censorship and without banning various users.  We thought we could present an alternative to /r/Anarchism -- which we felt was stifling to seasoned anarchists and off-putting to casual users who were not up to speed on all the issues.  And we sincerely believed that the creation of this subreddit was a necessary and good thing for any anarchists who might use Reddit.

Unfortunately, while we still feel this subreddit has its place, it has become evermore clear to us that all sorts of mean and nasty people use Reddit.  As /r/AnarchistNews has grown we've seen people here post all sorts of nasty language which could leave permenant emotional scars upon the fragile psyches of other users.  I myself have been nearly brought to tears by some of things people have written in this subreddit and it has taken all of my resolve not to ban their accounts and delete their posts.  

And now, after much soul-searching and many heartfelt discussions, Xylon and I must concede that the banhammer wielded by the moderators of /r/Anarchism was not reckless and overbearing.  We see now that the AOP must be enforced so that dialogue can take place in a free and caring subreddit.  People who use harsh words cannot be allowed derail discussions with their oppressive words.  While I used to scoff at the idea that a word such as “lame” was ableist or that a word like “drama” was sexist, I can now see the true destructive power of words.  

When I was banned from /r/Anarchism for mistakenly referring to “his sockpuppets” (in a passing comment regarding Queercoup), although I didn't even realize what I had done to get instantly banned, I can now see how my honest mistake was nevertheless completely intolerable.  Despite the fact that I have tried to promote anarchist discourse for years, and despite that fact that I've always found the act of misgendering people to be inappropriate and boorish, I should have taken better efforts to recognize what I was being accused of and what pronouns any online individual may prefer on any given day.  (Since some people change their preference many times, I might even suggest adding an individual's preferred pronoun of the day as flair).  Anyway... I'm just reiterating that I understand now why my personal ban was justified and I'm outlining now why I now believe that /r/AnarchistNews, like /r/Anarchism, also needs a zero tolerance policy in regard to the AOP.  I should also point out that this change was decided in coordination with Xylon, under his guidance, and that he, too, has also seen the error of his ways.    

With all that in mind... we need help to regulate all of the hateful speech that is incessantly posted and so we will be expanding the list of moderators in this subreddit.  Xylon and I will remain in the top mod positions, but we've decided to also add all of the moderators of /r/Anarchism to help us moderate since we will no longer merely just be cleaning out the spam filter.   Any other subscribers who also would like to have input in regard to how this subreddit is maintained will also be given mod status.  We feel this inclusiveness will help /r/AnarchistNews run more smoothly while making it a safe space for those who should not be forced to read certain words.        
 
I'd also like to announce the creation of /r/AnarchistMeta, which can be used to discuss any issues or ideas for any of the anarchist subreddits.  However, it should be noted that this meta will not be a “safe space.”  This will be a place to discuss any issues regarding any subreddit having to do with anarchist issues.  No one will be banned and no posts or comments will be removed in /r/AnarchismMeta.

We hope everyone likes these changes and we look forward to more polite conversation!   "	t5_2snj8	True
