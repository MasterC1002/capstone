1355185682.0	14mvyi	'twas the night before skiing	brosetastone	201	32	27	"Twas the night before skiing, when all through the house 
I was the only creature stirring, except for one mouse. 
My ski bags were packed by the front door with care, 
Because the mountain was calling and I'd soon be there. 

I couldn't stay nestled all snug in my bed, 
Cuz visions of fresh tracks danced around in my head. 
Newschoolers on my computer, which I had on my lap, 
Was keeping me from getting my much-needed nap. 

When outside my window there arose such a clatter, 
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter. 
Away to the window I flew in a dash, 
Tore open the shutters; I got there in a flash. 

The moon glimmering behind the falling snow 
That was quickly covering the objects below. 
When, below my wide open eyes should appear, 
But an enormous smile that stretched ear to ear. 

My lips had sprung up, so lively and quick, 
I knew in a moment that tomorrow would be sick. 
More rapid than eagles the snow, down it came, 
And it whistled, and shouted, it was calling my name! 

""Now Vail! Now, Alta! Now, Whistler and Jackson! 
On, Park City! On, Squaw! On Mount Snow and A-Basin! 
Snow for every mountain! Let it pile tall! 
Now get your skis! Your boards! Come one, come all!"" 

The snow kept falling, and on the ground it nested, 
And I decided that it'd be best if I were well-rested. 
I heard this when I entered my bed and the snow left sight: 
""Happy skiing to all, and to all a good-night!""

1340744334.0	vndyb	Intervention time. This Subreddit needs to stop giving bad advice. You're good people, but you recently encouraged a Redditor to buy skis that aren't at all what he needs.	Smilemon	84	18	105	"This is inspired by [this thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/skiing/comments/vktjw/some_ski_purchasing_questions/) If you happen to think that Gryffes was encouraged to make the right decision, **instead of downvoting this, try and prove me wrong.** 

I'd like to see actual discussion about skis and skiing. I feel that I know my shit pretty well, and I'm gonna stand behind what I say in this thread, but if someone comes along with a very good argument, my mind will be changed and I'll shut up.

**I'll start my actual rant now:**

You guys recommended that a 6'4"" 230lb individual buy medium flex skis that are too short for him. And then also told him that it was okay to ride a park binding that is designed for a 12-14 year old newschool skier. 

This setup would be **borderline** okay for a 5'11"" to 6'1"", 175 - 190lb rider. And even then, the bindings would make me nervous. I break bindings, and I weigh about 140-150 lbs with all my gear on.

Among serious skiers, the Schizo is a poorly reviewed binding, and has been broken by much smaller skiers than the OP. With the sliding toe-piece, it's really gimmicky. Plastic bindings are going to be under a lot of stress with a heavy rider on them. Gear talk can get a bit circle-jerky after a while. You're going to hear a lot of people recommending the Look/Pivot 180 bindings. There is a reason for this. Not all bindings are created equal. In fact, most ski bindings are absolute trash. If you're ever in doubt about what bindings to buy, get something that is all metal, with a good din range. Rossignol FKS 180s are a great buy for larger guys. If you need a smaller din range, the used market for FKS 155s is very strong. There are also good Salomon alternatives. The Griffon Royal Family binding series is generally regarded to be cheaper in construction, and the Schizo is at the bottom of their bindings in terms of durability. 

The skis might not be a terrible buy. If the OP doesn't charge on them, things might work out. If he really tries to push things, my guess is that he will find himself in want of a longer, stiffer ski. 

Pep Fujas is 175lbs and 5'8"" on a good day. This is his signature ski. A taller model of this ski is still going to be designed with a smaller skier in mind.

OP, if you can return the gear, that would be good. If not, they probably have a lot of value on the used market. Worst comes to worst, just ride them, if you don't ski a lot, your gear doesn't really matter.

There were some good posts in this thread. A few people mentioned that the skis are gonna be too small and not at all oriented toward your skiing style, but they lost out to people who just said ""Go for it!"" without providing any rational for their suggestion.

The only real rational for buying these skis is that they were fairly cheap and readily available in the UK. No one mentioned this, so don't try and cover your asses by saying ""we just wanted OP to get the best deal,"" you didn't. 

There was one really good comment made, by a skier who actually owned the same skis and didn't recommend them to the OP. When I checked this morning, it had no upvotes.

During the past month I made [shreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/snowboarding/comments/nfok3/shreddit_sticker_giveaway_2/) stickers, a giveaway which turned out far more popular than I expected. During this giveaway, a lot of skiiers asked if I could make waterproof/glossy/easy to peel stickers for you guys as well, and I promised that I would as soon as I was done in r/snowboarding. This brings me to two questions I have for you:

1) Would enough of you be interested in getting stickers?

2) Does anyone have a vector file or a general sketch of what you would like these stickers to look like? I know a fellow redditor started working on some ideas (the current logo wasn't too popular), but I don't know what ever happened to that.

Let me know what you think boys!
