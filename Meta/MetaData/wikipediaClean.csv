In the Spring of 2008 a buddy of mine was laid up with a broken leg. Knowing that he's as big a fan of Wikipedia as I am, and hoping to take his mind off of his troubles, I set out to do something that I had been wanting to do for quite a while. I had initially envisioned compiling my favorite 100 articles... figured that it was a nice, round number.  I was worried that I wouldn't have that many.

When I looked at my bookmarks I was shocked to find that I had saved _over 4,000_ Wikipedia pages.  Took me a couple of days to sift through them.  I ended up with 171 articles and 56 categories. I had originally tried rating them, but that whole angle was a subjective clusterfuck and took forever (wasn't consistent, and I just started going through the motions with the ratings), so I dropped it after the first go-round.

I got a number of friends who like Wikipedia to various degrees, so I emailed them the list.  It was a minor hit.  I posted it to _Something Awful_ where the forum goons (in-between diagnosing me with Aspergers) added quite a bit of cool stuff of their own.  You can check out [the thread](http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=2842901) for yourself if you're interested.

Since that initial post, I've made 4 addenda and posted them as well. Every few months or so I'll need to procrastinate something and pull up whatever I've bookmarked since the last list.

I hope you find some things you like and get hepped to a bunch of awesome shit that gears you up. It was a pleasure compiling it, and I hope you enjoy reading it.  I'm considering shorting tech stocks in anticipation for the thousands of man-hours that will be lost the rest of this week by people goofing off; using this list as a road-map. I'd love to hear _your_ personal Wikipedia gems, as well. I'll repost the lists in the comments below. Cheers.

1353278252.0	13f2b5	I donated to Wikipedia and this was their thank you letter. I think more people ought to do this.	CoachSnigduh	918	202	87	"Dear CoachSnigduh,
Thank you for donating to the Wikimedia Foundation. You are wonderful!
It's easy to ignore our fundraising banners, and I'm really glad you didn't. This is how Wikipedia pays its bills --- people like you giving us money, so we can keep the site freely available for everyone around the world.

People tell me they donate to Wikipedia because they find it useful, and they trust it because even though it's not perfect, they know it's written for them. Wikipedia isn't meant to advance somebody's PR agenda or push a particular ideology, or to persuade you to believe something that's not true. We aim to tell the truth, and we can do that because of you. The fact that you fund the site keeps us independent and able to deliver what you need and want from Wikipedia. Exactly as it should be.

You should know: your donation isn't just covering your own costs. The average donor is paying for his or her own use of Wikipedia, plus the costs of hundreds of other people. Your donation keeps Wikipedia available for an ambitious kid in Bangalore who’s teaching herself computer programming. A middle-aged homemaker in Vienna who’s just been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. A novelist researching 1850s Britain. A 10-year-old in San Salvador who’s just discovered Carl Sagan.

On behalf of those people, and the half-billion other readers of Wikipedia and its sister sites and projects, I thank you for joining us in our effort to make the sum of all human knowledge available for everyone. Your donation makes the world a better place. Thank you.

Most people don't know Wikipedia's run by a non-profit. Please consider sharing this e-mail with a few of your friends to encourage them to donate too. And if you're interested, you should try adding some new information to Wikipedia. If you see a typo or other small mistake, please fix it, and if you find something missing, please add it. There are resources here that can help you get started. Don't worry about making a mistake: that's normal when people first start editing and if it happens, other Wikipedians will be happy to fix it for you.

I appreciate your trust in us, and I promise you we'll use your money well.

Thanks,

Sue

Besides your usual unsolved disappearances, there are a ton of creepy, tragic, and downright fascinating stories:

[Michael Rockefeller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Rockefeller), scion of the famous American family, disappeared in New Guinea in 1961, and evidence suggests that he may have been eaten by cannibals.

[Boston Corbett](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Corbett), the Union soldier who killed John Wilkes Booth, later went insane, subsequently escaped from his asylum, and was never seen again.

[Sebastian, 16th King of Portugal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_of_Portugal) supposedly vanished in a thick fog while battling the Moors.

1309411785.0	id04g	How I became an administrator on Wikipedia and inadvertently deleted its main page. 	Michaelas10	455	192	75	"About 6 years ago, back when I was still very young and new to the Internet, I found an immense enjoyment in bettering Wikipedia. I wrote articles, participated in discussions, and did a lot of backlog stuff no one else would do like expand stub articles and correct ambiguity pages. One day, someone nominated me for adminship, and to my astonishment the nomination was successful. I wanted to be able to improve the website in ways I couldn't previously and truly leave a mark of my contribution. Suddenly and completely inexplicably, it was all tarnished when my Tourette's syndrome kicked in and I began fighting urges to abuse my newfound powers.

Yes, I know it sounds crazy, and it's easy to call me a liar on this. But bear with me. In the past I've never really associated my Tourette's with the task I was undertaking, nor did it manifest itself in this manner. Ever since I was diagnosed with it at age 6, it's been just blinking or twitching my arm, typically things which I read were common. Complex tics that involved a series of actions were not considered to fall in the Tourette's spectrum, because they weren't tics at all (or at least, that's what I thought). In fact, none of the symptoms I exhibited while on Wikipedia were tics in the conventional sense. Rather, they were itches.  I found I had a persistent, unrelenting itch to go to the administrative tools and delete an insignificant article, or ban a user, or worse.

The whole situation I found to be extremely frustrating. Retrospectively, I should have relinquished my powers right then and there, but simply had too much pride in having become an administrator and seeing all my effort on the site paid off. Each time an urge occurred, I let myself take successively greater steps, or *routines* as I've called them, in approaching doing something abusive. They reached the point of me literally hovering my mouse cursor over the delete button of some article, holding the left mouse key, and then dashing the cursor away as my grasp on the key weakened. Inevitably, one day I slipped up. Wikipedia's main page was down or unprotected for about ten minutes that day, plenty of time for thousands of people to run into a ""this article does not exist"" page and commotions to arise in various pages. While it was unprotected, a couple vandals managed to slip some edits into it ([1](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Main_Page&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=118013600), [2](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Main_Page&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=118013668)), which further added to the backlash. My immediate excuse was that my computer was being used by a sibling, and it seemed that I had been initially believed to. Later I found this was futile as my reputation has been tarnished regardless and the obsessions have seen no end in sight, leading up to me blocking and ultimately deleting my own account.

It was the first time Wikipedia's main page was deleted (besides the one instance Main *page* was moved to Main *Page*). But it wasn't last - hackers were inspired  to mimic my actions several times later that year. In 2008, it became [permanently protected from deletion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Don%27t_delete_the_main_page) after two admins debated whether it could be deleted and one of them decided to test it.

I love Wikipedia, and still edit it occasionally (under the guise of anonymity of course). This experience taught me great lessons not only about wielding power, but also about our severe lack of knowledge concerning Tourette's.

I'd like to demonstrate the events leading up to the deletion and its consequences in the form of links directly to Wikipedia pages:

He makes a very good point. Much of the information on Wikipedia is completely useless to 99.9% of the people who will browse it. Never in a million years would I need to know the biographies of obscure philosophers or towns with 50 residents in Kentucky, and I wouldn't even know what sports to look up in order to read this man's life work. 

However, the fact that it's *there*, that it's actually preserved in 50 different iterations for as long as we have computers, is important in the way that the Library of Alexandria was important. Everything on that format is effectively researched and immortalised, preserving a fairly objective platform for the one person who does need to know about that town as it was in 2011 three hundred years from now.

If you think such things don't play a role in the shaping of Encyclopedia Britannica, or any given academic journal, or Newsweek, or the Associated Press or anything else, then I suspect you are naive and have no experience in the publishing field. Editors in these publications are almost certainly going to mangle your meaning, accidentally distort accurate information and add outright inaccuracies, and you will have essentially no recourse. These seem like bigger problems with Wikipedia precisely because it is open, and these problems are easy to see and discuss.

There is certainly room for rational discussions of Wikipedia, but let's not pretend that Britannica is some monolithic, divinely-inspired font of neutral information."	t5_2qh3b	True
