I'll explain my case: I just finished Chrono Trigger and, throughout the entirety of playing, I felt immersed in the story and fully connected. I'd say that's what constitutes a fantastic game, but now that it's over, I feel an overwhelming sense of sadness. This was my first time playing it; to be honest I didn't develop an interest in RPG games until around seventeen. Prior to that, I mainly played (and still do play) platformers. Anyway...

There's a term used in literature describing the feeling of sadness once you complete a book, but I'm unable to find it at this time. Given the story-telling qualities of RPG video games, I'd say the same can be applied to this specific genre. So then, have any of you had this (or a similar) experience?"	t5_2su0w	True

Let's discuss the direction of rpgs. 	keepfighting	76	8	76	"It seems action rpgs are in and turn based is dead. And amazing, engrossing stories don't seem as prevalent as they use to be, instead the focus is on intense, challenging game play that just keeps getting harder. What do you guys think? Anyone feel disappointed? Anyone prefer the direction rpgs are going now? I could be totally missing out on something here so I'd love to start a discussion. 

**EDIT**

From what I have gathered:

* Atlus, XSeed and NIS are great companies that still develop jrpgs.
* Look into the growing indie market for turn-based rpgs.
* If you have a Wii, check out Xenoblade. 
* JRPGS and turn-based games are still going strong in the handheld market. Time to get a DS and PSP!
* There is a [JRPG subreddit!](http://reddit.com/r/JRPG)

No I’m not saying that the game outside of Midgar was bad or anything. It is just that all the advertisements, promotionals, even the polish of the game itself, Midgar was the pinnacle. It had that certain feeling to it. A Cyberpunk Blade Runner (Deus Ex if you will) style feeling. It took the capital from FFVI (which was steam punk) made it a bit more cyber and modern and ran with it. The music was the best. From the feeling of an oppressive corrupt government to finding your way through the corrupt and crime filled slumps working as a resistances group. It had lots of steam, sparks, robots, computers, wires signs and kanji (Chinese characters) everywhere. It was great! There were a few towns that felt like Midgar (Junon ect) but for me it just wasn’t the same.  Does anyone else feel like this? If so what cities in games give you the same city crawling feeling that FFVII’s Midgar did? 	t5_2su0w	True

1349967228.0	11b7km	Does Anyone Else Feel Strangely Unsatisfied by Crafting in Games like New Vegas and Skyrim?	postgygaxian	63	8	45	"The thing that I love about games is the exploration.  Unfortunately, you can only see a game for the first time once.  Exploration has little replay value for me, because I generally notice everything that I noticed before and it breaks my immersion.  Exploring the dialogue options sometimes works better, because different character builds usually get different dialogue options.

Combat often gets boring for me, and so I try to mix things up with crafting.  In New Vegas, this means having high Science, Survival, etc.  In Skyrim, it means Alchemy or Enchanting.

One key difference is that in New Vegas, some dungeons reward me for having high Science and Repair - I can interact with the environment in special ways.  E.g. I might get the opportunity to fix a useful robot using Science and Repair.  So far as I can tell Skyrim doesn't offer that kind of skill-based interaction with the environment.

This kind of reward for exploring a dungeon makes me feel that I really ought to play crafting-intensive characters - but oddly, the process of crafting in both games leaves me cold.  Somehow I feel that crafting ought to be a lot more immersive than it is.  I feel that if I could just enjoy crafting more, the games would have a lot more replay value.

Does anyone else feel this way?"	t5_2su0w	True

I vote that any and all fans, or even anybody remotely interested in the game get on Konami's Twitter, Facebook, whatever is most convenient for you and we move, we make a strike showing that there IS fan support for this game.

We recommend Suikoden 1 on PSN purely because its all we have. I don't know how many times I've said, ""You can get Suikoden 1 on PSN, but Suikoden 2 is soooo much better.""

Let's get them to think, get them to see that we want more people to experience this classic. We want to share one of the greatest stories and villains in the history of video games with more people, and having Suikoden 2 on PSN will give us so much more ammunition than just the first game, as good as it is.

--Play the tutorial. Witcher 2 uses a whole new engine from W1. Everything is different, including movement. 

-- Don't try to figure out the story until a few hours in. Names, people, places... It will come together later. It is dense. Think Game of Thrones.

-- Think of combat like Arkham Asylum/City instead of W1 or NWN2. Enemies will teabag you from all sides. So, use your signs. Don't hack and slash through everything in the Prologue. When you level up more, then you can change your style.

I played FF Tactics, Kingdom Hearts, Dragon Quest, etc. I just can't seem to enjoy classic RPGs anymore. I had a fair amount of fun playing Fallout 3 (although I didn't like New Vegas) and Skyrim, but I can't seem to get into any other RPGs. FFXII, FFXIII, Dragon Age: Origins, Dark Souls, and even games like Eternal Sonata, Blue Dragon, and Mass Effect didn't entice me. I didn't get more than 20 hours into any of them, and eventually gave up. I felt bored; the stories weren't compelling, the characters weren't interesting, nothing jumped out at me. I couldn't do it.

I am going to try playing through FFIX, but does anyone have any suggestions for modern RPGs that don't... try to do too much? I'm not sure if I'm too nostalgic, too old, or have too little time. I just can't seem to find a game that sucks me in. 

I'm not sure if this resonates with anyone else, or if I'm just a stick in the mud who doesn't enjoy cool stuff. Am I in a prolonged funk?"	t5_2su0w	True

Feel free to list more than one game, but make sure to specify which is your favorite, and explain what you like about each one!

My favorite is definitely *The Legend of Dragoon*. The Additions battle system was an incredibly fun variant of the ""timed hits"" formula, the characters (especially Rose) were deep and likable, the story was interesting and compelling, and the scenery and graphics were amazing for the PS1. 

Next is probably *Super Mario RPG*, because the game is just a ridiculous amount of fun, with a great story and great characters in addition to fun gameplay and great music. Probably the last great SNES game, it really showed off what the system was capable of. 

Finally, I've got to mention *Grandia*. I'd heard good things, but was skeptical until I actually gave it a try. I was blown away by the characters, which are probably some of the best I've ever seen in an RPG. Also, this game gives you a sense of wonder and awe at the prospect of adventure like no other, and the excellent music plays a huge part in that.

Firekracker	52	5	155	"With that I don't mean which games or scenes you find particularly sad, I'm curious in the events which you guys found so disturbing they actually had an impact on you in Real Life. 

For example these scenes traumatized me a lot:

* Shadow's [suicide after the final battle](/spoiler) in FF VI. [And no, I don't mean his sacrifice on the floating continent, I mean him abandoning Interceptor and the others, and just staying in Kefka's collapsing tower.](/spoiler) I actually felt like crying and was depressed for the rest of the weekend.

* same goes for the ending movies of Secret of Mana and Lufia II

* Valkyrie Profile (the first part); The whole story about Celia, Aelia, Kashell, Grey and Lemia. The time everything came to an end during Grey's recruiting scene, my mum got into my room only to find a sobbing little kid in front of the TV. In hindsight I would rather she caught me watching porn.

* The Ending of Valkyrie Profile: Covenant of the Plume. [I had used the plume too often and got the C ending. I was angry to no end to have fallen to Hel's trickery. I actually got into a physical fight with an acquaintance over an unrelated issue, mainly because I still was so pissed.](/spoiler)

* Ok this seems very nerdy but in Dragon Age Origins [my character, although having a relationship with Leliana, married Anora to become king. In hindsight I was pretty upset with me making him choose power before true love, and I felt guilty for a few days and ever since every time I think about it. This feeling did not get better while playing Awakening.](/spoiler)

I'm trying to remember more and will edit, but I'm curious to know what affected you!

**EDIT: Wow, very interesting aspects you brought up until now! It's really great to see where people have had their personal tragedies in gaming history and how they comply (or do not comply) with own experiences. Thanks for sharing!**"	t5_2su0w	True
1373223415.0	1htchb	Any new/in-dev SNES-era RPGs that you know of?	TRIPLE_R	52	6	42	"Let me give this post some context - I absolutely LOVE RPGs from the SNES era. Not necessarily because of the graphics or the nostalgia (although these points are important), but because there was so much emphasis on exploration, character customization, side quests, mini-games which do not have a steep learning curve, deep leveling and sense of character progression and development, and really deep storylines. There wasn't a bunch of flashy 3D graphics to mask these qualities.

I have pretty much played all the RPGs on the actual SNES console, and loved almost all of them. I am currently finishing up Barkley's Shut Up and Jam Gaiden, which was made with some variant of RPG Maker, and I am loving every minute of it, even if the story is pretty out there.

My question is: does anyone know if there are any developers or companies (indie or otherwise), who are actively creating games that emulate this style of Japanese SNES-era RPGs? I feel like I am not the only one who would gladly pay upwards of 20$ or more a title for any game that was a CLONE of Final Fantasy IV for SNES. I'm talking, no innovative new features, no new leveling mechanics - just a new, deep and original storyline, and deep character progression.

I have trolled through the archives of RPG maker games, and haven't really seen anything that comes close to a studio quality title other than a few rare gems. I guess I just wish more game companies would realize that there is an ACTUAL MARKET of people just like me who would rather play these types of games, than current generation PS3 RPGs. 

If anyone has any input on SNES-era, SNES-style RPGs (I'm talking Lufia 2, Super Mario RPG, FFIV, etc), please point me in that direction. If you know of any way I can support or encourage game development studios to actively produce these kinds of titles, please let me know. Thanks!"	t5_2su0w	True

Thing is, it wasn't for the story, but rather for the leveling up.  I would literally play all of these games, completely skip the story, cutscenes etc. Just for my next chance to level up (I would get lost A LOT).

My cousin always thought I was crazy.. I mean my favorite part of the game was the part that seemed to be the most boring to people.  Am I just crazy? Or are there others that for some strange reason LOVE to level up, LOVE being the guy who is 20 levels higher than they are supposed to be..

Like in FF9 right when you hit those dragons for the first time, I grinded to level 90 or so, was overpowered before I even got to them, In FF7 I grinded 2 Master Materias for every character (2 Command, 2 Magic, etc.). To the point that I would have it so a normal attack would hit like 5 times, heal my HP and MP entirely and other cool combos using all of my materias to their full potentials.

My cousin has always been the one other person I know that enjoys RPG's as much as me, but he doesn't understand my problem in the slightest as he plays for the storyline.

Am I the only one..? One of the few? Am I the 1%?

**EDIT**: Wow.. 24 upvotes and 0 downvotes.. Even those of you who think I'm weird don't downvote.. This community is great, I'm used to so many assholes on the other subreddits!  Thanks guys :)

**EDIT 2**: It sounds like the majority of you guys are recommending the Disgaea series which I haven't really looked into much.  I have normally been turned away from Strategy RPG's like Final Fantasy Tactics though.  Never really enjoyed turn based RPG's but I guess I could give this series a shot.  If any of you can recommend some other games it would be greatly appreciated.

---

Just keep in mind:

* I LOVE level grinding
* Not a BIG fan of strategy RPG's (turn based)
* Will not turn away a game that has a goofy/stupid storyline (as gameplay/lvling up is more important to me)
* Will **NOT** play any type of **MMORP** like WoW, Runescape, etc.
* Currently play DotA and DOTA 2 as my main game (I like that it has RPG characteristics but also fast paced, I am looking for a game that isn't like an ONLINE type though, DotA is the only one I want for that, I am looking for a bored at home fun RPG that I can just play when I have some time here and there)

Top favorite games are:

    1. Final Fantasy Series

    2. Chrono Trigger

    3. Breath of Fire Series

    4. Earthbound Series

*Pretty much any other older game that has the same basic style as these.  Haven't really played any recent RPG's as I feel like they are just going for crazy graphics which is not something that I really even like.. I am more of an older style RPG player*

**EDIT 3**: Was going through a few of my old GameBoy Advance games the other day and was shocked at the levels I was..

[Breath of Fire](http://i.imgur.com/Zwi2Gh.jpg)

[Tales of Phantasia](http://i.imgur.com/UX8Iih.jpg)

Keep in mind that in some of these games like in the first Golden Sun, even Level 30 is actually pretty high, same with Golden Sun II.  You are able to beat the game easily at like level 25 etc.

I only posted pictures of games with at least 20 hours of play, most of them are up there in the 50-60 hours though (and for a GBA game, that's a lot of time looking at a tiny screen)

Kinda wish I could grab my FF7 save though, that one is quite ridiculous (2 master commands, magic, etc. on each person, everyone level 99, etc.).  I would have to throw my ISO on my PSP though which is kind of a pain, if people request it and are that curious then I'll do it, but currently I have put enough work into this post :P"	t5_2su0w	True

Does anyone feel they should return as much as I do?

As for immersion, The World Ends with you came out a year after I went to Japan. Since I was actually in Shibuya, I could point out landmarks and say ""hey, I've been there!"". It felt like my world was recreated in a game. That made the game go from amazing to my favorite of all time. As such, I also love modern day games (Persona 3/4, Devil survivor).

So I'm playing through again, and I was finishing up chapter 2.  Came out of the Nashkel Mines, and there's the all-woman assassin squad.  I dropped Hold Person on them, and got 2 held.  While the other 5 characters worked on the two mobile assassins, I set Minsc the task of taking out the two held assassins.  About the time we got one of the mobile ones down, Minsc has killed them both.

While looting, I had to juggle some inventory to make room, and noticed Minsc had a broken weapon.  I'm like, ""Where'd he get that?""  It was his 2-handed sword.  I was like, ""Lucky me, he killed them then his sword broke.""   But I checked the auto-save from when they left the mines.  His sword was broken already at that time.  He killed those two assassins with his fists.  ""You point, I punch,"" indeed.

I absolutely think this is the best rpg of this gen, and thats coming from a guy who owns xenoblade (honestly after all the INSANE hype I read on reddit/other shit I was expecting something... a bit more. Don't get me wrong I loved the game but something was.. missing maybe? I'm not positive yet. Anyways...). I am loving the pokemon nostalgia factor, the Ghibli nostalgia and little hidden refrences to Ghibli works. 

I'm not going to lie though right off the bat I was off put by the kiddie-ness of the game. Things like the general feel, the hand holding, impending lack of swearing/violence/explosions. But then (early game spoiler) [.. his mom dies? Whaaaa? Its a straight up full on death by heart attack too. Shes not just imprisoned in an ice block or something, you see her grasp her chest, fall, and freakin die! After this I knew we were in for a Ghibli level story, on the same level with their movies I continue to watch and love into my adult years.](/spoiler). The environments fucking blew me off my bed and out the window. I knew I was getting into some gorgeous shit, but daaaaamn. 

Now I know its not the perfect and game, and I'm not saying it is. I'm not some blinded-by-my-own-ignorance fanboy either, and granted yes some of my initial hype will slowly dry and fall off. The story can get slightly cliche at times, but 99.9987% of the time it is mystifying, hilarious, and entertaining just like almost all my favorite works by Ghibli and Level-5.

I'm currently playing Tales of Vesperia Monday through Thursday each week til I'm finished with it. It's my first time through the game, but I believe I'm a bit over halfway through the game now. After I finish it, I'm going to start playing Persona 4 on those days! Stream starts at 9pm EST each night. Outside of that I'll also stream fighting games and other assorted things on no particular schedule during the day and on weekends mostly if you're interested in that.

I'll be giving away several steam keys each night to viewers and followers on my stream. Exactly when and how might change a little each night, but watching and following is your best way to have a shot of winning. For tonight, I'll give away 1 key to a random viewer during the stream, and another 2 keys afterward to random new followers if I get above 130 total followers by the end of tonight :)

Any support I can get for my stream is greatly appreciated, and any suggestions for how to improve it or where to promote it would be extremely helpful too.

Having sat down and actually played the game over these past few days, I can say that the only thing I really didn't like about the model was the gold cap.  That doesn't have anything to do with the game itself, it just offends me that EA would chop the feet off of its F2P model right at the start.

Bottom line is this: If you liked KOTOR 1 or 2 or Mass Effect or Dragon Age or any other Bioware game, or just Star Wars in general, give the game a shot.  Bar none the best F2P MMO experience I've had ever*.

If I could sway the conversation a little to the frequency of posts that would help.  Do we allow 1 post per game, 2 posts per game (1 at the beginning and 1 with 24 hours left), or no restrictions at all?

------

Hey guys and gals, mod VA1N here to open up a discussion about something that we have been seeing a lot of recently - Kickstarter links.  Kickstarter has been a great force for good recently in the video game world with games that would never reach funding finding life through crowd donations.  If you aren't familiar with what kickstarter is, visit kickstarter.com and check it out, it's pretty near.

What this post hopes to accomplish is to open up a discussion with you guys, the loyal subscribers of rpg_gamers, to see if we should allow links directly to Kickstarter game donation pages.  These are the pages where the devs are showing the game in the hopes of getting donations which you provide on the same page.

The links do offer good insight into upcoming games but to play devil's advocate, the links can and have been gamed in the past.  I've seen Kickstarter devs post ""visit /r/rpg_gamers and upvote our post..."" to get a high upvote count to use a sort of advertising campaign.  This doesn't just happen on our subreddit, but on others as well.

We (the mods) have talked about this in private but we want to see what you guys think before making any sort of decision.  And this isn't a black/white issue - do we only allow posts talking about Kickstarters but not linking directly to the page?  Maybe we just stay vigilant to look for gaming of the subreddit and block offending users only?  Or do we leave everything as is.  Let us know what you think.

(just the name would suffice)

The game I played was around more than 8 years back when you bought game cds and they came with lots of demos and games.

The game was like this:

* The game has similar mechanics to Dungeon and dragon board game. Its is a rpg elements with dice. The ingame view is as of heroes of might and magic 3 or disciples 2.

* You can hire mercenaries or heroes (not sure) from village or town.

* When you battle monsters in dungeons , the battlefield is similar (but not same) to heroes of might and magic series game but the attack and damage is determined by a DICE ROLL. For example you roll the dice if it comes 7 it is multiplied to your attack and damage is done to enemy based on that , same for the enemies. Some items make your threshold of rolling dice greater than a particular number. The game had good inventory system.

* **DICE ROLL** and the old style graphics were what distinguishes it from other games.

Ive been looking for this game for long time and any help will be appreciated. (Ive tried Gamespot/IGN and other mumbo jumbo formus , now only hope is if someone who has played the game)

The graphics are similar to Heroes of might and magic 3 and I used to play games like Dink smallwood when I played this.

The map is somewhat like this but I think better than this ...
http://image.gamespotcdn.net/gamespot/images/screenshots/gs/strategy/herochron/herochron_790screen003.jpg

* ITs a PC windows game
* We donot have a full army but few heroes or maybe one at a time.
* we travel over map to locations by clicking to a location with mouse and hero comes ther (not sure if this was controlled by dice).
* D&amp;D board games relate so much with the game.
I can also remember some dice from these in the game https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dice_(typical_role_playing_game_dice).jpg

I've been playing Breath of Fire III again...and just want...that...just repackaged...over and over and over. Is there anything that fits along these routes? The main problem is that I've rarely found an Indie game which didn't have clunky battle mechanics or an insanely bland story so I kinda screw myself out of several potential games.
Anyway! What makes me the most depressed is that if you do a search of 'rpg, -action, -mmo' you knock out basically everything new.

What i mean by that: there are numerous RPGs out there which try to emulate console-controllers on the touchscreen (Zenonia for example). I can't stand that. If i want to play such a game, i will do this on a handheld.

It seems RPGs which are actually suited for touch controls are very rare.

Examples of games which work are Final Fantasy Tactics (the menu interaction is a bit fiddly, but it's not real-time so i'm fine with that) and 10,000,000.

Of course there are 37 million puzzle quest clones out there, but 99,99% of them are garbage.

I'm not very far into the game yet, I've just defeated the Biting Lizard and have learned ice magic. 
I'm disappointed with the battle system, although I've enjoyed other games with real time battling like, A Link to The Past, I don't find this to be as good. I find it a bit frustrating having multiple characters, which you can't all control. I haven't really figured out how to change the settings on Purim's or Popoie's action grids which is part of the problem. 
I seem to be getting stuck. Not a lot is explained or maybe I'm just really bad at it.. There doesn't seem to be a map yet although there are signs. Items/equipment in shops aren't given descriptions. It isn't really explained how to use magic. I know older games can be like this, and usually it doesn't bother me. But so far I don't understand the hype about this game Compared to other games like, Chrono Trigger or the Mother series. I'm definitely going to continue with this game but I'd be nice to hear some opinions or maybe advice?   


Update:
Thanks for all the responses it's given me a much clearer understanding of the game.
Also, I'm definitely going to try out multiplayer.

Ok, two things:

* He talks about how remaking a game faithful to the original would be too boring and stifle his creativity bla bla bla. Thing is, they've released remakes and enhanced ports of almost every FF by now and this hasn't really been an issue before. Why the fuck would this be a problem now with the *one* game that so many fans are so emotionally attached to?

* I'd probably be in the minority here, but as a massive FFVII fan, I actually wouldn't mind radical changes to the game in the interest of a fresh, new and interesting perspective and take on a universe so familiar to us. *However,* if and only if this is done at the hands of a competent team. I don't think SE can handle that level of freedom (I've personally been severely let down by every FF after FFX), so I'd rather they not get to be ""creative"" and ruin the freaking game.

We got into a heated discussion and it ended with two theories. Sephiroth is either a figment of Cloud's imagination and/or he's immortal.
Now, in FF7 it is shown that Cloud killed Sephiroth at the Nibelheim reactor by throwing him into the Mako. Assuming he is now dead, did his body travel through the lifestream and end up at the Northern Crater or did Shinra transport his mako-cacooned body there? Either way dead Seph is at the crater pretty much the whole time. So who is this other Sephiroth that appears before Cloud? In one theory you could say due to the jenova cells/mako infusion that Cloud is able to see Sephiroth but how do the other party members see him? Who is this ghostly Seph that seems to teleport around? If he indeed is a hallucination that somehow other party members can see, how is he able to kill the president/Aries etc? The story shows that Cloud is subconciously being led by the fake Seph to deliver the Black materia to the real Seph. Has it always been Cloud commiting the murders while involutarily being controlled by Jenova/Seph? The story does show Cloud being a ""puppet"" throughout. If the fake Seph can kill, can he not just transport Black materia himself? 
Also whats the deal with ""men in black capes""?
The theory which i support is that Sephiroth is now and forever immortal. Once he died he became part of the lifestream and can now appear anywhere and live forever even when defeated. This makes sense since Cloud has been showered in mako so the exposure may have messed with his mind. In FF7 advent children, Sephiroth returns temporarily proving that he cant be properly killed since jenova cells in combination with a susceptible body can bring him back. His apparant out of body appearance could be a clone made from mako.

I'm going mage, gotten up to level 5 by chatting with Dak'Kon.

Some specific concerns of mine:

Should I care much about money?  I was looking at buying a +wis tatoo to hold me over until I get permanent boosts later.

I've heard the game is tough if you run with a 6 person party due to exp split.  Any truth to that?  I wouldn't mind running with just 4, as it's easier to control.  All the party members seem so fun though.

Can I get to other zones early (clerk's ward, lower ward etc.) early?  It would be nice to dart around and grab all the stat boosts so I can be more relaxed about the game.

As I understand it there's really no downside to joining factions so I should milk the Dusties for their experience.

1361469052.0	18yr94	A few days ago, I asked for advice on how to get past a freezing bug in Grandia on my PSP. Here's a short explanation on how to transfer saves from the PSP Go to ePSXe and vice-versa.	hairybalkan	36	5	7	"Ok, this will be short, since I'm a bit short for time here. I'll try to elaborate further later on, maybe even write up a general guide.

First of all, i needed to find the saves. On my PSP Go, they were in 

* PSP\SAVEDATA\SCUS94457

It depends on the game ID, but this one was mine. I think it's easiest to just sort by date and figure it out that way. There's also an icon inside the folder which can help you figure it out. The two memory cards for the save were

* SCEVMC0.VMP
* SCEVMC1.VMP

I downloaded [MemCardRex 1.6](http://shendosoft.blogspot.com/2012/07/memcardrex-16-released.html), which is a save ""editor"" for various Sony save game formats. With that one, all I needed to do was to open the first memory card in one tab of the app and one of the ePSXe memory cards in the other tab, then copy the required save block from one to the other and save the file. The two ePSXe memory cards are located in the **memcards** folder of the emulator folder and are called

* epsxe000.mcr
* epsxe001.mcr

If they aren't there, you need to run the emulator once and run either a game or the bios so they get created.

With that, you can now continue playing the game on the emulator. If you're like me, however, and prefer it portable, you'll probably want to also transfer the save back to the PSP. Sadly, MemCardRex doesn't support saving to the PSP format, only reading from it. If you have a PS3, you can save to that format and then transfer the save to your PSP, I think that's possible. However, I don't so I needed something else.

What I did was to install the CWCheat plugin. For that, you need a hacked firmware on your PSP. There are guides out there on how to install a plugin, so I'll skip that. In any case, the plugin didn't work for me, so I had to find a specific version of the plugin. Here's both versions:

* [CW Cheat Official 2.3](http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?4vcbzp42dotgaob) - Didn't work for my Go
* [CW Cheat PSP Go 2.3](http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?s93cc212x133ab4) - This one worked for me

I got my ePSXe memory card file (extension .mcr) and copied it to my PSPGo in the folder

* seplugins/cwcheat/mc

I then renamed it to 

* SCUS_94457-0

And also made a copy called

* SCUS94457-0

I'm not sure which of this is the proper naming scheme, but I'm more leaning towards the first one. In any case, it needs to be named this way so the plugin can recognize it as a potential save import for Grandia. For another game, you need to name it after that other game's ID.

Once I got it all ready, I ran the game and got to the title screen. I then held the select button for a few seconds, which caused the cwcheat menu to appear. From there, I picked ""manage memory cards"" and then loaded up my card file for import. It only took a second and I was able to load up my ePSXe game from my PSP. When I loaded it up, i immediately went back to the save point and saved again, just in case, but I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Also, here's an article on my blog, where I also have a few, probably not very useful screenshots with parts of the process.

* [Blogging Games - Transfering Grandia Saves From the PSP to ePSXe and back](http://addictedgamewise.com/grandia-5-to-the-pc-and-back-again-the-twin-towers-freeze/).

The entire guide is basically here, so please don't consider this a plug. There's no need to go there if you got everything here."	t5_2su0w	True

I still remember sitting with my brother when we were 7 and 5, playing through FF1 and barely understanding half of what we were doing.  Buying 99 potions ONE AT A TIME. :)  We moved on to others, and games like FF3 and Chrono Trigger and the Suikodens were some of our favorites.  One of the last JRPG type games I played was FF: Tactics, which I loved, and had an incredible plot.

Fast forward years, and for some reason I didn't play many of them.  Lately, I've had a hankering, and have tried quite a few of the newer ones that people recommend, and frankly, I can't fucking stand the plots of most of them.  

Eternal Sonata, for example, was so kiddy and trite and cutesy that it didn't feel like anything was at stake.  

Lost Odyssey wasn't horrible, but the acting and characterization was fucking atrocious...The badguy they introduce early is cheesy as shit, the part where the Mom dies and the kids are crying is so overdone and unsubtle that it killed it, and I gave up the game when you get to the second act and the giant boobed girl falling out of her dress for no reason shows up (I think she was a queen or something). (To be fair, the story parts that talked about his life were moving and incredible...Why couldn't the game be more like that?)

And Oh my God, what did they DO to Final Fantasy?  I tired 13, and holy shit, a few hours in, the fourth time what's his ass yells ""I'm the HERO!"" I wanted to cut out my fucking brain to forget the melodramatic retardation I'd just seen. :(

Maybe this ties into the anime mindset that a lot of JRPG's have these days?   I've tried watching a lot of anime, but most of it is just so unsubtle and lacking nuance, so melodramatic (I keep using that word, can't think of a better one) that it's just stupid.  There ARE some good ones, and some I've loved, so don't jump up my butt about it...Just saying that the average anime I've seen is really over the top and bombastic and even the serious ones just lack plot subtlty.  Is this why today's JRPG's are like this?

So, folks, PLEASE.  I'm looking for good, serious, hell even funny JRPGS.  I love the combat, the upgrade systems, everything about them, but the plots of the ones I've played have been terrible and I don't know where to turn.  I'm interested in the ""Tales of"" series, but I don't want to get burned again before I get some opinions.  I want something with the adult nature and complexity of FF3 without some douchebag yelling about being THE HERO! over and over.  lol

Final Fantasy 2,
Secret of Mana ,
Secret of Evermore,
7th Saga,
Final Fantasy 3,
Eathbound,
Super Mario RPG,
Tales of Phantasia,
Chrono Trigger,
Illusion of Gaia,
The lufia series ,
Breath of fire.

Probably missing a few I can't remember.

Ps1- I feel this is when RPG's took off.  Nothing else has compared to them.

FF7,
FF8,
FF9,
Chrono Cross,
Xenogears,
Breath of fire 3 and 4,
Grandia,
Tales of Destiny 1 and 2 ,
Wild arms (didn't like the 2nd but I hear everyone else does).
Thousand Arms,
Azure Dream,
Legend of Dragoon.

I know I missed a few but it's a start.

I really started to lose touch with RPGs after that. I played FF12 which I liked but the new grandia was horrible.  Only a few I can really say I like.

1345840308.0	yrtu3	Going to pick up a couplse PS2 RPGs this weekend. What should I consider?	archzinno	36	6	73	"Hey folks. I'm just looking for some suggestions for games that I may have not played yet. I have quite a few I already have, but as for the games that were released post PS3 I haven't really played any. I'm talking about stuff like Suikoden V and Persona 4. Those 2 are on my list, as well as FFXII simply because I never did finish it.

So r/rpg_gamers, what other suggestions, common or uncommon, would you have for a seasoned rpgamer who may have missed out on a good PS2 RPG?

EDIT: Sorry for borking the title.

EDIT2: Apologies for responding late to everyone. I went to work out after the post and found out I had to work midnight shift after working a full day already so I took a nap. Looks like I'll be picking games up tomorrow. Already got 3-4 more good suggestions, thanks!

EDIT3: Thanks for all the great suggestions. I've been in an RPG lull so I figured I would poll the community for some good titles that may have slipped by. It's hard to find quality RPGs I may have not yet played, I've got so many I've gone through, ranging all the way back to the NES. I really appreciate everyone's help."	t5_2su0w	True

1342082684.0	wfmck	Favorite RPG protagonists?	ginja_ninja	31	2	82	"I'm replaying the Witcher 2 and think Geralt of Rivia is probably mine. He's got that somewhat stereotypical stoic, morally-ambiguous, ""nobody's side but my own"" thing going on, but he's also got plenty of other characteristics that flesh him out and make him likeable. He's got a dry sense of humor, friends that he genuinely cares about, and he flat out loves to bang wenches. I think it says a lot that the Witcher games are games where you can choose dialogue options and make your own decisions, but Geralt still maintains a fairly consistent character no matter your choices. It's a lot different than Bioware games where your character is a complete blank slate that is 100% what you want them to be.

Are there any other games with protagonists on the same level as Geralt? I'd say games where you completely shape your character like Bioware ones shouldn't count. Who are your favorite distinctly-characterized ones?"	t5_2su0w	True

1333140431.0	rlghl	inExile to team up with Obsidian to complete Wasteland 2 if kickstarter hits $2.1 million! It's like Black Isle all over again!	Trevellian	35	8	2	"You can take this any way you want, some people have their reservations about Obsidian given their recent track record, but I'm extremely stoked about this news! Here's the update:

&gt; We have announced a major piece of good news today that inXile has reached an agreement with Obsidian for potential design assistance for Wasteland 2. What that means is that Obsidian’s Chief Creative Officer, Chris Avellone, is going to work with our team on the design and writing of the game!  It is important to note that we say ""potential"" as they will come aboard assuming we hit $2.1 million in funding. The good news is that we have already seen a spike in just the few hours since this was announced in a press release this morning.

&gt; For those of you who don't know who Obsidian or Chris Avellone are, they are the bulk of the brains who worked on Fallout 1&amp;2, Icewind Dale and Planescape Torment when I was back at Interplay. More of the band is back together to make sure we bring you a fantastic RPG. Chris is going to help push the density and literary content of the game.

&gt; The original Wasteland was an important game to Chris as he recently stated, ""Wasteland is one of my favorite RPGs of all time, and when Brian asked if I wanted to work on the sequel, I jumped at the chance. While I've worked on Fallout 2 and Fallout: New Vegas, getting the chance to work on the spiritual predecessor to the Fallout franchise is a honor."" 

&gt; While the programming work will remain with us here at inXile, we are looking to use a host of tools that Obsidian has created which will help us get assets into the game faster. The faster we can implement and iterate on content, the deeper the game and the more varied choices the gamers can make.

&gt; That’s more good news for all of you that put your faith in us.

Plenty of junk too, obviously, but I'm interested in games with a lot of significant non-junk.

By contrast, I would argue that games like Diablo and Torchlight, while heavy on looting, restrict you to either equipping an item or selling it, rendering all but those items specific to your class nothing more than potentially-valuable paperweights/doorstops.

I also prefer games where your equipment isn't totally obsolete barely half an hour after you claim it from a fallen monster's body in the aftermath of a grueling and bloody battle.

Any suggestions for a game that meets one or all of these criteria would be greatly appreciated.  I have to say that I do like the crafting and AH systems in the MMOs I've played, but in this case I'm looking for single-player games.

1369798995.0	1f8xcs	An MMO-like RPG experience in a single player?	mogifax	32	5	48	"I've played WoW, but quit raiding after a while because it turned into a part-time job and a grind.  Played Rift, quit for the same reason.  I like MMOs, but hate the endgame ""*raid at 6pm server time on Thu, Sun*"" crap.  I love Fallout, Diablo, The Elder Scrolls, but after a while the single player experience becomes a lonely bummer -- no one to share your progress with.

Is there a modern-ish game out there that combines the freedom and leveling experience of a single player with a good community of a MMO/multiplayer, but without the nagging feeling of never being able to catch up to the latest raiding tier set?  Maybe something like Fallout 3 with a true RPG-style skill tree and occasional players you'd run into in the wild?  Or maybe an MMO that I could log into casually and not feel the pressure to grind the dailies and not be worse than other players?

I realize it's a very specific and probably impossible request, but doesn't hurt to ask, right?  Thanks!

1359021430.0	176lji	Finished Infinite Undiscovery today.	livinglitch	36	6	22	"Over all, Id say its a 3 and a half star game, Id give it 4 stars but theres a few parts near the end that are tedious and frustrating more then just a challenge to gamers. It took me about 18 hours of played time to finish the game. This does not include the times Ive had to restart for different reasons. The combat is real time on the main map like Final Fantasy XII rather then turned based in its own world like most Final Fantasy games. The game allows for crafting items rather then buying them, a feature I should have used a bit more to save money but I didnt. The AI is mostly competent in what it does within a few exceptions. It features a cast of about 16-20 characters to bring to your group. At several different points through out the game The Force, as your group is called, splits off into 3 groups. Occasionally they will follow you and work beside you, other times you can see them running through different parts of the dungeon. Regardless of whos fighting, every member gets some experience from the fight. There was one character I never used but he was able to keep up with the main characters level within reason. The combat system rewards you for combos. If you can hit air combos you get bonus exp. Combos made while the enemies laying on the ground restore your health and mana.

Its currently $8 used, $15 new at gamestop and for 18 hours thats a great price provided you can make it through the first 2 hours of gameplay which is mostly due in part to the slow pacing then anything else. I plan on doing a video review for it soon.

If you enjoyed Hellgate London, come back, it will be right up your alley.	sudin	33	5	15	"Hello, I would like to humbly call fellow gamers' attention to the excellent FPS/3rd person game known as Hellgate Global, which has made a nice comeback since this summer but is unfortunately still not widely known. It is considered an action-RPG MMO, with points to spend on stats and skill, so I figured there might be some interest in it here as well.

I am sure many of you have heard of Hellgate: London and the horrible failure which beset it after the developers at Flagship messed up and it was ultimately shut down. Hellgate was picked up by Hanbitsoft and is currently operated by T3 Entertainment since the June beta. The game is available to both US and EU players and is free to play with a purchasable ticket system as a way for T3 to make money (stuff like bigger inventory, buffs, convenience and cosmetic items).

General Info

- 3 castes, broken down to 6 six classes: Templar (Guardian (tank), Blademaster (melee damage)), Cabalist (Summoner (minion damage), Evoker (spell damage)) and Hunter (Marksman (ranged damege), Engineer (utility, minion tank/damage)

- 5 Character slots available for free players, current maximum level is 55, with Ranks earned at level cap

- A shattered and infested, post-apocalyptic world set in 2038, filled with demons, vile beasts, **hordes of zombies**, necros and spectrals

- GUNS and SWORDS, ie. ranged combat, caster combat and melee combat

- Heavily randomized item system, with dozens of prefixes and suffixes (think Diablo 2)

- 6 types of mods to customize weapons with: Relics, Ammos, Fuels, Rockets, Techs and Batteries

- 7 types of item qualities: General, Enhanced, Rare, Legendary, Unique, Mythic and Set 

- Global, party and guild chat system, friends/ignore list, server-wide marketplace (think Auction House from any MMO)

- In-game mail system (this lets you send items to your other characters), shared storage (this is a premium feature)

- Arenas, which allow PVP battles to be fought

- 5 areas to play in, including the expansions developed by Flagship Studios: London (classic zone), Stonehenge, 2nd Attack, The Abyss and Tokyo, the latest expansion

- **100% Free to play gameplay**, with tickets that let you buy extended expansion gameplay (Acts 3-5 to Abyss), these appear as in-game items that can be purchased for in-game money (~400,000 Palladium for Act 3+, ~300,000 for Tokyo),  This ticket is a 1 time purchase and unlocks apply to one whole account, ie. all the game content can be bought with ingame money

And of course: [**the Hellgate subreddit**](http://www.reddit.com/r/hellgate/new/), please feel free to join if you like/play the game.

For installation, I heavily recommend grabbing the torrent [from the official download page](http://hellgate.t3fun.com/Data/Download.aspx), instead of using the default installer, which can be a hassle as the installation consists of 3x ~2GB files and unfortunately the downloader isn't the best one out there.

1360364807.0	185sni	Class of Heroes 2 UMD + PSN code sign-up	ramo200	37	12	7	"Class of Heroes 2 is coming to PSN very soon but before it does, Gaijinworks (headed by former president of Working Designs, Victor Ireland) wants to make one last attempt at providing a physical UMD box copy of CoH2 for the fans out there. There was a Kickstarter for the game to have the Working Designs deluxe package treatment but it failed. This one will just be a plain vanilla physical version of CoH2 (with UMD game, cover art, and a color manual) along with a PSN code for anyone who owns a Vita or just like digital downloads. It'll be $34.99 shipped (add $10 if you need international shipping).

Not only will this benefit fans of Class of Heroes who want a physical copy, but also any PSP/Vita owners who want to play great PSP games that are currently stuck in Japan. If this proves to be successful, it'll give Gaijinworks (and perhaps other publishing companies that are watching this) a bit more confidence on seeking out these gems and stick to this route.

Sign-ups can be made over at www.gaijinworks.com. 2,500 copies is the total amount needed for the campaign to be a success and so far, people have signed up for a total amount of 1,850 copies. Victor has stated this campaign will last about 5 more days. He also made a thread at r/gaming (http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/185avi/psp_physicaldigital_combo_signup_for_class_of/) if you have any questions for him. Thanks!

UPDATE: Gaijinworks latest tweet (https://twitter.com/gaijin4life/status/300389073858723840) states that more than 2,000 people signed up.

UPDATE #2: The weekend was very slow but now we are up to 2,200 sign-ups (https://twitter.com/gaijin4life/status/301037324832235520). 

UPDATE #3: The latest tweet confirms the sign-up count is past 2,300 (https://twitter.com/gaijin4life/status/301204714962436096). 

UPDATE #4: The sign-up has crossed the 2,400 mark (https://twitter.com/gaijin4life/status/301450510723076097). Only 100 more people to sign up in the next 36 hours. Let's do it folks! 

UPDATE #5: The campaign is a success! The preorder links to buy Class of Heroes 2 will be sent to the all the e-mails used to sign up. Thanks to everyone who supported this gallant effort!

Keep signing up so you can get a link for preorder. Don't forget to verify your e-mail address once you finished signing up on their website. This campaign will conclude Thursday, February 14th."	t5_2su0w	True

The game begins with everyone in the village is dead. Even the buildings are gone. You then enter a dungeon and slay monsters. At key points in the dungeon there are buttons you can walk on. Each button ""resurrects"" a villager and the building they lived in.

Periodically you return to the surface, get more supplies, get quests, etc. By the end of the game the village is restored whole.

There may be multiple villages, each in the same ""destroyed until you resurrect them"" state. I also recall ridding a log raft on rivers if that helps.

1335280677.0	sq1sz	Questions about Chrono Trigger iOS.	heymrk	35	9	45	"*Self post, so no karma.*

The last few weeks I've been playing through *Final Fantasy* (the original) on iOS. I think as ports go, it's the best one I've ever played. Even better than Origins. Well, other than the minor music bug.

Anyway, I'm about to beat it, so I was considering getting *Chrono Trigger*, as it is on sale in the App Store for $10.

I've played it on the SNES and the PSX, and I had a few questions about the iOS version.

I know it's a port of the DS version, but I'm curious if there's still load lag. You know, how it took so long for the menus and battles to open?

Also, how does getting the Chrono clone work in this version?

Is it entirely like the DS version (obviously not with two screens), where the battle with Time Devourer completely retcons out *Chrono Cross*? Does it have all those extras, basically?

Anything else I need to know about it?

EDIT: I just spent the last 10 minutes reading reviews of this port. Most of the reviews are skewed because it's *fucking Chrono Trigger,* but I saw a consistent pattern emerge from those who took the time to critique **the app itself.**

Either the game doesn't load at all, the music doesn't work or the controls are borked. I keep seeing consistently that there is no d-pad or confirmation like in the *Final Fantasy* titles, which can make places like Death Peak a pain in the ass.

After my research, I do not feel like Chrono Trigger for the iPhone is a good investment, even for $10. *An awesome game in its own right,* but I think I'll be pulling out the SNES on this one.

I'll probably just download FF2 instead."	t5_2su0w	True

I want the skill system to be more than rudementary. Like put a point in Ranged if you use a bow is not what im after. There should be synergies several tech paths and complexity (But not for complexities sake). Im after strong character developement in the skill system, possible with synergies in the item system.

I was born in the 80's and i loved games like, Lufia, FFVI, FFVII, Seiken Denetsu 3, Chrono trigger. Those old school games is something i have played to death so im looking for games outside of SNES and PSX.

I own no last gen consoles, so either its PSX-PS2 era(read can be emulated, only after i acquire the game physically ofc) or a PC game.

Don't forget the story...It should be good, the music aswell. I have tried some games made with RPG Maker, while im certain some  that are good exist, the horrendous writing and plot is very off putting in many of these.

So is there a new game, or old, that fit this description? Preferably newer, is there something on the horizon for us that liked non-dumbed down RPGs from 80'-90's?

And please. I am not out to flame anyone that may like what i do not like. Nor am i saying, and this is important, that any of the FF games i listed are the best and you are wrong if you think another one is best. ;)

New RPG-element-like-games i liked: Fallout 3, All elder scrolls. And i just finished legend of grimrock. 

But please, if possible, keep it to the old school, turn based(which possible can be turned off, like in some FFs) with a party and random encouters games  if possible. But im open to suggestions.

More games i played: Neverwinter(s), Diablo series, Baldurs gate, The Fables

Edit: Oh, i own a wii and have played Last story, Xenoblade and i have played all Zeldas that arent on a handheld dev.

Edit2: Yes im difficult ;)

I just got a Wii (I know, I know welcome to ten years ago.) but my most recent systems were my N64, Game Cube, PS1, and DS. I also have a SNES hooked up to my TV. I still use them all, but I'm wanting to play more modern games. Eventually I'll get a Xbox 360 or PS3 (or even a PS2 would be a step up.) But for now. I simply must play every Zelda title first and foremost gaming priority. But I'd like to know some RPGs other than Zelda. I also am getting Okami (which I've played before and love.) and the guy at Gamestop kinda sold me on the idea of getting Epic Mickey. Suggestions please? I'd hate to waste money.  (although I can return purchases to Gamestop within 7 days for a full return.)

I'm a classic Gamer when it comes to RPGs, I play and love all Final fantasy titles (except Mystic quest... no love.), Suikoden 2, Breath of Fire 1 through 4... I even actually did kind of like Quest 64 though it gets neg reviews out the ass. (I rented so I used a game genie for the fuck of it.) And I love all of the Fallout titles.

BruceLeesDad	27	2	37	By that i mean, older RPGs had one character for each job such as a mage or healer. Newer RPGs such as FFXIII have flexibility in jobs. Personally I prefer the dedicated style; there's just something that gives each character their own charm and personality that sometimes fits with the story too, FFXI did this well with Vivi, Steiner etc. The fill-all-roles type gets boring and sometimes weird... a scrawny, child character holding a staff dealing massive physical damage just seems out of place.	t5_2su0w	True

My question is: What game would you consider the beginning of the ""Modern RPG"" era, and at which point does a game become a ""classic?""

This is merely a question of opinions, I already have formulated my own answer.

EDIT: **WOW** huge response on this one.
I personally believe that the time between FF7 and Xenogears was the shift to the modern storytelling we have today. Though FF7 featured the same archaic battle style re-hashed numerous times, it also developed storytelling with gorgeous cut-scenes as opposed to almost entirely with text. Xenogears was also fond of the cutscene (maybe a little too much so), but it also developed multiple battle systems for one game, in addition to a storyline that is second-to-none.


This, I think, is where we start to see developers stretch out in terms of how they approach the genre. Most games at that point were basically point-and-click adventures with a linear story. The early 00's saw a surge in games with varying types of storytelling such as Chrono Cross (with it's choice based plot) and Elder Scrolls: Morrowind (with it's open-world play-style)."	t5_2su0w	True

Priceless721	34	11	12	"I have always been a big fan of using the original devices to play older games.  Even recently I finally threw away my old Sony Trinitron Cabinet 27"" just for playing my old 80's and 90's pre HD games.  But in the case of purchasing prohibitively expensive carts or buying a New Wii U to get a copy of Earthbound I decided to Emulate this time around.  I sold the Earthbound SNES Cart from my childhood for 30 dollars about 15 years ago.  Yesterday(Sunday) was the day.  I got up early and turned on a marathon of older South Park and got in my [Forever Lazy](http://i.imgur.com/Z071qhs.jpg)   

I used a Wireless Xbox 360 controller on my computer running an emulator.  The only ""cheat"" I used was Turbo speed at lowest setting. 

Long Story short Ness is over Level 60 at this point and I had a great day reliving a game from my childhood.  A little past the Kraken at this point in the game.  I really enjoyed grinding and trying to get some good drops.  Way more money on this playthrough, about 150k at this point with no effort.

1362178029.0	19ho5o	Rpg overload.  Need help!	Devilman1	25	2	36	"New to reddit and just found this gold mine of a subreddit!  I need some help trying to figure out what to play because I've seen so many recommendations that I'm not sure which would be good for me so here's more info on my tastes than you're probably looking for:

My favorites are DQ8, ni no kuni by far.  I love RPGs with party management systems and deep customization. 

I love good combat systems, item and character customization, alchemy/crafting, big worlds, grinding, and mostly dungeon crawling.   Things that aren't important to me surprisingly are story and music.  I'll pick up a good book if I wanted to spend my entire game reading lore, background, etc. admittedly in dq8 and NNK, I did get sucked into the story and music despite not usually paying attention. Maybe I would like other level 5 games like white knight chronical?

People say persona is the greatest but I don't really want to relive high school in a game. I tend to eliminate games quickly due to aspects like that but realized after NNK, I could be missing out on some great games because of my dislike of anime type graphics. 

I've played all the skyrims, dragon age, demon/dark souls and liked them but not to the degree I liked dq8. 

I've got pretty much every system and have looked at all the recommendations from the community (xenoblade/tales/star ocean and on and on)  My problem is I'm not sure which are recommended for great story and music, which I don't care about, and which are good for the reasons I do.  Hopefully that made sense!  I'd really appreciate some sort of breakdown on WHY each series is so great to limit my search!

Some additional past gaming info.  Played and liked all the FF stuff, have great gaming pc, played tons of mmos, haven't played the whitcher series.

I could never get into the fallout/mass effect type series either. Guess I prefer the non future/scifi RPGs. Also don't really like srpg games either.  Doesn't matter if its turn based or not but slightly prefer it.

Thanks again and sorry for the length. I just wanted to be as specific as possible about my tastes. "	t5_2su0w	True

Whenever I play any game, I always opt for the pet classes.  Recently I've been playing Torchlight 2 and it has whet my appetite for pet class RPGs.

Does anyone have any suggestions for RPGs featuring pets/pet classes?  I especially like games where you can specialize/focus on building up your pet or pet skills to the point that the Pet or Pets can do most of the work for you.

My major issue with Torchlight 2 pets for the Engineer class is that the summonable gun pet only lasts 1 minute.  I prefer games where the pets are constant companions.

A few things really stood out to me about this game, and here they are, in respective order:

* Storyline - Very lengthy game, with a rich storyline and great character development. 
* Gameplay - Excellent battle system which kind of works like FF12 did, but with a few more tweaks to make things really interesting. Tons of unique enemies are in the game, located in all different zones, and in most cases can easily rape you unless you do some grinding.
* Exploration - The world(s) in Xenoblade are enormous, allowing you to have free rein to just about anywhere, and you can fast travel to specific zones, so backtracking isn't required (that would take forever).

If you've got a FFT disc lying around, and a PC that can run any of the modern emulators, you can make an ISO using your disc and have all kinds of nostalgic fun using the tools on this site.

Just as an example: I have a custom ISO where Ramza's jobs in later chapters include sword skills of characters who join in previous chapters. Also my Bard and Dancer's are now basically Celia/Lede assassins with all their awesome skills and a never-fail teleport movement skills. Not to mention, an updated script using the text from the PSP re-release without all that annoying stuttering during the skill sequences.

I just took another look and they've added tons of new tools to let you customize things even more. If you're like me and beat this game a few dozen times back on your PS1, then this really lets you revisit a classic game on your own terms.

To start off I'll jump right into one of my favorites in recent memory, The Last Remnant. While the story may have had some tongue in cheek cliche meandering, and characters that could be forgettable for the most part, the battle system was amazing and brutally difficult and unforgiving. Are there any Saga Frontier or Romancing Saga fans out there? Well this one was developed by the same team within Square that did those titles and you can see it in skill and stat progression. One of my biggest irritations with the game was how it discouraged grinding, while it may be dull to some I have always gotten a euphoric rush from killing some monsters and leveling up a good bit to even the odds on an upcoming boss. In this title the monsters grow with you so you can forget about that, but it always presents for a good challenge I suppose. I look forward to everyone's thoughts and happy Friday!

I don't know why, but I always have to play a mage whenever I'm given the option. Unfortunately, most games generally don't consider playing as a mage the main way to go. And as such, I never see any one game with a huge emphasis on creating a robust magic system.

I'm looking for a game that is either all about magic, or simply has a great system in place and you can choose to play a mage. I should've started by saying that I've already played the Fable games and Elder Scrolls and while some of it is pretty great, it doesn't really encapsulate what I had in mind.

When I say I'm looking for something with a complex system, I don't mean a complex skill tree of magical abilities and stats that can be improved just by leveling up.

1364411862.0	1b4lt3	I'm looking for a new RPG for my wife.  I could use some help.	AreYouReadyToReddit	25	4	25	"My wife and I are both pretty avid gamers.  She's getting a bit bored and is looking for a new RPG.

Now, before you start spouting out your favorite RPG, let me explain what my wife loves. (Dare I say, *craves*.)

**Party Interaction.**

Examples: 

Mass Effect 1, 2, &amp; 3

Dragon Age 1 &amp; 2.

Jade Empire

Kotor 1 &amp; 2

(Lots of Bioware, eh?)

My wife loved all these games, not because of their mechanics, or their premise---she just really enjoys talking to her party companions and having conversations.

The inter party development is really important to her. Do you know of any other semi-modern RPGs that do a good job with this?

I say semi-modern because we're both older, so she's pretty much played games of this type she liked from previous console and early PC years.

So can you think of any other RPGs with a big focus on party development and interaction? Ones that let you chat with your group, learn about them, get invested in their story, etc?

Thing's not to suggest (because we already have them or they're outside the realm of what we're looking for):

1. Ni No Kuni

2.  Skyrim (And other Elder Scrolls)

3. Fallout 3 or New Vegas

4. Baldur's Gates

Please upvote to help visibility.

**Kickstarters:** In general we've left these alone. The weak ones tend to get voted down and the neat ones get voted up. It's kind of a problem that some days there aren't many posts so even a low-rated kickstarter ends up on people's home page. Should there be a bar for these?

**Blog spam:** These have also been left alone for the most part. If the content is really trivial and pointless we have removed them, but the community seems to do alright sorting out the trash from the good stuff. Again though, these posts can end up on your front page on days where there aren't many submissions.

**Recommendation posts:** I feel like these have become a staple of our little subreddit and even encourage them.

games that'd suit a fan of Gothic 1 and 2?"	Kodix	25	6	46	"I can't seem to find a good place for RPG recommendations, be it on reddit or anywhere else. If you know of one, I'd love to use it in the future (I did check the sidebar, also).

Now, as to the meat of it. 

I spent countless hours playing the Gothic series. I'm confident I know just about everything there is to know about the first two games - so simply replaying them does not seem like a good option (unless there are some mods that augment the original ""campaign"" sufficiently? If so, I know of none.)

Gothic 3 was very lackluster for me - mostly because of the really crappy, diluted story and characters. 

I played through Risen - I thought the first half was somewhat decent, and it dropped in quality towards the end.
I checked out Risen 2, and I'm sad to say it didn't seem any good to me.

I'm mostly interested in the single character based gameplay with good story and an open, explorable world. I *adored* the story and the setting of Gothic, and the most enjoyable part of the games for me is the first act, where you spend most of the time exploring what can be explored.

&amp;nbsp;

RPGs I've played: Baldur's Gate saga, PS:T, FFVI,VII,VIII,IX, Chrono Trigger, Morrowind/Oblivion/Skyrim, Wizardry VIII, Fallout 1,2 &amp; 3,NV, Amalur (not very good), Witcher I &amp; II, Mass Effect I &amp; II, All of the various Divine Divinity games, Arcanum, Dragon Age, Fable: The lost Chapters, Neverwinter Nights 1 &amp; 2 + Expansions, Deus Ex, System Shock II, Jade Empire, Arx Fatalis, Icewind Dale I &amp; II, The Temple of Elemental Evil, Vampire The Masquerade: Redemption, Bloodlines. Probably more I forgot.

One of my favourite games is Divine Divinity. Don't get me wrong, it doesn't have a thing on Skyrim or the Dragon Age series (and Divinity II was, frankly, embarrassing) but this original game is something I've consistently gone back to since 2002.

I've played it and played it and played it. I just can't seem to get bored of it. So the other day I had this crazy idea what I would write a walkthrough for it. 

I guess my main question is - would anyone actually use it? I'm mostly
writing a walkthrough for my own entertainment. I'm 11k in (only in the catacombs, lol) and really enjoying myself so I'll probably complete it anyway. But do you think it would actually be useful to anyone, any more, seeing as the game is so old now?

**I hope this post is okay, it seems to abide by the rules. So excited for this community!**

Edit: I know there are walkthroughs out there for this game, I've used them myself. But none of them have seemed complete, or wholly accurate. They've missed things or failed to explain things that were really important that I had to find out on my own, or by trawling forums on the internet (which, fun as it sounds...).

But for some reason I can't force myself to enjoy the game.  I only got it because everyone said it's so great.  They rave about the storyline but so far I don't care about it.  Some guy wakes up in a mortuary, finds out he can't die, and is roaming through a city of weird folk.  I feel like I've put enough time into the game that there should be hints or clues as to where this plot is going but I just don't see them (I'm at the brothel in the nicer part of town by the way).

Am I missing something?  Did I accidentally skip an optional sidequest that was really cool?  When I'm feeling motivated I'll boot it up and play for an hour, but my enthusiasm just fades and then I don't touch it for a week or two.  

There has to be something I'm not seeing.  I'm all for different strokes for different folks, but so many people say Planescape is one of the best RPGs ever made that the problem is on my end.

Since the advent of HD gaming I've wanted to see a Final Fantasy 7 remake. Especially after the FF7 Tech Demo released by Squenix. If I had the resources and time I think I could make a reasonable remake which highlights the greatest and best features of all Final Fantasies.

The Story would obviously remain the same. with a few side things thrown in to make things a little more interesting. A longer timeline including multiple sections of each characters life, before during and after the events of the original FF7. so it would be essentially a collection of every FF7 game/movie/anime rolled into one.

Combat would be revamped for the HD generation. I know everyone laments over 13's Battle system. But I think given some greater strategic tweaks and being able to include the entire party like from 10 would make the battles varied, interesting and very cinematic.

Game Tie-ins. I think that some tie-ins for other FF spin-offs would be appropriate. Like At what point in Clouds life did he travel back to the world of Ivalice to fight alongside Ramza? Or at what point did Cloud and Co. make that magical universe jump to the Kingdom Hearts universe? and Yadda yadda yadda.

I think ALL weapons and armor should be cosmetic, or at the very least some costume changes. costume changes that make sense!  Like when the party moves to the northern Continent, I was vexed when cloud and Co. were climbing a mountain in short sleeves and skirts.

And this is all I have so far. If anyone would like to contribute with ideas they'd be greatly appreciated. Thanks guys!

EDIT: Thanks alot for the posts guys! They were very insightful. I think ALL of us Final Fantasy nerds would benefit from an upgraded remake for all of our favorite final fantasies. One thing that I would love to see would be an entire collection up to twelve to be released for one of the HD systems. I would gladly pay $150 for 1 through 12 plus spin offs in a single collection.

1369922318.0	1fc441	games similar to Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles?	stripedypaper	24	5	9	"so my all-time favorite RPG is ffcc for gamecube, but it's hard to describe what makes it interesting to me (it would be great if commenters have played/completed the game). I'll try to describe the basic elements of the game below, for those who haven't played it:

the game is split into multiple stages accessible from an overworld, each stage being replayable after completion but getting progressively more difficult after each replay. The stages are quite large, taking up to an hour or so if you explore them fully (longer for some confusing stages), and all have a different boss as the end. After beating the boss you will have a choice of several rewards ranging from equip recipes, to ingredients for recipes, to artifacts which permanently increase a stat (the only way to increase your stats). The quality of the rewards are also influenced by how many bonus points you collected during the stage, with random criteria selected such as number of monsters defeated, chests opened, money collected, etc (most of them encourage you to explore the level fully). I think this replay value for individual stages to get the best rewards is part of what makes the game addicting.

the game doesn't feature much character customization. You choose a ""race"" at the beginning of the game which determines your base stats and proficiency with casting magic (the melee class has shorter cast range and longer cast time than the mage class), and also the types of equipment you are allowed to wear. There is no level or skill progression. You have stats but they can only be increased by completing stages and collecting artifacts that you don't already have (thus there is a cap on health and your other stats).

on gameplay, it is your average hack and slash but you can also pick up ""magicite"" which enables you to cast spells. You can also fuse magicite to make more powerful or different spells (fire + fire = fira, fira + fire = firaga, fire + ice = gravity, etc), but magicite expires after you complete a stage.

also, there's little (if any) coherent storyline. something about memories and dead people.

suggestions appreciated, preferably for PC (native or using emulator), but DS/3DS or even android would work. also, I HAVE TRIED the DS crystal chronicles games but I didn't end up playing them through to the end."	t5_2su0w	True

What one factor of it really speaks to you, or makes the game what it is? I'm working on a long term project and if it happens to take off, I'll have you awesome bunch to thank. (and if possible, rewarded)

For me, it's story. A good RPG will feel like your playing through a well written book. This is part of the reason why I love retro RPGs in particular. The developers seemed to focus a little less on features and polished graphics, and more on evoking an emotional response from the player. They wanted you to become a part of the story, not tell it to you like many modern games.

I guess this is why I'm so partial to Earthbound. It's witty, emotional, adventurous story line captivated me when I was young, and still does. The lack of buffs or weapons or spells didn't matter to me, because I was too excited about saving my friends and discovering wonderful, new places. Every step revealed an interesting character or scenery that made me want to keep exploring. In fact, I wish the game would never end, which is sort of the idea behind this project of mine..

So, what is it about your favorite RPG that makes it so?"	t5_2su0w	True

I've played all later versions of it (aside from Saturn and iOS, I guess?), and they are all REALLY similar. The first game, however, feels completely different.

It suffers from the same issues old RPGs did. Specifically, not showing weapon stats (I remember hating this in SNES FFII (FFIV)), and not really telling you when your HP was low. I dislike only recovering in shrines/temples(?) and on the world map. I'm also having a lot of trouble earning money, but I'm still near the beginning so maybe that's it? I also dislike the fact there's no heads up for bosses, but I guess that also adds a challenge.

I knew [Luna doesn't come with you on the boat](/spoiler), but the rest of it, I've been in the dark. It's not really a bad thing, and it makes playing it more of a challenge in some ways. I've been cheating a little, and looking at guides to figure out which equip to buy - I don't have the patience for all that menu hopping.

So far, I'm up to the Trial before Vane. That stupid plant boss keeps kicking my ass, because whenever I get Alex to ""flee"" and avoid being cornered, he... eventually just runs into the boss (a problem usually in, literally, the corners of the screen).
If anyone has tips for this, it'd be really appreciated. Or just general stuff for the game in general.

I'd also love to hear what everyone thinks of the game, but please no spoilers on later plot points that have changed. Oh... I do know about [Ghaleon killing the Dragons](/spoiler) as well :(

Thereisnoself	25	8	49	"After seeing a recent thread in /r/JRPG  that asked if it was worth it to play anything before ff7, I've felt the need to actually try to play anything before 6. I've previously tried to play 4 and 5, and remember enjoying 4 quite a bit. But just never got around to finishing them.

So now I want to play FF 1 to 5, since I have some spare time. And since there are a kabillion different versions of each of these games now, was wondering what the best choice would be?

I am interested in getting new content. More streamlined battle system, graphics, story, etc.

I know that one of the versions of FF 4 was turned into 3D, and it looked like crap to me. Are there any other pros to playing this version that it might be good for me to overlook the 3D?

The systems available to me are NDS, GBA, PSX, SNES and PC.

1334096679.0	s3ajs	Which of these RPGs should I play?	MonsieurFixit	22	3	44	"Dear Redditors,

I've recently decided to play this bunch of PC RPGs that I missed. After Star Wars KOTOR and Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines, I want to play something a little older.

So here is my backlog:

* Baldur's Gate 1&amp;2
* Planescape Torment
* Fallout
* Deus Ex
* Arcanum

These all look like they are great games, and I enjoyed the games that I tried so far (even if I want to kill my almost useless companion in Fallout and I have troubles understanding Arcanum's controls... and the amount of choices in Deus Ex is mind-blowing). But I still can't decide which game I should play first and I will enjoy the most.

More than anything, I enjoyed resolving quests by dialogue and persuasion in Vampire. However, I liked a versatile character and being able to go on and slaughter all my ennemies if I was bored (but, eh, that's normal, I was a vampire).

Which of these RPGs allow this variety of gameplays^1 in the same playthrough? Which one do you prefer and why?

.^1 Some of you may be tempted to say ""Morrowind"" even though it's not on the list. That's a great suggestion, but I've already played it.

**TLDR**: Which game of the list should I play first?

**EDIT**: I finally asked the oldest RPGs' friend: ~~Gary Gygax~~ the Dice. And the Dice has decided that the next game would be Planescape: Torment. Who am I to contest the Dice?

I'm growing tired of modern button smashing rpgs, and I really need a good game. I love games of the Dnd-Bioware kind (BG, P:T, ID, TOEE, NWN) and the Might &amp; magic series. So, the game(s) I'm looking for shall include:

* A party to manage

* Complex rules: stats, abilities, talents, whatever. The more, the better

* Turn-based combat: hit pause, tell everybody what to do, hit pause again.

* Lots of stuff to read: long conversations, storable books/diaries with information and backstory about the game universe and such

* A decent storyline: I'm fine with having to save the world from some BBEG (I mean, isn't that what we've been doing for ages?), as long as the narrative is acceptable. 

* Possibly, isometric view (but I'm fine with first person either)

1370437987.0	1fpvwc	RPG Maker Games: Exit Fate, and I Miss the Sunrise	orpe	22	3	11	"Half recommendation, half seeking recommendations, I have recently finished one of these games, and started the other, and am always looking for more great (and more importantly, finished) RPG Maker games to play.

Exit Fate is the one I have just started, which is a big love letter to the Suikoden franchise. The battle system seems fairly standard (albeit magic is a little odd, since MP goes up each turn, magic is shared between all characters and has limited uses based on how many of the 'item' you buy, but never runs out), but they clearly spent a lot of time and effort doing portraits for all the characters, and the rather large battle sprites. The only thing thats irking me so far is its clear they took art assets right from the PS1 Suikoden series (easily noticeable in the towns). You can find it here: http://site.scfworks.com/?page_id=10

I Miss the Sunrise is a whole 'nother ballgame. Its a futuristic RPG where all the battles are based between spaceships. The combat system makes or breaks the game for you, and is rather intricate. Each ship has 3 different HPs (Hull, System, Pilot), all at 1000, and if any are reduced to 0 the ship is destroyed. At the same time, every time you use a weapon, you use a bit of one of those HPs, depending on the weapon. You spend a lot of time crafting parts together to make weapons to cover a variety of damage types, and not rely too much on one HP type. The story is good, there's a lot of time spent on the backstory and making the world make logical sense.

I have a few questions that I would like answered.

First off, I really want to make a game that has a cartoony, welcoming style, but has a serious, and sometimes dark, story and deep character development. Would this hurt the overall feel of the game, or would it be a welcome change of pace? How do you feel about it?

In games such as Skyrim and Fallout you start off with a blank slate. This is great for roleplaying but sometimes at the expense of main character development. Would you rather play a pre-written character or start with a blank slate?

At what point in time is it best to start the main characters journey? How much back story should be known and how much up for interpretation?

Party based or lone wolf? Open world, or more linear? 

Sometimes Open world games make you feel like the only important and likable character (Oblivion and Morrowind are two possible examples). Would a heavy reliance on supporting cast be important or is it all about the player?

What is your ideal class system? How much should it effect gameplay? Should it be based on stats or the player's skill?

How much gore is too much?

Please feel free to add anything else. In the future I'll make a post when I have some art assets and stories and such based on my fantasy setting. (I do have work on it if you are interested).

I vaguely remember reading about the system and how it would curve it for those that played too much of one class on one day, etc, but never really gave it a try myself, so I don't understand all the commotion of how it ""flopped"". I know FFXI was great, so it's hard to understand how bad it could be.

Also, how do I get a copy? I can't seem to find it on sale and I wanted to get into the Alpha test.

1352028856.0	12lx0w	Record of Lodoss War - Dreamcast	Porkpants81	18	3	9	This game is easily one of my top 5 favorite games EVER.  It came out right at the end of the Dreamcast's lifecycle so it didn't get any hype or love.   If you haven't played it I strongly suggest you do, it's the only thing I still use my Dreamcast for.	t5_2su0w	True
1348376689.0	10bx9d	Thoughts and questions after coming from Planescape: Torment and recently finishing Baldurs Gate 1.	Asian_Persuasion	22	5	19	"First off, I want to say that BG1 was a good game. However, going to BG1 immediately after PS:T was a pretty big letdown. To be honest, I was bored throughout the game (except for Durlag's Tower, but only because of how challenging it was to do it before doing Nashkel). The whole world seemed extremely plain and unvaried. The story was too typically fantasy-like, I wasn't given enough choices and my decisions rarely had any meaning. The characters were all pretty flat and their voice acting got semi-annoying after listening to them for the umpteenth time. Given all of that, I still beat the game since it was the first game to come out of the BG series and PS:T. I figured that the first game will have its hiccups and would be improved in upcoming games.

Then, I started BG2, and to put the following thoughts in perspective, I have only just left the torture chambers and am now in the Promenade. One of the big things that I missed from PS:T, that was partially added to BG2, was the description of the environments in text form. This is going to sound cheesy, but no matter how detailed and artistic the visuals are in a game, nothing will beat how it looks in my head. Also, actually giving some characters depth is a big step up. Yet, even with these improvements, BG2 is still nothing special when comparing to PS:T.

So, I guess my question is, will BG2 more closesly resemble PS:T later in the game or will it just be a shadow of PS:T? If not, what games are similar (similar in terms of the aforementioned gripes about the BG games) to PS:T? I have tried googling and have come up with Fallout, Arcanum and Neverwinter Nights: Mask of the Betrayer. Am I correct in that those games have a similar style to PS:T? Was I just wrongly recommended these games previously when I wanted to know what games were similar to PS:T?

**TL;DR: Disappointed in BG games after playing PS:T. Are there similar games to Planescape?**"	t5_2su0w	True

1343160432.0	x39vo	I would love some suggestions on picking up a new RPG. It's been a long time since I've played one that I actually cared about. Recommend me something!	Randy_Raccoon	23	4	73	"I haven't played a decent RPG in a long time. Since I bought my 360 years ago, I've spent a lot of time playing Fallout, Elder Scrolls, and FPS's. I really miss RPG's, and I miss the PS1. I'd love to get back into an RPG, and need help figuring out what to play.

Here are some details that might be useful:

- My favorite RPG's of all time are definitely Chrono Cross, Legend of the Dragoon, and FF7, X, and 12.

- I'm a massive fan of Chrono Cross, and I loved how grinding and random battles weren't a necessary part of the game. More time could be spent on the story, talking/chatting/exploring in cities, and running around the map. The pacing of the game also felt great because you wouldn't have to waste a bunch of time leveling up and trying to equal out your party members. Are there any games like this besides CC?

- Also, I really enjoy turn based RPG's, and I know that Lost Odyssey is a good example of a recent one, but I actually bought it a few years ago, got halfway and couldn't finish it. Cooke and Mack were two the most annoying video game characters I had ever experienced, and I had a really hard time caring about the rest of the characters. Everything felt really forced. I was really disappointed.

- I'm not opposed to battle mechanics that are similar to FF12. It's not my first choice, but I enjoyed it. 

- The story is probably the most important thing for me. I will put up with somewhat frustrating game mechanics if the story is engaging enough.

- I'm definitely a huge fan of PS1 era games as well, so if you think you know a game I might be interested in that's from that generation then don't be shy. I always love an opportunity to break out the Playstation.

- I have a 360, so if you can think of any recent games that might fit the bill, then go ahead!

Thanks in advance to anyone that offers up suggestions and recommendations. 

EDIT: Forgot to mention I also have a PS2, in case it wasn't clear earlier.

EDIT 2: Been getting a lot of awesome suggestions. I've subscribed to /r/rpg_gamers as a result of how helpful you guys are. Feel free to keep the suggestions and recommendations coming! I still haven't made a decision yet (although I have narrowed down the list somewhat). Ideally, I would love to play all of them in the future, so I've been making a list of the notable recommendations."	t5_2su0w	True

I just started up a game of Baldur's Gate.  It's great and all, but I feel like I'd prefer to play it on PSP instead.

I suppose I'm not too attached to the D&amp;D system, but I thoroughly enjoyed KotOR one and two as well(boy, if they ported those over to a portable I'd snap that up immediately).  I guess I'm looking for something in a similar vein- Classes, stat allocations, feats/skills/etc., that sort of stuff.  Sci-Fi works just as well as fantasy.  Ah, yeah.
