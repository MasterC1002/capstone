1365270502.0	1bt08n	Minimalist Tape Dispenser.	Methylene_Chloride	90	9	39	"This sub-reddit is a bit quiet, so I thought I could post up some recent work of mine to design a tape dispenser.


This is a 2nd year University project to design, manufacture and sell 20 of a product. Most people focussed on keeping it chap and simple, I wanted to design it to be cheap and simple. So here it is.


After initial brainstorming and rough sketching of ideas, I settled on the tape dispenser, and I wanted it to be a functional, simple to use product. I came to the conclusion that a single piece of polypropylene bent around the role of tape with a serrated edge would work, so I went ahead and made a batch of prototypes testing lots of different things. 


http://i.imgur.com/9a8f8qv.jpg


It failed, every single one failed completely, in every imaginable way. I at this point could either change my product, or make it work. Back to brainstorming and looking at other dispensers. Looking at how they worked, why they worked and what made them worked I figured out why mine didn't. I done this before redesigning, to not waste time and effort on a flawed idea. 


A solid material was needed, so I changed to acrylic, again lots of different designs I started to change what I was designing, It stopped being consumer and cheap and it became more aesthetic, even a bit designer. I still focused on function, like all of my design work but kept an eye on the aesthetic, playing with shape and personality.

Finally, one of them worked. So far I counted roughly 40 prototypes, and one worked. But I wanted to know why only one of them worked, the where cut from the same sheet, using the same machine at the same time with the same (roughly) serrations. But only one worked. 


My theory was that it was the angle of the serration, so for my next batch they had the same serration, copy and pasted. I then changed a few to be a bit wider, taller, thinner, less of an angle etc. 


None worked. This project became an obsession, grades didn’t matter, other work was put aside and I needed to know why It didn’t work. I used a microscope, endless testing and testing. Two rolls of tape later I realised why. So a new set of prototypes where on their way for the next day...


http://i.imgur.com/o0FAhgZ.jpg


they all worked, I could relax. Now I could look back at what I had designed. I stepped back and looked at the latest batch and I had three options:


Option 1: Make a consumer tape dispenser (original plan)
Option 2: Make it smaller into a key ring
Option 3: Focus on aesthetic, make it ""designer""


I chose option 3 after much deliberation, talking to peers and tutors about it, because of development cost and the more expensive material, making it cheap and selling it cheap wasn't a viable option. I needed to add value to the product.


http://i.imgur.com/KPjoeB6.jpg

Now I had two options for my aesthetic. The face, which I named ""Tape Mate"", or the leaf, which I named ""The Last Leaf"". I ended up taking it to vote with everyone I knew and met, and just carried an example of each in my blazer pocket. 


The outcome was the leaf, so I was onto Final development of the product, and my final 4 prototypes. 


http://i.imgur.com/yOaXWRZ.jpg


And then onto my final product, a minimalist tape dispenser. I believe it is the smallest tape dispenser for a full size roll. And it is universal, as the roll sits underneath it can take any diameter and up to 30mm wide tape. It is also I believe the only tape dispenser to be made from a single material.



Here is the final product, and a .gif of me using it.

I feel like our field is highly unknown, and not well defined. 

I've been told I make factories, machinery, that I am an engineer, that I'm an artist, or that they were completely oblivious. I'm in my senior year and my family still asks what my degree is called.

I feel like the fall back thing to do is say ""Product Design"" but that even confuses people so I move on to saying ""everything you buy in a store was designed by someone like me...""



Also I noticed that there are many titles that describe our field while searching job listings:

* Industrial Design

* Product Design

* Consumer Design

* Commercial Design


Edit: I get the feeling from your responses that it becomes easier when you have a focused area/industry to work within. Saying ""I design phones"" or ""Automotive Design"" is really less confusing, and if you work for a company chances are you'd just say something like ""I design product at Sony/Nike/GE/hasbro"" and people will understand what you do.

I think the hardest thing to describe would be if you worked for a consultancy and have no area of expertise since you work on a broad spectrum of things every day. I guess I would lead with the companies you design for most."	t5_2qiv5	True

We wanted to solve the problem of headphones getting tangled and broken in your pockets and getting lost all together. With phones getting thinner an thinner, we thought we could make a winding mechanism that's thin enough to integrate into a phone case.

After 29 3D printed prototypes, we have come to a design that is very functional, sleek, and compact. We've been making our prototypes based on the iPhone 5, and have it thinned down enough that the iPhone 5 with case is thinner than the original iPhone 3G with no case.

We're calling our product, ""TurtleCell"" since its peripherals retract into a neat, protective shell. Please comment with any critiques you may have and other features you might like to see added. If we're successful with this launch, we're hoping to include a microphone and extended battery in future iterations.

Here are some renderings of our model that I've made for presentation purposes:

Also, we've started to get the ball rolling on the business side of getting investors and moving toward a large scale manufacturing run. Here's our website and a link to our kickstarter pages, which include videos of the case in action and photos of the existing prototypes.

I didn't think being a girl mattered until...	drunk_vegetarian	25	7	60	"I realized that my professor has no respect for me. While talking with classmates we were discussing one of our professors and I began to vent. About how he constantly talks over me, or stops listening when I ask for perspective on a project to suddenly talk to another student, or he walks out of the room while answering one of my questions. A classmate agreed that the professor gives me a harder time than most others, and another chirped in that the prof treats the program like a boy's club. I'm glad to graduate this semester, but I feel like my grad project might suffer from lack of insight and help since this professor is the grad final leader. I've been working with an insightful classmate instead of bothering with the prof. It's so discouraging for going to a class he teaches.

I'm often the only girl in my classes. There's a total of three others total in the major, plus one woman who already had a career in the military and a family. I separate the last classmate because she's much more bull-headed and less willing to take crap from anybody, and her age seems to buy respect and a sense of being the professor's peer. The professors made one of the other girls cry. (I wasn't a witness, but the girl always struck me as strong and the news was such a shock.)

In other situations, I was moving a large project when my boss exclaimed ""Wow! You're pretty strong for a chick!"" and when I went to a conference an established designer encouraged me to look into breast pump design EVERY TIME WE CROSSED PATHS. It took me ages until my classmates stopped teasing me, which was troublesome every time I tried to borrow tools. Someone once told an acquaintance that I'm ""a good designer for a girl."" It's wearing me down.

I'm hoping the (sexism?) weird treatment would be contained in school, but it seems to exist in the professional world too. How much of this is in my head? (It was incredibly validating to hear my classmates noticed the professor's behavior too.)

What is the trend with the job market? Is I.D. becoming more popular/needed?

Are the salaries good?

After months looking for placements whilst still at University, I utilised the contacts I had and ended up working for a friends dad in the marketing and advertising industry (Manchester). When that placement finished, I continued my search for a permanent position within the product/ graphic design industry with just one solid piece of work experience. I began working as a freelance creative designer, building my portfolio in both industries and watching my client contact list (very) steadily grow. Not only did I apply to recruitment agencies in my local area but I also applied to several in Bristol, London, Manchester and Oxford.


Eventually (after many stressed complaints here and r/jobs, r/UKJobs and r/graphic design) I had a bite, a small but thriving furniture business required a trainee product designer (Autodesk Inventor).
After two tense interviews I got the phone call offering me the position. When I asked what they liked about me, they mentioned my enthusiasm and how my portfolio showed evident strengths and benefits that could aid their business.


*I wanted to share this with you to prove that there is hope for all graduates of all skill sets (Stay productive!). If you would like any recruitment agency links that I personally had good experiences with, please don't hesitate to ask.*

So my question for you, how can I become better at drawing/sketching? Obviously practice is a key thing, but I'm looking for a more detailed answer. Are there certain techniques that I should look into or practice that are hidden from people who don't know anything about drawing? Are there any specific practice exercises that can help me become better at drawing? Anything helps really, I just would like to avoid the, ""practice, practice, practice"" answer.

My drawing skills are non-existent, but I am extremely visual and have no problem rotating, flipping, unfolding, and building images in my mind. Getting it on paper is the hard part. Especially when it comes to perspective and proportions. In terms of rendering software, I don't know any but I am extremely adept with the computer and learn fast.

- I have my BFA in Photography, and while pursuing that I discovered ID.
- I completed the coursework for my MFA in ID, but I'm still working on my thesis.  A personal thesis with no given problem to solve was a challenge for me, and I didn't nail a starting concept until late in the last school year.
- Thesis took a back seat to a job search after school.  After 8 months of full-time job searching, my brother got me a tangentially related job as an engineer.

Now, I'm miserable at this job.  I design brackets and adapters, make technical CAD drawings and I'm discovering that my employer firmly believes that I went to school to be an engineer.  0% Creativity.  I've been there for 7 months now, and needless to say I'm still applying to other jobs 20-30 hours a week, looking for a way out.

I fear that my lack of degree and my stagnating/declining skills are much of what is holding me back.  My portfolio needs work that I can't give it right now. (portfolio: tomnasca.com)

I've heard some good things about industrial design, and I think I understand what it is you do... atleast what the finished product is, but I'm super curious about what it's like to be an industrial designer.

So... to the questions!

1. What is one specific thing you enjoy doing on an average workday?

2. What is one specific thing you dislike doing on an average workday?

3. What is your favorite thing about being an industrial designer?

4. What is your least favorite thing about being an industrial designer?

5. What is one thing you wish you knew about industrial design before you became an industrial designer?

Alternatively:  What's an average day like for you?

I've been on the software side of robotics for a while, and am just starting to play around with physical design.

So firstly for some background I am a product design student from New Zealand and i'm working on my final year major project. Two classmates and I were approached by a lecturer to design a conceptual urban micro-vehicle. The goal of this is to design something that the university can show off to prospective ID students while being a functional concept vehicle at our end of year show.

Part of our brief was that we were given the framework and running gear from a Piaggio mp3 400 trike. http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3wjxdsx6x1ruzgrfo2_500.jpg (Obviously not the most ideal forms to design around and ultimately we would have preferred to start from the ground up) 

We are at the stage of having finished all of our research and now starting to develop and test concepts in full size. I wanted to know if you may have any tips/tricks or secret methods to make these ideas. We don't have the facilities to make a large clay model.  Currently we plan to CAD + CNC or cut/sculpt foam/polystyrene to create and test these.

1337040086.0	tnb8x	Trying to figure out if industrial design is right for me	becleverer	10	1	15	"Hello industrial designers!  I only recently discovered your field in my search for a new career path, and I'm trying to learn about it and whether it's something I should seriously consider. 

I'm 25, and graduated with a BA in studio art in 2008.  Since then, I've just worked where I could find a job- as a caricature artist in a theme park, and then as a bank teller.  I've been thinking a lot lately about going back to school, this time with a little more direction and with the aim of something that will help me get a job.  The art degree was paid for by scholarships, and I did not have any better idea what to do with myself at the time, so I don't regret it, but it hasn't been helpful where careers are concerned. 

Industrial design appeals to me because it requires both creativity and pragmatism, seems useful and interesting, and seems to focus on problem-solving, which was always my favorite part of art-making to begin with.  

However, I've been reading here and there about ID, and haven't gotten the impression that it's in high demand at the moment. It seems to me that, like a lot of technical art-related jobs, it would be something that gets outsourced a lot. But, I haven't found much solid information about the field yet. 

So, I'm curious - just how bad is the job market for industrial designers?  At 25, if I'm going back to school, I want to make sure it's for something that will lead to a good job.  I already have one degree that I'm not using.  

What skills does a industrial designer really need to use?  I have a strong art background, which seems like an advantage - but just how useful will that be?

What programs exist, and how does one get in them?  What kinds of classes do you generally take?

I really appreciate any information or advice you might have to offer.  I am just looking into different options for myself, and didn't really know ID existed as a field before a month or two ago.  I had googled ""engineering design"" because I figured there MUST be something that bridged the two.  So here I am. "	t5_2qiv5	True

I studied Engineering and received a Bachelors in Engineering in the fields of Computer Science about 2 years ago. After passing out I landed a pretty sweet job working as a Researcher for an organisation. I had a healthy amount of experience in Front end development up until then and when I stepped into my job that part was recognised and I was handed a few books to read. I discovered Interaction design and have been working on it ever since. I still currently work as an Interface designer. A colleague of mine back then suggested ""Design of Everyday things"" to me and I went ahead and got myself a copy and started reading. Although I hadn't realised it then, I was falling slowly in love with product design. Two years have passed by and now that I'm looking at applying to Grad school, I stand rather confused among all the fields that I can jump into. I want to work somewhere in the circle covering Interaction Design, Cognitive Science and Industrial Design. Past few months I've run across a lot of things that involve Industrial Design and it seems to me that Industrial Design would be the better choice for me because my background in Computer Science. Having this background will help me move into Interaction design if I want to in the future. Correct me if I'm wrong here.


I was speaking to someone I work with the other day and he mentioned to me that I don't have a good background for Industrial Design and would not be accepted into grad school. Although I don't have anything much Industrial Design related under my resume I have been working in Interface design and have lately been working as a designer at a new place where I work on Visualisations, Games, Digital and Print design. I'm pretty good sketching and I'm willing to brush up on it. I have some past work up on [my website](http://www.amarchadgar.com) It is not up to date. Please check it out and let me know if do have the qualifications for Industrial Design. 


Also, although I've been going through most of the discussions here regularly, what are the job prospects for an Industrial Designer with a background in Computer Science Engineering?

**I am working on a project for school, but i'm currently debating on which topic to choose.**

First Topic- During my freshman year, the head of my school's department (which also happens to be our adviser/professor), gave us a supply list of what we would need for the year. Everything was pretty much self-explanatory- kneaded erases, white eraser, sketch pad, and etc. But then he listed 'markers', which obviously doesn't explain anything about brands/colors/shades/quantity. When we asked him, he said ""Buy which ever color you like and also two others- one that is lighter and darker."" But as the year went on, i realized that i needed to buy more markers than what he suggested. At the end of the year, i ended up with about 20 markers. Markers that i don't really use any more. 

So, What do you guys think about this?

**TL;DR- Topic 1** A color-customizing marker that customizes specific colors (maybe through color picking an image, physical object, through photoshop/Ai,) by using CMYK. [Similar to this.](http://www.gearfuse.com/color-picker-lets-you-grab-the-colors-of-nature/)

Second Topic- From what your just read, you can already get sense of how bad this professor was at introducing kids to ID. In fact he was horrible. So, for this second topic i was thinking of creating a kit, something that may look like [a carrying case of a hand drill](http://www.p-wholesale.com/upimg/17/700a2/impact-drill-kit-kf-6005-183.jpg). But instead of having tools it would have..

1372612373.0	1hdf2c	Anyone have experience with sketching/rendering on an ultrabook?	slowferrari	9	2	17	"I know this comes up from time to time, but new stuff is coming out all the time, so I figured I'd ask.

My MBP is showing its age, I'd like to replace it with something significantly more portable since I very rarely use it for any modeling (I have a dedicated workstation for that at home).

What I'd really like is a 13-14"" ultrabook that I could hook my 12wx up to if I needed to work away from home. I have had good luck with Asus products so I'm looking at a ux31vd because it pretty much checks all the requisite boxes, 13.3"", dedicated GPU, and upgradable ram and HDD (although a big ssd would be ideal).

The thing is, I've seen some stuff on YouTube to indicate that SBP and CS6 will both run fine on integrated graphics. So I'm wondering if there's another one I should be considering.

Two notes: I'm not looking at a macbook air because I know it can't handle an airbrush tool for some reason. Also, I'm not considering a Zenbook Prime because they only ship with 4gb ram and it's soldered to the motherboard.

TL;DR: I want a smaller laptop but I want it to be able to run Photoshop. What are my options?"	t5_2qiv5	True

IDwannabe	8	3	6	I'm currently between schools and taking some general education courses at a community college in order to keep my student status. I was academically dismissed from my previous university after spending 3.5 years there studying mechanical engineering. I have had two internships with a national lab in an engineering department where all I did was CAD for future hypothetical situations. There I used both SolidWorks and ProEngineer. I also spent 8 months interning with a company that manufactures utility truck vehicles where I used SolidWorks designing for manufacturability in the company's design department. I didn't realize until my last semester at the university that it was Design that I was so good at, not engineering. I did well on all class projects, especially those that involved any sort of design and did well in my non-engineering courses. I would really love to transfer to a school that offers Industrial Design as a major (as mine does not, and none in my state do) but I'm not sure if I would be accepted (and pretty scared of my dreams being shot down if not).

Otherwise I guess I could just deal with it and become far more adept with the Adobe suite which I do need to brush up on as well as other analog skills.

So I am looking for some feedback/guidance from you all. Did any of you follow a similar path (starting out as engineers) and how did it affect your career? What is your work environment like?

I sort of fell in love with ID after reading DOET in human factors class, but of course by then it was WAY too late the change majors. I have done quite a bit of woodworking in my own time and I think right now Furniture Design is high on my list on interests. 

Does anyone have any working knowledge of this program? How difficult is it to get into? My GPA is not the best by any means, but hopefully schools take into account that it is an engineering degree from a top ranked school (Virginia Tech). Do they even look at you if you're below a 3.0?

I noticed they had some entry level classes that you can take without being in the actual program. Are these worthwhile? I don't have any sort of portfolio, though I do do a fair amount of hobby woodworking and could possibly put something together from that.

I really like Pratt because it is highly ranked and I love NYC and am hoping to live there when I graduate whether I end up trying to get into the program or not. Would it be better for me to wait a year or two, try to work in a studio or with an engineering firm and then look into applying? If I take the Intro classes, I would guess that I'd have to do this anyway.

Finally, am I even in the right boat? I'm enjoying woodworking and I enjoy product design (I can spend hours on the internet looking at product and furniture design websites).

What i want to know is if Industrial Design is more about being a ""inventor"" or if its more about re designing existing products better and more efficient? If ID is all about inventing a new product, i don't feel like i have the creativeness to do so career-wise. But if it's all about the aesthetics and feel of current products and solving problems, i feel like i could easily come up with many designs for every day objects. I've tried to do as much research as i could at the moment, but i'm not getting a real clear answer on whether there is an actual need for ""product designers"" here in California. I understand a lot of design for US companies happen outside of the country, so that kind of scares me a little about trying to go into this industry.

I should also mention I was also studying a concurrent degree in Business (cross-crediting for the electives of each degree). After a few years of work/travel/soul searching I've returned to university to finish my economics degree.

So anyway to my question. The university I'm attending offers a Bachelor of design course (ID major) and also a Diploma of design. The credits I've so far achieved are more than enough for me to apply to receive a diploma in Industrial Design. **My question is, will having *just* a diploma hinder me in getting an entry level position in the industry?**

Designers (here) seem to work in a cocoon, separating themselves from the real world. We have a client who needs something and our designers would rather design something that will never work. Spools need to be a size for a reason, plastic needs a certain wall thickness to be strong, you need draft to make something.  All these are unnecessary as far as our designers are concerned.

I understand it's nice exploring concepts, but there is also a need to keep it real.  Nothing pisses a client off like showing something either they shoot down as impractical or we have to go back in a month and explain why it would not work.

Seeing students coming up with that is impossible to make is unfair to them - they don't know any better. Design education has a lot to answer for.

What will be next? The article says that the big, desktop computers will make a comeback.

Whether you think that ""bigger is better"" as stated in the article, or you have a completely new idea, what should computers look like?

I am looking for industrial design program specifically in New York State because then I would be able to get additional financial aid. I wondering the list of school that offers industrial design. 
At this moment I am considering pratt, rit, and syracuse. (I'm leading towards RIT and Syracuse because no matter how much I love NYC, I want to get out of here)

I already have an Illustration A.A.S from Fashion Institute of Technology. I was also contemplating on the packaging design degree over there but I do not want to be limited to packaging.

Since I am still in NYC, I would thinking taking a few classes over the summer. any recommendation? I was thinking of 3d design and design and presentation at fit. (taking product design 1 non credit class at pratt during the spring)

I have a pretty good idea what I need for portfolio but suggestion would be greatly appreciated also reading material!

Would it be good thing to show packaging design projects/drafting/type/drawing/sculpture for ID?

However, I'm having trouble brainstorming up solutions that wouldn't just be a combination of existing light, oxygen, or massage therapy. Basically, I need a break-though or I'll be scrapping this topic.

If anyone has come across any interesting articles about new discoveries related to depression, or, better yet, any suggestions for another thesis topic/problem, it would be much appreciated!

1364583013.0	1b99uz	Do Industrial Designers focus solely on form?	snarlbuckle	7	4	11	"Ever since my first set of Legos and K'nex, I've been having fun building stuff.  That trend has never stopped.  Since then, I've taken a variety of engineering courses (CAD, R+D, physics, robotics, etc.) and my projects have consistently blown the competition out of the water.  I dropped out of school due to some personal drama, but I never stopped building cool stuff.

I have the opportunity to go back to college soon (I'm 27), and I've been looking very seriously at Industrial Design.  I have one nagging issue though.  95% of the ID projects I see online look completely useless in real life.  They look to me like modern art intended to solve problems that don't exist in the first place.  I understand that most of these projects are probably displays of creativity rather than actual commercial products.  I have to wonder, is real design work so impractical?  

I'm used to making things that outperform the competition in ergonomics and user friendliness as well as function.  I love doing this and the more I do it, the more I find that human interaction with a product is what really makes or breaks it.  Most of my projects are for personal use, but I hope to get some of them into full scale production eventually.  

To recap: I love what I've read about Industrial Design as a profession, but when I look at people's projects I have my doubts.  Do Industrial Designers focus solely on form, or do they balance that with function and performance in a real work environment?

I'm leaning toward Long Beach, mostly because it's in my state and it ranks fairly well for ID. I've heard good things from many people about the school, it's only a couple hours from my home city, their program sounds awesome (especially the upper ""half""), and i have a friend in the ID program there.

on the other hand, Western Washington sounds interesting. I would like to go on adventure and live somewhere other then a beach town. Washington is a fantastic state from what i hear. but i don't know very much about the actual ID program it self.

But I am concerned that seeing as the Graphic Design field seems to be suffering in the job market (from what I heard thanks to do-it-yourself template programs) that 3D printing at home may marginalize the need for designers.

I've done a little bit of research, but would appreciate different perspectives from people with experience.

Some questions I have:

* Is a Master's degree in ID plausible for someone coming from a fine art background? Is it worth it? Is it necessary?

* What is school like?

* What is work like? Working conditions, what do you actually do, pay, job stability, career outlook, etc.

Just as a reference, I like working with my hands, and I like building things. I'm not too interested in graphic design, but I like drawing/painting.

1357272396.0	15xjky	Industrial Design Woes	snowfro	2	2	1	"Hi /r/industrialdesign.

I randomly ran across you today... Maybe you can offer some advice?

I'm in the process of patenting a little device that a friend and I are working on. We're super excited about it and have high expectations for it but we've hit a speed bump and we're having a hard time getting over it.

Problem is I've spent a decent amount of money with an industrial designer here in town and have gotten nowhere with him. He's super nice and had what I thought was a genius plan but that didn't work out so now I feel like he's scrambling for ideas and not getting anywhere. 

I've approached a couple of other industrial designers separately and they all assure me they can give me a solution but want $$$ first to make it happen. Well that didn't really work out the first time so I'm not too eager to pay someone else to experiment. I've also now waited four months while this guy drags his feet and am still right where I started.

So what expectations am I allowed to have from the industrial designer? If he cannot produce should I request some of my money back or is that out of line? I'd like to move on but I don't want to waste my time or anyone else's time anymore.

I don't mind paying for the solution either! I'm confident that I'm not looking for anything that is impossible to make.

Maybe I can set up a contest? 

Or approach a school or organization?

I'm open to ideas. I have found that there are not many industrial designers in town. Google searches turn up a bunch of people with furniture in their portfolios but that's it. Lots of people know about metal and wood but I need softer material expertise like silicone and/or fabrics.

Oh and basically what I'm looking for is an enclosure for bracelet. There are electronics involved. 

Thanks for reading.

1357194796.0	15vjd6	Advice for an upcoming Industrial Designer graduating with an engineering degree?	QuestionAxer	1	1	4	"Going to graduate in May with a degree in Industrial &amp; Systems Engineering from a very well-reputed university; specialized in Human Factors &amp; User-Centered Design. Realized a year ago that Industrial Design is exactly what I want to do with my life. I'm 21. Male.

I absolutely love sketching. Give me a day to myself to do whatever the hell I want: First thing I'll do is grab a pencil and a sketchbook. I love drawing cars, products, literally anything. I've taken a couple mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering classes (Product Design, Medical Device Design) and got a lot of experience sketching mechanical functions of products, mechanisms, blow-apart drawings, cross-sections, plane and perspective product views, etc. I find this stuff a LOT of fun. I wouldn't say my sketches will blow your mind, but they're very good at conveying the necessary information and are definitely very clean and well-drawn. A couple of the clients I worked with for the Product Design class actually said that I have very impressive sketching skills and that I should consider ID for graduate studies.

I'm currently working on a portfolio website where I showcase all the stuff I've done so far. Aside from ID, I've got a lot of web design experience, along with graphic design, print design, and photography. I'm putting all of this into my portfolio.

To cut to the chase, I'm not sure where to start for a career in ID. Literally no-one is going to hire an entry-level Industrial Designer. Everywhere I've looked, they want 2-5 yrs of experience. The only skill that I don't actually have that the employers are looking for are hardware prototyping skills. Nothing with form studies, foam models, scale models, functional hardware prototypes, proof-of-concept models, or anything like that at all. Most experience I've got with this is a couple gargoyle mugs I made out of clay which I glazed and painted later.

So, the bottom line is: Where do I look for experience in hardware prototyping? What can I do to actually get hired as an Industrial Designer? Should I get a Masters degree in Industrial Design, or should I just sketch more so that I have more to show employers?

**TL;DR: Wannabe Industrial Designer graduating with engineering degree. Have decent experience, good sketcher. Zero hardware prototyping skills/experience. How do I get a start in the field? Where do I get the prototyping and modeling experience? How and where can I get hired? Should I consider a masters degree? If so, where?**

Sorry for the boatload of questions. Any suggestions/tips/advice appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Drawing is my weakness, I am a second year student and my lecturer has said to me I could easily walk out with a first class degree if my drawing was better. I can do everything else. 

But I have never been able to draw, cubes in perspective is about my limit. I have tried warm up techniques, read books and watched videos. So I think for me it is more of a phycological thing, I can imagein my ideas, and draw them in CAD, just not on paper, I cant spin paper in 3D...

worst of all I need to produce about 40 of them in the next day or 2 if I am to finish on time. So I thought I would ask for any tips, has anyone been in my situation?

I just got a new assignment for school and I'm pretty stuck and without ideas. 

My assignment involves using a cardboard box to create something that could be useful in a docters without borders field hospital. We're supposed to use the same box that is now used for shipping medicine and emergency supplies. 

The first things I had in mind was to transform the box into some sort of cabinet which then could be used to store the medicine in an organized way. But that is the only thing i can really think of. And it's pretty obvious.

Pretty much anything useful in a field hospital/disaster context would be allowed to be designed with that box.

Does anyone have good ideas or things that could inspire me?

1359747647.0	17pm5s	Please help me design this !	semartin0816	2	4	1	I know reddit can help me do this.  I need guidance or event outright assistance in designing a particular plastic shape, two small pieces that are identical, yet latch together rotationally.  This is a small thing, about the size of a salad bowl.   I'll pay for the service or I will follow whatever guidance can provide.  Or, if you are interested, we can partner up on the product and marketing.  Thanks !	t5_2qiv5	True
