1360083391.0	17xusx	Stoner Rock A-Z: today's letter A	leech	62	4	71	"Ok, let's start our own Stoner Rock A-Z, like others does ([r/Metal](http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/16duzr/metal_az_a_stolen_idea_starting_with_a/), [r/Punk](http://www.reddit.com/r/punk/comments/14qcjy/the_alphabet_game_today_letter_a)).

The idea is to create a thread every day, where each comment is for a band which name starts with current day letter.  

Format should be like, band name in **bold** and song name linking to a video of the song:  
**Kyuss** - [Whitewater](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcY3UF6_IaM)

And all child comments are related to this band, may include albums, information or discussion.

Just one post per band. Don't repost bands.  
""The"" is not considered part of the name. Example: ""The Desert Sessions"" starts with ""D"".

Let's start it!

I've heard some great new music and learned some interesting stuff from here, so thanks to all of you.

There is just one problem I have - it seems to be getting more and more saturated with the metal/doom side of stoner rock rather than the heavy, psychedelic grooves I first fell in love with. I had the idea of making /r/desertrock last week to try and share some finds and hopefully discover some new stuff from some like minded people. Well as it turned out someone had beat me to it, but the last post there was several months ago and it wasn't very active at all and I'd really love to get it properly up and running.

So if you too are more geared towards the psychedelic, tripped out soundscapes of bands like Causa Sui, Yawning Man, Colour Haze and The Machine please subscribe and share this love of great music with others. I am going to make a post at r/desertrock now as a bit of an intro and post a few of my favourite, hopefully lesser known tunes. 

By the way I don't mean to say I don't love the really heavy side of stoner rock as well (to an extent), two of my favourite bands are Kyuss and Black Sabbath, and I certainly don't mean to insult anyone's tastes or complain about this great subreddit, I'd just like a more specific kind of stoner rock that's further away from heavy metal. 

Peace and love brothers and sisters

**EDIT: Glad to see a lot of you are subscribing, hopefully we can get a really good community going at /r/desertrock. I've just made a post as a bit of an intro with some tunes to check out (please check comments on it, I couldn't self post) and a few people have posted some heavy grooves as well. See you all there!**"	t5_2quxq	True

The idea is to create a thread every day, where each comment is for a band which name starts with current day letter.  

Format should be like, band name in **bold** and song name linking to a video of the song:  
**Kyuss** - [Whitewater](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcY3UF6_IaM)

And all child comments are related to this band, may include albums, information or discussion.

Just one post per band. Don't repost bands.  
""The"" is not considered part of the name. Example: ""The Desert Sessions"" starts with ""D"".

Let's start it!

Ever since seeing these guys play Warp Riders stuff live at a Kyuss concert I went to a few months ago I instantly loved it and had to get the album. Usually it takes me a few listens to get into something but I very quickly enjoyed the riffing, energy, and theme that went along with these songs. I decided to put together this post to keep a bunch of stuff in 1 place for you guys. Enjoy.

Wikipedia description:

&gt; Warp Riders is the third studio album by American heavy metal band The Sword, released on August 24, 2010. Recorded between February and April 2010 at Wire Recording in Austin, Texas, the album was produced by Matt Bayles, marking the first time the band had hired an external producer. A concept album centred on the story of a protagonist named Ereth from a planet called Acheron, Warp Riders marks a conscious change in style for the band, incorporating more elements of hard rock than on previous albums. It was the last album to feature original drummer Trivett Wingo, who left the band in October 2010.

Songs &amp; Lyrics compiled:


**[Acheron/Unearthing the Orb](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYmgjk22qXA)**
[Instrumental]

CD booklet info:
(Upon the forsaken world of Acheron,
the Archer is exiled from his tribe.
In his solitary wanderings, he makes a
singular discovery within the ancient ruin...)

**[Tres Brujas](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ychYEqWpL88)**

A strange voice within his mind
from the glowing orb in his hand

Spoke of the properties of certain herbs
growing wild all across this land

Three witches you shall meet
along the road to your fate

The first at twilight, the second at night,
and the third at the coming of day

Inhaling deeply of the sacred smoke

Slipping in between the worlds

He beheld a living column of light
and it sang to him without a word

Three witches you shall meet
upon the path to your fate

The first will love you,
the second will deceive you,
and the third will show you the way

Draw back your arrow and let it fly

May your aim be straight and true

Remember all that you have been told
and there might be some hope for you

Three witches you shall meet
along the road to your fate

The first is twilight, the second is night,
and the third is the coming of day

**[Arrows in the Dark](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wuvsnV0-zI)**

Bound for the black country
as the light recedes behind

Upon the white odonatar

Witch's vision as their guide

Be wary and keep watch tonight

Make sure your weapon's at hand

Here in the land where shines no light
death can strike you where you stand

There in the ruins
borne of darkness

Approaching the altar
as the arrows begin to fly

Beware the tribes of night

They take no one alive

So stay wary and keep watch tonight

Make sure your weapon's at hand

Here in the land where shines no light
death can strike you where you stand

**[The Chronomancer I: Hubris](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7yCchUbbKM)**

Feigned exultations in the court of the autarch

Proclaiming heresies sublime

Sought by his enemies with lethal fascination

Self-styled traveler in time

He has learned forbidden wisdom
not meant to be known

His skin became a prison
where suffers his soul

Within the chamber buried deep below
was wrought the means of his escape

Across the aether
the other one must go
to sleep until that distant day

Across the aether one must go
to meet her fate

The other buried deep below
as he awaits

Arcane science of temporal exploration
known to no one of his kind

Immortality through artificial transformation

To rule a world that soon will die

**[Lawless Lands](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pxicylHN9o)**

Yonder rides the Archer
lost in lawless lands

Onward rides the Archer
alone in lawless lands

Some strange power beckons
from beneath the ancient sands

No woman will have him

No man calls him friend

No woman will have him

No man calls him friend

Exiled and outlawed
by his only kin

Through twilit skies he rides

Searching the darkened side
of the world

Into the night

Never knowing he has been lead astray

Through lawless lands he flies

Across the burning face of the world

Under the suns

His life begins to slip away

...a shining angel descends

Down from the sky

Her coming was foretold

**[Astraea's Dream](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdfYVfHK3HQ)**

[Instrumental]

Booklet info:
(Amid the lifeless crags of distant Leeth,
Astraea slumbers throught lost aeons, while
great forces converge upon Acheron. Her
awakening fast approaches...)

**[The Warp Riders](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2SCIoq0VX4)**

You will not find us among
those who dream of escaping

Across the aether we've come

All is ours for the taking

You don't age when you live out of time

A thousand years in the blink of an eye

Secrets of the blackest void
known only to the ancients

Freedom from the planetoids
and the gravity that chains us

To make a fold in space and slip
between the curves

Sacrifice of the sisterhood to do for those
they serve

To cross a universe in hyper-spatial flight

We ride the warp of space into the
womb of night

Ouranos' daughter, Hermes' bride

Mistress of the Mysteries

Upon the Warp she rides

Navigatrix of the star-seas

She makes a fold in space, we slip
between the curves

Sacrifice of the sisterhood to do for those
they serve

To cross the Universe in hyper-spatial flight

We ride the warp of space into the
womb of night

You don't age when you live out of time

A thousand years in the blink of an eye

**[Night City](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E39p-0l11Kc)**

There is a place where the losers win

A port of call for desperate man

It is known by many names

We come and go but it remains

Nobody cares, nobody cries

If you're scared or if you die

That's the way it goes

You should know...

You're in the place they call the Night-side

In the shadows where the killers and the
pirates hide

Stick around if you think you
can survive
in the city on the Night-side

Running scared through endless night

Too afraid to put up a fight

They shackle her wrists

It's too late to resist

Scanned for weapons and transmitters

Sold at auction to the highest bidder

That's the way it goes

Now you know...

You can find us on the Night-Side

In the shadows where the killers and the
pirates hide

Come around if you think you
can survive
in the place they call the Night-side.

**[The Chronomancer II: Nemesis](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HTiEV6uBcU)**

Far across the gulf of time
he watches all unfold

The cursed day draws ever nearer
as he has foretold

The bearer of the orb awaits the
sacred key

Into the world anew once more
what was will be

Racing through the netherworld outide of
time and space

He has found a hidden path to pass
forbidden gates

Body left to rot as the great
tidal lock sets in

The cord is cut, the way is shut,
the orb goes dim

[**\(The Night the Sky Cried\) Tears of Fire**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPE05DjwbYs)

It was a relic of another time
plundered from an anceint tomb
wrought by forgotten arts
inscribed with cryptic runes

They called us fierce marauders

Warp riders and guns for hire
before the sky cried tears of fire

Looking out across the void
we beheld a fearsome sight

Two armadas arrayed before us
preparing to unleash their might

The Lady kept her promise

We heard the sound of a cosmic choir
the night the sky cried tears of fire

This is the hour of the Phoenix
when all must be reborn in flame
and though they did not know it
nothing could remain the same

The Captain has his vengeance
as we drift through a sea of pyres

The stars will always remember
when the sky cried tears of fire"	t5_2quxq	True

I knew that it was a concept album, and was vaguely familiar with the story, but didn't know much about it. The story is *crazy!* These guys must have been smoking a *lot* of pot when they wrote it.

So what is your understanding of the story? I've got a list of characters mentioned in the lyrics here:

* Ereth, the Archer
* The Outlaw (mentioned in Lawless Lands, is this Ereth?)
* The Chronomancer
* The Slave
* The Autarch
* The malevolent Warp Riders
* ""The Other,"" a mysterious female figure mentioned in Chronomancer I. Perhaps this is Astaea? *""Across the aether the other one must go to sleep until that distant day / Across the aether one must go to meet her fate.""* Maybe this is the same *""Ouranos' daughter, Hermes' bride, Mistress of the Mysteries ... Navigatrix of the star-seas,""* mentioned in The Warp Riders...



I'll type up my interpretation here in a little while...

The idea is to create a thread every day, where each comment is for a band which name starts with current day letter.  

Format should be like, band name in **bold** and song name linking to a video of the song:  
**Kyuss** - [Whitewater](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcY3UF6_IaM)

And all child comments are related to this band, may include albums, information or discussion.

Just one post per band. Don't repost bands.  
""The"" is not considered part of the name. Example: ""The Desert Sessions"" starts with ""D"".

Let's start it!

The idea is to create a thread every day, where each comment is for a band which name starts with current day letter.  

Format should be like, band name in **bold** and song name linking to a video of the song:  
**Kyuss** - [Whitewater](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcY3UF6_IaM)

And all child comments are related to this band, may include albums, information or discussion.

**Just one post per band. Don't repost bands.** Post all the band's other songs as child comments to the original comment for that band.

""The"" is not considered part of the name. Example: ""The Desert Sessions"" starts with ""D"".

Let's start it!

1360649072.0	18d3ib	Stoner Rock A-Z: today's letter H	bruce656	25	1	40	"Ok, let's start our own Stoner Rock A-Z, like others does ([r/Metal](http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/16duzr/metal_az_a_stolen_idea_starting_with_a/), [r/Punk](http://www.reddit.com/r/punk/comments/14qcjy/the_alphabet_game_today_letter_a)).

The idea is to create a thread every day, where each comment is for a band which name starts with current day letter.  

Format should be like, band name in **bold** and song name linking to a video of the song:  
**Kyuss** - [Whitewater](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcY3UF6_IaM)

And all child comments are related to this band, may include albums, information or discussion.

**Just one post per band. Don't repost bands.** Post all the band's other songs as child comments to the original comment for that band.

""The"" is not considered part of the name. Example: ""The Desert Sessions"" starts with ""D"".

Let's start it!

I currently host a specialty show every Tuesday night from 9-11 pm (Central Time) called The Rusty Cage. While the previous DJ of this show played lots of deathcore and such, I was given enough freedom to change it. Now, I play a really kickass combination of stoner rock, sludge, doom, and post-metal. I'm sure many of you would enjoy it. My show bio and the radio station website can be found here: http://www.klsuradio.fm/rusty-cage/

This Tuesday, July 10, I will be playing Sleep's Dopesmoker in its entirety. Does anyone know if it's ever been played on the radio before?

1360428886.0	18754f	Stoner Rock A-Z: today's letter E	bruce656	23	2	23	"Ok, let's start our own Stoner Rock A-Z, like others does ([r/Metal](http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/16duzr/metal_az_a_stolen_idea_starting_with_a/), [r/Punk](http://www.reddit.com/r/punk/comments/14qcjy/the_alphabet_game_today_letter_a)).

The idea is to create a thread every day, where each comment is for a band which name starts with current day letter.  

Format should be like, band name in **bold** and song name linking to a video of the song:  
**Kyuss** - [Whitewater](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcY3UF6_IaM)

And all child comments are related to this band, may include albums, information or discussion.

**Just one post per band. Don't repost bands.** Post all the band's other songs as child comments to the original comment for that band.

""The"" is not considered part of the name. Example: ""The Desert Sessions"" starts with ""D"".

Let's start it!

Dear Friends,

it took a long time and was a hard way but finally we made it: the
recording, mixing and mastering of the new Colour Haze album is finished and
in the end all turned out quite good I'd say, despite all limitations and
difficulties. In the next days we will cut the master and finish last
details of the artwork, so next week the Double-CD is off to print and the
Vinyl to cut. i.e. In latest 3 weeks the DCD and in abprox 4-6 weeks the DLP
will be available. We hope to bring to you a lot of pleasure and joy with
this album, we tried to give our very best... ; )
Please do not send any mails with preorders! I'll send a regular newsletter
with more details when the CD is available.
I intend to release the Vinyl at first in a limited version only - 1000
copies of colored and another 1000 copies of black vinyl in a relief-printed
3-panel fold-out-cover. This issue should be high enough that nobody needs
to be afraid to miss his copy... later there will be an unlimited version
for a nicer price of course. But also here: more in the next newsletter.
Please excuse I was often slow in sending parcels and answering mails the
last weeks - I devoted everything to the album...
Best Wishes

Anyways, in no particular order:

- Planet of Zeus - Macho Libre
- The Vendettas - Burn
- Red Fang - Murder The Mountain
- Sahara Surfers - Sonar Pilot
- The Black Keys - El Camino
