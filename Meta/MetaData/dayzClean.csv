Few simple reasons:

1. **We are really busy making the game**, and the pace is such that by the time we'd finish a decent video blog it was so out of date that it would give the wrong impression.

2. **There is enough ""PR"" already** coming from pre-committed engagements like E3, gamescom, pax, etc... without adding to any hype that had already been generated.

3. **We want to make a great game**, we don't want to rush. I think there are some who are thinking ""*I really want the alpha to be released!*"" who should actually be saying ""*I really want the alpha* **to be GOOD**""

I do realize that the majority of those waiting, and also the majority of reddit, want the alpha to be good and not simply released. My purpose here is to try and succinctly explain why we should all want it to good rather than just released.


**What we don't need:**

* To rush the release because we are ""losing hype"" or because people are losing interest. That's fine, it won't damage the experience on release unless less than about 1000 people buy the alpha. the mod was still very fun with just 1000 players.

* To fill the world will devblogs, updates, and trade shows. I feel like I am now doing the bare minimum. I'm going to the shows largely because I believe that interfacing directly with people in the industry (such as E3) and the players (gamescom, pax, rezzed, eurogamer) is something that I wish game designers did more of. I just don't have time to do any more interfacing than this bare minimum.

So hopefully that gives people some perspective on what my thoughts are on where we are at."	t5_2ty3s	True

1360879799.0	18jjkp	The female bait.	harteliuz	1315	243	148	"So, i was just messing around with my girlfriend to try something out, with her being female, and the average gamer being a dude, i wanted to see if i could actually lure well-equiped players into death by using her voice in a friendly, seductive manner.

So, we started off in cherno where we found somewhat basic gear, then headed up the the barn north of it where i got my hands on a m1014 shotgun.

Perfect, i thought, this will be enough to kill anyone at close range if we can somehow trick them into close quarters.

So, onward towards NWA, we come up north of stary and im scouting the hangars for other players, it seems empty at first, but after a few minutes a SUV shows up, moving onward towards the barracks, passing the ATC. 

We sneak up in the east treeline, and eventually we hear the ongoing engine from, presumably, the same SUV.

I move closer, and as i thought, i see 3 players, one being bandit, two gillies, parked next to the barracks, and seemingly lootcycling it (putting stuff into a tent just outside of it).

I quickly decide to let her crouch towards them, yelling distinctly, yet calmly, ""Hey guys, im friendly, please dont shoot me"". I could tell by the reaction that this was the first time they encountered this, and so they began a friendly conversation and like most of would do, they hit on her, and she flirts back.

At this point i move towards the tinshack (next to chopperspawn) and i tell her to tell them, that she found a motorcycle here and that she really loves them, its however, missing a wheel - maybe one of them could help her out?

As they move closer i've already assumed position next to the door, ready to fire, as she moves in two of the guys follow, while the bandit is still waiting outside as driver in the SUV. She quickly turns around, closing the door, while i take them both out with 3-4 m10 bodyshots.

I hear the SUV engine turn off, i quickly tell her to grab the m14 from one of the gillies, the door opens, i get shot to the head almost instantly by a FN-Fal, and after some shootout, she manages to get him down.

We pick up all their gear, load it into the SUV, and she picks me up at the coast.

Oh, how i love her.

So if you saw one of rockets comments recently he said he would be interested in doing an AMA on here if one of the mods contacted Matt Lightfoot on the forums. I've gone ahead and started the paperwork and we / I have come up with two ideas of how we can do this.

- Rocket does it ""live"" and replies to questions as they are asked... IE - how it is done in r/iama

- We submit questions here and upvote the best questions you think should be asked. We take the best 10-20 upvoted questions from this thread and get rocket to post a response here with his answers, or one of the mods gets the answers from him.

So lets get some potential questions going and feedback into what kind of Iama you guys are looking for and I will try and get that rolling. However it is the weekend and he is a busy guy so this might take a while.

1367733914.0	1dpy9y	WARNING: New Breaking Point updater phones your BE GUID home. One step away from stealing your CD key.	jonthegiant	1177	223	509	"In the newest rework of Breaking Point's launcher, there exists some ""anti-cheat"" code to detect for default installations of the popular hacker tool ""Cheat Engine"". If the launcher finds even the remnants of a Cheat Engine install, it'll phone home.

After that, it grabs the current Windows username. 

Now, these functions themselves aren't too scary, however the code doesn't end there:

This is where the real damage can be done, the launcher computes your BE GUID offline. In order to do this it **reads** your ***ArmA2 CD Key* value in your computer's registry**.



It takes all three of these variables(Cheat Engine Flag, Windows Username, BE GUID) and sends them back to update.dayzbreakingpoint.com/data.php

That final step is what really bothers me, and should bother the DayZ community as well.  

I confronted Deathlyrage about this issue on the official Breaking Point teamspeak server, and this was his response:

&lt;00:18:56&gt; ""Mandis"": seriously man, checking for the default installations of cheat engine?

&lt;00:19:18&gt; ""Mandis"": reading the registry key too?


&lt;00:19:41&gt; ""Mandis"": That's a little scary


&lt;00:19:53&gt; ""Deathlyrage (Dev Of The Month)"": cool story bro


&lt;00:19:59&gt; ""Mandis"": excuse me?


&lt;00:20:45&gt; ""Deathlyrage (Dev Of The Month)"": if you have a problem


&lt;00:20:48&gt; ""Deathlyrage (Dev Of The Month)"": with my mod


&lt;00:20:53&gt; ""Deathlyrage (Dev Of The Month)"": GTFO


**I was immediately banned after this.**

This is your lead developer guys, talk about professionalism.


 
Edit: **To those wondering how I came across this information, it's not hard to disassemble a .NET application into source code. If enough people ask for it, I can post the offending code to pastebin.**

Okay, I did this and haven't had the graphics artifacting since, no matter what my in-game graphics settings are. I'm running a single GTX 560 TI and Windows 7.

First thing is you want to make sure your GPU drivers are up to date. Go to [nVidia's drivers site](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) and find your card and update that shit. No matter how recently you did it, just do it.

Second, go to your Start menu, then Control Panel, and then nVidia Control Panel. This is going to let you configure your card **IF** you have the latest drivers installed. I'm not even joking about the drivers thing, update that shit to whatever the site says you should have.

Once you have NVIDIA Control Panel open, on the left side of the window you should see ""3D Settings."" Go ahead and click the ""+"" sign to expand that down if it isn't already. After that category is expanded, click ""Manage 3D settings.""

Now, on the main part of the window, you should be looking at a box with two tabs. One of the tabs will be labeled ""Program Settings."" Click that one.

Click the drop-down menu and you should be presented with this big fuckin' list of programs that nVidia recognizes. If ArmA 2: Operation Arrowhead is in there, click it. If not, you'll have to add that shit.

To add ArmA 2: Operation Arrowhead, click ""Add"" (you fuckin' genius, you) and then drill down to where your ArmA2OA.exe is. I have the Steam version, so mine is in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\arma 2 operation arrowhead. Select ""ArmA2OA.exe"" and then click ""Open."" BAM. You just added ArmA2OA to the list of programs that nVidia recognizes. Grats, you're a fucking technological wizard.

Scroll down until you see ""Threaded optimization"" and TURN THAT SHIT OFF. It should be set to ""Auto"" by default, but we're not even going to fuck around with that. Turn it off.

There. You're done, it's fixed. Exit NVIDIA Control Panel, if it asks if you want to save changes, you best save that shit.

Fire up DayZ and go ahead and look at some dead soldiers to your heart's desire (you sick fuck).

**EDIT:** Hey, ATI card users/wiz kids/geniuses, if ATI cards have a similar setting, go ahead and look into turning it off and see if it fixes the problem. If it does, **spread the word about that shit**.

**EDIT2:** Fuckin' S128K DELIVERS with a *possible* ATI fix. I don't have an ATI card so I can't test it, somebody get on that shit. [Here's his comment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/yhksh/successful_graphics_glitch_fix_for_nvidia_gpu/c5vn3y8)

**EDIT3:** Because a bunch of you were bitchin', I changed the instructions to include how to do this for ArmA2 only and not have this settings change affect your other games. On a side note, now that we know this work-around, maybe it'll help Rocket get this actually perma-fixed. I'm pretty sure he's got that shit covered, though."	t5_2ty3s	True

This idea scrapped because bandits feel left out.

**Screen2(c) Good Guy Death:**
http://i.imgur.com/qhIoJ.jpg?1

(Updated due to Bandit Rage of feeling punished for not getting a reward. Just to proof a point, the so called ~~achievement~~ Smiley Flower is just a pretty picture and has no in game value whatsoever. It is not the achievement you understood from current games.. Now that the achievement is a Smiley Flower, would bandits still insist on having it? Very interesting discussion nonetheless =) cheers!)

- This introduces a ~~reward system~~ Smiley Flower for being a nice guy and to discourage any form of killing.

- To gain one **Survivor Rescued** you must apply **Blood Transfuse+ Bandage + Morphine/Painkiller** to a player

- To gain one **Survivor Revived** you must apply **Epi-Pen +Blood Transfuse + Bandage + Morphine/Painkiller** to a player

- These stats should not be saved, and are meant to be screenshot captured only. This will discourage stats peddling as a screenshot would not be rewarding enough for a stats peddlers to waste time on.

**Screen2(c) Bandit Death:**

- If you **die as a Bandit**, the second page will be **blanked out** and ~~**no achievements**~~ **no Smiley Flower**


I believe this would drastically change the whole gameplay of DayZ. Even though it is a sandbox game where players are allowed to do as they wish, being the good guy would meant having a proper closure when you die and the game time you invested in are rewarded appropriately. With this in mind, hopefully banditry activities would be drastically reduced and Zombies could become the priority threat again. With more aggressive zeds, players will have to be more cooperative to fight against them..


.


**TLDR:**

- **Bandits** ~~gets loot as a reward which may **prolong their gameplay.**~~ doesn't get Smiley Flower.

- **Nice guys** get ~~achievements~~ Smiley Flower (basically just an acknowledgment and has no in-game value whatsoever other than a pretty picture.)

- You can be a bandit and yet still be the good guy as long as you **heal more people than you kill!!**

***UPDATE 1: 19 minutes after posting, they had received so many messages they have agreed to get things back online. Thanks people! I will post more details when we have them available. In the meantime, it appears we'll be all go soon.***

***UPDATE 2: Good detail of the background of why it happened at this post:*** 
http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/157qzu/dayz_hive_is_down_i_need_your_help/c7k0p3u

The central HIVE server for the mod was originally provided donated by one of the early hosting companies, as a thank you to the project, most likely because (like many server companies) a reasonably large amount of money is being made out of DayZ servers by hosting companies.

Recently this hosting company changed hands, and as a reseller, it would appear the technical contacts were not updated with their parent hosting company. The invoices were not paid, and then seven hours ago the hosting account was cancelled. This account holds the HIVE central database needed for authentication of the mod.

So far, Ander, Matt, and myself have tried desperately to try and get some resolution.  I have offered the company to pay the account myself, I have threatened to name and shame, I have done everything I could to get the server back online but all they will do is email the technical contact they have (the email no longer exists) and they will not take my money to bring it back online.

What I asked for was for the hosting company to turn the server back on while all this drama is sorted out, I was told (and I quote) that ""the server cannot be turned on, for security reasons"".  I asked what was meant by this, and was told ""the listed owner might not have been paying for some important reason, and we would be breaching his security by reactivating it while this was sorted out"". As only the non-existent email is listed as a technical contact, they would not accept my money to reactivate it.

We have two options, we're running with both.

1. Setup a new server (we're doing this now).
2. Get the old server turned back on and sort out the issue (we're still trying to do this too).

I'm hopeful that we will get the old server up and running. It would help to see a show of force from the community, indicating (politely) that we would love to see the server turned on until the issue can be sorted. The company is:

***EDITED: contact details removed, as the company has changed their mind***

I spoke to Chad at support, who specifically said, if anyone has any complaints all they need to do is email that support address and send them to him.

It would be awesome if people could politely get in touch with Phonenix NAP and ask them, perhaps in the spirit of Christmas, to put the server back on while we sort out the drama. I'd really appreciate that, because I am sure if enough people help out they'll agree to put the server online until we can try and locate the previous hosting owner who was the technical contact.

I'll post more information as I can, details still emerging."	t5_2ty3s	True

Edit: Update Rant Incoming

The level of douchebaggery in this game is unparallelled. I have played for a total of 59 hours thus far and I have encountered ONE friendly survivor. His name was Amon and I gave him a gun, a hatchet, and some food for helping me with a blood bag in my time of need. Other than that it has been nothing but fuckheads ever since.

I could understand being killed by other players in order for them to upgrade their arsenal with my gear, except I have yet to be killed by someone who has gear/items that are of lesser quality than mine to warrant an upgrade on their part. It is always someone with some AR50 (or whatever its called) picking people off for the fuck of it and not taking anything off their corpse afterwards. 

I have tried to be a nice player since i began playing this game, I really have. Every time I encountered another survivor I would announce that I was friendly and even help them out of they were in a pickle and be on my way. Each time it was a survivor with next to nothing, as I would be dammed if I would help out someone with an assault rifle knowing that theres a good chance hes just going to blow my brains out anyway.

Each time I was backstabbed, trolled, and just fucked over it took a little away from my ""kindness"" in the way I play. I think the straw the broke the camels back was when I was in Cherno getting gear to head north with and after shooting a zombie in a building I heard someone on voice chat go ""FRIENDLY! DONT SHOOT!"" and after announcing that I was indeed friendly as well, he popped around the corner and shot me in the face without a second thought. 

This didn't anger me, rather it just gave me a ""fuck it"" mentality. There is no community anymore, and if these asshats what to be 1337 and dickheads then they can be dickheads without my gear. Thats right, today was the first time I ever logged on someone. Someone I wasn't even actively engaged with in combat either. Am I ashamed? A tad, but at the time I was just so amazed that someone could be such a dick that I didn't care anymore.

I was running from a town with a horde of zombies behind me. I had planned to lose them in the forest when I saw another survivor pop out of the woods i was heading towards. Not wanting to take any chances, I immediately switched directions. I didn't stop and shoot at the guy, I simply went a different way with the horde chasing me. After a few hundred yards I heard bullets wizzing past my head. This guy had a sniper rifle and was shooting me with it as I was being chased by 10ish or so zombies. At the time I had nothing but an enfield and a makarov on me along with some survival tools (Map, compass, knife, matches, axe). Clearly this guy was geared and was gaining nothing by killing me. I wasn't a threat to him whatsoever yet he felt the need to attempt to kill me. 

After one of his shots connected, I went into shock and began bleeding. I fell the the floor in prone thinking ""Is this shitlord serious? I had no desire to engage in combat with this individual even though I had the enfield, a one shot kill against survivors and zombies alike, and yet here he is shooting at me from a few hundred yards away for shits and giggles.""

At that point I had sincerely hoped that he did not have matches, an axe, a map, a compass, and the other tools I had because he damn sure wasn't going to get them off of me. I ESC'd out and aborted out of there, server hopped, bandaged myself up and went on my way. I even ran into a newly spawned player and gave him some food and an axe to get him started and continued my search for a vehicle (I have yet to find one in 59 hours of playing). 

So there you have it, I caved. I ALT-F4'd on guy and in some ways im laughing about it now knowing the shitbag doesnt have my stuff, even though im sure it wouldn't have been much use to him anyway. I realize this goes against my initial post but I do still believe that there should be restrictions when it comes to up and leaving the game. I should not have been able to get away from that guy no matter how much a dick he was. 

Anyway, I suppose I should find a group over in LFG to run with since obviously running alone is just asking to get dick sauced. Sorry for the wall of text, just needed to rant about it.

TL;DR - I caved and ALT-F4'd on a guy. I was butthurt, dont care, fuck him, I still have my stuff, I already have all your upvotes, etc etc"	t5_2ty3s	True

1345457954.0	yimen	An explanation from a -100k humanity bandit.		896	237	435	"I see a lot of people posting on here talking about how merciless and trigger-happy bandits are. I am one of those bandits and I thought I would clear up some misconceptions.

First, most of us are in Elektro playing this team deathmatch pvp game because of the poor state the rest of the game is in. When tents are a safe way to store loot, vehicles are legit and bases aren't a complete waste of time, then I know myself and my whole group will all be moving up north. For now though, we've sunk hundreds of hours building bases and repairing vehicles that are just reset or deleted upon server restarts. We play the Elektro-pvp minigame because it's fun, but also because it doesn't frustrate to the level that the rest of the game does at the moment. It's not like counterstrike or modern warfare in that we don't get free guns, we start at a huge disadvantage in the city and must work our way up the pvp ladder. It's a very fun pvp game that's completely unique to any other FPS and I think it's overlooked by a lot of people.

As for the ""unarmed survivor, why would you shoot me?"" posts, I won't shoot you as long as I see you leaving the city. When you step towards the guy I just dropped with an AS50 I really don't have a choice. There is always a tinge of guilt when I shoot someone not in a Bandit outfit, but generally it's because those people are in a very bad spot. If you're going to try to loot bodies on sniper hill, you're probably going to get shot at. There is literally 1 city in the game that 90% of PvP bandits use and it's Elektro. If you're looking to survive, use one of the many, many other cities.

I wish the people who want to just survive and build bases the best of luck, but please, stay out of Elektro if you don't want to get shot. The pvp minigame is all that some of us have left after we've played hundreds of hours in buggy servers. When the standalone is released, you better believe I will be RPing it up as a base-building, vehicle repairing, zombie slaying son-of-a-bitch, but for now, I'll be countersniping Sniper Hill."	t5_2ty3s	True

1342459711.0	wniav	This game is ridiculous.		775	149	144	"I've only been playing for 3 days or so and that's the conclusion I have come to.

I first heard about this from someone on a Diablo 3 stream, downloaded it all and figured I would jump right in.

After doing the Arma 2 boot camp to get the controls down, I jumped into a server and started heading towards the first town.  Immediately I heard gunshots.  I thought to myself, ""Oh shit!  Someone is being chased by zombies, I'll head over there and help them out!"" (Help them with no weapons, looking back probably help them by dying myself)

I ran towards the direction of the gunshots and learned my first lesson in Day Z as I got shot in the face and bled out on the ground.

I realized my mistake and loaded a new game.  I looted a canteen and took off deep into the woods (heading north) where I wandered for about 30-45 minutes aimlessly until I realized I had drank my canteen, it only had one drink in it, and I was now starving and dehydrated.  I was pretty much about to give into the fact that I was fucking dead until I spotted three tents together on a hillside.  I ran up to them for what was about to be loot Christmas. (Sorry whoever donated to my survival cause)

One FAL, NVG, GPS, tent, food/drink later, I headed towards the town that begins with an L (southwest of an air strip) in search of more food.  Being a total noob, I went in and long story short got murdered by like 30 zombies. I dropped all of my equipment right before I died and told some guys I had met from this sub in vent the coord location.  Unfortunately they all got wiped in a firefight minutes before, so maybe some lucky guy was able to find my eq.

I finally linked up with these guys and had a fucking hilarious time in Cherno lighting up the whole city with flares and looting like mad men, until I had to call it a night.  All I can say though, is that this game is ridiculous, and I can't wait to leave work and be terrified to log in again.

1343154681.0	x33e0	So I declared war on them.	vertigo1083	804	182	208	"Last night, I logged onto DE 541.  The ping was decent, I was fresh spawned, so the daytime was good.  There was ~20 people or so on the server.  I spawned near Otmel, and to my shock, there is a rubber raft right on the beach.  I take it to Elektro.  (What can I say, Im a glutton for punishment).

The next thing I know, a helicopter crash lands 30 feet from me, just outside of elektro, and this screaming man tumbled from it.

He was holding an AS50.  I hadnt really taken a good look up until that point.  

It was goddamn pandemonium.  

Elektro was literally burning.  The north firehouse was a leveled piece of rubble.  The sky contained no less than 3 choppers, firing miniguns.  The sound of gunfire was everywhere.

I barely had registered all of this when shots pinged off the side of the fallen chopper.  A little voice inside my head said: *You know what to do*.

So I declared war on them.  

My little friend with the AS50 was also sporting satchel charges (hacked, i know).  I took them, the gun, determined the source of the guy firing at me, and shot him directly in the face from 600m.  (Wow, I fucking love this gun!).  Then, I incurred the wrath of the chopper and its mini-gun.  Seems my late friend relayed my position to his friends in the sky.  

I scrambled into the schoolhouse, fairly sure that I lost the chopper.  To my surprise, the courtyard is filled with *3 more choppers* (unmanned).  What the hell?  Alrighty, then.  

I crawled out to them, and tried to figure out how to disable them without causing too much ruckus and giving myself away.

Oh, yes.  I have bombs.  

So I place the charges onto 2/3 choppers and was about to google how to detonate them when my friends in the nearest flying chopper discovered my position.  Back into the schoolhouse I run.  I made it all the way onto the roof when it dawned on me.  Could I...?

I lined up the shot to the helicopter, lying on the roof, aiming for the pilots windscreen.  The first shot pinged off the rotors, I'm pretty sure.  He definitely heard it because he swung the chopper *facing right into my line of sight*.  The 2nd shot did not miss, I'm guessing, as ""Havok had died"" and the chopper spun out of control and crashed.  The other player inside dies.   Inbound comes the next chopper.

I could not seem to line up a good shot on the pilot.  Either i was losing my nerve, or he was all over the place.  I checked my clips; 22 bullets left.  Lets rock.

I let loose both clips into the chopper.  Around 15 bullets or so, it starts smoking, and then promptly burst into flames.  In the span of the last 5 minutes, I had taken down 2 choppers and a sniper, total, 5 bodies.  Jesus.  I could only wish that it was more legit.  The hacking seems to take away from the accomplishment a lot.  Oh well.  I dislike hackers on public servers, fuck em.

Feeling pleased with myself, I was just about to log off this crazy ass server when I saw someone dart out from 3 buildings over.  Then another person, and another.  4 people making a dash for the choppers.  Only 3 bullets left.  Fuck.

[Oh, wait](http://i.imgur.com/MGwEN.jpg).  Satchels! (lol!) I furiously google how to set them off.  I tab back in just to see the first one lift off, with the 2nd one turning blades.  If I had a pair of sunglasses handy in real life, I would have put them on before pressing the button.

I'm not sure what was more satisfying.  Watching *all 3* helicopters explode, killing all 4 people, or the admin message that came up afterward, and what followed.

""Fuck you, Rambo""

I dunno what the hell type of plane it was, but it came from the east, and proceeded to bomb the absolute shit out of Elektro.  Well, that at least explains the leveled buildings.  I considered Alt+F4ing out, just to be spiteful and keep the AS50; but fuck it.  I didnt earn it anyway.  

It was much more satisfying that they had to level a city to finally kill me.

I don't always get blown to all hell and booted off a server, but when I do;

It's because I ruined a hacker's day.

#TLDR:

Go fuck yourself, read it.

They ignore the users, and press on to meet their profits. We also see games that are stale. Re-hashes of old semi-successful games. Or even blatant rip offs of other more successful games. 

Rocket has essentially become the poor mans dream in the gaming world. So many people aspire to be game designers and create their own games only to fall short. Rocket has not only created a game that he wanted, but ended up creating one of the most successful mods in recent memory. Not only because of how unique the game is, but because of his communication and the connection he has with the people who play his game.

I think it's time for big developers to take notice and take notes. Rocket and the team he's working with are proving that you don't only have success with your game, but with how you treat your customers. It's so essential to business, yet so many companies seem to ignore it."	t5_2ty3s	True

1342645043.0	ws3i5	Why I will NEVER kill an unarmed survivor again:	GretSeat	650	89	375	"Last night in my Twitch Stream my friends and I had found a bus and fixed it up and ran it down the coast to pick up random new survivors and ""tour"" them around Chernarus. 

So we found this one unarmed guy and we yelled at him to ""GET IN THE FUCKING BUS"" he said ""Can we pick up my friend?"" I said ""SURE! :D"" 

At this point my friends are saying ""LOL HE'S OUR SLAVE, WE ARE GOING TO MURDER HIM"" 

And I'm saying ""Don't be a fucking dick, come on, these guys are cool""

We pick up the other guy, fend off zombies, they are genuinely having fun with our bus tours as we get into character ""And on your left, you'll see Elektro Fire Station, now if you get out, we can take a tour of it"" etc etc.

We even made it to Cherno Church and had a sermon. I told everyone on skype ""Okay, stand in the pews and salute"" so we did and one guy stood at the podium and spoke some words over direct chat. Then one guy rolled around on the floor, and we had an exorcism! We shouted ""Amen!"" and other words of praise, then got back on the bus. (that was probably my favorite part)

We bring them to a grocery store and get them Czech backpacks to which they ask ""What are these for?"" 

...

They were NEW to the game.

Didn't even know what a backpack was...

They even said ""It's been two days and we haven't seen a single weapon yet...""

Apparently they have been spawning and getting to a town and people murder them before they could do anything!

So we finally tell them about the backpacks and how to use them, then we depart.

They jump on the stream and watch it (hearing our skype call and my friends saying how they want to kill them because they don't trust them)

The new guys chime in and say ""Dude, we aren't going to kill you, we are actually having fun""

We get to Berezino and get to the military tents.

They find their first guns!

A M16A2 for one guy, and a M1014 for the other.

They both shoot some zombies, and then say ""Thank you guys so much! We have to head to bed now, but thank you again so much!""

It literally made me feel like a good person.

They said ""Where is a good place to log out?""

We let them know, they get into a tent, log out, and I couldn't help but think...

""How many other NEW survivors are there out there, that HAVEN'T EVEN EXPERIENCED THE GAME YET because of people shooting them on sight...""

That moment forever changed the way I play DayZ.

Video of the who bus tour is here: http://www.twitch.tv/gretseat/b/325312093

1371111735.0	1g99dn	Complainers: Do you actually know what a game engine is?	jimmysaint13	755	221	333	"After reading through much of the comment sections on what's been shown at E3 so far, I'm seeing a recurring trend. People complaining about ""the engine"" and how ""the engine"" looks like it's hardly been worked on and how ""the engine"" looks basically untouched from Arma 2.

Do you *actually* know what a game engine is? What it does? Probably most importantly, the *different parts* of a game engine?

A Game Engine is basically everything that ISN'T art assets. Models, textures and sounds are not part of an engine. 

Game Engine parts can be split into two distinct groups, the Visual (everything that the player actually sees) and the Logical (everything ""under the hood"").

**Visual**

* Rendering engine (how the game actually draws pixels on the screen)
* Physics and Collision Detection
* Sound (NOT the sounds themselves, how the game delivers the sounds)
* Animation (NOT the animations themselves, how the game handles animation)

**Logical**

* Scripting
* AI
* Networking (netcode)
* Streaming (data flow, not necessarily through a network)
* Memory management
* Threading (putting the game processes in task threads a processor can work with)

Now, because there are so many distinct parts of an engine, this means that game engines have a degree of modularity. Think of the Source engine. The Source engine was first released to the public back in 2004 with Counter Strike: Source, and hasn't been completely re-written yet. They HAVE replaced almost every piece of the engine since 2004, but they have done so incrementally across their releases. Look at the difference between Half Life 2 and Episode 2. Look at the difference between Counter Strike: Source and Global Offensive. Big, noticeable differences there, but they're all running Source.

Why do I bring this up? To show you that there are a LOT more pieces to a Game Engine than you probably realize. Most of the pieces in the Logical category you don't really even notice all that much unless there is a SERIOUS problem. 

I can pretty much *guarantee* you the majority of the time spent developing the SA thus far has been on the netcode. There was literally NOTHING they could salvage from the old netcode as it is a 100% completely different model. ARMA 2's netcode works as sort of a peer-to-peer system where all players were sharing data directly with each other, with the server basically just making sure everything was synced up. In the new C/S netcode, the server handles most of the work and basically just receives commands from the client and sends back results.

There have been improvements in other areas as well, it's just that the one that's really been most obviously improved is the renderer. We see the completely re-done inventory system (with placeholder graphics). 

We see that the game handles itself MUCH smoother, most likely due to vast improvements in the scripting, memory management, and threading departments. The game now runs much more efficiently. People have been complaining that what we've seen looks laggy, but that's because at E3 they are running the server and game on the same box. You would NEVER have been able to do that with DayZ Mod.

I wrote this up because I *really* feel like the majority of people complaining have no idea what a Game Engine is, what it does, and what goes into making one. Hopefully this helps a bit."	t5_2ty3s	True

I froze, belly in the grass, in the shadow of a nearby tree, and felt suddenly completely exposed. I stared at the shifting grasses, the nearby barracks, seeing nothing, having heard only that vaguely British accent somewhere to my left. Bricks were indeed shat. Frozen for a long instant, I figured I had nothing to lose.

""..Friendly!""

""Right. I'm not going to shoot you, then. Are you going to shoot at me?""

Another look at my screen, filled with nothing but buildings, tall grass and omnipresent danger.

""Hell no. I can't even see you, honestly.""

A figure melted up from the grass barely ten feet away, swathed in grassy camouflage, with a ridiculously dangerous rifle leveled at me. The rifle lowered after a moment, and he crept closer, cocky grin on his voice.

""Good to hear. Wanna go loot that barracks?""

""I am -so- down for this. I was expecting to get my head blown off. Again.""

Laughter from my ghostly, grassy friend.

""You're the first one I didn't. Normally I kill everybody. Let's go.""

...

Things were going remarkably well. I'd been gifted some nice camouflage, and was glad to at least be rid of that damned baseball cap. We stared at the airfield, at the edge of the treeline, planning our next move.

From behind me, a slow, haunting growl turned into a hoarse scream. The zeds had caught my scent.

""Go, RUN!"" from the ghostly stranger. We ripped through the trees, and onto the hot asphalt of the runway. On cue, high powered shots rang out as we broke cover, from the tallest tower of the airport. Ricochets pinged off the runway as we sprinted for cover, howling at our heels and hot bullets trying for our heads driving us at a dead run. We dove for cover behind the tall steel of the hangers, turned and pistoled down our undead pursuers.

Immediately we were on the hunt, circling around the rear of the hangers, keeping that tower out of our view as we closed the gap. Hanger after hanger flowed by, as I trailed behind the ghilli-suited sniper, following his lead completely. We were probably going to die, but for once, I wasn't going to die alone.

We darted, building to building, closer and closer to the tall concrete fire station, the most likely spot our unfriendly shooter had fired from. If I closed the gap on him, I'd put 7 1911 rounds into his head for his troubles.

Into the building, and up the horribly cramped spiral stairs, up and up, out the window, to the tower's peak...

...Nothing. Barren. Our shooter had vanished without a trace. We laid on the hot roofing, and scanned the horizon, squinting at our monitors like 80 year old men reading the fine print, for some sign.

Crawling along the front of the hangers, back toward his tower, was a zombie. In a backpack. With a gun. We didn't need more than a second to both rise to one knee, sight in, and unleash a vengeful volley upon him. Blood sprayed from his chest, a scream rang out, and he disappeared between two hangers. His rifle discharged in his panic, and we stared grimly from atop the roost as the zeds turned, and shambled madly into the gap.

The screaming went on longer than we both expected.

...

Things had gone, as it happened, quite badly. The rest of my benevolent, murderous friend's squadron had arrived. For an hour, we dominated the airfield. The barracks were picked clean, and we were riding high on volumes of loot and quite ready to crack open a few tins of sardines.

Then a volley ripped apart the ATC tower. Two men went down in there, ripped apart by bullets and shattering glass. I sprinted for the barracks, and dove into the ceramic tiles of the shower stalls as a grenade ripped apart the front entrance. I heard a string of curses over the radio, as a silenced bullet ripped through my newest friend's leg, and he toppled into the grass.

Dust from the explosion covering me, I aimed down the sight of my shotgun, waiting for anyone foolish and greedy enough to come investigate my corpse. I didn't breathe, I didn't speak, only listened to the radio as my newfound compatriots panicked, cursed, and scattered in different directions.

Gunfire again, now from the opposite side of the airfield. At least two, maybe three different guns going off, answered from the far end once again. We'd gotten in the middle of two other squads, been picked apart, and now they were fighting over the scraps.

Silence, as tense as gritted teeth, broken only by wild, maddening panic every time a shot rang out. It seemed to last for hours.

I must have passed out from exertion, or exhaustion. I rousted again, to the dead silence of the airfield, as calm as it ever was. Cautiously, in a dead whisper, I tried the radio.

""Anyone alive out there?""

A long pause.

""Still alive... bleeding bad. Can't walk. Can you find me?""

Same voice that challenged me barely a few hours ago, rifle at my head. Same man who left me live, after racking up a sociopathic kill count in the high eighties.

""Hell yes, man. I'm coming for you.""

Out of the barracks, slow and quick, his groans led me past the fence, around the gate. He could barely see. Spinning, trying to orient myself, to make sense of where he said he was...

Teeth. Teeth and clawing hands and guttural roars that never stopped. I snarled in response, and the first zed's head exploded to my shotgun's answering roar. They came from all directions, and I had no escape. Again and again, gore erupted from the howling runners as I put them down. The shotgun's roar too soon made that hollow, stomach-sinking 'click', and my pistol was in my hand, just as teeth snapped into my ankle. I screamed, hearing my bones crunch more than I felt them, and put two rounds through the crawler's left ear.

Panic and adrenaline coupled with quickly mounting agony, I wrapped my shattered ankle, tight as a drum. Pulling the cap off the morphine with my teeth, I jammed it into my leg without a moment's pause. I should have been screaming, down and useless, except for one thing.

""I can see you, mate... Yer right there..""

I stood, and ignored the white fire in my leg. Ignoring the bites on my arms, and back, I limped along the fence, leaning on it more than walking on my own.

Around the corner, and I saw that bundle of grass. The grass was bloody, and a pile of zeds lay all around him. The rifle barrel was jammed through the mouth of the nearest, and he had his boot knife out and readied, despite the blood covering his face, and eyes.

I collapsed next to him, and stabbed him with my last needles, binding the worst of his wounds. He couldn't stop smiling, despite blood-caked face, the dozens of bites, and a fractured arm. Still binding the worst bite on his leg, I gasped softly.

""Hell's so funny, man?""

He wiped his chin, smearing blood and dirt across his cheek, and pointed.

Twenty feet away, lying against the steel fencing, discarded and abandoned, lay a dirt bike.

""S'our lucky day, mate... Yer drivin'.""

[We biked away, my 2595 blood to his 443, vision blurred, out of morphine, one bandage left, with four clips of M1911 ammo between us.

Don't shoot a stranger every time. Sometimes, and yes, rarely, they will save your damn life.]

1.If your victim altf4's,look at the chat where it says ""player (my victim was named militia) lost connection""

2.go out of the game and write his name down

3.Download dayzcommander at www.dayzcommander.com

4.go to your dayzcommander friendslist and write his name over there,and rapidly press refresh

5.you can see which server he is on and when he joins

1361217339.0	18rorq	So I just died and something hit me. 	Break-	637	115	138	"I recently died, only after 3 days but a great 3 days. 3 days in which I'd killed 5 bandits and 8 survivors. 13 times I had won the battle of survival of the fittest, 13 times I'd outfoxed the enemy and came out on top. It wasn't about a ""number"" more the fact that I had survived 13 hostile encounters with the enemy and lived to tell the tale. I had been shot to within an inch of my life at least twice, had my legs broke even more, and still my character had pulled through, until last night. 

Then it hit me, when I died I wasn't angry or upset about losing my gear, I was upset about losing my character. Sounds stupid, but I build  up a relationship with my current characters. When I start out, I don't really care for them, I'm not bothered if they get shot or starve to death. But the more I do, and the more experiences/near death encounters I have, I find myself getting attached to the character more and more. Situations I'd get stuck into with a fresh spawn, seem too risky to do with a seasoned character, not because I might lose my M4 Holo, or DMR, but because all of his story I've built up will end and I'll be left with some dude on the coast who means nothing to me. 

This might sound a little strange, pretty dramatic and over the top, but I'm wondering if anyone else feels the same about their characters story? 

Also, what cool features relating to this could be implemented in the standalone? Maybe a diary, where you can take photo's (screenshots) and jot down things that happened to you for your current character? Diary's would be loot-able after you kill a player, and you could read through them. I myself am a bandit, but I think I'd think twice about killing a none hostile player if I read through his diary after I'd shot him. I suppose it would add a personal touch which Dayz hasn't got at the minute.  "	t5_2ty3s	True

THEN

Ok lets get a little back story out for those of you who have not been around dayz for very long. In-case you did not know dayz became popular due to the fact it was the first zombie survival game that did things well the way dayz does it, and here is something a large amount of game reviews at the time stated was the only reason it was popular, it was the first game ever that you could login to ANY server and have the same character, gear, location, etc. That was due to the central Hive database that Every server connected to. This unified server system made people love DayZ even more. For those of you who are wondering the time frame I am talking about, I am referring to the very early stages of dayz, right around the end of april and mid may.

At the time what made dayz so amazing was the thrill of trying to survive with just what you find, and of course the hunt of trying to find a vehicle when less then 50 servers had vehicles and less then like 10 had helis, People were simply in love with trying to find the best possible loot and set up a tent base. A vehicle at the time seemed like an endgame as it saved you from the countless hours of back and fourth between airfields your base and cities. DayZ was simply more about surviving, And from what I can tell what Dean (Rocket) truly wants with DayZ.


NOW

Now the whole Idea of dayz has changed, most of the old players who made dayz big are gone, and its new players thinking that what dayz is now, is how it has always been. The central Hive is pretty much none existent, logging into pretty much every server will cause you to spawn with a new character and new gear. So right there a huge part of what dayz used to be is changed now.

I know this is going to get me a lot of hate, But here goes.

And now onto what is the worst thing to happen for dayz ""Private Hives"". Private Hives have ruined pretty much everything that made DayZ, DayZ. Surviving really is not a thing anymore when you have server admins putting 200+ vehicles on the server which take away from that sort of endgame like goal of finding a vehicle, You now have server admins with the ability to simply repair vehicles to full with the press of a button, and they now have the ability to spawn vehicles where ever they damn well please which is for sure not what dayz was about.

Now onto admins giving weapons, changing starting loadout, and more. Allowing admins the ability to give weapons, heal, and do what ever to players is also something that ruined what dayz was all about. You used to have to spend hours upon hours trying to find loot in military barracks and heli crashes (even though they used to almost never work) just to find say a DMR, If you had a squad with a DMR, a winchester, and an M4/M16 or two you were king You had Fun in your group as you knew that the 5 hours you just spent finding that DMR was worth it. Now that is all gone, server admins can simply give them selves guns weapons what ever, and give other players what ever they feel like. Heck you can now change it so instead of starting with basic survival gear you start with the best possible stuff in the game.... That makes playing pretty much pointless. Now this leads me onto what a decent amount of servers are doing, ""donate for an as50"" or ""donate for a loadout of your choice"" that sounds an awful lot like pay to win which is something no one expected dayz to ever be. Now granted you will say well not all servers do it. Well your right but a decent amount do, do it which is the reason why i am mentioning it.

And onto my last point.

NEW PLAYERS

Right now is the worst time for players to pickup dayz for the first time as not only do they have to get used to the clunky inventory system, and just learn what dayz is. They now have to choose from what map and what mod of dayz mod they want to play, which as a new player you might not even choose actual dayz on chernarus. You then have to choose one of the 6 thousand servers that are out there knowing that what ever server you join is the one you will need to stick with, but not only that you need to hope you pick a server that 1 the admin is not going to be abusing his powers, and 2 a server that is not going to change maps and you lose all your effort, and 3 one that is not going to be cancelled a week from now and once again you lose all your stuff. Which going back to the THEN part of this section is something you did NOT have to worry about when dayz was more towards rockets vision.

And onto the topic

WHY PEOPLE WILL BE DISAPPOINTED

Lets talk about the title and why I said ""Why The Later SA Is Released, The More People Will Be Disappointed"" As you may or may not know rocket is developing the game he had always dreamed dayz could be, So that game will be more towards what dayz used to be and not what it has become now. That means at least for a decent amount of time in the beginning, there will be NO private hives, there will simply be the one main Hive that they run. He has said that he does not want to do private hives at first because they want to simply work on fixing bugs and new features at first which will result in possibly large changes that will need to be made on a daily basis to the Hive. No private hives means no ""200+ vehicle servers"", no ""admin maps"", no player tracking, no special starting gear and loadouts, no donator classes, no plunking down vehicles where ever you please, none of that. That right there is huge news to those who think dayz SA is going to be like dayz now just with improvements. Personally I hope Rocket does not allow private hives at all for at least a year, It simply changes the idea of DayZ too much, Don't get me wrong I hope admins get some more tools then they get on a official server now, but I hope to what ever god you believe in they don't get all of what they get now.

Now for those of you who only play say taviana or only play dayz 2017 and think normal dayz on chernarus sucks, well you are also going to be out of luck as rocket has also stated that modding will NOT be allowed for the foreseeable future as well going back to private hives, they simply want to work on fixing issues and working on improvements to dayz rather then supporting people trying to day one make 20 maps. I am also personally very happy about this news too as no modding means no extra maps which means no private hives will need to be made.


From what I just said a lot of you might be thinking to yourself oh what he said is false, SA is going to have everything well its simply not. There are plenty of places for you to look to find sources for what I said, Its all been said by rocket. Plain and simple.

Now for those of you who understand what I have said can think to yourself, those who have not played dayz way back when and realize what its truly about may not like SA when it comes out as its simply not going to have the million maps and private hives with admin maps and tools. That right there I know for a fact will make a lot of people hate SA.

Then of course the longer the mod is out and SA is still just ""in development"" players will be buying arma 2 for dayz mod playing it and getting in their heads that is what dayz is and that is what they can expect from SA.


If SA would have released back when Rocket said (end of 2012) more people most likely would have expected what they got as even though its only been 3 months private hives were not as big then as they are now, and since then a lot more mods and maps have come out which have changed dayz even more.

This was really important to me because it showed they really cared for the community, and when I had to leave due to hardware issues preventing me from playing it anymore, I hoped it's successor which happened to be DayZ would have a similar atmosphere.

I asked during the Q&amp;A session at PAX what engine enhancements you were bringing over from ARMA III into DayZ Standalone, and since we were running out of time you told me to ask again here and you'd elaborate further. My dad just recently bought ARMA III and it looks amazing - when you get around to seeing this, could you go over some of the cool engine upgrades you've already put in from it and which you are looking to add as well?

Thanks so much for your time! I loved the panel at PAX, and good luck and godspeed on the standalone.

EDIT: Since a few of the comments seem to be very focused on the weapon raising/lowering and other gameplay aspects, I'd like to mention that I'm more interested in tech questions, such as day/night cycles, lighting, physics, and engine elements. Thanks!"	t5_2ty3s	True

We had 4 bullets between us, and no medical supplies. So, instead of killing this guy, I decide to go up, tell him to crouch, turn around, and drop his pills.


The person get's on mic, and it turns out to be a woman, and I didn't care, so I kept on trying to get her to drop her painkillers ( I was shaking and had none ). She started getting uppity, and zombies were coming by. We both spent our two bullets trying to stay alive, so we decided to leave anyway.


As we are about to get back in our boat, I see that she's bleeding, so I bandage her and ask if she wants a lift anywhere. She declines, and intentionally bleeds out.


An hour passes without seeing her, and out of no where she says that 'I should read up on feminism' and was saying that I was being misogynistic for attempting to assert power over a woman ( mugging ), despite the fact that I started the mugging well before I knew her gender. I told her that I mug people quite often, that it had nothing to do with her gender, and that she should stop feeling entitled over her gender, something that is pretty ironic for a feminist to believe, anyway.


She called me a 'sexist bigot' and then left. That really pissed me off. Has anything like this ever happened to you?"	t5_2ty3s	True

It feels like a lot of content creators are worried about downvotes or community having a go at them for killing innocent players. They end up conforming and tell us lies most people here want to hear. Every other title is along the lines of: ""We are killing 4 bandits that were shooting new spawns"" or ""somebody was killing unarmed players so we killed him"" or ""having fun with bandits"". When you watch the actual video there is no evidence that the ""bandits"" are actually bandits and in most cases the content creators have a bunch of murders themselves. They usually justify their murders with ""I killed some guy who tried to kill me"" or something along the lines. Should not the people they apprehend get the same benefit of the doubt? Like the video I just watched: ""Surrounding, interrogating and executing an infected bandit"" where they established that the new spawn guy they killed is a bandit because he had a heart rate while OP himself had 2 murders and 0 bandit kills and it was 3 vs 1 new spawn.

It feel like most people sugar coat their kills. Instead of titling: ""We found a survivor and decided to fuck with him. Hilarity ensues."" they write: ""We caught a notorious bandit and punished him for millions of deaths he brought to Elektro"". Am I the only one who would rather hear the whole, true story even if the OPs actions are questionable? I just don't like when people lie and even more people fall for their crap.

On top of that, why should anyone even have to justify what they did if being a bandit is a valid choice? Do whatever you want. It's a sandbox game. Just don't make up shit in fear of some criticism from those who don't play like you do. "	t5_2ty3s	True

For those who don't know me, I used to be named Caesar on the Zi servers. I've been a regular player there for a very long time, but no more. I'm from Sweden, so bare with me and my english.

During my time on Zi, I've been both appriciated and hated by admins. As a regular player, I suppose that's what you get, even more when you're a 100% bandit.
As I played a lot on those servers, I've always tried to improve them. That I did with posts on the forums, conversations with the admins. Almost every time, my opinions were never taken seriously, even though I had a lot of players agreed with me. 
One of the bigger issues were the loadouts before breakingpoint, I knew that they killed the servers. You could pay 15 bucks and get a DMR+coyote backpack and some other neat stuff. This made the servers unplayable because of all the coastal banditry. As a newspawn you could forget getting out of Cherno, Elektro and Kamenka alive. I made a post of this on the forums, where I explained in a really serious way, the problems with the loadouts. My post got deleted and the server owner NoHrt, came into my TS channel and told me that if I ever made such a post again, I'd get banned. I didn't bother talking back to him, since he's banned people before for just talking back to him, which is retarded. 

Once Breaking Point came out, I noticed an increase of this behaviour amongs the admins. Admins would always sit in the helpdesk, being rude to new players that came in and asked questions like ""How does the launcher work"". Admins like Warchief and Robby/Steve could start to laugh and say ""get the fuck out of the helpdesk, figure it out on your own"", if they didn't leave they'd get a temp ban. This resulted in a lot of criticism towards the admins, and they responded with banning every single person who critisized them. I watched all this happen when I was sitting in the general channels talking to people, new and old. So without taking up too many examples, I'd say asking a question to Warchief or Deathlyrage would result in either a conflict, or a kick/ban. I even tried this myself a couple of times, going in with another name and texting a question like ""can my gear be transferred to the other hive?"". 

Once Breaking Point was out, me as a person was not appriciated, since all they cared about was good PR. Banning everyone that didn't like Breaking Point was the right way to go according to most admins. And since I asked a lot of questions and tried to change the community, I was kicked and temp banned A LOT of times.
The main problem came in when a player called Nemesis was banned, he was a former admin on Zi and once of the co-devs of Breaking Point. He has also been a buddy of Deathlyrage's for years. He got banned for gloating on side chat etc, totally legitimate. Once he got banned, Deathlyrage gave him his own hive, called AGN. This hive could be joined through the launcher. There were different admins there and such. Nemesis offered me admin there, and I said yes. Once I got admin on AGN, the general attitude from Zi-admins got really bad. I could randomly be kicked out of the Zi servers with the message ""Shouldn't you be on your hive?"" and ""Oops, sorry!"". When I then went into the helpdesk and explain this I got temp banned from TS without and explaination. 
As a result of this, I made a post on the forums where I once again, wrote about how I and alot of other players felt about the admins behaviour. Let's just say, the post was not appriciated. Five minutes after the post, Deathlyrage came into my own teamspeak and started raging, calling me names and telling me that the AGN servers were done. I explained that I didn't give two fucks about the AGN servers, and he can kill them if he wants, or he can respond to my post on the forums like a man. Not too unexpected, he killed the servers and deleted my post on the forums. I then made a post where I questioned the thing that my post had been deleted, it also got deleted. A few players noticed this, and messaged me on my own TS, that their time on Zi was over, and I was welcome to follow them. I declined, and hoped that I could talk to some admins about this, and maybe get a different response. I talked to Griffin, who is the youngest admin on the hive, he's like 13 and acts like a girl on her period. He said that my post had been deleted because of the bad language used in the post, where I had written ""Come on admins, stop being assholes to people, be niced guys instead!"". Then I got a little pissed off on the lies, so I renamed myself ""potty mouth"" in teamspeak, and got temp banned for trolling. A few days later I got onto TS again to say hello to people and check if anyone wanted to play with me. I instantly got a message from Deathlyrage that says ""Oh, it's Caesar. You son of a bitch"" and then got permabanned ingame, on teamspeak and on the forums. 
I changed my IP a couple of times and eavsdropped in the helpdesk where a lot of people asked why I got banned. There I was accused of basically threatning to kill people IRL, ""stealing"" breaking point and making my own community, and much more bullshit that had just been made up to make people not ask questions. I was banned because I critisized the community and it's admins. 

That's where my story with Zi ends. It's obvious that complaining on the servers is not allowed. Your complaints will be ignored or result in a ban if they're too legit and/or sensitive. 
I don't make this post to cry out in public and try to gain sympathy. I make this post to really warn people about this hive. It is, as the name states, and infection. The hive and the community is infected by bad admins, bad developing and in general bad servers. If you are a regular players on Zi, you probably know about these issues, if you aren't aware of them let me give you a few tips. Don't make a post on the forums where you try to change anything, don't talk to admins without being extremely polite, don't do anything else than play the game. 

One thing that I also want to mention is that thing that has been up on reddit already, where the launcher some how retrieves your CD-key. I have some knowledge of this, and I'd be careful. Deathlyrage the server Dev never wanted to talk to me about this, he literally asked me to stop talking about it. I've made posts about the idiocy about having a code that takes your CD-key AND checking if you have cheat engine installer on your computer. The posts got deleted, and I got some serious conversations with the admins for once. They didn't want to talk about the thing with the CD-key, but they were willing to talk about the code that checks your computer for Cheat Engine. Apparently, they didn't want hackers of ANY KIND on their servers. They considered it to be immoral to hack or cheat in any games. So even if I used cheat engine to let's say cheat on GTA IV, I wouldn't be welcome on their servers, because it's immoral to cheat. 
My opinion was that they shouldn't give two fucks about where or on what I cheat, unless it's on their own servers. This opinion was ignored, and I believe the code is still inside the launcher.

Some of the things that don't have anything to do with the admins, that I hate about BP that also made me a little happy that I'm banned and now play on a similar mod. I'm now rid of the totally illogical Zombie sounds, the fucking fog that's so thick that you can barely see your own hands during night, the totally over the top spawning of guns. 

Also want to declare that this no admin abuse post, just to inform you that the admins and the community is really shitty.

Peace out!

What if a zombie's lifecycle started before it was even a zombie?"	icebawkz	514	85	233	"Rocket has stated multiple times, but most publicly in his AMA that he intends to add zombie lifecycles to the game in order to make it more realistic. By this he means that a fresher spawned zombie would has increased senses, speed, and abilities while older zombies would be more decrepit, slow, and blundering. But what I am proposing is to start a zombie's lifecycle before it even becomes a zombie.

I am referring, of course, to players' characters turning into zombies.


Of course these **would not**:

* Rise from the Dead (why? because rocket prefers them to be ""infected"" not ""reanimated"")

* Be controllable 

* Be able to utilize any equipment 

* Retain all of their equipment after turning. (why? mainly because loot respawns so this would bring about inflated numbers of loot spawns, but also because realistically[I use this word loosely] a zombie would probably thrash around and not be all too happy about being a pack mule for what it can't use)

*Have a backpack of any kind, any items on them would be in the inventory, not backpack. (why? see the reason above)


But they **would**:

* Retain all *crippling* damage sustained (so they would be returned to full zombie health but if they had been shot in the knee prior to infection they wouldn't just stand up and sprint around, they would be relegated to limping or crawling)

* Add another facet to the reality and depth of this game!

* Be a *realistic* source of walking loot!

*Be more attentive than normal zombies, at least initially (lifecycle effects).


Some Problems that have been brought up and my attempts to resolve them:

* ~~**Rocket prefers infection, not re-animation!**~~ [Fixed, I adjusted the idea to accommodate rocket's idea of zombies.]

* **All loot cannot be retained after turning, this would provide too much loot and throw off the current balance!** [agreed! I actually didn't think of this one but i think it can be quite easily solved. Rocket could assign ""Retention Percentages"" to all items in the game and when a player turned the virtual dice would be rolled, according to these percentages, and determine whether the item is dropped or kept [keep in mind that the backpack and all items in the backpack would already be dropped so we are only talking about items either currently equipped or in the character's immediate inventory]. If they are dropped, then they are dropped [no shit] and will de-spawn like any other normal item. If they are kept, then after the zombie is killed those items will appear just like if you had killed a player. Some Theoretical ""Retention Percentages"" [keep in mind that they would have to be scaled to accommodate an item's rarity not value] AS50 - 1-2%, Bandage - 75-85%, Lee Enfield - 40-60%, Lee Enfield Mags - 50-70%, etc.

* **How would you get infected?** [By zombies of course! I don't think every hit from a zombie should result in infection, then everyone would die and that would be stupid, I think it should run on a probability system as well. Let's say a 10% infection rate? [this could also degrade or enhance with other lifecycle effects for extra server starin!] 10% means most people would get infected but if you get swarmed there is not much hope for you.

* **The Transition!** [I would assume something similar to being knocked unconscious and then dying(on your screen) or getting back up and attacking your buddies(on their screen). your backpack and all dropped items[refer to above] would be placed on the ground and then your character would just be a zombie!]

* **Stopping the transition?** [this is an interesting one. of course a bullet could do the trick, you could have your friends put you down[or put yourself down?] But should there also be a vaccine? or an antivirus? if so this could add another morsel of reality because since the antivirus was too late to stop the infection we can assume that it has not been widely distributed yet! this means that it would only be found at military medical tents [think balota airstrip, cherno medical tents, not hospitals] or Military transport trucks [they were trying to deliver it but got killed so the truck and antivirus are there!]]

* **If someone turns into a zombie out in the middle of nowhere, right now with the current mechanics their ""zombie-player"" would despawn and not be saved to the server making all this pointless!** [yeah I know. I would like to see zombies out in the woods as it would make the game more realistic and challenging but the 300m spawning radius makes sense for server strain and I am not going to whine about what I know is a tough choice. Maybe with better spawning mechanics, maybe when server strain is figured out, then maybe this can be looked at and zombies' positions could be saved to a server and their spawns wouldn't need to be dependent on a player's presence.]

* **The zombie population in Cherno/Elektro would be Huge!** [I know ;) ]

* **Extra server strain/load/lag!** [I got nothing for this one...sorry]


Before you bash or support the idea, run through a scenario in your head! Imagine it!

For the Imaginatively impaired I have provided a couple that I envisioned!

* You and your friend are raiding Cherno, he fires off a shot to drop a bandit but gets swarmed by zombies. Being the pragmatic, survival oriented, survivor that you are you make the choice to save yourself! the next day when you log back on and are wandering through Cherno you see your friend! but he is now a zombie and wants to make you the same!

* You are on the north Ridge of Stary Sobor patrolling the horizon with your thermal scope when a blip of dark reddish orange catches your eye. Your heart races as you notice the outline of an AS50 over his shoulder and think about retreating before he sees you but his awkward stance and slow movement piques your curiosity so you observe him more closely with your NVGs and notice that he is in fact an equipped person with an AS50 and a ghillie suit but he is a zombie! Score! Bam goes your M107 and you score some awesome loot!

Again, Just another idea that I had to make the game just *that* much more realistic. You can love it or Hate it but I thank you for reading my opinion!

Feel free to share yours!

EDIT: grammar, spelling, etc.

EDIT 2: It has been brought to my attention that Rocket prefers a kind of non-reanimation zombie style. I respect this as it is more realistic and believe that this idea could be converted, without breaking a sweat, to one without re-animation

EDIT 3: I reworked the whole idea to accommodate Rocket's view of zombies and added a section for resolving problems that this idea brings up.

EDIT(S) 4,5,and 6: Formatting, Grammar, spelling, etc.

1340762665.0	vnvtv	I don't mean to whore myself in this title, but for the love of god, please upvote if you too have a problem with the bone breaking system! It NEEDS to be fixed.	bossmcsauce	632	206	203	"TLDR: Bone breaking in this game is utterly fucking worthless as a game mechanic, and needs to be removed entirely, or dialed back to the point where it doesn't make the game unplayable.

I cannot even express in words how frustrated I have become at the absolute absurdity of broken legs in this game... I keep breaking my legs in the most bullshit ways, and have read endless posts on the forums of other people breaking their legs in all sorts of ways, including, but not limited to: climbing up/down ladders, going prone near solid objects, falling any distance even as small as a few inches off the front step of a house, getting bumped by another player who apparently weighs thousands of pounds, getting scratched by zombies that are as far as 15 or 20 feet away (out of 5 times I've been hit by zombies since update a few days ago, I have had my legs broken twice).

Today, I was crawling around in a house, looking for loot, and as I started to crawl backwards, my legs bumped into a wall, and shattered. Now I am laying, crippled, no hospitals or morphine for miles and miles, waiting to die face down in the mud. 

This wouldn't be so bad if not for a couple of key points-

1- I have never broken a bone in my life, and I ride BMX, occasionally rock climb, have been skying, sledding, and jump off of all kinds of things taller than 3 or 4 feet. I jump 5 feet to flat concrete on my bmx bike on a regular basis, and have never shattered both my legs so badly that I cannot walk. I have also never seen anybody get their legs smashed by somebody open-palm striking them. Broken legs in this game are the most unrealistic thing I have seen so far... even more unrealistic than the idea of zombies, as those do exist in certain parts of the animal kingdom. 

2- The fact that shattered legs are added as a mechanic to enhance realism, but are magically cured with morphine injections is ludicrous, however, I will leave that be for the moment. My biggest qualm with broken legs in this game, second to the fact that they CAN get broken, is that the supplies needed to fix them are almost impossible to find after this most recent update, which wouldn't be so bad if your legs didn't break every time you crawled backwards, stood up, sat down, climbed a ladder, or did most any other action necessary to play the game.

I agree- It should be hard to fix broken legs. That is a realistic thing. That being said though, it is really fucking hard to actually break your legs in real life in the first place.

In conclusion, I feel like bone breaking is a good idea overall. I don't want to sound like I think the developers are stupid for trying to incorporate this idea into the game. I feel like the system is a little bit too harsh though, as being unable to stand makes the game almost impossible. For instance, while prone, it's damn near impossible to get in/out of houses, leaving you no way to really find morphine even if you happen to be near places where you might find loot... I think that it needs to be removed from the game entirely, OR perhaps allow you to still walk around, just not sprint, or stand fully upright. If you could only walk in the crouched position, that would be fine, as well as making the solution more common, or making it a time-based thing. Perhaps you're bones stay broken for a specific amount of time depending on the intensity of the injury. perhaps the time passage allows you to move better in increments as you get closer to full recovery... i dunno. Point is, I'm tired of breaking my legs... that's all...


EDIT- I really dont even mind the whole morphine situation so much, I just wish my character's body had a little more integrity than a 130 year old man with osteoporosis.. lol."	t5_2ty3s	True

^^^^.

**Do you think SA will come before April?**

Yes I think so, but anything could happen and usually does. We'll know more when the results of the tech test are out. Any dates before then would be pure speculation, and my last speculation didn't work out so good.

^^^^.

**Any possible date or time frame for the closed test? Last week you said it would start imminently, so I was wondering how soon that was.**

We're down to the last few things to fix before the first test servers pop online and we run the first full servers. Slowly we'll hand out the first keys and get a few servers running. Then we will reassess. It could go really well and we open up quickly, or it could go badly.
Don't expect the tech test to be fun, or very pretty. It's a tech test, any game design that makes it into that will be a bonus.

^^^^.

**Rocket, when ArmA 3 comes out, are you going to mod DayZ into it or let the community do it?**

My real hope, is that the next ""DayZ"" comes out and get's it's big break in ArmA3. I made a space mod for ArmA2 that I never released, maybe I might make that for ArmA3! I guess someone will mod DayZ for ArmA3 and it will probably be great for it, that's the awesome thing about this community.

^^^^.

**I was wondering if you plan to implement a sewer system via instancing in the major cities of Chernarus+?**

I really want too. We'd need to do some magic though (or instancing... but only I am really happy with instancing as a solution at the moment! the programmers want to do it properly).

^^^^.

**Will the ragdoll system be initially available in the SA or you'll implement it later? I have fears about this because of the complexity of the RV engine. Keep up the good work, Rock on!**

No ragdoll currently, it is a significant amount of work and one we haven't done yet. We looked at it, even tried some, but it was just going to cause far too much delay.

^^^^.

**Is the idea of making security systems for underground structures still in?
I remember you mentioned that if you ever get objects as their own entities going that you might be able to ""program"" them. .. i.e. grenade attached to a door etc**

I'm playing a lot of Space Station 13 at the moment and it is giving me some tremendous inspiration for ideas for base construction. But expect this more towards the end of this year. We have much ground to cover first.

^^^^.

**Has a chainsaw been added yet?**

Nope, not yet. We've only really started on item art asset development recently, as we just confirmed all our desired item architectural changes are possible.

^^^^.

**Do you have anything in the works for more obtainable skins like the hero and bandit skins?**

You can cloth yourself in custom items for each body part. So effectively, you create your own skin. We're still looking at options for humanity and we aren't tied down to a system yet.

^^^^.

**can we expect some unannounced surprises in the standalone release?**

Absolutely. For the next 12 months at least, probably beyond that.

^^^^.

**From my point of view, one big issue of Arma/the mod is that a camo-player being 20 meters away is way harder to see, then the same player being 400 meters away. Same goes for loot on current crash-sites etc. Mainly because of the rendering distance of vegetation. Are you aware, and do you agree that this is quite important? Any plans on how to address it?**

It is important, we're aware of it - but we haven't got it planned to be addressed yet. We're still on these major, sweeping, architectural changes.

^^^^.

**I've been quite impressed by seattle map in TOH. Would it be possible to rework the map to make it playable in DayZ?**

It's very impressive map, but the issue is more it was designed for something specific (helicopters). DayZ needs interiors, they're really important. I think DayZ needs a new map, BI made, that features a western city... let's just say I have plans :)

^^^^.

**Are we going to be able to hide from zombies in trees and bushes? Swarm of zombies, I'll just sit in this bush until they give up.**

Yes. Although for a few months expect these new mechanics to spontaneously break and hilarity ensu

^^^^.

**Has Marek Spanel (CEO at Bohemia Interactive Studio for those who don't know) played the mod/sa and given any feedback on it?**

Marek has been extremely involved since very early in DayZ (since shortly after it's release really). He continues to be a key contributing member of the team both at a management/steering level and also with design.

^^^^.

**How do you deal with the stress of the game? When you get overloaded with Questions and the difficulties with the development etc, whats your method of keeping things together?**

Bizzarely enough, aside from running or one of my hobbies like mountaineering or wakeboarding (which I can rarely do here) - the greatest stress relief comes from modding someone elses game.
I love KSP and love modding for it, and I am really in love with Space Station 13 at the moment, and loving making new maps and editing/modding it. There is something inherently beautiful about modding that I just love.
I probably was having a slow-moving nervous breakdown towards the end of last year, really. But this year has been great, the progress has been outstanding and all the huge gambles we took architecturally last year have started paying off.

^^^^.

**With implementation of clothing slots, what type of range of clothing has the team discussed and what kind factors have gone in on the decision process? (ex camouflage, body &amp; head armor, degrading rates,)**

All of the above!

^^^^.

**How do you intend to build upon the vehicle system and how you repair vehicles. Will it be a standard hunt for parts or will you be able to remove a few working parts from other damaged vehicles to rebuild your own?**

Not initially, vehicles will remain very, very basic. But later we will add great depth to the parts mechanic something like a ""vehicle construction"" system. This will be our first foray into ""endgame"" type content, after we have stabilized the build.

^^^^.

**Will there still be a 'dot' system and will it potentially still allow ESP hacks (which are hard to detect)?**

I want to remove the crosshair but I suspect we will have it configurable by servers. Same with 3rd person, but no firm decision is made yet we need to test everything out with you guys first. Hacking is something we will have to work on for the life of the product. I.e. forever. We just have to try this new architecture and continually innovate, adapt to the change of pace. That's just the reality of the world.

^^^^.

**Are you still considering underground bases? It was mentioned early on but not so much since.**

Once we have things really stable and solid, like a really good experience (I estimate loosely on my return from Everest in June), I think we will start with base construction. I've been playing A LOT of space station 13 and it has given me some great ideas.

^^^^.

**The end game.
While 'surviving' is a big part of the game, there is a point where you have little more to do apart from hunting down other people or continuing to hoard things. Is there something in the works for people to aspire to? Something like 'If you want to go to this island, you have to survive x days' or another survival based benefit? (even small achievements)
I'm looking it from the perspective of longevity rather than having the game degrade into a FPS with cities, zombies and flares.
tl;dr - I'm geared up rocket, Do I go out shooting people dfens style endlessly or live in the forest like a hermit? Is there something more to aspire to?**

Firstly, once we have DayZ stabilized into something reasonable - we will look at some advanced vehicle stuff. I.e. sort of vehicle construction, adding different parts to vehicles etc...
Then towards the end of the year, probably, looking at base construction as an entirely new game mode.

^^^^.

**Can we expect any new guns/gear upon foundation release?**

yes lots

^^^^.

**Will each gun have their own unique sound in SA? I ask because it can be frustrating not knowing if I'm being shot at by an M24 or a DMR. Knowing the difference would help me know if I should make a break for it or not.**

Ermm... sound isn't something we've played with alot yet. It's something we can easily improve - we want the freedom now to innovate, which means not getting locked down because we created certain content. The pace of our innovation is insane at the moment and is entirely changing the landscape of the future content changes.

^^^^.

**You compare the SA to Minecraft a lot in terms of the foundation release and then content updates thereafter, alpha pricing, etc. Are there any plans in the forseeable future for a one-time or yearly Minecon-style DayZ event?**

Probably, no plans as yet. I would say by June we have a good picture on the success of DayZ as a whole and sometime around then we'll have a good think about the future.

^^^^.

**How long is the invite only SA test going to last before it opens up to the rest of us?**

As long as it takes to smooth out the architectural issues.

^^^^.

**the price**

Cheap for a start, rising in price during development.

^^^^.

**How often will updates come out ?**

Daily/weekly. Pushed through steam as delta updates (&lt;3 you steam!)

^^^^.

**Will there be some kind of report system in case of hackers ?**

TBC, likely something we will have to work on improving for the entire life of the product.

^^^^.

**To what extent will customization go, e.g clothing, character**

clothing, full range of selections: Head, eyes, torso, pants, feet, gloves, vest, backpack.

^^^^.

1341237692.0	vx9lp	Why Punishing Bandits Is a Ridiculous Idea.	Legal_Disclaimer	592	184	666	"So.  Recently I've seen a few posts about punishing bandits and how it could be done and how it's for [the greater good](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUpbOliTHJY).  I'm here to tell you why any restriction on banditry is completely out of context with a post-apocalyptic scenario.  I will frame this argument in two concepts; society and survival.

If you're playing DayZ you most likely live in a developed country.  You can walk/drive to your local grocery store and buy pretty much anything you want at anytime, despite not understanding where your food comes from and how it gets to the market.  Running water is plentiful and easily available to you from the tap, despite your ignorance in locating and purifying it.  If you get sick you can go to the doctor.  You don't have to worry about taking care of yourself.

That's the simultaneous beauty and curse of society.  It's easy to live in a society.  All we have to do is agree certain things are to be frowned upon.  Characteristics of our evolutionary ability to survive are supressed in favor of a collective effort toward that very goal.  We develop consciences and mores which determine our behaviors.  We disdain banditry because it isn't necessary to carry on living anymore.  The goal is no longer survival.  The goal is comfort.

Now imagine if all of this was stripped away over the course of a few weeks.  Food supply would break down.  Electricity would disappear as nuclear, fossil fuel and hydro-electric generators failed.  Resources necessary to survival would become localized and scarce.  Panic and chaos would rule.  People would begin hording resources.

In the United States, there are two guns for every person.  A *lot* of people would die fighting over these resources.  Those who lived through the imminent tribal conflicts and won resources could carry on, for a time.  Those who lived through those conflicts without winning any resources would slowly die of starvation or exposure to the elements.

Most people don't have the skills to survive *any* catastrophic event.  We have become soft as a species.  Throw in a highly aggressive threat such as zombies and resource gathering becomes a mortal trial.  Society disappears and the laws prohibiting behavior with it.  Killing other people for your own sake becomes a necessary normality.

It would, in fact, be easier to kill other people to survive rather than face the population of ravenous, unstoppable killing machines in each town and city.  Of course, it makes sense for people to band together for surival.  This happens in DayZ as it would in real life.  The killings happen too.

I've said this before and I'll say it again.  Everyone in DayZ is a bandit.  People who kill in DayZ and feel remorse or guilt, and then don't loot the body, are shitty bandits.  We have the luxury of emotions because we aren't living through the apocalypse.  Remorse and guilt are rather quaint notions in that situation.

In DayZ, and in real life, you have the ability to choose.  You can band together and scavange for your needs or you can kill people for them.  The difference is in your personal choice.  Don't make the mistake of attaching a non-existing morality to the choice.  Nature is an impartial observer to your fate."	t5_2ty3s	True

1338991244.0	unxqy	Fan at E3 spoke with Rocket about the future of Day-Z		469	57	258	"Taken from [this thread] (http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?noseen=0&amp;threadid=3481582&amp;perpage=40&amp;pagenumber=101#post404348191) over at Something Awful. I take no credit for this other than simply putting it on here from browsing SA, I am not the friend he mentions, just a lurker.

""Hey, I was at E3 today and met Rocket, the developer of this mod. I talked to him for about five minutes about the mod, so I'm just gonna go through how the conversation went.

I first addressed him by saying that I love his mod, and that he should never stop punishing the carebears who want it to be made into a 'fun' game. He laughed, clearly loving that sentiment. I first asked him if he was going to get a team to help him out. He responded that Bohemia Interactive is very supportive of games that don't really have any marketability or exposure, and is willing to take risks in this way on games that may or may not clearly make money right away. I agreed, considering that Arma is basically a simulation engine and not necessarily a game. Because of this attitude, he said, he has been instructed directly to stop his work as a multiplayer designer so that he can focus exclusively on Day Z, and that he believes that Day Z is the first step towards Bohemia gearing up to make it into a full standalone game out of recognition for the opportunity to make something very different and the clear interest people have in it. He went on to say that it being a standalone title is important if only for the sake of consistency and ease of play, as mods are not the most stable or easy-to-use games, and that the only determining factor for the mod's future is the stability of the unpredictable fanbase.

I told him that the fans are playing it in droves, and with great fervor, even in spite of its clearly-alpha state; in fact, on that note, the forums are blowing up with ""WHERES ROCKET"" and bug reports while he's here at E3. He laughed and said he's been trying to not visit the forums while he's gone cuz he knows he's gonna get pissed. I then went ahead and asked him if he thought the mod would end up on Arma 3. He said he'd already sort of ported it to try it out (!!!), and that it works great. The main reason he ""released"" Day Z so early as an alpha was to allow for it to be stress-tested, as it is primarily a network-based game. At this juncture, I asked if he saw it ending up with more players-per-server in the future. He said DEFINITELY, that it's been tested internally and he thinks it could handle between 100-200 players easily (!!!!!). The thought of the anti-bandit rage this would induce gave me a semi. Anyway, he said that the engine was developed for such incredible strains, and that such numbers are in fact a natural fit.

I asked him if he thought he'd be doing away with 'meta' elements, such as server-wide chat and in-game player lists. He said not only is he doing this for sure, but that he's only waiting on the next beta patch of Arma 2 and then it is definitely happening. This excited me greatly. At this point, opportunely enough, I noticed his shirt. He said he'd had a bunch made, but that they didn't ship in time for the show so he had a small batch printed up when he got here so he could wear one. Said he took the idea from 4chan.

For those of you who have not played it, the zombies are not Romero type zombies. They run at you and are not only scary, but challenging, if they see you, you are in trouble. However, there is a counter play mechanic: stealth.

In The Last of Us, you can easily sneak around zombies, as long as you but the effort into not sprinting around like a maniac, and because the zombies are difficult, being able to stealth around and avoid zombie interactions is very satisfying and promotes less of a 'run and gun' game style.

The problem with the dayz zombies is not that they are fast, because this makes sense to me, but that it is nearly impossible to avoid them noticing you. You can be crawling 30 yards away from them and yet you still agro them. This needs to be fixed and can be done so by lowering the super human senses of the zombies. Someone should be able to crouch walk 10 feet behind a zombie, as long as it does not have vision on you, and not agro it.

This would allow zombies to still be fast and powerful, without being broken. What do you think? 

EDIT: This is not entirely related but, should night time severely impaire the vision of zombies? To the extent that you can walk very close to them without agro? Personally I think it seems realistic as well as promoting players to play at night time."	t5_2ty3s	True

There are A LOT of broken things in DayZ. Zombies clipping through walls, detection radius going haywire, ALT-F4ing, hacking admins, et cetera. These need fixing.
What does not need fixing is things like camping bandits, or well invested players spawn camping. DayZ is pretty much intended to be an anti game: its not supposed to be fair, and the odds are against you. In a real zombie apocalypse, people aren't going to leave their shooting position so you can have your chance at getting into a military complex filled with guns.
ARMA 2 is a military simulation. The expansion pack, Operation Arrowhead takes place in a backwards war-torn nation much like Afghanistan. The military of this small country in no match for their opposition, the American and British militaries, and in a one to one fight, the BLUFOR (Americans and Brits) almost always win. Does this need balancing? No. It is a simulation of a real life conflict, much like DayZ is intended to be. 
What I'm getting at here is the suggestions like ""Have a marker that gives a more and more specific location of bandits, based on murder count"" should not even be submitted for debate, as they completely ignore the model of DayZ gameplay, which is really an anti-game, as Rocket called it himself. 
Thank you for reading my little rant, and continue to enjoy the game."	t5_2ty3s	True

Basically zombies would have three states:

Investigate (walking towards a sound made by a player walking, shooting or something else)

Idleing walking around AND

Attacking

There only seems to be the latter two states in the current dayz. Imagine fireing a gun on one side of a town, travelling further into it, then being greeted by zombies all around you.

A similar mechanic kind of exists at the moment with throwable trash and scrap, the introduction of these this additional investigation state would benefit this mechanic.

EDIT 2: The loudness scale would continue to be the same with pistols making less sound than larger calibre weapons."	t5_2ty3s	True

Don't get me wrong everything looked great but the zombie AI seemed slightly off, and rightfully so (since after all, the game is in early alpha).


Anyways, I'm here to report that the game actually played significantly smoother than what i had expected -- not to mention how much more fluid it feels compared to the Arma II mod version. However, in regards of zombie AI, the main difference compared to the mod was indeed their movement. 


The zombies no longer tried to side-strafe their way towards me, they instead ran straight at me and even jumped forward when stopping from a running attack. I did notice that there was a bit of a delay between their attack animation and when I took damage, but I can only assume that it's a timing / syncing issue between the attack animation and the actual damage event.


It almost felt like the damage was triggering as soon as the animation event was being played, making it almost feel like there was some sort of lag between the attack and actual register.


The character movement in the game felt a lot better than the mod's version, being able to run faster (and having zombies seemingly run faster) made the experience just that much more exhilarating. In regards to gunplay, it's exactly like Arma II.


Overall, this short DayZ SA experience has reaffirmed my ""hype"" in the game, and I definitely will be buying it day one on Steam.

EDIT: @ MattLightfoot - Obviously im aware your in contact with dean so no the situation. That been said though, the link above was given by adventure consultants today on there Facebook, if you look at there page, either there top or seconds status, they give that link above when they were asked about the current status on the Everest trip.

I, like most of you, wanted more out of the Six Launcher... so I decided to put my money where my mouth is and started building a better launcher myself. 


It currently does not apply patches for DayZ or Arma2, but I plan to get that done as soon as possible.

I've been working hard for the past week or two to get where I'm at, and have had a lot of great feedback from my friends who are using it exclusively now instead of six.

I figured I'd jump on here and give everyone a little heads up of what's coming **VERY SOON** (I'll probably release the first version within the next few days)

I really want the community to help me drive the direction of the software, so I'm very open to any good feedback you have.

**EDIT:** More discussion going on here http://dayzmod.com/forum/showthread.php?tid=31028

**UPDATE:** I've released the beta to the public for download:

GameHawke	488	127	281	"Reading through the posts that have been made by this community towards rocket and his team has blown me away the last few days. Its seems people have forgotten why rocket was so favored when the mod was released last April, ever since DayZ was available Dean has kept his doors open and has been very vocal on the progress, which as gamers we should still be considering a privilege. There are games in the making right now which wont be out for a year or so that we don't even know about that are frequently being delayed internally due to the same issues DayZ standalone are having right now.

Rocket should not be apologizing for giving his opinions on when standalone could be released, the reason he has felt no problem giving that information is because the community has always previously been understanding that the development process can never be set in stone and that delays/bugs are probable. Now the community seems to sense that rocket owes them something.. He does not owe us anything, He created a successful mod and have let the community take all of the work he has done to mod themselves for our enjoyment and has also decided to make a full on standalone. yes we were expecting it in December, but guess what dean decided to not do a shoddy job, he decided to rip everything apart and make an engine that DayZ deserves (which takes time)... Then its delayed some more.. and more.. Why? because dean simply wants to make a great game, What more could we ask for?

I don't know peeps, I just think all this is crazy.. if you want to play a pre alpha, WarZ was released nice and quick, so fast that the game is still the same game it was when it was released. If that is what you want from dean then keep doing what your doing.

1371712192.0	1gpq3u	Why I personally don't want a skill tree, or any development of skills.	Patastrophic	447	87	233	"I'm not trying to force this down anyone's throat, but I would much prefer if the existing (read, no development of skills) design continued on to standalone.

I really only have a couple of reasons, and here they are.

Having a lack of advantages over a player other than possibly owning a weapon, or some skill, is a terrific equaliser, something DayZ has, that no other MMO I've played has explored. There's a genuine feel that 'Wow, I got a military grade weapon, I am every bit the equal of the 34 day survival guys'.

There's no feeling of 'Man I better level up reloading, or should I work on blood transfusions', etc. There's plenty of games where this is a suitable mechanic, but I don't think it suits DayZ.

That brings me to the second point, which I imagine has been raised, and that's the issue of grinding. We're kidding ourselves if we think a way around can be implemented, and even if it is possible, it would have little benefit, in a game where survival is measured in days, not months.

The average player, who may not be represented on a hardcore devotee area like reddit, will not live long enough to take advantage of the development, and as such, people who are good enough to continue on, will only gain further ways of ruining these people's shit. 

It's lose-lose; either make it slow/hard to notice to avoid grinding, and you take away the equalising factor, making it almost pointless to be a beginner, for the first week of a character's life, or you make it quick, so as to be accessible, and it will be abused.

I also disagree with the idea of 'limits on the amount that can be trained' solution. All that does is essentially introduce a new toy, and then a limit on how it can be used. This will mean that a player's power in the game is a function of how long they have been alive, not how long they have worked on a skill (as much as I dislike grinding), or how skillful they are.

That's my two cents, but this is my first text post on /r/dayz, so maybe I don't know anything.

1358862807.0	171yon	[SA] The key to making zombies a more formidable opponent. 	FinalFlashDX	424	72	228	"At the moment zombies are not much of a threat because their behaviour and speed (but not movement pattern) is too predictable. If zombies had set attributes but in varying levels of intensity they would prove to be more unpredictable and formidable foes.

Games are generally more enjoyable if they have randomly generated content, some of which the mod already has (loot, vehicles etc). These features are what keeps the game fresh. If I knew where to get a DMR every time the game would not be interesting and exciting.

Zombies should have a randomly allocated intensities of particular traits.

**SPEED**

* An incredibly fast zombie that can outrun you.
* A zombie that has the same pace as you. (Simlar to the speed we have now)
* A zombie that is slower than you which you can outrun relatively easily.
* A walking zombie.
* A crawling zombie with perhaps no legs or its guts hanging out its chest.

**VISUAL ACUITY**

* Varying from Excellent to Poor or None Existent.

**AUDITORY ACUITY**

* Varying from Excellent to Poor or None Existent.

**VOCALITY**

(Levels of vocality can be heard from different distances and attract zombies/survivors)

* Varying from Screaming to a Groan or Mute.

So individual zombies could potentially but rarely be; easily to alert; fast; screamers. But also; Blind, deaf, dumb and only able to crawl.

This would make venturing into zombie populated areas more dangerous and unpredictable for those in groups and on their own. This could provide more depth for distractions in group play (player shouts to distract zombies whilst team members loot or escape) forcing people to work together in order to succeed.

**TL;DR** Implementing a system where zombies are randomly allocated varying intensities of; Speed, Visual Acuity, Auditory Acuity and Vocality would make them more unpredictable and formidable foes.

1339824815.0	v4npf	How To Use the Most Important and Under-Utilized Feature of ArmA 2 and DayZ: Direct Communication	dodgepong	407	53	140	"I've seen a lot of posts lately from a number of people talking about how talking over chat is cumbersome, or how they're having trouble using chat, or they can't get Direct Communication to work. Some of you probably don't even know what Direct Communication is at all. That's OK: I'm going to tell you what is it, why you should use it, and how to set it up.

##What is Direct Communication?

Direct communication is one of several channels that players can communicate to others in. You are surely already familiar with the Side channel (blue text) -- in a normal game of ArmA 2, you will have 2 sides facing each other, and the Side channel lets you chat to everyone on your own side. In DayZ, everyone is on the same Side, so it acts like Global chat. The group channel (green text) talks to everyone in your sub-group on your side. Again, everyone is in the same group, so this is global. The actual Global channel (White text) talks to everybody. The vehicle channel (yellow) talks to everyone in your vehicle.

Direct Communication is unique in that it talks to everyone *in proximity* to you. In the latest ArmA 2 beta, everyone in a 40m radius around you can hear you talk and can read your chat on the Direct channel. Furthermore, when you speak, your voice is 3D-positioned, meaning that people can not only hear your voice, but they can hear *where* it is coming from. Your voice gets softer as they get further away from you. And the cherry on top: when you talk in the Direct channel, your character's mouth moves along with what you are saying.

Unfortunately, Direct chat was broken in the latest ArmA 2 stable patch, so people had to get by using Side chat. You've probably heard people try to use VON in Global or Side chat, which broadcasts to the whole server. It is annoying and makes the server lag, so it's frowned upon, making the only way of talking to other arbitrary players in-game global text chat.

Newer ArmA 2 beta patches fixed the Direct comms bug, so if you upgrade to the latest beta and join a beta server, you can talk to people in Direct comms and they can hear you.

##Why does this matter?

The latest DayZ patch, 1.7.1, is almost upon us, and it will *require* you to be updated to the latest beta of ArmA 2. And with that, **all DayZ servers will be disabling all chat channels except for Direct Communication.** So you better get used to it, and get it set up to be ready.

*Side note:* If you don't have a mic, you are doing it wrong. Having a mic is going to become mandatory in this game if you want to survive encounters with other survivors, and mics are [dirt cheap](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16836159008). Please do yourself a favor and get one -- otherwise you'll be relegated to text-only chat, and people will shoot you if you take too long to type ""friendly"" when they talk to you and ask you.

##How to set it up

First, make sure you have the latest ArmA 2 beta installed. You can get it from [here](http://www.arma2.com/beta-patch.php). As of this writing, the latest beta is 93825, but there have been reports of people having problems with this beta so I recommend getting 93701. Beta installation [very easy](http://dayz.sykotix.com/arma-ii-beta-client-install/).

Also, if 1.7.1 hasn't been released yet, download [1.7.0](http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/uar1u/17_limited_release/), which is already out.

Next, go to Options &gt; Controls and scroll down until you see the options for voice channels and Push-To-Talk. Normally, you can rotate your chat channel back and forth by pressing the , and . keys. But since the only channel you need in DayZ is Direct, I don't bother with the rest - it's too clumsy. What you'll probably want to do is remove the keybind for ""Push-To-Talk"" (which will talk over your currently-selected chat channel) and instead bind that key to ""Talk on Direct Communications"".

[Example screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/tGNC3.png)

Next, you'll want to make sure you join a server that is running the ArmA 2 beta. When you browse through the server screen, look at the ""Required"" version and make sure it is version 93030 or newer (this is the version that fixed direct chat). I recommend using servers with the same version of the beta that you have (i.e. 93701).

[Example screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/Phwne.png)

Finally, when you are in-game, you can press your hotkey that you set up earlier to speak in direct chat. When you talk, a microphone icon appears and it says ""Direct communication"" in the bottom left corner. It looks like this:

[Example screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/okcHF.jpg)

Now, you may come across some people in a beta server who don't respond to you when you talk to them in Direct. They can hear you, I assure you -- they just don't know what's going on, or haven't bothered to set up Direct comms like you have.

Personally, I can't wait to be in a server where everyone has Direct VON enabled and working. I might even ditch 3rd-party voice programs, because Direct voice is so much more fun and immersive. Here's an example of a group of people all using Direct VON -- you can see how effective it is. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRpPIyJDSEQ"	t5_2ty3s	True

1340042544.0	v8fkz	DayZ Vets vs Newbs disparity grows as an outcome of the recent patch debacle (and modest proposal)		433	89	269	"So, overall **I have faith that Rocket will right the ship** and we can all go back to complaining about dying to the stuff he can't fix, like doors or stairs.  But it really struck me recently the alignment of the different groups in the DayZ community.  

I first noticed this phenomena when the beta patch disabled gamma controls. A lot of vets seemed to think wandering blind or revealing your presence with flares was a noble nighttime endeavor (the rub being the vets have night vision so they could careless about noob struggles).  The new folks just wanted night be more like a full moon but for some reason that was a bridge too far for some of the louder voices in the vet side of the community.

It again became apparent reading through all the threads over the weekend that vets who hadn't died really had no clue what was happening to new players.  I described a few of my experiences [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/v7zt6/anyone_else_avoiding_playing_until_the_latest/c525cat?context=3) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/v7uij/in_1711_there_is_currently_a_bug_with_food_and/c5256as?context=3) but certainly that isn't an all encompassing view.  

The reality was with the undocumented prone nerf, combined with the zombie attack and sight buffs, it became near impossible for weapon-less, food-less, bandage deficient survivors to make positive progress without resorting to old and new exploitation (well documented on r/dayz).  Generally all parts of the community believe players should not be driven to that type of behavior.  

But again, I believe Rocket will get the balance issues worked out.  And **one of the most common things said to anyone complaining about the situation is that this is an ALPHA and we are TESTERS of a free MOD**.  I get it and in fact I am quite sympathetic to that view.  But that view should cut in both directions.  So here is my **modest proposal to Rocket:**

**Whenever DayZ does testing on any major gameplay feature (e.g., major tweaks to zombie behavior, increasing survivor difficulty when starting) or adds new security features (mass bans of exploiters)... wipe the player database.  Completely.  Make everyone start from Day Zero.**  Vets need to experience what the noobs already know.  Noobs need to see that vets have gone through the same thing and found a way forward.  As a side effect all the hacked weapons get wiped, all the duped items get blown away and it is a clean slate again.  The player alive time count also begins to fairly represent at the macro level how these changes are affecting lifespans.  Anyway, who can complain about wiping of player data?  It is *just* an alpha after all and we are *just* testers.

**TL:DR** - To balance the game from past exploitation and to bring the DayZ vet and newb community into alignment more quickly about game changes, wipe the central server of all player data upon major gameplay and security updates.

Rocket, take your time. You clearly have a strong vision for DayZ SA that you're taking the time to execute with a high degree of quality. I believe in your ability to deliver on that vision. Thank you for the amazing experiences we've all shared in the mod, and for your work on the SA.

"	sparta436	389	55	87	"Everyone hates passing out. Something unfortunate happens, you go unconcious, and you usually get to watch zombies tear you apart. Now whats the fun in that?

My idea: From now on when you pass out, you completely lose vision. Not just of your character, but of everything. The screen is completely black as if your monitor was off. You can still here sounds, but everything is played through a filter, as if you were still hearing sounds but while underwater. Everything is muffled, you can hardly differentiate sounds, you can't see anything, and you know something BAD is happening to you.

What this does: This gives players a real sense of urgency and chaos. They don't know whats going on. Your survivor buddy could be dragging out of harms reach or you could be getting your organs torn into by a zombie. The best part is: You won't know until you wake back up. This makes the player totally freak out, you know, like the kind of feeling you get when you're crawling around on NW airfield and a .50 cal bullet lands inches from your face, except scarier.

I could handle being all stealthy and get by a pack of zombies. Now, they notice me better then I could often notice another player around me. They seem to have sniper eyes and bat ears. It wouldn't be too big of a deal, except for the spawning with no defenses thing. I'm actually torn about how I feel about it.

**edit:** as **s4ntana** pointed out, Zombies are no longer fun to fight like this. I'm enjoying that you can hide from them and they forget about you (and now having to figure out a way out of the building you hid in while 20+ zombies you brought there are still wandering around outside), but zombies should be the consequence of being careless in this world, since really it's the other players who should be the unpredictable wild card.

You used to be able to crouch run through an area and not have to worry that some magic zombie behind a building is going to show up and eat your face. Now, according to the sight/sound meters, it seems anything but full prone makes you very visible, and any slight movement is loud as hell.

My most recent attempt was a failure, not because I wasn't being insanely careful, but because out of nowhere four survivors comically appeared screaming and trailing about 30 zombies. I feel that pre-this update, I could have gone prone in the corner as I did, and no one would have noticed me. Instead the descent of zombies turn on me and eat my legs while I lay there.

Also, I'm glad people agree with this. This is a great game with loads of potential, so it's exciting to see it develop, especially as the community explodes in size. As long as we keep in mind that we shouldn't flat out complain, but encourage discussion, and be patient with this epic mod's early state.

**edit again**: Oh yeah, and maybe they **shouldn't be able to climb ladders** ? This scared the hell out of me when I thought I was safe and had evaded a hoard, only to have them take turns climbing the ladder after me.

**final edit: Hotfix is out, and it looks like these issues have been improved. Now get out there and aim for the head!**

... just don't think you can outsmart them by climbing a ladder..."	t5_2ty3s	True
1372527985.0	1hbiq1	It is critical that there are no third party servers in DayZ SA	hdghsh2462	422	90	126	"In a recent thread on this board a user created a topic quoting Matt Lightfoot stating that ""server hosting will be available day 1 for all"". Another user commented with a quote that ""server files available to all on release"".

Rocket, posting under the name `rocket2guns`, replied with the following,

&gt;Linux server build is very likely. Server footprint is only 1.2gb. Bandwidth is TBA, but we're doing formal systems testing soon to get some metrics.

In doing so he seemingly qualified that servers will be hosted by players and that server files will be ""available to all on release"". His comments on operating system compatibility further suggest that individuals will in fact have access to server files and that DayZ SA will follow in DayZ Mod's footsteps where you can play your character on servers owned by other players. Moderators at DayZMod further qualified these facts in conversation.

I am here to tell you that this is by definition a security hole. Allowing characters from third party servers to join official Bohemia servers (if there are any) is a huge mistake. Team Fortress 2 uses a similar model and that brings comfort to some. What I am here to tell you is the fundamental difference and why Bohemia is the only company in the world to ever attempt using this model and why it is a mistake.

If there are servers and they are allowed to interact with a central server then the communication is either trusted or it is not trusted. If the communication between the two is not trusted then that is a security hole. The communication between a third party server can not be trusted. Valve knew that and that is why loot is not gained based on what a third party server says. In Team Fortress 2 you gain loot by and only by the total amount of time the central server sees you playing the game. It does not allow any third party servers to tell it what to do. Bohemia plans to do the opposite and it is a mistake.

Bohemia is currently planning for the players to shoulder the burden of server hosting. They are also planning for servers hosted by third parties to be a part of the whole that defines where your character can play. That is a huge mistake and there must not be any third party servers.

Based on this information, regardless of any additional information, here are some things that professional programmers / software engineers are capable of doing to their servers without possibility of detection.

- Read the application's memory during run time (cheat)
- Modify the application's memory during run time (cheat)
- Modify incoming packets to their server (cheat &amp; harass other players)
- Block incoming packets to their server (soft ban player's ip address)

Here are some things that professional programmers / software engineers are capable of doing that would be nearly impossible to detect (with the exception of cases with extreme abuse)

- Send fake information to the central server (cheat)
- Make fake requests to the central server for sensitive information"	t5_2ty3s	True

1370640983.0	1fw1h1	Why I would like proper (no HDR trick) night and no NVGs at all in SA. Bit long winded, sorry.	BobPage	399	74	177	"I understand this isn't a popular opinion, I saw a thread recently where someone said a similar thing but didn't really justify it too much and he was down-voted badly.  I anticipate the same but before you dismiss me entirely at least allow me to put forward my case.  Apologies in advance for the length of my post.

I first played DayZ when there were around 10-20 servers in existence for the mod.  I had played Arma 2 previously and was a fan of the game, despite its horribly buggy nature.  DayZ blew me away, I was amazed at how immersive and fresh the experience was.  That was it, for the next 6 months I was hooked on this game, I played hundreds of hours.  It was and still is one of the most unique and outstanding gaming experiences I've ever had.  There are moments I will never forget, like the first time I killed another player, defending myself from two bandits who killed my friend (I managed to kill both).  The fear, my heart beating out of my chest and the absolute relief and satisfaction after several tense minutes moving round Devil's Castle when I finally killed the second guy.

My first night in game I ran around with a friend in mostly darkness, trying to explore Cherno and find weapons etc.  Back then you couldn't just switch servers to find one with daytime, there were only a few servers and all of them were completely full.  You felt relieved just to find a space in a server (spamming return key until someone disconnected was essential unfortunately) and then additional relief when it actually logged you in without freezing.  Flares/chemlights were actually used by players so they could see the world around them properly.  Of course we knew that NVG's were in the game but finding them seemed fairly implausible, there were no loot maps, vague information on spawns and everything was new to almost every player on the server, no one seemed to have them.  Eventually we were picked off by a sniper running around Cherno cluelessly, a hard awakening to the grim realities of Chernarus.  

My second night playing with my friend we began to interact with other players more, we got friendly with some, the first was an American guy who was actually in the US armed forces (I'm from the UK), he had been playing the game longer than us and helped us out with some advice and tips on the game, a nice guy.  We hung round with him and eventually met up with others on the server, always asking if friendly, each encounter was tense and seemed entirely unique.  There were moments that I'll never forget.  Eventually that evening we amassed a group of 8 of us, everyone from a different country.  We then hopped on someones teamspeak server and spent the rest of the night as a group roaming around and exploring what seemed like an endless mysterious landscape.  

We had no NVG's and we did not know the HDR trick, so darkness was proper darkness.  We had to use chemlights and flares to see our environment properly.  There was laughter, there was extreme tension, there was panic.  I remember the experience fondly.  I also remember the darkness and the edge that gave to the entire thing.  There is nothing quite like the panic of running through a town being chased by zombies you can barely see, or encountering a player in almost pitch darkness and having to somehow navigate the experience.

I remember the thrill of having to use a flare and light yourself up at night just to be able to function.  I remember the thrill of seeing flares used by other players and suddenly realising ""oh shit there is another guy just down the road from me"" in pitch darkness.  Cherno used to be covered in flares as you approached it, darkness was exactly that, actual darkness.  I remember running past a guy near the west side of Cherno on the ground next to me and not even seeing him because it was so dark, then suddenly realising something was stopping my run only to look down and see a player with his winchester in my face as mine was in his.  The following conversation was tense but amazingly resulted in neither of us shooting one another.  I can remember so many amazing experiences and many of them tied to the fact that darkness was actual real darkness.

Then I learnt about the HDR trick and darkness became not so dark.  I also learnt about the game pretty quickly and found myself able to tool up with excellent equipment fast.  With the HDR trick NVG's weren't even that essential, but I quickly began securing these and in no time at all I had the ability to completely negate the darkness.  It was a relief, I was pleased, I felt more comfortable now of course.  

For the following months I played the game and enjoyed it a great deal, the players became less friendly, which was an interesting evolution and then the hacking began etc.  Eventually I felt like I'd lost something about the game.  It was part that I was so familiar with it of course, but also that night time wasn't actually night time any more for me, just a green filter on a computer screen.  Zombies were no threat whatsoever, I was in control of my environment, the edge the darkness brought was meaningless, the game may aswell have been constant daylight.  As things progressed eventually it was hard to even find a server that was populated whilst it was dark.  Everyone just went to daylight servers and those who were on night servers were probably kitted out with NVG's anyway.   

You had to use the NVG's or the HDR trick of course, there was no escaping, unless you wanted to place yourself at an enourmous disadvantage to that bandit who was after your beans.  

I realise that so many people who came to play DayZ late probably missed out on those amazing experiences I had early on.  They never got to enjoy what it is like to be on a full server in pitch darkness when no one had NVG's and no one could see in the dark in any way.  People naturally banded together more because zombies were a whole lot more dangerous when it is actually dark.

I've recently come back to the game in anticipation of SA release and I have been playing a lot of the mods that have come out.  Which has been great.  

I know everyone is comfortable with their NVGs now, you want to see at night, I know and I understand that.  I know that everyone is comfortable use the HDR/gamma trick to see at night, yes it is more comfortable and makes the game easier to see at night.  I get it and I at one point early on craved the ability to see at night also.  We all like to be comfortable.  

Looking back though I realise that the darkness added something to the game, it brought a certain edge to the experience that is lacking once you know how to negate darkness.  Less comfortable, less secure, but isn't that part of the fun?   Some players have never even experienced what true server wide darkness is like in DayZ.  Having to use chemlights and flares at night is thrilling and adds a new dimension to the game, the zombies that people have complained about not being a threat actually become a far more serious threat when you can't see 5m in front of you without assistance.  Atmospherically the darkness adds to the experience and on top of that the darkness is another reason for players to not just shoot each other on sight and actually try to team up, because the PvE is far trickier when you can't see shit.

I don't want to be punished for attaining good gear in terms of the game experience.  Attaining NVG's removes an edge to the game, you may say ""well just don't wear them"", but that would just be dumb, because I am giving a huge advantage away to any bandit.  I don't want to have to be dumb to embrace the full experience this game has to offer.  

I am posting here because I want to humbly ask Rocket to seriously consider this as an option before the release of SA.  It would be a bold decision, but I am hopeful that there are other people who understand why I would want this and can see the benefits also.

A bit rambly and long, so sorry about that.  I understand the issue of players just switching to daylight servers because they don't want to take risks.  Perhaps some mechanic that provides superior loot spawns on a night time server could solve this?  An improved chance of finding the best weaponry/gear etc.  More risk = more reward.


Anyway, thanks for reading if you got this far.

1362765100.0	19x8aa	DayZ and morality: what really sets DayZ apart from other games, and a story of an overprotective parent/sniper	Gadsden	373	50	86	"I'm an old gamer. I've played ArmA since it was OFP in 2002, and it's really the only thing I play other than Take On Helicopters (because I've had a helicopter flying fetish since I was 14, playing Gunship on the Amiga).

Now I play ArmA with my son (14), and we've got a lot of DayZ/ArmA laughs and stories, and even some proud moments as a father to see the moral paths my son has chosen to follow in DayZ.

After leaving DayZ for a couple months and only playing Wasteland, I went back to playing DayZ about a week ago. It was only then that I really realized what the real high of DayZ is over other games, at least for me.

As funny as this is going to sound, considering the overwhelming number of ass holes who purposefully hunt new spawns, or just shoot on sight to avoid being shot, it's the social interaction. Maybe even the hope of restoring faith in humanity by the off chance that you'll find someone who won't shoot you in the face for no reason.

When you play games which allow you to pick a team to play with, like Wasteland, you have instant trust in your fellow teammates. You play with 25ish other people on your team and you might have fun playing with certain people, but it's not nearly as bonding as DayZ encounters can be; where people actually have to earn your trust, not just pick opfor/bluefor.

I've made DayZ friends that I would probably trust in real life, not because we exchanged phone numbers or keep in touch, but because I can tell by their gameplay [in DayZ] what their real moral alignment is.

The other day my son's character got killed by an infected swarm making a lucky hit on him while we were being hunted by bandits in Berezino. I actually felt bad/sad for him. I made my way back to his body and retrieved his CZ 550 as he re spawned on the coast.

As I was making my way to him he met up with a couple friendlies and stuck with them until he was gunned down [unarmed] by a bandit. I had that worried dad feeling as I just wanted to be able to protect my son and avenge him, but I was too far away. His new friends killed the bandit, and he respawned again.

This time I met up with him in Balota before he got to his friends in Cherno. He was nearly dead again, so I blood bagged him and sent him on his way to play with his new friends. Apparently I'm an overprotective parent, so I tailed him and escorted him to his friends w/o him knowing I was there.

He met his friends in the apartments and I watched from 500 meters away with my M40.

Trouble found his group of 3 when they were looting the firehouse. A couple of bandits trapped them in the firehouse. I could hear shooting but I didn't have a good shooting solution from my hide. I could have easily picked my son's entire team off in the tower, but could only see the ground level surrounding the firehouse through a section of broken walls near the back door.

I ranged the door to the firehouse using the mildots and a card I made with common measurements of in-game objects. A size card I created by creating a mission where I had a mildot scope and range finder and went around reversing the range finding formula on things like doors, windows, telephone poles, street signs, etc. (I play on a first person server with no range finding, no map waypoints in the hud, and no map player icons).

I doped my scope to 500m, and trained my reticle on the back door of the firehouse [middle of the gap in the broken wall] and waited. As soon as I saw the barrel of the bandit gun break the side of the wall I sent him a present. As luck would have it, the lead-off was perfect for his sprint and I landed a near perfect center mass shot.

It was then that I alluded to my son that I was still in the game, I had been watching over him for the last 30 minutes, and that I just shot one of his bandits.

His friends were alarmed that there were now sniper rounds in addition to the nearby bandits, and he said, ""That's my dad.""

The bandit, not knowing where the shooting was coming from, went around behind the wall I couldn't see, to my side, to bandage himself from my last shot, at which time I relieved him from the responsibility of holding up his cumbersome head.

The bandit's partner decided that 3, plus a sniper in the hills at night, wasn't worth the trouble and either split or logged.

My son and I earned the respect of the people he was playing with and since they protected my son, they had earned mine. Something no other game seems to come close to capturing.

As much as I hate the shoot on sight and bandits, they make the friendly encounters that much more appreciated and meaningful.

*edited to fix some glaring spelling/grammar mistakes. I know there are more but I'm busy at the moment, and I'm not trying to get this published. ;)

It has been away for a while now, but the Admin is bringing it back up tonight for our enjoyment. The server has MANY extra vehicles enabled, even a handful of helicopters for aerial assault missions :):) So if your looking for a new home, hate ghosting, or just looking for a break from your daily life as a bandit or hero, come play with us on DayZ 9999.

The server will be running all the latest revs tonight on startup and should be updated as new revs come. Vehicle and tent saving is fully functional so come on in, stay a while :) we need all types of players to maximize the DayZ experience.

Server Name: DayZ 9999 US

Admin: Tallahasse

IP: 96.52.136.51

Port: 2302

If you come and play, throw us an upvote if you want. It'll only make the server grow faster.

TL;DR Dood come play on DayZ 9999 its awesome...

EDIT: The IP was incorrect before, should be correct now.

NOTICE: so it looks like we have been having some crazy BattlEye issues with the server, a lot of ppl getting kicked randomly.

What i have personally done to combat this is manually reinstall BattlEye from here http://www.battleye.com/download.html to an older version which in turn forced the server to update my BattEye, its been smooth sailing for me since then. may work for some and not for others i dunno, give it a try if you think it will help you

With this came a lot of sumbissions to the subreddit linking to those tweets. Obviously there should be discussion on what he says, but we do not feel that individual posts for each is necessary (and as much as some people may like to see Rockets face, we dont need the frontpage of the subreddit covered in it :P).

So we have decided to make this post, each time there is a new #DayZDaily tweet, there will be a new top level comment created for it, and discussion should be below that comment. **Top level comments which do not link to #DayZDaily tweets, will be removed to prevent clutter**. 

We will see how this goes, and might end up making a new self-post each week if this one becomes cluttered, or leave it untill it does.

Details inside.	kilcunda	358	37	46	"&gt;First of all, obligatory **'This is a self post - Please upvote as I do not recive karma for this post'**. This issue is incredibly difficult to find reliable solutions for, and many players are just told that they have to respawn and lose their character (which - as you will see - isn't always true). The more players able to see this (and find it by searching either Reddit or via search engines) the better. Thank you.

It took me quite a lot of searching, experimenting and combining other unverified methods, but I believe this is the most simple and efficient way to escape the 'Debug Plains' WITH your character and all his/her items, WITHOUT using the 'Keep running in this direction and hope you don't die of thirst/hunger' method. I'll try to keep this short and sweet:

*Note - If you're stuck in the debug forest skip to step #4*

*****

**1. Verify that you're stuck in the plains across multiple servers:**

Logging out of the debug plains immediately and logging in to another server may sometimes fix the problem. If you are permanency stuck in the debug plains, follow the next few steps:

**2. Log out of your current server. Log in to Canada 2:** 

Canada 2 seems to be the only server which worked for me, but other players on the forums have suggested that any server running an older patch version will work (~~**EDIT**: Adamater pointed out that Canada 2 may no longer work for some players, if that's the case try ANZ8 - thanks to [SteelOverseer](http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/w0dnf/probably_a_commonly_asked_question_butwhy_did_i/c595mm3)~~ **EDIT AGAIN**: [Apparently Canada 2 is still working](http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/w0g59/you_can_escape_the_debug_plains_without_losing/c597c9k)). This will transfer you from the debug plains to the *debug forest*, which is much easier to escape from. 

*The moment you log in, run and hide in a safe place amongst trees*; Some players seem to enjoy killing others in debug areas. Additionally, [bonzomadrid2 points out](http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/w0g59/you_can_escape_the_debug_plains_without_losing/c598dak) that connecting to Canada 2 via Six-launcher may prevent this method from working: 

&gt;""If this fix isn't working for you, make sure you're not connecting to Canada 2 via SIX launcher. When you connect via sixlauncher, the launcher will install the proper files. That's why some people are saying it doesn't work.""

**3. Log back in to the server of your choice:** 

Optional, but a good idea. If this method becomes popular, I'd be expecting quite a few players in the debug forest area.

**4. Walk South-East for a minute, enjoy freedom!:** 

&gt;**Can't find South-East?**: If you don't have a compass or GPS, I suggest using the [shadow method](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwrsumX36nM&amp;feature=player_detailpage) during daylight, or the [northern star](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df6-M4iAv_o) (constellation) method at night. (For those in a hurry, log in to a server with the current time somewhere around 8-11 AM. The shadows should be facing west). **EDIT**: [Alililele points out that the clouds in DayZ always travel from west to east.](http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/w0g59/you_can_escape_the_debug_plains_without_losing/c5980r2) This is particularly helpful if you don't have a watch or are otherwise unsure what time the server operates on.

Rather than walking for anywhere between 15 minutes and half an hour, this should take you between 2-5 minutes if you're heading in the right direction. You'll find yourself on the coast a little way west of Kamenka [(Map image here)](http://i.imgur.com/oc7Xo.png). Alternatively, if you follow the clouds east as suggested by Alililele, you'll eventually find yourself near Zelenogorsk. Either way, you've still got your weapons, items, stats and if you're lucky, spawning in the debug forest may have restored your blood, health and/or food.

*****

Hope that helps - Remember, DayZ is still in Alpha, annoyances such as these are to be expected and will be fixed in time. If you have any comments or questions, please let me know in the comments. Likewise, if this method hasn't worked for you or you've found an alternate/easier method please post them and I'll add them to the original post. Good luck and happy bean-hunting!

**EDIT:** I should probably add, this is in no way 'my' method - It's more a collaboration of methods posted here on /r/dayz and DayZ forums. So far, this seems to me to be the safest and time-efficient way to escape the debug plains/debug forest - As I've already said, if you have any suggestions or methods of your own please share them so other players can see.

**EDIT 2:** Cleaned up formatting a bit.

**EDIT 3:** Adamater [posted an alternative solution in the comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/w0g59/you_can_escape_the_debug_plains_without_losing/c596hf9) that may work for some players: 

&gt;*""I got put in the debug plains yesterday, there was a server running 1.7.1.1, I logged into there, I was in the plains but pretty close to the edge of the map now. I log out, when I log back in today I was at cap golova and I still had all my gear. If anyone wants to try it put the host as 1.7.1.1, there is only one with it.""*

**EDIT 4:** Confirmed that Canada 2 is still working. 

**EDIT 5:** Alililele pointed out that [clouds in DayZ always travel West to East](http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/w0g59/you_can_escape_the_debug_plains_without_losing/c5980r2) - Very handy to know if you don't have a watch!

**EDIT 6:** Bonzomadrid2 [pointed out](http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/w0g59/you_can_escape_the_debug_plains_without_losing/c598dak) that connecting to Canada 2 via Six-launcher may prevent this method from working.  Try connecting via the default Combined Operations multiplayer server list if you're having difficulties.

**EDIT 7:** Allyoyens apparently [posted the same method yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/vyhoq/how_to_escape_debug/), and his version is a lot shorter if you want a nice little TL;DR to share with other players rather than this pile of edits and discussion.

**TL;DR - Log in to Canada 2, walk South-East for 2 minutes or East for 5 or so. Log back in to your preferred server. If that doesn't work (or you get lost), read through the detailed instructions.**"	t5_2ty3s	True

I think it would add another interesting layer of game play if say a group of players descended on some small town like Pusta, cleared it of Z's and made it a green zone were people could trade items and get restocked on what the town has to offer. It could be the foundations of true community building in the game.

The catch is that the purges would only last until the server restarted, which they have to to keep up with the beta. As well towns would have a spawn limit instead of what you see is what you get (i.e. Pusta has a spawn limit of 200 Z's. That means players would have to kill 200 Z's before the town is completely clear). This would also help cut into hoarders supplies which in turn would mean that players would be forced to scavenge more instead of relying on their groups' stockpile.

Thoughts?

Edit: Whoa! You guys have put in some great additions to this idea. I especially like the ""Zombies wander back towards town"" idea, fucking gold. I hope Rocket and/or his team glance this if they haven't got something like it in the works already.

1342508656.0	wovpz	Streaming DayZ - Hackers, stream cheaters	NeoDestiny	400	89	213	"About 3-4 weeks ago I started playing/streaming DayZ. My SC2 viewers were incredibly receptive to this (surprising, since they usually don't like me streaming other games) and I seemed to have a lot of fun playing. The game was amazing for a ton of reasons; I don't need to get into this reasons as everyone here already knows, I'm sure.

I've had to do some crazy shit to deal with stream snipers and griefers. Setting up and 8 minute delay (which comes with its entire own set of problems), moving from areas much quicker than I'd like, having to communicate in code or via skype text chat to friends, having an overlay that consumes 20% of the screen, etc...etc...Just a lot of annoying shit. But through all of this, the game's been fun enough to play, regardless of the stupid shit that happens.

Then I made a grave mistake. A mistake that's going to keep me from ever streaming this game again.

I got 5-6 friends, set up my own server (PA 1), and then decided to play DayZ without streaming.

[Holy fucking shit, this game is awesome](http://i.imgur.com/bcfGT.png).

Getting into 2-3 hour wars with other groups of people, constructing vehicles free of harassment, actually sneaking up on people without everyone always knowing you're coming, etc...etc...Basically, playing the game off stream was an entirely different experience.

I like to think I've had an overall positive impact on the community. I've exposed tons of people to the game and the mod (I've had dozens and dozens of people e-mail me/tell me they've purchased Arma 2 because of me) and I've always cast the game in a positive light. I was tired of shitty servers, so I bought a $100/month dedicated box to start hosting some of my own (PA 1 set up at the moment as a trial/test).

I feel like after playing that it's going to be hard to bring myself to ever stream this game again. It just seems so much better off stream, and the hacking/sniping problem seems inevitable. I've perused the dayzmod forums quite a bit but I've never found anything exactly relating to these issues. Are any of the devs planning on adding in support that makes it harder to find people on servers? And what about the hacking problems, are those things that are always going to be a part of DayZ?

It seems kind of sad that a stream that can easily hold 4-5k viewers for this mod (plus videos posted to 60k sub youtube channel) has to just disappear because of snipers + hackers. Any suggestions or ideas from anyone?

Thanks for the great game, and community, and thanks for taking the time to read this. &lt;3"	t5_2ty3s	True

and here are the logs: http://imgur.com/a/lzyu5 

If Frankie wasnt hacking, then let him upload the unedited footage, I'm sure we will see some of these names there.

UPDATE: The user Univerbal summed the whole thread up in a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8pmqaTOc_g), watch it. EDIT: Frankie took it down because of copyright infringement, this guy is a joke... 



The whole text is about this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeCK823BArc (watch it before downvoting) Sorry, for the wall of text, my mobile is messing it up.

Frankie's new video contains a scene where he eliminates a whole squad. Pretty impressing, huh? 
I had the same opinion. The video is awesome, it's fun to watch and you get the impression that FRANKIE plays like a beast. 
I am playing on the same server and I began to wonder as I took a closer look at the video. 
There are two points showing that Frankie is obviously using some kinda hack. 

The debug monitor. I know, there is a debug monitor on Taviana, but it's not the one Frankie has in his video. 
Here's a little comparison of the two debug monitors: 
[This](http://i.imgur.com/ZxKGN.png) is Frankie's debug monitor and [this](http://i.imgur.com/rRI8n.jpg) is the actual debug monitor of the DayZ Taviana Mod. It's easy to see the difference and what's interesting about that, is that the one frankie is using, isnt even included in the dayz_code.pbo, so the only way to get it, is to modify this file. 

If you do this, Battleeye will kick you as soon as you join the server, so in order to get on it, you need to bypass battleye. 

However, this is not why I'm calling Frankie a hacker. It just shows that he uses a battleye bypass, but for what? To get a debug monitor which is only slightly different to the one taviana is already offering you? 

The answer is no, he is using it to turn his godmode on.

5 people shooting at him without him taking a single hit, not impossible, but also not very likely. 
I know a bit about hacks and in DayZ it's pretty easy to spot a godmode. 
The temperature icon is blinking, not like on Namalsk when you're freezing, it just blinks from time to time. Turn the quality of the youtube video to 1080p and watch the temperature icon during the fight (starts around 15:30), it's clearly blinking. 

EDIT: Maybe my conclusion was a bit harsh, I will wait for a potential answer from Frankie regarding my accusation. I am just sad, that my favorite youtuber is obviously hacking, but I am still looking forward to someone proving me wrong. 


UPDATE: Frankie stated his thoughts and the majority of you seem to agree with him. After rereading his text, I cant help myself, but what he wrote is partially bullshit. I really dont want to call him a hacker, but he keeps lying. 

In point (i) he writes

&gt; (i) Blinking Temperature monitor This blinks throughout. The glitchy rain in DayZ is partly the cause, as you can &gt; see it blinks when I am on less than 12,000 health and getting hit by zombies.

This doesnt blink throughout, it just blinks during the squad wipe. Frankie should watch his own video again. 
[Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_xgoNNJ290) (thanks to rawb2k) is a nice video, where the temperature behaves exactly like the one of frankie. Weird, huh? This surely has to do with some odd post-processing, as it is blinking in the exact same intervals like the one of the hacker.

In point (iii) he's writing that he updated his DayZ version from 1.7.3 to 1.7.4.4 and this fucked up his debug monitor.
Seems pretty logic, but sadly DayZTaviana is running an own version of DayZ, so it doesnt affect Taviana, when you update your vanilla DayZ. So this explanation is just wrong, it doesnt explain his different debug monitor. 

However, maybe everyone had this debug monitor due to some kinda glitch? 

Answer is no, [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIKQ5ktjpt8) is a video, where Frankie shot the guy at the airport, I dont care if he dubbed it later on or not, it's just the fact that the player ""Schweinewurst"" has a different debug monitor than Frankie, so it isnt a serverside bug. 

But why would Frankie ask Jack, if his debug monitor did also change? 
Let me ask you, why isnt Jack answering? Did Frankie edit this part of the video and dubbed it while editing? I dont know for sure, but I think Frankie is a pretty clever guy and knows how his fans would react to this and no one would be dumb enough to point this out, when it could be the evidence that he uses a hack.
However, this last part isnt any kinda proof, it's just odd.


Frankie is a charming guy and pretty likable, so I can understand, that many of you just dont want to believe, that he is lying, but some of you should really open their eyes and look at the evidence before calling me a jealous kid. 

UPDATE 2: So far we have some wrong explanations from Frankie, a whole bunch of guys defending him without having any kinda valid argument and a lot of people adding evidence to the case. 
Please frankiefanboys, give me some proof, PLEASE prove me wrong, explain the debug monitor and the temperature icon, because these are serious indications for a hacker. 

And NO, frankies explanations are wrong, dont believe him, there are a lot of people here proving him wrong, so stop relying on his statement."	t5_2ty3s	True

RyanMill344	375	75	229	"So I spawn in, can't really remember where, but I consult my map (Online map) and decide that as a fresh spawn, I've got nothing to loose by going to Cherno. I head to the grocery store and some food, a M1911 with 2 magazines, and a bandage. I decide to do something a little stupid, and I head to the apartments (I think they are apartments). I find a Lee Enfield with a few mags. Just as I exit, I hear a voice on the comms. ""Friendly! Friendly!"" he calls, and I turn around to see him. He's  bleeding from his ass, and is unarmed. I take to the mic and ask ""Were you shot? How much blood do you have?"". He responds ""Yeah, I think he was in the field! I got like 7k, do you got any bandages?"" (Keep in mind, his mic quality was shit so this is not word for word). I tell him to get inside and I'll bandage him. So we go in, and I patch him up, and offer to help him find a gun. We do a little more searching around, and eventually find him a Lee. I bid him goodbye and tell him that I'm heading to the NW Airfield (cause I'm crazy like that) and he looks me in the eye, says ""Thanks, but no you're not."" and shoots me in the head. Just like that. Boom. Dead. I save this guy's life, find him a weapon, and he shoots me in the fucking head? I suppose I should have expected it. Anyway, a few failed lives later, I manage to get back to Cherno and secure an AKM from the military/medical tents. From there, I go hunting. Hunting for the son of a bitch who shot me. I find him near a fire in some fucking forest. I lye down, take aim, and fire. *Bang* *Bang* Bang*. Three shots, one of which misses, and I manage to break his leg. He starts yelling ""Friendly! Don't shoot!"" (At this point he still doesn't know where I am). I begin talking. ""Hey, asshole, remember me? I'm the guy who saved your fucking life. The guy you shot in the face?"" and fire two more shots beside him, deliberately missing. ""Now, you're gonna drop your fucking gun, and crawl away from it, you understand?"". He replies ""Yeah, yeah! Okay!"" and drops the Lee Enfield I got him. He crawls about twenty feet away from it, and I approach him. ""Please man, don't kill me! I'm sorry!"" he pleads. ""Too bad"". One shot, straight in the forehead.

So I don't have the best grammar and spelling, and I'm shit at writing,  but don't tear me up too bad, please? This is one of my first Reddit posts, and I'm still not quite sure what the standards are. But anyway, that story is the reason why I don't trust anyone. I will shoot on sight, and I will shoot to kill. No matter if you are unarmed or bleeding, I will fire. Or hack. Or bludgeon. By whatever means, one of us will die."	t5_2ty3s	True

For some of you this seems really obvious but after browsing the last couple days as we get closer to release its obvious to me that not everyone understands what that means. 

For the purpose of clarifying. 
Most games go through alpha then into beta to then a stable release (games like call of duty) Standalone will follow the minecraft format and go from alpha to beta and will probably stay in alpha as it will be constantly updated with new features. 

 I must reiterate, Dayz Standalone will be ALPHA on release. This means we can expect bugs to happen. We may not have many assets to play with (weapons, loot and such). Not all the features we've been hearing about will be there yet but will be coming in updates. 

If anyone feels I missed anything or if they have any corrections I should make feel free to let me know.

TL;DR Standalone will be Buggy and may not have all the assets in place. Don't flip out over it. "	t5_2ty3s	True

I have recently moved back in with him while studying at University and he has complained that games just can't hold his attention anymore.


About a week ago I decided to bite the bullet and purchase ARMA and play DayZ after seeing a fair bit of stuff popping up about it. For the first couple of days he would occasionally look over and watch me playing, commenting about how the game looked interesting and kind of fun. I finally convinced him to buy it too.


He has caught on quick and has actually saved me a few times from some hairy situations. Now each night we log on and just roam around together; finding vehicles, collecting morphine to fix each others broken legs. Finally we have found a game that both of us enjoy.

EDIT: You bastards upvoted. Thank you for the help, it's much appreciated. This is my first build in years, so I appreciate the people that were patient and explained why the i5 3570k would be better for my money.

Also, a couple people seem to have the same setup as me, and are running the game very well.

**Rocket's Note**

&gt;This is the first community + development team generated update for the DayZ mod. It is the culmination of a huge amount of work by both the community and the development team. The half-done 1.7.3 patch was made available to the community, who included many of their own fixes and updates. While dogs are ""in"" there are some mechanics missing so they cannot currently be used. Both myself and Matt spent a significant amount of time playing this today, and it was *a lot* of fun.

*A call of action.*

Blood literally means life in game, and in real life, blood is not much different. 


So what I am asking is for this awesome community to **bring out the Hero inside of us, and give blood to your local blood bank on the week of September 1st through 7th.**

**How?**

Find your local blood drives through [here](http://www.redcrossblood.org/our-regions)

Go to the local blood drives on the week of **September 1st through the 7th.**

Reply with either a pic of your donation, or a post showing the Hero inside us all.

**What are the restrictions?**

Well first off, you can not be bitten by a zombie for obvious reasons. :P

And you can look up the rest of the official policies for donors [here](http://www.redcrossblood.org/donating-blood/eligibility-requirements/eligibility-criteria-topic), and if you can not donate for any reason, try and get someone to do it in your place.


**What made you decide to think of this?** 

When I was shopping for school supplies, I passed by a local blood drive they were hosting that day, and I have never given blood before, but after months of playing Dayz I knew that someone in real life needed a Hero, to give them a blood pack.

So for the first time ever I donated blood, and while I was donating, I thought about what a difference we as a community can make, if we all gave blood, and what it would mean for the thousands of people out there that badly need it. 



**So whether it's saving a Bambi in Cherno or your neighbor, lets bring out the Heros of this gaming community and make a difference.**

ScienceAndWeed	329	50	241	"I am going to go against the grain and say that starting survivors with no weapons was a great addition. I won't say its not frustrating, but frustration is sort of the norm with this game. What I do love about it is that it actually causes and encourages immergent teamwork/cooperation. Before when everyone spawned with a gun you could trust no one, anyone could kill you at any time. I cannot keep track of how many times I have spawned, found another survivor with nothing on him, and communicated to him in DC and worked together. Because we both have nothing, we both had nothing to lose, so we actually were able to form a bond. 

I have worked together with so many strangers, and that simply never happened before whenever everyone spawned with makarovs. I have formed some serious friendships, and I can actually trust people. The key is to only find someone who has voice com and talks on DC, I don't trust those silent types. I had this one guy who me and him palled around for ~8 hours, looting things, finding weapons. Eventually we both had some serious firepower, and yet we still trusted each other at a staggering level, all because of the bond we formed when we had nothing. I even once snuck up on a guy, told him in DC to lower his weapon, and when he responded, I instantly recognized his voice, knew him to be someone I had worked with earlier when I spawned in kamenka, and we ended up palling around for like 4 hours, shooting shit, and telling jokes.

I love the fact that you spawn with nothing!"	t5_2ty3s	True

Rocket doesn't even need to add much more to the game for this to happen, just some extra clothing which could be donned as a ""uniform"". 

I think it would be interesting to see cities where supplies were offered or friendly traded as opposed to a barbaric raiding system. But outside the cities where the CPD [Chernarus Police Dept] has no influence or jurisdiction, you're on your own, much like the game is today.

This could prompt people to either congregate towards larger cities for protection or to band together as bandits in the woods, outcast from society for their ways.

Bandit groups could even take it as far as to impersonate enforcers or to mount full scale invasions on police controlled cities in order to grab the loot and kill and pillage as they are fond of doing.

Personally, I think the formation of such groups would add another very interesting dynamic to the game.

What do you guys think?

EDIT: so general consensus seems to be that it is an intriguing idea but currently implausible at the status of the game today... Disheartening but not unexpected.

* Assured the members of the Wichita Falls Boy Scout Troop 31 that he would attend their ""Halloween Bash"" in character as a literal Kiwi. He did not attend.

*  Installed McAfee antivirus and Norton antivirus software on Bohemia Interactive Software computers. When questioned, Mr. Dean ""Bean"" Hall claimed it was to ""protect against priaprism."" When further questioned if he meant the PRISM program, his response was ""that too.""

* Switched out all the Motion Capture suit footwear with bowling shoes. Resulted in signifant setbacks to development.

* Claimed he would arrive at work ""between 2 seconds and 2 weeks."" Arrived 2 years later. When questioned he replied ""that was a personal estimate."" When pressed further he claimed ""I plead the fist."" 

* Assured Matthew Lightfoot that he would pick up a new keyboard for him on his way home from work. Climbed Mt. Everest instead. When asked about this he responded ""I got lost.""

*  Claimed to be heavily involved in community outreach on Reddit.com. Was caught later that day browsing 4chans /x/, /fit/, /v/ and /b/ boards. When confronted, he quickly closed the window and tabbed over to Visual C, where he had only the lines ""Hello, Bitch"" repeating on screen in an infinite loop. Then angrily responded ""Go away! I'm working!""

* Replaced all coworkers family photographs with a picture of himself on top of Mt. Everest. When pressed, his only comment was ""I operate on another level.""

Any further reports of misbehavior on Mr. Dean ""Bean"" Hall's part should be reported in this thread for consolidation. Thank you.

In the past, I have administrated at a couple communities but I am no longer active in DayZ administration. I just wanted to make that clear right now.

Onto the rant.

The guy behind DayZ Origins is a control freak. I've heard reports from multiple server admins of multiple communities now, and they all correlate together. He forces server admins to use **his** inferior servers, instead of allowing them to use their own servers. He effectively has his mod locked down and will also take money for it (and server rental fees).

He is effectively making money off of a mod of a mod of a game. This is ridiculous. You want your mod out there, you make something badass, thats great dude. But why the hell do you lock down the software, and force admins to use your **inferior** and **much slower** servers? What the hell is wrong with you?

I hear EA Games is hiring, you should send them a resume. I'm sure they would be very impressed with how you have kept your mod under such tight wraps.

Seriously, quit being an elitist [censored] in the lamest definition of the word and stop locking down your mod.

I love Origins, the only thing crappy about it is being forced to play on slow, and probably oversold servers. Let admins have that control back, instead of forcing them to use your servers so **you** can make a small **profit**. Put up a donation page with some google adsense in the background, now you're making a little bit of money without pissing anyone off.

Seriously, quit trying to be the EA Games of DayZ. Nobody is impressed with your actions of locking down the server code and maintaining full control over it **and** charging rental fees (forced) for running community servers on your own hardware, which is more often inferior compared to what each community can actually use. Your bullshit needs to stop. You should know better than to think you could do this sort of thing to a community like the DayZ community.

**UPDATE**: Wow! I didn't expect this thread to get this kind of attention! Now I feel a little silly with my corny EA jokes. Anyway, the overall goal here was to attempt to start to get the player base informed of whats really going on with Origins. I'd like to share a few key things that have come out of this post with you now.

 - Ever tried playing Origins from Australia? The single 'authorized' provider cannot host down under, so all of our outback friends are not playing Origins, and if they are they have 500 ping.

 - TopHatLarry posted a pastebin conversation that happened with the creator and those involved with Origins. Its a very enlightening read, his post can he found here: [TopHatLarry's Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/1e9uc0/dayz_origins_creator_who_the_hell_do_you_think/c9y7kxg)

 - Admin Peep from BMRF.me came here and shared his experiences with the guys behind Origins. His comment is the most upvoted post of this thread. Here is a direct link to it though, well worth the read: [Peeps post](http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/1e9uc0/dayz_origins_creator_who_the_hell_do_you_think/c9y97xv)

 - The creators of Origins are making a profit off of it by locking its hosting down to a single, sponsored provider. They do **not** have a license with BIS allowing them to profit off of Origins (which by the way, is a mod of a mod of a game, with an estimated 90% of its code being non-original, community created)."	t5_2ty3s	True

On the DE4 Dayz server hosted by OCUK and Murder Inc Clan the following happened:

My friend Brogotten found a camp of 5+ vehicles and killed a guy called Yldee (I believe he is in the clan that runs the server), then just scouted around and all of a sudden the server crashed with a session lost error message ( note session lost means someone manually crashed the server, if it was a real crash it would say connection lost with server and it would count down ).

 Excited as we are we spammed refresh on the server list to get in DE4 again ( note this was our favorite server where we played on all the time ). When the server popped up on the list again it was locked and only 5 people were in. This included Yldee, we already had some suspicion because since we played on the server for quite a while and we noticed that every time a helicopter crashed the server would shut down shortly after.

Then the server would be locked after the restart presumably for the admins and their clan to go retrieve the helicopter again from the spawn point, take it to a location of their choosing and unlock it again.

 When the server unlocked 5 min after it was restarted (We are on our way to Brogotten at this point) Brogotten got killed by Ydlee and some other guys that all off a sudden appeared around the camp. while pre-server crash these guys weren't anywhere near. (They must of thought Brogotten stole a helicopter or car which is why they crashed the server)

Then when we confronted Yldee with the weird timing on the server crash we got responses like: ""mad ?"". Which in my opinion only confirmed our thoughts that On DE4 Dayz server the admins use the server reset, roll back and lock function to their advantage to have a camp with everything they want without losing them or risking anything.

This is the same if not worse than cheating in this game and something must be done to stop abusive admins like this, it doesn't necessarily affect us much since we only had one car to our name on the server. But things like this cannot continue to happen if the mod wants to grow, I know rocket has said multiple times he doesn't want people banned or kicked from servers to benefit the admins, surely this is the same type of thing?

Thanks and if you have any advice on how to properly report it let me know.

TLDR:
Admins on DE4 Restarted the server after dying to make sure they kept their vehicles and loot. They also constantly restart it to keep helicopters. That's bullshit.

EDIT:
Mostly the situation is resolved now, the head admin MarKer has removed everyone's admin except his and apologized greatly. He also told us he had no idea of these people admin abusing in this way and it won't happen again on DE4."	t5_2ty3s	True

I just finished updating the [weapon comparison chart](http://dayzdb.com/database/weapon-comparison) at DayZDB, but here's a quick list of what changed.

* **Makarov**: 889 damage, down from 2000
* **G17, M9, M9 SD, PDW, MP5A5, MP5SD6, Bizon PP-19 SD**: 889 damage, down from 1389
* **Revolver, M1911**: 1389 damage, down from 4500
* **M1014, Remington 870, Double-barreled**: slugs do 4500 damage, down from 6722
* **Lee Enfield**: 6722 damage, down from 12500 (audible range 162m, down from 234m)
* **AK-74, AKS-74U, AKS-74 Kobra**: 2722 damage, down from 3555

1342721282.0	wtu2p	DAE Think that Fishing would be a cool addition to DayZ?	crashtheface	349	79	129	"I would love to be able to fish in this game, and then cook my catch over my fire.  Since day one I have always thought it would be great to be able to find a Fishing Pole, and use it in small ponds, on the coast, and even be able to cast a line off your boat.

It would be a mechanic similar to hunting goats, cows, etc.  But instead of randomly coming across the fish you would have to wait for a bite, and then reel your fish.  I was thinking the system could be based on a percentage of chance for something biting your hook.

There could also be locations, in the sea, or in ponds, lakes that have a higher yield percentage than other locations ""fishing hotspots""

I was also thinking perhaps you would need 1-2 maybe even three pieces of equipment to fish.  You would need to find a pole, a line, and some tackle.  Or maybe just a pole and some tackle. Tackle would be reusable, once you have tackle you keep your tackle, using it over and over again.  

I think fishing would make a nice addition, perhaps a way to relieve a bit of the stress after a fire fight, or after being chased by zombies.

IDK just a thought I'm sure it's not as viable as it seems but I think it would be cool to cast a line and wait for something to bite, then run off into the woods and cook your fresh catch.

Altair3go	332	67	47	"A little while ago my friend and I were driving from Gvozdno to factory, he had just picked me up on an ATV because I wrecked my Volga by clipping an open humvee door with my side mirror. I got on the back and informed my driver I was going to get myself a drink since it was going to be a fairly long drive. I went to my kitchen, grabbed a Sam Adams Octoberfest out of my fridge, poured that motherfucker into a beer glass like any real man would, and returned to my post. I was absent for all of 2 minutes. As I return to my monitor I notice several things:

1. My friend (the driver of the ATV) is either laughing or crying

2. I am unconscious.

3. I am at 45.83 units of blood.

As I don my microphone all I can muster is a weak and confused ""Wut?""

In short gasps in what I now recognize is hysterical laughter, my friend explains the events I have missed:

""Went around Dubrovka"" 

*gasps for air*

""Wanted to avoid roadblocks""

*breaks into more laughter*

""Chicken...""

*Laughs hysterically for about 15 seconds*

""Chicken... sprinted under tire...""

*starting to calm down at this point*

""We flew 10 meters into the air while doing 60kmh!""

*Breaks into laughter again and becomes incomprehensible*

I regain consciousness at this point, an get a full picture of the events. The burnt out wreckage of the ATV is stuck in the side of a house, surrounded by dead Zed's a line of the corpses trailing in our direction, and then there's the chicken. The chicken is standing ~40m from the crash, staring at us like he owns the place. After he catapulted us, my friend bailed off our vehicle before it exploded, and dragged my unresponsive ass off the ATV and out of the village, and patched me up, all while fending off half the zeds in Dubrovka.
I look back at the chicken, still staring at us like we owe him an apology.

""This bastard is going down, Jonny"" I say.

I unsling the AS50 from my back, damn the consequences. As I am about to squeeze the trigger, a mythbuster slowly shambles out from behind the nearest building.

BANG.

As our fowl foe falls over dead, the mythbuster looks at me, turns around and shambles back the other way.

No chicken has escaped our wrath since that day.

1344037563.0	xnaok	Important: Server Owners Need To Read This	Zhoir	299	34	60	"A lot of the reddit servers on the sidebar and the majority of servers in general have been comprimised by 4chan.

IF you still have your cfgdayz and battleye folders in your root directory where you launch your DAYZ Server from then they can run a script and find out what your rcon password is to access your server remotly or in-game.

This allows them to ban anyone, kick anyone, spam global admin messages and remove any bans you have set in place.

I have seen quite a few servers on the sidebar in a post on 4chan recently (not going to name them but I will notify everyone I can via PM on here)

**To fix this** (so far it has worked for us) 

- you need to move your cfgdayz folder and battleye folders outside of your root server directory.

- Then edit your start_dayz.bat file to point to the new directorys location of where you have moved the folders to.

Example:
""C:\Users\Administrator\dir\Arma 2\Expansion\beta\arma2oaserver.exe"" -port=2302 -mod=EXPANSION\beta;EXPANSION\beta\Expansion;EXPANSION;ca;@dayz;@hive **-name=cfgdayz -config=C:\Users\Administrator\dir\cfgdayz\server.cfg -cfg=C:\Users\Administrator\dir\cfgdayz\arma2.cfg -profiles=C:\Users\Administrator\dir\cfgdayz-bepath=C:\Users\Administrator\dir\BattlEye** -world=Chernarus -cpuCount=3 -exThreads=3

The stuff i've highlighted in bold is what I have changed. As you can see I pointed it towards where I moved the cfgdayz folder and battleye folder. For security reasons I replaced the directory I used with ""dir."" Simply change dir to the directory you move the folders to.

None of this will be in the standalone, it's just the product of me being bored and wanting to ""design stuff"", so why not DayZ?

**Inventory UI** concepts which got a lot of criticism from the community for looking too messy, but ignoring my design, I still would really love to see this kind of inventory management used for DayZ:SA.

I've found that I can add buildings to the map, that are permanent, which people can use to set up bases.

The requirements, you need to find a tank trap and place it somewhere flat and without trees as they will not disappear. Within 24 hours the tank trap will be turned into a building (it is not automatic I do this manually so don't get any ideas lol)

I'm prepared to be flamed for this idea but honestly its something rocket is going to try and do, and also while wandering in the woods how awesome will it be to discover other peoples REAL bases? If anything they might be more obvious but more easily defended?

Any questions and other ideas can also be left in this thread! Thanks

If you come and play, throw us an upvote if you want. It'll only make the server grow faster.

UPDATE THE EXPERIMENT SO FAR!!

So far I have created 3 buildings that will not be found on any other dayz map!

The players have started to fortify them, using what they can to make it harder for enemies to get in.

2 Of the bases were picked out not to be found while 1 group wants their base to be found and are calling themselves neutral.
------------------------------------------------------

UPDATE 2 THE EXPERIMENT CONTINUES

http://aitloian.imgur.com/all/


here is the pictures of what has been created so far, one of bases is not a structure but just a bunch of hardwork with sandbags and wire fences!

HERE IS HOW TO CONNECT IF YOU ARE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH DAYZCOMMANDER
-------------------------------------------

1.Go into Operation Arrowhead Folder/Expansion/Beta

2.DRAG the Beta LAUNCHER into your main folder

3.Right click on the launcher and hit properties

4.In the TARGET line enter -mod=@DayZ and -nosplash (no startup video)

5.Make sure you have a space between the (-) and the """"""""

6.Use the multiplayer section, and search for Dayz 9999

Have Fun!


NOTE: You can still use DAYZ commander after applying the patch, it will just tell you that your outdated but it is wrong just join the server!

Big thanks to SAKUJ0, for helping identify what buildings will work/won't work.



NEW INFO NEW INFO NEW INFO NEW INFO
----------------------------------------------

I have fixed my picture album (my bad created it just for this) so now you can see most of the bases!

We have started building a new city almsot near the centre of the map and we have started calling it NEW CHERNO.

One group has aquired a large amount of guns at their base and are now trading weapons for other items they need!









I'm not even sure if anyone is following this but another update
------------------------------------------------

Due to the overwhelming success of this experiment, I am going to design my own chernarus that will have many new features extra airbases and lots of places for players to take over as a camp. I am going to turn off the server till it is done due to the fact that it is hard to admin, create bases, stop hackers, have a job AND try and make this new map."	t5_2ty3s	True

1340588368.0	vjsxu	To the player who shot me and my friend in Cherno... 	so_this_is_me	337	79	101	"I hope I didn't scare you too much from playing the game. Seriously.

I know you were just trying to be a 'bad ass' bandit when you leant over the roof and shot me in the back as I and my friend bumbled about below. We were messing around, giddy as school girls with enfields. We were hoping to be friendly to anyone we met, see if we could go for some adventures after I had lost my 36 day character to a horrific bug based accident. We could have been friends.

After that first shot my friend figured out where you were hiding and little did you know that as you logged out and back he had lined his sights on your face. You didn't go down without a fight however and lag meant that you killed each other, falling into one another's arms atop the ladder in a lasting embrace. 

By this time I had respawned several times to get back to cherno. I ran as fast as my little legs could carry me past zombies and loot piles alike. I climbed the stairs my breath heavy with the strain and managed to find the 2 of your bodies. I looted quickly, like a ninja, I was in and out of your heavy backpack and gear in a matter of seconds and was so happy to suddenly be able to survive once again. 

And then I heard it. 

The scrape of a foot as it slowly brushed against a step. 

I had seen you rapidly respawning, I knew you were trying to get back to a certain location, back to a certain area, back to a certain roof. I quickly hid the 2 bodies. No point in letting you get any of the spoils of your foul deed. No I had far worse in store for you. 

As I climbed down the ladder to the top of a set of stairs I turned and saw you just rounding the last flight. You paused and looked me in the eye as your 2 empty hands flapped helplessly in front of you. 

I took one step towards you and whispered across the mic ""You got a real purdy mouth, don't ya"". And with that you began descending rapidly.

I gave chase and fired one shot which winged off the stairs. I came to the bottom to see you go into full sprint and disappear around the corner. I followed but managed to lose sight of you briefly. Knowing you'd be a cunning bastard I rounded the small building in the other direction hoping to find you coming around the other way and that you were doubling back. Running right at me your little face filled with terror as you saw me iron site and fire one shot, right into your crotch. 

You turned slightly towards a gap in the wall and I heard a sickening crunch and scream as my bullet did it's work. I quickly ran over to where you had fallen. What happened next was possibly the funniest moment I've ever had in a game and may well have scarred you slightly. 

I had the bright idea to grab your body.

You were clearly here to cause trouble, DMR mags and all sorts had filled your bag as well as supplies to last a single person a lifetime. With that I grabbed you and began to slowly drag you around the streets. I slowly began whispering in your ear about what I was going to do with your sweet supple body. Dragging and dragging, you flailed helplessly blood pouring out. I'm not sure how much you heard as we slowly moved around but I knew you heard some of it. Your eyes lolling around at the buildings as they moved past.

Further and further we went until finally I dropped you in the road and paused. I whispered once more in your ear that I loved you and shot you in the head.

So yeah. That was pretty funny. Hope you're OK now, you seemed to leave rather quickly after I was done. "	t5_2ty3s	True

There will be base construction, new buildings, new vehicles, new skins and IT WILL BE HARDER, we will MAKE YOU FEAR ZOMBIES plus a whole lot more to come. We are basing the first one off of Chernarus as we work on a custom map for it. (think islands ).

Can't thank Stapo enough for the work and time he is putting in with me to work on this.

* 1. Dogs are in it (this isn't news per se*, but I can confirm it now 100%)
* 2. They will be controlled by the player by whistling. Slow down, wait, call back, etc. will all be controlled by different whistles.
* 3. You will have to feed it (raw steaks) and water (water bottle).
* 4. It looks like they can track (not sure if this is finished or if they can just track animals or other players) and warn (they watch out for *danger*, not sure if it's only zombies or other players) and then bark/growl.
* 5. Stealth has been modified (haven't compared it to a older version but from playing I'm positive it's made easier to stealth past zombies).
* 6. How the gear is synced has been modified (probably the ammo count fix).
* 7. maxLocalZombies was changed from 30 to 40, more zombie spawns?

That is what I've found so far, I'm still looking for the exact formula regarding humanity - at what point does one become a bandit or a hero, etc.

I think I found where the skin changes regarding the humanity:
&gt;		_model = ""Survivor2_DZ"";
&gt;		if (_humanity &lt; -2000) then {
&gt;			_model = ""Bandit1_DZ"";
&gt;		};
&gt;		if (_humanity &gt; 5000) then {
&gt;			_model = ""Survivor3_DZ"";
&gt;		};

Here is how the dogs will work: http://i.imgur.com/bLN7z.jpg

This made LOL, dog_ qq _#.wss (#=1,2,3) is played when the dog whines :P

Edit: 5. might have something to do with dogs, they can slow down and it's called stealth. About the stealth past zombies, I found them easier in the current patch but I'm not sure where to look within the files to confirm that.

1346200999.0	yzr9i	"A Slightly More Advanced DayZ Guide
"	funktion	281	38	75	"i originally wrote most of this as a comment, but i've added some additional things for players who are past the ""oh god where did i spawn how do i shot web"" phase of DayZ. 

**Survival Tips:**

stay low, move slow, and abuse freelook as much as possible. don't silhouette yourself against the sky (this means no tops of buildings, tops of mountains, or crests of hills).

here are some things that will make you easily noticable when you're moving around Chernarus:

* Shape
* Shine
* Shadow 
* Sound
* Movement
* Colour

a couple of those you can only really take care of with camo clothing or a ghillie suit, and one of them is dependent on the other player's settings (Shadow). focus on what you can control - shape, sound, and movement. 

* crouch or go prone to take care of shape. i only press C to stand if i know i'm going to have to full-out sprint.

* shine is one of the lesser concerns, but it can give you away. i dislike the revolver for this reason, as even at night it's pretty visible because if the nice silvery finish. i also use characters with a darker skin tone and camo paint, and avoid putting sunglasses on them. you can edit your config file to get camo paint on your survivor, you'll just have to find the code for the face type you want from [here](http://community.bistudio.com/wiki/ArmA_2:_CfgIdentities#List) and append _camo# to it. # goes from 1 to 6, generally. 

* sound discipline is of paramount importance. the sounds of different guns in the game are very recognizable, and they carry very far. depending on your audio setup at home you can easily hear pistol fire from around 500-700 meters away. when in doubt, hold fire and walk. break up your steps as much as possible so you don't have the constant crunch crunch tap sound of your boots. if you're got buttloads of patience and time, press forward and as soon as the animation for a step is half-done, let go. you'll have moved a little bit and made no sound. repeat until you're where you need to go. this also works for crouch and prone positions, but it's slow as molasses. useful if you're sneaking up on snipers on dobry!

* lastly is movement. this is actually a lot harder to control if you don't have 3rd person view on in the servers you're playing in. i've spotted guys in ghillie suits hiding in pine trees by the way they waggle their guns and their legs around while looking for people to snipe. if you're prone, use freelook, even while aiming down sights! the majority of your body mass won't move, and you won't have your lee-enfield or whatever waving like a flag for bandits to lock their crosshairs on to. when in doubt go prone and press shift to slow-crawl to heavy cover. 

**Raiding Tips:** 

* always check behind you. i can't tell you the number of people i've stalked from just 100-150m behind, all because they didn't bother to check their six. some of them have even led me all the way to their bases, which was lucky for me and very unlucky for them. 

* always have an exit strategy. as much as possible never get into a situation where the only way out is to fight. if you have to engage, make sure you have either superior firepower, overwhelming numbers, or an easy escape. there are some desperate maneuvers that you can pull in a bad spot, but don't count on them working all the time. i personally like the ninja vanish, where i throw a smoke grenade at my own feet and sprint the hell out of there. 

* always assume that someone is watching. enough said. i forget about this sometime as well, and it's almost always gotten me killed. 

* always scope out a place before looting it. make sure a location is 100% clear before you go in. are there zeds? did you spawn them? have you heard gunfire within the last 10 minutes? don't go in there if you don't know the answer to those questions. otherwise shit will go down something like this: hey look, a barracks! i'll just run in and get some guns. nope, says the guy hiding inside with an m4 cco. he followed the rules, you didn't. you die. 

**Gearing Tips:** 

* nobody ever, ever, EVER checks Tulga for the skoda that spawns there. it's reasonably close to a bunch of low and medium value industrials at kamyshovo. if you spawn anywhere on the south-eastern coast (drakon, otmel, krutoy cap, etc) it's a good place to check straight off the bat. i've found 3 skodas there within a week of playing/dying/regearing. 

* common locations for camps: [Black Forest](http://dayzdb.com/map#5.092.077), the forests south-west of [Berezino](http://dayzdb.com/map#5.115.068), the forests between [Blunt rocks and Rify](http://dayzdb.com/map#5.136.037), The north/north-west areas of [Ostry,](http://dayzdb.com/map#5.107.021) forests south-west of [Lopatino](http://dayzdb.com/map#4.018.063), forests far north of [Olsha](http://dayzdb.com/map#5.133.021). you'll want to look for areas with dense concentrations of pine trees. smart players will hide tents and vehicles within the trees themselves, ideally hidden from almost all directions. once again, ABUSE FREELOOK! 

* [heli crashes](http://southcoastbeanwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Crashed-Heli-Map-v7.jpg) are only spawned upon server restart - check this [arma2 server list](http://arma2.swec.se/server/list) to see if the server you're on has been restarted recently. within the first 30 minutes to an hour is the best time to go looking for them. if you already have a vehicle with decent offroad capabilities, you can cover pretty much the entire map in that first hour. there are 2-5 heli crash spawns on the map, if you've found 2 already then you should be pretty much set. take note of how often that server restarts and make sure to do it again on the next restart. [here](http://i.imgur.com/t1Eeu.jpg) is the route i generally take, assuming i've gassed up in krasnost. the map isn't 100% accurate, but it's close enough. note areas of highest concentration - around novy and stary sobor, vybor, and between gorka/polana. i've found around 2 dozen heli crashes in these this past week, with 3/4ths of them at these areas. 

* if you've found a heli crash and you're sure you're the first to get to it (it still has nvg's or other grab-on-sight gear) it may be beneficial to camp the crash, if it's in an ambush-friendly area. things you'll want to look for: heavy cover at least 250m from the crash (so no zeds spawn while you lie in wait), a viewpoint of possible approaches, and a nearby place to stash your vehicle if you have one. the heli crash should be in enfilade from the heavy cover - meaning you should be looking at either the tail or the cockpit of the heli to minimize the amount of cover any other looters would have. [here's](http://i.imgur.com/KLjV7.jpg) a crappy diagram. in the diagram you are the blue x, the red x's are other players, and the grey sperm is the heli. the green turds around you are cover, preferably halfway up a hill overlooking the heli itself. if you have a sniper rifle, figure out the range beforehand so your first shot takes out a player right away. once you start shooting, you need to have eliminated everyone within 3 seconds or else you risk giving the enemy time to prepare a response. leave a couple of inconsequential guns around the crash (bizons or fn fals) or if you're really sadistic, some civilian clothing. people NEVER check the surroundings when they think they can get a ghillie or camo clothing for free. 

**Misc Tips:**

* sniping positions - if you have the time, go on a server with 0 players and just troll around at the popular sniping areas. you'll get to know what ranges various targets are, what's visible and what isn't, and where the blind spots are. if you ever need to take out a troublesome sniper, you'll know how to approach and where not to go. there are some good counter-sniping positions around elektro, cherno, zelenogorsk, stary, novy, vybor, and NWAF - you just have to find them. hint: they're usually in a lower position from the usual sniping spots, but when you look at the popular areas any targets will silhouette themselves against either the sky or the mountainside. 

* thermal imaging does not go through unbroken windows! be warned, if you've got yourself a nice new shiny L85.

* audible range for other player's running footsteps at max volume (for me) is around 30 meters. test it out on your sound system, because it may be nearer or further depending on your tolerance for eardrum-breaking gunshot sounds.

* download [the shooting range](http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=14616) for arma2 to practice your aim. when firing at a target, your first shot should always hit! practice with all the guns if you can, so if you find something new you aren't practicing on zeds, which is a waste of ammo. each gun has a different recoil pattern and effective range, and sometimes you can use this to your advantage. the m4a1/m4a1 cco pulls slightly up and to the right, and at 75m you can get a headshot on the second bullet in a 2-3 round burst if you aim at the target's left shoulder. little things like that can add up, and make a difference. 

* as much as possible don't mess too much with your FOV settings because it'll throw off the zeroing for sniper rifles! the dmr in particular is badly affected by this, since it cannot be zeroed - you'll have to figure out the proper ranging and zeroing values on your own. if you absolutely have to see more of the landscape while running around, tap the numpad minus key twice instead for a wider view. it'll be reset if you aim down the sight.

that's it for now, i'll add any other tips i think of within the day.

This is basically a broken leak, and shouldn't be touched, 
To quote a dev ""Yea im being told the files where internal testing only, Zombies are not agroing.""


*EDIT 1
To make it clear. YES there was going to be a release today, and there might still be one. the problem here is. 

a) six launcher pushed the client files too soon, which is why there is no forum announcement yet. 

b) the server files are a unfinished, they are bugged internal test release. which means none of the servers are working correctly

*EDIT 2
DayZ twitter confirms and links forumpost with more info

*EDIT 3 
Sixlauncher, just pushed 1.7.2.3. BUT there still no official announcement, and i haven't heard anything from the devs yet, so DO NOT UPGRADE JUST YET

i hope this is the final edit.

I get it, we all want to play the standalone Dayz, but to act actually request for the devs to rush the game is the worst possible thing we can do right now. 

Would you rather play the game now and have it be broken, unfinished and generally rushed, or instead you can play it when the Alpha is released and while there will still be some bugs and such it will be a much better experience.

This outcry towards the delay is actually enraging. Life doesn't revolve around Dayz, there are lots of other things to do and other games to play during the wait.

Seriously, just let the devs do their work and in the end you'll all be treated to a really well crafted (alpha) game in the near future.

1357752061.0	169a1v	The humanity system is seriously broken	fredwilsonn	312	75	184	"A few months ago, I was ambushed by several players, they engaged me for trespassing their encampment and in an effort for survival I killed some of them. There were one or two heroes among them, and in killing them I lost a significant amount of humanity.

5 months later, I still am a bandit. I don't ever really kill anyone unless they are a threat to me or someone else.

The problem is that I am constantly distrusted by players. Heroes know that they don't lose humanity for killing me and they don't want to take a chance with me. I am being constantly punished for a mistake I made 5 months ago.

For me to restore my humanity, I would have to give a hundred or two blood transfusions. This is virtually impossible.

The system has to be changed to allow players to shift their humanity with a reasonable amount of effort. There should be a minimum amount of humanity to prevent situations like the one I had, say -10000, and Heroes should lose humanity for killing any player when out of combat, bandit or otherwise.

Also losing humanity should not be based on the enemies humanity. It should be a flat rate like -750 per bandit kill, -1000 per survivor and -1500 per hero killed. You should also lose humanity for other actions, such as looting too much stuff (by measuring what the player needs and detecting if he is too greedy).

Humanity also needs to slowly crawl towards zero, at the rate of, for example, 1 humanity every fifteen seconds. This forces heroes to maintain their image and forgives bandits over time.

Please upvote this if you agree so someone on the community dev team can see, I gain no karma for it.

**TL;DR:** Humanity is not an effective measure of a players ethics, and it's too hard to get out of negative humanity. Change the way humanity is measured and make it neutral over time. Not doing so ruins the game for even some of the most humane players and creates a strange hierarchy. "	t5_2ty3s	True

I was being the good friend that I am and covering my friends from a sniper location as we made a run into starry sobor. I was at X location and could see all over the city and outside it. No zombies spawned or any players anywhere in sight. It was then once two of our guys made it into the tents did we then start to hear gunshots and one guy starts to bleed. I turn towards the direction of the shots origin and there I see it, a guy in a ghillie suit in the trees whose name i did not catch. He had drawn zombie aggro from shooting from what looked like an m16... why he would try to snipe from about 300 meters away with an m16 was beyond me as he only did 2k ish damage to my friend.

As the zombies run towards him i see him suddenly disconnect, how shitty of him. It was then however that i saw another female beside him and caught your name. Unfortunately you were about as douchey as your friend and I saw you d/c to lobby.

You should have straight up left the server however. As I sat.. and waited, from about 700 meters away watching your name in the lobby, with my crosshairs on your location until finally it happend. I saw your icon change and knew you were loading in.

You appeared right there and went prone immediately. From there I think you know the rest.. about 5 seconds later after i got my zeroing on, your body exploded into gibby treats as my 50cal m107 destroyed the ever loving shit out of you.

I do thank you though, it was the first time that night I got to fire my 50cal, both times covering my friends and I do love the sound of that cannon going off. The moral of the story here however is if you're going to try to d/c to save your life. D/c all the way.. because i'm watching... with my 50cal and my beans... and I have a lot of beans."	t5_2ty3s	True

I'm in the back of their truck and we're driving. By now we're voice chatting. They park and think I'm out of the vehicle, I hear the say, ""Let's kill Ghost and take his gear."" 



One problem. I'm Ghost. 




So I'm in the back of their car, with their gear. I take their weapons and arm up without telling them then I ask then to pull over, because I have to eat. They stop the car in the middle of the night, and I get out. The passenger gets out and I manage to kill him. The other hits me in the leg but he only had a makarov, so I finished him off by breaking his legs with a few rounds. I then threw a flare and backed up as I watched zombies swarm his corpse.

So if I've missed your bad ass idea please let me know and I'll add it. But **please** keep it brief so it'll be easier to add.

Also, please help me confirm what is already being implemented in SA. Once that is all finished I'll create a final thread with a legend and everything. Thanks and enjoy!

EDIT: If you think of something completely new because of this list, please feel free to share and it'll be added.

EDIT EDIT: Keep in mind each original suggestion was much more in depth with quite a bit of back and forth from the community (some really good ones too).....I'm just streamlining the idea for ease of reading.

**ANIMATIONS** (*felt like this might warrant it's own section, some good ideas in this dept*)

- Sneezing

- Animations for the various medical applications

- [Commo Rose] (http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120415234803/battlefield/images/d/de/CommoRoseBF3.png) to bring up the various animations


**BALANCING**

- Remove spawn locations

- Increased sound range for guns

- Barb wire should have a small % chance to cut you

- Buff the crossbow

- Less ammo 

- Less powerful guns

- Lots more bicycles 

- Vehicles more common, but gas hard to come by

- Spawn stories (falling out of a plain, waking up in hospital, crashed airplane, docked boat, etc) rather than *everyone* spawning on shore


**ENDGAME** (*please consider more options here....this one is huge to many of us*)

- Generators (large and small) for night time lighting

- Elektro powerstation can be restored

- Radio towers allowing people to broadcast messages to other towers

- Base construction (above &amp; below ground)

- Portions of the map that crossover onto other maps/servers (different ""worlds"")

**ENVIRONMENT**

- All buildings enterable

- Develop the northern portion of the map

- Balance the ""attractions"" across the map (as in survivor destinations)

- Sewer system under a few a few of the major Towns

- Cooking elements other than a camp fire (wood stove, propane cookers, boiling, etc)

- If you drink so many sodas consecutively you'll get a headache and your aim well be slightly off

**HUD/GRAPHICS**

- No more kill indicators in bottom left, force the survivor to verify the kill if they want the gear (and don't make this a server side option either)

**ITEMS**

- Books that ""teach"" you skills in the world, once read you've acquired the skill and can be given to friends (pilot books, mechanics books, medical books) (*essentially, fresh survivors have limited skill sets*)

- Space blankets, found in grocery stores and fires stations; alternative to heat packs/fires (shiny in nature...so risky to use)

- Tools to barricade doors

- Sound decoys

- Lighters/zippos

**NIGHTTIME**

- Headlamps (which are confirmed by Rocket) 

- Shoulder/TAC Vest mounted flashlights 

- Generators for nighttime lighting that must be powered by flatbed gasoline trucks (towed flatbeds?) 

- Night never becomes *completely* black, slight visibility at it's lowest point and then brighter from there

Names such as DerpHooves Canned Muffins , R4Z0R, and mZLY yZLY soda. 

In my opinion (and several other redditors) these names ruin the immersion and atmosphere of the game and it almost seems as if the mods are just on an ~~ego-trip and want some internet fame.~~ 

(Mods had nothing to do with it I found out rather quickly)

If anyone of you are actually bothered enough by this, please help try and appeal to the Dev Team for a change in these horrendous names. 

Please go to the topic I made [here on the DayZ Forums](http://dayzmod.com/forum/index.php?/topic/125658-new-food-and-drinks-names/) where the mods are more likely to see our complaints, and post about how much you dislike it and why. Hopefully by doing this the Mods/DevTeam will realize that this is detrimental to gameplay and that there is a large demand to change the names.

Check out this [thread](http://dayzmod.com/forum/index.php?/topic/125687-176-cans-and-drinks/) it is a response from R4Z0R.  This just goes to show that mods are open and willing to work with the community or they didn't want to hear us complain.

1338217182.0	u8rb2	The map is 255km, why does everyone insist on staying in Cherno/Electro and the whining about how often they get killed by other players?	Subhazard	269	39	207	"Seriously, I don't get it.  Every day there's a new post complaining about bandits, or how much the game is a death match. Every day I see people asking 'Is someone shooting in cherno' **yes of course dummy, someone is always shooting in cherno**

We live in Zel, and we see a survivor maybe once every hour, and most of the time they're friendly. That's not even that far north.

Why do you people *insist* on constantly complaining about your lack of an ability to adapt? It's really getting super grating, to the point where I feel like unsubscribing.

Another thing is PVP. It's part of the game, it's what adds tension, and it's why we have other guns besides the winchester. After about a week of playing, you learn how to fight zombies pretty well. If I were chased by 20 zombies, and all I had was a 1911, I could take all of them and survive.

No that's not me trying to be a badass, it really gets that easy.

If all we had to worry about was zombies, the game would get boring so fast. PVP, and playing the role of the bandit is part of the game. Stop getting angry about that, stop -hating- other people in -real life- for the role they want to play in the game.

From my experience and perspective, DayZ PVP is just like Minecraft PVP. High stakes, lots of travel time, and meaningful.  I think people get angry about PVP in DayZ because they've never experienced PVP in a game where there was actually something to lose.  Back in the day MUDs were like that (multi-user dungeons, text based multiplayer games).  You'd build up your character, and get a bunch of gear, and then someone would kill you, but that was just the lay of the land. Rather than bitching and moaning about it like a little crybaby, you adapted, and then came out on top.

So please, stop whining, remember that this is a survival game, and also a -game- and you shouldn't hate people for playing the game like its intended to be played because you refuse to adapt.

When I get killed, I enjoy it, because no other game has made me feel so strongly about my death other than Minecraft. I also remember that it's a game."	t5_2ty3s	True

You might say that some of these don't count because they are sequels. But each of these 'sequels' is merely the standalone adaptation of the mod, with the '2' in the name necessitated by the time and technology gap between releases.

Noteworthy is the comparison between Counter-Strike and DayZ. Unlike the DayZ standalone, Valve's first Counter-Strike release was essentially a HL mod packaged into a standalone game. Had DayZ been similarly fast-tracked as originally planned, the development time to alpha release would have been just a few months. Considering the extensive re-write we're getting, a year starts to look far less dramatic than some of the commentary would suggest.

All data quickly mined from Wikipedia (obviously) - I don't claim to be an authority on the topic. Corrections, flames and discussion welcomed.

**Original Post - 2/17**

I have been playing DayZ for a good while now, at least 8+ months now or so. I remember when the game was still new (before the massive spike of new players) and people were more friendly and open to working together.

Now today the game is a highly shoot on sight type of game and I find myself getting tired of the game quickly. What I believe needs to happen is that the zombies need to be almost ridiculously strong and scary to counterbalance this shoot on sight gameplay. 

Currently no one is afraid to fire a gun because zombies are a joke. Firing a weapon in a city should be essentially a death wish. Think the first season of The Walking Dead with Rick in Atlanta. ~~Zombies should difficult to kill except by headshots or strong weapons (which should be hard to find at that).~~ *See Below* This means that if you are by yourself, then a single zombie is manageable, two is panic inducing, but more than that and you pretty *have* to run.

I know to many it is backwards logic but if you make the environment over the top harsh, out-to-kill-you harsh, ~~even some loners will be forced to work together if they want to survive.~~ *Retracted. We don't want to FORCE teamwork but make it a more attractive option for those that wish to do so.*

Imagine this: Two people meeting in the city but if either of them fires they will also die because of the environmental threat. Either you use a melee weapon or are forced to work together, even just temporarily, in order to survive.

**People bond and develop strong friendships out of times of hardship.** If you make the environment extremely, over the top harsh, then I believe you will create the right environment to force people to work together,  but also thru working together in that harsh environment, you also ironically create a better chance for strong partnerships to form between individuals that at first might not.

---------

**Update 1 - 2/17 - Concerning Banditry**

My hopes are that the threshold level of difficulty would be enough that it mitigates the uselessness of killing new spawns and players with hardly anything because of a combination of zombie threat and ammo/supplies scarcity.

If anything, my hopes for bandits is that it creates more situations for people to work together for hard goals, which then could create interesting betrayal situations for those of you that enjoy the banditry side of things. In a sense, *it should also actually make banditry much more rewarding.*

Example for 'up-close' Banditry: In another post in this thread was mentioned about two player plus only actions. ~~I brought up an example of requiring two people and a crowbar to open a gun case in a police station.~~ *Retracted example - need better suggestions.* If you decide banditry is your thing, you can betray him after that if you so wish. By nature of the need to work together up to that point, it should make it a more interesting decision at that time than just this bland shoot on sight mechanic that is is currently. What creative ways can you come up with to make someone trust you to get some really nice weapons out of that locker, betray him and get away with it?

On the other hand as well, if you are more of a bandit from a distance, the fact that more people are working together means they will likely produce better results in their journey as far as looting and gather resources. Therefore when you take advantage of them, kill them, whatever, then they are likely to be just as much, *if not a better resource* as scavenging.

-----

**TL;DR for the suggestions within the comments**

1. *Obviously zombie glitchiness needs to be addressed first and foremost*, which rocket has stated is a priority. This will address many issues with immersion, fighting, and pretty much everything else.
2. *Zombies don't necessarily need a damage boost but their numbers should be much greater.* This would address the idea of making shooting in a city a weighted decision, but not make zombies totally ridiculous individually. 
[Comment 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/18pm56/rocket_the_zombies_need_to_be_over_the_top_scary/c8gvvyh) 
3. *Zombie numbers should be relative to the reasonable population size of the area.* If it's a city like cherno, you would expect there to reasonably be maybe at least 500+ people that used to live there. Wouldn't you expect there to be at least 200+ zombies then? Obviously the loot should also be much greater as well comparative to that, making cities a high risk, high reward scenario. **Counterpoint:** Server incapability to support the sheer number of mobs? Something to be investigated.
4. I will leave my original suggestion in the post about about 'only headshots' for sake of continuity for later readers but I will *retract* my idea of it in light of another suggestion. *If the infection is fully defined* in what it does, how it works, etc, that could lead to some better and more interesting gameplay mechanics as to how zombies take damage, their condition and ability to fight, how easy it is to kill them, etc.

5. *Zombies need to be more dimwitted.* They should not automatically know where a noise is coming from but start investigating in that direction when they hear it. This would make navigating infected cities with large mobs not impossible, but still a challenge like it should be. An example of this would be intentionally setting off a noise in a different direction to create an escape route, such as blowing up a can of gasoline, a car or something of that nature.
[Comment 1,](http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/18pm56/rocket_the_zombies_need_to_be_over_the_top_scary/c8gv5ev) [Comment 2,](http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/18pm56/rocket_the_zombies_need_to_be_over_the_top_scary/c8gy2p2) [Comment 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/18pm56/rocket_the_zombies_need_to_be_over_the_top_scary/c8h1dcs)
6. *Zombies shouldn't be able to run like a track star.* If anything, the fresher ones could *hobble fast* but, at least to me, it doesn't make sense that a living infected/animated corpse/(insert your zombie versino) that only thinks about feeding on humans should still have the coordination and ability to do full bodied sprints. [Comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/18pm56/rocket_the_zombies_need_to_be_over_the_top_scary/c8gycp3)
7. *Suicide should be an option.* And I don't mean just hitting the respawn button. Let's say I'm stuck in the city with one guy (that I don't like) and I feel like I want to take the easy way out and cap myself. However, the other guy wants to live and doesn't want me shoot my head off cause then it'll hinder his chances to escape with the gunshot noise. It would make for some interesting roleplay type situations where perhaps he'll panic and chop me up with an axe before I can kill myself and a struggle ensues.
8. *It should be harder to incur injuries.* Try to make someone bleed with just your hands. Or better yet, try to break someones leg with your own strength. How hard is that? Bleeding, broken bones, etc should be much less likely to occur. Getting attacked by zombies should in the first moments be more like a grappling situation where they grab you and slow you down perhaps. You should be able to knock them back and move a break away. Instead of taking blood damage, perhaps introduce a secondary value of fatigue. Running a lot in one go, being grabbed by a bunch of zombies, being shot (varying by the pentration location even) all should have varying levels of fatigue associated with them. As you become more fatigued, you have trouble running, climbing and performing any task. This means you have to evaluate your choices much more in just about everything.
9. *Going unconcious from being smacked by zombies should not happen.* Getting hit hard on the back of the head is the only melee related option that makes sense. Response to a post:

&gt; Unless you get very low on blood (which should be harder with the lessened bleeding chance), sick/diseased, or get whacked in the head by a player, it should be very difficult to go unconscious. Wouldn't it be fantastic to be able to knock someone out from behind and take them hostage or use them as bait? It would open up so many options for alternate options of escape if I could knock out a guy, drag his body into the street and use him as bait to escape the other way. Morbid, but really would add depth.

**Update post on 2/18:**
This post has gotten a lot of feedback and I am doing my best to read and examine every comment and try to consolidate them together. I do not have any issues with rebuttals, in fact we need more of that because as nice as it is, just a bunch of people saying ""that's a good idea"" doesn't actually bring up multiple points of views to come up with better solutions. So please do keep them coming! I plan to read through everything again and change, amend and clarify some of the ideas in the above post to make it easy and neat for rocket and team to read thru the suggestions. Thanks everyone! 

**Current Question of the Day:** What are some ways we can create benefits for different playstyles but not create too strong of an advantage for them, such as solo play versus teaming up? Two player actions such as helping each other over an obstacle was a good suggestion but something like only being able to open an ammo crate with two people wasn't a favorable suggestion. What could be done for this?

-------

[I would also like to give attention to this post as well](http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/18pm56/rocket_the_zombies_need_to_be_over_the_top_scary/c8h8gmm) by [ervashi.](http://www.reddit.com/user/ervashi) Arguably, some of these suggestions might actually make zombies *easier* on the other hand, and not more terrifying as my original intentions are with this thread. Perhaps the question is this: What constitutes terrifying? What sort of things make encountering zombies scary? I would love to see some discussion on his post.

* Suggestion 1 - If slower and dimwitted, damage should be high
* Suggestion 2 - If faster and smarter, damage should be lower
* Other Suggestions?

**Compromise Suggestion:** After reviewing many of the suggestions and ideas, what about this for a possible idea: The idea of zombies in varying states of decay has come up before. What if the less decayed they are, the more agile they were, but their damage lower to counterbalance their agility. Then for the ones more decayed, the slower they are but also the more infectious their damage would be, such as possibility of infecting the player. Basically you would have both types of zombies and the combination of the two together would create some interesting gameplay mechanics.

----

**2/19 Mini-Update**

Just looking at one of the suggestions that was debated a bit earlier. One possible solution for the solo vs team play balancing concerning the example of the ammo locker originally only openable by two people:

&gt; There should be options for solo players and teammates but there are pros and cons to each.
Say maybe there only spawns two good rifles and 2 mags each to keep it balanced.
Solo Pro: One primary for your person and your bag and decent amount of ammo. Con: A little more difficult to open on your own, perhaps noise risk.
Team Pro: Less risky and easier to open. Con: Have to split the ammo. If teaming up with a random person, betrayal factor.

At the moment the best option to survive is to run away and lose them.  Guns are only really used on other players (except pistols I guess).  The only time ive really hunted down and killed multiple zombies is when i'm dying of hunger looking for beans or when I have a shit load of gear and I'm bored.  

How about some incentive to actually kill zombies? With the new crafting system, maybe certain types of zombies could drop items which can't be found lying about? Kind of like how crash site pilots used to (?) drop NVG.  
doctor zombies drop rare surgical supplies?
mechanics drop rare vehicle repair items?

I think these items should be completely optional end game stuff though, to eliminate any need for farming.
