Never use diet colas in your slow cooker	farnswiggle	331	41	85	"I keep seeing recipes for Coke roasts and Gingerale pulled pork and thought I should give it a try with the pork I've been mulling over. I don't drink (or buy) pop but my mom had given me some of the left over Cherry Coke Zero from christmas, so I thought it could work. Maybe a little sweeter than regular coke, but still probably great.


So very wrong. 


The smell that came out of the slow cooker after a couple of hours was atrocious, bitter, chemically and nauseating. I've never been closer to being sick in my life. There was a strange thick foamy film on the top of the liquid and it clung to my pork like it had a mind of its own. I almost gagged many times while pouring the strangely clear liquid down the drain. I cleaned the crockpot while it was still scorching hot  in an attempt to alleviate the smell. 


Luckily the pork was fine. I scraped the foamy gelatinous goo off of it, shredded it and smothered it in bbq sauce and onions. Returned all of that to the slowcooker and gave it another hour on low and it ended up being delicious. 


TLDR; NEVER put anything with aspartame in the slow cooker unless you have a VERY strong stomach"	t5_2s64w	True
1369930431.0	1fcdk1	Made honey garlic chicken in the slow cooker and it is delicious, not to mention a very simple undertaking.	leftopinkocommie	335	51	47	"3 lbs boneless skinless chicken breasts (thighs would work as well)
8 oz steak sauce (A1 or any off brand is fine)
4 oz of honey
1.5 tsp Sriracha or other hot pepper sauce
2 cloves garlic - minced
1 tsp garlic powder (if you don't have fresh garlic use 2 tsp garlic powder)

Mix the sauces and garlic/garlic powder together and pour it over the chicken breasts in the slow cooker.

Cook it on high for 2.5 hours and then gear it down to low for 4.5 hours.

Remove the now exceptionally tender and fall apart wonderful chicken breasts from the slow cooker, leaving the sauce.

Use 2 forks to pull the chicken and return to the slow cooker and the delicious sauce.

Let the chicken and the sauce co-mingle for a half hour or so and dig in.

1371496329.0	1gj7sk	Recently Joined - thought I would share my retired competition chili recipe	tambor333	322	47	58	"The beanless / non slow cooker version of this has won 5 competitions in the bay area over the years before I retired it. Current recipe below has won many ad hoc “ chili cook-offs and hot lucks"" sponsored by my companies and church since adapting it for a slow cooker. Some might note that this looks similar to America's test kitchen's chili, this recipe pre-dates that one by a decade.

The anchos chiles and the browned tomato paste give it an earthy flavor and deep mahogany color. You can play with the heat a bit but don’t skip the chipotle or anchos since they are flavor components.

California Wildfire with Black Beans 

* 2 ½ lbs. Beef Chuck boned, trimmed and cubed into ½ in. cubes 
* 6 thick cut or 12 thin cut rashers of bacon diced 
* 1 large white or yellow onion chopped fine 
* 7 – 10 cloves of Garlic smashed and chopped fine 
* 10 to 12 Dried Ancho chiles 
* 2 or 3 dried or fresh whole cayenne chilies ( Can be any hot variety ) 
* 3 Serrano fresh chiles chopped fine ( Can be any hot variety ) 
* 1 Tablespoon Chipotle powder 
* 3 Tablespoon Tomato Paste 
* 2 Tablespoons Cumin seeds 
* 2 Tablespoons Mexican Oregano 
* 2 Tablespoons honey ( optional ) 
* 1 Small Can Swanson’s beef stock ( low sodium ) 
* 24 Oz Cevesa Tecate beer ( room temp ) For those with alcohol sensitivity use 2 O’douls amber or other non alcoholic malt beverages 
* 2 small cans black beans rinsed and drained 
* 1 cup Masa Harina (Corn Flour) 
* Salt and Pepper 

Preheat your oven to 375˚ F. Toast your dried chiles for 5 to 7 minutes on a sheet pan then soak in warm water to re hydrate. Cube Beef into ½ inch cubes set aside. In a bowl or zip top bag mix 1 cup masa harina and salt and pepper then coat the beef cubes knocking off the excess. In a large Pan render the diced bacon. Remove bacon to the slow cooker and brown the beef in small batches, reserve beef in the slow cooker with bacon and add chopped onions and garlic to the pan and soften add tomato paste and stir till it turns a mahogany color. Add the cumin and oregano (that has been ground in a spice mill or mortar). Seed and stem the re hydrated chile and puree in blender or food processor then add to the pot. Add the fresh Serrano chile and Chipotle powder. Add the beef stock and beer. Slow cook on high for 4 hours or low for 8 to 10 hours or until the meat is tender. Add the drained black beans in the last 30 minutes of cooking. 

Add Salt and pepper to taste. Optional: add a little honey to round out the flavors if the chiles are a little bitter. The sauce if loose can be tightened with some more masa harina. Top with grated cheese, sour cream, chopped red onions etc…. 

Variations: Add cubed pork butt for deeper flavor. Try a sweeter beer like Newcastle brown or ale. Almost any chile will work in this as well. Add 2 oz of dark chocolate for a mole type flavor.

Edit: fixed the spelling of Tecate

1359664800.0	17nert	The only Pulled Pork recipe you'll ever need	sirkerrald	254	58	84	"I've been making this one for several years. It's super simple, super cheap, and you're welcome to use any sauce you want. I now get requests around super bowl time for this one:

**1 4-5lb Pork Butt/Shoulder**

**2 Large White or Yellow Onions** (larger the better)

**1 Bottle your favorite bbq sauce** (Personally, I prefer a Carolina gold style with this, but if I gotta go with a sweet tomato-y one, Jack Daniel's No.7 is my choice of the moment. Also worth trying with Jamaican Jerk, comes out incredibly well).

**1 Tea Spoon Liquid Smoke** (if you don't plan on using a smokey style sauce... let's face it, slow cooking imparts no smoke).

**1 Cup Ginger Beer or Ginger Ale** (save a little extra too)

**Dry rub mix** (currently I use Bad Byron's Butt Rub).



Slice both onions and layer the bottom of the slow cooker with one of the onions. Add your ginger beer/ale, smoke, and sprinkle a bit of your dry rub seasoning of choice. Place your pork fatty side up on the bed of onions, layer with remaining onions, sprinkle with dry rub and add a bit of moisture with a bit of additional ginger beer/ale. Cover, and let cook over night on **LOW** for 12 hours.

By now you'll see that the meat pulls apart almost effortlessly. Technically you're good to go, but this is where you'll want to drain it, pull it, add your sauce, and stick it back in the slow cooker for another 4-6 hours. In that time your pork will come out as tender, moist, and flavorful as any you've experienced.

Some of the ingredients in this will be sort of an approximation. For example, I didn’t use a measuring spoon for the paprika but I figured it was about a tablespoon worth. I also did the 2 ½ of the taco seasoning because that’s usually the amount that comes in a packet of taco seasoning. You can of course, add as much or as little seasonings to suit your tastes though. The taco seasoning and the cumin aren’t pictured below because I took them from plastic bags I had. When I worked as a cook I went through the spice collection to get some freebies for home :) The brand is “Trade East” since we purchased from GFS. Also, for the recipe I needed a food processor. These things are dynamite for a kitchen!*

**[Chipotle Chicken Tacos](http://imgur.com/a/ZACCu)**

__Ingredients__

-	`2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breast`
-	`Small can (7.5oz) of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce`
-	`1 bottle (16oz) of medium chunky salsa`
-	`2 bell peppers (I used half of the 4 of each color)`
-	`1 small sweet onion (I used ¾ of the one pictured)`
-	`1 whole head/bulb of garlic`
-	`1 can of corn`
-	`1 can of black beans`
-	`2 ½ tablespoons of taco seasoning`
-	`1 tablespoon of cumin`
-	`1 tablespoon of paprika`
-	`Lime juice`
-	`Cilantro`
-	`Salt/Pepper`
-	`Olive oil`


1.) Start by emptying the whole bottle of salsa into the slow cooker.

2.) Get the strainer out and strain the can of corn under water and add that to the pot.

3.) Then chop up your onions and peppers and add those to the pot as well. I liked to keep them in strips instead of dicing them.

4.) Next, add your garlic cloves to the food processor sans skin. I added the whole head/bulb.

5.) Then I added enough lime juice into the processor to just not quite submerge the garlic cloves. I don’t know if it’s bad to use this much/little of lime juice, but I’m no culinary genius and I wing it with slow cooking friends!

6.) Then open your can of chipotle peppers. I’m not sure how many comes in a can but I used about 8 peppers and a couple spoonfuls of the adobo sauce contained therein. I think that’s pretty much the whole can, so screw it if you’re like me and love spicy food AND chipotles!

7.) If you’re using fresh cilantro you can add it to the processor at this point. My grocery store only had dried, but if you’re not trying to puree the cilantro, just chop it up on the counter and add it later with the other spices. I probably added 1 ½ tablespoons give or take of the dried.

8.) Now process that sh*t! I do it long enough to where the garlic pieces look like minced garlic contained in a delicious crimson chipotle liquid. Mmmmmm.

9.) Now add that to the slow cooker along with your spices (taco seasoning, cumin, paprika, cilantro, salt/pepper, olive oil). I don’t add much salt since most everything has it already in it. As for the olive oil, I just pour an “S” shape inside the bowl. Just enough so that the oil will become infused with all the flavors, and melt into the food later when we shred the chicken.

10.) Now for the chicken. I did a bit of trimming just to get any excess fat off (some is good), then cut each large honking breast into 2 pieces. Add that to the slow cooker and mix her all up.

11.) I put it on high for the first 2 hours, and then took it down to low on the last 4, stirring here and there. About 6 hours in total plus or minus.

12.) Before the last hour though, pull out the pieces of chicken and shred them with 2 forks to your desired size/consistency. Put the chicken back into the pot.

13.) Get out your strainer again and strain the black beans under some water. Then add to the slow cooker.

14.) Keep it on low for that last hour and then you’re done! 


*---- I don’t add any water to the pot when I make this because by the time you’re halfway done, all the juices from the veggies and such have already filled it making it sort of a stew. Then the shredded chicken will absorb the rest, flavor and all. You could probably even add another half pound of chicken if you were inclined to. In fact, when I re-heat the stuff before putting it in a tortilla, I cook/heat it in a [pan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt-zz4LcxX8) so it can reduce most of the liquid away so it's not too drippy. I put cheese and sour cream on the tacos and pieces of avocado if I’m feeling rich. This is my first recipe on here and was inspired by a previous [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/18fx90/trying_out_my_new_slowcooker/) someone made. You could probably turn this into a chip dip too if you added cheese and sour cream to the slow cooker halfway. My roommate puts it on a half of a baked sweet potato if you don't like tortillas. Whatever floats your boat i guess. I hope you guys enjoy it as much as I do! Lots of leftovers and satisfied bellies :)*

1 Top Round Roast, sliced into 5 big steak-like hunks

1 yellow onion

scallions

1 cup soy sauce

1 cup water

1/2 cup of brown sugar (or more, to taste)

1-2 inches fresh ginger

4 cloves garlic

Sesame oil (optional)



Throw your big hunks of meat into the crock.


In a skillet, saute ginger and garlic in a small amount of vegetable oil. Once lightly browned, add soy sauce, water and brown sugar. Stir until combined and let bubble to thicken. 


At this point, if it's not thick enough, you can add a little corn starch slurry (1 tbs corn starch mixed with a bit of water). 


Pour into crock pot. 



Slice onion and add to hot skillet, saute until lightly softened/browned, about 2 minutes. Add that to the crock pot. 



Cook for 8 hours on low. Remove beef and shred (should be extremely easy). Return to crock for another 1-2 hours on low. (9-10 total). Add scallions and sesame oil to taste. Serve over rice. "	t5_2s64w	True

2-1/2 cups chocolate chips.

1/4 cup coconut milk, (canned)

1/4 cup maple syrup OR Honey OR golden syrup *

Dash of sea salt 

1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 






Mix chocolate chips, coconut milk, honey and salt, in your slow cooker and stir well. Cover and cook on low heat for two hours **without removing the lid or stirring**.



After two hours, take off the lid, add in your vanilla essence (or you could use another flavouring if you like) and stir well. Leave to cool to room temperature, which takes about 4 hours.



Once cool, it should have a very shiny glossy look - stir it for a good 5-10 minutes, until you see it starting to dull in colour. Spray a dish with non stick cooking spray, or line with clingfilm, and pour in the fudge. Pop in the fridge for another 4 hours until it sets, cut, eat, and enjoy.




Experiment with flavourings - the chocolate is actually necessary to help it to set, I've tried reducing the amount of chocolate and ended up with a very nice fudge sauce. I like to add a few raisins and a dash of rum. I also find peppermint flavouring works well.



*The original recipe I found called for honey. This worked out quite well, but I have several vegetarian friends that couldn't eat any. I then tried maple syrup instead, which I have to say tasted wonderful. Golden syrup also works in a pinch, but feel free to play around and see what works for you. Agave nectar has also been suggested as a vegan substitute for the honey, but I've not tried it myself."	t5_2s64w	True

I'd never used a gas oven before going to China so my first thirty attempts often started small catastrophes.

I decided the easiest thing to do would be buying a slow cooker so I could just toss things into a pot with ease and live on simple soups and stews.

I'd bought a slow cooker back home, where the voltage is 110/60, and brought it to China (220/50).

I'm not a fool, I did buy a power adapter/convertor, and I gleefully set about preparing my first dish.

The main issue with my slow cooker (a gen-u-wine crock pot) was that it had no indicator light. Plug and Pray if you will. I plugged it in, nothing happened, so I set a timer for four hours and went to work in my living room.

After an hour - nothing. The thing was unusually cool to the touch but I figured, ""well, it is a *slow* cooker..."" so I waited another hour.

It was still cold by the second hour so I checked that everything was plugged in. When I removed the cord from my adapter there was a huge spark, a small fire on my counter, and tons of ozone in the air.

I have no idea why my adapter (that had worked fine for my N64 days earlier) decided it didn't like my slow cooker.

I want to thank you all for giving me hope with a lot of great recipes and ideas. You're a cool community but my kitchen gremlins won't let me join.

TL;DR: North American crock pot and Chinese power adapter go to war. Everyone loses, especially my dinner.

**edit:** Sorry for the confusion: I bought an adapter *AND* power convertor "	t5_2s64w	True

I got a 2 pound pork roast, put it in the crock pot to cook all day with some chipotle sauce. I decided to use chipotle sauce instead of the usual BBQ/BBQ+soda routine to try something new, and it was awesome. Best part is the chipotle sauce is dirt cheap. I paid 50 cents for a can of it from the mexican section of the grocery store. 

I added my sauce and meat at the same time, so it was a bit watery (if people remember my question from after I did that) but if I had cooked the pork, drained it, then added the sauce, or at least more chipotle sauce I think it would be even better.

But I made it into burritos, which was amazing. I topped them with some home made pico de gallo and some cheese. Divine.

I had some left overs on tortilla chips, which was also delicious, it would make a delicious nacho option.

I was trying to find a copy of J.Gumbos voodoo chicken and had little success. I finally came across this recipe and set about adapting it for a slow cooker. Its not J.Gumbos but I really enjoy it. 


Notable changes:
Use only 1/4 tsp of the thyme and oregano. After being in the slow cooker they tend to over power it a bit. 
I also use a small can of petite diced tomatoes or rotel rather than paste. 

Recipe I used:

4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves (About 2 lbs) 

4 tablespoons butter

3 cloves garlic, minced

1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper

1 teaspoon paprika

1/4 teaspoon thyme

1/4 teaspoon oregano

1/2 teaspoon parsley


1/2 teaspoon garlic powder

1/2 bay leaf, crushed (don't use the ""spine""!)

1/4-1/2 dried chili, crushed (or more)

1/2 teaspoon seasoning salt

1 TBS Tabasco sauce (or hot sauce of choice)

2 teaspoons brown sugar

1 small can of petite diced tomatoes or rotel

optiona
l
1 can of whole kernel corn

1 can of black beans


Place everything in the slow cooker except the corn and beans and set on high for 4-5 hours or low for 6-8 or until the chicken is fork tender.
 
Remove the chicken and shred then add back into the slow cooker for another hour on low. 
At the shredding stage add in the can of whole kernel corn, (drained)  and rinsed and drained black beans. 

Serve over rice to make this a hearty meal or my favorite was is over tortilla chips topped with jalapenos, green onions, cheese and sour cream.
 
Enjoy

This is a pair of dishes we like to do together, there's barely any cooking involved, and they couldn't be simpler!  Enjoy!

**Day 1: Slow-Cooked Lemon Herb Chicken Legs**  
Source recipe: [MSPI Mama](http://www.mspimama.com/2012/03/slow-cooked-chicken-drumsticks-with.html)  
Line the bottom of your slow cooker with about 4-6 thighs and top with 6-8 chicken legs (or another combination of parts).  Coat with a mixture of:  
Juice and zest of one lemon  
1 Tbsp olive oil  
2 Tbsp Italian blend spices  
2 tsp garlic powder  
Salt and pepper to taste

Cook on low about 7-8 hours or until chicken reaches a safe temperature.  For this meal you're only eating the legs, so save the thighs.  We usually serve with a veggie/pesto/pasta salad.


**Day 2: Avocado Lime Chicken Salad Rolls**  
Source recipe: [Becoming Betty](http://becomingbetty.blogspot.com/2011/09/avocado-chicken-salad.html)  
Remember those leftover thighs from last night that probably got a little too cooked on the bottom of the slow cooker?  Shred them up!  Mix them with:  
1-2 Avocados (depending on amount of chicken, size of avocados, and desired texture)  
1 tsp Mayonnaise  
Juice of one Lime  
Cilantro, green onion, salt and pepper to taste

Roll the chicken salad up in tortillas and serve with corn on the cob.

Because we typically have a lot of people show up, my crock pot has become my best friend for such an occasion. Need something hearty to feed a crowd? Try this soup recipe, and everyone will be asking for seconds! It's also a great recipe if you work or are gone long hours.

You will need a large crockpot for this particular recipe, but it's very easily halved.

**Crock Pot Potato Soup**

5 lbs of potatoes, roughly chopped*

1 med yellow onion, roughly chopped

8 cups of chicken broth

1 head of garlic, minced**

2 8oz packages of cream cheese

Bacon crumbles for topping (or really whatever you like.)

Place potatoes, onion, and garlic in crockpot. Fill with chicken broth. I know it looks like it's going to be a runny soup, but it'll work out in the end, I promise.

Cook on high for ~6 hours, or low for ~10 hours.

Before serving, cut the cream cheese in chunks and stir into soup. Let the cream cheese sit in the soup for ~10 minutes, then puree, top with bacon, cheese, whatever, and serve.

Soup will keep for about 5 to 7 days in the fridge.



*For the potatoes, I leave half with skin on, and half without

**Instead of using garlic, I used garlic infused chicken broth which turned out quite nicely and not quite as strong.

* 2 to 3 lbs beef (stew meat, roast, steak, or ground beef. if not ground beef then cut the meat into 1 to 2 inch pieces)
* 1 onion
* 1 15-oz can diced tomatoes
* 1 6-oz can tomato paste

* 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper (or more to taste)
* 1/2 tsp black pepper
* 1/2 tsp salt
* splash of yummy beer

brown the meat with the onion in a skillet then drain excess grease and fat. add garlic to the mix and cook for another minute or two. throw that and all the other ingredients in the slow cooker, give it a good stir and set it on low for 7 to 8 hours.

serve with optional toppings such as: shredded cheese, sour cream, raw chopped onion, ect. oh and some crackers or tortilla chips or cornbread on the side; whatever you want :) ok, i'm hungry now, off to the store to make this!

I didn't have the recipe on hand so I just winged it and it turned out really well. Unfortunately It was gone before I was able to think to get a picture.

The ingredents listed are the quantity I used but so long as the chicken is mostly covered it shouldn't make too much of a difference.

2-3 Boneless Skinless Chicken Breasts

2 cans of Cream of chicken (10.5 oz)

4 slices of Swiss cheese

1 box of chicken flavored stuffing 

Season to taste, I used a combination of pepper, seasoned salt and garlic powder

It was very easy to make

1. Add Cream of chicken to crock pot
2. Add Chicken breasts and season them (I forgot this step and so I seasoned in step 4 YMMV)
3. Set on High for 5 hours
4. About a half hour before it is done add 1-2 slices of Swiss cheese on top of each breast.
5. Add stuffing on top spread evenly and then allow it to finish cooking for the remaining time.
6. When finished cooking place breast on a plate (or bowl) and then top with additional stuffing and sauce from the crock.

Alternately you could shred the chicken before adding the stuffing which would make it easier to eat.

* 2 1/2 lbs. boneless chuck roast
* 16 oz. orange juice
* 1 can (7 oz.) chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
* 1 tbsp. chili powder
* couple pinches of ground black pepper
* 2 tbsp. lime juice
* 1 tsp minced cilantro (I didn't use fresh - I'm lazy)
* 1 tsp minced garlic (still lazy)

Hunk of beef goes in the crockpot, then pour the orange juice and lime juice over it.  Throw all your spices, cilantro, and garlic on top of the beef.  Finally, pour your can of peppers over that meat.  

I cooked it on low for 3 hours, then switched to high for about 2 hours when dinner time got moved up!  I'm sure 8 hours on low will work just as well.  In the final 30 minutes, dump out all the liquid (or not, depending on how juicy you want it) and shred it up.  I shred it right in the crockpot.  Cook on low for another 30 minutes.  Try not to eat all of it in this last bit of time because it looks so delicious! 

I like these with corn tortillas, but flour tortillas or crunchy shells are good too.  I used monterey jack cheese, sour cream, iceberg lettuce, and tomato for my additions, but there are a lot of different variations I'd like to try in the future for these.

Ingredients

• Pork Roast
• Bananas
• Liquid Smoke
• Sea Salt
• Large heavy duty aluminum foil


Directions

1. Put pork onto large sheet of heavy duty aluminum foil. Leave plenty of room around the edges. 
2. Make 1/4"" to 1/2"" deep cuts into top of pork. 
3. Rub 3-4 TBS of sea salt into top of pork. 
4. Add 3-4 TBS of liquid smoke. 
5. Place 2-3 **unpeeled** bananas next to pork. 
6. Seal foil well and refrigerate overnight. 
7. Place whole package in crock pot on high for 8 hours. 
8. Unwrap pork and shred with two forks.

EDIT: For clarification, take the bananas out after cooking and throw away. They'll be black. Also take the foil out before shredding. I believe the foil is necessary because I once made this without tightly sealing the foil and the pork came out really dry.  "	t5_2s64w	True

I know it's not one of those dump-and-go slow cookers but it's still much easier than traditional cooking if you have a lot to do or are chasing kids around the house.

*  2 cloves garlic, minced

*  1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules

1352222802.0	12qldn	Great Healthy Recipe: about $12 for 3 days' worth of delicious food (5 qt Slowcooker or larger)	aryalissnin	101	13	15	"**Ingredients:**
* *Meat:* 2-6 Boneless, Skinless Chicken Breasts OR 1/2-2lb roast
* 1-5 medium russet potatoes, cut up into bite-size pieces
* 1/2 - 1 lb brussel sprouts (I like to cut these in half)
* 1-2 onions, cut into bitesize pieces (I use white but sweet/yellow work as well)
* 1-4 oz Huy Fong Sriracha (I like 2-3)
* 2 tbsp yellow curry powder
* your choice of herbs like thyme, etc.
* beef broth to taste (How soupy do you want the dish?)

**Basic:** Basically, just cut up the onions and potatoes into bitesize pieces and throw 'em in the pot. Then cut your brussel sprouts in half and add them. The chicken breasts can be added whole, as slowcooking them will make them so tender they crumble at the touch of a fork. Then add the broth, sauces, and spices. Use your bare hands (or comparable kitchen tool) to make sure the spices/sauces and broth get all over every chunk of food. Cook on high for 5-6 hrs, or low for 6-8.

**Optional:** If you plan ahead, you can marinate the chicken overnight in either the sauce/spice mixture above or one of your choosing. Also, the potatoes can be replaced with whatever you want if you're trying to stay low on carbs.

I am a ""poor college student"" with no real kitchen to speak of, and a need to spend less on food every week. I also love working out so I need healthy foods high in protein, carbs, and vitamins to fuel my muscles. With this recipe, I spend about 11.50(~$6 for chicken, ~$1 for potatoes, ~$1.50 for onions, ~$3 for brussel sprouts, ~$0.50 for broth) for 3 days worth of food. Sometimes, I kill it in two, but I'm a huge eater. It should last many people 3-4 days.

Hope that helps!

1. Preserved lemon chicken stew with onions 

In large slow-cooker: 

a. Pour a layer of olive oil that covers the bottom of the slow cooker 
b. Slice 3-4 white or yellow onions in large circles, layer on the oil 
c. Place chicken pieces (large, skin-on, bone-in if possible) on top of the onions. It's best if these have been marinating in lemon juice and olive oil, but not necessary. 
d. Throw in: powdered ginger (1 tsp), salt (1-2 tsp), garlic powder (1 tsp), turmeric (1 tsp), and black pepper (1-2 tsp). If you have fresh garlic and ginger, it's good to throw some in grated or chopped. If you have real saffron, a pinch is fantastic to add at this point, but it's not worth buying for this dish alone. 
e. If you have access to preserved lemons or have some you make around, rinse well, cut the rind of one lemon in strips, scoop out the pulp from 1/2 lemon, and add to stew. Preserved lemons throw in a bright sour note that is fantastic.  If not, add the zest and juice of 1 medium lemon 
f. If you have fresh parsley or cilantro, you can add them in the beginning as a bundle that you take out for serving or you can also chop finely and add 15 minutes at the end of cooking. 
f. Cover with water or chicken or veggie stock. Cook on low for 6-8 hours.  

Typically, this is a pressure cooker dish (the opposite from slow cooking!). Doing it in the slow cooker is certainly a bit different: the chicken tends to be more tender, and the onions form more of a sauce. If you want to use a pressure cooker, sautee 1/2 of the onions, garlic, spices, and chicken in olive oil until onions caramelize and chicken is browned. Throw in broth and the other 1/2 of the onions, and cook at pressure for 15-20 minutes or until onions are cooked and chicken is tender. 

As with many slow-cooked recipes, it's best to brown everything on a skillet first, but not necessary. It helps caramalize the onions and brown the chicken. 

Serve with bread to sop up the sauce, or if you want to be less traditional and more refined, rice or potatoes. You can also throw in some quartered peeled potatoes 1.5 hrs before serving if desired. 

Ingredients: 
- Chicken (any parts, preferably bone-in, skin-on) 

- 3+ white or yellow onions 

- Preserved lemons or 1-2 medium lemons

- Olive oil 

- Fresh garlic, ginger, cilantro, and parsley (optional) 

- Chicken or vegetable stock (optional) 

Powdered Spices: Salt, pepper, garlic, ginger, turmeric, saffron (optional)

Cut into 5 large pieces 

Browned in skillet on stove on all sides

Sprinkled just a little bit of sea salt, cumin, coriander on all sides.

Heavy coating of [""Bone Sucking Dry Rub""](http://www.amazon.com/Fords-Gourmet-Foods-Suckin-Purpose/dp/B003DSRCNE) brand on all sides. Patted in.

Place in bottom of empty slow-cooker, add 2 small half size (6oz I think) cans of A&amp;W root beer.

Cooked on low for 5 hours.

Removed, drained slow-cooker, shredded pork, placed back into slow-cooker and added bottle of BBQ (KC Masterpiece was all I had on hand but came out great). Mixed thoroughly to evenly distribute BBQ into pork.

Cook on low for additional 2 hours.

Served on toasted bread with a slice of cheese and it was AMAZING!

I've done pork butt in my slow cooker a number of times and while it's always been ""ok"" it's never been great until this time.

- 3/4 cup Italian salad dressing
- 1/3 cup brown sugar (NOTE: the receipe called for this, but I didn't have it, so I just added a squeeze more of the barbeque sauce)

I shredded the chicken at 5hrs in and let it sit in the sauce for the remaining time.  Served with potato rolls!  It was seriously yummy; I don't know if the brown sugar would have done anything to the sauce except maybe make it slightly richer but it was very good anyways!

1355092682.0	14ki2x	Mongolian Beef - Updated	adamb0mb	99	21	18	"Hello... I wasn't sure what the etiquette is, since I'm fairly new to this subreddit, but I've updated this recipe that I saw earlier:
http://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/14gmje/mongolian_beef/

First off, I switched the top round roast out for a bottom round roast. Overall, it's less fatty... but has a fat-cap that keeps everything moist while cooking (and is easy to remove later).
Instead of butchering it into 5 steaks, I left it whole. Then I salted and peppered the whole thing and browned all sides in a stainless steel pan.

**Ingredients**

* 1 Bottom Round Roast, ~3lbs
* 1 tsp vegetable oil
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp pepper
* 1-2 inches fresh ginger, grated
* 4 cloves garlic, minced (or pressed)
* 2 yellow onions, sliced (see note)
* 1 cup low sodium soy sauce
* 1 cup water
* 1/2 cup of brown sugar (or more, to taste)
* scallions
* Sesame oil (optional)

**Directions**

* Heat oil over medium heat in a skillet (stainless steel is good). Salt and pepper the roast, and then brown on all sides (approx 2 mins per side). Transfer to the roast to the crockpot, fat-cap up.
* In the skillet, saute ginger and garlic in the leftover oil. Once lightly browned, add soy sauce, water and brown sugar. Using a wooden spoon, make sure to scrape up any browned-bit from the pan. Stir until combined. Pour into crock pot.
* Quickly saute the onions in the saute pan until slightly softened/browned, about 2 minutes. If needed, use a little water to  deglaze the pan. Add the onions to the crock pot.
* Cook for 8 hours on low (4 hours on high). Remove beef and shred (should be extremely easy). Transfer the cooking liquid to a sauce or saute pan, and reduce until slightly thick, about 10 minutes. Return meat and cooking liquid back to crock for another 1-2 hours on low. Add scallions and sesame oil to taste. Serve over rice.

**Notes**

 * To slice the onions, cut the onion in half from ""pole to pole"". Clean it up (remove the skin, etc). Then make slices ""pole to pole"". Cutting it this direction helps the onions keep their shape during the long cooking process.

* **3** Pounds Boneless Skinless Chicken Breast
* **1** 12 ounce Bottle Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Wing Sauce
* **1/2** 12 ounce Bottle Original Frank's Red Hot Sauce
* **1**  8 Ounce Package Philadelphia Cream Cheese (I used the 1/3 less fat variety)
* **1**  4 ounce Container crumbled Blue Cheese

Throw everything in the slow cooker (expect Blue Cheese).  Cook on high for 5 hours.  Shred the chicken, and give it all a good stir.  Turn the slow cooker to low and cook for 1 more hour.  Turn off the slow cooker and mix in the package of Blue Cheese.

Unfortunately, he and I are on the wrong side of the family. There is zero communication. There can be no communication. Even if there was communication, he would never give me the recipe. 

I want this recipe so much. It couldn't have been anything extremely special. Here's what I know:

-They were homemade.

-They were made in a slow cooker. 

-They were small enough to eat with toothpicks. 

-They were savory but not spicy. 

-They were swimming in a brown gravy-like sauce.

I understand all slow cookers are different. 

When adding in dry ingredients (rice and beans) how much liquid should I add? Does the 1:2 rice to liquid ratio apply here? How long does it generally take, for them to soak and cook? 

What's the general rule of thumb on timing when making a stovetop recipe ready for the crockpot? 

How long should cooking take, at least, when a recipe includes raw meat?

http://imgur.com/a/cxRSb


2lbs pork shoulder

2 cups teriyaki sauce (I used Kikoman Garlic and Green Onion)

cornstarch + water optional


I just threw in the pork and coated it with the teriyaki sauce and set my cooker for low. I cooked for 9.5 hours since I didn't really have a choice but I think 8 is the optimal from what I've read. I pulled the meat out, removed the bones and fat, and shredded it with a fork. I then took the sauce in the crockpot and refrigerated it for a couple hours to try and make separating the fat out easier. After skimming off the fat, I simmered the sauce on the stove and added a little cornstarch + water to thicken it up into a nice glaze. I ended up only using about half the sauce and keeping the rest in my fridge.

I was kind of just trying it out and it worked pretty well! It tastes exactly as I thought it would, and varies depending on the sauce used I'm sure. Next time I think I would only use 1.5 cups of teriyaki since as I said I only used half the leftover sauce. The reason I don't say 1 cup is because I would be worried about the meat drying out in the cooker."	t5_2s64w	True

http://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/1a84xy/10_5qt_oval_digital_slow_cooker_in_stainless/

I bought one to replace a 3.5 quart cooker.  Last night I went through the first process (heat on high w water for 30 mins to clean it).  And about an hour ago I put in a 4lb roaster chicken with some seasoning and am letting it rip.  I will provide updates along the way.  This may be helpful for people to decide if this is a good value or not.  

Started on ""Low"" at 8:45am.  

9:30am - temperature of lid and stoneware pretty low after 45 minutes still.  Way cooler than my old crockpot.  Switch to high temperature.  

I will take pictures along the way and create an album later to share. Hope this will help people and I really hope it's a good cooker because $10 is such a bargain, IF it works well.  

Edit: 11:45am.  The Cooker has now been on for a total of three hours.  ""High"" is not as hot as my old crock pot (but that one would boil liquids on high).  I may be operating off of a false basis by means of comparison; possibly that cooker was TOO hot.  Regardless, I am leaving the new one on ""high.""  The outer shell gets quite hot but the stone ware isn't.  It seems like there is more room for the stoneware to wiggle around than my old cooker.  The food is taking a nice color now.  

Edit: 2:00pm.  I still have the cooker on high and the chicken is now cooking quite nicely.  There are lots of juices inside the pot.  There is a light boil to it.  The lid does not seem to fit quite as nicely as the lid on my old cooker, but that had an additional gasket on the lid.  While it was not tight, it seemed to promote more condensation.  I feel like high is between low and high on my old cookers.  

Edit: 3:30pm; DEFINITELY cooked; tried to turn with tongs and just shredded the poor bird.  Reduced heat to low and added 4 capfuls of lemon juice. 

Also worth mentioning is I am working at home today, there might be a bit of a ""watched pot never boils"" thing going on.  Obviously ifI am not home for the day I never see food ""half done"".

Pictures taken at 8:45am, 11:45am, 3:30pm(when tried to turn it) and about 5:45pm when I took it out.  Had to use tongs; bones were just falling out.  Nothing but chicken with about 1 teaspoon of oil and basil/blackpepper.

My concerns over its heating ability are quelled.  Good $10 buy.  

Some may say I should have made something more adventurous but for the first run out I wanted to try something very simple and basic so that I wasn't adding too many other factors in.

1355978255.0	155fwf	Since it's been requested a few times: Glögg Time!	TatonkaChief	90	23	28	"First off, what is Glögg, you ask? Glögg is very simply a winter drink - it's warm, spicy, and alcoholic to make sure you forget all about the winter blues. Spiced wine recipies come from all over the place - I was first introduced to it with Gluhwein from Germany. Glögg is essentially the same thing, but hailing from Sweden. It is very, very good.

I've gotten a few requests for a full write up of my Glögg recipe so here y'all go. Everything except the brandy can be found and WinCo too, so if you have one near you it's easy to pick up the all the supplies for really cheap. 

***Glögg Time!***

First, you need to get preppy - round up your **ingredients:**

- 1 or 2 bottles red wine (anything under $11)
- 1 bottle sherry or port (I suggest port - so sexy)
- 1 bottle brandy (anything over $11 - shitty brandy is shitty)
- 1 large orange
- 1 cup golden raisins
- 1 cup blanched silvered almonds
- 4 or 5 cinnamon sticks
~ 15 cardamom pods
- 5 cloves
~ 1/2 star anise
- brown sugar to taste (it can get wicked sweet, so be careful)
- Cheesecloth (unless you like playing *Old Man and the Sea* and want to fish out spices all night)

**Commandments:**


- **Step One:** Open all your liquids and pour them into your slow cooker (If you plan on driving afterwards use half the bottle of brandy - even then be careful, this shit can get potent). Save the bottles, as they work perfectly for storing extra glögg. 


- **Step Two:** Wrap the clove, cardamom, and anise in some cheesecloth and send them down to swim with the alcoholic fishes. Those cinnamon sticks? Throw 'em in too. Oh shit - don't forget the almonds and raisins - drown those fools (I put the almonds in cheesecloth too, because the raisin are fucking **delicious** afterwards and I like to eat them by the fistful without having to pick out almond slivers). Lastly, take that orange which is undoubtedly now sitting alone and scared and peel it. Save the orange for the morning when you need vitamins and electrolytes - for the glögg you only need the peel. Toss it in. 

- **Step Three:** cook on low heat for about 2-4 hours. Depending on the quality of the spices, the cook time will change so taste it often and remove the spices when it gets to your liking. If it needs sweetening, add brown sugar. 

- **Drink responsibly and have fun.** For every glass you drink yourself, pour two for friends!

(advanced drinkers: I've put little bits of dried ginger, juniper berries, and allspice berries [different times - not all together; that sounds gross] in with great success before. Experiment and be merry!)

It soldiered on through college and made some of the best pulled pork I've ever eaten. Then I went to use it after a mini-hiatus and it isn't getting up to temp. The meal we made last in it got both me and my boyfriend sick (and he has an iron stomach). So, I am afraid we need to say ""Adieu"" to my faithful, free, slowcooker.


Now my question is what do I do with the ceramic bowl/lid? Do I just toss them with the base? Can they still be useful? Could I, say, use it to slow cook in the oven? Or is it just too heavy/impractical for other uses?

Bonus-- I've tried looking for a recommended slowcooker thread and none of them looked that good. I want something that will last and is quality (I'm fine spending $150 so I don't have to buy multiple over years). The one I have currently is not made any more.

Get 12 pack of dinner rolls. Cut in half. Spread butter on that shit. Fry until brown then remove. Line baking sheet with them. Take pulled pork which has been refrigerated for a few hours and put in a pot with 8 oz water and 2 oz of Worcestershire sauce. Bring to light boil. Remove from heat and place pork in small amounts on each piece of bread. Cover with mozerella and broil for five minutes.

Im a 22 year old single guy with very limited cooking experience. My cooking skills besides summer bbq are usually grilled cheese, pancakes, pasta etc...the extreme basics. I recently picked up a crock pot since I've gotten my own place and been experimenting with success in pulled pork and chilli. 

Anyway enough rambling. This is the first ""different"" dish I've made in the crock pot and I absolutely loved it, and im kinda proud to be honest.

http://imgur.com/eWCalgn


**You'll need:**

* Tin Foil
* Tilapia
* Balsamic Vinegar
* Mandarin Oranges
* Honey
* Garlic Salt
* Basil
* Salt and Pepper


Get a slab of tin foil and place a frozen piece of Tilapia on it, Rub it down with brown sugar, coat it as you see fit.

Soak it in Balsamic Vinegar

Surround the fish with pieces of mandarin oranges, I chose to not use any juice, your call. 

A drizzle of honey, a dash of garlic salt, some basil, salt, pepper is what I used, im sure it could be improved on though!

Wrap that sucker up in tin foil place it in the crock pot, I cooked it on high for 2 and a half hours on high. It was more then cooked, in fact it was burning hot. However I could of left it in a bit longer, because the mandarin orange glaze that was left over from cooking was just warm. Not distracting warm, but it could of been a bit hotter is all. Also, wish I could of had some lemon juice kicking around..A touch of that might of been good. 

The dish was as sweet as you'd expect, not over powering by any means, but nice. If you have kids they might enjoy this."	t5_2s64w	True

If you know the source, please advise!

Edit: Source! It would seem that the recipe was taken straight (or slightly adapted) from this one: http://www.food.com/recipe/carne-rellenos-413807

**Carne Rellenos**

You'll need:

* 4oz (or one can) whole green chiles, drained and emptied
* 4oz cream cheese, softened
* 2lb flank steak
* 1.5 cups salsa verde

Slit open chiles on one side and stuff with cream cheese.

On a sheet of waxed paper, lay steak flat and score its surface. Turn over the steak. Lay stuffed chiles across unscored side of steak. Roll the whole thing up and tie with kitchen twine to secure.

Place the whole meat thing into your slow cooker and pour the salsa in. Cover and cook on low for 6-8 hours or high for 3-4 until done.

Remove steak when cooked and slice into 6-8 pieces. Serve with the sauce leftover in the cooker.

I had mine on rice pilaf, but serve it with what you would deem appropriate. Enjoy!

Sprinkle half of the onion and garlic powders on the pork shoulder and save the rest for later. Put the crock pot on low and cook for 8 hrs. At the 4 hour mark, turn shoulder over and sprinkle the rest of the onion and garlic powders onto the shoulder and let cook for the rest of the 8 hrs. When shoulder is cooked, take out of crock pot and start pulling the pork apart.

Essentially I layered the bottom of my crockpot with 1/4 inch slices of fresh pineapple to keep the meat off the direct heat.  Then I put my 3lb pork butt on top and poured root-beer half way up the meat. I sprinkled some rib rub on top and set that bad boy to low for 8 hours. 
After 6 hours I noticed the crockpot was at a good boil.... I decided the meat was probably good at that point and deemed my backup crock pot a pos for boiling. I poured off 90% of the root-beer and chopped up the pineapple. I shredded the pork and added the chopped pineapple and famous Dave's sweet and zesty sauce. Had this been just for me I would have added sweet baby rays sweet n' spicy, but my family doesn't like the heat. 

Since this was my first run I didn't do anything to fancy to serve it; however, next time I will make sliders with Hawaiian king rolls and top it with some sort of spicy coleslaw.

Report:

I'm new to the r/slowcooker community and this meal showed it, I'm sad to say. Epic fail. Fortunately, I'm the only one here! (FA + Epic Food Fail = winning?) 

Lessons learned:

Follow a recipe to insure success.
Plan a heating strategy and stick with it.
Next time, de-bone. (Legs have bits of bones and junk at the end that came lose in the stew.)
Don't just toss in a piece of cooked sausage without an exit strategy. (It turned into dirt-like clumps.)

To make myself feel better I fried up some panchetta and ate it with Beyer's chocolate. It was as good as it sounds.

1356503299.0	15ggl9	The ultimate (well, my favourite) Beef Stew recipe	lurkaholic	73	15	16	"I love making beef stews in the slow cooker, and this particular recipe has come out as probably the best one I've found (of the 6 or 7 that I've tried). It's from [Slow Cooker Revolution](http://www.amazon.ca/Americas-Test-Kitchen-Slowcooker-Revolution/dp/1933615699).

I think the core tricks here are frying up the onions and adding flour, cooking the veg in a foil packet separately from the main stew juice, and the secret ingredients- tomato paste and soy sauce.

**Ingredients:**

* 4 lbs chuck roast / stewing beef , cut into 1"" chunks
* 5 medium red potatos, cut into 1"" chunks
* 1 lb carrots, cut into 1"" chunks
* 3 onions, minced
* 6 garlic cloves, minced
* 2 cups frozen peas
* 0.25 cup tomato paste
* 1.5 cups beef broth
* 1.5 cups chicken broth
* 1 tablespoon dried minced thyme (or 2 tablespoons minced fresh)
* 1/3rd cup all purpose flour
* 1/3rd cup soy sauce
* 2 bay leaves
* Vegetable oil

**Cooking:**

1. Heat a couple tablespoons of oil until shimmering in a big pan. Add the onions, garlic, tomato paste and thyme, and fry until onions soften and start getting lightly browned, 8 - 10 minutes medium heat. Stir in the flour and cook for another 1 minute. Slowly whisk in the chicken broth, smoothing out any lumps and scraping up any brown bits from the pan (those are the super flavorful bits!). Transfer to the slow cooker.

2. Add the beef broth, bay leaves, and soy sauce to the slow cooker and stir together. Season the beef with a little salt and pepper, add to the slow cooker.

3. Combine the potatoes and carrots in a big bowl with a couple tablespoons of vegetable oil. Add salt and pepper and toss them around until it looks like they're all nicely mixed up. Place the resulting mixture in a large foil packet (e.g. place them on one side of a large piece of foil, fold it over and crimp to seal the edges) and lay it in the slow cooker, on top of everything else.

4. Cook for ~10 hours on low.

5. Transfer the foil packet to a plate and leave everything alone for 5 minutes. Once the stew has settled, skim the fat from the surface using a large spoon. Open the foil packet (watch for steam) and add the veg into the stew. Add the 2 cups of frozen peas, stir, and leave for 5 minutes to heat through.

6. Eat, eat, eat!

First time I made this it was a little more work than I was used to for a beef stew, but now I've tasted it I'm not going back to bachelor beef style. The veg really holds its flavor and texture a lot better, and the stew itself just tastes so incredibly beefy.

I have been cooking water in my crockpot to test the temperatures, and have found that:

* on high, the temperature went from 15C/59F to 80C/176F in about 80 minutes (before I switched to keep-warm; I'm sure it will go higher too, but i don't really care because it's too hot anyways)
* on keep warm, it stabilized on 75C/167F
* on low, it stabilized on 95C/203F

Considering that 165F is apparantly the safe temperature, I am considering trying:

1.  prepare meat and vegetables, completely thawed and ready in the fridge, with mostly bite size pieces
2. prepare stock
3. add ingredients and warm stock (lets say around 40C/104F) to pot
4. cook on high for an hour, until temperature reaches the safe temperature
5. switch to keep warm (the pot will still keep rising ~5C)
6. cook for 5-6 hours on a steady 75C/167F

I am trying to address the following concerns:

* no frozen ingredients
* no meat/fish left in room temperature
* smaller pieces reduce the time needed to reach safe internal temperature

The best meal I can make is the one I had in Ukraine when I was there 6 years ago. 

You can't really find a Ukrainian-style borscht recipe on the web, let alone for slow cookers, but you can modify the beet-rich borscht recipes to fit your needs. 

I've made this about 5 times, each with great success. The ingredients are easy to find, spare the dill, but most places should have it. You can cheat with the cabbage and just get the cabbage already cut for coleslaw (minus the carrot and onion).

I present to you: Ukrainian Borscht

1.	1 lb (500 g) extra-lean ground beef 
2.	2 onions, chopped 
3.	4 cloves garlic, minced 
4.	1 carrot, chopped 
5.	1 stalk celery, chopped 
6.	1/2 cup (125 mL) chopped fresh dill 
7.	1/4 tsp (1 mL) caraway seeds, crushed 
8.	1/4 tsp (1 mL) each salt and pepper 
9.	4 cups (1 L) thinly sliced cabbage 
10.	4 cups (1 L) beef stock 
11.	1 can (28 oz/796 mL) diced tomatoes 
12.	1/4 cup (50 mL) light sour cream 
13.	Dill sprigs


1 Combine the beef and all the chopped vegetables except the cabbage in your slow cooker. You're going to need a BIG oval one; if you have a smaller crock pot, you'll need to adjust the recipe accordingly.

2 Pour 2 cups of the beef broth over the vegetable/beef mix. If the vegetable/beef mix is not completely covered by the liquid, top off with the extra beef broth until they are.

3 Cover and cook on the low heat setting for 8 and 1/2 hours. You can cheat and use high heat for 4 hours if you're in a hurry, but don't expect it to be as good.

4 When the 8 and 1/2 hours are up, turn your cooker onto high heat and add the shredded cabbage. Cover again and cook on high for 30 minutes to an hour depending upon how soft you like your cabbage.

5 Ladle into a bowl and garnish with two tablespoons of sour cream."	t5_2s64w	True

1360465461.0	1887vh	Black Beans with Chipotles Adobos	Moonpile	68	14	18	"This group has inspired me to do a pulled pork which I'll be putting in before bed tonight, so I thought I'd give back with my most thoroughly tested crock pot recipe.  My wife loves these, and so do my kids.

* Black Beans, dry, 1 lb
* Chiles Chipotles Adobos, 7 oz can
* Onion, Yellow
* Garlic, 1 bulb
* Chicken Stock (or water)
* Cumin, powdered, 3 to 5 tablespoons, maybe more
* Black Pepper, ground, 1 or 2 tablespoons
* Italian Seasoning, 1 tablespoon

Soak the black beans for about 8 to 12 hours as usual.  Drain and thoroughly rinse.

I like to smear some bacon grease on my crock pot before putting anything in it.  Olive or other oils will do.

Chop the onion and peel, smash and mince the garlic.  Optionally sautee the onions and garlic.  If you do, you might want to throw the spices in towards the end.

Pull the chiles from the can.  Make sure to remove the cap and stem, and chop finely.  This might sound like it's too much spice but my 22 month old son tears into this stuff. Of course he has to live with me, so he might not be typical!  If you like it spicier you can either doctor it after the fact or put some more chiles of different kinds in there.

Put all the ingredients in the crock and fill with chicken broth and/or water to just cover the beans.  Get all the sauce out of the can by swirling some of your water or stock in there.  You know you want it! My smaller crockpot is a Rival 5.5 qt oval one and it fits this recipe just perfectly.

Cook on high for 6 to 8 hours, stirring a few times.  I'm not sure about Phytohaemagglutinin in black beans, but I've never had a problem with it, possibly because my cooker gets it into a solid simmer by about half way through.  If you have any concerns, boil the beans for 10 minutes in a regular pot before putting them in your crock.

Serve in lots of different ways: sides to other Mexican fare, over rice, or in a burrito with rice, cheese, etc.  I like putting them in an omelette the next morning and topping it with cheese, sour cream and salsa.

Thanks for all the inspiration!"	t5_2s64w	True

* [Chicken and Sausage gumbo basic recipe](http://www.food.com/recipe/louisiana-chicken-and-sausage-gumbo-the-real-stuff-47656)
* [Gumbo Base \(roux\) recipe](http://www.food.com/recipe/gumbo-base-aka-roux-47651)

I did a few things differently than what the recipe calls for. 

* I used boneless skinless chicken breasts.  I browned these after coating them in a seasoned flour before making my roux. 

* The roux was made in a LARGE cast iron skillet with the browned chicken goodness in the bottom still. I use a 1:1 (oil to flour) ratio for my roux and I've always made it with peanut oil. I usually end up adding a bit more flour than oil in the roux base depending on how it cooks. 

* **I follow the recipe up to step 6** and then throw the roux (browned flour/oil mixture and celery, onions, garlic and peppers) into the crockpot. At that point I begin slowly adding my chicken broth and stir it all in bit by bit. Don't add it in too fast or the roux will break. 

* Once you've got enough broth in there that you can easily stir the roux around (think cake batter consistency or a little more ""wet"") add in your sliced up browned chicken and the smoked sausage pieces and let it slow cook for at least 4 hours on low. Season with Tony Chacherie's cajun seasoning. Most grocery stores carry it but you can also find it online.  I also add in cayenne pepper since we like our gumbo spicy.

* Every 45 minutes to an hour check on it. Ladle off any oil that comes to the top. Give it a good stir to make sure nothing is burning on the bottom and put the lid back on.  If it seems like it needs more liquid add in a little bit of chicken broth.

* I've used both a 5 qt round crockpot and a 7 qt oval crockpot. For the 7qt I usually double the recipe size. 

I've made this gumbo well over a dozen times now and it gets better every time I make it. Serve it with crusty French Bread, white rice and File' and you'll have a really awesome dinner. 

It is worth the time to make the roux. That typically takes me about 45 minutes to do a roux for a 7 qt. crockpot (1.5 cup of oil and about 2 cups of flour whisked in slowly). "	t5_2s64w	True
1346527917.0	z72x3	Can we list the size of slow cooker used in each recipe?	CarlFriedrichGauss	69	14	12	"I'm very new to slow cooking (and just cooking in general) and I can't really tell just by reading a recipe how much space things will take up in the slow cooker. I've already had two recipes from other sites overflow on me because I couldn't figure out what size slow cooker was being used. I now know enough to guess that most of the time it's a 6qt slow cooker and also I shouldn't be filling up my 3qt more than 3/4 of the way, but it's still hard for me to tell how much space everything is going to take up until after I dump all of the ingredients in. It's quite a bit more helpful to newbies to list the size of the slow cooker you used in your recipe so that we can tell how much groceries to buy and how many servings we can get out of it.

1337108881.0	tomqk	Just my two cents, regarding slow-cooker pulled pork recipes.	groglisterine	63	7	19	"A whole bunch of people tend to drain their crock after slow-cooking their meat. The juice that is drained is normally cider, root beer or just stock, but one way or the other, that's a whole butt-load of wasted flavour. Much better, is to pour those juices into a pot and reduce that shit! By turning the heat way up on a pan of juices, you 'reduce' the juices to an extra concentrated flavour without the masses of liquid, because all the water evaporates, and the concentrated flavours are left behind.

This works with cider, root beer, or just fat-n'-water, and you lose a lot less flavour this way.

So once your meat has cooked in its own juices - don't throw that stuff down the drain! Cook it down! Add flour if you want it to be extra gravy-like, but **don't throw it away!** Just reduce it down. You won't regret it."	t5_2s64w	True

Put into the pot, in order:

  - 2 cans black beans
  - 2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs
  - 1 large jar salsa
  - 2 cans diced chilis

Cook on low for about 6 hours. Then add:

  - 2 cups brown rice
  - 1 cup corn

And stir them in (the chicken should break up a bit when you do this). Cook for another 90 minutes. The rice should both soak up the excess moisture (leaving something that's not drippy) and cook completely.

Then take some large (flour) tortillas, spoon the filling in, and fold the tortilla around it like a burrito. Eat immediately (yum), or wrap in tin foil to freeze (creating a Strategic Burrito Reserve).

**Notes**: The rice can be tricky, as the amount of water in your pot varies from salsa to salsa. If it looks like the rice has soaked everything up, but it's still grainy, add some water, stir, and cook for another half hour.

**Substitutions**: This works with a number of meats, but I like the flavor and texture of chicken thighs. Dry beans can be used if thoroughly soaked beforehand -- you may want to add some cooking time if you go this route. White rice works fine, though you need to let it cook for less time, and you may need to use more to catch all the moisture. Feel free to add hot sauce or more peppers to taste. I haven't had much luck using corn tortillas (they don't fold as well as flour, at least as far as I've managed), but YMMV."	t5_2s64w	True

* 1 large onion chopped
* 2 cloves garlic crushed
* 2 tsp paprika
* salt and pepper to taste
* 2 bay leaves (optional)
* 2 marrow bones (optional)

Soak beans and barley overnight. If you don't have time for that, boil the beans like normal and blanch the barley. saute onions and garlic in a skillet. add meat and brown on all sides. add beans and stir continuously until they start to shrivel (yes, seems weird but does wonders with the final texture!). put in a slow cooker with all the other ingredients. cover with water and cook for at least 12 hours but ideally around 24 hours.

After a friend on here raved about his slow cooker, and how he made 9 meals for $20, I went out and bought one. After reading 20-30 recipes and getting recommendations from friends, I couldn't make up my mind of what to make first.    

So I went to the grocery store and just winged it.   

Ingredients:  
2 lbs of boneless, skinless chicken  
1 can of chick peas  
1 can of green peas  
1 banana pepper  
1 red belle pepper  
1 medium sized onion  
1 big spoon of garlic  
a bunch of cayanne pepper  
red pepper flakes  
black pepper  
salt    

It turned out better than I expected.    

I've barely researched slowcooking at all, but from what I gather, you need:  
a couple pounds of some protein/meat  
chopped veggies  
some kind of watery base, so it doesn't burn  
lots of spices, so it's not bland    

My biggest question is related to giving meals a soupy-ness. Some threads, people just buy an actual can of soup and pour it in there. Sometimes its barbecue sauce. I used beans. If there isn't anything liquidy in it, will it burn? What are some other options?

I've been a lurker on this sub for a while but now I'm in need of some help. Our kitchen is getting refurbished, this starts on Wednesday. I'm going to be without a proper working kitchen for about 3 weeks. They will leave us with temporary cooking facilities, but it's nothing great! So, I'm thinking that my slow cooker will be getting a pretty good workout, what better time to try some new recipes!?!

The slow cooker usually gets used once or twice a week. I usually make all my stews/casseroles, chilli, pulled pork, bolognese in it, but, I know I can do much more in it so I'm taking this time without a proper kitchen to broaden my horizons! 

So, I'm after your best, family friendly slow cooker recipes please! There's myself, my husband, our 6 year old and our 2 year old. We'll all basically try anything once so aren't particularly fussy.

Thank you! :)"	t5_2s64w	True

**I used:**
4 frozen boneless, skinless chicken thighs

Most of a small bag of baby carrots

3 cubes of frozen minced garlic

1/2 cup of ketchup

Just under 1/2 cup of honey

1/2 cup of teriyaki sauce

some herbs de provence

1 teaspoon of dried basil

a squirt of dijon mustard

a splash of rum

A squeeze of lemon juice

I put the frozen chicken in at the bottom, the carrots on top of that, and mixed all the other ingredients separately in a small bowl. I poured the resulting sauce over the chicken and carrots. I left it in the crock for 4 hours on high. I think we have a 5-qt crock pot. 

Result: completely delicious, particularly the carrots. I will definitely be making this again. I think the mustard &amp; lemon juice gave a nice edge against the sweetness of everything else. Ginger might also be good. 

My boyfriend made the rice and it, also, was good. The other veggies are just frozen veggies from a bag.

1368197920.0	1e2kz7	Beef and Potato Curry	kier00	57	9	17	"**Ingredients:**

- 2-3 lb of stew beef
- 1 can beef broth
- 1-2 potatoes
- 2-3 jalapenos
- 3-5 cloves of garlic
- sea salt
- 2-4 tablespoons of curry
- 1-2 tablespoons of Cajun spice mix
- 1 onion

**Preparation:**

- Cut onion and use it to line the crock
- Cube potatoes.  I mean small cubes, large ones don't taste as good.  Put on top of onion
- Cut jalapenos.  Put on top of potatoes.
- Mince garlic.  Put on top of jalapenos.
- Spices/salt on top of jalapenos.
- Pour beef broth to make sure the spices mix nicely.
- Put cubed stew beef in crock.
- **cook 8 - 9 hours on low**

**Optional steps:**

- Brown beef in olive oil.
- After browning beef, you can use the leftover oil to quickly brown the potatoes and jalapenos.

Serves 1.  You aren't going to share.  I suggest eating with pita bread.

**Edit:** When it is done cooking you will have a lot of fluid (the broth and rendered beef fat).  You have two options:  strain and serve, or keep the juices.  If you are planning on storing, I suggest tasting it when it is out of the crock.  If it is to your taste, strain.  If you want it spicier, store it in the juices.  If you plan on serving over rice, keep the juices, the juices fuse with the rice and is extremely tasty."	t5_2s64w	True

1359465629.0	17hsif	Newbie here making Carnitas	notjadedyet	56	8	14	"So my recipe is:

2-3 Lbs Pork Butt, extra fat removed

8 Cloves of garlic

1 Bunch cilantro

1 Jalapeno

1 12 oz can Lager beer


My first question is that the recipe says to remove that fat. It's from  a cook book that's aiming at healthy slow cooking meals, but to me it seems like if I remove the fat from the pork butt, it's going to get dry and not as delicious. Is there a reason why I want to do that aside from making the meal less fatty? If I do keep it on there should that be on the bottom in my slow cooker or flipped so the fat is at the top?

Also, if anyone has any advice on how to interesting this up a bit I'd love to hear that. It just seems kinda boring to me right now. Thanks in advance!

We made the recipe tonight, my wife was the one that put it all together. I warned her about the honey and to cut it down to 1/2 cup instead of 1 cup, she forgot and used 1 cup. She also used 2 chicken breasts instead of 4, which worked out because it would have been way too much chicken. We served it with steamed broccoli and white rice. 

* Way too sweet definitely cut the honey in half

* The chicken was delicious and moist

* We both think if you add some orange zest to the mix it should give it a nice citrus flavor. 

* Our kids loved the chicken

* [PICS](http://imgur.com/a/8pqr4)

We plan on making it again with a few adjustments like, orange zest, more garlic and less honey. I felt bad that someone here had to throw away their dinner because it smelled awful. Since I cross posted it I felt obliged to make it and report back. "	t5_2s64w	True

We popped it into the slow cooker, poured a third of a bottle of BBQ sauce in, and set it on low for 8 hours.  Got home about 10 hours later where it was sitting on warm -- great.  It pulls apart easily enough, but the meat is DRY.  It's not dry like the Sahara, but it's not a nice juicy, fall off the bone moist -- probably because it sweated out about a quart or two of juice while cooking.  What am I supposed to be doing so it retains all those juices instead of coming out?  Thanks!

Edit:  Thank you to everyone who responded!  Basically, the consensus seems to be to chuck Dr. Pepper and apple cider vinegar in, cook fat side up, and buy shoulder meat instead of loin :)  Thanks again everyone -- I don't think my husband would let me try again with 5 lbs of meat (that we would then have to eat miserably for the next few days) without a significant game changer.

I turned it off and asked her to put it in the fridge when it cooled off in an hour or so. Well, she fell asleep and left it sitting out on the counter, and I just got home from work &amp; found it. 

It was sitting out without heat for about 7 hours, with the lid on. I'd hate to throw it out, as we had only eaten 2 sandwiches out of the 4 pounds or so. Is it unsafe to eat?


Edit: Looks like it's a pretty split decision. 

I've done this with some things in the past with no problems that I remember, but I think I'm gonna toss it this time. Our kitchen was pretty damn dirty to be honest and I think I used a fork of questionable origin to scoop out the meat for my sandwich right before I turned it off. 

I feel like I would be fine, but I just started my 5 day weekend &amp; I'll probably be heading to SXSW at least once in the next few days so yeah, $20 isn't worth it this time. And It wasn't the best pulled pork I've made anyway (used beer this time, I think it was better with soda.)

Here's a recipe for chicken tortilla soup. It's healthy if you manage the toppings!

• 2 lbs fresh boneless chicken breast
• 1 can black beans drained and rinsed
• 1 can pinto beans drained and rinsed
• 1 can rotel tomatoes (Mexican w/ cilantro is best)
• 1 can petite diced tomatoes 
• 1 lb bag of frozen corn
• 3 cups low sodium chicken stock or 3 cups water and a Knorr boullion cube (that's what I use)
• 1 tsp each: cumin and pepper
For serving: tortilla chips, Colby jack shredded cheese, sour cream and lime

Place chicken in bottom. Layer in all solids ingredients. Mix spices into broth and pour in top. Cook on low 7 hours. Chicken will shred easily using two forks.

*1 Kielbasa ($2)

*1.5 quarts of hot water

**UPDATE:**

Ok folks, I went to Trader Joe's and then Whole foods this AM (TJ's had everything but the beets), and I chopped it up and it's in the crock pot as I type this.

I decided to use this recipe: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/slow-cooker-borscht/ It's not too different than what was recommended, has a lot more seasoning though.

I followed the recipie almost exactly. Differences being that I put in 1/2lbs more meat*, I used a lot more beef broth than the 2 cups called for because the liquid in the recipe didn't nearly cover it, and I used fresh parsley and dill instead of dried.

Anyway, check it: https://www.dropbox.com/s/nfcfegri3hnt4a1/2012-12-06_12-59-18_880.jpg
I'll post another pic after it's done later tonight or tomorrow morning, and you can be all envious of me. Or something.


*For some reason TJ's only sells 1.5lbs packages of beef stew meat, and I thought about freezing the excess, but then I was like ""I like meat! I will put more of it in my stew!"" So I did.


**UPDATE #2**

Hey kids, I'm chewing the soup as I type this.  It came out very flavorful, very beefy, which obviously has to do with using 50% more beef than was called for and a lot more beef broth.  But it's pretty yummy.  If I ever make it again I'll cut things a bit differently as this time I just did the beef and potatoes in cubes.  

Anyway, thanks again for the input here it is:  https://www.dropbox.com/s/fevridp5xfxw8uk/2012-12-06%2020.52.29.jpg"	t5_2s64w	True
1352263559.0	12rz0z	Rescued a severely abused steak!	FloorManager	50	8	3	"Last night my wife made us a steak and used the juices to make a gravy. Normally that would rock but she got distracted during the process and ended up transforming the poor steak into leather. I decided to Lazarus that biznatch today though, with great results!

I took the steak leather, which was a pretty good size, and split it into 3 chunks. They were at the bottom of the cooker, next I poured the gravy over (which was mainly just the juice and flour). I picked up some oxtail, which I seared in a pan on the bone sides. One big vertebrae and three smaller tail pieces. I deglazed the pan with beef broth, and into the pot. Next came Cholula's hot garlic sauce, Worcestershire sauce, about a teaspoon of thai fish sauce, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and some nutmeg (beef loves nutmeg). For veggies I chopped a big russet potato, about 12 baby carrots, and two shallots. I feel that shallots hold up better in the slow cooker than onions. To finish I put two quarters of a small apple and 2 bay leaves at the top, to be removed later. Filled with beef broth and left it on the low setting for 7.5 hours.

The results are amazing. I fished the meat out (after eating the apple and discarding the bay leaves) to remove the bones and the larger gristle bits. The leather steak just fell apart in my fingers, and oxtail is the most decadent part of the cow in my opinion. Served with cous cous :)"	t5_2s64w	True

1366895670.0	1d2wjf	I think I left the lid off?	pumpkindog	48	7	8	"I'm making some enchilada meat today with ground beef, enchilada sauce, diced chilies and jalapenos, and taco seasoning.

I was late this morning and just dumped everything in and now I'm having one of those moments where I'm not sure I put the lid on or not.

I'm wondering how bad it will be if the lid is off all day (set on low, I put it in around 7:15 and won't be home 'til after 5) and if I need to run home during lunch just to check.

I'd rather not, it really burns my lunch hour...  but if it's necessary to save my enchilada meat then I guess I will.

**UPDATE**: I went home during lunch and I had left the lid on...  guess I should just better learn to trust past pumpkindog.

from extra research I think rather than drying out and burning it was more in danger of just being undercooked/full of bacteria.

stay savvy, slowcookers

Here is the recipe, taken from Allrecipes.com

Slow-Cooked German Short Ribs

2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

1 teaspoon salt

1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper

3 pounds beef short ribs

2 tablespoons olive oil

1 large onion, sliced

1/2 cup dry red wine

1/2 cup ~~chile sauce~~ tomato sauce

*1/4 cup Sriracha sauce

3 tablespoons packed brown sugar

3 tablespoons vinegar

1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce

*1 tablespoon honey

1/2 teaspoon dry mustard

~~1/2 teaspoon chili powder~~

2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

1/4 cup water


DIRECTIONS:

1. In a small bowl, combine 2 tablespoons flour, salt, and pepper. Coat the short ribs with the flour mixture. [I used a bag.]

2. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Brown short ribs in olive oil.

3. In a slow cooker, combine onions, wine, chili sauce, brown sugar, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, and chili powder. Mix thoroughly. Transfer the short ribs from the skillet to the slow cooker.

4. Cover, and cook on Low for 6 to 8 hours.

5. Remove ribs, and turn the slow cooker control to High. Mix the remaining 2 tablespoons of flour with 1/4 cup water, and stir into the sauce. Cook for 10 minutes, or until slightly thickened.

[Note: I plan on making this in my dutch oven at 325 for about 3 hours.]


[Edited for: After getting everything in the pot. An asterisk (*) denotes something I added to the original recipe]

Let me first say I did not know I was essentially making bar-b-q sauce. I had never made a homemade recipe for it and didn't realize that is what this was. That said, let me tell you this is the best sauce I've ever had. I would happily use this even as a dipping sauce. I wound up using 1/4 cup of Sriracha added to 1/2 C of straight tomato sauce. Then I added the rest of the dry and wet ingredients sans wine. I also added one healthy tbsp of honey and left out entirely the chili powder which was not needed.

After browning 3.6 pounds of boneless short ribs and removing from pot, I deglazed the dutch oven first with the onions and then added the wine. I then stirred in the sauce and added the meat. I then stirred all of the meat to coat well with onions and sauce. I just put it in a 325 degree oven and will update in about 3 - 3.5 hours. 

Edit 2: It turned out very well. I would have include pictures but the meat was pretty dark and there was no real way to take a shot that looked attractive (though it tasted awesome!) 

The red wine altered the taste of the sauce so that it wasn't really a bar-b-q sauce per se. The flavor was very good indeed. I don't think I will make short ribs again because they are so fatty though I will use this sauce on chicken and other lean meats. Thanks everyone for the suggestions and help!

That being said, I took a recipe for chili and adapted it to my style. 

I took .5lbs each of dry Kindey, Pinto, and Great Northern beans. Put them in slowcooker with about 8-9 cups of boiling water. Turn it to high for 1 hour, then low overnight. In the morning drain the water and turn off slowcooker. Choose your meat, I opted for stew beef chunks. Slighty borwn meat with 1 chopped up onion, and a few cloves of garlic, s+p. Add this to the beans in the slowcooker. Also add fresh tomatoes or two cans (small or large) of crushed tomatoes, jalapenos (if you like spice), 2-3 tbls of chili powder, ground cumin, cayenne pepper (use less if you don't like spice). I added roughly chopped cerley to mine. Cook on low for 8-9 hours. Be careful not to dry out your meat. I ate mine over some homemade spicy cornbread that was an excellent recipe. Both of these items were a huge hit with the man and two lady friends.

Recently I made beef bourguignon, slow cooker style. First of all I seared all the chunks of beef in a frying pan, then put them in the slow cooker with all other ingredients etc. They were sitting for about 10-15 minutes before they went in the cooker, not sure if that makes a difference?

Anyway after the cooking period on low for about 6 hours I think, the beef was still pretty solid, not that sweet falling apart feel we hope for! So where might I have gone wrong? I feel it could be any of these:

* Too much frying
* Too long sitting
* Not enough time in the slow cooker

BBQ sauce, garlic, carrots.  Bingo.

So what can't I do?

What problems have my fellow slowcookers run into in terms of ingredients?  I didn't think chicken would be good, because it would dry out, but on the front page the are dozens of recipes for chicken breast.

So the next time I tried it, I just put it in when I had an hour left to go on the soup. It wasn't done after 1 hour, not after 2, and I can't remember how long I kept extending it after that until it was finally done but it took forever and I ate really late.

So when's the right time to add rice to a crock pot of soup on low so that it gets cooked but not overcooked? T-minus how many hours?

I promise you it's fabulous, though - and perfect for the encroaching cold weather. 

**You will need:**

A slow cooker with a good 6l capacity or a similarly big cast iron dutch oven. You could also get away with a big casserole and do it in the oven. 

A big heavy skillet. 

A plate

Tongs, or the ninja-like ability to wield two forks in the manner of chopsticks.

**Ingredients:**

Oxtail. I usually make it with about 1kg worth, which should set you back about a fiver.

3 medium onions, peeled and chopped roughly

3 large carrots, likewise

3 sticks celery, chopped

You can also add in half a turnip or a couple of parsnips for a bit of sweetness if that's your thing

A bottle of dark, malty ale. I like to use Old Peculier.

1 pint of good quality dark beef stock. I make my own because beef bones are cheap. Use one you like but NO TOMATO. 

1tsp anchovy essence. Nam Pla will work just fine. 

2 bay leaves

A handful of whole black peppercorns, bashed a little in a mortar. You want big chunks, not a grind. Having a few whole ones in there is fine. 

2 tsp dried sage

Flour

Sea salt to taste

**Directions**

First, coat your oxtail chunks in seasoned flour, then brown them on all sides in the skillet. Arrange a later of veg in the bottom of your pot, then the meat, then your black peppercorns, sage and a bit of salt, and finally the rest of the veg. Tuck the bay leaves in there somewhere. Then pour in the bottle of beer, the anchovy essence and the stock. 

If you're using a slow cooker, set to high for a couple of hours, then low for 6-8 hours. If A dutch oven, bring to the boil, then reduce to a low simmer, put the lid on and leave for five hours, popping back now and then to give it all a poke and check nothing is sticking and burning. If it is, it's too hot. Long and low is the thing. You could also do this in a casserole in the oven, covered at 150C or so for five or six hours, topping up the liquid as necessary. 


You now have a big pot of unctuous goo. Note: this is not diet food. You can, if you like, spend the first hour of cooking skimming fat and scum off the top but tbh I think it's better if you don't. You could also cool it and lift off the solid fat after. Your choice. 

Anyway, you can if you like fish the now very mushy vegetables out and have pure beefy paradise, or you can leave them in. I quite like them. Fish the bay leaves out. I like to knock up some fresh sage and onion dumplings to eat with it. Whilst you can eat it as soon as it's done, I like to leave it out overnight and reheat the next day for maximum flavour. 

-----------------------------------
**Chilli**

If you want to turn this into chilli, fish the veg out. It has no place here. Likewise the bones, which are big and should just fall out of the meat. I am not going to pretend that what I make is authentic, but it is delicious. 

**You'll need:**

A big pot. The dutch oven you used to make the stew in will do nicely. It's cast iron or bust here, I'm afraid. Give it a wash first. 

The stew above, or whatever is left of it. Adjust the below quantities a bit if you have less than the whole thing. 

**Ingredients**

A large red onion, diced finely.

4 fat cloves of garlic, smashed and diced.

Rendered fat from smoked bacon. A tablespoon or so. Get the most heavily smoked (NOT SMOKED FLAVOURED) bacon you can - it's the flavour we want here. 

One large red bell pepper, finely diced

Dried kidney beans, soaked overnight and then simmered for two hours in salted water. You can use canned if you really want. A couple of handfuls of dried is about right for 1kg of oxtail. If you want to go for Texan* authenticity, skip them. 

(*I have no idea if this statement is correct. I am as English as tea and crumpets so it's all a bit of a mystery. Beans are lovely though)


3tsp cumin seeds

2tsp coriander seeds

1/2 star anise

3 or 4 whole cloves

Toast the spices then grind them. 

Three whole dried chipotle chillies. Unless you can get Ñora or Guajillo. 

A couple of dried ancho chillies

Dried Cascabels or some other hot mexican chilli, to taste. I sometimes use a wee bit of naga jolokia because I am well hard. 

Toast the above in a pan for a minute or so, then pop into your mortar and grind to small bits. 

1tsp of dried oregano.

1.5 tsp very finely ground espresso beans. 

2 tsp grated dark chocolate, the highest cocoa content you can find

1 can of crushed tomatoes. You could use two cans if you like it a bit more saucy and tomatoey.  

A shot of tequila, vodka or bourbon. 

**Directions**

Okay, that was more complicated than I thought it would be. I tend to cook by throwing stuff in until it smells/tastes right, so writing things down is a bit arduous.
 
What you do now is sauté the onions in the bacon fat for a few minutes until they are slightly transparent and starting to turn gold. Add the garlic and continue for another couple of minutes. Add the spices and keep going until you can smell the flavours being released. Then add the chillies for another minute or two. Then the bell peppers. Few more minutes. Then the coffee and chocolate, a minute or so. Tequila! Stir it in well and let it cook off. Add your kidney beans, oxtail and tomatoes. Give it all a good stir, then leave it to simmer for a couple of hours (the longer, again, the better), keeping an eye on the liquid. When it's all done, add a little salt if it seems necessary. 

Serve however you damn well please. A squeeze of lime and a bottle of cusqueña are always good.

It's as if slow cooking for many hours makes all the ingredients combine together and not in a good way, just sort of sucks all the savory out of the chicken and vegetables and/or whatever else is in there, and it's just not all that exciting.

I'm trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong. I'm using fresh ingredients. Is this just the nature of slow cooking? --I find that hard to believe given the popularity. Am I cooking things too long? --I've tried cooking for less time but so far haven't had any better success. Is it the spices I'm using--should I be putting them in later in the cooking cycle so they don't get all sapped out in flavor? --Maybe, but that sort of defeats the purpose of a slow cooker, with the food ready for you when you get home from work.

1375487767.0	1jlj7y	Modified version of Dafina/Cholent: amazing	koryisma	45	10	15	"I'm sorry-- I didn't think to take a picture. 

Inspired by [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/1j8oc0/cholent_the_original_slow_cooker_dish/), I set off to try Cholent and happened upon a recipe for a version of cholent from Morocco called Dafina. 

I based my dafina off of [this recipe](http://therecipelesscook.blogspot.com/2011/03/skhina-aka-dafina-morroccan-sabbath.html), with some modifications with what I had in the house. Unfortunately, my large slow cooker broke, so I used a dutch oven at 250 degrees for 12 hours, but you can certainly do it in a large slow cooker-- just modify amounts so that they fit! This is incredibly flexible... 

My variation: 

1. Pour a thin coating of olive oil at the bottom of the cooker/dutch oven- enough to coat the bottom. 

2. Add two medium onions roughly chopped on top of the oil 

3. Add about a cup of soaked but uncooked Great Northern Beans, though chickpeas would probably be better 

4. Add meat of choice: I used a large chicken breast cut in half, but that was because I didn't have any beef in the house. 

5. Add 3-4 whole peeled potatoes and/or sweet potatoes (I had white potatoes but wish I had sweet potatoes around: I could tell that the flavor would lend itself well!) 

4. Add 2-3 whole carrots cut in half or a handful of baby carrots 

5. Tuck 4-6 whole eggs in-shell around the pot/slow cooker (you see why I went with a dutch oven instead of a cooker-- it's a lot of food!) 

6. In a separate bowl, mix a cup of rice (or barley, brown rice, etc), a beaten egg, pinch of salt, pepper, nutmeg, cinnamon, and ginger together. Pour this onto a piece of aluminum foil or something similar. Pinch the edges together to create a pouch, and poke small holes in it with a knife or fork. Tuck this rice dumpling packet into the slow cooker or dutch oven.  You can make several of these if they fit, or omit the egg for a flavorful rice to serve with the dafina. 

7. Fill the cooking vessel with broth (of whatever meat you are using) until everything is covered. Throw in some bones if you have them. Add liberal amounts of paprika, ginger, garlic, salt, pepper, coriander seed, and cumin. I'd say at least 1/2 tsp of each if not more. 

8. Cook on low heat for 10-12 hours. 

Serve! Take the eggs out first and let them cool a bit. Open the rice packet and empty onto plates. Traditionally, the meat, vegetables, rice, eggs, and meat are served on the plate separately, but serve however you'd like. 

Even with the modifications, this was amazing. The slow-cooked eggs really took on the brown color of the broth-- like a tea egg!-- and they were slightly soft and creamy with a really unique flavor. Delicious. 

The chicken was flavorful and tender. The potatoes were an interesting texture because of the slow cooking and the fact that they were kept whole: soft on the outside and more like a baked potato on the inside. 

I made one rice dumpling and one packet of rice in the dafina-- I preferred the texture of the rice, and enjoyed that I had only put the cinnamon and nutmeg in the rice, not the stew itself. It provided a hint of different flavors when the rest of the dish was so similar. 

The liquid reduced to a gravy with no problem, though I did end up taking off the lid for the last hour or so to help with the reduction. 

All in all, I am very glad to have tried this. It was easy, it lent itself well to what I had in the house, and the flavors were pretty awesome. I also really enjoyed reading about the history of the dish. It's a traditional Jewish sabbath food, where people would make the stew the night before, and let it sit in the oven or slow cooker overnight so that it would be ready for lunch the next day without having to cook and break the sabbath! One website I looked at said that Cholent was actually the recipe that slow cookers were originally designed for! 

Enjoy!

I guess nothing bad can really happen from putting them in at the same time, the smaller one will just get more tender/juicy?

In terms of the cooking, do I just put the gammon is by itself, or do I need to cover it with water or whatever else? And should I smear the honey over it at the very start or a certain amount of time before serving?

Just got a slow cooker this week and I primarily use it to cook during the day while I'm at work. I don't have much time in the morning to do prep, so the recipe either needs to be simple (everything I've done so far), or some prep needs to be done the night before. 

I want to make a pretty standard meat and tomato pasta sauce, with onions and mushrooms. No time to cook the meat, onions, and mushrooms in the morning. What's my best option? 

1) Cook them the night before, store them dry in the fridge overnight, then add everything else to the pot in the morning
2) Cook them the night before, add everything else to the pot, put it in the fridge overnight, cook in morning
3) Something else

I don't remember where I found the original recipe online but here's my version of it.   
 Original text for those who are interested, with **my changes in bold**:

Ingredients:

* 1 cup butter or margarine
* 2 cups chopped onion
* 2 cups chopped celery
* 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley  (**used about 1 tbsp of dried instead**)
* 12 ounces sliced mushrooms   (**left these out**)
* 12 cups dry bread cubes   (**used cubed loaves of fresh white bread, crust on**)
* 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
* 1 1/2 teaspoons dried sage
* 1 teaspoon dried thyme
* 1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram  (**I think I would leave this out the next time I made it**)
* 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
* 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
* 4 1/2 cups chicken broth, or as needed   (**only used 1 cup, since the bread was already fresh/moist**)
* 2 eggs, beaten
 
	
Directions:  (I used a 5 quart slow cooker)

* Melt butter or margarine in a skillet over medium heat. Cook onion, celery, mushroom, and parsley in butter, stirring frequently.

* Spoon cooked vegetables over bread cubes in a very large mixing bowl. Season with poultry seasoning, sage, thyme, marjoram, and salt and pepper. Pour in enough broth to moisten, and mix in eggs. Transfer mixture to slow cooker, and cover.

* Cook on High for 45 minutes, then reduce heat to Low, and cook for 4 to 8 hours.  (**I did 1.25 hours on High, 3.5 hours on Low, then left it for 3 hours on Warm**)

1362116362.0	19g4rg	Sweet Juicy BBQ Pulled Pork in the Crock Pot	ryanhrap	40	9	16	"Here is a great recipe I have been making for years in the crock pot. It makes a great Pulled Pork that everyone will love.

**You will need:**

* -Bone in pork shoulder (I cook for 5 so usually I get one of the bigger ones at the supermarket)
* -12oz of your Favorite BBQ Sauce (I like using sweet baby rays)
* -1/4-1/2 cup of Orange Juice (This is the key to the recipe)
* - 1-1.5 oz Jack Daniels (or your favorite whiskey, Jack is just the sweetest)

First, Take your pork shoulder and trim some of the visible fat off of the shoulder. I like to do this because it makes the final product less greasy and more healthy. 

In your Crock pot, pour in the BBQ sauce, Orange Juice, and Jack Daniels. At first, you may think the mixture smells like Jack Daniels, but as it cooks, the alcohol cooks off and it gives a good smokiness.Then put your pork shoulder in and roll it around in the mixture to get it fully covered. This will not only mix your sauce up but it will also coat the pork. Once the pork is coated, place it bone side/skin side up. Then place your crock pot on Low for ~6 hours and enjoy the smell of it cooking. After ~6 Hours, I like to take the pork out and put it on a plate. At this time I will cut off any of the skin that is on the shoulder and cut the meat off of the bone. I just do this in big chunks and then place them back into the crock pot. You can throw the bone out at this time. Let it go for another hour or so on low. Then take the pork out and shred it on a plate. I feel that using your hands is good (sometimes hot!) or just two forks. If you are not able to cut the meat off of the bone at ~6 hours, it is okay to just do it all at once at 7 hours. After shredding the meat, you can put it in the crock pot for as long as you would like to. Sometimes I do an hour, but sometimes I am just too hungry. 
I like to serve it on round or long rolls with some american Cheese.

Any left overs will freeze great for a quick easy meal later on.

12 boneless skinless chicken thighs (about 3 pounds)
3/4 cup sugar
3/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce
6 tablespoons cider vinegar
3/4 teaspoon ground ginger
3/4 teaspoon minced garlic
1/4 teaspoon pepper
4 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch
4 1/2 teaspoons cold water
Hot cooked long grain rice

Place chicken in a 4 qt. slow cooker.  In a large bowl, combine the sugar, soy sauce, cider vinegar, ginger, garlic and pepper.  Pour over chicken.  Cover and cook on low for 4 to 5 hours or until chicken is tender.  Remove chicken to a serving platter; keep warm.  Skim fat from cooking liquid.  Place liquid in a saucepan and bring to a boil.  Combine cornstarch and water until smooth.  Gradually stir into liquid and stir until sauce is thickend.  Serve with chicken and rice.

However!!! I put in the cornstarch and water in with the chicken and forgot it was to be used only in the sauce after taking the chicken out. Will this still work - or should I take out the chicken- rinse, and start over?????

I was hoping for a suggestion of a slow cooker to buy.

Instead, someone suggested I get a temperature controller... like the ones used for sous vide cooking (think immersion circulator that they drag out on Iron Chef occasionally).

Anyway! Anyone here ever used this before? 

[My BIFL post](http://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1ckfcj/bifl_request_slow_cooker/)

Basically you hook your cooker into it, then drop a temp prob into your food... and set the temp for the probe to say... 175F. The controller would turn the slow cooker off and on to maintain that temperature instead of boiling the crap out of your food. You can also use rice cookers.

EDIT.  All done and eaten (tons of it left though), very nice.  Things I learned:

1) I think next time I'll use half the amount of cider vinegar.  I can kind of taste it in the background and its not doing it for me.  Anyone know how this will effect the tenderness of the meat?

2) I might have used to little Dr Pepper.  Should I have covered the meat, the liquid only got about half way up the joint and the meat that was submerged seemed to be more tender and tasty.

3) I need to use a proper joint from my butcher, not a crappy joint from the supermarket.  It was good, but my butchers meat is definitely better quality.

1353919986.0	13szxe	Help me out here slow cookers. Watery and flavourless?	lopples	34	4	35	"I'm slow cooking mainly to provide cheap, nutritious lunches for my 5 days at work. Last week I tried slow cooking about 1.2kg diced chicken, a head of broccoli, an onion, several carrots, potatoes, and seasoned with rosemary and 5 cups of chicken stock - it barely fit in my 4.5L cooker! After 5 hours on high it was all cooked but basically like a soup. The chicken also tasted bland and dry.

Fast forward to this week, I cooked about 1.2kg diced blade steak along with two onions, two leeks, several carrots, two tins of crushed tomatoes (reduced on the stove for about 20 minutes) and just 1 cup of beef stock. After 8 hours on low it's all cooked and the beef is really tender but it's rather flavourless and still quite watery! 

Since I'm stuck with these meals for a week, can anyone give me some sort of idea where I'm going wrong? I'm following recipes online and wondering how I could be getting it so wrong?

1352041049.0	12m2ua	First attempt at BBQ pulled chicken and have questions	brennok	38	5	13	"I decided I would finally try using my slow cooker for something other than BBQ meatballs. I figured I would try the BBQ pulled chicken. I know, quite daring of me, but with a cooking skill of frozen burgers and grilled cheese I had to start somewhere.

I bought

* 2.25 lbs of boneless skinless chicken breasts, 3 breasts
* 1.75 lbs of boneless skinless chicken thighs, 6 of them
* 2 bottles Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory and Brown Sugar sauce

I figured I would just combine the two cuts since I have read complaints that the breast by itself comes out too dry. 

My original plan was to just toss the two together and add sauce, but this morning I came across a couple recipes that used Coke instead similar to the popular pulled pork recipe which I haven't had a chance to try. For some reason it makes sense on pork to me, but not sure how good it sounds with chicken.  Has anyone tried soda with chicken? 
  
Also approximately how long would you say I should cook 4lbs of boneless, skinless chicken on low? Or am I better off on high for chicken? Some of the recipes mention as little as 5 hours and some go as long as 8-10 hours. Thanks for the help.

EDIT: Opted for low on 8 hours with only BBQ sauce. I hope I used enough sauce. Worst case I can add some more. There is a layer between the breasts and thighs also.

Not long ago I whipped up a stew using almost everything I had in my fridge/freezer and it was phenomenal (doo do do doo do)!

Ingredients:

* 1lb cubed stew beef
* 3/4 lb of bacon 
* 1 lb of spicy italian venison sausage
* carrots
* celery
* onion
* green pepper
* mushrooms
* corn
* sweet potatoes
* yellow potatoes

I don't really measure with seasonings, I usually just grab from the pantry and guess, but from what I remember I used the following:

* 1/2 cup of pinot noir
* 2 beef bullion cubes
* bay leaf
* oregano
* salt
* pepper
* cayenne
* dill (quite a bit)
 * minced garlic

The corn and carrots were frozen, and the rest of the veggies were freshly cut. I cooked the bacon and sausage in a cast iron skillet- last time I put bacon in a stew and didn't cook it first I wasn't happy with it. 

Put it all in and let it cook for 6-8 hours on low, or until the potatoes are soft. 
In the end it was delicious.

My main goal is to use it as a slow cooker, so I've tried to make some chicken broth. I've turned the cooker on yesterday at noon, and stopped it this morning at 8, so it has been on for about 20 hours. The broth tasted horrible, but that might be the ingredients or the taste of the new machine.

1345835204.0	yroh9	Slow cooking took my oatmeal to the next level	rmull	34	5	6	"I like oatmeal in the morning, and after recently acquiring a slow cooker, I like it even more. Here's what I do:

* 1.5 cups steel cut oats
* 0.5 cups shredded coconut
* 7 cups filtered water
* 1 T butter
* 1 cinnamon stick (ceylon, not cassia)
* 1 t cardamom seeds

Cook on low overnight, usually ~6hr for me. If you get up in the night, give it a good stir, or you'll have to chip some of it off the sides in the morning.

When done, store in the fridge. You'll have enough for about a week.

To reheat, I scoop out a portion and add a bit of water to help reconstitute it. Crack an egg into it and scramble it up, then microwave on high for maybe 1m30s. Pull it out and stir again, making sure the egg is cooked enough, then stir in any fruit or nuts you like. I like raisins, cranberries, or chopped dates.

Add about a tablespoon of dried milk at this point - it really lends to the creaminess of the oatmeal, and has earned a permanent spot in my cupboard. Stir it in well so that it dissolves.

I always have frozen bananas in the freezer. These must be left out on the counter until they are very ripe, then peeled and frozen. Chop up half a frozen banana and add it to the oatmeal. They get really soft and delicious, and help cool down the oatmeal.

Lightly stir in some brown sugar or maple syrup, and hopefully by this time your coffee is ready as well. Nice way to start each day, and preparation is minimal.

Pot roast attempt #1

* Eye of round roast 3lb-5lb?
* 1 can beef consumme
* Use same can for 1 can of water
* Handful of baby carrots
* 2 potatoes cubed
* 2 tbl spoon minced garlic
* 8oz mushroom sliced
* Half white onion sliced long
* Flour
* Salt &amp;amp;amp; pepper
* 4 tbl spoon butter
* 2 tbl spoon soy sauce
* Jasmine rice (optional - used as something to mix with your pot roast)

Instructions:


Generously salt and pepper both sides of the eye of round. 
Sift a thin layer of flour on each side and massage it in.

In a pan, brown each side of the eye of round briefly. Put aside the meat.

In the pan, add all the butter, mushrooms, onion, and garlic and cook it until the liquid becomes a thick sauce and the mushrooms and onion are cooked well. Add a tablespoon of flour to this and mix it, oh and your 2 tbl spoon of soy sauce - put it in there too.

Throw your eye of round in the slow cooker, add your can of beef consumme, can of water, carrots, potato, and the mushroom &amp;amp;amp; onion you cooked. Turn low and cook for 8 hours.

Now, I like rice because I'm part Filipino. So I cook my jasmine rice in a rice cooker and use this as something to mix in with my food. The rice does not go into the slow cooker, just add to your serving plate.



Edit: added (optional) rice. Also added soy sauce in ingredients "	t5_2s64w	True

Québec Pea Soup

The easiest, most delicious and addictive soup you might ever make. So easy to make. No soaking, no broth. Just dice some vegetables and put all the ingredients in a slow cooker and cover with water.

* 1 bag of yellow split peas (about a pound usually)
* Ham bone with bits of meat
* Diced vegetables (3 carrots, 2-3 stalks of celery with chopped celery leaves if you have them, 2 onions)
* 2 teaspoons ground savory. (Very important, do not skip)
* Pepper
* DO NOT SALT (The ham is salty and you could easily over-salt, adjust after cooking)
* Water to cover everything (a 5 quart cooker will be completely full)

Cook for 3-4 hours on very very low burner or in slow cooker, not much longer since the peas get very delicate and crumbly. You can use salt pork or bacon. Make sure you put little bits of meat back in the soup. Seriously this soup is like crack.

Depending if you use a discarded ham bone or bacon or salt pork, cost is about 30-60 cents per large portion."	t5_2s64w	True

I usually grab whatever chunk of beef is on sale (roasts, stew meat, etc). I've been meaning to try this with chicken, haven't gotten around to it yet.

Next must have is chili powder. I use the one called ""Mexican Chili Powder"" just because it appeared in my kitchen. (You'll notice a distinct lack of specificity and measurement here... I made this up and just kind of wing it every time. I'm a rebel. That, and crockpots are very forgiving.)

Our liquid today is dark beer. I prefer Guinness, but I often use the darkest beer in our fridge, for example Dos Equis Amber does just fine.

Finally: Mexican hot chocolate. You know, the polygonal slabs that require milk (husband tried using water one time... Silly husband).

I sear the meat if I'm not feeling lazy. Toss the meat in the crockpot with the beer (1-2 bottles I suppose. I frequently throw too much in, but I let it cook down with the lid off as needed), one slab of the chocolate, some chile powder (to preference) and usually some veggies (carrots, onion, depends or what I have handy). Salt, pepper, always.

Let me emphasize *very simple* because the posts I've read where people ask for simple recipes get responses like, ""Just use these ten ingredients, simmer, boil, baste, ritually sacrifice a goat at the quarter-hour mark and lightly sprinkle blood droplets over the sauce, and then it should be delicious."" Scrambling eggs is the current height of my culinary abilities. I'm looking to improve, but baby steps, people, baby steps.

I really like thai curry and it sounds like it's possible to make it in a slow cooker. I'm hoping for something along the lines of ""put in X amount of rice, Y amount of beef, Z amount of curry powder, stir, ignore for 4 hours,"" but if there's a few more ingredients or steps I'll do my best not to screw it up too badly.

So, I'm scheming how to make some Peking-ish ducks in the slow cooker.

The goal is make something that we can load up into some moo shu pancakes, and enjoy. I'm going to throw this out there, and I'd love to hear your feedback.

**Ingredients**
 
* 3 small water fowl (~1.5 - 2.0 lbs each)
* 1/4 cup hoisin sauce
* 1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce
* 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
* 2 tablespoons grated ginger
* 1 teaspoon sesame oil
* 6 scallions, white and light green parts only, finely sliced lengthwise
* 1 small cucumber, seeded and cut into 4-inch long matchsticks
* Moo shu pancakes

**Directions**

* Combine hoisin, soy sauce, broth and ginger in crockpot. Nestle birds into the liquid. Cook on low for 6 hours.

* Pull birds out, remove and discard skin. Shred duck meat.

* Remove the fat from the cooking liquid (either with a fat separator, or with a wide spoon (and a lot of patience)). Bring cooking liquid to a boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to a simmer. Reduce cooking liquid by half. Return liquid and duck meat to slow cooker. Stir. Let cook on low for another 30 minutes.

* To serve: heat a 1/4 teaspoon sesame oil over medium low heat in a saute pan. Cook a pancake in the saute pan, make sure it's heated through. Place 4 tablespoons of duck mixture, and a couple scallion spears. Roll up, and enjoy."	t5_2s64w	True

1 large onion

3/4 carrots chopped

2 Bottles Guinness

Salt, pepper

Brown the onion slowly in a little oil or butter.

While its browning put a couple of tablespoons plain flour into a plastic bag, add a pinch of salt and pepper and then add the meat and kidneys and mix around so they all get coated with the flour.

When the onions are coloured, put them into the crock pot, along with the carrots. Add the meat on top, and then cover everything with Guinness. Throw in a beef stock cube, whatever herbs or spices you fancy and cook on low for 8 hours or so.

About 30 minutes before you want to serve, mix 2 tablespoons of cornflour with 2 tablespoons water, and stir into the stew to thicken.

* 9 oz. pkg. frozen baby peas
* 1 cup sliced mushrooms
* 1 medium onion, chopped
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 1 tsp. dried thyme leaves
* 1/8 tsp. pepper

Directions:

1. Cut and put potato, carrots, onion, garlic, and mushrooms in bottom of crock pot. 

2. In medium bowl, combine chicken broth, flour, salt, pepper, and thyme, and mix until smooth. 

3. Pour over vegetables in crockpot. 

4. Cut chicken into 2 in. strips and add to top of pot.

5. Cover crockpot and cook on LOW for 8 hours.

6. When the chicken is thoroughly cooked and falling apart, turn your pot on HIGH.

7. Add frozen peas and biscuit balls and cook for 20 additional minutes until biscuits are no longer doughy inside.



This is the recipe I've been using to make Chicken &amp; Dumplings. It's great, but can anyone answer a few questions for me?

1. I want to broth to be creamier (I think that's the word I'm looking for). It comes out pretty clear like chicken broth or soup, and I prefer it to be opaque and more like stew. I thought adding flour would make it creamier, but it doesn't.

2. The biscuits I'm using completely disintegrate into the soup, aka, no more dumplings. What kind should I use? 

You can still taste the biscuits when you eat it, and this actually kind of solves the first problem by making the mixture a bit creamier, but I want DUMPLINGS! And I like the doughy kind of dumplings, not the biscuity kind. I've been using Pilsbury flaky biscuits, which I assume is the problem since the biscuits cook and flake apart.

1341265457.0	vy1l1	Slow cooker roast chicken gone wrong - why??	IsayLOLoutloud	28	3	20	"So yesterday I made roast chicken in my new 6.5l crock pot. I placed some raw veg on the bottom and then a 1.6kg raw chicken on top which I rubbed with salt, pepper and paprika. I also placed some garlic cloves under the skin, half a lemon ""in"" either end, covered the thing with fresh rosemary and lemon thyme and then finally placed slices of lemon on top. I cooked it for about 10hrs on low.

When I tasted it the chicken was very tender (except the breasts which were a little dry) and not massively flavoursome, but the veg was inedible! It was all kinda bitter, and there was a lot of liquid there (I hadn't added any extra). It smelt so good but I was so disappointed at the result :(

Can anyone give me any tips for the future? I did make some chicken stock from the remains at least :-/"	t5_2s64w	True

This sounds like it will explode if I do that.

I mean why not? I always read that and also that you're not supposed to reheat stuff with it. But not even once is any sort of explanation given.

When I cook food in my pan or a normal pot I leave it in there just like that (yes, at **room temperature**) and eat stuff from it the next day. I haven't died so far and also I didn't experience any explosions.

So I just bought a slowcooker and I’ll be making a vegetable soup in it tomorrow.  Being completely new to slowcooking (and cooking in general) I wanted to get some advice on how to go about making it in the slow cooker so that it actually comes out tasting decent.  I’ll be adding the following to the soup:


* Brown Rice

* Chicken breast

* Onion

* Potato

* Carrot

* Celery

* Bean Sprouts

* Parsley

* Tomato

* Chicken Broth

* Vegetable Broth

* Spices


So the first question is how should I go about cooking this soup?  I know I should cook the onion potato celery and carrot first along with the broths, but for how long?  How close to the end should I add the rice chicken?  And the other vegetables?  Should I cook the rice and chicken separately or add them in and let them cook in the soup?  When should I add the spices?  And how much of the slow cooker should I leave free?  How long in general should I cook everything


I would really appreciate anyone’s help on this so thanks in advance to anyone who helps!

But that means it'll be done with the first stage of cooking at 8 or 9 am tomorrow, and dinner's not till 6. Is it ok to fork-shred it tomorrow morning when I wake up, then keep it in the fridge until it's time for the last hour of cooking with the barbecue sauce? Will this adversely affect the consistency or flavor?

It has settings for 4, 6, 8, and 10 hours. If it came with a manual, it got thrown out with the box. The 4 and 6 end is labeled high and the 8 and 10 end is labeled low. 

So does that mean it has only two temperatures, high and low, and I can go high for 4 or 6 hours or low for 8 or 10? Or is it really more like 4-high, 6-med-high, 8-med-low, 10-low? Do we know what the actual temperatures are? 

And if I've got something that should ideally cook for 8 hours on low, is the fixed time-to-temperature scale of this sort of pot set up to mean that if I instead choose 4 hours on high, it would still get done well enough? I know there are advantages to cooking many things low and slow, which I would think would be best, but sometimes you don't have time. 

If I want to cook something on low for 4 or 6 hours, I'm guessing I need to choose 8/low and then set my own independent timer to let me know when 6 has passed.

1357937566.0	16edj0	My Peanut Butter/beer Chili slowcook recipe	mapguy	24	3	14	"If you give this a go, I hope you enjoy it, you may find it an unusual combination of tastes, but I find them to be rather amazing.  Also, I don't always use standard measurements, but I think you will understand it.

**The goods:**

* 1 lb. of ground beef

* 2 cans (15oz) chili or kidney beans; drained

* 1 can (15oz) chili beans with spicy sauce

* 1 can (28oz) diced tomatoes

* 1 can (6oz) tomato paste

* 1 small yellow onion

* 1 green pepper

* 2 jalapeno peppers (SEEDED!)

* 1 pack of beef bullion 

* 1/3 cup of bacon bits (or 3 strips of real bacon)

* 2 tablespoons chili powder

* 1 teaspoon garlic powder

* 10 shakes of dried oregano

* 1 teaspoon cumin

* 5 shakes dried basel

* 3/4 teaspoon salt

* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper

* 3/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

* 1/2 teaspoon paprika

* 3/4 teaspoon sugar

* 15 shakes of worcestershire sauce 

* 3 loops around the slow cooker bowl with Sriracha (or your favorite hot sauce)

* 8 oz of your favorite beer (I use stouts as I think they are the best when cooking with beef)

* 1 cup creamy peanut butter




**Prep:**
Brown the beef.  While that is browning, add the 3 cans of beans, diced tomatoes and tomato paste.  When the beef is done, don't drain it, add all of it to the mix(fat will add flavor and a bit of thickener).  Next I chop up the produce and add, then follow up with all the spices.  Then comes the 8 oz of beer(the rest of the beer makes its way to my belly). This is going to make the chili pretty liquidy, and if you are like me, I prefer my chili thick.  Now comes the peanut butter.  This adds a few things.  It acts as a thickener, it adds a lot of protein, and it cuts down on some of the spice.  I tend to let the crock go for about an hour on high before I add the peanut butter so it mixes easier.  Just stir it in.  You will see a noticeable change in the thickness of the chili and a change in the color.  When you get your desired taste, 4-6 hours on low will do the job.  I turn off crock a half hour before serving.  I hope you enjoy it!

I use eye of the round or sirloin roasts, they go on sale for very cheap here, but you can use whatever you have.  Also, for beef stock you can use cubes, liquid, cartons, whatever you have.  This recipe is really meant to use what you have, so you don't have to buy anything.

**FIRST DAY**

**Beef Dip** 
(Also called French Dip)

* Beef roast
* Beef bouillon
* Water
* .5 tsp Onion powder
* .5 tsp Garlic powder
* Pepper
* Crusty buns

Fill crockpot half full, and add proper amount of beef bouillon to taste.  (Your product should give directions).  Mix in all spices and stir.  Add beef roast, put on low for eight hours, and walk away.  When roast is to desired doneness, remove and slice thinly (or shred) and put back in pot.  Meanwhile, butter or oil sliced crusty buns, and fry until quite brown.  With tongs, pull out desired amount of beef and put on bun, add bun top.  Ladle some broth into a small, wide-mouthed cup, and dip sandwich in it and enjoy!  Very simple, but so good.  Refrigerate remaining broth.

**SECOND DAY**

*Beef Barley Soup*

* Left over broth (add more if needed)
* Left over beef
* Diced carrots
* Pot barley

Prepare desired broth.  Cut remaining beef into smaller pieces, add to broth.  Dice carrots quite small (I would use approximately 1.5 cups of diced carrots for a large crockpot 2/3 full of broth).  Add to broth.  Add pot barley. (I would add about a cup of barley, but I reallllly like barley!). Add more spices if desired (onion, garlic, pepper), put crockpot on low for 8 hours, and walk away.  Trust me....you will be amazed at how good/simple this is!  Enjoy!

Tri tip roast, chuck roast, chuck shoulder roast, eye of round roast, bottom round rump roast, top round roast, shoulder roast, picnic roast.

So my question is what is the general one or two roast that recipes are referring to if it just says ""roast"" in the recipe? Are they always referring to a boneless one as well? Several of the ones in the store had bones in them.

Long story short I had a pumpkin base, some chicken and not-very-fresh vegetables I was willing to cook the hell out of. So here it is! Just a note, these are estimates, and I recommend you spice to taste.

___

1 29oz Can Libby's Pumpkin

3 Chicken Breasts, cut into small cubes

1 15oz can diced tomatoes (don't drain! This is important, the soup will be too thick and the pumpkin might kinda goop up)

1/3 cup olive oil

1/2 cup chicken stock (Add enough to make the pumpkin slightly more liquidy)

Garlic in some form (I use garlic flakes and just eat them whole, but you might not want to)

1/2-2/3 cup sliced carrots

1/2 cup diced shallots/green onions

1 cup diced bell peppers

Cayenne pepper

2 tsp Cumin

Thyme (I'd recommend about 2 teaspoons)

Salt and pepper to taste

I cooked all these up for about 4 hours on high heat (I have an eight quart), kept it on for 2 more on low just so the carrots didn't get overly mushy. 
You can easily make this vegan, just substitute chicken stock with vegetable stock, add some meat substitute or just simply add more veggies that you like besides bell peppers and carrots. It'd probably go well with some potatoes in it, only I didn't have any.

-Sprinkle with pepper, cover, and cook on low 3-4 hours (I've done up to 5), or until meat temperature reads at *least* 160 degrees F. 
-Serve with small bowl of cooking liquid as au jus.

1358592759.0	16vdru	Slow cooked crispy-ish ginger game hen with carrots idea [FP]	hypes	26	7	6	"So I couldn't sleep, and this idea came to me while I was coding and watching a movie... going to go get the ingredients now to start it.

- A large apple, thinking a green one would be best
- Some soy sauce
- 2 Rock Cornish game hen halfed
- Some dry rice wine
- Couple of tablespoons orange marmalade
- 1/2 lemon
- Grated ginger
- Lotsa garlic
- shredded carrots and some sliced celery (for texture)

Think I'll cut the hens down the back and put them under the broiler first for a bit... then throw everything in the cooker on low.  Maybe build a glaze and then use it at the end to build the sauce.  

I'll post pics if it worked...

1358216211.0	16lb54	What's your best bean recipe? Mine is Black Bean Chili...	bobthereddituser	23	4	6	"So, for a variety of reasons I have decided to start eating more beans. Mostly because they are cheap and rather healthy. I've also found they lend themselves well to slow cookers, so I figured I'd ask here if anyone has any good recipes. My goal is a recipe for each of the major beans I can get in the local grocery (pinto, black eye, lentils, etc...)

Here's my current favorite: Black bean chili

Keep one small package of black beans in the cooker overnight on warm to soften them up. In the morning, switch out the water with fresh water.  Add some sliced beef. Season with black pepper, cumin, chili powder, and chicken bullion (or salt), and turmeric - all to taste.

Cook 6-8 hours (I use low setting). 

When ready to eat, puree 1 onion and one roasted pepper. Sautee over high heat until the onions are cooked and add into the beans. 

Add in chopped cilantro and some frozen corn.

Serve with sour cream, avocados, or pico de gallo. Or all of the above.


I recognize that the final step isn't slow cookery - don't hate me for it."	t5_2s64w	True

I've just laid the bottom with onions, thrown in 6 chicken breasts, taco seasoning, a couple squirts of salsa and a cup of water and left it in the oven at 100C (212F) for about 4-5 hours. Just wanted to know if I've messed this up in any way and if there's any tips for a newbie?
Cheers

EDIT: So just finished the meal. Turned out great, except maybe a little too much onion and I probably didn't need to add any water at all. This is the recipe if anyone's interested and it fed 5 of us with a little bit leftover with no side dishes at all! http://imgur.com/m9QC6

* 3 small onions (1 red, 2 white) (Would probably be better with just 1 or 2 white)
* 6 chicken breasts
* 1 pack fajita seasoning (I would have made my own but we had no chili powder and this came with the tortillas)
* Various dashes of different spices (Cumin, Cayenne pepper, Paprika, Chili flakes)
* 2 Good squeezes of salsa (I just finished off a bottle so not sure how much exactly)
* A cup of water (didn't need it at all)
* Cooked for 2.5 hours at 85C
* Added 3 julienned bell peppers
* Cook for a further 30 mins
* Serve with flour tortillas, guacamole, salsa, sour cream, lettuce and tomato.

Really happy with the peppers. Adding them late meant they were just cooked while still crunchy.  I probably could have taken it out a bit earlier though. Some of the chicken was a little bit dry, but overall it was delicious, and I'm giving Dr pepper pulled pork a go tomorrow. I heard cooking with a Dutch oven needs less time than a crockpot so if you're trying it you'd probably have to adjust the time. Thanks for the advice"	t5_2s64w	True

I've made several different dishes now, but I just thought I'd share the first one I made for any other newcomers (or seasoned slow cooker veterans) who care to try it out.

&gt;**Spanish Chicken**

* 1 large onion, chopped (1 cup)
* 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
* 1 large red bell pepper, chopped
* 1 tsp. dried oregano
* 1/2 to 1 tsp. crushed red pepper
* 1 lb. turkey Italian sausages, cut into 1 inch pieces (I couldn't find any turkey Italian sausage, just used regular pork Italian sausage)
* 1 1/4 lbs. boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1 inch pieces
* 1 can (28 oz.) diced tomatoes, undrained
* 1 can (6 oz) tomato paste
* 1 can (14 oz.) artichoke heart quarters, drained
* 1 can (4 oz.) sliced ripe olives, drained
* 3 Cups hot cooked rice to use at serving time (pasta works great too!)

&gt;Spray inside of 3-4 quart cooker with cooking spray. Mix all ingredients EXCEPT artichoke hearts, olives &amp; rice/pasta in slow cooker.

&gt;Cook on LOW for 6-8 hours, until sausages &amp; chicken are no longer pink in center.
