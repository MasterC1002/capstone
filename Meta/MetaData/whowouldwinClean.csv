It's mission is to save humanity (and therefore, skynet) from an infestation of xenomorphs (from the Alien franchise).

The terminator arrives at the same time as a single alien queen facehugger. It has limited knowledge about the aliens and doesn't know exactly where the infestation starts or who will be infected first. It cannot reveal itself or give details about the aliens to humans, although it can fool them (or force them) into helping it. It is not equipped with a nuclear reactor and may not destroy the entire area, as that would cause too much disruption to the time-line. It must hunt and kill all the aliens which manage to emerge individually, ideally killing the queen before it can lay any eggs."	t5_2s599	True
1368558896.0	1ebzbw	Desmond Miles (Assassin's Creed), Sam Fisher (Splinter Cell), Niko Bellic (GTA), James Bond, and Faith (Mirror's Edge) are all hiding from Batman in an epic game of hide and seek in New York City.	PapaBear12	306	43	329	"Who gets caught first? Last? Does anyone stick it out for the week and not get caught?


Conditions:

-It is hide and go seek tag. They have to get touched by Batman to get caught.

-Batman is relying on his detective skills and instincts alone, no gadgets like a GPS tracker or weapons. Similarly, the hiding contenders are unarmed and have no gadgets.

-Batman has researched all of these people thoroughly for a five days before the game.

-Batman closed his eyes in front of the Empire State Building and counted to 100 before going after them.

-Batman has decided not to purposely go after them in any particular order. He'll go with the first clue he finds and work on it.

-No one can leave NYC.

-Batman has one week to complete the game.

-No violence. It's just hide and go seek tag.

-All of the people hiding have $150 to spend however they'd like. They may not access any other personal funds. Batman has no money. They can also find ways to make more money.

-Having said that, Batman has enough food and water for the week...

Things to keep in mind:

-This is NYC, not Gotham City or Liberty City, similar though they may be. Assume no one has the advantage in terms of geography.

-Niko and Faith are not stealthy like Desmond and Fisher, but have other tools at their disposal to succeed (Faith's parkour skills, Niko's ability to hotwire cars, etc.)

EDIT: Remember that Fire-type Pokemon can set the plains ablaze, especially Charizard and Moltres, who can get into the heart of the lion horde from above and rain down fire from above.

EDIT: The Pokemon, while they have limited PP with their Pokemon moves, can still engage in simple combat without it counting against their PP. A tackle is just a tackle, but a Pokemon Tackle (with PP) is more damaging.

EDIT: When the Pokemon sleep, just like the Lions, they recover strength and energy. Their PP and HP recover when they sleep overnight.

***Here's how /u/1stOnRt1 thinks the Pokemon win:***

Dugtrio, Sandslash, Diglett, Sandshrew set up multiple fissures, to establish a first line of defence, allowing for the plateau and general defences to be arranged.

Terraforming/Wall Build: Geodude, Onix, Graveler, Golem, Ryhorn, Rhydon, NidoKing, Nidoqueen, Snorlax, Poliwrath, Machoke, Machamp

Before hunger and general battle attrition begin to set in, flying types rain down hell on the temporarily restrained lions. Pidgey/Pidgeotto/Pigeot/Spearow/Fearow using moves like hurricane and aeroblast to destroy from above. Charizard/Articuno/Zapdos/Moltres/Aerodactyl fucking the lions with their respective elemental advantages from above and Zubat and Golbat attacking at the flanks with confusion rays and supersonic attacks.

Non-water dependant water types (squirtle, wartortle, blastoise, poliwag, poliwhirl, poliwrath, psyduck, golduck, slowpoke, slowbro, krabby, kingler, staryu, starmie, vaporeon, omanyte, kabuto) split into day and night shifts, working with the day and night assist teams of Electric (Voltorb, Electrode, Pikachu, Raichu, Jolteon, Electabuzz) and Ice (Jynx, Cloyster, Dewgong) types to coat down the battlefield with hydropump and then shocking and freezing the lions to death. 

Chansey runs the hospital with her assistants, Nidoran, Nidoran, Nidorino, Nidorina, Rattata, Raticate, Clefairy, Clefable, Meowth

Support Staff of Abra (and the newly repurposed Pidgey, Pidgeotto, Spearow Doduo, Dodrio, Zubat, Golbat and Farfetched) are sent on harvisting missions 

Rock and Ground types (Geodude, Onix, Graveler, Golem, Ryhorn, Rhydon, Dugtrio, Sandslash, Diglett, Sandshrew) now work on building an escape tunnel and a more permanent road with which to acquire food. Sending the fastest pokemon (Rapidash, Ponyta, Scyther, Dodrio) along it once it is developed.

Poison and Grass types work as artillery launching attacks eg seed bomb over the wall, or use the flying types to whirlwind poison powders or acid sprays upon the lions.

Psychic types work to maintain order during the more intense moments, and work with the ghost types to mentally torture and turn the lions on eachother all the other times.

Ditto operates as our informant and spy

Mew does whatever the fuck mew wants, Mewtwo and Alakazam rock out. 

------
***Here's what /u/Helmet_Icicle has to say about the number of lions:***

I think this eventually boils down to an endurance trial for the Pokemon. A single Pokemon can only be attacked by so many lions at one time, probably somewhere around ten lions. A good number of Pokemon would be easily dispatched by a single lion, and a smaller number would be able to slaughter prides of lions. One billion is a very large number, though.

It looks like the question here is whether the top tier Pokemon would be able to last until the end of the lions. Let's say powerful moves like Earthquake with a large AOE can kill one hundred lions at a time. That move will still need to be used ten million times to kill one billion lions.

I'm going to go with the lions. One billion is indubitably huge."	t5_2s599	True

**This is a work in progress, it may not be 100% foolproof yet. Try to find exceptions that break it to see if it works.**

I recently had a conversation with /u/Sonofarakh in his post, [Hulk with a Red Power Ring Versus Superboy Prime](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1gq7ue/hulk_with_a_red_power_ring_versus_superboy_prime/), and these rules came up. We use them all the time in this sub, but I never put them in a format like this, so if you guys like it, we'll fix it up and make it something more official. Depending on the response, I may do a series of these for some of our other ""nearly unbeatable"" fighters, to put in the sidebar.

##The 5 Rules of Hulk 

*(Or however many we end up with.)*

1. If you're going to try and beat him to death, Hulk needs to start at a rage so low compared to his opponent, that no amount of rage could close the gap in power and durability before Hulk falls. Hulk's *weakest* is 100 tons. That's when Hulk is at his calmest, with no rage whatsoever. Most fights that involve the Hulk don't make sense to have him start that weak. If his opponent is an even match, Hulk will soon outclass them. If the opponent is somewhat stronger, Hulk will eventually surpass them. If the opponent is much stronger, they can beat Hulk before he can get strong enough to resist. If they are not capable of beating him before he becomes too strong for them to beat, then they can't beat him physically. 

 A. Attacking Bruce Banner will result in the Hulk emerging. Only in alternate universes and when his powers are somehow inaccessible has Banner ever been attacked without changing form before any serious damage is done.

 B.  Banner may be knocked out or rendered harmless by drugging him in human form, but not all poisons and tranquilizers work. Banner also still has the potential to become the Hulk even when heavily sedated. If you choose this route, be warned- it has failed almost as many times as it has been attempted.

2. If you're going to try and exhaust the Hulk, you must first know that rage is the source of Hulk's power, and that calming is the only way to lessen it. You must also be able to take the damage from Hulk while calming him, then be capable of sparring him until he exhausts himself. Sparring in such a way is difficult, because anything you do to anger the Hulk, like hitting him, will only make him stronger and replenish his stamina.


3. If you're going to try and manipulate reality, you must be capable of changing the Hulk's powers or the way they work.

4. If you're going to use energy attacks, extremely powerful magic is the only form he isn't highly resistant to in any incarnation. Only through a use of Rule 1 will most energy attacks succeed against Hulk. *(It should be noted that in the event of exposure to large amounts of certain (usually gamma) radiation or powerful dark magic, Hulk actually grows in power.)*

 A. Hulk has the ability to adapt to almost any conditions, and has been shown developing the ability to breathe underwater, breathe (or not need to) in space, and survive extremes in temperature. If you are going to try to use a natural force such as the Sun or a Black hole to beat Hulk and a Rule 1 is not possible, Hulk will not die. He may become trapped, but as suns and black holes both emit gamma radiation, if it doesn't kill him, he will only become stronger. Even without the gamma rays, the pain would make him angrier, and thus stronger. Use of cosmic phenomena *can* work, but only if it utilizes Rule 1. 

5. If you're going to try something else, intangibility and existing outside of the standard third dimensional laws have been shown to make one immune to the Hulk's might.


If none of the above can be applied to the fighter you're asking about, then they probably can't beat Hulk. Hulk gets stronger, more durable, faster, more agile, and can heal faster as he gets angrier, and he has NO LIMIT to his maximum power range. The only real limits we've seen are that he can't develop new powers, and he can't fight what he can't touch.

##List of evidence

*(This is where we show how the rules were used by those who beat him in the past. It will be restructured, but for now is a slightly formatted copy of my limited-knowledge response to Sonofarakh's list of those who have beaten Hulk before. Please correct what's wrong and add to what's incomplete.)*

 * Maul is one I'm unfamiliar with, but it seems that he won due to Rule 1.

 * Thor was originally written by Stan Lee to be stronger than the Hulk. He wins through use of Rules 1 and 2, and is one of the few to ever do so- not only successfully, but *repeatedly*. When he does not make use of these rules, or when Hulk trumps a Rule 1 with a sudden and massive power increase, Hulk can and has beaten Thor. This is largely due to Thor's refusal to actually kill Hulk or Banner.

 * The Maestro is a possible future version of the Hulk. Rule 1 and possibly 2.

 * Red Hulk used Rules 1, 4, and possibly 2.

 * Abomination *nearly* killed Hulk through use of Rule 1. Then Banner/Hulk beat him. 

 * Leader used Rules 1, 2, and 3, though I forget if his 3 was telepathic or technological. 

 * Wolverine has lost in every battle with the Hulk that didn't end in a stalemate, to my knowledge. Hulk even tore him in half and threw his legs three miles away, at one point. I imagine Wolverine has the potential to pull off a technical Rule 1 victory through use of Rule 2, thanks to his nearly infinite knowledge of martial arts. 

 * I can't remember Namor's battle, but in water his powers are immense, I'd have to see the fight to say for sure which rules, if any, apply. 

 * Zeus beat him too, through use of Rules 1, 4, and 5, with a possibility of Rule 3.

 * The Punnisher killed the Hulk in an alternate universe comic through use of Rule 1A. 

 * In WWH, it is suggested that Dr. Strange could easily kill Hulk with little more than a thought, but Strange chooses to try and help Hulk, which backfires. Still, had Strange attacked, even Warbound Hulk would have been vulnerable to a Rule 4 defeat from someone with a magical ability so high. This also counts as a variant of Rule 1. 

 * Also in WWH, The Sentry attempted to stop the Hulk through use of Rules 1, 2, and 4. His calming aura usually works against Hulk, but WWH showed us that even *that* is subject to the Rule 1 stipulations. If Hulk gets angry enough, Sentry's calming aura may stop or slow his rage growth, but Hulk can keep fighting even then. This fight was said to be a draw, but Banner was the last one standing even after both fighters reverted to human form, and then became an even stronger version of the Hulk only moments later when provoked.

Always state the version of Batman you are using. Comic, Movie, Animated, etc. If you do not, it will generally be assumed to be the Comic version.

Always limit Batman. If given enough time to prepare and enough resources, Batman can beat anyone. Not only is he able, it's inevitable. Batman doesn't trust anyone, especially not superhumans. He has a plan to neutralize each and every one he's aware of. 

If you aren't giving Batman any prep time, or if you're throwing him in blind to a fight he didn't expect, SAY SO. In fact, the more information you can give about the location and conditions of the fight, (ANY fight, not just those involving Batman) the better. 

Tell us where they're fighting, why they're fighting, how long they've known about each other, what the time limit might be, if help is allowed, etc. Anything that can make this Batman fight less ambiguous than every other Batman fight we've seen. 

Please, eliminate as much confusion as possible. 

Please, check to see if your fight has already been posted.

Please, reconsider using Batman at all. He is very overused in this sub, and frankly, we're all getting really sick of him. Use Nightwing, Batwoman, Batgirl, Deathstroke, or any of the Robins. We're not going to delete posts that use him, but I have to let everyone know, if this continues to be a problem, we won't have much choice.

* I will reply to you the details of the weapons/powers of you and the opponent.

* Then you reply to that with your plan of attack. Strategies, how you would use your power/weapons, etc.

**Edit 3: If I missed out anyone I am truly sorry but there are just so many request here that i am just burned out. But not to worry I will make sure I am much better prepared for the next one. Check the announcement below.**



**Announcement!!!: I plan to make a bigger post where you then fight each other on this subreddit in a Hunger Games style battle.

1372446886.0	1h9lq6	You vs Superman	pork-cow	105	17	92	"Scenario:  

All Kryptonite has become inert.  

Someone told Lex Luthor that they know a ""totally legit"" person who has a fool-proof ten year plan to kill Superman. Lex finds you and says that he's heard great things about you and that you're the contractor he's looking for. You're like ""what"", but he ignores it and gets you a staggeringly huge US defense contract (which he can do somehow) for 10 years to take out the Man of Steel once and for all.  

Setting: DC universe (your choice)  

Rules: You have 10 years prep and enough money for one or more DC universe megaprojects. Your objective is to kill *(or incapacitate) Superman by any means possible, but remember, there is no Kryptonite.  

If you try to recruit heroes to your side, Superman will find out within a day and attack you then and there.  

If you recruit villains, Superman will find out a year later and attack you with the whole Justice League behind him.  

Superman is off doing Superman things for the 10 years and doesn't even know who you are, let alone suspect a plan. It's hard to get the jump on someone with super hearing, super vision, and FTL super speed, though, so you probably won't be able to do a surprise attack unless you account for it.  

More Scenario:  

If you beat Superman, Lex will give you tactical command of his war machine and launch a campaign to defeat all the heroes and take over the world.  

If you lose to Superman, Lex will vaporize you (if you're not already vaporized) and enter the fray, revealing that it was all just a distraction and that he has laid into motion a plan to beat Superman and take over the world.  

Do you win and live? Do you lose and die? If you win, do you help Lex declare war on the world? What happens then? If you lose, does Superman beat Lex?  

So many questions, and the only one who can answer them is... you.  

How does this play out?  

*Edit: If you leave Superman alive, but no further threat to Lex's plans, Lex will consider the contract fulfilled."	t5_2s599	True

This is not the final chart. This is a list of the Fighters we have charted so far, ranked by their total score from weakest at the top to the strongest at the bottom. Fighters with the same score are listed alphabetically. Clicking a fighter's name will take you to their detailed chart.

Before you ask ""Why is so-and-so ranked as such-and-such?"" please read their information and check their wikis, if available. I am aware that some information may be wrong, and I am happy to change anything if evidence is provided. I just won't be able to get anything done if I'm explaining my logic on every stat for every character.

**Remember that this is not a finished product.** Many of these charts were submitted by volunteers and have not been checked for accuracy. If you know anything that can help, *please* list it below the relevant chart and I will edit it into the main chart **IF** you can provide a source to support the change. There is no way I can make these all perfect alone, so please check the charts of your favorite characters to be sure they're properly represented in the final system.

  

The Class system in place at the moment is not final, input is welcome.





Remember- With this new scale, a single point is less important than it was with our old scale. Fighters are much more accurately matched, but this does not and *will never mean* that they are perfect opponents. Some fighters may be grouped right next to someone they could never hope to beat. That's not something I am going to strive to avoid. It is part of the risk involved in this tournament. A gunslinger may face a bulletproof fighter, and a telepath may face a mindless opponent.

For reference and those who wish to attempt their own charting: [Tournament Stat List and Chart Template.](http://bit.ly/10sRCpm) If you choose to chart, please follow the existing format to increase the chances of your submission being accepted. [Post Charts Here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1fyblg/tournament_character_registration/) We are extremely backlogged and the charts are not always top priority, but we are still accepting input and suggestions- just know we might not get to it right away.

If I add your fighter's name to the list (the one below, in this post) but I don't attach a link to it, it means your chart needs to be edited to fit the format. (Staff members, it probably means I lost your chart, send me a link and I'll take care of the rest.) I will mention it once to you through PMs but I don't want to nag, so if it isn't changed I will *eventually* get to it and do it myself. To speed things up, let me know if you update a chart so I can link it for you.

You need to find the ONE thing you can do better than batman, or you, your hometown, your family and all your loved ones die. Batman will not go easy on you, he will try his hardest to win at anything you chose (He has been mind controlled by a Gypsy or something, and will not co-operate with you)

I am looking for in-universe duos, meaning you can't say Hawkeye and Green Arrow, being very similar characters, as they both hail from two different universes. 

In addition, I am not simply seeking characters that can fight, but characters that either have experience piloting mechs, or could translate their own fighting styles to the Jaeger without problem. For example, Mitsurugi from Soul Caliber is a very adept samurai, but he has not been *explicitly* shown to be a great user of hand-to-hand combat, what most Jaegers use.

For the most part, the Jaeger is generic, but would likely be similar to Gypsy Danger (focus on punching, has a powerful ranged weapon as well as an arm blade)."	t5_2s599	True

1369094851.0	1eqan1	How to Make a Battle Post	Wallzo	76	14	19	"There are multiple key elements within a battle. Prep, Knowledge, Location, whether a character is in his normal mindset, and how to actually win a battle. While all of these are key elements within a battle, I have noticed that many people on this subreddit don't really put out any info. So, here are the Standard Battle Rules:

* **How to win against a opponent**: Character A must either KO, Incap, or kill the Character B, unless stated it is stated otherwise.

* **Prep**: OP must state whether characters are given prep, and also how much time they are given. If it isn't stated, then they don't have prep.

* **Knowledge**: Knowledge can be broken down into three categories:

* 1) Common Knowledge: OP must state if characters are given knowledge. Whatever a person on the street in the characters universe would know.
* 2) Basic Knowledge: information that can be obtained by reading the characters wiki page or maybe looking at a Respect thread.
* 3) Extensive Knowledge: Access to every appearance of said character.
* 4) No Knowledge: characters have no information on each other.

* **Location**: Simple enough, just state where the battle takes place. If no location is given, then pretend it's inside of a typical white plain area, and that both characters are 100 feet apart and are able to see eachother.

* **Attitude**: Unless stated otherwise, characters will be in their normal mindset. Bloodlust means they desire to draw blood from the opponent and kill them. No Morals means that the character isn't messing around and are fighting to their full potential. BATTLE HISTORY IS IMPORTANT. It determines how a person normally fights.

* **Equipment**: OP must state if characters have special equipment from normal. If it isn't stated, the characters will have their normal equipment.

* **Iteration**: Unless stated otherwise, characters are in their current comic version. DC Characters are Post Crisis.

There's also plenty of room to add more metals or info columns, so suggestions are welcome. I'd really like some solid data on which is stronger than which, but it's difficult to come by. 

Now alphabetized. 

Metal|Qualities|||
:---|:---|:---|:---
Adamantium *(main Marvel timeline)*|Indestructible once cooled, cannot be reforged (save, potentially, by gods.) Most notably used by Weapon X on Wolverine's bones.|
Adamantium-vibranium alloy *(main Marvel timeline)*|The only known use of this metal is in Captain America's shield. The alloy grants it unusual properties, allowing it to absorb virtually all of the kinetic impact from any blows that the shield receives without injuring Rogers in the process. It also allows Rogers to throw and ricochet the shield to strike multiple opponents with little loss of velocity in its forward movement after each impact.|
Amazonium  *(main DC timeline)*|Indestructible, made from Zeus' impenetrable Aegis shield, can be reforged (perhaps only by the Gods) once cooled. Most notably used in Wonder Woman's Silver Bracelets.|
Anti-metal (Antarctic Vibranium) *(main Marvel timeline)*|Native to the Savage Land. This variation produces vibrations of a specific wavelength that breaks down the molecular bonds in other metals, causing them to liquefy. If huge quantities of anti-metal are gathered together, the vibrations increase exponentially. Anti-Metal is able to become an artificial and unstable form of the Wakandan variety of vibranium through certain particle bombardments.|
Baatorian Green Steel/Dajavva *(Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe)*|A steel alloy from the Lawful Evil outer plane of Baator. It is lighter and stronger than normal steel. Similar to mithril but with properties that make it a notably more deadly weapon. A similar form is Tanar'ri Red Steel (fan creation), which is stronger and thus more valuable. |
Beskar/Mandalorian Iron *(Star Wars universe)*|A near-indestructible iron ore. The introduction of certain additives during the smelting process serve to increase the strength of the natural ore. Able to withstand blows from even a lightsaber. In the foundry, carbons are added to the ore to create a molecular cage structure that allow Mandalorian iron to be lighter than contemporary metals in equal volume, while still retaining its incredible toughness. Without the addition of carbon, beskar is significantly heavier.|
Brightsteel *(Inheritance universe)*|A rare metal of extraterrestrial origin used to make Dragon Rider swords. Lighter than regular steel, and will always keep an edge. Brightsteel will will cut through all magic shields or enchantments, and it serves as a focal point for magic (like Brisingr). A brightsteel sword has a tendency to change color to match a Rider's dragon. Brightsteel by itself doesn't contain these properties, but gains them when forged while singing magic into the steel. Without enchanting it while forging, it is simply lighter, harder, and more flexible than steel.|
Carbonadium *(main Marvel timeline)*|A resilient, radioactive synthetic metal said to be nearly indestructible. Though it is not quite as strong as adamantium, it is very similar while being significantly cheaper and easier to work. The radiation given off by this metal dramatically slows healing abilities. Most notably used by Omega Red and Moon Knight.|
Celestial Bronze *(Percy Jackson/Heroes of Olympus universe)*|Mined from Mount Olympus, and deadly to creatures of the magical world. Unlike lesser mortals, who are immune to the weapons, demigods are also affected by it because of their blood. Artifacts of celestial bronze are known to emit a faint bronze glow. Monsters disperse into dust once a sword or weapon made up of the metal passes through them.|
Cortosis *(Star Wars universe)*|A very rare, brittle, fibrous material whose conductive properties cause lightsabers to temporarily short out upon contact, although the effect only lasts a few seconds. Commonly woven into armor or used to make anti-lightsaber melee weapons. |
Cuendillar/Heartstone *(Wheel of Time universe)*|An almost indestructible substance created during the Age of Legends. It absorbs any force attempting to break it, and is believed to become stronger as a result. The material can be and has been broken, but it is unknown what was responsible. |
Durasteel *(Star Wars universe)*|An incredibly strong and versatile metal alloy, created from carvanium, lommite, carbon, meleenium, neutronium, and zersium. It is capable of withstanding blistering heat, frigid cold, and monumental physical stress, even when very thin. Because of these properties, durasteel was used for almost everything, from smelting pots for other less hearty metals, to spacecraft hulls. Despite that, however, it could still corrode in the same manner as lesser steel alloys, and likewise requires maintenance.|
|Dwarven alloy (Elder Scrolls)|No other race has replicated whatever process was used to create dwarven metal. Although it can be easily mistaken for bronze - and in fact many forgers of dwarven materials use bronze to create their fake replicas - it is most definitely a distinct type of metal of its own.|
|Ebony (Elder Scrolls) |Raw ebony itself is an extremely hard, durable, black glass-like substance, said to be the crystalized blood of the gods.|
Element Zero/eezo *(Mass Effect universe)*|Atomic Number 0, Chemical Symbol Ez. A rare material that, when subjected to an electrical current, releases dark energy which can be manipulated into a mass effect field, raising or lowering the mass of all objects within that field. A positive current increases mass, a negative current decreases it. This ""mass effect"" is used in countless ways, from generating artificial gravity to manufacturing high-strength construction materials. It is most prominently used to enable faster-than-light space travel without causing time dilation.|
Karach/Chaos Matter *(Dungeons and Dragons universe)*|A material that can change it's shape, hardness, and sharpness based on the wielder's concentration. It is said that in the hands of a supremely focused swordsman, it can become the sharpest blade in the universe.|
Katchin/Klangite *(Dragon Ball Z Universe)*|A material said to be the strongest metal in the universe. Strong enough to break the sacred Z Sword, and heavy enough for Goku to have trouble lifting it. According to a *Groundbreaking Science* article, ""Katchin Can Be Cut"", and thus is not unbreakable.|
Mithril *(Lord of the Rings universe)*|A silvery metal that is stronger than steel but much lighter in weight. The name mithril comes from two words in Sindarin—""mith"", meaning ""grey"" or ""mist"", and ""ril"" meaning ""glitter"". Mithril can be beaten like copper and polished like glass. It is as beautiful as silver but will never tarnish. It is implied by Gandalf that only Dwarves can forge it properly. (verification/elaboration requested)|
Neosteel *(Starcraft universe)*|An extremely durable metal generally used for battle cruisers and armor reinforcement. Able to withstand faster-than-light speeds. |
Nth Metal *(main DC timeline)*|An alien metal from planet Thanagar. Ability to negate gravity, protects the wearer from the elements and speeds the healing of wounds, increases their strength, and protects them from extremes in temperature. May bestow magical abilities under some circumstances. Most notably used by Hawkman and Hawkgirl.|
Phrik *(Star Wars universe)*|One of only a few lightsaber-resistant substances known. Used in the construction of extremely light and durable battle armor as well as melee weapons. On a more extreme scale, at one point in the Galactic Civil War, a container of phrik was able to stay intact when it was on the surface of Alderaan during its destruction.|
Rearden Metal *(Atlas Shrugged universe)*|A green-blue metal that is lighter and stronger than steel. It is compared to steel as steel is to iron. |
Scrith *(Ringworld universe)*|A milky-gray translucent, nearly frictionless material. Most likely an artificial metal created through transmutation. The fairly thin layer of scrith that forms the floor of the Ringworld blocks the passage of 40% of the neutrinos that encounter it, equivalent to almost a light year of lead. It also absorbs nearly 100% of all other radiation and subatomic particles and rapidly dissipates heat. The tensile strength of scrith is similar to the strong nuclear force, with the Ringworld foundation only about 30m (100 ft) deep. Also, it is transparent to large magnetic fields. Impervious to most weapons. A body (such as a comet or asteroid) striking with enough kinetic energy may be able to deform the Ringworld floor and punch a hole. |
Sky-iron *(The Golden Compass universe)*|A type of meteoric iron that armored bears or Panserbjørne used to create their armor. Wearers tend to develop a spiritual connection to their armor. (The info says ""armour"" over and over but it's not pronounced ""ar-moor"" so I can't stand spelling it that way.)|
Ultimate Adamantium *(Marvel Earth 1610 universe)* |Not nearly as durable as mainstream admantium, and can be broken, but is still vastly stronger than most conventional metals. Unlike its mainstream counterpart, it is highly useful in blocking telepathic assaults.|
Unobtanium *(James Cameron's Avatar universe)*|An extremely expensive room-temperature superconductor for energy. Unobtanium proved to be the most baffling of scientific discoveries in the area of superconductors as it had an extremely strong magnetic field, reversing prior knowledge that all superconductors repel magnetic fields. Furthermore, unlike the fragile crystals of human-created superconducting compounds, the substance found on Pandora was a stable quasi-crystal with its atoms arranged in a never-repeating but orderly pattern with fivefold symmetry. This structure was not only structurally rugged but also has microscopic voids in the quasicrystalline structure that contain the magnetic flux lines. Unobtanium has a unique magnetic field and properties of superconductivity, causing it to levitate in magnetic fields under the Meissner Effect. |
Uru *(main Marvel timeline)*|A highly durable, mystical Asgardian ore that is both stone and metal and has vast magical potential. Primarily used to forge weapons for the Gods of Asgard. (Best known for being used to forge Thor's hammer, Mjolnir.) Uru is formed from the core of a dying star, can only be forged in the heat of a star or an Asgardian forge, and weighs over a trillion times more than an equal quantity of lead. While not easily enchanted, uru absorbs magic like a sponge, redirecting it and enhancing the natural attributes of his wielder. The enchanting process also dramatically increases its durability. In the hands of a mystic wielder, uru's properties can change depending on the magic applied to it, generally becoming stronger and denser as it's wielder commands. While not indestructible, uru makes extremely powerful weapons whether magically enhanced or not.|
Valorium *(main DC timeline)*|A type of Nth Metal used by the Legion of Super Heroes in the form of flight rings.|
Valyrian Steel/Dragonsteel *(Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice and Fire)*|A magical alloy invented in Valyria and used to make weapons of unparalleled quality. It is the spells and magic that make the steel special. Valyrian steel blades are lighter, stronger, and sharper than even the best castle-forged steel, and feature distinctive rippled patterns similar to Damascus steel. Only the greatest weaponsmiths can reforge swords from existing Valyrian steel, but the secret of creating such an alloy was apparently lost with Valyria, making those remaining weapons highly treasured and extremely rare. Most Valyrian steel blades in Westeros are treasured heirlooms of noble houses.|
Wakandan Vibranium *(main Marvel timeline)*|Native to the country of Wakanda, but believed to be of extraterrestrial origin. Ability to absorb all vibrations in the vicinity as well as kinetic energy directed at it. The energy absorbed is stored within the bonds between the molecules that make up the substance. As a result, the more energy vibranium absorbs, the tougher it becomes. There are limits to the capacity of the energy that can be stored, and vibranium can be destroyed with sufficient immediate force. Most notably used by Black Panther.|

Assuming that all the traps are designed to stop whomever you choose, who do you choose to clear the building?	Roflmoo	73	7	165	"No matter which hero or villain you choose, **they can't be from the DC, Marvel, Naruto, or DBZ universes,** they can't destroy the building, they have to find and stop the three villains, but they also must survive all the traps along the way. 

No matter who you choose, they must enter from the ground floor and clear the building of all enemies (not all traps, just the ones they trigger). The three villains can move freely through the building, but will eventually retreat to the top floor or roof if their opponent makes it to that high.

The building is surrounded by choppers and crowds. Destroying the building is not an option. 

Each villain has an unknown number of goons. Your character must complete the mission alone. Exceptions can be made for choices like Mulder and Scully, J and K, or Sam and Dean Winchester.

Loophole closings:

No psychics. Obviously, this would be boring if the bad guys all just walked out and surrendered under mind control. 

No breaking the scenario. Don't pick a character that can unmake reality or magically change the situation. Come on. That's lame.

Remember, no matter who you choose, the traps in the building are specifically designed to stop them. If you were able to choose Superman, all the weapons would have kryptonite or magic. Got it? Good.

The traps are also designed to stop upward momentum through the building, but once inside, it is to be assumed that your hero/villain can't leave until death or completion."	t5_2s599	True

1371850054.0	1gtjbb	Luke Skywalker (Original Trilogy) vs General Grievous (The Clone Wars Animated)	Zankman	70	10	59	"***Who Would Win?***

**Fighters:**

 * **Luke Skywalker** as he is seen in the Original Trilogy; to be exact, the version of him would be the same one that we see at the end of [Episode VI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_VI:_Return_of_the_Jedi), with the difference that he is rested and at full health.

 **IMPORTANT EDIT:** Although it *is* Episode VI Luke, let's have in mind that he is more agile (jumping and running and such) than he was in the movie; the movie is obviously old and not a lot of CG was used, and as we know, in Episodes 1 through 3, we can see that the Jedi are *very* athletic; this was done since technology didn't limit the filmmakers. 

 Since this is considered canon, let us apply that to Luke as well; basically, he can do some acrobatics.


 * **General Grievous** as he is seen in the [2003 2D TV show, Clone Wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Clone_Wars_(2003_TV_series)); To be exact, he has **NOT** had his chest crushed by Mace Windu; he is at optimal function and health. 

**Location:** 

* **Forest Moon of Endor**; somewhere in the forest, there is a bunker, much like the one in Episode 6 that acts as the Death Star's Shield Generator. 

* The encounter happens **in front** of the bunker, on the outside.

**Equipment:**

 * Luke has his **Lightsaber** (the one with the Green Crystal), an **average ""pistol-type"" Blaster** and (as a special addition) a **Flashbang grenade**. 

 * Grievous has **8 Lightsabers** (as per usual?) attached to his ""belt"".

 * There is a **Speedbike** (as seen in Episode VI) which Luke used to get around the Forest. He left it near the entrance, deactivated, of course.

**State of mind:** 

 * Luke is in a **Normal** state of mind (he is his regular self); This would mean **calm, benevolent, patient and level-headed**.

 Potential to be **naive, angry and enraged/bloodlusted (to a minor degree)**.

 * Grievous is in a **Normal** state of mind (he is his regular self); This would mean **cold, calculated, malevolent/hateful, merciless, brutal and arrogant**.

 Potential to be **enraged/bloodlusted, cowardly and reckless; may show pity, but he wouldn't spare Luke's life**. 


 * Both are **quite intelligent and tactical**. 

 * **Special Note**: Grievous' Anger and Hatred were artificially augmented during his reconstruction; Besides that, they are both additionally intensified when Grievous faces any **Jedi**.

**Original and New Goals:**

* **Luke's Original Goal**: Luke was on Endor after the destruction of the Death Star in Episode VI decided to wander around for a bit. Found a bunker and decided to enter it. Upon some inspection, exited it and was about to go back to the Ewok village.

 * **Luke's New Goal**: Interact with the mechanical being; react accordingly --&gt; Defend himself, if need be kill his attacker OR try to flee *somewhere*.

* **Grievous' Original Goal**: Grievous opened his eyes to find himself in a random and unknown forest. He wandered around until he found a bunker, and went towards it. Besides that, his standard goal of ""Defeat The Republic and kill the Jedi"" remains in mind.

 * **Grievous' New Goal**: Interogate the human for information; react accordingly --&gt; KILL THE FILTHY JEDI SCUM!

**Special Notes:**

 * Luke is obviously a **Jedi** with access to the **Force**; for more info, read about him [here](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Luke_Skywalker). Keep in mind that this in this fight we are basically talking about Episode VI Luke, right after he fought Vader and Sidious died.
 
  * As a Jedi, he is obviously beyond-Human and proficient with a Lightsaber.

    
  * As the son of the Chosen One Anakin Skywalker, possesses great natural Force power within him and an affinity to be a great duelist; relevant to this fight, he is proficient and basically uses the [Form V](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Form_V:_Shien_/_Djem_So) of the Lightsaber combat forms. Basically: *Form V combat was characterized by power attacks and defense immediately followed by a counter-strike.*


 * Grievous is a **cyborg** with a powerful **mechanical body**, for more info read about him [here](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Grievous). His mechanical body most notably allowed him to have 4 arms if need be, great maneuverability along with great strength and agility. 

  * His only organic parts, eyes, brain, heart (and lungs?) are protected by his armor. 

 
  * Was trained by **Count Dooku** at Lightsaber combat until ""he could not be taught no more"". Developed a unique style and unorthodox style which sums up to: *...prolonged lightning-fast flurries and power moves designed to overwhelm his enemies.**

  * Does *not* have the ability to use the Force in any way.

 * More about the combat abilities of [Luke](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Luke_Skywalker#Powers_and_abilities) and [Grievous](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Luke_Skywalker#Powers_and_abilities).


Final thoughts: 

 * This is my first fight that I have ever posted here! There is a lot of text, but I hope that you can bare with me. I just wanted it to be informative, exact and interesting.

 * [Luke Skywalker](http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120612164423/starwars/images/4/43/PrereleaseMindorCoverArt.jpg) and [General Grievous](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20080817041961/starwars/images/c/ce/GrievousRevealed.jpg).

After a lengthy debate inspired by the thread about the 151 Pokemon vs. 1 Billion lions (I reckon the 'mon), I got to wondering if there was at all a single individual who can defeat all of them when faced at once? 

Then I realised, of course. Doctor Manhattan, Super Man Prime 1 Million, VERY angry Hulk and Batman with prep time could all probably destroy them one-on-one.

So, I want to know who the weakest character is who can fight them all at once and win? I excluded Mew and Mew-Two because I figured there may be at least ONE non-uber tier character who can win, but IF there is a general consensus that it would take a OP character to fight them, I'll allow them in to the fray.

All vehicles are being driven by dock workers with two years experience of material handling. They will function as teams in their respective weight class and each driver has a radio. 

No driver may leave his vehicle or use anything other than what comes standard on the machine.

The battle space is a paved lot two km square. It is flat and has no obstructions at all. The winning team has to disable all opposing vehicles. The weather is fine and it is day time.

Who would win?

Edit:

The twenties spoke on their closed radio channel and came up with a plan. They stuck together and spun around in tight circles, the smaller forklifts could not approach so held off. After the twenty drivers got dizzy they formed a tight line and charged the main body of three point fives.

Six of the smaller forks are disabled during first contact, all of the drivers are killed. While the twenties are occupied the remaining threepoint fives flank the line and manage to smash the cabs of the two on the end with raised tines. Two twenties reverse out of the line and sweep the smaller forks off the sides of their fallen brethren.

Another twenty becomes disabled during this action after lodging half a forklift under its front tyres.

The remaining two large forklifts regroup and chase down the smaller machines. There are no survivors.

Gary the dockworker stands on some shipping containers and sees the final forklift get crushed. He has watched with glee, and thinks about the last few weeks. About the winning lottery ticket and the frantic organisation that went into the battle of his dreams.

He hears sirens in the distance and thinks, best fifty million I ever spent.

1372379052.0	1h7s4d	Sci-Fi Universe Tier List	A_Waskawy_Wabit	61	9	196	"**Intro and list:**

Due to the large amount of Science fiction universes being pitted against each other I'm going to try to create a very basic tier list to help show which universes could beat different universes without any sort of limitations.  I'm not trying to discourage people asking which universe would win I'm simply trying to help people assign he correct advantages/ disadvantages to have interesting fights.  Anyway, without further ado here is the list in its simplest form:

1. Dr. Who Universe
2. The Culture
3. Warhammer 40k
4. Star Wars
5. Transformers
6. Halo
7. Mass Effect
8. Starcraft
9. BattleStar Galactica

Now I realize that there are a lot of universes not mentioned here these are just the ones that get mentioned the most on this subreddit.  If you want another universe added just tell me maybe link a wiki page that could tell me about ship strengths and numbers so I could accurately list it.

**Each Universe:**

The following will be a breakdown of what each universes' main strengths are and why I have listed them in the order they are listed.  For multi-factioned Universes I will break them down and rank them where appropriate.

**The Dr. Who Universe:**

The reason that the Dr. Who Universe is number is due to the scale of the Time War.  In this universe two factions with control over time went to war.  This war was long and brutal and lasted from simple years to millenia based on perspective.  In this war people were resurrected by replaying battles over and over by each side to ensure their side won.  They raised entire cultures over millenia just to have them sacrificed because of how huge this war was.  When it was finally over the docter described the ""*final days of the war as ""hell"", with ""the Skaro Degradations, the Horde of Travesties, the Nightmare Child, the Could-Have-Been King with his army of Meanwhiles and Never-Weres"" constituting particularly disturbing developments*"" Meaning that some of the smartest minds in the galaxy may or may not have participated due to how screwed up the timeline got.  Basically any universe that does not have access to time travel will never even have existed if they challenge this one

**The Culture:**

I admit this is the universe I am least familiar with and appears least frequently here I am including it on reputation alone and the fact that people who know about it unanimously believe it could beat the 40k universe easily.

[Here is a great writeup](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1h7s4d/scifi_universe_tier_list/carpwsw) done by /u/OlafTheSpaceViking

**Warhammer 40k:**

Warhammer 40k is a universe about Humanity in the year 40,000.  That means it is 3,750 years ahead of the next universe which is based off explicitly Human characters.  The 40k universe is ranked at #2 because one of the weakest contenders in this universe (the Imperium of man) still owns hundreds of planets which have millions of ships filled with soldiers using technology tens of thousands of years ahead of us.  Not to mention the Space Marines which are genetically enhanced super soldiers which could win against Master Chief in a 1v1 fight.  The 40k universe is one of constant death and danger where gods of chaos constantly try to kill off everything.

Basically life sucks, there's only war and you're probably going to be eaten by Tyrannids.

**Star Wars:**

The Star Wars universe is one of the most iconic universes in the entire Sci-Fi genre.  It is a universe where planets can be blown up by multiple weapons and is a universe where being of immense power rule.  The reason that it is third place on the list is pretty much that George Lucas didn't really care about accuracy when creating it and decided to add several zeroes to the end of all the power numbers.  Couple that with Dark Master who can destroy fleets in seconds and others who can absorb planets for power and you have a universe where not matter what time period you enter it will kick some serious other-planetary ass

**Transformers:**

A universe made up of ancient robotic beings.  They are very powerful and durable all of which can transform into various vehicles.  They are also capable of reaching gargantuan sizes some being the size of spacecrafts and some being entire cities.  There is also the technology to immediately teleport across huge amounts of space as well as a god who can eat stars and has only been killed with fragments of a god.

**Halo:**

Halo is a very interesting universe with 3 or more factions vying for power at all times.  To help show how powerful each faction is I shall do a breakdown each faction.

Forruners: The Forerunners are a very interesting race because they are the most advanced race to ever exist within the Halo universe and are on the Warhammer 40k level of power.  When they realized that their species was doomed they were able to create no less than 7 super-weapons each capable of annihilating all life within the galaxy.  They also created several artificial planets and are some of the most powerful being ever anywhere.  

Another point for Forereunner are the precursors [here is a great comment explaining both their power levels and that of the Forerunners](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1h7s4d/scifi_universe_tier_list/carrfs9)

Humans (UNSC): Humans have actually had two stages however most information comes from the second so that is where it will be focused on.  The Humans are a strong race which prefer to use kinetic and bullet based weapons to deal their damage.  Each of their main ships are equipped with Nukes as well as MAC's which are cannons capably of accelerating their payload close to lightspeed to do serious damage.  They also train SPARTANS which are elite modified troops who's armor is comparable to that Forerunners had.  Couple that with their unbreakable bones, ability to lift half a ton, and 4 second reaction speeds they are able to beat almost anything in any universe in a 1v1 fight.

Convenant: The covenant are collection of species brought together under the prophets to complete the great journey.  They use plasma based weapons which are adapted from Forerunner technology.  Their ships are so strong it was considered a fair fight when the UNSC had a 3 to 1 advantage

Flood:  The Flood are a parasite capable of wiping out entire species.  They are arguably the strongest faction in the Halo universe as they control multiple galaxies however in the only explored one they are a smaller albeit deadly threat.  The Flood is a virus which will spread to sentient life taking over the bodies and attempting to spread more.  They can use weapons and pilot ships as well as being very resistant to the effects of space/ vacuum.  They can also infect dead bodies meaning that in fights when their enemies are dead they can take over the deceased bodies.

**Mass Effect:**

Mass Effect is a universe controlled by reapers sentient ships which wipe out the galaxy every 50,000 years.  The Mass effect universe also has two factions which are in very basic terms Humanity and the Reapers.

Humanity: Humans and their allies are based in the year 23rd century where they discovery of Mass Relays allowed for instant teleportation across the galaxy.  The weapons in this universe are also very advanced and are in fact much better than those of the Halo universe.    They also have Biotics which is very similar to The Force.  Biotics have very unclear rules however it is a huge bonus in combat situations.  

The reason that they are below Halo is that while the weapons are much stronger the ship to ship combat is much more even and the Covenant forces would easily beat Humanity in Mass Effect

Reapers:  The Reapers are very advanced ships which are hundreds of thousands of years old.  They purge the galaxy every 50,000 years and are immune to the effects of age.  They use laser based weapons however they are not very mobile as when they go FTL they lost their shields meaning in high action fights they will have difficulty re-positioning.  Regardless they are one of the strongest forces in any Universe only ranking below Halo because of the Forerunners.

**Starcraft:**

Starcraft is unfortunately one of the weakest of these universes however they are still very capable of fighting.  They are divided into three main factions of:

Protoss, an ancient species that has mastered teleportation and has amazing shields.  They also have great telekinetic and telepathic abilities where on of their more elite troops could take out a Jedi Knight.  They also have access to large amounts of stealth technology

Terran: Essentially humans in this universe which mainly use ammunition and bullet based weapons

Zerg: A strange species which goes through very rapid evolution and communicates telepathically with one another and who's leader has access to some very strong telepathic abilities and very strong telekinesis.

**BattleStar Galactica:**

The BSG universe is comprised of 2 main factions. Aside from FTL drives, Artificial Gravity, and advance space propulsion the BSG universe is barely ahead of our own current technology.

12 Colonies of Kobol Formed after the first Cylon war nearly destroyed humanity. Purposfully has denetworked and brought technolgy backwards in order to defend against superior Cylon computer hacking. Uses brute force and firepower in their ship design. Battlestars are tough ships but ultimatly out of their league when taking on most other universes with very weak nuclear weapons being main armerments. Colonial FTL drives however, can give great tactical advantages if used correctly and Vipers are just about the most manueverable fighters in any universe.

Cylons similar to the colonials in technology. The Cylons have far more advance computers and FTL drives and do have a very powerful advantage in ressurection technology. Cylon culture seems to be very mobile as thier home is a massive star station capable of FTL jumps. Cylon warships however, are not very strong and rely on large amounts of raiders. Cylon raiders all are equiped with FTL drives and are capable of resurecting if destroyed. Cylons may have a chance against an oponent if they can use their very mobile culture and resurection technology to learn the weakness of their foes. 

(*thanks to /u/dracomarine*)

**Conclusion:**

As I said before if there are any questions or other universes that ought to be added just comment or message me and I will do my best to update this when I can.  I hope you all enjoy this and use it to make sure that the fights can be as close as possible.  If I have any incorrect information please tell me preferably with evidence to why I am wrong and I will fix it as soon as possible

**Additional Universes:**

Here is where I will be listing any additional universes I still need to add if anyone has spare time feel free to give a suggested position and an explanation why to make my life easier.

1. Stargate - After reviewing Stargate it seems that is is only a tv series meaning that there are not enough numbers to accurately understand their power without me watching everything.  If anyone who has watched it wants to help me out that would be great but otherwise I won't be able to rank them
2. Starship Troopers
3. ~~BattleStar Galactica~~ Done!
4. Futurama (maybe)
5. ~~Transformers~~ Done!
6. ~~Dr. Who universe~~ Done!
7. Babylon 5
8. ~~Ender's game~~ I would really love to add Ender's game to this however it is a book based around philosophy not action.  The only weapon we know about is the Dr. Device and we don't know even what the field radius equation is
9. Star Trek

Please see the [Batman Data Survey](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1gta5i/batman_data_survey/) to help complete this post properly. 

Alright, just like the [5(ish) Rules of Hulk](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1gqozb/the_5ish_rules_of_hulk/) post, this one is just the tester to make sure the rules work and are correct. I'll make a permanent one later that's all nice and pretty. This one ain't that. This is a rough draft off the top of my head. We can add or remove rules as needed. 

If you have something to add or a fighter who can win without these rules, let me know so I can fix things. Also, if you have a fighter or two that can be used as examples of a rule or rules being used to beat Batman, suggest them and tell me what you know about the fight.

##The 5 Rules of Batman

*(These almost never work when used individually. Most ""losses"" for Batman come from an enemy or enemies using multiple Rules against him at once.)*


1. If you are going to face Batman, you must sufficiently limit his time and resources available to prepare for the fight. Batman's main powers are preparation, bottomless resources, and the habit of over-preparing for highly unlikely scenarios ""just in case"". He already has plans to take out every member of the Justice League and every other superhuman he's encountered. If Batman is allowed time to prepare for a fight, and has no limits but the resources and alliances he has access to in the DC universe, he is almost inexplicably unbeatable. It's not fair, but it's the way the character is written. With the exception of truly omnipotent fighters and those who outclass Batman in every possible way, (sometimes, even then) his victory though being prepared is unfairly guaranteed because he's overly prepared for it and every possibility associated with it. (This Rule was utilized by every fighter who has ever beaten or will ever beat Batman. None of us *like* it. We just learn to accept it. So deal. Complain to DC. I don't work for them. Don't tell me how you disagree with this one anymore. I have no control over it. Stop it.) End result- give Batman no prep time and limit his resources to what he usually has on him. Make it a single round with no chance for a rematch, and Batman will lose all the battles you would expect him to. Allow him to prepare and he will win even if he has to cheat. I don't know how many other ways to say this.

2. If you are going to try to outfight Batman, you must have some combination of the following:
 
 A. Knowledge of every fighting style in the world, equal to Batman
 
 B. Superior strength, size, endurance, and/or speed, (having only one is not a guaranteed victory)

 C. Possession of a hidden weapon or ability that Batman couldn't possibly know about, 

 D. The element of surprise, and/or

 E. Insider knowledge of his fighting style. 

3. If you are going to try to out-think Batman, you must be capable of out-obsessing Batman when it comes to details, and you probably need to be well beyond the limits of a super-genius. 

4. If you are going to out-tech Batman, you must have access to technology far beyond anything shown in the DC universe, or somehow remove Batman's tech from the equation entirely.

5. Other than those, Batman can only be beaten by forcing him into a moral trap. A trick situation where he has to choose between victory and saving others, or a Xanatos Gambit where there *is* no way to win.

___

##List of evidence

Bane broke Batman's back through use of Rules 1 and 2. There may have also been uses of others, I don't know Bane as well as I should.

Joker has beaten Batman through use of Rules 1, 3, 4, and 5, but has also attempted each and failed more often that he's succeeded.

Research and prep will only help if you can gather information on your enemy. In the DCU (for instance) there are only a handful of places to get data on the JLA and pretty much all of them are going to at least potentially tip off the researcher's target.

Kryptonite is common knowledge OOC, but not in universe. Same with Martian Manhunter and fire or the fact that Wonder Woman loses her powers if you handcuff her.

Same goes for other settings.

The Doctor has an insane amount of power and has been shown on multiple occasions to be able to simply ignore some physical laws such as gravity. He can travel through time and, theoretically, beat almost anyone by going back and preventing said thing from existing (I know this is not always the case as with fixed points and all, but this is often spoken of as a power of his).

The reason he doesn't always win is pretty much because he holds himself back. Unless he really has to do it to prevent a species from dying or some similar threat, he won't resort to any kind of violence and will try to simply disarm any weapons and leave. Also, almost every time he arrives at some point in time where there's a problem, he stays there until it is solved. He rarely (and I say rarely simply to be safe as I don't know every single episode, but from what I know, I'd actually say never) travels in time *during* a confrontation, he only does it in between his confrontations.

The same, in proportion, happens to Superman. What tends to make him weaker is that he doesn't want to kill and thus holds himself back as well."	t5_2s599	True

I will be doing a re-write here if I can get enough data to fix it, but in the meantime it's still an interesting read that a lot of you have enjoyed. Just keep in mind it means absolutely nothing at the moment.

*(Before we begin, I have to note that I'm not a physicist. I'm not even terribly good at math, so some of this might be a little off. If anyone knows better than I do, please let me know and I can adjust what I have.)* 

##For the TL;DR, scroll to the bottom.

Let's face it- Hulk comes up a lot. Generally, we'll just say Hulk wins if he has enough time to get mad enough and strong enough to beat his opponent, no matter who he faces. Well, that's kind of cool, but it doesn't really satisfy, does it? Especially when you take into account [Stan Lee's claim](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEgIfpb5NHY) (and comic book history) that Thor was created specifically to be stronger than the Hulk. That video also brings up the (somewhat tongue-in-cheek) history that Marvel and Stan Lee have, where they are known for taking great pains trying to explain powers in as scientific a way as possible. (Though Stan Lee has also said the one thing he never could explain was how Hulk's pants still fit after he transforms.)

Now it's true there are many versions of the Hulk and they all have varying levels of power, but I think that, by the end of this, we might have a better idea of what the Hulk's actual potential limits really are. Yes, they will change from version to version, but we will know a vague idea of how much and why. So let's get started.

---
It's important to remember that Hulk's strength can be roughly estimated by using his mass. If we can determine his maximum density, we can approximate an upper range for his potential strength.

Let's start with size and mass. This one has been explored before on [this website](http://fanon.wikia.com/wiki/Science_of_the_Incredible_Hulk), among others. Basically, it says that Hulk's mass is directly derived from quantum particles that appear, collide, and disappear every nanosecond, and his body's absorption rate of these particles is tied to the rage centers of his brain. 

Okay, so Hulk's mass, and therefore strength/durability, is limited by his rage, and his rage allows his body to correctly harness those particles. Therefore, we can guess that Hulk's maximum mass is directly linked to these quantum particles. Great, but what does that tell us about his actual limits? We can see his body's dimensions in relation to his height, but how tall is his maximum height?

Hulk generally doesn't get much bigger than 10 ft. In fact, I'm having a very difficult time finding any credible numbers on his real size limits. However, even if we can't agree on his height, I'll use 10 feet because it should be easy to extrapolate more numbers from the following figures.

Hulk's potential mass is limited by the amount of quantum particles that could fit in the space he occupies. It's illogical to say his mass is potentially indefinite, even if he were capable of maintaining an ever-increasing rage, if he has a maximum size. Since we have never seen the Hulk get very large, there is logically a limit to his size. 

**This limit is crucial to determining Hulk's maximum potential.**


Okay, to recap, we know Hulk's strength is related to his mass. His mass can be determined (very roughly, remember) based on his maximum height and body dimensions. If we assume Hulk's maximum height is 10 feet for this equation, then all we need to know is how many quantum particles could fit into his frame while still allowing him to move. If we completely filled his frame, he would be about as dense as a black hole, which we know is impossible, as his gravity hasn't devoured our solar system. That brings up the next issue. 

While looking at Hulk's mass, we have to remember the relationship between mass and gravity. The more mass something has, the more gravitational pull it generates. Since some of the Marvel universe breaks this rule, (Thor's hammer Mjolnir comes to mind, as well as Onslaught's armor,) we can assume a somewhat illogical margin of error and round up. 

Hulk's potential mass can be guessed based on the fact that nothing orbits him while he is on Earth. Therefore, it's safe to assume his mass is less than that of the Earth, thus allowing Earth's gravitational pull to override his own. We can also guess (remember, I'm not a physicist, so this isn't definitive) that his mass is significantly less than that of the Earth, because his gravity doesn't ever influence the Earth's orbit or rotation. Even the Moon impacts Earth's orbit and rotation, but it happens slowly and steadily, while Hulk only exists as the Hulk briefly, sporadically, and is always moving when he's around. We can safely assume that, while he might be capable of possessing mass large enough to potentially cause problems with the Earth's orbit and rotation, he never has it long enough or applies it properly enough to actually impact anything. This means that his peak range is likely to be somewhere between that of the Earth and that of the Moon.

The moon's mass is 7.34767309 × 10^22 kilograms.

The mass of the Earth is 5.97219 × 10^24 kilograms.


So, to really really oversimplify things, the moon exerts the gravitational force of about 1.622 m/s², (meters per second squared) and the Earth exerts 9.78 m/s². To put that in perspective, the average human exerts only 4.34 nm/s^2. (That's nano meters per second squared.)

Whatever. This isn't a math class. Anyway, we can use this information to guess that Hulk has roughly 2 to 8 m/s^2 gravitational force.

Since we established above that his mass can't be too close to that of the Earth, let's settle on a nice even 5 m/s^2. That way, the end numbers will be easier to determine. We know these are all rough calculations, so forgive me for the inevitable large margin of error, here.

Okay. So. If Hulk's exerting gravity equal to 5 m/s^2, and he's 3.048 meters tall, we can begin to guess at his density, and from there, determine his strength. (Since we're using some equations now, I'll be using metrics for a little. Bear with me my fellow Americans). 

Now all we need to do is decide on how much space a 3.048 meter tall Hulk would occupy: his volume. Problem? We can't really. So, I offer the next best thing. Let's start with an average human.

An average individual's weight is around 70 kg (154.324 lbs), which gives an approximate body volume of 

V=m/M = 70/1000 = 0.07 cubic meters.

In other words, a 150-ish pound human would take up about 70 liters of space. Still with me? Good.  

Hulk is by no means a normal human, but taking his height and estimating his size from comics, (and remembering that the comic book physics allow us to round up) we can say that **Hulk's volume is somewhere in the area of 10 cubic meters** (10,000 cubic liters). For a comparison, look up pictures of 10,000 liter water tanks. Most large cement mixers also hold around this amount.


But remember, the Hulk is denser than water, and denser than cement. Now we have everything we need. 

Density is mass divided by volume, or 

d= m/v

We know the volume,so we know 

d=m/10^3 m

Now we need to find Hulk's weight. To do this, we can use the formula 

ar^2 /G

where a is acceleration (5 m/s^2) in our case, r is the distance from the center of mass, and G is the gravitational constant. (6.67398 × 10-11 m3 kg-1 s-2)

We know the basic average of the distance from Hulk's core to his skin is around 1 meter (3.28084 ft). This is tough. He's about as wide as he is tall, but isn't quite as deep (pun not intended). The average is both a guess and an attempt to keep things as simple as possible in the math department.

So, (5 m/s^2 )x(1 m)^2 /6.67398 × 10-11 m3 kg-1 s-2

Thanks to the magic of [this web tool](http://calculator.tutorvista.com/acceleration-due-to-gravity-calculator.html), we know that Hulk's maximum weight is a slim and trim 74,933,309,354.67433 Kg. Rounding that up, we get 75 billion Kg.

Remember d=m/v? We determined that 

v= 10^3 m

and now we know that 

m= 75 billion Kg.

Therefore, 

d= 75 billion Kg/10^3 m

So Hulk's maximum density is 7,500,000,000 Kg/m^3.


That was a lot of work to come up with a number like that and have nothing to show for it! What does that even mean?!

I'll tell you. 

It means that every square meter of the Hulk weighs 7.5 billion killograms, or well over 16.5 billion pounds.

---

Okay. We did all that math for this.

Knowing Hulk's density, we can determine how much damage he can take and how much he can lift. He can only lift as much as his body can withstand. (Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.) 

So now we need to look at the kind of force Hulk's body can take. What sort of attacks really damage him?


We know Hulk has withstood the mightiest of Marvel's heroes. In World War Hulk, the one to finally bring Hulk to such a state of exhaustion that he turned back into Bruce Banner was The Sentry. Before the battle, The Sentry admits to his fear of his tremendous power, stating,

""Against an opponent this powerful...The amount of energy I'd have to expend...if I...lost control, for even a millisecond...""
—Sentry

This means that it's safe to assume The Sentry used very close to his full power when fighting the Hulk. This is good for us, because if we can calculate The Sentry's maximum damage output, we can establish what Hulk's body can withstand, and therefore, how much force he can exert.

We know The Sentry can destroy planets, but this is not easy to define, as planets are all unique, and what destroys one might not destroy another. We know The Sentry can withstand supernovae, and thus can likely emit force greater than that of an exploding star. That we can use. A supernova releases 10^44 joules of energy which is about ten octillion megatons of TNT (I'll admit that I'm cheating on this part and not actually doing/checking the math myself, please correct me if this is wrong.)

So. If The Sentry can produce greater force than that of a supernova, and Hulk technically withstood it (or very close to it) for a long enough period to tire out, and if Hulk's strength is limited by what force his body can withstand, then Hulk is able to exert the same amount of force as that generated by a supernova. 

Now, we need to figure out a way to translate 10^44 joules into an amount of weight Hulk can lift.

More to come.

##Okay, from here down, I'm using this as notes for my next attempt at this. 

 * Scaling Argument

A mammal has a size, s. 

The animal has a mass, m.

This mammal has a thighbone, a femur.

The femur carries the body, to a large extent.

The femur has a length, l.

The femur had a thickness, d.

The length is how long it is, the thickness is measured at the narrowest point.

And the cross-sectional area at measure d will be area, A.

The length of the femur must be proportional to the size of the animal. Completely plausible, as an animal four times larger than another would need four times longer legs. So 

l ∝ s

or, length is related to size.

It is also reasonable that the mass of an animal is related to it's size to the third power, because that's related to its volume. So, 

m ∝ s^3

That means, that if it's related to a third power of the size, it is also related to the third power of the femur, because of the previous point. So,

m ∝ s^3 ∝ l^3

Now, pressure on the femur is proportional to the weight of the animal divided by the cross-section A of the femur, which is proportional to the mass of the creature divided by the thickness squared.

pressure ∝ weight/A ∝ m/d^2

If the pressure is higher than a certain level, the bone will break. Therefore, for an animal not to break its bones when the mass goes up by a certain factor, let's say a factor of four, in order for the bones not to break, d^2 must also go up by a factor of four."	t5_2s599	True

After the main debate is over a an outcome is decided, I will practice my writing skills by writing out a short story of how the battle went according to the outcome that was chosen.

Here is the scenario:

The Punisher is en route to Gotham City. He will be there at 3 PM. He's heard of the Joker and seen what he's done on the news. Most recently, multiple families were killed in a gas attack at a park just outside of Gotham. Fed up with the GPD's failure to capture Joker for more than 24 hours, and Batman's unwillingness to kill Joker, Punisher decides to visit Gotham.

Little does Punisher know, Joker has Gotham on high alert. He has planted 3 bombs of unknown power throughout Gotham, and claims that starting at 6 PM, he will detonate one bomb every hour until someone, through a news network, tells him the best joke he's ever heard. Batman, of course, is busy locating Joker.

All the meanwhile, Deathstroke has been hired by an unknown person to kill Batman once and for all. He will be arriving in Gotham at 4 PM.

1375668384.0	1jpqi7	Santa Claus vs. Dracula	Anansison	47	9	33	"The Dark Lord and ol Saint Nick have been enemies for millenia.  Both were supernatural creatures of immense power but they have never directly warred , instead choosing to battle in the hearts of men.  Kringle tried to inspire hope and goodwill, whilst the Impaler hoped to unleash the destructive potential of man.  

But then a hunter named Helsing came along and Santa believed his old enemy to be vanquished.

But somehow, in this time, the King of Vampires has returned.  And this time (perhaps sensing cultures ambivalence towards vampires) he plans to engage in bloody vengeance against humanity.  Santa will not allow this.

Santa (who sees all from the North Pole) did not observe the Dark Lord soon enough to stop him from returning to full strength.  But Dracula has not yet had time to muster his armies of Darkness.

Dracula has established camp in an old mundane castle in Romania.  It is midnite and he is prepared to go out and wreak havoc in the surrounding village.  Santa rides out on his sleigh, intent on protecting the children.

With an icy swirl the doors of the castle burst open.  Dracula sits on his throne, waiting.  Two titans of folklore.  Two sorcerors of legend.  

Who wins?

EDIT: The Prince of Darkness steps down for his shadowed throne, bursts of power and swarms of bats radiating from around him.
""Are you ready to end this fat man?"" 
He descends but before he can reach his prey, Santa holds up his hand.
""One thing first Vlad.  After that we can fight all you want, but there is something you need to see.""

The vampire looks confused, perhaps for the first time.  His eyes dart back and forth, wary of fey trickery.
""I don't know what elvish deceits you have cooked up old man but.....""

Santa ignores him, continuing to rummage through his giant red bag.  He talks to himself quietly as he feels around the sack, oblivious to the creature of darkness before him.  With an exclamation of joy he seizes his hand upon what he was looking for.  With a chuckle in his belly and a twinkle in his eye he pulls out.... a wrapped present..... addressed to Vlad of Wallachia...... from Santa.

The aura of darkness fades from Dracula.  A present?  He hasn't received a present since he was mortal.  He looks Santa in the eye, searching for meaning.  The old man merely chuckles again and extends his hand forward, beckoning for the other to take it.

Dracula grabs the gift and unwraps it.  At first his eyes flash in confusion, then anger...... then sadness.  A crimson tear wells up in one eye, unnoticed.  He brings the gift to chest and holds it as though it will ignite his long defunct heart.

Santa lightly taps him on the jaw with his fist, as he would to a small boy.

""Merry Christmas Vlad.""

Dracula looks at him shaken.  ""B-ut.... its August?""

Santa lets out a massive ""Ho Ho Ho!"" his entire body shaking with mirth.
""Don't you know that wherever Santa is, it's Christmas.""

And with that he slings his massive red sack over his shoulder, and leaves the Castle shutting the door behind him.

Dracula is left standing in the middle, broken and DEFEATED.  In the distance he hears the ringing of sleigh bells.

Songbird's final screech howled through the underwater dystopia as Booker trembled, shaken by the creature's death and Elizabeth's new power.

""There you go..."" Elizabeth cooed as the corpse of her only friend sunk to the inky black depths. Booker glanced nervously at her, making sure she was okay. ""Elizabeth- I'm sorry..."" She didn't respond, and a slow jazz song began wafting through the air. He looked around, seeing the classy yet ruined interior of this underwater building. ""What is this place? Elizabeth...?"" 

""A doorway... One of many."" She replied absently. Elizabeth walked down a finely-carpeted hallway, heading to a thick metal door. ""What do you mean, 'a doorway'? What is this place?"" Booker asked breathlessly. ""Where are you going?!"" 

""Yes, it's this way!"" Elizabeth said excitedly. The former Pinkerton was about to say something when she shouted from across the hall. ""Down here!"" He followed her down a hallway, past a neon sign that said 'Rapture Metro'. The corridor resemble a hotel lobby, but the small fires, leaking pipes, and rubble suggested that some terrible disaster had occurred not long ago.

""This way!"" she urged, sprinting around a corner. Just then, a scream rang out. Booker's eyes darted around the room, looking for the source. 'It sounded like a young girl' he thought. Just then, he caught movement through one of the dirty windows. He squinted through the tarnished glass, and what he saw horrified him.

A haggard-looking man wearing a blood-stained sweater was looming over a little girl menacingly. Booker noticed that the man was holding a shotgun in one hand, and his other hand was encased in ice. There was also a giant metal figure lying dead behind him. The monster gave Booker a lurching sense of Déjà Vú.

The little girl started sobbing as she crouched near the metal figure, failing to notice the man walking towards her. ""Mister Bubbles? MISTER B?!"" The girl wailed. ""Hey, get away from the girl, you son of a bitch!"" Booker shouted. The other man sneered as he grabbed the child. ""HEY! LET HER GO!"" He shouted.

""Booker, we have to go!"" Elizabeth urged. 

""Elizabeth, if I don't open that door, that little girl is going to die!""

Seeing that he wasn't going to back down, she sighed. ""Normally, I wouldn't want you to, but that man is a monster. But Jack's powerful. You're going to want this."" Her eyes started glowing and Booker felt charges of power raging through his body. 
""There. Now you won't run out of salts. For a while, at least...""

Booker nodded. ""Thanks."" He turned around, unclasping the Skyhook from his belt. ""Alright, you bastard, you asked for it"" he growled. He started spinning the blades, pulled his arm back, and punched through the reinforced glass.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Jack jumped back, shielding his face from the glass shards. Booker pulled out a hand cannon and readied a Feast of Crows. Jack eyed his wrist. ""Plasmids? Good. You must have some ADAM on you!"" he hissed. 

""Adam? Who's that?"" Booker replied, confused. Jack looked at him hungrily, sizing him up. Normally, Booker's unshakable demeanor an guns scared off anyone looking to start trouble, but the promise of ADAM dissolved any fear Jack might've had. 

Jack launched a Winter Blast before Booker had time to say anything. He pulled out his wrench and started bludgeoning the frozen statue, smashing large cracks into the ice. Before he could shatter it, though, Booker melted his Arctic prison with a Devil's Kiss, caught Jack's wrench, and launched it across the room. Jack snarled and pulled out a Machine Gun, shattering Booker's durable shield and grazing his arm. 

Booker fired his Burstgun and dove behind cover as his mind raced, thinking about what he should do next. Using Undertow would probably flood the entire city, so that was out of the question. Elizabeth was nowhere to be found, so he had limited ammo. If he ran out of bullets, though, he could just use Vigors.

His thought process was interrupted as an RPG landed a few feet in front of him. Instinct took over as he combat rolled out of the way, firing his Hand Cannon. 

""Are you fucking crazy?! Launching an explosive in an underwater city?!"" 

Jack was obviously not all there, mentally speaking. Booker used Bucking Bronco to launch the maniac into the air and Charged into him, launching them both into another room. Booker scrambled to his feet, preparing to finish off the madman. Just then, he heard an electronic beep and turned around, only to see that he had landed in front of an RPG turret. Jack instinctively launched a Security Bullseye at Booker, who used Possession against the machine, which short-circuited and burst into flame.

Jack, feeling lightheaded from the Plasmid use, injected himself with an EVE Hypo. Booker recoiled in disgust. ""Drugs, huh? That's why you're crazy as shit?"" Jack glared at him and summoned an Insect Swarm to put some distance between them. Booker swore as he was covered in dozens of burning stings, and called upon his Feast of Crows, who hungrily devoured the wasps. Jack, remembering the Bucking Bronco from earlier, sucking  Booker in a Cyclone Trap, mirthfully setting him ablaze with Incinerate, and preparing his shotgun for the killing blow. Meanwhile, Booker screamed in agony as every atom in his body became white-hot. In his blind agony, he reached out and called for an Undertow. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Back when Booker first bought Undertow, he remembered something Rosalind Lutece had told him about it. Somehow, the vigor sucked all the available water from the environment (In Columbia's case, the clouds) and using it all at once. In Columbia, sucking moisture out of the air created a tidal wave. In Rapture, the water he was summoning came from the ocean all around him. All of these thoughts suddenly occurred to him as he was swept away by thousands on gallons of sea water. 

Booker watched in alarm as the massive metal doors automatically closed, locking him in. Realizing that Jack might attack him, Booker quickly turned around, only to realize Jack was trying to use Sonic Boom to repel the water. Booker could feel his lungs crying out for air when he suddenly had an idea. Using the last of his air, he used Possession on the door; sending them both into another room. He stayed on the ground, gasping for air for a few seconds. He was too weak to move, but he could hear Jack quickly regaining consciousness. Booker panicked, feeling himself drift dangerously close to unconsciousness. 

Both men were half-dead from effort and severely waterlogged, but Jack's addiction to ADAM was enough to keep him going. He staggered to his feet and saw Booker struggling to remain conscious. Jack picked up his pistol, stood up, and eagerly aimed it at the Pinkerton's head. 

Booker saw this and strained himself to get up. Using every ounce of willpower, he weakly got on all fours. He could see Jack cocking his pistol. Booker had one trick left up his sleeve, but the timing had to be perfect; and he had only one chance. The exact second Jack pulled the trigger, Booker used the last of his effort to wield Return to Sender, sending the bullets directly into Jack's chest. And with that, his vision went black.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When he woke up an hour later, every muscle in Booker's body ached. Between almost drowning, the bruises from the wrench, and the effects of all of Jack's genetic modifications... Booker was in a lot of pain. Even Songbird hadn't come this close to killing him...

Still, there was one thing left to do. Booker staggered through the glass corridors of Rapture, which were as empty and cold as a dead man's veins. He eventually stumbled back into the room where it all started, listening for hushed sobbing. Eventually, he came across the little girl cowering in the corner. 

""Relax, honey, I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm here to help."" The Little Sister looked up at him with her sickly yellow eyes, and Booker tried not to react. ""Is the bad man gone?"" She asked fearfully. ""Uh... yeah, he's... gone."" Booker confirmed. ""Good,"" said the Little Sister, sweetly. ""Then he can't stop me from doing this!"" Before Booker could react, the girl jammed her 6-inch syringe into Booker's neck, draining the salts from his blood...

The Doctor, at some point during his hijinks, ends up in the DC universe. Upon arriving, SOMETHING happens involving the Justice League (I'm thinking Superman,Batman, flash, Wonderwoman, Aquaman, Martian Manhunter, and Green Lantern) that causes the doctor an immense amount of distress. In his rage, he decides to take the entire group out. 

The doctor has 6 months of prep time, and the entire DC Universe (past and present) to prepare. Let's assume that he doesn't realize/believe that they are ""good guys"" (even when consulting enemies/studying them), and perceives them as a great threat to the universe/multiverse. He has the Tardis, his screwdriver and psychic paper, along with any sort of weapon/object he can acquire during that timeframe. 

So basically, could The Doctor, given enough time and resources, cripple/kill every member of the Justice League (seperately or together). And for a fun second scenario, lets assume that if he defeated the Justice League, that he decides it's his duty to protect the DC universe from it's greatest threats, and he's tasked with defeating some of the Justice League's greatest enemies.

1374349734.0	1iplku	Assemble a team of fictional snipers to beat a team of real ones	AdjectiveRecoil	49	12	52	"I have assembled a team of real-life snipers, all notable for one reason or another. My challenge to you is: assemble a team consisting of fictional snipers to fight this team. You can have as many or as few team members as you want, and they can be anybody, even original characters. However, I do encourage you to pick your team members as to create an **interesting** and **even** fight. If you wish, your team can fight only part of (or just one member of) my team. There is no outside interference (the snipers cannot call in an artillery strike, for example). One team wins when the other team is completely dead or incapacitated. The time limit is 28 days; assume all parties have enough food/water/ammunition/etc. to last throughout the whole fight. If the fight is not done by then, it is a draw. The combatants cannot use vehicles. Your team's equipment is up to you; if you want, you may limit them to the equipment defined by the round parameters, or not.

Here is my team:

* [Carlos Hathcock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Hathcock)

* [Vasily Zaytsev](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasily_Zaytsev)

All team members can speak and understand each other's languages fluently, so there is no language barrier. They are all in their prime. They can choose whatever equipment they want, the only limitations being those set in the particular round. They have as much time as they need to familiarise themselves with their equipment and each other, and to train to work as a team. They will tend to deploy in sniper/spotter pairs.

**Round 1**

*Location:* The plains of Afghanistan. Flat and dusty, with the occasional mud brick village, or more modern structures such as radio towers.

*Equipment:* All equipment available to a modern sniper of any military, including spotting scopes and radios.

**Round 2**

*Location:* The mountains of the Caucasus. The terrain is hilly, with a mix of forests and open fields.

*Equipment:* Modern equipment, but no radios.

**Round 3**

*Location:* The ruins of Stalingrad (1945).

*Equipment:* Equipment that would be available to a WWII sniper of any military (not including radios).

**Super-Special Bonus Round**

*Location:* The area around Whistler-Blackcomb (Whistler, British Columbia, Canada) in the dead of winter. Wildlife is present.

*Equipment:* Modern equipment (including winter gear), short-range (~500 metres) radios, climbing gear, and WWI-WWII rifles. No scopes are allowed.

Edit: How do you think the fight would go? Who dies first? Who lasts the longest? Who gets the most kills/no kills, on either team? How do the environment and conditions of the round affect the combatants?

Edit 2: This is not just a test of accuracy, but also fieldcraft. A soldier with the best marksmanship in the world and poor fieldcraft is a terrible sniper. A soldier with average marksmanship and excellent fieldcraft can be a nightmare foe, a terrifying spectre that reaches out, touches men, and takes their lives with total impunity.

Edit 3: Please make your team killable with conventional weaponry. As a general note, please do not include game-breaking team members, or if you do, disallow their specific game-breaking abilities. I leave it to you to judge what is ""game-breaking""."	t5_2s599	True

He hears a strange whooshing noise and looks behind him to see a blue box appeared directly behind him.  A strange man in a fez steps out and tells him he is Pope-King of the Church of the Holy MacGuffin.

The Pope-King hurriedly explains the situation to Batman.  

""Basically, there's this fellow, Superman.  He's been zooming around for millions of years absorbing all sorts of power and such.  He's on his way here to punch you in the face.  It's not that he's evil, it's just this MacGuffin thing.  He'll be here in, oh, about one minute.""

Batman is understandably alarmed.  The Pope-King continues:

""Right, so the gist of it is you need to get in the box.  While in the box you will have access to basically all information ever recorded by the human race.  Time will not pass outside the box and you will not age inside the box.  While he can, this Superman will refrain from simply blinking you out of existence.  His win condition is punching you in the face.  Guy like that, though, it'll probably kill you.  Sorry.  Anyways, all you need to do is not get punched in the face for ten minutes after leaving the box.  You can have all the stuff in your Batcave, but no popping out to grab anything extra.""

So can he do it?  With all the prep time in the world can Batman avoid Superman Prime?  How would it play out?

1375411460.0	1jjg8b	"Usage of the term ""gods"";Warning: rant"	SleepyPanda1	47	10	13	"I please beg the posters/ commenters of this sub to stop using the term ""gods"" to assess/ compare power levels/ achievements of characters. I think it is easy to see that the ""gods"" of different universes/settings function vastly differently from those of others.

One sore thumb that sticks out as of late is people commenting on the GEoM's ability to hold back ""gods"" from another dimension. In my humble opinion, saying that somebody can fight against gods is incredibly vague, if not says very little of said somebody. Saying whatshisface has defeated ""all the gods"" or ""all the angels"" or whosimajig is ""essentially a demigod"" or ""god-like"" sounds so silly to me, simply because ""demigod"" and ""god"" can mean completely different things for different settings.

Another thing I have found is that the terms ""demi-god"", ""god"", ""angel"", ""cosmic being"" etc.. are used interchangeably by some people. An example would be is if somebody described Melkor as a fallen angel, while another describes him as a god of evil. While it serves as a simple way of description, I don't think we should rely on these lines when assessing power level. I think it these lines also go to show the ambiguity of the ""god"" terms.

Although gods don't often appear on this sub, this is just a little thing I want to get out there that has been bothering me a little.

So instead of using ""god"" term-statuses, just use concrete deeds/ accomplishments of said ""deities."" Using my previous example from above, Melkor/Morgoth has been influencing the happenings on Arda since the beginning of time. If I just say he is the total embodiment of evil (which I admittedly have), that's cool and all for just a brief, sensational description. But that's also leaving out the fact that he is capable of being physically wounded, which sort of mutes the entire ""cosmic-god-deity of super-evil and death.""

1375800426.0	1jtaq8	Batman vs. The Fantastic Four	cantcallmeamook	44	13	45	"**First scenario**: Batman has to break into the headquarters of the FF to retrieve some secret data stored locally on Reed Richards's computer. The FF can't allow the data to get into Batman's hands, as he intends to use it to build a weapon that will save many people currently facing imminent death at the cost of potentially starting a never-ending arms race that might annihilate civilization. The FF suspect he's coming but not when.

**Edit**: Both parties are well familiar with their adversary. Let's say they've already encountered each other once in a confrontation that ended in stalemate. 

**Edit 2/3**:  Ok, I'm back, had to run some errands --- great response so far!  Bellegante raised an important point: why can't Reed just destroy the data, or, alternatively, encrypt it and store it in some portable device and shoot that device off somewhere random and secret that only he knows?  Here's what I think I should say.  First, I realized the possibility that Reed might destroy the data was a loose end but thought I would leave it unspecified. But now I see it's certainly best to stipulate that Reed won't destroy the data willingly. So we'll suppose he needs it to develop a cure for Alzheimer's that he's been working on in secret due to the data's militarily sensitive nature. If it got into the open, and just anyone got hold of it, there would be grave likelihood for a terrible ensuing weapons race. For that reason, he can't risk sending it out in any compromisable form, and there would be no point in putting it somewhere where it could never be found, as he eventually needs to retrieve it for his research. Originally, in response to Bellegante's second point, I thought I should stipulate that because hiding the data in another physical location might take time, Batman will have some time to get in and steal it.  Now I think the right response is to just allow the possibility that Reed might destroy his original copy and hide another copy somewhere secret, and that he might do all this very quickly.  I'd only draw attention to Batman's ability to track Reed's attempt to hide it.  Reed could use the internet, but that might compromise the data's security, as well as make its location traceable.  Alternatively, he might attach it to a rocket or something similar, and send it off to a hidden location.  In either case Batman might have considered these possibilities and use some tracking devices of his own to monitor outgoing objects from the FF headquarters.  Is this feasible?  Well it's up for debate: it's Richards's tech and wits vs. Wayne's tech and wits. 

Finally, also, we should note that AF79 has already suggested an interesting strategy that Batman might employ which would nullify Reed's efforts to hide the data: Batman might come up with a way to _compel_ Reed to _give_ him the data. 
 
**Second scenario**: Both sides are trying to find and incapacitate the other in an empty skyscraper at night.  They have both had time for minimal planning prior to the confrontation.

He has access to his own bootleg faerie tech, but no actual faeries - his only ally is Butler. Ender and his Dragon Army are dropped into the streets of the city with a month to acquire whatever equipment they can find or steal and hide their flag. To win, either party must return their opponent's flag to their ""base"" - in Artemis' case, his villa, and in Ender's case, a building in the city he decides on during the preparations, which will be initially unknown to Artemis.

Round 4: Assassination - Same setup conditions as round 3, but the win condition is now ""kill the enemy commander."""	t5_2s599	True

1370902009.0	1g2qan	The Case of Two Sherlocks	dahahawgy	40	7	12	"Note: Unmarked spoilers for both *Sherlock* and *Elementary* below, and probably in the comments as well (though if someone could tell me how to spoiler tag in this sub, that'd be amazing).

Another note: I do realize *Sherlock*'s immense popularity, both on this site and elsewhere. I'm a fan of both, and I'm sure there are more here who are, so I'd hope to avoid the reactionary vitriol espoused by a lot of fans of each show out there on the wider internet. I guess just remember to keep it objective, is what I'm saying.

The setup: Benedict Cumberbatch's Holmes and Jonny Lee Miller's Holmes each happen upon a crime scene in their respective home bases. Interest immediately piqued.

B-Holmes's case involves a victim wearing a cheap red hoodie with the price tag still on. White male, shot through the chest, guilty gun in right hand. However, observing the callouses on each of his hands and the granite on his left pinkie, B-Holmes deduces the victim, identified as a store clerk named Jebb, is left-handed, presumably unbeknownst to the killer, indicating a lack of closer relationship, unless it was a clue meant for Sherlock to find, implying exactly such a relationship.

Meanwhile, J-Holmes looks over the body of a young woman named Gladwyn, a local student. She is dressed elegantly from head to toe, strange enough already for an indebted college girl out for a stroll, but there appears to be no sign of robbery. Several stab wounds to the abdomen, but not too much blood. J-Holmes points out the girl's lips, shaded with lipstick but ultimately somewhat ill-fitting with her skin color, given her otherwise impeccable fashion sense. Diagnosis? Discoloration via poison.

Each Sherlock is aided by his respective Watson. The game, then: to determine who will be the first to find the motive, find the killer, and, in the end, link the crime to the true mastermind behind them both...the *literary* legend, Professor James Moriarty, whose goals are far bigger than the sum of these grisly murders.

Feel free to interpret the evidence how you like, invent backstories for the victims, throw in whatever twists you want, etc. In the end, though, who is the superior match for the Napoleon of Crime?

The players:

B-Holmes has become something of a celebrity, known for his incredible one-over scans that tell him all he needs to know about a given target. His compulsion to solve crimes stems from immense boredom, bordering on manic when not mentally stimulated. Possesses eidetic memory, to the point of recreating seemingly errant finger taps days later. Has been demonstrated to overlook certain things when in a state of great panic. Arguably the bigger asshole by far, immediately alienating most who come into contact with him. Of the two Sherlocks, he was shown to be far (*far*) quicker in deducing what he could about his version of Moriarty. His companion, John Watson, is a former army doctor who helps to counterbalance Sherlock's stubbornness and lack of social skills. Underrated by the in-universe media, he helps humanize and focus Sherlock in a way few others can.

J-Holmes regularly works with the local police department to put both one-time and spree killers behind bars on a weekly basis, and despite his somewhat off-putting personality, is a trusted resource. Shown to be most adept at uncovering dirt others wish to keep hidden, such as phony credentials and illicit affairs. Consults the police out of an interest in the criminal element, but has many hobbies besides. Able to take in and process stimuli from a great number of sources simultaneously, as shown when he is able to repeat perfectly a soap opera's dialogue while taking in information from several other television sets at once. Recovering heroin addict, sober for over a year, though his past occasionally comes back to haunt him. Joan Watson is his former sober companion, and before that, a hospital surgeon. Well on her way to becoming a capable detective in her own right, she was instrumental in capturing their version of Moriarty.

* 100 m race: Teenagers and early 20s takes this. It's the best combination of weight and athleticism. Once again, the pros will be older but they are a minority.

Don't just say ""The Hulk"" give us an idea of how angry he is, what incarnation, and stuff like that.

First I'd like to say that I love this sub, there are some knowledgable people on here posting fun scenarios and getting interesting answers.    But I'm trying to assess a problem with the answers posed here.

This community was built as a forum for Discussion, yet when a post is submitted it seems that everyone jumps at which ever character they think would win and says ""X would win, no contest.""   Basically eliminating further discussion.

Open ended questions occasionally are subject to this the worst, it seems every time one is posted everyone jumps to whatever extreme pops into their head first, stating X would cream Y because X is basically God.   Because of this most open ended questions get buried, which is, in my opinion, a mistake.    When a person poses an open ended question with a fighter of their choice vs whoever you can come up with they aren't looking for someone that would make their character an Ant compared to your Boot.   They are looking for a ""worthy"" opponent.   Open ended scenarios give us a chance to engage multiple fights within a single comment section, opening up the  possibility of further posts to continue the discussion.    While these ludicrous answers can be amusing in some scenarios it halts further discussion and eliminates what we came here to experience; Interest.

**Interest is what really pushes this sub forward.**

I'm not saying some fights won't be one sided, but instead of answering with X wins easily, period; say why, working both sides of the argument until a victor is clear.

**TL;DR:**To quote an idea from Stephen Fry ""It's better to be interesting, than right.""

Flash - It really just doesn't make sense for Flash to lose. He can vibrate so fast that things pass through him, and once you phase through him you explode, he can also run faster than the speed of light. so basically he can just explode you faster than your brain can tell your muscles to dodge.

Superman - He's almost as fast as Flash, nearly indestructible, strong enough to throw planets. This one is pretty straight forward.

Batman - the way Batman is written is kind of shitty. Don't get me wrong, I love to read Batman (favorite super hero) but his writers just don't give a fuck. People have just explicitly stated that he's a complete master of all marital arts, a super genius, master escape artist, etc. He's the best you can be without powers, so unless you have powers, there really isn't a way to beat Batman.

My proposition...

Use the DC Animated Universe. I've been watching Justice League (Unlimited) on netflix. Something I noticed? The DC Animated Universe uses significantly weaker characters. Flash generally never uses his max speed (only once, but he slipped into the speed force and had to be pulled out). Superman has trouble lifting much less than he lifts in comics, and he can totally be punched and kicked around, he's still ""invulnerable"" but he can feel pain and take damage, I just don't think he could be cut/punctured/ripped. Batman is still pretty ""Batman-y"" but not to the same extent. Still smart, still an escape artist, but doesn't seem quite sneaky and resourceful. Resorts to fighting quite a bit.


Anyway, I would encourage you guys to use the DCAU versions of the really intense characters to keep things interesting. "	t5_2s599	True
1365552145.0	1c0zk7	What is a fictional universe or story that you would like to see more of in this sub?	Roflmoo	33	5	125	"##Let's face it. 

We're all getting really sick of Hulk, Superman, Flash, Goku, and Batman being in every third post, every day, for... at least the last three months. 

    It's also becoming a problem that people are leaving out a character's personality, and are only 
    focusing on the powers. 
    (Yes, Flash is fast. No, he doesn't use the infinite mass punch every single fight.) 

There are plenty of others out there, and they deserve some more attention. 

So, instead of saying these characters *can't* be posted, let's just make a conscious effort as a community to find and use others. We can still involve the overused characters, but come on. It's boring to use them in every battle here. 

Anyway, list some other works that have good characters. Cartoons, video games, movies, comics, anime, books, you name it. Go nuts. And remember, **look at what others post**. There's not going to be any progress if we don't actually listen to each other.

Here's my starter list. There are plenty of characters in each that would be great for this sub.

Pokemon

Disney

Loony Tunes

Hannah-Barbera

World of Warcraft

Dungeons and Dragons

Magic: The Gathering

Yu-Gi-Oh!

Yu Yu Hakusho

Pirates of the Caribbean

Harry Potter (There's more people there than Harry and Dumbledore, guys.)

Star Wars (Again, there's more than Vader, and people need to stop pretending he's Starkiller.)

Star Trek

There's your starter list. Please add more and please please PLEASE try harder to use different people!

We can assume that the average human has 100 health points and weapons behave accordingly. Mercenaries have access to all of their weapon unlocks (and hats), as well as upgrade stations.

Scenario 1: Mercenaries respawn after 15-20 seconds and lose if the army successfully delivers a bomb to the end of the map. 

Scenario 2: Mercenaries die permanently and the army has no other goal then to kill them.

Edit: Some points for clarification

It is the full team of 9 mercs, not just 6 like in mvm. Prep is given as this: a few minutes before the fight starts, the Announcer tells the team that instead of robots, the US Army has arrived to arrest Saxton Hale on counts of [list Hale's numerous crimes here], and that they must defend him at all costs. The army knows there will be heavy resistance, but they do not know the details of who the mercenaries are or any of their weapons/abilities.

The contests: 

Round 1) Tom is sitting at home in the Barrow Downs singing his songs and smoking his weed. The Chaos Gods decide to end their eternal war and go to corrupt Tom. They can only speak to him and his wife with no direct contact. Can they cause Tom to fall or will he drive them insane with his songs and bright boots?

Round 3) Eru Ilúvatar realizes the threat that the Chaos gods pose to his creation bloodlusts Tom and places his home on the Warp. Tom (With all of his powers) goes forth to destroy the forces of Chaos. He is alone in this endeavor but at full power. Does Tom succeed in ending this threat to the universe once and for all?

1372701241.0	1hfthg	Possible Battle Template	Wallzo	37	7	25	"This is all from my other post, How to Make a Battle Post, with a little bit of editing.

Here are the Standard Battle Rules:

How to win:**If OP doesn't state anything, then it is assumed KO, BFR, Incap or Death are all acceptable ways to win.**

Prep:**If the OP doesn't say anything about prep, assume that there is no prep.**

Knowledge: **If OP doesn't say anything about knowledge, assume there is no knowledge on the opponent.** There are three types of knowledge:

1) Common Knowledge: Whatever a person on the street in the characters universe would know.

2) Basic Knowledge: information that can be obtained by reading the characters wiki page or maybe looking at a Respect thread.

3) Extensive Knowledge: Access to every appearance of said character.


Iteration:**If OP doesn't say anything about iteration, assume the character is in their current native form. DC characters do not apply to this rule and are assumed to be Post Crisis and not New 52. Peter Parker is also Spider-Man, not Doc Oc. If you want to use Doc Oc Spider-Man, say it.** Ex: ""Superman vs Spider-Man"" implies Post Crisis DC Universe Superman versus Marvel 616 Universe Spider-Man. 


Attitude: **If OP doesn't say anything about attitude, assume the character is in their normal mindset.** BATTLE HISTORY IS IMPORTANT. It shows how the character fights on a regular basis. No Morals just means that the character is serious about the fight. If a character like Batman has to kill their opponent to win because the OP said so, assume that they are in their normal mindset with an exception.

Equipment: **If OP doesn't say anything about equipment, assume the character has his regular equipment.**

Location: **Here is the idea from Roflmoo**:

&gt;I have a suggestion. It's something I was considering for the Tournament, but I think we're going in a different direction, so it could be perfect here.

&gt;The basic idea is that each fighter would get to choose one thing about the environment that suited them, and the Arena would accommodate them. For example, if Spider-man fights, he would choose an arena with large buildings, trees, or other areas that allow him to use his web-swinging to it's fullest. If Aquaman fights, he'd choose an arena with a large amount of water, possibly sea life.

&gt;So if they fought, it might be an arena like the flooded Thousand Needles map from WoW.
&gt;If the choices of the fighters are the only guidelines, it becomes even more interesting. The arena could be anything the user chooses. It could be an oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico, or a half-flooded city... which very well might be bordering the Gulf of Mexico...

&gt;The point is, both fighters get what they want, and it makes for some very interesting fights.

* Who is the first to strike?  Does he succeed?  If not, who is the first to win?
* Who is sent to kill him?  Does he slay the mountain?  (nah)
* If possible, a year by year description would be nice.

Limitations

* He is like Ed, in that he does not have an established spy network, but he is aware that those networks exist.
* Bruce can use his ingenuity, but he cannot invent things that are highly unreasonable due to the technology.  For instance, he could make functional batarangs, traps, saddle, and smokescreens.  He cannot create electricity, cars, rappel guns, supercomputers in a reasonable amount of time.  He also cannot discover lost secrets, like valyrian steel, or magic from essos.  He can learn how to make wildfire, but that means giving up his lordship and would likely mean he 'loses' based on victory conditions.
* Bruce is a lord of the house Wayne.  It's symbol is a red bat on a black background.  He can have a single pet bat, is a warg with it, and is trained with using it.  He has a full suit of full plate armor, a longsword of valyrian steel, and a set of black leather armor which he uses for nighttime spying.  You can decide where the House Wayne comes from.  He is on decent terms with the houses on those kingdoms.  I'm a fan of the riverlands.  
* He has 10 knights under his command.  They are typical soldiers, with one month's worth of side training from bruce before they got to kings landing.  They are slightly more perceptive, know a few more types of fighting, and can sneak around.
* This is new 52 batman, none of that batgod.  He will always stick to his morals.  And his strange sleep cycle.

1368503629.0	1eald3	Earths vs. Earth	AdjectiveRecoil	32	4	32	"Repost from earlier because I got the title wrong.

Modern Earth (m!Earth) vs. past Earths (p!Earths).

The p!Earths are past versions of Earth. They are:

* Earth, 10,000 BCE
* Earth, 4,000 BCE
* Earth, 3,000 BCE
* Earth, 2,000 BCE
* Earth, 1,000 BCE
* Earth, 0 CE
* Earth, 117 CE
* Earth, 1066 CE
* Earth, 808 CE
* Earth, 1206 CE
* Earth, 1453 CE
* Earth, 1590 CE
* Earth, 1630 CE
* Earth, 1776 CE
* Earth, 1864 CE
* Earth, 1914 CE

Earth 1914 leads the other p!Earths and provides technology. Movement between p!Earths is accomplished using two-dimensional gateways that range from less than two meters wide to over three kilometers wide and fifteen tall. The way these gateways work: a gate is comprised of a 2-dimensional geometric shape; the number of sides ranges from 3 (triangular) to infinity (circular). Gates with 3-12 sides are the most common. If Ælfric passes through gate A (which is aligned north-south along its width so that one flat side faces west, another east) from the west in 1066, he will emerge from its east side in another time. If Harold crosses from the east in 1066, he will emerge in the west in another time; thus, Harold and Ælfric can walk toward each other, and emerge facing away from each other. This means that two armies can enter the same gate from different sides, effectively doubling a gate's transport capacity. Gates permit two-way travel. They can only transport through time, not space; so a gate located at Stonehenge will take people to Stonehenge X number of years ago/from now, and not London or Istanbul or Beijing. Due to the appearance of the gates, their presence may not be initially obvious; if it was a sunny day on both sides of a gate, it might go unnoticed. However, if on one side, it was snowing, while on the other, it was sunny, there would be a large geometrically shaped hole in the air through which one could see the snowy landscape.

The p!Earths get 35 years of prep time. m!Earth gets no prep time. On 28 June 2013, gates open at these locations:

**Americas**

* 12 nautical miles south of Hawa'i

[For example, the goliath from starcraft.](http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/45407/1478710-goliath_sc2_rend1.jpg). Any creature or machine that weighs over 500 kilograms on it's own counts as a vehicle. If it is intelligent enough to fight effectively without guidance, it also counts as a squad member.

- A retreat is a loss. Leaving the atmosphere counts as retreat.

- [Roflmoo scale](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1e87ba/tournament_stats_list_and_chart_template/) is used. Quantify the power of every uniquely equiped member of your squad and the two vehicles using this system. Do not make them so strong they reach or surpass rank 7 any part of this rating system, and do not make them reach or surpass rank 6 in the danger scale, and please stay balanced. 

- Fights are 3 rounds, one on a flat indestructible surface, one in a hilly area with a lot of large boulders and plant life, and one in an evactuated urban enviroment. In each case, atmosphere is breathable.

- **FULL** I will use [this](http://challonge.com/tournament/bracket_generator) tournament generator to generate the brackets.

- Fights are decided through debate and then a vote. Every participant votes, as do I.

- You cannot change your squad's equipment between fights or rounds. Up until your first battle, you can change the squad however many times you want and as extremely as you want.

**Tips:**

- There is no rule against jetpacks, aeroplanes or other flying things!

- Keep in mind you and your opponents can use biochemical and energy weapons, as well as traditional ones!

- The range you're fighting at might not always be what you want it to be: Keep this in mind!

- You can't shoot what you cannot see: Cover, stealth and detection might be important!

- Don't forget not everyone might use electronics, impact weaponry or humans: Balance your armor, weaponry and detection accordingly!

- Think outside the box: Have you never seen it before in science-fiction? *Perfect!*

Gordon is in prime condition from any point in Half Life 2. He's at full suit charge and health, as well as full ammo for all his weapons. He's wearing his HEV suit, which gives him a flashlight, the ability to sprint at twice the speed of a normal human, shielding from various environmental hazards such as acid, radiation, and extreme temperatures, as well as a robust life support system, which can cure toxins and stabilize him, allowing him to fight at the peak of his strength even if he's nearly dead.

1371950423.0	1gvwcb	Pick a Duo. Pit them against someone else's Duo.	Etrae	32	5	149	"Here's your chance to be creative! Pick 2 characters from any universe or any two different universes and post them as a comment or reply to an existing comment to pit your duo against someone else's.

**Rules:**

* The 2 characters picked can be from the same universe or 2 different universes. 

* They MUST compliment each other. Don't just pick Superman Prime and Sentry because they're the most powerful. Their powers or traits have to directly compliment the other character, one way or another. Creative use of power compliments encouraged! Buggs Bunny teamed up with Hulk to enrage him for example. Try not to use Hulk though - See next rule.

* It would be preferred if the big picks are ignored for the purposes of this post. I can't stop you obviously but this should be a break from all the recurring big names in this sub in order to showcase the potential infinite power of 2 lesser known characters feeding off each other's powers/skills.

* The fight is welcome to take place in the original comment's arena of choice. If none is specified, a default arena in an empty area with a set stage is assumed (think Cell's tournament from DBZ).

* The fight can destroy the entire planet or universe but shouldn't compromise any character's morality. Personality is just as important as powers in any fight. 

* It's assumed that both characters agree to fight together for whatever reason, regardless of their feelings toward each other. Feel free to describe how they came to that decision. Feel free to use their tension for or against them in the fight.

* The characters are welcome to any gear they would normally bring to a fight. If they're able to carry more in preparation for a big/difficult fight, they can bring that too. Nothing more than they can carry. AI or voice-in-head secondary characters like Jarvis or Cortana are allowed as they are part of what makes the character so good on their own. No vehicles or death machines or instant-win macguffins. Prep time is minimal - The fighters are plopped into the arena and provoked into fighting. Feel free to describe that as well.

**Bonus Round:** After each initial fight, retaliate with the same Duo but, in addition, you create a 3rd character with a power that compliments the duo even further. Your opponents then add their 3rd character. SIMPLE original characters encouraged! (To clarify : the 3rd character, if an original character, should have a fairly simple power/ability that compliments but doesn't overshadow the original duo. Think of them as the sidekick/support to your duo.)

1373946663.0	1ie1vc	Santa's Had Enough	vosqueej	31	3	8	"*Intro is optional, however it does give you some insight as to how this clusterfuck of a Who Would Win came to exist.*

So a couple days ago I was visiting my uncle's house, and he introduced me to the new woman he's dating as well as her two sons. The younger boy was particularly creative and asked me multiple ""would you rather""s that he would come up with on the spot. Long story short, I think this subreddit would appreciate the final question he ended up asking me. I've modified it into a WWW question so that you guys can answer.

Also bear in mind that I'll be quoting a lot of what he told me as directly as I can recall him saying it.

The Scenario At Its Simplest:

**Santa Claus vs. Mrs. Claus and roughly 13,000 Elves at the North Pole**

The Teams in Detail:

**Team 1: Santa Claus**

*Santa- the big, jolly, fat man of Christmas- has become heavily disappointed with his elves, going as far as saying ""they make crappy toys"" and similar things. He fired most of his elves because of this (hence why there's only about 13,000 now- at first we thought there was a billion elves but then we recounted) and so the remaining elves have decided to rebel. Santa will be going into combat with the intent to kill anyone who stands in his way, armed with the Force. No lightsaber, no reindeer, no sleigh, no potentially lethal toys. Just him, his jolliness, and the Force.*

**Team 2: The Mrs. and the Elves**

*Mrs. Claus has sided with the elves because she believes Santa was unjust in terminating the elves' work contract. She will be armed with a chainsaw. The elves all ""suck in fights"" however there is 13,000 of them and they will not hold back. They're slightly smaller than an average six-year-old child.*


Now this is clearly very one-sided as is, however some twists were added to keep us on our toes.

**Twist #1: You get to fight on the team of your choosing**

Yup, you get to choose who you support in this mass stupidity. Here's your backstory:

*You, a (wo)man, have been in a relationship with a same-sex-as-yourself gorilla for a few years now. You have adopted a gecko as your child. While your spouserilla is aggressive at times (going as far as whipping you against walls when they've had a bad day), you both can communicate to each other through sign language. Somehow you get pulled into this fight, and that's all we have to go on for now.*

**If you fight with Santa,** you get to call your spouserilla into battle with you and ride on them like a horse. You also gain the Force and flight powers but that's it.

On the other hand, **if you join Mrs. Claus and the elves,** you can't call your spouserilla into the battle, nor do you have any superpowers/the Force. However, you do gain access to an infinite supply of silkworms to throw at Santa (the silkworms are unaffected by the Force). Two seconds after contact, the silkworms explode into fireworks. Upon killing Santa, he explodes into stale cookies and ""damp milk"" as it was described to me. Ten of your inchworms want to eat those cookies, and you have to feed them yourself.

**Twist #2: Mrs. Claus is actually dead (sort of)**

Turns out if you join Mrs. Claus' team, the first thing she'll do (and you can't stop her) is try to throw her chainsaw at Santa. Santa will see this, and then return the chainsaw to Mrs. Claus' face, instantly killing her. At this time you gain access to her chainsaw to attack Santa with. However, *you must use it to melee Santa*, as he will decapitate you with it if you throw it. He can't control it if you're holding it. Keep in mind, **you must join Mrs. Claus' team for this to happen. If you join Santa, Mrs. Claus will not be instakilled and you can't take her chainsaw.**

**Twist #3: I don't even have a title for this one**

Your spouserilla is having an affair with your adopted gecko-child.

Yeah.

The almighty Dovakiin finds himself in Westoros just as the War of Five Kings begins to heat up. Knowing full well that the Others are preparing to invade south of the Wall, the Dragonborn once again finds himself in the position of having to reunite a broken kingdom in order to resist a supernatural invasion. This time however, he intends take control of the throne for himself and lead the Westorosi to victory against the undead winter army. Question is: How does he do it? Does he form alliances with one of the noble houses in exchange for the promise of wealth and political influence, or does he just *Fus-Ro-Dah* his way to the Red Keep and throw Joffrey off the Iron Throne before shouting ""Mine now!""

Here are the rules [Spoilers]:

-The war can only be won when ALL seven kingdoms swear fealty to the Dragonborn (no independence for the North or the Iron Isles). Note that the stage of the war is near the middle of *Storm of Swords*, after Danaerys has taken the Unsullied but before the Red Wedding.

-~~Due to the fact that magic is limited for everyone in Westoros, the same limitations must be placed on the Dovakiin. Magicka takes several hours to recharge and Thu'ums can only be used once a day.~~

-~~Dragonrend is, for whatever reason, ineffective against Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion. Don't want to make it too easy for him when Danaerys eventually shows up.~~

Edit: After reading the comments, I've decided to remove the restrictions on Dovakiin, he/she is now full power with all abilities learned by the end of the game. That includes Call Dragon, an ability I overlooked at the time, which would prove interesting in a Dovakiin vs Danaerys confrontation."	t5_2s599	True

Top pics would involve Soundwave, James Bond, the Baroness, Alias, Black Widow, Jason Bourne, Fantomex, Mara Jade, Johnny English. Fights between these guys are never straight-up brawls. Opinions?

Edit-this is not about assassination. It's about laying low, infiltrating enemy power structures, getting hold of sensitive and protected information, and getting said info back to HQ *unnoticed*. Take the brawl mentality to your DBZ wankfests. Any violent confrontation breaks cover.

edit 2-sorry..Sterling Archer is a murder savant, but a terrible spy. dead last.

Top human spies seem to be Michael Westen, Sam Fisher, and George Smiley. Top meta spies would have to be Mystique and Zartan. Massive tech advantages of course put the Agent (Contact)and Soundwave (IDW Decepticon) to the top, but Soundwave carries his own fricking army of 19 specialist bots on him, and should be disqualified for cheating.

The low-tech approach is covered admirably by Varys, Master of Whispers for the Iron Throne, an obese old eunuch who manages to have an entire kingdom tied up in blackmail, intrigue, secret favors, and whatnot. He truly lives the spy game and has no life outside it, or without it. "	t5_2s599	True

1. The post I most want to discuss is [Wallzo's Possible Battle Template Post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1hfthg/possible_battle_template/) He's done a great job of outlining a default for battle posts, and he's been very patient with me as it's taken me a long time to give it the attention it deserves. Please go there and make your voices heard. A link may be added to the sidebar for this topic if enough interest is shown. Either way, at least read the post, because there's a lot of great information and guidelines to keep in mind.

2. Read the sidebar, guys. Go ahead, I'll wait here. You know, the very first thing listed under the part that says ""IMPORTANT""? It's not that massive a deal, but come on. When a post or a comment is on-topic, what is the point of downvoting? We're all discussing the same things, and we all have the same interests. Even when we don't agree, we'd all be friends in real life. So chill. If no one disagreed with us, we would have no subreddit for these discussions. It's one thing to disagree, it's another to disagree and do nothing about it but downvote. I know I'd like this to be a place where the point is NOT to be popular, but to find the best answer and have fun doing it. This subreddit means nothing if every unpopular position gets buried. 

3. Lastly, I need to make an apology for the impressive backlog I've developed while I was away the last several days. If you've sent a message or a post, and I haven't replied, please understand that I am not ignoring you, and I'm hoping to get through it all in the coming days. However, this does bring us into Tournament News.


##Tournament News


1. I really haven't gotten a lot done lately, and doubtlessly, several of you have noticed I've been MIA the last week or so. The Tournament is still on, so don't panic, but I have to say now that we may not make the December start date I originally hoped for. We'll see. I have always known that real life comes first, and since the Tournament Staff and I are all volunteers, we haven't all been free to coordinate or work on as much as some may have hoped. I won't say things *can't* be ready by the end of the year, but I believe it's irresponsible to maintain that release date at this time. For now, I will leave that date open to change, at least until I have more information about how long it will take to do what we need to do.

2. A large number of charts have just recently been added to the main [Tournament Fighters List](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1e870b/upgraded_tournament_fighters_list_work_in_progress/) by users, but have not been checked for accuracy. Many of these charts were suggestions made on the [Tournament Registration post](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1fyblg/tournament_character_registration/). Please take some time to look at the charts and verify the information for any fighters you know well, especially those that have been ~~crossed off~~ the Registration list. 
 * This is also a good chance to offer pictures for any Fighter's Image link. The best pictures will be included in the main charts. The Image link is supposed to show the proper version of the character and it's best if they look as awesome as possible. I try to find good ones and volunteers have found some great ones as well, but if you have one you think is better, link it under the relevant chart.
 * If you want to try out for the Writing Staff, you can request permission to write for any two characters on the main list. (You need to ask because several fights are already being written, and we don't want repeats.) The more writing staff, the faster the Tournament will go, but I need to be careful who I let in, because it's that much more difficult to organize everyone when there's a larger number. To be honest, I need to maintain a standard of talent and writing ability, as well as availability and dedication among the Tournament Staff. Please consider offering your talents as a Guest Writer instead of trying to become a Staff Member if you will not be able to stick with us for the long-term. For more information on either position, please don't hesitate to send me a message.
 * **Also, if you are thinking about charting any more fighters, please read this first!** As I said above, I have a backlog to take care of. In there are several charts made by several of the top contributors and they do not currently show up on the main chart. They will soon, but I'd hate for anyone to waste their time charting someone who's already been completed. **Ask me** if a fighter is complete before starting your own charts. Once they're made, post them one by one in the Tournament Fighters List post, with the others.

3. The Tournament Staff has two rough drafts done and ready to be worked on, but I haven't been available to work with them on the rest of the writing. The writing will continue, but it has to come after real life, which is taking up a little more time, lately. As for writing... more on that next.

1. I want to know what you, the users, want to happen next. Obviously, the Tournament is my largest project, but it's not the only one, and frankly, I have plenty of other ideas that I'd like to spend more time on. The Doomie Awards, more written non-tournament battles like the Terminator vs Xenomorph battle, and the Fictional Metals Reference chart have all suffered because I was devoting too much time to the Tournament alone. I'd like to balance my time a little better, and since I pride myself in generating content for this sub, I'd like to know what else you guys want to see. I will be sinking less of my time into the Tournament and using more time to actually enjoy this sub again. If you can think of any small projects that would be fun, that you'd also like me involved with, by all means, let me know about them. 

Of course, I want to emphasize that I'm not the only one who can start projects and events like these. You guys generate the bulk of the content here, and you're entitled to create anything you want within the sub's theme. If you have any ideas or questions and you'd like my input, let me know, and I'll see what I can do. 

Anyway, I think that's all for now. It's good to be back, and I'll see you guys around. Thanks again for everyone's patience while I was away. "	t5_2s599	True

He has a device that can teleport him from the Batcave to a secure location near Marvel's NYC and back again, (cannot be used in combat, only works for him) but he is otherwise limited to resources from the Batcave and the Marvel universe. If he uses Marvel tech, there needs to be an explanation for how he learned of it and obtained it. 

His task is to steal a small device from Richards, but Richards keeps it hidden in a safe somewhere in the Baxter Building. Assume that the device is so secret, the Fantastic Four cannot risk S.H.I.E.L.D., the Avengers, or anyone else knowing of it. (Zero chance for backup.)

The Fantastic Four are aware of a plan to steal something, but they do not know what, and all they know of Batman is that he is a human, a thief, from another realm with powered individuals, and is very skilled.

Batman must infiltrate the Baxter Building, incapacitate each of the Four, (but does not necessarily need to face them directly) and leave with the device. Assume Batman will have time to locate the device if he can eliminate the threat.

They boast about how they're probably the deadliest thing in the known galaxy! Surely, between their cloaking abilities, ability to track b body heat, plasma guns and wicked-cool knives they must have the highest body count of anything!

Until one of them remembers a documentary from a few months back, about a new planet called 'Earth', and a disease there that killed 1.8 million people in a single year.

They get drunk and angry, how dare something be more dangerous than them! A parasite, no less!

They decide it simply will not do! They pull some strings, book vacation time and carpool to earth with one goal in mind!

Killing more people in a year than Malaria does.

They have access to any personal technology, hand to hand weapons, ranged weapons and other goodies they need and resupply is not an issue.

To elaborate on the examples in the title :-

**Spider-Man**: Nerd guy gets super powers and starts getting attention from girls. I mean really... what nerd doesn't wish they were bitten by a radioactive spider and as an added bonus of not getting cancer you get super powers. Your life changes and makes it so much more exciting but you still retain your nerd intellect.

**Batman**: Pretty obvious. You have more money than you can shake a stick at and you have stunning good looks to boot. You have the most elite and secret clubhouse under your mansion and have a butler to serve you and give you sage advice from time to time. Criminals and bad guys are inherently afraid of you because you are the Goddamned Batman!

**Superman**: A living god with no real weaknesses. You are fast, strong, near invulnerable, can see through walls, see far, hear better, shoot lasers from your eyes and blow cold air (Seriously how does that work?). Only weakness is that it sorta feel too boring now kinda like how it makes it hard to make a good Superman game without filling it with kryptonite everywhere and red sun lamps.

**Hulk**: Your rage incarnated. Ever feel angry? Of course you do. When you do don;t you sometimes feel as unstoppable as proportionate to your anger? What if you actually were? This fantasy is a constant for him and mostly an overused plot twist in JP anime. Bad guy does something and the hero is down and then he gets angry and gains more power enough to beat the bad guy in the most dramatic way with lots of screaming.

**Flash**: Everything is at a standstill for you. You move so fast you can get away and do anything you can think of. Nothing is out of your reach and you are untouchable.

**Punisher**: Extra! Ever read news about how poorly criminals treat others or watch a movie where the mob bullies that poor couple who just want to run their laundromat? What if you could [punish them with no consequences? What if you can show those assholes what if feels like to have someone judge their fate?

You can name your own such as **Shazam** where you are a little kid who gains superpowers, **Optimus Prime** I mean really... when you were 7 years old don't try to tell me you never wised you were some kinda robot. What if you were a robot who turns into a bad ass truck?"	t5_2s599	True

So would the universes destroy their new enemies or would they be destroyed?

Rules. 

1. None of the other races alive in either universe are at war with each other but any tensions that were there before would still exist.
2. The reapers are now gone from mass effect and flood are gone from the halo universe.
3. The Protheans are at the height of their power before the reapers destroyed them.
4. The forerunners are at the height of their military strength and influence before they completely purged their military. The prometheans do not exist.

This is the post where you can request new fighters for the [Tournament Fighters List](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1e870b/upgraded_tournament_fighters_list_work_in_progress/) and is totally not a way to cover the fact that I accidentally lost the folder with all your requests in it.

Please check the list to be sure your fighter isn't already on there. (Remember, it's growing all the time, check often.)

Please help me by not overloading me on too many from one universe. I know there are a lot of great characters out there, but let's get the main ones from all of them before we worry about getting *all* of the people from any of them. 

Points for trying to fill in empty rows.

2. [Boethiah](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Boethiah)
3. [Hermaeus Mora](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki\Hermaeos_Mora). Not completely all knowing I don't think, but definitely at least a 7 on the Intelligence stat.
4. [Hircine](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Hircine)
5. [Sheogorath](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Sheogorath)
6. [Malacath](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Malacath), who I would expect to be like Christ, except more cursey curse than healy heal. (Fig trees you say? That's cute.)
7. [Mehrunes Dagon](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Mehrunes_Dagon). Huge player here I think.
8. [Meridia](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Meridia) perhaps? Would be useful against any reanimators.
9. [Molag Bal](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Molag_Bal)

[Static Shock](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Virgil_Hawkins_%28Dakotaverse%29) Can interfere with radio waves, control metal like a mini magneto, drain electronics of their power, and shoot lightning.

[Batman (Beyond)](http://batman.wikia.com/wiki/Batman_%28Terry_McGinnis%29) Next generation Batman. All the powers of the first batman except the intelligence, but a much more hightech car, rocket boots, suit that gifts super strength. 

[Generator Rex](http://generatorrex.wikia.com/wiki/Rex_Salazar) Nanite infused engineer who can create weapons on up to 2 separate body parts at a time, and control tech by touch.

[Edward Elric AKA The Full-Metal Alchemist](http://fma.wikia.com/wiki/Edward_Elric) Super alchemist with the ability to rearrange molecules of any substance at touch, and a robotic arm and leg.

[Cyborg](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Victor_Stone_%28Earth-Teen_Titans%29) Supersmart heavily armed and armored half robot man that shoots missiles, and sonic blasts, and is rigged with super strength and lots of tools and gadgets. 

[Himura Kenshin (Rurouni Kenshin)](http://kenshin.wikia.com/wiki/Himura_Kenshin) Ordinary human samurai other than being about twice as fast as a usual human, and being able to jump probably 15 feet off the ground. Refuses to ever kill (again) and is a great detective from the feudal era of Japan.

* Pick a weapon from the list.

* State how you would use it to survive the arena.

* Another commenter picks a different weapon and states BOTH how to survive the arena and how to defeat you.

* Reply back how it may not work so well as s/he planned.


*The area is a post apocalyptic setting much like in ""The Last of us"" where the buildings are in ruins and covered in vegetation. You two are the only LIVE inhabitants of the arena as the rest are populated with RE1 style zombies. You can find other makeshift weapons and transport to augment and supplement your own gear and powers but no guns.*

The weapons are :-

**Angry Birds Slingshot.** This device is lightweight and can magically summon the Angry Birds. The range is that of a normal child’s toy but the effects of the birds are potentially devastating. You can magically conjure up to :- 5 blue birds (splits to 3 and powerful enough to smash glass), 4 yellow birds (accelerates to gain more distance and powerful enough to smash through 2-3 planks of wood like a buzz saw), 2 black birds (They are bombs that detonate on ‘tap’), 1 giant red bird (expands into the size of a large cannonball and has the same mass), 5 green birds (Boomerang effect), 3 white birds (The drop bombs) and 20 regular red birds that hit has hard as rocks.

You can psychically ‘tap’ them to release their special abilities. Also they make their signature sounds after flung.



**Link’s Master Sword** and boomerang. The Master Sword will shoot fireballs only when the user is at perfect health. The user is required to make a large/heavy arching slash to shoot a fireball 40 cm in diameter. Once the user becomes hurt or very hungry due to not eating for a day s/he will be unable to shoot fireballs. The user must then heal the wounds and eat to regain strength in order to be able to use the sword’s special attack again. The boomerang is actually just a normal high quality and tough boomerang. Master Sword is enchanted and unbreakable. In addition using the sword to cut grass will sometimes give Hearts which can be eaten like food (Not heal wounds); on average you get 1 heart (as much nourishment as a cheeseburger) every ‘front lawns’ worth of grass you cut.



**Soul Edge**, the weapon transforms into a melee weapon (that means no guns) that you are most comfortable with. It is as light or heavy as you want it to be (Like your ideal perfect weapon/s). The power of the blade gives you enhanced reflexes and strength by 20% (You would notice the change but it won’t make you that superhuman).



**Gambit’s energy charge ability**, you can only charge objects up to the size of what you can hold in one hand. The explosions it creates are not always lethal but can severely injure your opponent. If it explodes in a person’s body it will tear away the skin and some flesh. It explodes next to someone it will injure their leg with some blunt force and scratches.

Takes 2 seconds to charge an item.

You are given 6 full decks of playing cards and an aluminum little league bat which you can charge with your ability. The impacts are 3X damage of your normal swing.


**Dragonborn Shouts**, you don’t have the stealth skills, melee or archery skills or magics. But you can still use shouts and they all come with their own cooldowns/recharge like in the game. They are:

[Unrelenting Force](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Unrelenting_Force)

[Whirlwind Spirit](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Whirlwind_Sprint)

[Kyne's Peace](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Kyne%27s_Peace)

[Fire Breath](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Fire_Breath)

[Storm Call](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Storm_Call)



**Sword of Omens from Thundercats**, this little baby grows when you chant, ""Thunder, Thunder, Thundercats... HOOOOOOO!!!!!!"" and is also lightweight and durable due to magic and alien tech. In addition it grants you 'Sight Beyond Sight' which allows you to see far away and obstructed areas (But you still gotta aim). This sword also comes with the claw gauntlet that fires out its claws up to 12 feet away and can latch onto trees or rocks to assist in climbing.


**Dagger of Time** 5 charges (MAX). Refillable through killing zombies. Usable as a weapon and durable. You can rewind time after death as it is linked to your soul. Rewinds time up to 5 minutes.

*Winner of the battle gets a free chicken dinner from the loser if they ever meet up IRL. :)*

Edit: Good question, what era borg/daleks? 

The Daleks, before the Time War, while they are at war with the First Great and Bountiful Human Empire for control of the Milky Way Galaxy

The Borg, before Encounter and Fairpoint, where they are still confined to the Delta Quadrent, but are a very powerful force there, and have never encountered Star Fleet

Edit 2: Only condition I can think to make the battle somewhat even is that there can be no time manipulation during the battle. In my initial scenario, the Daleks do not posess this ability, but as aescolanus pointed out, *right* before the time war, the Daleks had Time Lord like ability to manipulate time. 

This would be a battle of tactics, technology, cunning and firepower. 

~~We will say that aboard the two ships there are roughly the same number of individuals of either species. 5000 each.~~

After some consideration, I think that a single Dalek would annihilate a single Borg Drone. So let's give the Borg a numbers advantage, 5-1. 2500 Drones aboard the Cube. 500 Daleks aboard the Battle Cruiser. (If you disagree, of course go with whatever numbers you think reasonable!)

The yeerks will be at the peak of their power. Visser One is in control (Marco's mom), and Visser Three handles most of the dirty work.

Spy's invisibility will only fool zombies for a few seconds, as with the Dead Ringer, and disguises will not work.

EDIT: Uber is available, though Medigun only being able to be used for short bursts means it will take longer to build. Dispenser dispenses about 25% of the ammo it normally does at a much slower rate."	t5_2s599	True

1372861846.0	1hkgxd	Bane (TDKR) vs. Khan Noonien Singh (ST:TOS/Wrath of Khan)	RetroEyes	29	7	16	"Brutal. Tactician. Leader. Mastermind.

All words that can be used to describe both Bane from The Dark Knight Rises AND Khan Noonien Singh of the Original series of Star Trek and the follow up movie The Wrath of Khan. 

Who do we think the better fighter and leader is? 

**Round 1**

Both men have a small contingent of 12 of their henchmen at their disposal. Their objective is to lead their troops and come up with a plan to incapacitate a prepared Commissioner Gordon, who is holed up in the Gotham City police station. Batman is on leave somewhere and will not, for any reason, return for this fight. So it's just our contenders vs. potentially the majority of the Gotham City Police Dept. To win this fight, they will need to use tactics, good leadership skills and cunning.

**Round 2**

In this round, we will see both contenders fight in a no-holds barred fight in the middle of a city street. The simple contest is to see which one is stronger. The fight can only end in death. 

[Here is some information on Bane, which includes his abilities.]

In an effort to write Batman a better [set of rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1grj7r/the_5ish_rules_of_batman/), I have a request of you, my wonderful /r/whowouldwin minions. 

I need information on every time you know of that has seen Batman defeated, and what elements resulted in his defeat. Using this information, I will redo some things in the original 5(ish) Rules of Batman post, before finalizing it. 

Please help me by keeping things as short and detail-oriented as possible, and please include links, scans, and images wherever possible.

 * I know Bane beat Batman by breaking his back, thanks to being just as skilled in hand-to-hand combat, bigger, and stronger than Bats. This also saw Batman fighting while unprepared to face his foe. 

 * Deathstroke won by having superhuman physical ability and being more skilled than Batman in hand-to-hand. He also benefited from the element of surprise and catching Batman unprepared. 

I'll add more as they're listed. Thanks in advance to anyone who helps, I've never been a huge Batman fan, so I can't know nearly as much as some of you. "	t5_2s599	True

And since I started the [short story](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/1d1uaj/how_would_batman_win_against_scenario_x/) I figured I should just finish it based on the comments and suggestions from commentators.

**Batman** pulls up a screen from his computer to patch into the local news network. Images from a helicopter on what looks like some urban battlefield set in some country at war if not for the iconic sight of Wayne Towers in the picture. The frantic reporter on scene comments on the situation.

""What we have here is the national guard fighting some sort of superhuman in the middle of Gotham. Police and the fire department are currently working to evacuate the area."" a loud zoom can be heard over the broadcast, ""from the looks of it it seems that they have sent fighter jets to engage this guy. Looks like this will be all over quick folks!""

As the pilots take aim and let fly their missiles the Accelerator notices them and readies with a mad smile on his face, ""You think this is the first time I have fought armies? Laughable effort!""

The missiles are launched from the jets and as soon as they reach within the vector fields they are carefully deflected into the tanks who were creating a perimeter.

A second round of missiles inbound but not aimed directly at the Accelerator but the ground area around him this time.

""Think this is the first time people have tried that?"" Smirks the demi-god teenager.

As the missiles collide into the cement the boy is engulfed in flames.

""There you have it folks! This new threat has been dealt with without the help from capes and... oh dear lord! ZOOM IN CHAD!!!""

As the cameraman zooms into the area as the smoke and debris has cleared we can now visibly see that the Accelerator unharmed and smiling after that devastating attack.

""Computer! Match facial recognition with all know files starting with Asia."" Bruce yells.

""No matches found worldwide."" responds the computer.

""Might be another alien."" stands up from his seat and walks off to another section of the Batcave, ""Alfred, prepare the Batwing and tell Damien to assist with the evacuation of all personnel INCLUDING the national guard.""

""Including the national guard, sir? Are you sure this time against such an opponent would you not like some help?""

""No time to explain Alfred but just know that they are now doing more harm than good."" Batman leaps into the Batwing and it exits out the underground waterways and emerges out the east river.

""Uhh hey army guys!"" yells Robin to the man in uniform who looks like he's in charge, ""Yeah you! Batman says you guys gotta bail.""

""Are you FUCKING KIDDING ME?!?!? Someone get this kid out of here!"" the general in charge orders some of his men to escort Robin off the premises.

""Whoa whoa whoa! No need to get all touchy-feely man. We just want to help and we need you out of the way."" protest Robin.

""Ohh of all the arrogant gall! This isn't some guy with an umbrella or a guy with half his face burned off so unless you have Superman or the Green Lantern inbound I don't have anything else to say to you!""

As the general's men move to grab onto the boy wonder the agile young acrobat easily dodges the attempts and uses his grappling hook to escape to a nearby rooftop. he mumbles under his breath, ""Bet they would have listened if I were father!""

""Hmph! Nuisance capes!"" he picks up his radio receiver and begins to bark more orders, ""Alright men! looks like we can't go easy on him anymore and it's time to bring out the 'Big Gun'!""

""General!"" a voice from behind the shadows.

""Jesus Christ, Batman! You scared me.""

""... What is your plan of action?""

""Well since conventional weapons seem to just bounce off him like he's mutha-fucking Superman I got permission to bring in our special project! Wheel her in boys!""

Multiple vehicles start rolling in a large tarped object as the men pull off the tarp it is revealed to be ...

""A railgun?"" exclaims Batman in his head. A railgun that is mobile on land is rare, not to mention one in this size but that is not what worries him. This railgun in particular was designed by Waynetech as a counter-measure against Superman and the energy output is immense!

""Beauty isn't she?"" the general says as he admires the 20 ton weapon, ""Ok boys keep him preoccupied while we charge this bad boy up!""

Batman sees the look on the general's face and understands that talking to him would be fruitless and instead heads to the battle via rooftops.

""[This reminds me of my younger days!]"" the white haired boys proclaims as he adjust the vectors of gravity under the tank to flip it, ""[They just brought this on themselves! I did nothing wrong!]"" and he shield the while keeping the Accelerator safe from a storm of bullets.

""Somethings off about this..."" Batman presses some buttons on his wrist, ""Computer, recall local camera playback."" and computer replays the images onto the mask's display, ""Reduce playback speed by 99.5%"" the video slows down enough to actually see how the bullets bounce off Accelerator's body, ""Computer, calculate ricochet angles of bullets' original trajectory."" as the computer outlines the the normal course of bullets Batman finds that the bullets are definitely NOT ricocheting off. His experience with watching how bullets and other weapons bounce off Superman has been ingrained into his subconscious and he could immediately tell that the way bullets bounce off this boy was odd.

Batman presses more buttons on his wrist and then to his earpiece, ""General! Do NOT fire that weapon!""

""Wha...? Batman? This is a secure channel! Get off it!""

""No time! Just stop charging the weapon! He isn't just resistant to weapons, he's somehow reflecting them!""

""Well let's see him reflect this! FIRE!""

""Noooooo!!!"" but Bruce's protest are in vain as the weapon is at full charge and it shoots directly at the Accelerator, who is no stranger at all to railguns.

The white haired demo-god holds out his hand, open palmed towards the blast and slowly exhales. The powerful elector-magnetic weapon's charge is directed or should I say redirected towards the sky in an enormous flash of white light.

The general, upon seeing the feat and understanding what would have happened if the railgun had been redirected to a populated area slumps to the ground, ""Ohh dear lord. What have I done?""

""Not yet, general. So please ask your men to clear the area!"" Batman over the radio.

""Men... fall back. Leave it to the Batman.""

Batman uses his cape to glide towards the Accelerator.

Accelerator doesn't even notice the silent shadowy figure from above until it lands near him. he turn his head and is met with a sight that brings fear to criminals... and he laughs! ""[Buahhahahah! What is that? Are you a vampire-man?]""

""He's Japanese?"" Batman thinks as he understands the boy's language, ""[Boy, stand down!]""

""[Ehh? Finally someone who speaks Japanese! But why should I stand down just because you dress funny?]"" the Accelerator takes on the stance that shows arrogance and contempt, ""[Do you think I'm afraid of you?]"" with one hand he makes an obscene gesture and with the other pointing at the Batman.

*Now here we can easily just have Batman talk to Accelerator and just get him home. But that feels like such a cop out so I'm going to throw a monkey wrench in here so we can get to the actual beating.**

""Watch out Batman!"" screams the boy wonder as he throws some grenades and bladed projectiles at the Accelerator. Of course the projectiles simply have no effect on the Accelerator and the grenades are just smoke pellets and the most they do is provide a momentary inconvenience.

""[Kahk! What is this? Some trap?]""

""Robin! What are you doing? Get out of here!""

""Not this time Batman! I'm taking a piece of the action now."" Damien tries to land a glided kick on the Accelerator but is easily countered and falls flat on the floor.

Now agitated the Accelerator gives a swift kick to Robin's ribs and by manipulating Newton's 3rd law the kick comes off as more than double the force of a normal kick breaking at least one rib in the Boy Wonder.

""Robin!"" swiftly Batman rushes to Damien and scoops him up and uses his remote control on his wrist to call in the Batwing. He places Robin into the cockpit and send him on his way. After the jet leaves he turns back to the demi-god standing behind him staring daggers into at Batman.

""[How dare you!]"" the Accelerator manipulates the gravity beneath his feet and he does his namesake and he accelerates towards the Batman giving him a massive punch!

With no time to react properly to the extremely quick attack all he can do is use his cape's Kevlar to soften the blow and roll with the Herculean punch. Counter attacking he throws a batarang at the Accelerator's feet and activates it. Sonic batarang.

Horrible mind numbing sonics echo through the air and would normally knock out most people unless equipped with the filters batman has in his mask. But the white haired boy just stands there looking very angry.

""[Ahh that really hurt! Luckily I can filter sound into my personal shield. But you can't hear me can you?]"" Accelerator standing triumphantly in the face of Batman.

But Batman can understand what he is saying. Lip reading is useful and now he has another important clue. And he drops a flashbang to escape and buy time.

""[Argh! All you are doing is annoying me you weirdo!]"" stunned by the light the Accelerator rages.

""Alfred! Is Damien back at the Batcave?""

""Yes, master Bruce. Master Damien is back here all well and I am applying first aid as we speak. Even though he insist on returning to the field."" you can hear the sounds of Robin's protest over the call.

""Let him! And ask him to take the Batwing again and bring weapons coded of SCE09061 and JBC00001!""

""Sir? JBC00001? Isn't that...?""

""Yes I know Alfred. No time to explain just have Damien send them. Over and out.""

The steadfast butler grumbles, ""No time to explain. Always no time to explain but plenty of time to make me fetch this and patch up whom and so forth!"" as he wraps the bandages around Damian's torso, ""Now sit still boy! And don't forget after this we are getting you proper medical treatment!""

Batman now using his stealth to evade the superhuman teenager and some batarangs to distract and divide his attention waits for the drops he needs.

""[Hey hey! Where did you go you weirdo in that stupid costume?]"" Accelerator now smashing buildings down to their framework attempting to find the Batman, ""[You know... all I wanted was just to go back to Academy City! It was you westerners who attacked me!]""

""Westerners? Is he unsure as to where he is exactly? What  is this academy city?"" soon after one of the communicators alerts.

""Batman, Robin here. I have the drops."" overhead is the Batwing in stealth-VTOL mode and under the Batwing is a massive dome of sorts, ""Do you want them both now?""

""Drop the 'SCE' 30 yards behind me. I need to prepare and time this just right.""

""Roger, roger!"" and the Batwing silently moves to the position and drops a small package no larger than the size of a blue-ray player.

Batman scans the area in NVG mode, ""Hold on Robin, do you see that clearing north-east of the drop position?""

""Yeah, what of it? Drop it there?""

""Yes, but not yet. Head over there and stay in stealth mode until I give the signal."" and Batman stops communication  and finds a perch with a good angle and view of Accelerator, ""get ready Robin. Depending on what happens he will either run towards or away from me.""

""Say what now?""

Before Robin gets an answer Batman glides down toward his enemy, donning a gas mask and the dropped item in other hand, ""I only have one shot at this!"" and uncovers the  parcel to reveal what looks to be a small grenade of sorts, ""Let's hope Crane's formula works aerosolized.""

The Accelerator notices the small bomb at his feet but pays it no heed as no weapon can hurt him. It doesn't explode but actually merely discharges a thick cloud all over him. As a natural instinct he inhales partial breaths of the gas before using his powers to alter wind currents and pushes the gas clouds away, ""[Clever trick but not the first time someone has tried to use something like this on me. What is that? Tear gas? Knockout gas?]"" as the  clouds of Scarecrow gas are blown away he sees the figure in front of him and it gives him a shock and a slight fright, ""..."" and then what come after fear is anger, ""[YOU!!!]"" as he sees not Batman but the only person to have  actually beaten him. The 'Imagine Breaker' (Illusion killer) a.k.a. [Touma]( http://toarumajutsunoindex.wikia.com/wiki/Kamijou_Touma) !

""Robin, he looks mad. Looks like I will have to lure him. Get ready with the drop."" he informs Robin and while adjusting his stance and giving the Accelerator a challenging motion.

""[This time I will break you for sure!]"" and he dashes with augmented speed towards his phantom and leaps into the air, ""[Disappear from this world!]"" and dives in with a devastating kick!

If Batman had reacted just half a second too late the bones in his body would have been broken. He leaps back and twist mid jump and launches a grappling hook to a nearby building and reels himself to safety.

Accelerator not discouraged gives chase with a giants leap but Batman remains just out of reach again.

Batman runs the calculations in his head, ""Dome's wind resistance, rate of gradational pull..."" after the math is works out in his head he yells over the communicator, ""NOW!""

The dome drops towards the two and Batman releases 6 more bombs behind him and leaps just out of the dome covering area. The dome covers the frenzied Accelerator and the bombs explode releasing sleep gas.

The Accelerator instinctively tries to blow away the gas but to no avail in such an enclosed space. One breath in his panic causes him to feel dizzy.

Then he tries to punch through the metal dome and finds it much tougher than expected. Another breath which causes him to feel sleepy and the Scarecrow gas side effects of increased  heart rate help speed his metabolism more.

One last ditch effort is to adjust the vectors under he dome to lift it but finds that too is a long term plan as it the dome was welded shut into the ground. One last breath before he finally passes out.

Batman pours a liquid around the base of the dome all round its circumference, ""Ok Robin, lift it up!""

The dome now easily lifts off the ground and reveals a knocked out Accelerator. Batman checks for a pulse and when he finds one he removes a can from his belt  and sprays the contents onto the boy's face, ""That should be enough of a dose to keep him knocked out while we transport him somewhere safe. We need to keep him sedated so he can't use his abilities"""	t5_2s599	True

S.H.I.E.L.D. has an interest in using the DNA of these pokemon creatures for super soldier research. They send a task force to gain blood samples from some of the most powerful (dead or alive), and to kidnap their skilled owners (alive). The best target? Indigo Plateau, of course.

The Elite Four emerge to defend their Arena. They are not bound by the rules of standard pokemon fighting here, but are limited to only a few pokemon at a single time, depending on how many they can safely control at once. (It is fair to assume that their skill increases with rank, so assume they can each safely control one more than their weaker counterpart. If Lance can control 5 at once, Agatha can control 4, Bruno 3, Lorelai 2.)

The Avengers must subdue or kill all pokemon, gain blood samples from (or capture) each, and kidnap all four Elite Four members (alive) to complete their mission.

---

##Elite Four: 

**Lorelei**, *Ice Specialty*, 52 Dewgong, 51 Cloyster, 52 Slowbro, 54 Jynx, and 54 Lapras

**Bruno**, *Rock and Fighting Specialty*, 51 Onix, 53 Hitmonchan, 53 Litmonlee, 54 Onix, and 56 Machamp

**Agatha**, *Ghost and Poison Specialty*, 54 Gengar, 54 Golbat, 53 Haunter, 56 Arbok, and 58 Gengar

##Avengers:

*(Since we're using the movie version, they will be weaker than their comic version.)*

**Captain America**, Peak human in every way, has resistances to telepathy, poisons, and fatigue, exceptional battle strategist. Equipped with a vibranium-adamantium shield that can block any attack.

**Iron Man**, Seriously? You saw the movies. Power armor super-genius. Rockets and lasers, yo.

**Thor**, Movie version, so not as strong as usual. Weaker than Hulk but right behind him in durability. Lightning, hammer, arrogance.

**Black Widow**, Similar to Captain America, with a more mental-based super soldier serum. Pistols, ninja moves, S.H.I.E.L.D. tech.

**Hawkeye**, peak human, great accuracy, overall great fighter.

**Hulk**, The strongest, but limited. Probably slightly stronger than a Machamp, who can move a mountain with one hand. This is the one that has some control over himself. Think the version that knows to save New York, but still might punch Thor through a wall for no reason.

---

What is the outcome, and why?

##New Scenario Info

Since they share this world, we can assume that the abilities of both groups are at least somewhat common knowledge, but as S.H.I.E.L.D. is making this kind of move, we can guess they are fairly distant, and so they wouldn't have too much familiarity. They know about each other but not much. S.H.I.E.L.D. must have just recently found them, and must not have any yet. They probably saw some in action and decided they needed to act before another power did.

S.H.I.E.L.D. determines the risk is too great to wait for more intel, and decides to send in a team. Since they don't have the luxury of waiting for more data, they send their best team, just to be safe.
I'd say... three days of prep time for S.H.I.E.L.D.. Enough to account for reaction time and threat assessment, as well as to gather all the Avengers from their various locations. Banner, Cap, Widow, and Hawkeye are all more or less constantly-present S.H.I.E.L.D. assets, but Tony and Thor are a little more difficult to get a hold of.

Let's say the Avengers have the element of surprise, but they only know that the pokemon are dangerous, powerful, mutant-like animals with a variety of unknown abilities. They know these are highly skilled beasts with highly skilled trainers.

The Elite Four only have a few minutes to prepare, but as they may be challenged at any time, they are always somewhat ready for battle, and all their pokemon are fully rested. 

They see the hellicarrier in the distance, and eventually place it as an American super-military vehicle. When they see the Avengers, they run to confront them. The E4 know the Avengers from the news, so they have an idea of who they are and what they're capable of, but no specifics. Tony, of course, is very well-known worldwide, as is Cap. Hulk surely made the global news a few times. Hawkeye and Widow have the advantage of relative anonymity, and thus wouldn't be known at all by the E4.

Neither side knows about weaknesses, and would have to learn in battle which pokemon are weak against which type, and what each Avenger is weak against. It is important to note that Captain America would likely choose to attempt takedowns of the trainers to prevent them from instructing their pokemon. This means the trainers will either be vulnerable to attack or they will have to use at least one of their pokemon to defend themselves."	t5_2s599	True

In a freak incidence, the characters from both Playstation Allstars Battle Royale &amp; SSBB are warped onto this field after simultaneously defeating Master Hand and Polygon Man, thus breaking their areas of existance.

The champions are at level 15 and have their pro builds in the making (based on where they generally go in each game (top, jung, etc.).

The Smash Bros deal damage on the scale 100% : 400 HP but cannot use final smashes, but have access to a scarce amount of maximum tomatoes on the ground (let's say about 15).

Each member of the league can use the ""heal"" and ""flash"" powers but do not have potions. They however CANNOT use ultimate abilities (removing final smashes as well as both make for incalculable x-factors in battle)

I'm not entirely sure how the damage system works in PS All-Stars, but it'll be on a similar conversion factor to that of the SSBM characters. They also cannot use any special attacks above level 1 (those special attacks like when Sweet Tooth gets that mech).

3) A situation in which [The Flood](http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Flood) is unleashed upon the ring and both factions, necessitating either overwhelming firepower or an effective withdrawal, potentially even the destruction of the ring.

There are some that come up fairly often in threads, so lets name them off the bat: Downstreamers, Time Lords, Xeelee, Forerunner, and Culture.  Who else can we add to the list?

I would say the 4th Empire/5th Imperium from the Dahak series of novels by David Weber.

The 4th Empire at its height had nearly a million Planetoid class ships under its command.  A Planetoid class ship, as its name implies, is huge.  They are literally the size of Earths moon or bigger. Planetoids are armed with hyper-missiles with warheads ranging from chemical, fusion, gigaton yield antimatter, and planet/star destroying gravatonic warheads. Hyper-missiles have a ranges measured in light minutes. Not to mention the numerous beam weapons for close in fighting.  They can accelerate to .7c in seconds on normal reaction-less drives, have real-space FTL, or FTL hyperdrives.  

On the flip side,  who should we stop from fighting 40k because they are just not strong enough?

1369343183.0	1exfjm	The Bat-Beauty Contest	EvaQuaver	23	5	60	"""Batman always wins with prep time.""

Challenge accepted.

Bruce Wayne is visited by the Presence itself. He is told that there will be a beauty contest to decide the fate of the multiverse. If Batman wins, it will stay. If anyone else wins, it will all disappear (effectively killing everyone and everything that has ever existed) and the Presence will create something new in it's place. The rules are as follows:

1.) Batman has infinite prep time (he can hold off for forty years or more if he wants t.), but attempting to build something to defeat the Presence (even in indirect methods such as time travel) or prevent the contest results in Batman forfeiting and the multiverse is destroyed.  All the other contestants get prep time Equal to Batman's, as time continues to pass as normal while Batman prepares.

2.) Batman is not allowed to cheat- no attacking the other contestents, no sabotage, no mind control devices on the audience, no altering his body with holograms, no replacements, no pheromones, etc. Other than that he can use his resources any way he wants.

3.) Batman is allowed to tell the other contestants the multiverse is at stake. If he does, it turns out the other contestants have all been told the same thing by the Presence. The Presence was only telling the Truth to Batman. He is not, however, allowed to tell anyone else that the multiverse is at stake (including the audience), or he forfeits and the multiverse is destroyed.

4.) Batman is not allowed to switch bodies with anyone (Including versions of himself from other universe) or pick a stand-in. He must win the contest in his own body by his own merits. He can, however, alter it to the limits of science should he choose to do so.

5.) Batman is competing against: Batwoman, Harlequin, Tig, Rose Wilson, Pandora, Starling, Wonder Woman, Powergirl,  Isabel Ardila, Atlee, Starfire, Supergirl, Jade, Maxima, Hawkgirl, Donna Troy, Zatanna, and Black Canary. For some reason Superman is also competing (though he is of course not altering himself in any way) for a total of 20 participants.

6.) As is standard for Beauty contests, the audience consists of a few thousand people from all over the universe; mostly straight men and lesbian women (with exceptions).  The format of the Pageant is slightly akin to the Miss Universe competition: Streetwear &gt; Swimsuit &gt; Talent &gt; Evening Gown &gt; The Final Question. At each ""&gt;"" 4 individuals are cut from the contest leaving only 4 for the Final Question.

7.) The Final Question (Should he make it there) is an altered version of one from one of the Miss Universe contests: ""What would you say to those who condemn the contest as an affront to morality?""

1. Every athlete is in the best physical and mental condition they were ever in throughout the course of their athletic career.
 
2. The athletes are fighting in an ovular arena 287 feet long and 180 feet wide (the dimensions of the Roman Colosseum). The floor is concrete. Assume that weather is not a factor.

3. Each athlete has been given one standard-issue [Gerber LHR Combat Knife](http://www.knifecenter.com/item/GB0183/Gerber-LHR-Combat-Knife-687-inch-Fixed-Blade-Reeve-and-Harsey-Design-Strap-On-Sheath). Assume the athletes have no training outside any combat experiences they may have had in their own lives.

4. There is no penalty for avoiding combat for an extended period of time. Hiding and/or playing dead could be valid strategies, but there can be only one winner. The melee will go on as long as it needs to.

5. Each athlete will be deposited in the arena regardless of their own will to fight, however, personal ethics, leadership ability, tactical expertise etc., should all be taken into account. Alliances are allowed.

Edit:

6. Equestrian athletes are not allow to bring their horses. That would be an extremely unfair advantage.

Han Solo has had a bad day.

He just wants to take in a quiet drink and calm down.

Rick Deckard has had a bad day.  He finally got off-planet and what happens?  His ship goes off course and he gets stranded on this unknown planet with only his wallet and sidearm.  He just wants to have a quiet drink while he starts making plans.

Indiana Jones has had a bad day.  He cut his way through a jungle, dodged a dozen and a half traps, and had to deal with the incessant screeching of that blonde for longer than he cared to remember, and when he finally finds the mystical macguffin it up and transports him to an unknown planet.  At least the locals have something akin to alcohol.  He just wants a quiet drink to help sort out what's happened to his life.

The Chosen Ones from Xiaolin Showdown get an alert of a mysterious anomaly that appears to resemble a new Shen Gong Wu revealed. Upon travelling to a strange land they encounter the anomaly - Samurai Jack's magic sword. Jack knows that he cannot win this fight with words and so must do battle with these four warrior monks. The Chosen Ones brought with them their signature Shen Gong Wu:

**Omi - Orb of Tornami**

**Kimiko - Star Hanabi**

**Raymundo - Sword of the Storm**

**Clay - Fist of Tebigong**

There are no xiaolin showdowns. No mercy. Only a brutal fight.

As a small note, the toonforce that appears to exist in xiaolin showdown is negated here; whilst the powers and kung-fu prowess of the chosen ones are allowed, nothing too over the top is considered in this. Same with Samurai Jack.

[Here's some info on the Chosen Ones in case no one knows about Xiaolin Showdown - I don't really know how popular it is.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaolin_Showdown)

2) Clayface is discovered and the real fight is on.

For the first year it would be hell on earth. It subdues after a year. A member dies when Satan spits in his face. 

For the second year a nuclear apocalypse happens and you lose one member. He/She saved you from getting killed by the nuke. 

For the third year a Zombie Apocalypse happens and you lose a member. You pick how he dies. 

For the last year a little civilization starts and Aliens come and take over and civil war starts between the humans. You pick the member of your team to die. 

Only rule is no god characters. 

My team: 1. The Joker. He would be the first to die. He would be the character that kinda betrays us sometimes but only because he thinks that Batman or Superman is gonna save the world. But He's wrong and dies like a fool. 

2. Kenny from South Park. He was very loyal from the beginning and is the leader of the group until you came along. He dies and leaves you with the group.

3. Saeko Busujima from Highschool of the Dead. She hates you with a passion for becoming leader in Kenny's place. But soon respects you. She starts to fall in love with you and makes love to you before her death. She dies from a stroke. Her death still haunts you till this day.. 

4. Doom Guy from Doom is the last person to die and dies from saving you and the rest of the group from the various war going on. 

5. Captain Falcon is field leader and is responsible for getting food and other various items. 

6. Last but not least Michael Jackson. I originally had Fleetway's Super Sonic but decided that MJ would be a funny but great choice. His moves would be from moonwalker the game, and he helps keep the team up when they're down. 


EDIT: I just wanna clarify some things. OP characters aren't bad but I must request that you not use them. The reason being is that characters like Superman, Goku, and Sentry are all OP characters and will make the Apocalypse less dramatic, exciting, and will guarantee survival. So I have to request that you guys kill the OP characters if you must use them. But that's a request and you don't have to do what I say. I'm gonna you guys some rules for Goku and Superman if you have to use these specific characters. 

1. Goku is a kid and he can use the power pole and can not use ki. He can use the Kamehameha and cannot fly.

2. Superman is Superboy, and is limited to his abilities. He can't fly and only has super strength and heat vision.

Dexter, having no knowledge of Westerosi customs, culture or politics, spends a few months ingratiating himself with the smallfolk of a small village, and hears of Ramsay Bolton and the atrocities he is committing at the Dreadfort.

But no prep time to set up the mines; he'll have to do it on the fly if he does it at all. Neither have any medigel or repair kits, so no healing.

HK is as he was at the end of KOTOR2, and Legion is at the end of ME2. Both are at maximum level.

Now, second fight, you are allowed one super power, it can be as limitless as possible, but it cannot directly affect Batman, IE, you can't make him explode, if you have telekinesis, you cannot lift Batman.

Okay, I'm working on the ranking system, since there's been a lot of problems with the original 7-stat, 7-point system. I really don't know how to implement a new one, since it would involve editing over 130 charts, submitted by... I think there's seven of us. Still, I wanted to at least put the scale out there so we can work on it, and if we can perfect it, then I'll figure out a way to edit all the charts. So, I'm thinking a 10-stat, 0-10 scale. The rough draft is below. Tell me what you think, and let's fix what's broken.




__________________________________________________________

##Possible rules/changes, share your thoughts.

 * I was thinking of rounding to the nearest point and writing specifics in the Specials section of each character's chart. This allows for more accurate ratings and fewer problems with the absurd ranges we have to use.

---

 * Rule 1: Any stat of a 0 or a 10 must be awarded very carefully. If you have any doubt at all, use something else.

 * Rule 2: I don't think there are any more rules.

10 Reserved for the rare occasion that a fighter either has every possible weapon from every possible universe. (An exceptional Green Lantern would earn a 10)


**Danger**

*A way to show the destructive force behind a character. This is a modifier intended to be used with the other stats in order to accurately portray the intensity of abilities. (Example: Magneto. Though he would score a 5 in energy projection, his control over it and massive power reserves allow him the destructive force of an atomic bomb. This stat has room for improvement, but until any input is received, this is the way it is.)

##Rejected Stats

**~~Luck~~**

*Percent chance of luck positively influencing their battle. Possible stat. I was planning to use it to help determine outcomes, but I'm not married to the idea. Actually, the more I look at it, the less I like it. Up to you guys.*

~~0~~ None; Reserved for Fighters with uncanny misfortune. Murphy's Law governs their life.

~~1~~ Extremely Unlucky; 1-10% chance

~~2~~ Very Unlucky; 11-20% chance

~~3~~ Highly Unlucky; 21-30% chance

~~4~~ Unlucky 31-40% chance

~~5~~ Average. 50-50% chance (Most fighters would rank here.)

~~6~~ Lucky. 51%+ chance unaided.

~~7~~ Able to slightly influence probability.

~~8~~ Able to heavily influence probability.

~~9~~ Able to control luck itself.

~~10~~ Reserved for the truly omnipotent.

***This stat was rejected because I don't like it, and no one else seems to like it either. It looks like everyone agrees that Luck plays an important role in battle, but that it should be accounted for separately from the charts, in the Special/Other section or at the choreography stage.***

The man unveils from behind his back a folder. On the cover in thick black ink reads ""HYPER LETHAL"".

""How much are you worth, Slade?""

The man doesn't even know what happened next. He's already on the floor, a bullet right between his eyes. Slade hasn't let himself be 'hired' in years. He takes a look at the folder anyway, opening it up. 

Pictures and files spill out, all speaking of a man named John. No last name given. Hard to find, and even harder to kill. High body count. Widely accepted as a hero. 

The last file claims that a reward is being given for his head. The price makes even Slade bat his one eye. Whoever he just shot wasn't the only one who wanted John dead. 

Two weeks was all it took for Slade to locate him. A flash of lightning revealed the massive figure the man bore. Slade cared not to know why this 'John' was on a mountainside, only that he never left it. Rain pattering off of his new NTH armor, Slade reaches for his auto-pistol and unsheathes his sword.

____________________
The figure across the snow had been on John's radar for at least two minutes. He was being given the benefit of the doubt. That of course ended when the sword was drawn. This couldn't take long. Cortana's signal was bleeping nearby, and whether this stranger wanted Chief dead, or was also here for her didn't matter. He had to be eliminated either way. John snatched the battle rifle off of his back and took aim.

_____________
All right guys, tell me who wins. I'll finish the little story after a day or so, and whoever I believe had the better argument going for them will be the victor. 

Just in case you need them, here are more details:

The arena is a mountainside. Rocky, snowy, but it happens to be storming during the fight. Chief is in Mark 6 MJOLNIR, with a Battle Rifle and an Assault Rifle. Deathstroke is in NTH armor with his sword, lance, and an auto-pistol.

Egypt:
Howling sandstorms reduces visibility to near zero so relying on your system senors is key to survival.

1373913700.0	1icu7f	Godzilla Stats: Size, Strengths, and Weaknesses.	jade-E	21	6	4	"I've seen an increased interest in using Godzilla in matches lately, probably due to the increased popularity in kaiju from *Pacific Rim*, but I've also seen that a lot of people aren't aware of the monster's [various] size and capabilities. I'm probably not *the* top expert on the dinosaur, but I've been watching his movies since I was a toddler and have a pretty good grasp on him; so I think I can accurately lay this out. 

So very generally Godzilla was a living fossil dinosaur who was mutated by the radiation from the atomic bombs and various nuclear testing in the 1940s-1950s. He grew to massive size, and almost always has an atomic-energy ray breath and super regenerative healing ability in addition to his super-strength and natural dinosaur-abilities/attacks.  

Godzilla movies have certain 'ages' or generations in the same manner as comics. Just as there was a golden/silver age Batman, there were similar moments for Godzilla. I guess it's easier to say that just as there were different James Bonds throughout the years who've had different tones and skill sets, so have there been for the big green guy as well. I'll help lay out the different 'ages' of the beast, and his various size and abilities he has in each respective time period.

There's the classical Showa Age Godzilla: This is Godzilla from the original 1954 movie all the way to 1975 in ""Terror of MechaGodzilla."" This Godzilla (save for the first two films) is a little campier, and also not as powerful as other incarnations.  This is the one who was beaten by [Toho super-powered] King Kong; and you could equate this one to the campier goldne/silver age Batman: powerful, but a bit goofy and not all that serious.

**[Showa Godzilla:](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3I5VFc4QIIA/Te0itaMg6dI/AAAAAAAAA8Q/od4fcfVTZi4/s400/Godzilla_biography.jpg)** is about 50 meters (165 feet) tall. He has atomic breath, super-regenerative power, and is somewhat skilled in martial arts/kung-fu. 

Then there's the Heisei Age which is the late 1980s-1990s. This Godzilla has the most popular design (we use it as our flair here) one people most commonly refer to in match-ups in this sub. Additionally, he is also among the most powerful of the different Godzilla incarnations because of his sheer size and raw power. 

**[Heisei Godzilla:](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54632/1545684-968132_godzilla_super.jpg)** 100 meters (330 feet) tall, can blast an atomic ray (as well as a super-charged 'atomic spiral ray)', give off a destructive nuclear pulse, has super regeneration, and can absorb radiation and energy from defeated foes/allies for his own benefit. 

The Millenium Age (2000-2005) had a bunch of one-shot standalone continuity Godzilla movies, and had 5 generations of Godzilla, three of them being pretty much the same one. 

**[Godzilla Generation 1,2, and 4:](http://skreeonk.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/megs5.jpg)** 55 meters (180 feet) tall, has an atomic ray, super regenetive power, razor spines unleash and intense amount of heat while charging his nuclear blast, and can unleash a blast of nuclear radiation from within his body. 

**[Godzilla Generation 3:](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l0zhfhOsFy1qzr8nao1_1280.png)** 65 meters (215 feet) tall, has the strongest base-atomic ray (the power of a medium scale atomic bomb), a near impenetrable hide, can absorb defeated enemy energy for regeneration or to power up an even stronger atomic blast. Possibly a [slow-acting] regenerative ability, and may be immortal. 

**[Godzilla Generation 5:](http://images.wikia.com/godzilla/images/a/a2/Godzilla-final-wars.jpg)** This Godzilla is *the* strongest incarnation of the atomic dinosaur yet and because his film [*Godzilla: Final Wars*] was a celebration of all things Godzilla, he is a mixture of all three ages [Showa, Heisei, and Millenium] of the kaiju. 

He is 100 meters (330 feet) tall, has his atomic breath (as well as his special powered-up 'hyper spiral breath'), super-regenitive power, and can discharge a blast of nuclear energy to those in direct contact with him. He also seems to have some of that kung-fu skill the Showa Godzilla had, and is also the most slender, fastest, and agile [Japanese] Godzilla yet, being able to run and jump great distances and heights. 


* * *

**Weaknesses**

Due to his super-regenerative ability, Godzilla is near impossible to kill and has very few weaknesses. Think of him as a giant, dinosaurian Hulk with ranged attacks as well. Still, even besides certain, specific weaknesses he can still get very hurt with enough [insanely intense] damage (though he will just often recover very quickly). 

**Showa Godzilla:** The original Godzilla was defeated by a device called the ""Oxygen Destroyer,"" which big surprise, destroyed all of the oxygen in a certain nearby area. This is the only Godzilla seem to be affected by it, but it is highly effective against him. 

**Heisei Godzilla:** After showing nearly no weaknesses throughout his entire run, his ultimate downfall was absorbing so much intense radiation over the years (and finally way too much from an erupting volcano) that he became a walking nuclear meltdown. While ultimately doomed from this, he becomes [Burning Godzilla](http://www.angelfire.com/ego/g_saga/BurningGodzilla01.gif) for a while, a super-charged and super-powered monster in its prime and strongest form, who is invincible before his internal body temperature reaches 1200 degrees and he implodes/explodes. 

**Millenium Godzilla 1,2, and 4:** No specific weaknesses, though at one point they tried to put him in a black hole to move him [didn't work], and another time destroy him with an abosulte-zero canon [also didn't work]. 

**Millenium Godzilla 3:** No specific weaknesses. After taking on three kaiju single-handedly and the Japanese armed forces, a small gash was in his body where a drill-missile was launched into him and tears out his heart. However, the closing image of the film was his heart still beating, insinuating that Godzilla was [slowly] recovering. 

**Millenium Godzilla 5:** No specific weaknesses. He was frozen once and kept dormant under a bunch of glaciers in Antarctica for a few years, but a disturbance woke him up and he escaped.

1373309205.0	1hvpo9	Dexter Morgan versus Patrick Bateman (Spoilers for both inside)	dexterbateman	18	2	11	"Ok, I have searched this sub and haven't been able to find anything along the lines of this fight. In my opinion, this would be one of the greatest showdowns of all time.
   
First spoiler: All of this is done assuming that Bateman did in fact commit all those murders, none of it was in head, etc. All that was in the novel/movie actually happened. Also of note, this is after the end of the movie/novel.

Second spoiler: Dexter is in his prime, around season four or five. He is still living his double life and Deb hasn't found him out yet.

Premise: Dex heads to NYC for a blood conference, and hears rumors about various people involved in Wallstreet missing. After a bit of snooping, he arrives at a club, where he sees a man enter a bathroom with a woman, then leave alone a few moments later. Dex enters the bathroom, finds the woman dead and covered in cocaine. Dex follows Bateman to his apartment, and, the next day, while Bateman is working, Dex breaks in to get the evidence he needs to kill him. He finds what he needs, and begins to plot his kill. Bateman comes home that night and finds that his Huey Lewis and the News albums out of order. He consoles a small camera he keeps behind his stereo and sees Dex snooping around on camera. He recognizes Dex from the club and seeks him out, telling him to back off.

So, Dex has one week to prepare for his kill. He has his typical gear (Knives, saw, duct tape, M99, etc) and Bateman has his pistol, butcher knife and chainsaw. Bateman has all of NYC to draw him out, and Dex has to hunt him down. Dex does not have to do his ritual (knock out, tie to a table, anyone who has seen the show knows) but neither one can just off the other in public. Personally, I think that Dexters patience and tracking skill would ultimately win out, but Bateman would not leave Dex unscathed. Still I am curious as to what Reddit thinks.

First off the Robin I will be using will be Tim Drake. Sorry Damian and Stephanie Brown, Carrie Kelly fans. :( Anyway Batgirl will be Oracle and Donatello will serve as basically the way Oracle does. Now I read the TMNT comics the original (I'm on issue 10) and Donatello is not really like he is in the comics. So decided that we are gonna use Animated series counterparts, all of them. But that is only so might be equal with the Oracle. Now lets begin with the rules. 

Rule 1. No prep time, The Bat Family meets the 
turtles in the sewers after just defeating Killer Croc but they are not tired at all and are ready to fight. 

Rule 2. Barbara Gorden aka Batgirl is a cripple and will be serving as Oracle in this fight. Basically giving support to the Bat Family fighting the turtles. Donatello will serve the same as Oracle in the fight. Donatello will be at the lair, same goes to Oracle. 

Rule 3. I guess this is not a rule but I just wanna educate people who are quick to say the Turtles will lose. (It's your decision on who you think would win)  The Turtles are really good at fighting with no prep time. From just reading the comics they seem really fantastic at fighting aliens, human, etc. From a first encounter.

REAL Rule 3. I guess we can say to the death. But it will be in three encounters with turtles that they decide to execute one another. The First they spar a little, The second they fight together, and they last they fight to the death. The Bat Family did not prepare for this. Because did not think to see them so many times. It sounds a little out of character I guess.  

Rule 4. The Turtles have all their basic equipment swords, sais, and nunchaku. Also throwing stars, and smoke pellets. I don't know all of the Ninja Turtles equipment but that is what we are gonna use. The Family will have their basic equipment. Bladed Batarangs, Bo Staff, escrima sticks, explosive batarangs, rolling explosives, and Smoke Pellets. Again I don't know all of the Bat Family's equipment so this is what we are gonna use. 

Rule 5. No help from friends, of course. So turtles can not have Casey or anyone of that matter. Same for the Bat-Family. 

Rule 6. The Bats can only use Rolling Explosives to put the Turtles on edge. The comment below explains why.

We've begun writing the rough drafts for several exhibition matches. (Just show-fights, more or less.) The soonest of these should be finalized and ready to be shown in the coming month or two, depending on the availability of myself and the Tournament Staff. 

A long time ago, I polled this subreddit and asked about matches that would be fun to have written out and choreographed. The tie for first place was **Peter Pan vs Westley** *(Princess Bride)* and **Rambo vs Xenomorph** *(Alien)*. Both of these are being worked on and one will be out as soon as it's ready. At that time, we hope to get feedback so we can refine our writing style before writing any real Tournament matches. 

I noticed you all enjoyed the Fictional Metal Reference Chart quite a bit. I'm glad it was useful, I wasn't sure when I made it. It wasn't originally going to be a part of the Tournament, but it will eventually be redone so we can link to special charts for the metals from the character charts and vice-versa. 

Thank you all for filling up the Tournament Character Registration list with so many people. (You can stop, now, for a while, please.) And thank you yet again to those of you sending in charts, they will be finalized and added to the main list in the coming days.

We have a new sidebar with links. Look and read.

I've had a couple questions about the Tournament Staff and some people are interested in volunteering. Right now, we *are* in need of several superb action writers, and we have jobs that are waiting for illustrators/cartoonists/artists, animators, and graphic designers. (There is also a small need for experts in firearms, weaponry, and martial arts, but we plan to involve specialty subreddits for specialty knowledge bases in the future.) If anyone is interested in joining the staff and donating their time and talents to the Tournament, please send me a private message asking about the role you'd like to fill. We will need to see samples of your relevant work and it may take time to get back to you. Don't panic. As you can see, I've got a lot going on.

Other than that, I'm thrilled so many people are getting involved and I really can't thank you all enough. I know I say it a lot, but this is going to get as big as you guys want it to get. There's only so much I can do, and writing's really the only talent I have. I have plenty of ideas for this Tournament, all I need is people with the right skills. Feel free to ask any questions or discuss things below, I'll be around now and then as I have time to be online.

Thanks to /u/rph39 for suggesting this was interesting enough to merit it's own post! (Editted this post to add this line. Sorry.)

**Round 1**

Blue Beetle and Ironman first meet with no prior knowledge of each other. The Scarab identifies Ironman as a serious threat, pointing out to Jaime the amount of weapons and apparent siege design of the default Ironman suit (Let's say Extremis era). Ironman is intrigued by the Beetle's tech up until the point where shots are fired. Who Would Win?

Fight takes places in a populated city but neither is in proximity to call on their allies.

**Round 2**

After the initial fight, the two manage to escape each other. Jaime is called off on a mission for the League and convinces the Scarab to back down. Ironman backs off once the Beetle is in safe enough range. Two weeks pass before the next fight. Ironman, as he often does when facing a new enemy, gets to work on a suit to counter the Beetle. He doesn't have enough time to create an entirely new suit, but can adapt one of his current suits. Blue Beetle's mission is also logging a tremendous amount of battle time, taking big steps towards having him and the Scarab in sync. What suit does Ironman use? What new Scarab ability does Beetle come back knowing after fighting for a week straight? Who Would Win?

Fight is in the same city as round 1.

**Round 3**

Years pass. Ironman now knows about Blue Beetle and the Scarab well enough through their fights to devise an entirely new suit devoted to it. Jaime has nearly mastered the Scarab's abilities and has come close to completely overriding the Reach orders built in. At this point, the two probably know that neither is 'the bad guy' but upon learning of Ironman's Beetle Smasher suit, tensions rise and the last remaining scraps of the Scarab's aggressiveness prod Jaime into attack mode. Who Would Win?

The fight starts in Stark Tower, the two casually discussing and reminiscing of that oh so silly time when they fought each other. Fight ensues.

**Bonus Round**

Ironman's Beetle Smasher suit and Blue Beetle's honed abilities with the Scarab are attacked by a hoard of Reach Scarab-using Conquerors. Who takes the most out?

The invasion is met in the Upper Atmosphere.

**Bonus Bonus Round**

Weapon Types




 * Conventional weapons will mean knives, guns, and other consumer-level weapons. (Each weapon from this category gets 1 point if it has short range, 2 points if it has a moderate range, and 3 points if it has a long range.)




 * Exceptional weapons will include Military and Special weapons. (Each weapon from this category gets 2 points for short range, 4 points for moderate range, and 6 points for long range. Special cases may be assigned additional points if adequate reasoning is provided and the Staff agrees.)




[*Military weapons will include any _existing_ human weapons unavailable to the general public.*]




[*Special weapons will be fantasy weapons with unnatural abilities or properties. (Magic, highly advanced, supernatural, etc.)*]




 * Hyper-weapons will be any weapon from any other category capable of a bare minimum of destruction on a continental scale. (Massive supernukes, Ultimate Nullifier, etc.) Each Hyper-weapon will be given a number value individually depending on it's abilities. The minimum score for a single Hyper Weapon will be 20.




All weapons a fighter is equipped with must be listed in the Special/Other section. They will then be analyzed and placed into one of the above categories. 


**Danger**

*A way to show the destructive force behind a character. This is a modifier intended to be used with the other stats in order to accurately portray the intensity of abilities. (Example: Magneto. Though he would score a 5 in energy projection, his control over it and massive power reserves allow him the destructive force of an atomic bomb. This stat has room for improvement, but until any input is received, this is the way it is.)

0 None; incapable of causing damage.

1 Poor; Able to do very little damage.

2 Normal; capable of the same damage any unarmed human could do.

3 Abnormal; Able to kill with one attack.

Edit: A lot of great responses already.  I happen to agree that Warrior would win, but there's one variable that no one really has mentioned.  I've found that Conjuration, for the Mage class, is an overpowered ability that could somewhat level the playing field; the ability to toss out two Dremora Lords might be huge.  They act as meat shields that absorb hits and allow the mage to keep his distance, plus they deal out probably more damage with a single hit than most Destruction spells, and they can be resummoned the moment they die."	t5_2s599	True
1367525188.0	1dkm5r	[Meta] Lets talk range!	Leefan	26	10	6	"In a fight to the death environment can be a big factor. One we tend to ignore unfortunately. Because if you put two people up against each other that fight differently(grapple fighter VS standing/boxing fighter), or are superior to their opponents in different ranges, the winner could be decided on the range.(Luffy VS Green Arrow)

I purpose a system or rating on range, that OP could include, or that people could ask questions on to pick their winner. (like well in range 2 batman would win but in range 4 I have to give it to generator Rex)

I purpose a 6 zones/sets of range. Here is my idea, I would like constructive criticism or to know what people like or dislike.

**1)** At the very most a foot and half away from each other, or on the ground. This is where MMA fighters and ground fighters would excel. That is because this is where headbutts, elbows, knees, biting, and wrestling on the ground would be most useful. (So a boxer or someone who does Isshinryu would prob not be at their best here, but someone who wrestles or does MMA, or an animal that doesn't require a pounce would do great here.)

**2)** At the most a leg and a half distance from one another. So this is where volleys of good punches, well preformed kicks, and blocks that are effective take place. It is where a martial artist who does a boxing style as apposed to a grappling style would excel. It is also where a sword fighter would like to be. Or a big cat that is best at pouncing. (Like a tiger or something) But someone who requires a little bit of range (like a ninja from Naruto that uses a lot of handsigns but not much taijutsu) wouldn't do great, and if you put say an MMA fighter in here they would probably try to close the distance to get into zone one, while a traditional martial artist or boxer would probably try and keep them back or try retreating gradually to stay in zone 2.

**3)** About 100 feet away is the max to zone 3. The idea I have is beyond this range shotguns, handguns, throwing weapons, and crossbows are ineffective. This is where a lot of lower tier superheros are most effective. (For instance a lot of Naruto ninjas, One piece characters, Bleach characters, and lower level DC and marvel heroes like Static Shock or whatever, would be at their best. They would probably eventually advance to zones 1 and 2, or distance out to zone 4 though.)

 **4)** This range goes up to about 3 miles. **Beyond** this range, snipers, and most guns are not usable. But someone like Superman could fight in this range no problem, because he has heat vision, and the speed to enter and exit this range easily. 

**5)** This is the kind of range that countries fight at. (North Korea VS USA) It is where tanks, the most expensive missiles, or Superman sitting inside of a sun using laser vision might fight you. 

**6)** This is like god range. It is included for insurance purposes. It is like if superman flew into a blue sun and stayed there for months and was able to laser-vision to kill people across the galaxy or some crazy shit. Or if god himself wanted to kill you. Or if we wanted to talk range on Kira's deathnote. 

Looking forward to your feedback, and hoping I might see range talked about a bit more in this sub.

**Background:**

Tony was able to create a working suit of high tech armor with a computer interface and a load of weapons that was able to outmatch a fully armed terrorist camp with scrap missile parts while in captivity. Time span was likely a few months. With his full resources, Tony developed the Iron Man suit with tech far beyond the military's capability. This is in 2008.

Doc Brown was able to create, among other things, a working ice machine in 1885 using the scarce resources of California at the time. With his full resources he has developed the first working time machine and made it able to function within a car without making the car inoperable. This is in 1985.

--**Remember**-- This is movie-verse Tony. He's excellent by any standard but he's not nearly as unbelievably good as the comic book version and even the Mark I Iron Man needed palladium to be made, not likely to find that here.

**EDIT:** Let me clarify. The Delorean isn't part of the contest. Previous inventions are only there as reference. They have a set of key tools and all the scrap they could possibly need. Who would create the better device by the end of the time limit? No time travel!

Kurt Wagner (Nightcrawler) vs Remy LeBeau (Gambit)

**Setting the stage:** 

A dark courtyard at night with direct window access to surrounding buildings and a series of planters for trees and bushes (think generic Splinter Cell multiplayer map). Objective is to knock out or otherwise incapacitate the other in a dark environment, promoting their stealth tendencies. Nightcrawler is equipped with 3 sabres and his standard X-Men gear. Gambit is equipped with his Thieves' Guild provided suit (default X-Men appearance w/ freon coolant tubes laced throughout), his trenchcoat, as many card decks as he can carry and his telescoping Bo staff, along with any thieves tools he may have.

**Key points to remember:**

-Both are exceptional at stealthy combat but Nightcrawler has the advantage insomuch as his mutation literally blends him with shadows. However, Gambit, as a professional thief, is likely more resourceful with distraction and misdirection.

-The setting helps both fighters. Gambit by giving him a variety of random objects (trashcans, rocks, dirt, etc.) and hallways in adjacent buildings to duck into that Nightcrawler may not be comfortable teleporting into suddenly. Nightcrawler by giving him lots of open space, surrounding vertical surfaces and shadows.

-Nightcrawler's abilities are as follows: Teleportation (the side effect of which is a puff of smoke and 'BAMF' sound along with the faint smell of brimstone), blending with shadows and a physical mutation allowing him to scale walls, giving him above peak-human agility and equipping him with a prehensile tail. He has training as a professional acrobat and as a fencer.

-Gambit's abilities are as follows: Kinetic manipulation of molecules which 'charges' inanimate objects with kinetic energy until they explode (explosion is relative to size of the object, 'charging' also takes more energy and time relative to size). Kinetic manipulation of molecules in the brain creating a scrambled signal when dealing with telepaths and involuntarily 'charming'/entrancing non-telepaths with eye-contact. Kinetic manipulation of his own body, allowing him near peak-human strength and speed. Gambit is a professional thief (which requires heightened awareness and acrobatics among other things - as seen in self-titled comics) and a practitioner of Savate."	t5_2s599	True

1371906038.0	1guqr6	Cybertron (Transformers) v.s. Imperium of Mankind (Warhammer 40k)	zedlx	23	7	22	"During the Dark Age of Technology, the artificial sentient humanoids, the [Men of Iron](http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Men_of_Iron#.UcWRQPlQEnI), rebelled against their human creators. This event marked the beginning of humanity's distrust of any machine intelligence.

The Transformers of Cybertron, once allies of ancient Terra, became unwilling enemies as the humans declared war on all artificial life. Rather than fighting the humans, they triggered an experimental device which warped them into the distant future. The 41st Millenium to be exact.

An Imperial Battlefleet was passing by when Cybertron warped back into realspace. Fearing a threat similar to that of the Iron Men or the Necrons, the Battlefleet signaled to all nearby Imperial planets before engaging Cybertron in a pre-emptive strike. The Transformers however, were aware of the approaching fleet and was ready to counter attack but not to fire the first shot.

**Cybertron**: assume peak of its civilization, before the civil war that divided the Autobots and the Decepticons. Assume every Transformer from canon sources is available except for reality warpers such as Primus, Unicron, and the Thirteen.

**Imperial Battlefleet**: assuming average number of vessels, using Battlefleets Cadia, Corona, and Scadia as examples: eight [Battleships](http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Battleships#.UcWXj_lQEnI), eleven [Cruiser](http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Cruiser#.UcWXz_lQEnI) squadrons, seventeen [Escort](http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Escort#.UcWX0PlQEnI) squadrons.

1369440510.0	1f04qm	A battle of creation: Steve (Minecraft) vs Maxwell (Scribblenauts)	vosqueej	19	3	24	"A battle for the ages! Two of gaming's most inventive protagonists, winner take all! In this corner: the man from the land where everything's fair and square- Steve from Minecraft! And his opponent: the child who, despite his hat, is definitely not chicken- Maxwell from Scribblenauts!


The Battle:

Both characters have access to their equipment: Steve has a crafting table and infinite resources to craft whatever he desires; Maxwell has his notebook, an endless pencil/pen, and his imagination. The battle will take place in a massive arena which has been divided in two by a barrier made of Bedrock, which will be removed once both competitors are prepared to fight. That is, neither competitor can see what the other is creating or disrupt it in any way.

To Make the Battle Fair:

Both fighters have one week to prepare. In this time, Steve may craft whatever he desires, be it armor, weapons, tools, a fort, a pig farm, a Redstone TNT cannon, potions, whatever. Steve cannot, however, use the 100% impenetrable Bedrock to build a fort. Maxwell can summon exactly ONE of any noun he wants out of his notebook; even with adjectives, only one may be summoned (eg. Summoning ""Cthulhu"" and ""Big Cthulhu"" violates the rule). Also, Maxwell cannot apply adjectives to himself, the environment, or anything of Steve's. For instance, he cannot make himself ""Invincible Maxwell"", have Steve's side of the arena be ""Uninhabitable"", or have Steve be ""Dead"" or ""Immobile"". He could, however, create ""Winged Armor"", or an ""Indestructable Sword"", or summon ""Giant Friendly Cthulhu"".*

Also, since Maxwell's inventory is much less limited than whatever Steve can create, we will maintain the hearts system used in Minecraft. That is, Steve has 10 hearts and whatever armor he wants, and Maxwell has 4 hearts and whatever armor he wants. I think this would help even this out.


How the battle is decided:

The battle is decided if one character manages to completely incapacitate the other. That is, the cannot attack or are dead.

    *Please note, if Maxwell's inventory is still to powerful (the inclusion of Death, God and Black Holes
    would give an unfair advantage, I'd imagine) then please limit what he can summon further. I would like this

*In other words... continue this story...*


**Batman** sits at his computer within the Batcave scanning the monitors for any activity with an annoyed scowl on his face.

Alfred steps in with a tray of food towards Bruce, ""Master Bruce, I believe you should eat something.""

""I'm not hungry Alfred.""

The esteemed butler sets the tray in front of of lifelong friend and responsibility, ""But I say you are and I insist you eat sir!"" he notices the slightly annoyed look on his young master's face and understands it is not the food that upsets him, ""You know as well as I do that the Justice League did not take you on the space mission only because you were preoccupied with other matters and simply could not wait. You understand, don't you?""

""I know Alfred! In my head and every scenario I think through I understand full well how important I am to the team. But every time something like this happens it just reminds me that no matter what I do I just feel as if they leave me out because I have no powers!""

Alfred taken aback by the short outburst but he understands. No matter how disciplined he is, no matter how many challenges he has overcome he understands that Bruce Wayne is still human. And with him sitting at the computer actively looking for a case to keep him occupied but finding none for over 12 hours straight.

But before Alfred can give some sage advice the alarm rings. Finally trouble arrives...

**The Accelerator** [http://myanimelist.net/character/13917/Accelerator] exits a wormhole and lands in Gotham city. Confused and unsure where he is he ask, albeit quite rudely, where he is to the nearest stranger, ""[Where am I?]"" in Japanese.

The stranger turns around and reveals he has clown makeup on and carrying an automatic weapon, ""*&amp;%^er can't you see were too busy to babysit some Jap tourist?""

""[English]"" Accelerator thinks as he notices that accompanying the joker gang member are others just like him and also armed to the teeth. He peers across them down the street and notices people with makeup on but with different patterns but a common theme, one side dark colors and the other with light colors, ""[Hmph! Completely useless bags of shit! I'm better off finding my own way.]""

The white haired teenager pushes aside the joker gang members with ease and walks down the street towards the Two-Face gang. The contempt on his face and the utter disrespect to the gang members enraged both sides.

""Muther-*&amp;%^er!"" screams on man and both sides immediately open fire on the lone boy and as quickly as the fight starts it abruptly ends as each bullet fired reflects perfectly off his personal 'vector' shield and hits every gang member on both sides. Luckly none of the shots are lethal.

Accelerator not even flinching at the sight uses his smart phone and and opens up Google maps. He locates the nearest police station and proceeds to 'fly there by manipulating the vectors around him.

Figuring that his bets bet to get back to Academy City is to contact the local authorities and demand transport back there. He opens the doors of the station and yells in his best English, ""Hoi! I am Accelerator! Send me back to Academy City! NOW!""

""Now hold on here son! You can't just barge in here and demand anything!"" an officer protest and tries to put his hands on Accelerator to calm him down but is forcefully repelled but the shield triggering the other officers in the station to...

""He's a power! Stop him!"" calls one and the others follow suit and readying their guns.

Accelerator sighs, ""Don't waste my time idiots."" and he slams his hand against the wall and smashes it through, ""I just want you to send me home.""

Rookie cop, first month on the job and first time seeing a being with powers and he has to run into a virtual monster-god in a child's body. It is in no way acceptable but completely understandable that he subconsciously squeezes the trigger... and it is unavoidable that his own bullet flew back right into his brain.

Like the gang war this escalates just as quickly despite the protest of the boy the officers open fire and the same happens but this time he isn't so lucky and there were more fatalities added to the first.

""You idiots! Do you not know who I am?"" screams the Accelerator. His power had just killed people... not clones created in a lab but actual people who have families to mourn them.

""Freeze! H..hands behind your head! N..n.. now!"" another officer aims a shotgun at him, ""I'm calling for backup so give up now!""

Not even hearing the policewoman he flees.

Accelerator shaking and looking at his hands imagining all the blood there is on them for killing actual innocents now his mind starts to crumble, ""Ahh... so I really am a monster. A killer... a murderer. Hahahha!"" but he debates against himself, ""No but they tried to shoot at me! I only asked for help! It's their fault"" but no sooner as he finishes that thought does he hear sirens all around him and soon he is surrounded by police cars.

He stands up and feels the wind currents around him interacting with his shield. He adjust his personal shield to block out all sound so he can think clearly and comes to the conclusion, ""If they want a fight! SO BE IT!""

Manipulating the wind currents around him at first creates a small tornado like effect. The police open fire but the attempts are useless as the reflecting effect is still active.

The winds are getting heavier now and converging into a small ball above Accelerator's head as sparks of plasma strike at the officers and their cars and it demonstrates how outclassed they are.

A few frantic phone calls later through the proper channels and the national guard is alerted and soon a small army is inbound for Gotham city. And this alerts Batman of the dire situation with little to no backup for the rest of the Justice League.

1364205325.0	1ays3u	Parasite vs Rogue- Bare-Handed Arm Wrestling	Roflmoo	16	1	10	"Full skin contact until someone is drained enough to lose the arm wrestle.

Assume that both are starting at a fairly similar state. Some versions of Rogue would be strong enough to win the fight before any power draining could happen, so if you use that version of her, then match her against a version of Parasite who's had enough of a power drain from Superman that they're on relatively equal footing to start off.

Points for exploring multiple versions of each character. "	t5_2s599	True
1364060905.0	1av9ll	April Tournament Update	Roflmoo	15	0	14	"Hey everyone, thanks for your patience with the Tournament. Fear not, it's still happening, it's just slowed for a while. I realize there's been very little progress the last few weeks, and that's my fault. Very sorry. I might try something a little different to speed things along, depending on your thoughts below. 

First thing is the [Improved Power Ratings Scale](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/19f1sw/improved_power_ratings_scale/). It's the big thing holding up the rest of the Tournament, so we need to finalize it as soon as possible. I will be working on it as I can, so please check it and comment from time to time if you're interested in having a say. 

Second huge thing is another one I have to apologize for- the [Tournament Test Match](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/18owxh/tournament_test_match_detailsrequest/) I promised you. Well, **both* matches really, as the voting ended in a tie. I haven't had time to get to it, but it is a big priority for me and a post will be happening soon so you can help decide on the conditions of the matches. (Location, special rules, etc.)

In order to help move things along a little, I would like to get a list of who wants to be part of the Tournament Staff, and maybe have a vague idea of the level of involvement you're after. I know a lot of you already, but as more and more people sign on, I'd hate to lose track and neglect anyone. If you want to volunteer, let me know, and I'll start a list somehow. If you want to be a public Staff Member, let me know in the comments and we can sort things out in that comment's cascade. If you want to stay out of the spotlight, feel free to private message me anytime. 

Again, everyone, I can't thank you enough for your continued interest and all the help, information, and encouragement you've provided. April should see a lot more progress than March, especially if we can get the new ratings done soon.

---

Ah, I forgot. Since all the comments so far are wondering what the Tournament Staff does, I should probably include the information up here.

Staff works with me on the Tournament. Jobs include fact checking, data collection, writing, critiquing rough draft fights, deciding on arena types, writing rules, and things of that nature. Really, the most common thing I'll do is ask for your advice. Whenever I get stuck on something, get some info wrong, or I run out of time to do something, I'll need to know the people willing to pick up the slack. I'll run a match by you once or twice, then write up a rough draft, let you look at it and suggest any changes, we can debate about the reasoning behind any conflicting decisions, and then I'll finalize it and ""publish"" the fight. 

For example, the Test Matches will be written soon. I will need a few people to brainstorm and come up with elements the fight must include. Chances are, a lot of you guys will know more about various characters than I do, so your knowledge and input trumps any research I can do. This is essential to getting these fights right, and a diversity of thought processes will lead to less predictable, less biased, and more entertaining fights.

Once the Tournament actually starts, fights will be a little more secret before they come out. The staff members who have been the most influential (and who I can trust not to leak the fight details) will be on my short list of people to consult. I already know of three or four other people who have contributed massively to the Tournament, and at least a few more who have excellent analytic ability, that I am certain will play large roles later on.

All of this is purely for as long as you are having fun with it. If you don't want a task I offer you, don't take it. If you accept a task and won't finish it, no worries, we can work around it. Nothing will ever be strict, and I am no one's boss. I'm organizing everything, but I am not in charge. I want this to be a community effort and I want people to be involved because they enjoy it. 

I guess the best way to say it is that the Tournament Staff will consist of those among us who are as dedicated to this project and it's success as I am. Those willing to spend a lot of free time working on this because they truly enjoy it. If at any time it starts to feel like a chore, (or if real life happens) let me know and you can have as much of a break as you want for however long you want. Just know that the longer it is, the less input you'll have. 

If you want to be anonymous overall, private message me (from a throwaway if you like) and we'll work something out that fits you.

Okay, I think that's enough information for now. Questions? Comments? Compliments? Hate mail? You know what to do.

This is a fight to the death/deactivation. The arena is a stereotypical ""Santa's Village"" at the North Pole with elf houses, a toy workshop, and Santa's house. The village is totally abandoned.

The child is eight-years-old, human male, and has locked himself in his room. The Doctor and Clark Kent each get 30 minutes to speak with the child through the door and try to comfort them, calm them, and try to persuade them into opening the door on their own and coming out.

They are only given a very brief prep time on the way to the child which simply gives them some basic facts: His name, age, who his family is, and that the child is scared of something but won't say what.

After whoever goes first, the child's memory is wiped of that encounter before the other competitor's attempt. This is to prevent one from saying that he's ""nicer than the other"" or having an already-calmed child to speak with.

The Doctor is allowed to use his sonic screwdriver for anything other than opening the door. Clark Kent is allowed to use any power, but he cannot reveal his secret identity nor put on his costume and arrive as Superman.

The colossi have only one weakness a sigil that is hidden on their bodies, Sauron does not know of these weaknesses at first but they can be discovered. Also Sauron does not have the ring so he is in his severely weakened state, he will rely on his armies to defend his fortress. But will they be enough? Or will they flee at the sight of this army of giants which some, dwarf even a balrog which may have been equal to Sauron himself.

EDIT, Bonus scenario: Dormin has been released, The one ring has been found and is returned to Sauron, but his armies have been all but destroyed by the colossi. can Sauron figure out how to defeat him or will the sudden appearance of the colossi and siege and near destruction of Mordor be too much for Sauron to handle. 

For clarification Sauron is a [Maiar](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Maiar) a powerful entity but weaker than those who came before him the Valar. 
Dormin is more of a mystery, he was imprisoned for committing an unforgivable act. The full extent of his power is unknown, but to imprison him the 16 colossi were created and an ancient civilization abandoned their lands to the colossi that held Dormin. So from speculation lets say Dormin is comparable to The Valar. 

Although greater than Sauron he was powerful enough to oppose a Valar, so in other words once the armies exhausted themselves how would a battle between these entities playout?
