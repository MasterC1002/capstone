1371220620.0	1gc8mj	How to return your Galaxy S3 to it's factory state (unroot, revert to stock rom and stock recovery, reset binary counter).	doovd	101	15	23	"Hi I posted a thread on XDA with this information. I did this because there was no other definitive complete guide on the internet as to how to bring back your phone to it's original state.

==========================================
What this will leave you with in the end
==========================================
1. Official Firmware
2. Official Recovery
3. Binary Counter set to 0
4. Device status to ""Normal""
5. Factory Settings as if you just took it out of the box.

Basically once you do this it will be good enough if you need to return for warranty purposes.

Tutorial here: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2323847

Thanks for reading, hope it is of help to you!

Please Note: I am no expert of android modding or anything like that, I'm just an enthusiast who got an S3, decided to root it and flash with ClockWorkMod because I wanted to be cool with a rooted phone and then got a heart attack and learnt I voided my warranty. I couldn't find any definitive sources online that I could follow so I had to put together lots of bits from lots of guides and this worked for me :) You can ask me if you have any questions but unfortunately I may not be able to answer it."	t5_2u1ok	True

 * First, take a look at this pic I shot with [standard shooting mode](http://imgur.com/sCSdS).
 * Next, take a look at one with [HDR shooting mode](http://imgur.com/yZsAf).

I'm holding the phone roughly in the same position, and each photo is within moments of the last. The difference is that the dark areas in the HDR version are much brighter, and the bright areas are less washed out. A far better photo, and definitely closer to what you'd see with your eyes.

So why isn't that feature always on? First, you don't get continuous shooting -- the camera must work for a couple of seconds after each picture you shoot.

Also, you have to hold the camera much more steady. What happens is that the phone takes multiple pictures at varying exposures and *combines* the best part of each picture into one still frame. That way nothing is too washed out, and nothing is too dark. Pretty neat, huh?

---

**Prerequisites**

* This is only for the Sprint Galaxy S3.
* You *must* be running 100% stock unrooted.
* You need a 32g or smaller SD card. That's because Android Recovery doesn't recognize SDXC cards, even though the Galaxy S3, once booted, does.

**Instructions**

* Download the update [directly from Google's servers](http://android.clients.google.com/packages/ota/sprint_samsung_l710/eec955eb4a5b.update_SPH-L710_LI3_to_LJ7.zip) and put it in the root directory of your SD card.
* Turn the phone off.
* Boot into **stock** recovery by holding down the volume up and home buttons as you turn the phone on.
* Choose to apply an update from external storage, then choose the zip file.
* Wait for it to do its magic.

**That's all there is to it!**

Enjoy, Sprint GS3 users!

To back up your data, you can use the carbon app from google play.  
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koushikdutta.backup&amp;hl=de



If you are not flashing any custom roms, there is also no need to wipe data or cache, so you should be fine without a back-up.. but better early than late.

USB Debugging (developer tools) must be turned on.



First, read this post from /r/Android:  
[Why should I root my phone?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/distm/allwhy_should_i_root_here_is_why/)

The post includes a rough explanation of what rooting means, too.

Now for the interesting part:

How to get root access?

**The easiest way for the S3 I9300 (international Version) and the S3 I9305 (international Version LTE) is to use framaroot.**

You can find the guide here:  
http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2130276

To sum it up, you just have to install the apk and run it.

This installs SuperUser and the su binary. That's it, you are rooted!

Another way is using the chainfire root method.

http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1695238
 
You'll need [odin](http://forum.xda-developers.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=1110471&amp;d=1338981159) and the [rootkernel](http://download.chainfire.eu/196/CF-Root/SGS3/CF-Root-SGS3-v6.4.zip)(download button at the very bottom of the page).

Now, make sure your phone is charged. Kill all Kies processes in the taskmanager.

Copy pasta from the xda thread:

* Unzip the attached Odin3-vX.X.zip file
* Download and unzip the CF-Root-SGS3-vX.X.zip file (see posts below this one)
* If you end up with a recovery.img and cache.img file, you've extracted twice. You need to end up with a .tar file - don't extract that one
* (USB) Disconnect your phone from your computer
* Start Odin3-vX.X.exe
* Click the PDA button, and select CF-Root-SGS3-vX.X.tar
* Put your phone in download mode (turn off phone, then hold volume-down + home + power to boot - if it asks you to press a button to continue, press the listed button, or run adb reboot download command)
* (USB) Connect the phone to your computer
* Make sure Repartition is NOT checked
* Click the Start button
* Wait for Android to boot
* Done!

**Of course, this isn't working for the T999, SGH-i747, SCH I535 and so on.**

Now, what to do with this phones? 

**T999**

basically: [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=QPeIZZVYHbY)

Download [this](http://downloadandroidrom.com/file/GalaxyS3Sprint/rooting/GalaxyS3RootSprint.zip)

Now, make sure your phone is charged. Kill all Kies processes in the taskmanager.

Then do this (just like the chainfire method):

* Open Odin3-vX.X.zip file
* If you end up with a recovery.img and cache.img file, you've extracted twice. You need to end up with a .tar file - don't extract that one
* (USB) Disconnect your phone from your computer
* Start Odin3-vX.X.exe
* Click the PDA button, and select clockworkmod.TAR
* Put your phone in download mode (turn off phone, then hold volume-down + home + power to boot - if it asks you to press a button to continue, press the listed button, or run adb reboot download command)
* (USB) Connect the phone to your computer
* Make sure Repartition is NOT checked
* Click the Start button
* Wait for Android to boot
* Done! We just flashed the cwm recovery (clockworkmod recovery)
* Place the CWM-SuperSU-v0.87.zip in your phone's sdcard (for example the download folder)
* now put your phone in recovery mode (turn off phone, then hold volume-up + home + power to boot).
* select install zip from sdcard
* select the folder in which you placed cwm-supersu-v0.87.zip
* select yes
* done!

your t999 is now rooted.

Guides for other versions will follow in the future.

I'm in the process of trying to get my money back, but also figuring out my options from here if that fails.

This however is really really great. Before I bought it I got the apk off a file sharing website. Not going to spend $8 on a potential piece of crap. Did not regret and would donate to the developer to improve it.

Here is a nice review which gives a list of supported games and some tips: http://www.ifans.com/forums/threads/new-ds-emulator-drastic-ds-emulator.399418/

Been on Pokemon Black all morning and it doesn't fail to deliver at any point. There are no FPS issues, the UI is nice (could be refined), there are different display options, key mapping available, the sound doesn't drop ANY fps at all, not that it would affect it.

Nothing more to say. Get it.

I'm running the latest version of Google Maps on the play store and my phone is running Android 4.1.2.

The phone initially would give turn-by-turn directions using street names with ""navigate"" in a female voice.

I've tried uninstalling the updates for Maps so it was back to what was initially on the phone and that worked once.

All 3 have experienced the same problem with the exterior rubber case.  The case begins to stretch over time and no longer fits tightly to the plastic shell.  I believe it has something to do with the quality of the material, since I have other otterbox defender cases for older phones that this does not happen too.  I also have a habit of having to pull my battery a lot since I like to develop on my phone and I'm prone to crashes/lockups.  However, the rubber on my wife's phone has stretched over time to not fit as tightly and she rarely pulls it off.

I found a guy on youtube suggesting you boil the rubber exterior and drop it in cold water.  I was skeptical at first, but since I had an extra case I thought I would give it a try.  I'm happy to report it worked.

Here's the video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynVG4xUFgcE

I boiled one silicone case for 30 seconds and dropped it in for 10 seconds.  This was only slightly stretched.

I boiled a second silicone case for about a minute and dropped it in for 10 seconds.  This case was one of mine and had stretched quite a bit by the time I was done with it.

Both either shrank enough to get a tight fit or to get near a tight fit.

So about 30 mins ago I dropped my S3 while trying to grab it from my pocket. Somehow it slipped and dropped screen flat on to the tile floor in my kitchen.

It works but the colors are very faded. I'm wondering what my options are at this point. 

Any help? 

EDIT: I should add that there is no physical damage to the phone itself in terms of cracks or anything of that sort. The screen just has retro looking colours and is very faded. It charges, notifications work and I can make calls/texts with it :( 

EDIT 2: Called up Samsung and the phone is still under warranty. They sent me a shipping label and I'll be sending the phone to them for inspection. Since there is no damage to the outside, they may be able to fix it. If however they find extensive internal damage, they will charge me. Thank you for all the comments and suggestions.

First post here. Right off the bat, I do not own an S3 but I'm posting on here because I'm curious on a friend's behalf.

So at the end of last year one of my best friends picked up a Galaxy S3 after coming from an iPhone 4S and loved it, but he was really skeptical about rooting it. He had asked me several questions about rooting and such since I've worked on computers, phones, and game consoles for years so I've been a bit familiar with roots and jailbreaks.

Anyways I'd say 2 months ago he finally wanted to root his phone and had me over so I could make sure he didn't slip up on anything. We did all the correct procedures to root the phone, had ClockworkMod running on it as a Recovery, and then flashed over LiquidSmooth 2.3 so he could have a custom ROM. Flashed over the ROM, wiped Cache, wiped Dalvik, and then rebooted. However each time it was locked on the LiquidSmooth boot screen, we noticed however that it wouldn't work 100% until we wiped Data but since then it was fine. After that we flashed GAPPS and it was good to go.

Well this weekend he came by and while at my house wanted to update to the latest version of LiquidSmooth. He looked it up on the same spot he got the original ROM from, downloaded LiquidSmooth 2.9, downloaded GAPPS, loaded them onto the SD card and then booted into Recovery. I mentioned the Data issue to him before and he said ""Well I'll try flashing the ROM alone first, if it locks up again like last time I'll wipe Data.""

So we went into Recovery, flashed the ROM, wiped Cache, Dalvik, and then rebooted. But it suddenly went black and.... That was it. From there we tried out every button combo and it was just a black screen, the closest we got was some miscellaneous plugin that couldn't install when plugged in. I don't remember the name, but when we looked it up it just referred us to the fact that it was a Hard Brick and we couldn't fix it unless we JTAG'd the phone... Which I don't have the hardware for unfortunately.

So my question is: How could this happen? Yes I understand there's ALWAYS a risk in bricking, but I remember when I flashed an incorrect phone's ROM to my Galaxy S 4G it just locked up on the boot screen and was soft bricked, so I was able to fix it up through Recovery. The only way I can really think of hard bricking a phone is to pull the battery while flashing a ROM... If everything was done correctly what do you all think could be the issue?

For the record, this is also the Verizon version of the phone."	t5_2u1ok	True

Here is how they solved it: Clean your usb on the phone with a toothpick (or what ever comes in handy. I don't suggest metal, though). There was a lot of dust in there which blocked some of the pins so the phone recognized the PC only as a charger. Now it works again.  
**TL;DR: Clean your USB on your phone with a toothpick.**

TinhornNinja	18	2	33	"i recently switched from an iphone 4 to a galaxy s3 and i'm really liking it, except that every know and then some background process that i cant find will start driving my battery into the ground.

here is a screenshot of my battery life over 18 hours
http://i.imgur.com/EfIhgFE.png
its pretty clear that something had started using my cpu like crazy a few hours before i took this screenshot. and this happens on a regular basis. i have a few other screenshots that im too lazy to upload but you catch my drift. its annoying because i'll not use my phone for a while and then take it out of my pocket and it will be hot and the battery will be 40% lower than when i put it in my pocket two hours ago. and after this happens and i look at my power distribution it usually says screen at about 30%, android os at about 30%, android system at about 20% and cell standby at about 20%, any excess is usually used by device idle and everything else. 

TL;DR something is hijacking my CPU and driving my battery into the ground, is there an app or task manager that will help me manage my battery life?"	t5_2u1ok	True

I RMA'd it, but I was impatient so I ordered another one immediately, figuring I could give the first replacement to my gf for her phone. The replacement card never worked from the time it arrived. No big deal since I had already ordered another from Amazon. I've been using that one for about 2 months now, and a few weeks ago I started having problems. It would say that the card had been removed, then it wouldn't detect it. Then it magically started working again. It's been working fine these past 3 weeks or so but suddenly, yesterday, it started happening again and now I can't read any data from the card, either on my phone or my computer. Is it possible that it's the phone frying the SD cards and not just shitty manufacturing on the cards? It just seems unlikely that I'd have so many cards die so quickly...

Side note: Both times the card started acting up (first a few weeks ago then again yesterday) I had just put new files on it. I only mention it because of how it messed up the first time, then it was totally fine until I loaded it up with new files again. 

Basically I'm wondering if I should just RMA the card again or should I be looking in to getting the phone replaced?"	t5_2u1ok	True

It wasn't until I went outside today in the sunlight that I realized there is a single spec of dust on the screen beneath the glass.

1353032005.0	139xr5	So, I finally rooted my phone and installed CM10...	Unwright	18	3	49	"Honestly, the results have surprised me quite a bit. I thought everyone was blowing smoke about how good CM10 is, but now that a Stable build for all of the non-international S3s came out, I decided to go for broke. Rooted it, backed up the essentials with Titanium, flashed Clockwork Mod Recovery, backed up my Stock build and then flashed CM10. 

I had some problems along the way, only because I didn't wipe System cache and the phone was incredibly confused, but after I resolved that all was well. 

Now, here are some kickers, good and bad. Bad? No S3-specific awesomeness. Movement-based things are all gone. No more panning, no more pick-up-phone-on-text-to-call-back, and that's pretty much it for the cons. Due to my own oversight, I didn't back up my apps (specifically for restore, but I still have all of them if I need to go back to stock) which meant I had to download and reinstall all my apps. The Play Store couldn't download and install apps remotely for a little bit, but after a few phone restarts, that resolved itself as well.

As for the pros, however, oh my god. I'm getting roughly 1.5x the battery life. I don't know if I got lucky with timing or if a better radio was flashed, but my connection speed increased by around 10 megabits, which was nice. The most important thing, though, was the absolute speed of the thing. Before, whenever I opened an app (Google Voice) for example, there was some really obvious lag and it took forever and the whole situation felt sluggish. Now, I tap the icon and it opens in under a half second. Same with Chrome and Gallery and everything. The thing just BLAZES now. 

Obviously, the extra nice thing is being able to strip away the bloatware. No background BS, no wasted space, no contant updating. It's a real thing of beauty.

Last night I plugged in my S3 (AT&amp;T model running Jelly Bean) to charge, and unplugged it when I got up today. Throughout today, I hardly used it at all. But less than 8 hours later, I hear the low battery beep...turns out it went from 100% to 10% in less than 8 hours.

I cannot figure out what could have caused the battery to drain so ridiculously fast. According to BetterBatteryStats, it was awake for 17 minutes and screen on for 8 minutes (more or less what the settings screencap shows). It seems doubtful that any process/service would have been able to suck 90% of the battery in that short of a time. Bluetooth/wi-fi are off and i've been home almost all day where I get decent 4G/LTE signal, so it's probably not been searching for a signal constantly.

I've had the S3 for about a month or so and haven't been all that happy with the battery life compared to my old iPhone 4...it's usually lasted 1-3 days with light use, and i've been trying to figure out the cause of it. That's a whole other topic though (it's seemed like a lot of it is attributable to ""1013"" process, which is supposedly the media server?) But I have never had anything happen like this.

I rooted my phone yesterday so I could install titanium backup and adfree yadda yadda. I had also been thinking of installing the stock version of messaging and get rid of the touch wiz version. Went through the procedure and completed it. I removed go sms and anything else text related while I was at it. 

Now it feels like my phone is much faster, at least when going to the home screen especially from the messaging app. The screen almost never redraws.

Anyway, my questions:

1. I'm interested in being able to get rid of preinstalled apps and having (almost) complete control over my phone (ie. rooting it) but I'm a little hesitant since it could void my warranty/could brick my phone, etc. I technically have a 14 day grace period to decide if I really want to keep the phone or not, but I feel like it's not a good idea to hand them back a rooted or bricked phone. So how safe is rooting (provided that I'm not a dumbass and follow directions)

2. What are some ""must-have"" apps or things I should have install? I like having things clean and simple and also not have my phone being connected to something all the time whether it be wifi or cellular data.

3. What are some decent protective cases? I'm not looking for something that makes my phone look like a brick, but would like some protection

4. Batteries. So far, I've gotten about a little over 24 hours with medium usage (little cellular data/wifi usage here and there, but otherwise turned off and some camera usage), but I'm wondering what are some solid options as to extending battery life.

Lastly, it seems like right now the 2nd usage cycle, the battery's capabilities remarkably diminished. I've had the phone screen off and basically it's been idle and it's dropped 4% in 21 min. This is worse than the stock battery. I'm really confused and I don't know exactly what went wrong here.

Hi guys,

Been lurking here for a while now and thought I'd share my experiences with this particular ROM. I've been using Android for a few years now and am an avid follower. I always try to keep my devices up to date with the latest ROMs (I have a Xoom and an i747 S3). I've rooted and installed ROMs on my friends' phones as well. 

I was using stock TW for a while running the K747 Kernel, ADW launcher, and some tweaks here and there. TW definitely leaves a lot to be desired and can get frustrating after awhile. After installing a few different ROMs I settled on the AOKP Task650 ROM (w/ provided underwear Kernel). The latest release has provided an extremely smooth and reliable Android experience. Everything runs quickly and without issue. The best part is, my battery life has been AMAZING. On TW I could get anywhere between 18-30 hours on a single charge depending on how much I use it. The only catch was I could only get a couple hours of screen time, maybe close to 3 hours if I started using the phone a lot on a full charge. With Task650's AOKP ROM, I have been getting 24-36 (or even more, haven't experimented) hours on Battery with 3-4 (or more) hours of screen time! Right now I'm 21 hours in with 3 hours of screen time clocked and I still have 35% battery remaining! This ROM is a beast and I highly recommend it to anyone with an AT&amp;T S3 who wants the most out of their device."	t5_2u1ok	True

The thingie is so tight around the phone that the volume goes crazy while it's inside. 

Since I can't seem to disable the sound controls, I have to ask:

1)  How do you exercise/carry around the damn and listen to music on it without the volume controls screwing up?  Is there an app or something I'm missing?  I tried volume control + and no success.  

2)  Why in the hell wasn't there a disable option, seeing as how this is a VERY foreseeable problem, even from my technologically-challenged point of view?

First of all, the battery seems the be draining at a percent every 5-10 minutes of being completely idle. Secondly, it's been getting noticeably warm in my pocket. I'm not sure what the internal temperature is, but I can pretty much feel a warm patch on my pants at all times.



I really doubt that this battery life is normal. It's practically unusable. I have all the unnecessary features turned off: GPS, Blue tooth, Multiwindow. The brightness has either been on Auto or at its minimum. It was fully charged at around 3:00 pm, and since then, I've only used it check email, facebook and play a few songs, take a few pictures, and play two games of 7x7. That's it, but it was enough to take the battery down to 10% Other than that, I'm really impressed by the phone. I guess I was wondering if this was worth taking back to get replaced, or if there is something I should do to improve it.


It's actually gone down 5% since since starting this post a few minutes ago.

i decided to go ahead and get it and couldnt be happier.     
i picked up the kit (case and charging stand) and an additional charging stand. i keep one on my desk and one in my home so essentially whenever i leave either of those 2 places i am always at 100% charge.      
* the convenience of not having to plug/unplug a cable is awesome (i know, first world problems).      
* despite what the website says, there is additional weight. it is noticeable - but not crazy, and honestly it makes the phone feel a bit more 'solid'      
* the replacement back cover is slightly thicker than the oem one. were talking maybe a mm or 2 tops. i dont use a case so i can't say whether or not it would interfere with that   
* the back cover is a shade or 2 darker than the stock phone (more of a cobalt blue vice the silvery blue     
* the magnet is very strong and the connection to the stand feels perfectly secure without being too hard to remove as you get up from your desk       
* i haven't tried nfc so i cant say if that works or not

Since I wanted to keep my phone in warranty, I called up Samsung and got quoted the standard ~$178 price to replace the screen. I ended up living with it, and just got a good case and screen protector instead. Today I finally decided that I had enough, and figured I'd go ahead and  get it repaired, but instead of $178, the Samsung tech gave me a quote of ~$135 to fix it. I don't think I'd ever heard that they lowered the price, but I figured there might be some out there who might find it a little more palatable to save about $40 on the repair.

1357262119.0	15x7ry	A short comparison of Touchwiz Vs. Cyanogenmod	coolpersob	20	10	26	"I'd like to start off by apologizing for the crazed, fanboy post I made a few weeks ago here praising CM10 as a gift from god. I was so obsessed with it back then, when I first downloaded it. Now, after switching back to touchwiz for a week, then back to CM10, and now CM10.1(nightly), I think I am able to make a nice little post explaining some pros and cons.


**Touchwiz:** The stock OS that comes with the phone. 

* Pros: Very well integrated into abilities of the phone. Inspired by nature, and there is a lot to learn in the gestures that you have the option to choose. Perfect for the new user, which was me at one point. I like the homescreen and locker. The pop-up message and call icons are great, and on the homescreen, the time and weather widget is very eye-appealing. The camera is great! If you can't live without all the fancy features on the camera, switching away from this ROM might be a deal breaker for you.

* Cons: Lag. Bloat. Stuff you don't need, and will never use. The swipe between pages on the homescreen is ugly to me. I did correct this with a new launcher, but it just doesn't feel right. One of the big things for me is the customization. I mean, its android, so you can do a lot with it, but I feel like Touchwiz is treating me like a baby. Everytime I set a new default action, it tells me where I can reset the default actions. I can't use developer options. I just feel like Touchwiz is my mother, telling me I can do anything, while hiding half of the stuff I don't know about.


**CM10:**

* Pros: HOLY GOOGLE, BATMAN. This is the good shit. Very lightweight, un-bloated ROM. First thing I noticed upon installation was the speedy experience. So, damn fast. I feel like this is what Google meant for Android to be. I love the blue overall theme of it. Everything is uniform, and customizable beyond belief. You just have to search for what you want. I feel like I'm missing so much, because I could go on for days about the endless possiblities of CM10. No matter what anyone says, it is worth trying for atleast a week. If you don't atleast like it, I'll send you a 5 paragraph essay with my apologies.

* Cons: The camera is pretty simple. Panorama is your only ""extra"" feature, since you don't get HDR. And, you have to watch out what CM10 you're using. I was using the CM10 stable, but I had one bug that made the home button unresponsive about half the time when trying to wake the screen. Then, I switched to a nightly, and hallelujah. Also, people complain about data drops. I haven't noticed them very often, they don't really bug me.

**BONUS: CM10.1:**

* Pros: Camera upgrades, better notification system with the quick access to settings, and new lockscreen with more widgets. Oooh, and the new Chronus widget is damn beautiful. Best clock widget I've seen.

* Cons: You need to see which nightly works for you. The latest nightly I tried was very buggy. Tried the nightly from a few days before, and its perfect. No app force closes, just make sure you flash the new gapps. 

So, conclusion? Try out CM10. I am going to be staying with CM10 for awhile. It has a few small issues, but I love finding solutions and being on the breaking edge of Android."	t5_2u1ok	True

BearBus	20	9	43	"I recently bought the GS3, and I love the camera but not so much the camera app.  My biggest concern is that you have to hit the tiny shutter button all the way at the bottom of the screen to take a picture in portrait.

I had Camera ZOOM FX on my old phone (MyTouch4G), and the feature I liked most was the ability to touch anywhere on the screen to snap a picture, rather than only a shutter button in one small defined space.


Can I adjust the stock app settings, should I reactivate ZOOM FX, or is there a better, third option?

1350874760.0	11vkpm	Best method to move apps to external SD.	dre10g	11	0	5	"I found this on another forum and tested it. Works like a charm!

If you are root you can use links2sd. Plug your SD card directly into your computer, backup the contents to your computer (you will be formatting it so you want to save your data). Using a partition tool (i used Minipartition Tool Home Edition because its free and very simple any tool will do though) you want to format your sd card to fat32. 

I then take half of my 16gb card and format it to ext4. The fat32 portion i use for music/movies/pictures. Make the fat32 portion primary that way your phone will recognize the sdcard. (at first make the ext4 primary that way it shows the partition as active and then make the fat32 the primary so they're both active).

Put all your backed up storage back on the fat32 portion of the sdcard (this will all that will be visible to windows). Put the sdcard back in your phone. Your phone OS will only recognize the fat32 portion of the sdcard at first, this is normal. Download ""links2sd"" from the playstore. When you open the app it will ask what to link to select where you would like the files to be linked to select ""ext4"". It will say mount script created. Restart the phone, then select one of your applications and link it.

 If you have formatted everything correctly it will link the application to your sdcard ext4. Then you can select all and under actions select link to sd. It will then move all the information done to ext4 of your sd card. 

You can also click menu, settings, and have the program automatically link any new apps downloaded automatically. Now all of your app information is on the sdcard ext4. A small portion of the app remains on the internal storage as some apps will crash if the entire app is moved to the sdcard so links2sd is a much better way to free up space and still have your phone run fast and smooth (ext4 is the fastest of any partition). 

In links2sd you can menu --&gt; storage info and you will now see extsdcard AND SD Card 2nd Part (this is your app storage). the extsdcard is your fat32 which is where I store all my music/video/movies etc.This keeps your internal sdcard with tons of space. "	t5_2u1ok	True

**Problem:**
It seems that when connecting my phone it recognizes that it is connected to the [computer.](http://i.imgur.com/VF3nB.png) However the computer doesn't recognize my [phone.](http://i.imgur.com/pcPz7.png)

I get no result when using [Samsung Kies](http://i.imgur.com/8STGf.png) either. It recognizes that the phone is connected, however, it fails to go any further to read the memory.

**My Conclusion:** The Samsung Galaxy S3 drivers fail to launch after connecting the phone via USB.

**Solution:**

I found that if you open the USB PC connection settings in the phone and check the box [Camera (PTP)](http://i.imgur.com/GivxE.png) my [computer](http://i.imgur.com/iebyS.png) will read the memory.

This policy is in place for privacy reasons so that using the native camera creates a sound that would be noticeable to any subjects of a photograph, willing or unwilling. This policy is another example of Sprint™s ongoing commitment to privacy when it comes to mobile device usage. This specification does not have any bearing on 3rd party camera applications that a user may download and use outside of the native device camera.""

I actually got the Galaxy S3 today and finished rooting and unlocking the bootloader - as of this moment finished installing CleanROM (I don't mind TW but the useless VZW bloatware had to go).

I've also noticed that the battery life goes down really quickly when I'm in my university residence (10%/hour even when idle).

When I text and charge on my laptop (which I know I shouldn't do), it doesn't charge at all.

* the charging LED is now not as bright as before

* the notification bar is now in a grey color rather than dark

* the volume buttons now can't set the ""no sound"" setting anymore when you level down. the last setting is vibrate

(bugs)

* apparently, there seems to be an error in the stock email app which causes to render text and background in the same color in energy save mode

* overall sluggishness, rather more lags in app launching/switching instead of the promised ""project butter"" smoothness

* touchwiz launcher crashes sometimes when editing your widget screens

* LED notification is reportedly going crazy at times. blinking or steady lights showing without any reason for a notification

I tried CSRom for a few days, which I really liked actually (I missed the TW camera and calendar apps) but there were a few bugs that I hated and the customization was just lacking overall (except for some staggeringly terrific battery life).

A few days ago I flashed Carbon which has been ok, but honestly it seems just like CM10.1 (which, yes, it's based off of) but I honestly don't see any differences, either in functionality, or in the abysmal battery life. Would a different kernel fix this??? (stock carbon kernel)

So my question is, when it comes to the AOSP roms, what's the difference between them? Slimbean and Carbon and LiquidSmooth and CM10.1 all look (and operate) pretty much the same way... I feel like I'm missing something.

I'm on an AOSP/CM based rom at the moment and when I open the camera it throws an error that reads ""Cannot connect to camera"" and closes, if I'm on a stock/TW based rom the error reads ""camera failed"" and closes.

After doing a lot of searching I read that this error has to do with the camera firmware and I stumbled on this thread on the T-MO SGS3 forum on  XDA - http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2102981

    -So basically they're saying to paste these .bin files in /data/ 
    and set permissions to 777... this had no effect.

This then lead me to this thread on the international SGS3 XDA forum - http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2113526&amp;page=4

    These guys say to revert to stock (or a stock based rom), open 
    your phone app and type *#34971539# to access the 
    CameraFirmware Update window. Great.  Well, when I run this, the
    screen turns black and the title reads  ""CameraFirmware Update"", 
    but then it exits and I get a pop up ""Factory Test has closed"".. 

    Prior to this point I have ODIN'd back to stock rooted FW and nothing. 
    I figured it may have been a bad firmware download, so I try stock 
    again from another source..same FC.. I try stock rooted.. same FC.. 
    I flash a TW rom, same thing.. 

None of the stock roms will load that damn CameraFirmware screen and this isn't built into CM/AOSP roms. After reading thru the international thread, I found that lots of people have this issue. I did some more searching and can't find anything.. I found more USSD codes, but none get me to the CameraFirmware window.

So now I'm completely stumped..I found a way to update the firmware, but my phone won't open screen and the other way has no effect.. Has anyone else came across this issue? How did you fix it?

Anyway, about two weeks ago I noticed that when I plugged my phone into an auxiliary cable in my car that only one side of the cars speakers were playing the music, I thought it to be pretty weird, picked up my phone to change the song and when the jack moved the audio could be heard fully. 


Now when I have my earbuds in, if I bump my phone or touch the jack where the 'phones are coming out of, the audio becomes distorted, only comes out of one ear, alternating depending on if you turn it in the socket, to going completely silent and not in able to hear it at all... 


I've tried using other headphones, all of them experience similiar effects to differing degrees of extremes. The worst being the Samsung earbuds that came with the phone itself. 


I was wondering if there's a quick fix, or a fix that won't take very long. Even though I can get a new phone no problem because of the contract, it's still a giant pain in the ass moving all of my purchased apps, music, contacts, games, movies etc to a new phone.

* How is the build quality? Is the home button likely to start to fail after a year or so like my iPhone 4?

* How future proof is it? I know the S4 is coming out this year, but I don't really want an even bigger screen. I would like it to last at least 2 years and not be insanely obsolete. Surely there will be a point when you don't need any more cores and RAM in a mobile phone?

Anyways I thought what am I losing by flashing to the Telus Firmware that is posted on XDA (root injected), and just applying the Bell APN settings.

So I did just that, I downloaded the latest Jellybean root injected stock firmware for Telus off XDA, flashed the phone with Odin, and since then I can say my phone is lasting longer.

I was getting poor battery life so one of the fixes I heard helped was to factory reset and reinstall all apps from the play store.  I manually backed up my contacts/photos/texts through USB and did the reset.  Once the phone was reset and set back up, I went to transfer my backup files back to the phone and the USB cable is no longer recognized to connect the phone to the computer (no USB logo on phone and no phone in 'my computer' or installing drivers bubble).  The USB cable I was using was 3rd party, but keep in mind IT WORKED 10 MINUTES AGO! So I try another computer and the OEM usb cable.  Still doesn't work.

Debug USB on/off doesn't work.
Erase drivers, reinstall drivers doesn't work.
Uninstall KIES, reinstall KIES doesn't work.
Run through 'connectivity' troubleshoot on KIES, still won't work.

Finally I get to work this morning and connect to my work PC with another 3rd party (monoprice) USB cable, and it connects just fine as if there was no problem.

So somehow the factory reset has made my S3 extremely picky as to what cables it will allow to transfer data.  I haven't tried using the monoprice cable at home yet but I will do that later today.

There seems to be many ways to Flash the phone Odin, CWM, Adb, mobile odin. There also seems to be a few ways to root the phone as well.



First off to clarify....""flashing"" is essentially like installing right? I would think that you require to flash roms, updates, software kernels etc.



What about rooting? i thought rooting was something else (like entering a passcode to get admin access, or hacking something) until i came across  Root with no flash counter


http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1739426


It seems like they are flashing to root. Is flashing to root or injecting the root the normal rooting procedure? 
If this is considered as normal, then rooting, is essentially like installing a rom(via flashing) with more admin access.....


It seems to me that CWM has multi uses, from flashing to restoring or creating backups.


Is Odin, ADB, and mobile odin the same? Or are those specifically for flashing ROMs? 


Is the no counter trip rooting method good for my Canadian S3 on Rogers I747 model? 


I've also noticed the flash tripping method combined with Triangle away to reset flash count. 


Then theres this Rogers ROOT page (http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1822308). 


and this INTRODUCING THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 TOOLKIT [SNAPDRAGON EDITION] 

http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1746665


how does these differ with each other?

- S3 toolkit

- Rogers method

- root with no counter trip

- root with counter trip

- any other root methods?

I swapped my iPhone 4 for a GS3 last week. I'd first like to take the opportunity to give you guys some feedback from the position of someone who was previously on iOS.


First of all, I must say that I tend to flee from the debate between both systems. Long story short, I was going to buy the iPhone 5 until I got news that the new aluminum casing was getting scratched easily and Apple didn't give a fuck about it. Apparently, the phone can even be scratched before unboxing... Both phone were previously mostly equal in my mind but I at least expected to get quality... So I decided to get the S3. The simplicity of Apple products is getting me nostalgic here... I try not to change my mind but I seem pretty much unlucky so far...


Now I got a beast in my hand and I down know how to handle it. I jumped like a lion by trying to put Jelly Bean on it straight afterward and I think I missed some notions about Odin. I rooted, got into CWM, tried to install the package and Gapp.


I got an error in the middle of the installation of CM10 (On CWM recovery). I was about to give up since JB's out in about a month but now, I'm stucked with an even bigger problem: The Play Store doesn't work anymore (Always on server error, tried to clear data on application and root reinstall seems to be the only solution left).


Where I am right now, getting CM10 installed seems to be the logical solution. If anyone is willing to help me, I'll told him what I did yet and what is the error I get on the phone.


Thanks for your help guys.

**Update 9/Sep/2012 -**
Based on the discussion in this forum, I went ahead and purchased the Sandisk 64 GB SDXC card and while I was on Samsung ICS stock ROM it worked just fine. I have since flashed to CyanogenMod 9 (stable) and the card showed up as not recognized/damaged. I used the accompanying Sandisk sdcard reader, put it into an available laptop with SD Card slot, ran a chkdsk /F &lt;drive&gt; /X command and enabled the ability to copy files across temporarily. Tried formatting as FAT32 but Windows 7 says its too large for FAT32. There are lots of problems with open source support for exFAT primarily due to Microsoft's patents on it - may god bless us all. in the meantime, the choice is either go back to Samsung Stock ROM, or stick with Cyanogen and forget you can use exFAT support.

**Update 20/Oct/2012**
I wish I'd known about this earlier - never too late though. There is a **FREE to download** software called [Paragon NTFS &amp; HFS+](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.paragon.mounter&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5wYXJhZ29uLm1vdW50ZXIiXQ..) While the title only mentions 2 filesystems, I've verified it with the 64GB Sandisk SDXC card and it works perfectly. Even created and deleted files and folders with the software.

1360299334.0	184541	Is WiFi killing my battery?	THIS_IS_ME_LURKING	11	3	15	"So I got my Galaxy S3 for Christmas this year, and am loving it. I like the motion features and other stuff Samsung put on it with TouchWiz. It's an amazing phone. The only problem is my battery life.

I've googled the problem many times, but don't come up with anything substantial. I'll lose 10% an hour just idle, and I can't figure out what's keeping my phone from deep sleep. I always see the wifi download indicator flashing about every three seconds or so, and looking at my battery stats, the wifi radio is **always** on, even when I don't use my phone (and all apps are killed). The indicator also goes off when I'm on LTE, and I can't figure out what's causing it.

I guess what I'm asking is: Is this causing my phone to drain so rapidly, and if so, what is causing it? I've turned off sync for literally everything I can think of too!

None of these are constant, but they happen often enough to take note. Maybe once or twice a week?

* GPS has trouble locking on (it hasn't done this in a couple weeks now)
* Bluetooth will suddenly just turn off. No warning.
* Occasionally bluetooth will connect but sound will continue coming out of the phone speaker. Reboot required

It is not the sun icon with a 1 in the middle, in case you were wondering. It is a sun icon that has two clock hands inside of it. To me it looks like an analog clock without numbers. The sun icon idea came from reading forums about other users seeing a weird icon above their am/pm. 

My Google Fu has turned up nothing. Everything mentions the 1 in the middle of the sun icon. I have read the manual cover to cover, I have looked up on the official site for information and explanation of the icons. I have read every title on this sub reddit looking for the answer. I have turned up nothing, but not for lack of trying. 

I have tried clearing out any notifications, I always have 0, icon still there. I have turned off my alarm widgets, I have nothing set in the calendar, like a reminder or something. I have tried rebooting the phone, turning it off and turning it back on, closing the widget (I guess it could be closing the widget) by taking it off the home screen and putting it in the trash. Its still there. And, every picture I look up online, it doesn't show this icon. 

Anyone else seen this icon besides myself? Anyone know what it means? Not a huge deal, but, the fact that I can't find the answer online has driven me to seek it out as much as I have already.

However if you want to be absolutely sure, install an extra dialer into your phone as that's where the exploit apparently resides, by doing this when you open a malicious site, the phone will ask which dialer you want to use, notifying you that something is wrong. On my phone it didn't affect using the dialer normally in any way, doesn't pop up when I go into contacts or dial etc.

So install any pushed updates, install any other dialer if you want extra sure and don't open scary urls when sitting on the toilet (or where ever you like to browse web on your phone)

1/2 way through the second charge: http://imgur.com/Q3wGs1Y,E050p3e#1


3 days into the second charge with light to moderate use (i747 AT&amp;T with w/ stock ROM) and still at 43% charge... I'm pretty happy with the results so far.  On the first charge, the percentage meter went up and down towards the end of the charge.  Not sure why that happened.  It's extra weight has actually caused the phone to feel better in my hand, but not in my pocket.  The added weight and depth take up a bit more space in my pockets, but the extra battery length more than makes up for that. 



The TPU case fits pretty well, and I haven't had a problem with it's fit.  It actually has the best fit out of any extended battery case out there.  Many other cases create a shadow around the rear camera because of their depth.  ZeroLemon has taken the extra mile to make a nice form fitting TPU case for the rear LED, camera &amp; speaker ports.  


ZeroLemon recommends that you fully charge to 100% and then discharge to 2% for at least 5-6 cycles.  I'm on my 2nd cycle of battery use and will make another review after the last recommended battery cycle.

Of course, there's some annoyances:

* The stock browser no longer zooms in and out when I slide my thumb up the far left or right of the window (can this be fixed in a setting?)

TL;DR I am getting the notorious ""Sudden Death"" on my i9300 (INTERNATIONAL)

At this point I've been able to narrow it down to an issue with the charging port and not the battery itself, as i can use another battery and my phone will turn on but not charge.

At this point my plan is to try and return it back to stock (It's ROMed with JellyBam) and send it in to get fixed as its still under warranty. My primary issue is that i cannot connect my phone to a computer because of the defective USB jack, and thus, don't know how i would go about returning it to factory defaults (no root or anything custom) without a computer.

TL;DR I need to eliminate root and return back to stock Firmware without using a computer.

I'm currently using swiftkey 3 which is super laggy, like 1-2 seconds for key presses to be registered. I've tried using the stock keyboard and kii keyboard but they are still a little unresponsive. I see it in other places like unlocking my phone and switching between landscape and portrait. I think it may be a memory problem; it seems a little high. Right now it's at 1.15/1.56 and when I use the clear memory option it only goes down to about .6/1.56. Is this normal usage? I'm only using 5.06/12.05gbs of storage.

1360270315.0	1834b8	Samsung is trying to rob me of my money, I need hardware advice.	Golden161	17	9	14	"8 days ago,  [I posted a problem that involved my S3.](http://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS3/comments/17kd1p/dear_redditors_of_s3_is_my_stock_galaxy_earphones/) I diagnosed the problem to be a fault in the earphone socket. The socket seems to be misaligned so when you put earphones in, the poles do not correctly make contact with the socket. This means I only can hear audio out of my left earphone.

I took the advice off Reddit of getting it replaced or repaired. Since I had the phone after 28 days I have to get it repaired. From the store I bought it from It was then sent to Samsung's repair centre.

Six days later, today, I get a response from them.

&gt; ""Sir, our engineer has reported that your phone has had liquid damage and we need to replace the PBA board"". 

Because the phone **""has had liquid damage""** this means my warranty is void and therefore I will have to pay for the repair estimated at a staggering £130/ €153/ $204!

I couldn't believe what I was hearing! I've had the S3 for precisely 41 days until I turned the phone in for repair. Along with it I bought a screen protector and a strong case cover too. Within that time I've carried it around like it was my baby and never had any accident with any liquid.

[The PBA board as you know is the main motherboard of the S3.] (http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w122/omygodisitme/repair10_zps0188b085.png)To my knowledge the PBA board is not the problem here. [It's the audio socket that needs replacement.](http://i00.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v0/660109026_2/wholesale-free-shipping-White-Audio-Jack-Buzzer-Ringer-Loud-Sound-Speaker-For-Samsung-Galaxy-S3-i9300.jpg)

The report given to the repair centre by my phones retailer was: 
&gt;""Poor Audio""

On their part that was incredibly brief to what I've said.

If I'm not mistaken I believe the engineer has overlooked my phone and marked my S3 as liquid damage after *supposedly* seeing the liquid sensor has been tripped and then concluded that the most expensive part of the phone needs replacement.


**I would like advice to whether I have grounds to challenge the manager where I bought my S3 from, that my phone should be repaired at no cost for the audio socket and not the PBA board.**"	t5_2u1ok	True
