*Dear Redditors,*

*Ever since the visit of one of your Dear Leaders, Alexis ""kn0thing"" Ohanian, my inbox has been orangered with pleas to ""Restore Truthiness."" The track record of your hivemind speaks for itself. Mr. Splashypants got a name. You rescued Soapier. You frightened the sweet-and-sour Jesus out of a 90-year-old man on his birthday. Despite how silly and nonsexual reddit can be, your true colors show when someone is in need.*

*I almost had a pregnant when I saw what you had done at DonorsChoose.org for classrooms around the country. I am humbled and honored (a rare combination for me), and find myself wishing there was a Look of Approval.*

*You have inspired me by helping untold thousands of students; with the momentum you've created, we could stage a hundred rallies. I might just call on you, Redditors - for nothing is more terrifying than tens of thousands of Heroes taking to the streets with the faint odor of bacon wafting behind them. Except for bears, obviously.*

*One huge upvote for you.*

*Sir Dr. Stephen T. Colbert, DFA*

I hope you understand why. Here's the original post, followed up an update:

----

The drive to organize a Stephen Colbert rally continues to snowball. Over
5,000 people have subscribed to [/r/ColbertRally](/r/ColbertRally). It's gotten a stunning redesign. And now, the community wants to show
that it's not just another lame Internet petition.

See, anyone can join a reddit or Facebook group or sign a petition. It takes, like,
one minute and doesn't demonstrate much effort. So the rally movement has been looking
for ways to show that they're serious, that they're willing to lift a finger
to make this happen. And an idea has just been hatched: pony up some cash to one of
Stephen's favorite charities.

Stephen Colbert is a board member of a non-profit called DonorsChoose.org. It's
a place where schoolteachers can make a request for the supplies they need
and aren't getting. As the name suggests, donors get to choose which specific
teacher they want to support (lazy donors can just let the charity decide). If ""Restore
Truthiness"" can raise a large sum of money, it will be a fantastic show of
strength. And even if it fails as a publicity stunt, it'll still make a
difference in our world.

Speaking of stunts, we at reddit would like to do our part to help propel
this cause: [Hillary Clinton's
been helping DonorsChoose raise money since
2008](http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/164383/march-19-2008/pennsylvania-primary).
So far, she's been able to raise
$29,945. That's
good, but we think the reddit and ColbertRally.com communities can blow that
number away in less than a week. So as an added incentive: if we do just
that, reddit has convinced a certain anonymous investor to throw in another $1000 on top of that.

Let's get this started: **[here's where you can donate, and see how much has been raised so far.](http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?id=39361)**

----

**Update, 20:30 PDT:** You guys are donating so hard, you broke DonorsChoose.org's reporting system! (Don't worry, no transactions were lost and no teachers were injured.) 

While their engineers are scrambling to fix the problem, we've gotten the following stats, manually tallied, [straight from their rep](http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/ddc0w/update_on_the_colbert_rally_time_to_show_our/c0zec06):

* Eight hours.
* 1,380 unique donors.
* **$46,983** (soon to go up by $1000 once I contact the aforementioned anonymous benefactor)

*Wow!*

This idea struck a chord with the reddit community, and it spread out across the internet. Mainstream media picked up the story.

For some time now, the reddit privacy policy has been a bit of legal boilerplate. While it did its job, it does not give a clear picture on how we actually approach user privacy. I'm happy to announce that this is changing.

The reddit privacy policy has been rewritten from the ground-up. **The new text can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy)**. This new policy is a clear and direct description of how we handle your data on reddit, and the steps we take to ensure your privacy.

To develop the new policy, we enlisted the help of Lauren Gelman (/u/LaurenGelman). Lauren is the founder of [BlurryEdge Strategies](http://www.blurryedge.com/), a legal and strategy consulting firm located in San Francisco that advises technology companies and investors on cutting-edge legal issues. She previously worked at Stanford Law School's Center for Internet and Society, the EFF, and [ACM](http://www.acm.org/).

Lauren will be helping answer questions in the thread today regarding the new policy. Please let us know if there are any questions or concerns you have about the policy. We're happy to take input, as well as answer any questions we can.

The new policy is going into effect on **May 15th, 2013**. This delay is intended to give people a chance to discover and understand the document.

Please take some time to read to the new policy. User privacy is of utmost importance to us, and we want anyone using the site to be as informed as possible.

cheers,

1329084338.0	pmj7f	A necessary change in policy	reddit	44847	41874	13146	"At reddit we care deeply about not imposing ours or anyone elses’ opinions on how people use the reddit platform. We are adamant about not limiting the ability to use the reddit platform even when we do not ourselves agree with or condone a specific use. We have very few rules here on reddit; no spamming, no cheating, no personal info, nothing illegal, and no interfering the site's functions. **Today we are adding another rule: No suggestive or sexual content featuring minors.**  

In the past, we have always dealt with content that might be child pornography along strict legal lines. We follow legal guidelines and reporting procedures outlined by [NCMEC](http://www.missingkids.com/missingkids/servlet/PageServlet?PageId=1504). We have taken all reports of illegal content seriously, and when warranted we made reports directly to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, who works directly with the FBI. When a situation is reported to us where a child might be abused or in danger, we make that report. Beyond these clear cut cases, there is a huge area of legally grey content, and our previous policy to deal with it on a case by case basis has become unsustainable. We have changed our policy because interpreting the vague and debated legal guidelines on a case by case basis has become a massive distraction and risks reddit being pulled in to legal quagmire.   
 
As of today, we have banned all subreddits that focus on sexualization of children. Our goal is to be fair and consistent, so if you find a subreddit we may have missed, please message the admins. If you find specific content that meets this definition please message the moderators of the subreddit, and the admins.  
 
We understand that this might make some of you worried about the slippery slope from banning one specific type of content to banning other types of content. We're concerned about that too, and do not make this policy change lightly or without careful deliberation. We will tirelessly defend the right to freely share information on reddit in any way we can, even if it is offensive or discusses something that may be illegal. However, child pornography is a toxic and unique case for Internet communities, and we're protecting reddit's ability to operate by removing this threat. We remain committed to protecting reddit as an open platform."	t5_2qh49	True
1366745949.0	1cyfrk	DDoS dossier	alienth	16689	13726	2421	"Hola all,

We've been getting a lot of questions about the DDoS that happened recently. Frankly there aren't many juicy bits to tell. We also have to be careful on what we share so that the next attacker doesn't have an instruction booklet on exactly what is needed to take reddit down. That said, here is what I will tell you:


* The attack started at roughly 0230 PDT on the 19th and immediately took the site down. We were completely down for a period of 50 minutes while we worked to mitigate the attack.

* For a period of roughly 8 hours we were continually adjusting our mitigation strategy, while the attacker adjusted his attack strategy (for a completely realistic demonstration of what this looked like, please refer to [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=2efhrCxI4J0#t=145s)). 

* The attack had subsided by around 1030 PDT, bringing the site from threatcon fuchsia to threatcon turquoise.

* The mitigation efforts had some side effects such as API calls and user logins failing. We always try to avoid disabling site functionality, but it was necessary in this case to ensure that the site could function at all.

* The pattern of the attack clearly indicated that this was a malicious attempt aimed at taking the site down. For example, thousands of separate IP addresses all hammering illegitimate requests, and all of them simultaneously changing whenever we would move to counter.

* At peak the attack was resulting in [400,000 requests per second](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditTraffic/comments/1cq6q0/20130419_graph_of_the_ddos_event/) at our CDN layer; 2200% over our [previous record peak](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditTraffic/comments/1cq6q0/20130419_graph_of_the_ddos_event/c9iy2jf) of 18,000 requests per second. 

* Even when serving 400k requests a second, a large amount of the attack wasn't getting responded to at all due to various layers of congestion. This suggests that the attacker's capability was higher than what we were even capable of monitoring.

* The attack was sourced from thousands of IPs from all over the place(i.e. a botnet). The attacking IPs belonged to everything from hacked mailservers to computers on residential ISPs.

* There is no evidence from the attack itself which would suggest a motive or reasoning.

**&lt;conjecture&gt;**

I'd say the most likely explanation is that someone decided to take us down for shits and giggles. There was a lot of focus on reddit at the time, so we were an especially juicy target for anyone looking to show off. DDoS attacks we've received in the past have proven to be motivated as such, although those attacks were of a much smaller scale. Of course, without any clear evidence from the attack itself we can't say anything for certain.

**&lt;/conjecture&gt;**


On the post-mortem side, I'm working on shoring up our ability to handle such attacks. While the scale of this attack was completely unprecedented for us, it is something that is becoming more and more common on the internet. We'll never be impervious, but we can be more prepared.

to manipulate reddit. Now, we're certainly not going to claim that
we're invulnerable to all possible present and future attacks (lest we attract unwanted attention from bored geniuses),
but in the five-and-a-half years that we've been running this site, a
lot of scummy people have tried a lot of scummy things, and we've
gotten pretty good at defending against them. It's been a long time
since anyone came up with a trick that we haven't seen ten times before.

Unfortunately, it's not enough to thwart the
cheaters. The mere *rumor* of cheating can itself be dangerous: If enough
people believe it, it undermines the trust and cooperation that make
our community work.

That's why we were annoyed last month when Forbes published [a stunningly irresponsible, sensationalist piece](http://blogs.forbes.com/elizabethwoyke/2010/11/10/240-to-place-story-on-digg-front-page-one-marketing-firms-pitch/) that reads like a press release for one of these manipulation companies. There's a link to their site, they give the name of the sales rep, list their services (e.g., $80-$200 to game your link onto the reddit frontpage), discuss bulk
discounts, and describe a client who supposedly saw pageviews rise
5000%. Even their slimy motto made it into the article: ""You talk, and
we make the world listen.""

I wrote to the author the day the piece was published, asking her to
actually test the claims she was repeating. She politely declined.

----

So why are we talking about this today? Well, last night the company
in question wrote to a
number of high-karma redditors, trying to tempt them over to the dark
side. Fortunately, a few [Bothans](http://everything2.com/title/Many+Bothans+died+to+bring+us+this+information) relayed the message on to us, and we've decided to publish an excerpt:

&gt; I work with [repugnant company], a social media agency that promotes clients on sites just like Reddit ... The problem is that our accounts suck :( and we don’t know how to promote on Reddit, and as a result our submissions go nowhere with no votes other than our own single vote from submitting it. What I’m asking is if you would be willing to work with us? We would send you something, and if you think it’s great social media quality content, you could help us promote it through your account. We would of course be willing to pay for your time and effort to push it if you’d be interested.

Now, as much as we want to avoid insulting redditors' intelligence, we're going
to spell out very clearly a number of things you should already know:

1. We know of no company that can successfully manipulate
reddit, though many advertise that they can. The closest success that comes to mind is the ""designer rolex sneakers!"" spam that sometimes appears in the comments before being downvoted, reported, and removed from the site.
2. If you pay a company to game reddit for you,
you're a sucker and you're throwing your money away. Not only will it not work, our anti-cheating code tends to overreact, and you may find it harder than ever to get your links on reddit.
3. If you try to sell your vote to such a company, beware that you
might not actually get paid. (""Oh, I know these guys are dishonorable
toward everyone else in the world, but I'm sure they'll treat
*me* fairly!"")
4. If we catch you attempting to cheat, particularly by joining a voting ring,
you may find your reddit experience... degraded.

Finally, and most importantly of all:

If you have something that you want to promote on reddit, and are
willing to spend money to do it, **[just buy a sponsored link!](/ad_inq)**
It's twenty damn dollars, you won't have a guilty conscience,
you'll help support reddit, and most importantly of all, *it will
actually work.*"	t5_2qh49	True

It's incredible to think that, back when I started working at reddit five years ago, our *monthly* traffic totals were 38k uniques and 750k impressions (incredibly we now do more than that every *hour*), [there was no commenting](http://web.archive.org/web/20051031043311/http://www.reddit.com/), and we were just beginning to undertake [a drastic site rewrite from lisp into an exotic new language called python](http://blog.reddit.com/2005/12/on-lisp.html).

Though over the years we've had a fair share of bumps and outages, I daresay we are now thriving, and after a lot of thought I've decided to leave reddit (the job part anyway) on a high note.  This community has accomplished so much in the last few months (to say nothing of the previous years) that I can't help to be humbled and proud to have been a part of it.  I feel like my affinity for this community (and to some extent what I see on the site and what I just got to [witness](http://i.imgur.com/8R5nY.png) on the Mall in DC) is closer to patriotism than I would have believed possible in what is, on the surface and to an outsider, an exercise in Text with Strangers.

With the patriotic analogy in mind, I'm not sure if I should be saying ""I'm moving on from my job at reddit"" or ""I hearby resign the office of a reddit employee effective immediately"".  Nah.  Too formal.  How about ""I hearby pass the mop...""?

We'll be putting up another round of job postings soon...and have some good news about the last round that will be coming soon in another blog post. 

Either way, I love this community, and though I'm turning in my company keyboard, I'll be sticking around thank-you-very-much.  To kill any conspiracy theories in the cradle, my parting with Conde Nast has been nothing but amicable.  I have no doubt I'll be partaking in an odd job now and again on the site.  As we've so oft been glad to point out when someone else asks for a feature, [we're open source](http://code.reddit.com/) after all.

In an interesting coincidence, I got [nominated to redditor of the day](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditoroftheday/comments/dzl1t/keysersosa_redditor_of_the_day_november_1_2010/) a little while back and finally got around to answering my questionnaire (not to say I'm finding my time to be any freer these days).  Feel free to AMA here or there.

As for me, I'm going back to start-up life.  I'm a sucker for an interesting problem, and I'll be back to working with [spez](http://www.reddit.com/user/spez) at his new company [hipmunk](http://www.hipmunk.com/) (I hope you'll pardon an old admin a plug on a new project.

moderator is, and what the difference is between moderators and admins.

* There are only five reddit admins: KeyserSosa, jedberg, ketralnis,
hueypriest, and raldi. They have a red [A] next to their names when
speaking officially. They are paid employees of reddit, and thus Conde
Nast, and their superpowers work site-wide. Whenever possible, they
try not to use them, and instead defer to moderators and the community as a whole. You can write to the admins
[here](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=%23reddit.com).

* There are thousands of moderators. You can become one right now just by creating a reddit.

* Moderators are not employees of Conde Nast. They don't care whether or not you install AdBlock, so installing AdBlock to protest a moderator decision is stupid. The only ways to hurt a moderator are to unsubscribe from their community or to start a competing community.

* [Moderator powers are very
limited](http://www.reddit.com/help/faq#Moderators),
 and can in fact be enumerated right here:

   * They configure parameters for the community, like what its
description should be or whether it should be considered ""Over 18"".
   * They set the custom logo and styling, if any.
   * They can mark a link or comment as an official community
submission, which just adds an ""[M]"" and turns their name green.
   * They can remove links and comments from their community if they find them objectionable (spam, porn, etc).
   * They can ban a spammer or other abusive user from submitting to
their reddit altogether (This has no effect elsewhere on the site).
   * They can add other users as moderators.

* Moderators have no site-wide authority or special powers outside of
the community they moderate.

* You can write to the moderators of a community by clicking the
""message the moderators"" link in the right sidebar.

If you're familiar with IRC, it might help you to understand that we
built this system with the IRC model in mind: moderators take on the
role of channel operators, and the admins are the staff that run the
servers."	t5_2qh49	True

1363884990.0	1aqp5c	Quick update about ads on reddit	jenakalif	8159	6223	1153	"As you [may have noticed](http://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1amdz9/does_reddit_work_with_doubleclick_and_adzerk_now/) browsing reddit the past couple of weeks, we have been phasing in a new ad provider called [Adzerk](http://www.adzerk.com/) to serve the image ads in the sidebar. We will be joining the likes of [Stack Exchange](http://stackexchange.com/) in using Adzerk's platform, which is flexible, powerful, and fast.

Our primary goal is to make advertisements on reddit as useful and non-intrusive as possible. We take great pride in the fact that reddit is one of the few sites where people actively disable ad blockers. reddit does not allow animated or visually distracting ads, and whenever possible, we try to use ads as a force of good in our communities.

We've started to turn on Adzerk in a few subreddits like /r/funny and /r/sports, and they'll be replacing DoubleClick for Publishers and our own house system ads completely moving forward. Practically speaking, you probably won't notice much difference from this change, but Adzerk does provide us some really cool features. For example, if you dislike a particular ad in the sidebar, it is now possible to hide it from showing again. If you hover over a sidebar ad in /r/sports, a new ""thumbs up"" / ""thumbs down"" overlay will appear. If you ""thumbs down"" an ad, we won't display it to you again, and you can give us feedback to improve the quality of reddit ads in the future.

If you’d like to continue the conversation around ads on reddit, please stop by the /r/ads subreddit!"	t5_2qh49	True

1284646261.0	depct	...and now for a word from our sponsor (because for once we have one *asking* to hear your feedback).	KeyserSosa	4016	2147	3339	"Yesterday, reddit started running ads for a new sponsor. While we normally
don't introduce new campaigns [insert joke about never having a campaign to
announce], this one is notable because the advertiser actually seems to
understand what reddit can offer that traditional advertising (even
traditional *web* advertising) cannot.

See, Microsoft is getting ready to release Internet Explorer 9, and they
reached out to us because they genuinely want to start a dialog with the
reddit community. **In fact, they've taken the unprecedented step of putting
the reddit team in charge of this entire campaign.** This is a great deal of
trust for an advertiser to offer, and we should both take it as a huge
compliment.

So, how should we do this? If there's one thing I've learned in my five-plus
years at reddit, it's that the direct and open approach works best, so
instead of marketspeak, I'm going to paste a quote from
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_9):

&gt; IE9 will have complete or nearly complete support for all CSS 3 selectors,
&gt; border-radius CSS 3 property, faster JavaScript, and embedded ICC v2 or v4
&gt; color profiles support via Windows Color System. IE9 will feature
&gt; hardware-accelerated graphics rendering using Direct2D, hardware
&gt; accelerated text rendering using DirectWrite, hardware accelerated video
&gt; rendering using Media Foundation, imaging support provided by Windows
&gt; Imaging Component, and high fidelity printing powered by the XPS print
&gt; pipeline. IE9 also supports the HTML5 video and audio tags and the Web
&gt; Open Font Format.

If you have a computer that can run IE9, we'd really like you to **[try it out](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9743529)**
and post a review. The actual IE9 programmers are going to read what you
have to say, and if you compliment their work, it'll totally make their
day. But they also need to hear your complaints. Ideally, in the form of
constructive criticism, but we warned them that reddit can sometimes be a
little... brisk, so they're prepared for that, too.

One last thing: Microsoft's not the only ones who want your feedback. We at
team reddit are interested in hearing what you think of this campaign in a
general sense: do you find this kind of advertising more appealing than
sidebar ads? Do you have any suggestions as to how it could be even
better? (Especially things that could never happen in a magazine.)

Oh, and stay tuned for a Microsoft IamA next week.  We're not sure who it will be with yet, but we've been assured it won't just be with flack. "	t5_2qh49	True

Create and share your own collections of subreddits using multireddits.	chromakode	9852	8025	1881	"I'm pleased to announce that after 2 months in beta, our new [multireddits functionality](http://blog.reddit.com/2013/06/browse-future-of-reddit-re-introducing.html) is now live. :)

Think of multireddits as collections of subreddits that you discover or create &amp;mdash; a custom front page of reddit for any topic / interest / state of mind. Multis can be tools to aggregate your favorite networks of subreddits or to showcase a variety of different perspectives.

And, most importantly: they can be shared. Interested in [retro gaming](http://www.reddit.com/user/multi-mod/m/retrogaming)? There's a multi for that. How about a bunch of [drawing communities](http://www.reddit.com/user/multi-mod/m/drawing)? Here's a [multi filled with jokes](http://www.reddit.com/user/multi-mod/m/jokes). Personally, I like to divide my browsing between fun, quick [brain candy subreddits](http://www.reddit.com/user/chromakode/m/candy) and longer form [interesting subreddits](http://www.reddit.com/user/chromakode/m/interesting).

Any multis you create and set as public will appear on the sidebar of your user page. You can share them by URL or by referencing the name in comments like this: /u/reddit/m/redditpets. You can also easily discover multis by browsing /r/multihub, a user-created community dedicated to sharing and discussing multireddits. If you like a multi you find there (or on another user's page), you can make it your own with just a single click. Just click the ""create a copy"" button on the sidebar.

If you're signed in, you'll notice that we've also added a left sidebar to the front page to make it easy to flip between your personal multireddits. You can hide this bar if you like by clicking on the vertical divider between the left sidebar and the page.

Today is only the first step for multireddits; there's many more tools and features that we'd like to add in the future. We have some really cool beta tests coming up for the following improvements:

 * /u/shlurbee and /u/ketralnis have been working on automatic suggestions for which subreddits to add to your multi.
 * /u/bsimpson and I have been exploring adding controls to weight the prominence of subreddits in your multis differently.

You can try out these features first and support new development by subscribing to reddit gold. Keep an eye on /r/multibeta, where we will announce more details in the next few days. Thanks to everyone who has contributed feedback so far in /r/multibeta &amp;mdash; it has been invaluable in polishing today's release.

As always, we'd love to hear your feedback and some of your favorite new multireddits!"	t5_2qh49	True

until about a week ago when, in a burst of Colbert excitement (and for the
lulz), [we temporarily changed it to ""where dreams come
true""](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/dezvb/breaking_colbert_rally_is_confirmed_for_october/c0zpxxh?context=1).

We were about to change it back just now, but we realized that ""what's new
online"" doesn't really say very much about reddit or why it's special. When
those words were written, we were just a link aggregator -- not only were
there no self posts, there weren't even *comments.* We're a very different site these days.

On one hand, oldschool redditors often feel we've strayed too far from our original mission of being a stark list of interesting new links with a high [SNR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio). Others *like* the community aspect, preferring reddit to be a place where people hang out, get to know each other, and make their own news.

What do you think? Can it be both? And what words should appear in the title?

reserve the right to ignore the most-upvoted suggestion if it's something like ""reddit.com: stupid crap for morons"")*

Big thanks to Prof. Chomsky for sharing so much of his time with our community!   

Make sure you watch [Prof. Chomsky's question BACK to the reddit community](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke6YXjaZ9HY#t=29m35s) 

**Notes:**

Prof. Chomsky answers the top 3 questions in this 30 minute interview. He has said he will try to answer another 5 via email, but is extremely busy this year and will try to get to it when he can. I will post these as soon as I get them, but he has already been very generous with his time, so there is no promise he will be able to get to these.  

Midway through the interview the laptop behind Professor Chomsky goes into screensaver mode and an annoying word of the day type thing comes on. This is MY laptop, and I left it on the desk after we were showing Professor Chomsky all the questions on reddit. Please direct any ridicule for this screensaver at me.

This interview took a month to publish. This is not really acceptable, and I apologize. We were waiting in hopes of combining the video with the additional text answers. This decision is entirely my fault, so please direct any WTF took so long comments about the length of time to publish at me. Thanks for being patient. We will be making our video and interview process even more transparent in the next few days for those that want to help or just want to know all the details.

Big thanks to TheSilentNumber for helping set up this interview and assisting in the production. Any redditor who helps us get an interview is more than welcome to come to the shoot. [PM me](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=hueypriest) if there's someone you think we should interview and you want to help make it happen.

Animation intro was created by redditor Justin Metz @ [juicestain.com](http://www.juicestain.com). Opening music is from ""Plume"" by [Silence](http://www.jamendo.com/en/artist/silence)  

[Here's a link to the website of the UK journal he mentions](http://www.freedompress.org.uk/news/) - thanks [ieshido](http://www.reddit.com/user/ieshido)

*edit:* Here are the books that have been identified on his desk with the redditor who found them in (). Let me know if I made a mistake. If you are on the list, PM me your address. Some of these books say they'll take 2-4 weeks to ship others 24 hours, so be patient. If a redditor on the amazon wants to make one of those listmania things for the Chomsky desk collection that would be cool.

What are some of your criticisms of today's Anarchist movement? How to be as effective as possible is something many anarchists overlook and you are perhaps the most prolific voice on this topic so your thoughts would be very influential.

3. [BerserkRL](http://www.reddit.com/user/BerserkRL/)   
Question: Although as an anarchist you favour a stateless society in the long run, you've argued that it would be a mistake to work for the elimination of the state in the short run, and that indeed we should be trying to strengthen the state right now, because it's needed as a check on the power of large corporations. Yet the tendency of a lot of anarchist research -- your own research most definitely included, though I would also mention in particular Kevin Carson's -- has been to show that the power of large corporations derives primarily from state privilege (which, together with the fact that powerful governments tend to get captured by concentrated private interests at the expense of the dispersed public, would seem to imply that the most likely beneficiary of a more powerful state is going to be the same corporate elite we're trying to oppose). If business power both derives from the state and is so good at capturing the state, why isn't abolishing the state a better strategy for defeating business power than enhancing the state's power would be?

1297436087.0	fjgit	reddit is doubling the size of its programming team	redditjobs	2207	1253	973	"Earlier this week we announced four new hires, and today we'd like to get started on the next batch: **We're hiring three more engineers!** Ideally, we'd like to get a frontend programmer, a backend programmer, and someone in between. (We're going to need a wider [blog.reddit.com](http://blog.reddit.com/) header!)

To get an idea of what sort of people we're looking for, take a look at [last summer's hiring announcement](http://blog.reddit.com/2010/08/reddit-is-hiring.html). (Seriously, go read it; we'll wait.)

----

**Quick facts**

* Unlike last summer's opening, these will be regular, full-time-employee positions
* They will come with all the standard benefits
* :( We still can't sponsor H1-B's (You have to be legally able to work in the United States already)
* The position is at Reddit HQ in San Francisco [[map](http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;q=reddit%20hq&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=520+3rd+St,+San+Francisco,+California+94107&amp;t=h&amp;z=16)] (We're not sticklers about the whole ""in the office every day by 9am"" thing, but these are definitely not telecommuting positions)

----

**How to apply**

Usually the first step of an application process is to solicit resumes. Candidates are forced to boil years of work down to a few bullet points, attempting to demonstrate what sets them apart without being overly verbose or picking the wrong font. And writing cover letters -- yuck! You stare at your email composition window, sweating over every word and punctuation mark. *Do I sign it ""Yours"" or ""Sincerely""? If I pick the wrong one they won't hire me!*

And then *we* have to read through hundreds of resumes and cover letters (even though the very fact that we're hiring means we have a big backlog of other stuff that needs to get done) and pass them around and scratch our heads, trying to figure out who's the real deal and who's dead-wood-plus-exaggeration. It's like trying to pick the best cellphone by comparing the manufacturers' press releases.

Instead of *first* doing all that, and *then* bringing people in to see if they can code, we're going to do the opposite. So at this first step of the process, we're not yet interested in your resumes or cover letters or references or GPAs. We'll address that if you survive to the second stage; the first thing we want to do is narrow it down to the hackers. 

So we've prepared two challenges. They both reflect real-world problems that we've had to solve -- one at the beginning of reddit's existence, and one that arose when the site became really popular. The first is targeted at front-end wizards, those who might not know how to write database code but wow are they a UI master. The second is for the kind of person who prefers a dark basement and a Unix prompt, someone who hates having to touch the mouse and who might be allergic to CSS.

Pick the one that best suits your talents and see if you can tackle it. **Don't do both.**

----

**Frontend challenge**

We want you to build a reddit clone entirely in HTML, Javascript, and CSS. It will maintain its state entirely client-side (HTML5
localstorage, cookies, whatever), and it's fine for it to be single-user. In fact, we want to leave as much of this challenge open to  interpretation as possible.

The goal here is to show off your ability to make a slick website, not to make something that we're going to deploy in production, so you don't have to worry about scaling, spam, cheating, or even making it browser-portable. If there's some really neat thing that you need Javascript list comprehensions for, or your textareas look best with `-moz-border-style:chickenfeet`, go ahead and use it. We'll defer the drudgery of cross-browser testing and compatibility hacks for when you're on the payroll; for now, just tell us what OS and browser to use (within reason) and that's the one we'll use to judge your work.

----

**Backend challenge**

Like all websites, reddit keeps logs of every hit. We roll them every morning at around 7am and keep the last five days uncompressed. Each of those files is about 70-72 GB. Here's a sample line; IPs have been changed for privacy reasons and linebreaks have been added for legibility:

    Feb 10 10:59:49 web03 haproxy[1631]: 10.350.42.161:58625 [10/Feb/2011:10:59:49.089] frontend
    pool3/srv28-5020 0/138/0/19/160 200 488 - - ---- 332/332/13/0/0 0/15 {Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; 
    Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.7) Gecko/20100713 Firefox/3.6.7|www.reddit.com|
    http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/?count=75&amp;after=t3_fiic6|201.8.487.192|17.86.820.117|}
    ""POST /api/vote HTTP/1.1"" 

We often have to find the log line corresponding to an event -- a ""you broke reddit"" or a weird thing someone saw or to investigate cheating. We used to do it like this:

    $ grep '^Feb 10 10:13' haproxy.log &gt; /tmp/extraction.txt

But as traffic grew, it started taking longer and longer. First it was ""run the command, get a cup of coffee, check the results."" Then it was, ""run the command, read all today's rage comics, check the results."" When it got longer than *that*, we realized we needed to do something.

So we wrote a tool called `tgrep` and it works like this:

    $ tgrep 8:42:04
    [log lines with that precise timestamp]
    $ tgrep 10:01
    [log lines with timestamps between 10:01:00 and 10:01:59]
    $ tgrep 23:59-0:03
    [log lines between 23:59:00 and 0:03:59]

By default it uses `/logs/haproxy.log` as the input file, but you can specify an alternate filename by appending it to the command line. It also works if you prepend it, because who has time to remember the order of arguments for every little dumb script?

Most importantly, `tgrep` is *fast*, because it doesn't look at every line in the file. It jumps around, checking timestamps and doing an interpolative search until it finds the range you're looking for.

For this challenge, reimplement `tgrep`. You can assume that each line starts with a datetime, e.g., `Feb 10 10:52:39` and also that each log contains a single 24-hour period, plus or minus a few minutes. In other words, there will probably be one midnight crossing in the log, but never more than one. The timestamps are always increasing -- we never accidentally put ""Feb 1 6:42:17"" after ""Feb 1 6:42:18"". And our servers don't honor daylight saving time, so you can ignore that whole can of worms. [Edit: you asked for a script to generate a sample log, so [we wrote one](http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/fjgit/reddit_is_doubling_the_size_of_its_programming/c1ge0ri).]

You can use whatever programming language you want. (If you choose Postscript, you're fired.) The three judging criteria, in order of importance:

1. It has to give the right answer, even in all the special cases. (For extra credit, list all the special cases you can think of in your README)
2. It has to be fast. During testing, keep count of how many times you call `lseek()` or `read()`, and then make those numbers smaller. (For extra credit, give us the big-O analysis of the typical case and the worst case)
3. Elegant code is better than spaghetti

----

**Final points**

* When you're ready to submit your work, send a PM to [#redditjobs](/message/compose?to=%23redditjobs&amp;subject=Okay%2c+I%27m+ready+to+apply) and we'll tell you where to send your code. You can also write to that mailbox if you need clarification on anything.
* We'd like all the submissions to be in by Tuesday, February 22.
* Regardless of which project you pick, we ask you to please keep your work private until the end of March. After that, you can do whatever you want with it -- it's your code, after all!
* Graduating college seniors are welcome to apply: for an amazing candidate, we'll wait a few months. But we're not going to let anybody quit school to work for us.
* Some of you might be thinking, ""I can't believe reddit is going to make all these poor applicants slave over a hot emacs for two weeks just for the privilege of being allowed to apply for a dumb old job."" Well, first off, it's supposed to be fun. If you don't see the joy in either of these puzzles, please don't apply. And second, we're not expecting anyone to spend weeks on this, or even days. We aimed to make the challenges something that could be put together in a weekend by the sort of programmer we're looking for. And these people *do* exist -- [this guy](http://www.reddit.com/comments/b0a2z/a_reddit_clone_in_two_evenings_and_666_lines_of/?sort=top) wrote a reddit clone in *assembly* over the course of two evenings with a *dip[ ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zshdZJnD-4I#t=1m26s)pen.* Okay, not with a dip pen. But still, quit yer yappin.

They put it to a [vote](http://www.reddit.com/tb/akcpb/) and **Saturday, June 19th** is the day!  

Mark your calendars and start figuring out how your local redditors are going to celebrate. This will be a loosely organized &amp; non-centralized extravaganza open to redditors in any city, town, or hamlet across the world. Just like [normal meetups](http://www.reddit.com/r/meetup), organizing events in the various locations will be up to redditors in those places.   

We're working on a few fun ideas of ways redditors in different cities and redditors that can't make a physical event can interact with each other through space and time, as well as some possible ideas of activities that all of us might be able to do collectively (group pub quiz maybe?). As always, your ideas are surely much better than anything we could come up with, so post any schemes about how to make the global meetup a day/night that our grandkids will self-post about one day.

We're also looking for some creative ideas and good companies that might want to be involved in helping make this day even more entertaining. So, if anybody knows any local or global companies that might want to participate (example: sponsors for free food/drinks or entertainment in one or more cities), please post or [PM hueypriest](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=hueypriest)."	t5_2qh49	True

[Peter Straub's question BACK to the reddit community](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjz0ABwxm8U#t=32m12s)  

The questions and responses were great, and several of the interviewees send us a note saying how much they enjoyed checking out all the replies to their question. However, we felt that the question and might be getting lost at the end of the interview, so we decided to try have the question asked before, so that the interviewee gets to see your responses and comment on those when we tape the interview.

Intelligence Squared, London's top debating forum, are hosting a discussion on ['The Future of News'](http://events.intelligencesquared.com/current-events.php?event=EVT0215) at 6.45 GMT on Wednesday 24 March. They have a panel featuring leading new media innovators such as Jacob Weisberg, the editor-in-chief of [Slate](http://www.slate.com) and Turi Munthe, the founder of citizen journalism site [Demotix](http://www.demotix.com/). They will be debating with print journalism stalwarts including AA Gill and Matthew Parris. They will debate ""The Future of News"": now that more and more of us expect to get our news free online, who is going to pay for serious journalism? Can old-fashioned investigative reporting - a vital check on the abuse of power - survive in the digital age?  
  
  
The event will be live-streamed on [www.intelligencesquared.com/live](http://www.intelligencesquared.com/live) and will also be available on iPhones at [http://mobile.livestation.com](http://mobile.livestation.com). Previously, the online audience could join the debate by commenting on Facebook and on Twitter. **Now though, for the first time, Intelligence Squared invites reddit users to kick-start the discussion. This reddit thread will be open for questions until 18.00 GMT on Wednesday 24 March. The questions* which receive the most votes in this thread will be posed directly to our panel, and included in the live event, which will be livestreamed online then available on-demand on [itunes](http://www.itunes.com/podcast?id=350343972). So it's over to you - Ask them anything!**

We replicated all of the data off of it this weekend and were planning some downtime to decommission it cleanly when this morning's downtime happened.

Neutrality not being championed by this administration as a First

by having someone at the gateway controlling what we read and write,

seem to be leaning towards siding with large corporations and their
profit motives instead of unrestricted access to information for the

In World War 2, propaganda was everywhere, and by modern standards it
was blatant enough to be comical. In the modern era, it seems like Al
Qaeda is having good success at getting its message out to its
audience using modern social networking type tools, but to many in the
west who have grown up surrounded by this kind of media, what they're
doing hasn't evolved much from the WWII US propaganda.

What changed? Better caching all around.  One of the big problems had last week was that fetching your list of reddits, though cheap, wasn't cheap enough not to bottleneck when a surge of users came through all at once (in, say, a 5 minute interval).  Normally the list of reddits is quite cacheable because the set of language-preferences in a period of time is usually homogeneous, but while World Cup games were going on they were all over the map.

This was a surprise to us, and since this particular use case only came up in the last few weeks with the world cup, we didn't know we had a problem until it was already happening.  We made that part of the code way cheaper, and it seems to have done the trick. [Also, I'm aware that the match in question was between two English speaking countries, but we've seen much the same behavio(u)r for the last week in every match.]

We also made some improvements on comment and messaging pages, and migrated some swaths of the codebase from Python to Cython.  All of these optimizations will be released when we roll out a new public code release this week.  

*tldr*: reddit isn't timing out much any more, and I daresay for the time being is faster than it has been in months.  "	t5_2qh49	True

So we are averaging about 50 deaths a month now in Afghanistan. We have all of this fancy technology over there to fight people who plant bombs in the dirt that they trigger with a 10 year old cell phone, and fire unguided RPG's left over from the Soviets, or shipped in from North Korea that brought down a helicopter this week, and they blow up the supply lines at the border crossing in Pakistan.
Do you believe without all this fancy technology we would have higher casualties?

What do you think about the seemingly double standard towards Pakistan, which is being asked to fight a war started by the US without an adequate initial strategy and too few troops to block movement of taliban/al qaeda into Pakistan. The same war that the US is having difficulty conducting with all it's technical and military resources and then Pakistan with its limited air lift and CAS capability is expected to provide even better results on its side of the border?
When at a time, the Taliban are engaging in talks with Karzai with the active support of the ISAF, why are Pakistani talks with Taliban groups looked down upon? Clearly, Pakistan cannot crush all the various Taliban groups and will have to negotiate with some of them at some point.

With the exception of your Senior Editor, I don't really see any obvious previous connection/interest in military hardware in the profiles of your writers/contributors. Are you gusy writers cutting teeth on milspec or are you milspec people who just happen to know how to write? If the former, how steep was/is the learning curve?
On the topic of cybersecurity/information warfare, one of the greatest sources of confusion for me is determining areas of responsibility between service branches and their associated units. Add in the other DHS agencies and it becomes a nightmare of alphabet soup to try and sort out. Who is supposed to be covering what area? What role does each organization play? Where is the overlap? Could you do an article spelling that stuff out clearly? (This presumes that the agencies/branches know their own roles and where they fit in the US cybersecurity puzzle of course.)

3. phantasmagorical  
Wired has traditionally been a magazine geared towards technology, computers, and pop culture, but the popularity of Danger Room suggests a growing trend in media moving outside of their traditional markets and into more ""niche"" categories. One big example is Rolling Stone, a magazine that is geared towards music-lovers, winning National Magazine awards for writing on the first Marine battalions in Iraq and breaking a story that ultimately cost the top commander in Afghanistan his job
How do you guys feel about this trend in media right now, where smaller markets are covering and breaking stories outside of their usual sphere of influence? Is that something you intended or anticipated from Danger Room's inception?

This question is specifically for Spencer Ackerman.  
As a journalist for the progressive Washington Independent, you reported on various civil liberties issues. This included decrying the administration's plan to assassinate Anwar al-Awlaki, reporting on Omar Khadr's unjust military commission at Guantanamo Bay, and the denial of habeas corpus rights to non-Afghan detainees held at Bagram. In your new position at non-political Wired, it seems as though the focus has moved towards military technology, tactics, and organization. My question is: is there any pressure from your superiors at Danger Room to avoid writing about issues from a 'liberal' perspective? I ask this as a long-time admirer of your work. -bigbopalop

1277997388.0	ckyk1	Neatorama and reddit Present An Unusual Talent Search: Great Talent, Fantastic Or Otherwise (GTFO)	hueypriest	474	330	334	"We're excited to announce that we’ve launched a new collaboration with our friends at [Neatorama](http://www.neatorama.com) to find the best unusual talent on the web.  

As explained in the [YouTube intro](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEFYYrcyZgc), our *Great Talent Fantastic or Otherwise* search is not your usual talent search: we want to find those redditors and Neatoramanauts with the most unusual and odd talents that the mainstream media just wouldn't appreciate.  

If you can belch a Lady Gaga song, juggle forks while doing acrobatics, lick your elbow (try it) or do other (nearly) impossible things with your body, then you may just win!  

*Grand Prize: 1 Apple iPad (or monetary equivalent if you’re outside the USA)*   
Runner-Up Prizes: 5 reddit Alien 4GB flash drives, 5 reddit evolution posters signed by the entire reddit staff, 5 $50 shopping sprees from the NeatoShop.  

**[For contest details and to submit your glorious video, visit Neatorama's YouTube page](http://www.youtube.com/user/neatorama)**.  

What are you waiting for? Record a video and unleash your talent on the Web today (or at least by July 18th)!"	t5_2qh49	True

1270586614.0	bnaxr	Introducing r/redditvideos - collaborate and discuss reddit interviews and other upcoming videos	hueypriest	240	178	39	"Just over a year ago, reddit published it's first video interview and
[Adam Savage from Mythbusters answered your top 10
questions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8jqea8R-bE). Since then
we've published almost 20 video interviews with various illustrious
individuals.  Thank you all for the interviewee suggestions and
feedback, and thanks to the redditors who helped us arrange some of
the interviews!

As we start on year two, we are looking to get more redditors involved
as collaborators, and make the process for these videos more
transparent. We created [r/redditvideos](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditvideos) to
discuss upcoming AMA video interviews as well as other video projects
like [reddit IRLs](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/bi1pc/reddit_pax/).
Subscribe to [r/redditvideos](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditvideos) to find out about
upcoming interviews, give us feedback on videos before they go live to
the public, and possibly collaborate with us if you're a video, sound,
or other professional.  The majority of these interviews were either
recorded by one of the 5 reddit admins or by the interviewee
themselves. We think this lightweight and informal approach keeps our
interviews ""honest and unbuttoned"" as recent interviewee Peter Straub
[said](http://twitter.com/peterstraubnyc/statuses/8889470659). We want
to do more interviews and we want to keep increasing the quality of
the ones we do while keeping them ""honest and unbuttoned"". Even if we
had a budget to hire professionals (we don't), we'd still prefer that
all the work was done by redditors. If you are you a videographer,
animator, editor, sound designer, or other professional that could
help us out, you can volunteer or let us know about your services
[HERE](https://leaptec.wufoo.com/forms/reddit-creators/) (link goes to
form on Wufoo). We really appreciate all the technical and
non-technical feedback so far, and could really use some more
collaborators going forward.

We've already had redditor and professional motion graphics designer
juicestain [contribute an awesome animated
intro](http://www.juicestain.com/?p=249) for the interviews. We still
need sound design for the intro, and work with us on other graphic
elements. We also need redditors to shoot interviews that wouldn't be
feasible for one of us to do. We have had to say no to some awesome
interview opportunities because we just couldn't get to the city where
it was going down. Next time, we'd love to be able to call on one of
you to help take advantage of that opportunity. We have some exciting
interviews lined up with outstanding people you've heard of, but we
also want to starting having reddit interview non-famous, but equally
interesting people (a local traffic cop, a grunt in the netflix
shipping facility, a minor league baseball player, etc.) and we need
your help to do that. We don't have budgets right now, but we can
offer credits, shout outs, links, references, and character witnesses
at pending trials for any collaborators. Let us know about your skillz
[here](https://leaptec.wufoo.com/forms/reddit-creators/) or just
subscribe to [r/redditvideos](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditvideos) and keep an eye
out for stuff in your area or field of expertise (you'll also get to
see amazing behind the scenes gems like
[this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLAdY6I2bTo)).

1272432071.0	bx32e	For those of you who know football is played with a round ball: reddit &amp; Intelligence Squared collaborate on a debate about the state of football/soccer today	hueypriest	97	102	112	"*Money, violence &amp; cheats: is this what football comes down to today?*

[Intelligence Squared](http://www.intelligencesquared.com), London's top debating forum, are hosting a football debate at 18:45 (UK-time) on Thursday 29 April and the top questions from this thread will be asked to the panel.  

Speaking for the motion are the sports journalists Tom Bower, Dominic Lawson and Ed Smith and arguing against the motion are the ex-professional football Garth Crooks, Wayne Rooney's ghost writer Hunter Davies and former chairman of the English Football League David Sheepshanks.  Angus Scott, a presenter on Al Jazeera Sport, is chairing the debate.

Is the World Cup the greatest event in the sporting calendar or will it just be an orgy of WAGs and hooliganism? Do fans find meaning and fellowship on the terraces or are they just being exploited by global brands and dodgy billionaires?  Is the sport itself uniquely aesthetically pleasing or is it stagnant and dull?  The speakers will be giving their points of view and this is your opportunity to tackle them on the crucial issues.  

The event will be live-streamed on [www.intelligencesquared.com/live](http://www.intelligencesquared.com/live) and will also be available on iPhones at [http://mobile.livestation.com](http://mobile.livestation.com).  Watch and have your say through comments below.  

For the second consecutive event, Intelligence Squared invites reddit users to kick-start the discussion. This thread will be open for questions until 18.00 UK-time on Thursday 29 April. The questions which receive the most votes in this thread will be posed directly to our panel, and included in the live event, which will be livestreamed online then available on-demand on [Youtube](http://mobile.livestation.com) and [iTunes](http://www.itunes.com/podcast?id=350343972).   

So it's over to you - Ask them anything!

Notes: 
[""best"" comment sorting](http://blog.reddit.com/2009/10/reddits-new-comment-sorting-system.html) will be used to determine the top questions.
