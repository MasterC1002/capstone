[Ballotpedia Link](http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Florida_2012_ballot_measures)

Nothing against religion or those who practice whatever it is they may practice but these moves are going to strengthen the power of the extreme right wing and religious fundamentalist like Terry Jones and to give more funding to the already wealthy beyond our dreams megachurches and it needs to be stopped, especially in the case of where the politicians will have more power over the judges of the state supreme court while unseating three of the more moderate voices in that court, it is nothing more than a ill disguised power grab. 

The amendments on each election are normally the hardest to deal with, half the time once we vote for the big guys like president and governor we want to get out of there and don't worry about the giant wall of legaleese text that often accompany these amendment's but please for our futures sake read up on them and vote informed and spread the word. 

**Edit:** Don't get me wrong either but there are a common sense Amendments on the ballot as well such as 2, (Disabled Vets tax exemption) 9 (War and First responder widows tax exemption), and 11 (Low income seniors tax relief) so voting no across the board may not be the best thing but this is personal perspective, as a veteran I support just about anything that would help out those that lost limbs or loved ones in these wars, but that's just me.

Long story short, my mom was all set to move a month and a half ago and had a heart attack. While she was in the hospital the apartment fell through and her former landlord-- a real dickfuck of a human being-- immediately initiated eviction proceedings. She was woken up this morning by the police, escorted from the apartment, and forced to watch as all of her belongins were unceremoniously ousted to the curb. Add to that the fact that they wouldn't even let her retrieve our cat, and she currently has no idea where he is. She is a wreck, and I am trying every available option.

If anyone can help at least procure a place for her to store her things I would be unduly grateful. Money isn't an issue, it is just the means-- she isn't even supposed to lift boxes for another two weeks.

Cheers to Reddit Miracles,

1347830974.0	zzm3h	ATTN: Florida Artists.  Would you like to design a potential FL license?	vetplatesfl	42	3	5	"Floridians,

I'm working with my good friend who is a Captain in the U.S. Army.  Here is his e-mail to me that will explain the purpose of this post.

""Do you know any computer artists that would like to get their name out?

I've been in contact with a state legislator and he is willing to assist me in drafting legislation authorizing the State of Florida to issue specialty license plates to Veterans awarded a combat medal (Bronze Star, Silver Star, Distinguished Service Cross, Navy Cross, Distinguished Flying Cross). The Medal of Honor and Purple Heart already have a plate, but the others in parenthesis do not.

The catch is, I have to provide designs for these plates. I personally have little artistic talent, and I do not have a computer set up that would produce the professional quality designs needed to go before the State Legislature. I would be willing to show them the laws regarding these plates and also include their name in the submission to the legislator. 

I will not be able to compensate them, but I will give them a reference letter on my official letterhead and request a letter from the legislator in appreciation.

If you know someone that might be interested, please let me know. Just give them this email.

I hope to make these long over-due plates honoring the combat service of our Veterans a reality.""

Work on this project have just started.  There are no immediate deadlines right now.
Here is a list of 2011 specialty licenses in FL: http://www.flhsmv.gov/html/tagbrochure.pdf

Please send me a private message if you wish to volunteer.  Include some of your work in the private message.  We would love as many Florida volunteers/entries as possible.

If you aren't an artist yourself, but know of one, please forward them this link.

EDIT: http://www3.flhsmv.gov/DMV/Proc/RS/RS-20.pdf
 I wanted to update this thread with Florida's procedure and specifications for new specialty plates.  If you are an artist you want to pay attention to the last two pages of the pdf file which gives you the format.  However, it is interesting to note that not all specialty plates follow these standards.  I think some plates receive special considerations."	t5_2qh7q	True

*To anyone who has lived/lives in Oviedo PLEASE READ THIS!

* In 2004, over 60 percent of Seminole County voters said no to developing the Black Hammock and our rural areas. 


* On February 26th, the developer InDev Inc is attempting to bypass the people's vote and ask the Seminole County Commission to allow development into the very areas we want to preserve. 

* Please contact Commissioner John Horgan at jspry02@seminolecountyfl.gov and Commissioner Brenda Carey at stucker@seminolecountyfl.gov and tell them to vote NO on allowing InDev to build in our rural areas. 

Seminole County does not need to turn into one huge concrete block and we certainly don't need developers circumventing the voters. Help protect Florida and email the Commissioners today.*

Just a couple thousand votes could shift the entire nomination. Go to your local County Supervisor of Elections office before Jan 3rd and change your party to Republican (bear with me).  While you're there, sign up for an absentee ballot for the January 31st Republican Presidential Preference Primary.  When you receive the ballot, send it back with a vote for Ron Paul.  

Go back into the elections office at some point and change your party back to independent, democrat, or whatever.  

You've now just shaken up the entire election.  

edit - This is less of an endorsement of Ron Paul and more of a push to have real issues presented during the campaign.  Instead of GOP talking points and dirty politics we could have debates about limiting our military operations and ending human rights violations.  Love him or hate him, Paul is the only one bringing up these issues.  "	t5_2qh7q	True

I went to renew my driver’s license the other day.

Gone are the convenient days of the office in Eastpoint (even though one of the “official” Florida web­sites still lists that office as OPEN and operational!).

Another “official” site says the Crawfordville office is closed on Monday. Yet another “official” website lists the incorrect phone number for the Crawford­ville office — the closest alternative for folks in our Franklin County area.

(When I called that incorrect num­ber for information, the gentle man who answered demonstrated great tolerance and patience while advising me his was not the number I wanted after all. Cour­tesy still lives in some places.) I finally found the correct number and called to see if it was more convenient for the staff and for me to make a time­ sensitive appointment for service, since I planned to stop on my way to a medical appointment in Tallahassee. (That pre­caution proved unnecessary, the service line was short and the service was effi­cient and prompt.) However, even the location proved chal­lenging to find within the county complex: a small, temporary paper sign on one door of the tax collector’s office was all that identified the important site.

Have you seen or reviewed the newest legislative requirements to secure a driv­er’s license?

I have been married for a little over 50 years and three months. I have bought numerous houses, paid many mortgages, owned other properties, held important and responsible jobs in several states, owned and operated a successful busi­ness with dozens of employees, had chil­dren, voted regularly and served in sever­al responsible political offices. This is the first time that I was ever required to pro­vide my certified marriage certificate.

Had I been married more than once, I would have been obligated to provide cer­tified copies of any and all name changes. (I suspect that makes it even more desir­able for a marrying woman to keep her maiden name through whatever matches she may make.) Because our house mail is delivered to a post office box, I was almost unable to prove my street address of residence in my own name. (The directions on the license application information clearly state “not post office box.”) Although we own our home in Carrabelle, the deed identifies it by the lot number in our sub­division, not by street address. Some of our Florida utility and other services are listed in my husband’s name, so I was faced with the dual challenge of provid­ing verification of a street address and that, indeed, I truly lived at that address.

Numerous personal questions were asked as part of the license application process, including, “Are you addicted to drugs or alcohol?” Would people who are truly addicted ever acknowledge that sad reality when applying for a driver’s license? I wonder.

All the questions had to be answered, with no option for refusal. “No answer, no license” the clerk warned.

My husband had renewed his Florida license online late last summer. That con­venient option is available only in some cases and was not available to me. And, if he were to carelessly lose his license, we were told that he would have to go through the entire process (providing all documentation) as I did today to get a replacement — even though his license is valid and current.

Fortunately, I had already purchased a passport and a certified copy of my birth certificate, both costly documents to obtain. To obtain this driver’s license, I paid an additional $48 for the certi­fied marriage license and nearly $20 in today’s gasoline money for the 71.4-mile round trip to the “un-local” governmental office. The new driver’s license itself cost $54, which does not include the costs of purchasing the additional documentation. The new license has a gold star in the upper right-hand corner. This costly, but newly necessary verification, now ensures my driving privileges. This license also can be used as a required photo ID when I choose to exercise my right to vote .

The same day’s news said the nonparti­san, public policy Brennan Center for Jus­tice at New York University’s School of Law found that, of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the 2012 presidential elec­tion, 70 percent will now come from the states with new restrictive voting laws.

It used to be “free” for me to vote in any election. Today’s legislators in Florida (and elsewhere) have certainly changed that.

A Meetup for all Florida redditors to go to Hard Knocks orlando

Once we have a basic head count I will call them to see if its possible to reserve the place for this event if not there are group discounts anyways

We need to also agree on the best possible date

I think it would be ideal if we could come as different teams representing our cities (or nearby cities) 

we would all end up meeting tons of new people It would be tons of fun

So what do you think? I know there are a bunch of people in orlando that would like to attend and there are a bunch of people down here in miami. 

Also if you guys like the team ideas it would be best to assign an organizer to each city to help make arrangements (I know depending on the amount of people interested in miami we might try to arrange renting a bus)

EDIT: How does memorial day weekend sound? for those of you who will be making the trip and staying in orlando May 28-30th

EDIT 2: If one person from each area could help organize that area that would be very helpful (PM me if you are interested in the position for your respective city/county)

Also what would be the best method of arranging this properly? A facebook event?

And I still need suggestions for the dates, I will be calling hard knocks to see what dates are best for them (possibly reserving the location to ourselves) 

Thanks for being so interested guys, I'm sure this will be an amazing meetup once we get it all arranged."	t5_2qh7q	True

1339979352.0	v77yu	Florida redditors, can you help me figure out the name of a cool plant I saw while vacationing on the gulf coast a few years ago?	DevonianAge	26	1	17	"A few years ago, while on vacation, I saw a really cool plant growing up the trunk of a palm tree on the gulf coast.  I've searched around the internet for a photograph of the plant from time to time since then, with no success.  But this year I became a redditor, and it just now occurred to me that I can ask you!  

It was around June, three years ago.  Unfortunately, I didn't take a picture when I was there, so here comes my best verbal description:

By day, this plant looks like a gnarly, forbidding tangle of vines/ aerial roots.  Like I said, I saw it growing up a tall tree-- I'm 90% sure it was a palm tree.  it was not particularly interesting by day.  It had that vaguely carnivorous, prehistoric look common to a lot of Florida plants.  I don't recall seeing any leaves at all, though I'm sure it must have had some.

By night, large white blooms opened up, striking and luminous in the dark.  The blooms were similar to lotus flowers or dahlias- many tightly packed petals, symmetrically radiating out from the center.  They did NOT look anything at all like morning glories (the flower type that comes up most often in searches for night-blooming vines).  

The plant was in a well-to-do, nicely maintained, older neighborhood on the gulf coast, so I don't know whether it's native to the area or not.

That's all I can remember.  It seems like it should be enough to get somewhere, but I've been trying to figure this out for three years, with no luck at all.  I sincerely appreciate any clues!

---


Edit:  Wow, guys, thanks so much for the identification!  You guys nailed it: it is definitely the night-blooming Cereus.  I really appreciate the pictures and the positive feedback.  And now, if I forget to buy a field guide before my next trip to Florida, I know who to call...  you're awesome!"	t5_2qh7q	True

[x-post /r/soccer]	The_Panda_Bear	34	13	13	"Someone on my previous [submission](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1dkxya/please_help_my_local_club_orlando_city_sc_pass_a/?sort=top) suggested that I should try here as well. 

PLEASE HELP US GET BILL #1828 PASSED THIS WEEK!
As we head into the end of the legislative session, we need your help. The push to bring MLS to Orlando has been attached to a new bill #1828.

Here's what you can do to help: Please call and email House Speaker Will Weatherford, and tell him, ""I'm in support of Bill #1828 that will bring Major League Soccer to Orlando. I urge you to pass this bill.""

House Speaker Will Weatherford: will.weatherford@myfloridahouse.gov

I know it's asking a lot especially when we are such a small club in Orlando, FL. But it really would mean a lot to my city.

Thank you to those that help or at least upvoted this post to have it get more exposure.
Also, if you feel that this is considered spam then please downvote accordingly.

**edit**: We are bitterly disappointed that House Bill #7127 reached in impasse in the House of Representatives today. We will continue to work towards our goal of bringing MLS to Orlando. 

THANK YOU so much to those of you that helped out."	t5_2qh7q	True

The GOP dominated government in Tallahassee is spending millions of tax payer money to litigate their way out of carrying out that mandate. Soon there will be public hearings about the proposed redistricting. You can be sure that no matter what happens at the local meetings these dirtbags will go back to Tallahassee and do what they want and try to call it the ""public will.""

1349909999.0	11a0me	I am a Howl-o-Scream scary person, AMAA	HoS_guy	36	17	24	"I will not be answering anything that might reveal my identity, nor will I be revealing anything behind-the-scenes as far as sets go (No ""This hallway goes here, you can get through this way as a shortcut, etc"" type things).

I will start off with some Do's and Don'ts if you go to HoS or really any haunted house event, probably to be amended as I think of more things:

Don't break the illusion.  You may think that the houses or whatever are stupid, in which case I question why you come, but others do not and do not appreciate having the experience spoiled.  This includes loudly pointing and calling out ""there's one right here!""  If you are with someone that wants you to point it out *to them*, do so subtly.

Do point us to people; we love that!  If you want someone to be targeted, give us their name, and indicate clearly who they are.  Now, that can mean a few different things, but if you say ""the girl behind me"" and there are like 5, it's hit or miss.  If you just point at a group, we'll just ignore you and scare normally.  It's probably going to be dark and we have to be constantly moving and scanning, so the more clear you are, the better chance we have of seeing you.

Don't grab or hit things.  I swear this should not need to be stated, but there you have it.  This includes things that you think are completely static, because you do not know if there is a person nearby that may be injured by your asshattery.  If someone is injured due to your being obnoxious, we WILL through your ass out.

Do be aware of the people around you.  If there is a group of people being overactive, drunk, and not into the feel of things, they spoil the experience of those around them, and what's more, they make scarers very leery of getting in their way or interacting with them at all, because we might get hit.  If there is a group of frat boys or something, and they go through a house or other area being loud and obnoxious, some scarers may just back off completely out of fear of getting hit, not to mention the absolute demoralizing effect of being essentially told ""your hard work and dedication to this job means nothing, we think you are worthless.""  So be aware of these groups, and keep plenty of distance.  I would go so far as to get out of line and go to another house if some get in line behind you.

Don't sing as a group.  Dear sweet fucking Jesus, every single person in a house, zone, or food place wants to curb stomp every single one of you, and fantasizes about the house becoming real just for you, and seeing you be tortured in the most horrific way possible.  You are not being clever, and you are not showing camaraderie, you are being an absolute asshole to everyone around you, employees and guests.

Do interact with us!  It's not often we get to actually do this; it's a matter of the time we have to interact, which is very little.  But sometimes if we are in the same place for a few extra seconds or more, we might crack a joke (all firmly in character), make a reference, or most usually, just single you out for special attention for any of a few different reasons.  Talk back to us!  Just don't *challenge* what we're saying.  If a zombie says he/she's going to eat your brains and you go up to them and say confrontationally ""do it!,"" they're not going to fucking do it.  They're going to roll their eyes mentally and move to the next scare.  See point one about breaking the illusion.

Do have fun and react naturally.  If your natural reaction is never to be scared, that, believe it or not, is ok.  We are still going to try.  If your reaction is to laugh and be ""mock-scared,"" that's ok too, though both will lower you on the priority list of scare targets.  If your reaction is to be absolutely terrified and scream, well....that's why we work here &gt;:-)

Do not try to get anyone to talk out of character.  We do not break character unless something so major happens that the house or area shuts down.  Do not get pissy when we stay in character.  If you have a question that is burning you and we have the freedom of movement and/or time, we will try to get you an answer, but we will stay in character.  This means that you have to pay extra special attention to how we move.  If a zombie is ambling about, and you ask him something, and he suddenly starts ambling in a straight line, you should probably follow him.  But he's NOT going to straighten up, lose his zombie voice, and direct you to the nearest bathroom.

Kids.  Oh fucking Hell, kids.  OK, so here's the deal.  HoS is for adults.  There is alcohol, borderline language, and sexual innuendo, not to mention the TERRIFYING NATURE of what it, you know, IS.  Deal with these facts and accept that they will not change for you.  That said, bring your kids if you as a parent think they can handle it; that's your call, and one I am in no way asking you not to make.  But make it, and be prepared for the possibility you might be wrong.  They are guests just like everyone else and we scare them, assuming that's what they want, just like everyone else.  No harm will come to them, so your cries of ""I'm protecting my child!"" make us laugh at you.  If a small child below about 6 is convulsing in terror, there's honestly not much point in scaring them more, so we probably won't bother, but some do go for the highest height of terror they can, and it's even money whether they get a smile or frown from their boss, and it never gets further than a facial expression, so get off your high horse.

That's all for now, but AMAA

Now I have been to Florida as a kid a few times (23 now) but I obviously don't remember everything and things probably changed.

1. I haven't booked a hotel or motel anywhere as we plan on traveling by car and most likely won't spend more than 2 nights anywhere. I'm under the impression that finding vacancy will not be a problem throughout Florida. Correct?

2. Unlike companies in Russia I understand that most places like hotels prefer credit cards. Now I have one but since my account is denominated in roubles all transactions will be converted with a shitty exchange rate. Can I pay in cash or is it really just that much easier to pay with plastic? Will everyone think I am a drug dealer if I pay with $100 bills?

3. Advice about places to see? Obviously will go to Disney/universal studios because I am a dead man if we don't. Remember going to some safari place place and alligator place, stuff like that.

It wasn't until my wife and I discussed plans for having children that the news of the sweeping changes the government is bringing upon the state started to really disturb me.  Do I really want my kids attending an already heavily flawed education system with opposed goals that is predicted to undergo so many budget cuts?  Living here without a family was one thing -- I was even flexible enough to deal with the sour economy of recent years -- but the thought of the future of my kids being impacted by the politics really made me stop to think if it wouldn't be better to pack up and take the family elsewhere for their well being.

BreakfastWStrangers	24	6	4	"My partner Courtney and I want to take you and our fellow Americans out for breakfast for part of a book we're writing: 'Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America'.

* [Breakfast with Strangers website](http://breakfastwithstrangers.com) 
* [Our video for the project](http://vimeo.com/43216845) 

If you are interested then please email us at breakfastwithstrangers@gmail.com and let us know in 500 words or less why you'd be the awesome breakfast interview as we travel across the USA for 5 months this summer. We posted a few months ago our beta version and had a ton of great responses from the Reddit community. We will be in Florida in the fall and looking to find great people now. Again, please email us so that we have an easy record to add to our state=by-state spreadsheet. We're trying our best to keep track of folks.

**The Details &amp; Route**

On July 18, 2012 we’ll hit the road from Portland, OR bound for Portland, ME and all places in between. Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, we’ll blend old-fashioned and contemporary connection as we seek out strangers in a variety of ways: bulletin boards, classifieds, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, CouchSurfing, pure chance, and more. We’ll build community and engage local media outlets along the way.

**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, learning what our new friends think about life’s big and little questions. We’ll chronicle these conversations in our blog so that strangers can meet strangers—virtually. Our project will foster connection, conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America.

**The Conversation:**

This journey is a conversation. We’ll skip the small talk and ask the big questions, but our hope is that the conversation will continue long after the breakfast dishes are cleared. How? We’ll start here and see where it ripples out:

* www.breakfastwithstrangers.com
* www.facebook.com/BreakfastWithStrangers
* www.twitter.com/#!/BWS50Meals

**The Outcome:**

At the end of our trip we’ll select 50 breakfasts to highlight in our book, Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America. We will donate 10 percent of the book’s proceeds to Servas US, a non-profit organization promoting peace through travel and relationship-building.

The most important outcome of all: the reminder that we are all part of a larger community.
Thanks for your consideration,

**Matt &amp; Courtney**

I noticed off in the distance a good sized bright orange light. No pulsing, no sound, but it was REALLY BRIGHT.

Where we live in Palm Beach County is right in line with the landing runways for West Palm Airport, so we constantly have planes flying over our house. This was different though. It was really odd. I noticed the object was a little south of where planes normally approach and because it was so bright I couldn't really take my eye off it. It just seemed really odd. So as we're sitting there talking and I'm staring at this thing I point it out to her and said ""I don't know what the hell this is but it's weird."" 

For the next 5 minutes or so we stare at this thing move west to southwest VERY SLOWLY. Finally when it gets to the SW direction of the horizon it stops for about 2 minutes and slowly starts to pulse. After that happens it seems like it turns directly SW and pulses and dims and fades away. I stayed outside for about 10 minutes but whatever it was it didn't come back. 

Mind you last night was a perfect clear sky. There was almost no light pollution and no clouds. Now what's even stranger earlier in the day I was unloading our car before we went to the car dealership I saw an F-18 fighter, not flying West to East to land, but East to West right over our house. The only reason I noticed that was because the engine noise made me look up.

Now I'm not a tin foil hat person but seriously this was one of the strangest things I have ever seen in the sky.

TLDR; Weird orange light last night in sky

I'm really torn between a few places - Homosassa Springs, the Sarasota area, Naples, and over in Orlando, only because those are the areas that I know and with the exception of Orlando, are fairly safe.

Does anyone have any recommendations for other safe-ish places in Florida? or tips on how to decide which area to really look into? Literally taking any suggestions at this point. Trying to to get out there by November, so I have time to really figure this out right now. Super sorry if I'm totally posting this in the wrong area. I don't post much on reddit. D:

Thanks!

**Edit:** Since I was asked for some more information and even though the comment chain isn't long, I figured I would throw this up here anyway - I'm in my early 20's, just graduated college with a liberal arts degree (because I suck and didn't know what I wanted to do until after I graduated of course) with a possibility of transferring to another location with the same company I work with down in Naples. I'm also a former Disney College Program participant so I have the opportunity to be re-hired over at WDW. Currently those are my two job options that I know can be set in stone.

I'm the kind of person who's willing to do anything once, but I'm definitely a foodie, love the beach, and can definitely appreciate some time at a museum. I'm also a theme park junkie, which would make Orlando perfect in that aspect, but the safety aspect is what bothers me for that area.

I would be renting wherever I would go and have a friend who has the ability to transfer their job to any of those areas as well. Not the biggest selling point for any place and not opposed to any other suggestions, it's just highly convenient. I'm looking for a place around $800 (obviously cheaper is better, but that's hard to come by.)"	t5_2qh7q	True

Can anyone give us some advice on nice places that aren't too pricey that we could look into moving? We currently live in NJ where a very crappy 1 bedroom apartment runs about $1100/mo without any utilities included. I would prefer the place we move to be a bit cheaper than that if possible.

As for our lifestyle, we sort of keep to ourselves for the most part. We enjoy going to the beach/pool from time to time, cafes and places for dinner or lunch, and parks/natural locations are always a plus for us. We aren't so 'outdoorsey' that we need to be secluded from things; nor are we into the night life or bar hopping scene.

Any suggestions here would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!"	t5_2qh7q	True

For years, they've been managing a colony of about 80 cats at [Saddle Creek Park](http://www.polk-county.net/subpage.aspx?menu_id=52&amp;nav=res&amp;id=4594). This year, they received several large grants which got them [some notice](http://www.theledger.com/article/20110811/NEWS/110819894). 

Unfortunately, folks that think feral cats should be euthanized also noticed and have been pressuring the county to eliminate the colony at Saddle Creek. The local paper has published several articles supporting this view-

[Fur Flies Over Group's Feeding of Colony of Cats](http://www.theledger.com/article/20111120/NEWS/111129960) 

[Groups Clash Over 'Trap-Neuter-Release' Effectiveness](http://www.theledger.com/article/20111120/NEWS/111129957)

[County Commissioners Support Removing Cats From Saddle Creek](http://www.theledger.com/article/20111202/NEWS/111209879)

The local TV affiliates have been more supportive of Feral Fanciers- [Fox](http://www.myfoxtampabay.com/dpp/news/local/polk/saddlecreek-park-cats-112111), [CBS](http://lakeland.wtsp.com/news/news/94189-polk-county-officials-and-local-non-profit-odds-over-cats),  [ABC](http://www.abcactionnews.com/dpp/news/region_polk/cat-rescue-given-two-weeks-to-find-new-home-for-80-cats-living-in-park) and [NBC](http://www2.tbo.com/news/2011/dec/06/compromise-sought-for-feral-cat-colony-i-51672-vi-25280/).

Feral Fanciers presented the county board with a 77 page proposal to manage the colony humanely ([article](http://www.theledger.com/article/20111206/NEWS/111209511/1134)). But the county has responded that they are going to go ahead and [destroy the colony](http://feralfanciers.org/News.html).

Frankly, we're at wits' end. Feral Fanciers raised money, recruited volunteers and was actively managing the colony, but our Republican dominated county board decided to spend taxpayers' money to destroy the colony instead. It's mind boggling.

We're hoping some of you have any ideas or can help at all. Thank you.

There are a good number of Floridians from other places also. It is great to have an opportunity to meet more area redditors without leaving your house and perhaps later even in person. We would be very pleased to have some more people join in with us. The people are cool there and many topics are discussed, so even if you don't want to meet up it is a great place to be.


Please check them out by clicking here sometime and join in the fun:

(x/post from r/Tampa)		21	6	5	"My dad lives in Brooksville, and his two calico cats busted out a screen on his window and escaped on Wednesday night. They're very friendly, but not to each other, so it's likely they would not be together. I only have a picture of one, [here she is](http://i.imgur.com/w185R.jpg) , she answers to Paris. The other one is the classic tri-color calico and answers to Florence. He's alerted the local humane societies and been calling every day, with no luck so far. We're hoping that since they're friendly someone picked them up knowing that they were pets. I don't know what the collar and tag situation was, he just asked me for internet help. Anyway, if you know anything or anyone, or have any ideas about other people we could call, we would really appreciate any help.

1313616096.0	jm0wy	Visiting Florida, a little advice please?	Lolworth	16	2	41	"Hello!

I'm from the UK (London) and visiting Florida in October. I'll be over there with work and looking to tack on a little holiday - sorry, *vacation* whilst I'm there :)

I'd love some advice on the following topics if you please, and anything else you think is worth mentioning would be warmly recieved!

* What's the temperature like in October? For perspective it's about 15-20 degrees C in the UK at the moment and we consider that to be warm, no-jacket weather.

* Cost is key. I'd rather pay very little to stay there and be able to enjoy myself than pay for a swanky hotel. Hotels around Orlando are listed on Hotwire.com for as little as $18-$20 a night in the Kissimmee area and around the ""Disney Main Gate"" - is there any reason you wouldn't take those? How would one travel from these places to the city centre, is there a bus/tube/train system?

* What cities are there in Florida that are good sized, world cities (if any)... Florida, Miami? I'm very much a city kinda guy, where would you go?

* I have an idea of starting my trip in Orlando, driving to Miami and staying there for a bit before flying back. Is this sensible? How much would renting a car cost and can you pick one up in one place and drop off in another? I can drive, have a UK/EU license (though am used to manual transmission). Or should I just get on some sort of train/bus?

* The 'Parks' - Disney, Seaworld, Busch Gardens - are these worth a visit? How much should I set aside for any of these? Anything else worth mentioning

* What's just plain cool about Florida?

Sorry for the broad questions. I've never visited the US in my life though you see so much of it over here in the media that I've always wanted to. If I can possibly return the favour by way of some London tips I'd be glad to help!

Cheers! :)"	t5_2qh7q	True

1309677008.0	ifinj	Help save a great bar in Gainesville!	sfitsea	18	4	3	"So you may or may not have been to Brophy's Irish pub in Downtown Gainesville. If you have, you know that it's unique for the lack of smoking, as well as the great booths that are really comfortable. You probably also know that the owner, Paul, is one of the friendliest men you'll ever meet. After surviving a brain tumor and selling off his last, hugely successful bar (the Shamrock), he has opened this gem in the downtown area. 

Unfortunately, the bar, like many others in that area, have been facing tough times. Since it's not a place that puts up with the shit that Grog/ :08, etc all do, he doesn't have the easy income provided by the mainstream student population. All the same, Paul is willing to accommodate almost anybody, so long as they are respectful and mindful of his property. 

With that in mind, why not help the guy out and check em out? You'd be helping to preserve one of the best hidden gems that Gainesville has to offer.

Brophy's is the bar that is built into the downtown parking garage, and is right across from the old Market Street (another gem that has faded recently)."	t5_2qh7q	True

We work in Largo, Florida, oddly enough across the street from an Animal Shelter but they're full and can't take her. We can't keep her as we already have two very territorial cats, and we don't have the money to pay for gas to take her to another shelter, that may end up being full as well. If anyone or anyone you know can help by caring for her, or taking her to a shelter I'd really really appreciate it. If we can't find anyone to take her or help, my sister goes with friends to a shelter on saturdays, so she might be able to take her then, but no sooner.

[Here are the pictures (there's two)](http://imgur.com/v7JBdJL,5QtLVMV#0) They're not exactly high-quality, just took them with my dads cellphone, but she's very cute.

She (I'm pretty sure it's a she anyhow) is very sweet, walked right into our machine shop and will even follow us, but very malnourished and I can feel her bones when I pet her. We've given her what cat food we could spare and some water, and we're letting her sleep here as it's been raining lately. If anyone is at all interested in helping just leave a post here or message me, we'd appreciate it very much.
