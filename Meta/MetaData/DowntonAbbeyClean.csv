I've had walking pneumonia so a little extra time was just lyin' around. It was cathartic to say the least. I've been a fan of the Masterpiece series for at least ten years and it leaves me wondering why isn't more television held to these standards. The ratio of worthy writing v. crap is off kilter. 

Anyway, what a friggin' crazy time this was! I'm a big, tall bear-of-a-man, and I was sniffling and blubbering. In keeping with parlance, I'm sure I looked a fright. So many nicely constructed characters were perfectly placed in the most beautiful scenery. Ugh, I'm sorry this is all choppy. I just saw the S3 finale...yeah. 

I loved how many small decisions had huge ramifications.

1361830291.0	197ul8	I'm loving how the Downton guys catch shit for wearing tuxedos.	turkeypants	126	11	14	"I'm rewatching all the episodes and am having a fun time with the little disparaging digs people keep taking at the guys when they wear black tie and dinner jackets (tuxedos) instead of white tie and tails. For me, a tuxedo is the fanciest thing anybody I know ever wears, reserved for the fanciest occasions, yet it's treated so disdainfully on the show, to hilarious effect, since it was still an emerging style and Yorkshire was so far away from the center of modernity in London.

In S3E1, they're at dinner and the American grandma is talking about how her home of Newport is no jungle but is a bit less formal than Downton/England. Matthew is wearing his dinner jacket because Tall Alfred ruined his tailcoat because Bad Thomas tricked him into cleaning it with something that burned it. The dowager countess responds, ""Well Mathhew obviously wants you to feel at home in his playclothes.""

HA!

And then later prior to another dinner, the American grandma walks in to the room where people are gathering and sees Robert and Matthew in their tuxes and says, ""Ooh, you two are dressed for a barbecue!""

HA!

Later when they learn the oven has broken downstairs and there will be no food, and the American grandma takes over and announces they'll have an indoor picnic, the dowager countess is exasperated and says, ""Do you think I might have a drink,"" as she puts a hand out to grasp Robert's lapel, and then says, ""Oh I'm so sorry, I thought you were a waiter.""

HA!

Wonderful. It was good fun but I did have to go read about the evolution of formal dress to fully appreciate it:

I understand with Dan Stevens leaving that the writers needed to come up with some way for Mathew Crawley to leave in a quick and easily explained manner. I have no problem with how he died. However, it seems a bit like a cop out to have two deaths in one season that happen on the day one becomes a parent. It really felt like bad writing. 
When Sybil died I bawled. Full out, arms around my knees, sobbing loudly. I was glad to be home alone. I was completely into the scene, I was no longer in my apartment.
When Mathew died, I saw it the moment they showed him speeding home. From that moment I felt anger. I could see that there was less than two minutes left of showtime meaning that there would be no journey for me as the voyeur. It was a cheap hook to have on the edge of our seats until next season. I really feel like rather than going on and on in Scotland they should have given us 10 minutes of some sort of closure. Something more than his body, bloody in a ditch. 
Ugh. 
So for next season, we know that they have a boy. The line is secure pending any new drama lines that will suddenly reveal otherwise. There are two widow/ers in the house now with young children. Tom will probably be in charge of the modern changes that Mathew had in mind. This could cause the writers to be tempted in pairing Mary and Tom off. Frankly I would rather see them stay widow/ers for a while. They lost the love of their lives, it would cheapen their romances if they quickly moved on. 
Anyway, I just finished the episode no more than 10 minutes ago and had so much pent up thought I had to explode somewhere. "	t5_2seky	True

Try The Forsyte Saga	iheartgawker	62	3	25	"If you're like me and dying for more historical shows while waiting for Downton, I highly recommend The Forsyte Saga. There's one that was made in the 1960's by the BBC that's a 26 part series, but I watched the 10 part series made in 2001. It stars Damien Lewis, Rupert Graves and Ioan Gruffudd, among others. It is based on Pulitzer Prize winning novels and really explores issues like classism, rules regarding marriage, and how the upper classes dealt with the dimming of the British Empire. Frankly I think they dealt with some of these issues better than Downton. 

I just finished the series and am blown away at the character development and period ""realness."" The series deals with heavier topics than Downton and isn't quite as witty (sadly Maggie Smith can't be in everything). But the characters are incredibly well done, the acting superb, costumes fantastic, and you really get to know these characters and families since the series goes from ~1860 - ~1930. The makeup department outdid themselves in aging the characters. 

Anyways, wanted to share since I had a fantastic time watching it and think most Downton/historical fiction fans would as well. They're all available on Netflix streaming!"	t5_2seky	True

I've read a few articles but I am confused whether it was Dan Steven's *own* decision to leave Downton or if Matthew's fate was already destined. I'm curious because I want to know if I should be angry at Dan Stevens or Julian Fellows. 

If it was by Dan's own virtue to leave, I as a viewer am completely agitated. I understand, Broadway, starring in different movies and all that jazz... However, would it have *killed* him to stay aboard and maybe not appear in a few episodes? I'm not sure about you guys, but Sybil's death is still fresh in my mind [thankful for shirtless Branson :)] and now there's Matthew to deal with? In all honesty, half of the reason why I watched this show was because of the Mary/Matthew relationship [and Sybil but...] and even Matthew as a character because he had his witty moments and bumbling-ness that was entertaining. But to think that he could just wittle away all of his work because he was maybe getting tired of DA or something just makes me sad that he wouldn't think of owing it to the viewers that pined for his character &amp; Mary to get together. If this was the case, then he should've stayed with Lavinia and saved me the party I threw of her death! Granted, he doesn't *owe* it to the viewers however I would think he would have SOME appreciation for the die-hard Team Servants.

/end of rant. It's *not* what Sybil would've wanted. 

**tl;dr** what the frig, man?

They have all ""changed jobs"" but haven't really grown as people.  

O'Brien and Thomas are still at their petty games, even though one caused the death of a fetus and the other saw the horrors of war. Mary's intentions have improved but she's still rather catty and doesn't support Edith.  Sibyl was always the wild free thinker.  Edith is still the Eyore of the series.

Daisy started out as a scared dummy.  Her relationship with William was her confusing adolescent first love, with Mrs. Patmore's help she learned about the nature of love and was able to forgive herself.  Her resulting relationship with William's dad has greatly improved her self esteem and she's trying out her newfound powers on the footmen, even though jealousy is kind of dominating her actions. 

I'm really excited for her new opportunity on the farm.  Season 1 Daisy would never consider herself capable of improving her station, but Season 4 empowered Daisy could.  I hope they show her making the jump away from Downton's cloistered politics."	t5_2seky	True

FireUptheQuattro	40	5	11	"So while I'm fairly excited to see the beginnings of the Cora/Robert romance, the thought did occur that we also may be able to see earlier versions of some other fan favorites.  The Dowager Countess is an obvious one.  Young Bates could be interesting (wasn't he drunk, angry and taking the fall for his wife around this period?).  I'm guessing Carson is probably too old for us to see his days as an actor, but maybe it could fit in with the timeline?

I'm not sure how I feel about Violet making Clarkson lie/skew the facts about Sybil's chances of life had the necessary medical steps been taken. On the one hand I realize that the what if's don't do anyone any good, and that Cora and Robert need to move on from this any way they can but on the other hand I feel like it was a harsh but needed awakening for Robert to realize that titles and knighthoods are not as important as experience. No matter what, I'm glad that they seem to be healing now.

I'm very happy to see Mary and the others backing up Tom. I want him and baby Sybil to stay apart of the show, and I think there is a good chance of that happening if he feels he has a place in Downton that is not sacrificing his heritage. This is another place that Robert (and Carson) are doing more harm than good in their never ending quest to preserve traditions and the status quo. 

I feel bad for Ethel, and I appreciate her storyline more this episode than I have the whole rest of the season. I was happy that Cora stood up to Robert, and Violet made light of the situation. I think that Carson and Mrs. Hughes will have some sort of argument in the next episode about it. I was hoping that she would stand up to him when he said he thought she was a woman with standards. 

Bates will be out of prison next episode, so maybe that storyline will finaly become interesting again. I'm just happy we don't have to watch the same Anna goes to visit Bates in prison scene again. They really stretched that much longer that they should have. 

And finally, I don't give a fuck about the new footmen or kitchen maid. Their storylines don't interest me at all. Daisy's is kind of fascinating, but I don't want her to leave the show, so I hope it goes nowhere/ she accepts the inheritance for sometime in the distant future.  "	t5_2seky	True

The actress who plays her seems like a doll in all of her interviews, but I really don't know how I feel about how her character is going to fit in now living with the Crawleys. Seems like Cora and Robert might have their hands full making sure Tom is raising Sybbie to be a lady, and Mary and the new heir (Matthew Jr.?) and all of the entail stuff with the home and line of Earls, and so Rose would have time to go off galavanting without them noticing.

If people would like me to post more of this, I'd be happy to. Hope this doesn't get me in trouble with the book publishers, haha.

-------------------

**Bates and Molesley**: This was an omitted piece of dialogue.

S1E2

&gt; ANNA: I wonder what that Mr Molesley makes of them.

&gt; WILLIAM: Mr Bates, you know Mr Molesley, don't you?

&gt; BATES: I do. We were footmen together. In a house near Stafford. Before the South African War.

----------------

**Mary**:

S1E3

&gt; ""In the edit, the Powers made a cut we all came to regret. After commenting that Mary 'could still be a virgin for your husband', which stayed in, Kemal was supposed to say: 'A little imagination, a phial of blood hidden beneath the pillow, you wouldn't be the first.' But this was excised. Despite arguing fairly passionately, I could not convince them the lines were needed. I explained that, without them, it was anyone's guess what Kemal was doing to Mary that would leave her virginity intact. But they were confident that no one would make any untoward connection. 'Nobody will think that,' they said. But everyone thought it. We had letters and calls of complaint, we had indignant Turkish viewers, and no wonder. However, one thing I did realise from this moment and that was the extent to which people were watching the show in detail; some of them would see every episode two, three, four times. All of which meant they assumed that Pamuk must have done something unspeakable which we won't name here. We never came up against another cut that was quite as misleading, but it did mean that when there was a line that made all the difference to the sense of a scene I was a much tougher fighter thereafter.""

[Conspiracy Theory Alert]

Here's what I'm thinking that would tie up some loose ends presented in this episode.  Here are the facts that we know:

-Branson was thinking about leaving for Liverpool.

-The baby's christening is going to be a big deal.

-Cora said she would support Branson and the baby... given Sybil's last wishes, I expect A) The baby will be Catholic, and B) Branson will be supported (but, importantly, may not accept... especially when we consider his character.)

-Matthew may be infertile (furthermore the fact that the doctor got Sybil's condition wrong means, perhaps, that he screwed up with Matthew.)


So, lets say that Branson is offered support, but can't accept it.  I expect there would be a few other extenuating circumstances.  Ultimately, I feel like he's going to go running back to Ireland (perhaps even with the baby).  I expect that he'll be arrested, found guilty, and executed (maybe this will happen in the same episode that Bates is freed???).  The baby will of course come back to Downton.  NOW, at this point Matthew will find out for certain that he's infertile.  Why shouldn't he and Mary then adopt the child?

&gt;A coconut shy (or coconut shie) is a traditional game, originally known as “The love grove alley”, frequently found as a sidestall at funfairs and fêtes. The game consists of throwing wooden balls at a row of coconuts balanced on posts.

&gt;Typically a player buys three balls and wins each coconut successfully dislodged. In some cases other prizes may be won instead of the coconuts.

&gt;The word “shy” in this context is a colloquial English term, meaning ‘to throw’ or toss. The origins of the game are unclear, although the term is first listed in the Oxford English Dictionary in 1903."	t5_2seky	True

For me it's the littlest and the folksiest.	turkeypants	26	7	14	"*Well, this somehow turned into an essay on why the show resonates with me. But holla back and let me know how your perspective compares. I'm interested in what different people get out of it, in what/who resonates with you.*

I find I'm having Downton Withdrawal Syndrome. During the day I find myself wishing I could hear Mrs. Patmore's folksy, rosy-cheeked aphorisms or innocent Daisy's adorable Yorkshire accent coming out of that pale, humble face. I miss Anna's little curtsy bob and her subtle and judicious tact when Lady Mary drags her into some debate with Matthew or the other ladies (and Bates is no good for you, you angel - he's a stern old grouch!). I suppose I sort of miss the elegantly restrained yet crisp barbs that Carson aims at Thomas or Mrs. O'Brien at table in the servants' hall. 

Everybody upstairs except the deliciously devilish DC can go hang as far as I'm concerned but sometimes I suppose I'd like to hear some of Robert's confident command. But really it's Mrs. Patmore and Daisy I mostly want to soak up, and sweet Anna as runner up (though she's pitched as being more like us). 

It reminds me of reading the early books in Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. I just wanted to go be in Emond's Field and soak up simple daily life in the village. I wanted to live there for real. I wanted someone to rap me on the knuckles for trying to steal a pie off a window sill, wanted to go have an ale at the inn, wanted to see a child herding geese with a stick on the village green, wanted to walk to town leading a donkey pulling a cart of produce, wanted to hear the clang of Master Luhhan's hammer at the forge, wanted to see people bargaining with a trader for thread and needles or examining a horse for sale, etc. I didn't want to go be part of the flashy stuff like magic or palaces or battles or monsters. I wanted the simple stuff of daily life in a humble village.

Likewise I want to be hanging out at the counter down in the kitchen as Mrs. Patmore gesticulates with her long wooden spoon and bustles about overseeing meal prep, as naive and innocent young Daisy awkwardly attempts to learn how life works, as Earnest Alfred pops in with a guileless word or two while picking up the tart to take upstairs, as the place buzzes like a hive with a dozen people hurrying about their tasks.

For me, that is the romance of the show. I'm sure it's idealized/romanticized/simplified now that we're this far removed from it historically and because it's a story and because it's tv, but I love essentially bathing in the rustic charm and simplicity of the little downstairs people and their lives. I guess there's something childlike and therefore endearing about the way their mindset is presented and about the way they perceive their social position.

On the one hand they can feel small and unworthy compared to the upstairsers, while on the other they can strut and be proud of ""their"" upstairsers and ""their"" house compared to some other house and its upstairsers. On the one hand they gripe and grouse like ""God forbid she should ever run a comb through 'er own 'air,"" while on the other hand looking on adoringly as one of them stands at the altar looking perfect and saying ""I do"". On the one hand they can roll their eyes about the ridiculous meal demands surrounding some event upstairs while on the other, apologize for sitting in the lord's presence as they almost pass out.

Being American and living in the present day, I have no analogue for any of it aside from other stories just like it. I've never been able to grasp the pre-war British notion of ""service"" and its seemingly feudal, implied acceptance of inferiority. I've never understood the more defined and rigid class roles, the exaggerated notion of the reality of blue blood betterness. So, using my own context as my lens, I'm sympathetic to the little people, and the real-life historical counterparts they represent, and sort of root for them to stand up and realize they're as good as anyone. I get wistful about people I never met in an era I never experienced. 

I love love loved it when Ygritte the Wildling (or whatever her Downton maid name was) escaped a life of service and became a secretary. The pluck and courage she showed by getting that typewriter and doing the correspondence course, the despair and defeat in her whole body and in her voice when she thought ""her kind"" could never do better in life, the ebullience and liberation she showed when she got the job. Ohhh that was just wonderful, that transition from ""I can't, I'm no good, I'm not worthy, I could never,"" to ""I can do this, I'm good."" Ohhhh. That's universal as a story theme and is one we can all identify with fundamentally in our own context, but it plays out so acutely in their particular setting.

I imagine it's a bit of an ego stroke for me, because these people are presented as less than me and I can indulge in the conceit of sympathy from my lofty perch of modern wisdom. But I don't care; I love it. I love to think about them and their lives and try to imagine the lives of their real-life counterparts, a whole society layer of them, and how their perspectives must have changed as the era of service and aristocracy faded away. Maybe they felt evolved and liberated and better off, like how Americans imagine Russians had to have felt after the fall of the USSR. Or maybe they felt wistful for the old ways, like many older Russians say they actually feel about the Soviet period. Either way - go, little people, go! You're the good ones! 

**tldr** - I love the little people, the simpler and folksier and earnest-er the better.

(Above Barons and Knights but below Dukes, Princes and so forth) They're obviously well above any of their servants and any of their higher-ups servants. This is the entire premise for the show.

But has anyone ever wondered how the Crawley's are treated by others in English aristocracy? When Sibyl came out into society we didn't see any of it. We know they're constantly worried about various scandals within the family (and Downton) ""getting out"" and if a newspaper were to get involved (shoutout to Season 2!) it would cause an uproar. But we never saw anything.

So I'm asking, does anyone feel like it's hard to understand the severity of backlash that would come from a major scandal? We don't see that side of the show and I find it difficult to really care if a scandal gets out because we don't see ""society's"" scorn or retaliation to the many that have already happened.

Here's what happened:  The show was shot either 23.98P or 25P, fine, easy to author to Blu Ray and have it look good.  Here's what wrong with the authoring.

The Laura Linney intro at the beginning is 1080i.  I'm guessing in order to accomodate this in authoring, they converted the 23.98 or 25p material to 29.97 in an inferior manner.  

Instead of using a standard 3:2 pulldown (convert 24 frames to 3 fields/2 fields, etc).  They converted as (2 fields, 2 fields, 2 fields, 4 fields)  This results in the horrendous stutter that we are all experiencing.

1344278960.0	xs1oi	Is Thomas's... well, big secret, actually an open secret among the staff? (minor spoilers inside, but I've only seen the first three episodes so please keep that in mind!)	Naberius	17	4	10	"Okay, so it's obvious to us that Thomas is gay, and that's a really big deal at this time in history. But in the first three episodes I've seen two different characters say things, on two distinct occasions, that strongly suggest that they're aware he's gay. In both cases the statements are hard for me to read as anything *but* sort of snide innuendo about it.

First is the cook, when Daisy is being all fluff-headed over Thomas while the other footman is being all fluff-headed over her. Daisy says something about how the junior footman ""isn't like Thomas"" and the cook responds with a knowing ""no, he isn't!""

The other is none other than Bates speaking *to Lord Grantham himself(!)* making some comment about Thomas having an eye for good looking male guests. I can't imagine Bates saying something like that to Lord Grantham, and it even implies that Lord Grantham knows what they're sort of talking around.

The cook's comment I could let slide. That could have meant a lot of things. But after Bates's comment, I was very confused. Homosexuality was something people went to jail for back then. And it's not like these people can keep secrets. Gwen's typewriter becomes the talk of the household in about half an hour once someone besides Gwen herself becomes aware of it.

I can't imagine that if even one other person knew what Thomas got up to with those good looking men, that it would remain a kind of open secret that everyone would just wink about and pretend not to know. Thomas probably wouldn't end up in jail because the family wouldn't want the scandal, but I'm pretty positive he'd be quietly sent away before said scandal could attach itself, and that would be the end of that.

So what is supposed to be going on here? Are the more observant characters aware of Thomas's orientation? If so, why is he still there? If not, why do people keep talking about him in ways that seem so laced with innuendo and secret knowledge?"	t5_2seky	True

Thomas doesn't want to help O'Brien's nephew Alfred make the leap to being a valet, because Alfred hasn't been working there for too long and it took Thomas many years to work his way up to valet. Not an altogether unreasonable response on Thomas's part.

So O'Brien:
-Hides Lord Grantham's shirts to get Thomas in trouble

-Tricks Thomas into thinking Jimmy is interested to make sure Thomas's heart gets good and broken

-Manipulates Jimmy and Alfred into reporting it so that Thomas loses his job

-That's not enough so she tries to make sure he not only loses his job but loses his reference to make sure he's unemployable

-That's still not enough so she tries to get him arrested and thrown into prison

Meanwhile, Thomas grows visibly more and more depressed and defeated every step of the way. O'Brien could have easily declared her victory at any point. But she doesn't. She takes it to the furthest extremes.

The first time I watched Season 3, I didn't quite realize the level of pathological insanity at play here because it's spread out over several episodes. But this is really, truly crazy: she wants to completely and utterly destroy his life.

But I don't recall any point in the series prior to then (except not too long before when O'Brien started telling Thomas that Jimmy was into him) when we as the audience were shown that anyone in the house had any inkling of it. In fact, Jimmy seems to be the first to have suspected anything because Thomas was always grinding up on him while clock winding and whatnot. Did I miss anything in prior episodes where people in the house got the impression he was gay or is this just a bit of ret-conning?

It very much reminds me of Mad Men in quality. Hopefully recognition and awards will result in continued support and more seasons.


In season 3, I suspect, the marriage, Bates getting freed, Sybil's baby and the Irish family might be big. I wonder if they would play a visit to America as the 1920s is the flapper/roaring 20s/Great Gatsby age (probably not with the marriage or filming budget needed). Tabloid rags report Cora's American mother will be heavily involved to counter the Countess Dowager with possible religious (Jewish?) battles. There's also Ethel's baby, and O'Brian's secret.

I, unfortunately, am guilty of hoping the marriage will be rocky simply for the sole reason of greater entertainment value. &gt;:)

My girlfriend has been stubborn about catching up and I just need to know what others think about this:

Does anyone else think Mrs. Hughes is still dying and merely concealing it to avoid being coddled? The three things that peak my suspicion are:

* The way she watched Mr. Carson singing when he heard the good news but turned away quickly, possibly in tears.
* She seems mellowed out; she seems to be at almost a weird place between melancholia and euphoria.
* The way the toaster sort of made her come across as young and progressive like someone really living the end of their days to their fullest.

Sorry if this is obvious to everyone else. It seemed obvious to me too, but the way you could easily dismiss it has made me a little unsure.

2- How Mr. Crawley is related to Robert? and why him and his mother moved to Downton in that particular time?

Was that Julian Fellowes messing with us or did I just spoiled all of series 2 for myself?

1324269175.0	ni40e	Missing scenes from DVD (US)	CCPhilly	6	0	4	"So I live in the US and I saw Downton Abbey on Netflix this past spring and bought it on DVD in August. I went through a lot of trouble to buy the UK broadcast edition because I read about what PBS did to the editing of their American airing. 

Masterpiece is showing it on TV now, and there are scenes that are NOT on my DVD, and I'm shocked, and actually kind of mad, that I didn't get all the scenes. 

There is the scene in episode 1 where Edith goes into her father's library and they cry, hug, and hold hands because they are sad about Patrick. There is also the conversation between the Dowager Countess and Cora about asking Matthew to look into the terms of the entail... just the last two lines ""I would hate to go behind Robert's back."" ""That is a scruple no good wife can afford.""

I've only some of the re-air on PBS thus far, so I'm sure there will be others in the further episodes.

Fellow DA lovers: am I wrong about these scenes? Am I hallucinating and have I just missed them every time on my DVD? Were they really part of the original UK broadcast? Do you think there is any good in emailing PBS to ask about it? It bothers me that I wanted the full version that PBS hadn't messed with and here I was still missing scenes from the 'complete' edition.

This is obviously a reference to the character of [Mr. Toad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Toad) in Kenneth Grahame's 1908 novel *[The Wind in the Willows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind_in_the_Willows)*. But is it a reference to the novel (published several years before WWI broke out, during which time this episode takes place), or to a later work?

In 1929 a theatre in London produced a play by AA Milne (author of *Winnie the Pooh*) entitled *[Toad of Toad Hall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toad_of_Toad_Hall)*. Is the elder Lady Grantham referring to a play that was produced eleven years after the armistice?

In the original work, Mr. Toad lives in Toad Hall, but the phrase ""Toad of Toad Hall"" appears only once, halfway through [the novel](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/27805/27805-h/27805-h.htm).

On the other hand, last year the BBC [reported](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-16099279) on plans for a new stage production of *Wind in the Willows*. One of the writers is Downton's own Julian Fellowes.

What do you think? Is this a simple reference to the book, or a subtle plug for his forthcoming project, and therefore a possible chronology error?"	t5_2seky	True

1331697684.0	qvomc	Getting my fix	luna547	6	2	9	"So since the end of season 2, I've been on the search for the quickest fix, the best high. These are my findings concerning tv shows/movies, that resemble Downton Abbey. 

1. [Upstairs, Downstairs](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066722/) (1971) - This is a great  series. Quicker in pace than Downton and same theme: show follows the life of the servants as well as the aristocracy. If you watch it, you'll find striking similarities between the plot twists and so forth, between Downton Abbey and Upstairs, Downstairs.

2. [Gosford Park](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0280707/) (2001) I would describe the show as 'Clue' the movie, but not that lame. I really do believe the beginnings of Maggie Smith's, Lady Dowager stemmed from her character, Lady Trentham in this movie. Nice quick fix if you love Maggie and fine men. 

3. [Bleak House](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0442632/) (2005) Starring Gillian Anderson (Scully from X-files) and co-starring that British actor who always plays the bad guys, Charles Dance (from Game of Thrones), this tv series is not as visually appetizing as Downton, but it's just as drama filled. This is like Downton, but with the wedding viewers want (NOT TO SAY THERE WON'T BE A WEDDING IN  SEASON 3!!). I just finished the series, and I have to say I was rather pleased. I grew attached to characters, in the same way I do Downton. 

I have yet to watch ""North &amp; South"" or any other 'period dramas', but these are the ones I found so far, to be my temporary fix. I found them all on Netflix instant streaming, so I'm sorry I can't provide further information on my findings. I hope you enjoy at least one of these suggestions!"	t5_2seky	True

She will shamelessly parade the prostitutes around the village letting everyone in the village know that the women under her charge are all prostitutes and then she'll regale the village folk with graphic and shameful stories about their lives 'in the trenches', so to speak.  Because of the recent tragedy, Isobel does this to keep her mind busy and distracted.  Inadvertently she keeps the mind's of the men folk in the village, busy and distracted.  Amongst the men folk there is much talk down at the pub concerning the formation of the Whore Hospital Charity.

At Downton Manor, the silence seems almost absolute.  Except for the occasional scuff of shoe against carpet and a pitiful groan and wail from the water closet, only the dust barely moves through the shafts of sunlight piercing the unseen windows.  Mary lays in bed all day with the curtains drawn, staring off into the unfocused distance.  The doctor has 'given her something' for her 'postpartum troubling stuff'.  Every couple of hours, Mary is given her 'vitamin' injection.  It's a new wonder drug called CocaSmack.  It seems to help with Mary's 'trouble stuff'.  When given her vitamins, Mary's mouth slightly upturns.  In an amazing feat of superhuman focus and control,  Mary's smile imperceptibly disappears (it takes about 4 hours) and that's when the next 'vitamins' injection is administered.  All the while, Mary and Mathew's new baby 'Rufus' is being breastfed by a woman that actually has breasts while Mary listlessly looks on.  Robert and Cora fill their days with the game of hide and seek.  The manor is so huge that there are times where they don't find each other for a month or so.  Cora becomes quite annoyed that Robert didn't mention the train to London as one of his secret hiding places.  While in London, Robert helps procure patients for Isobel's Whore Hospital.  Edith begins cutting herself.  Tom works on his Cricket game and becomes obsessed with next years' game.  12 hours a day, rain or shine, Tom is out in the garden playing T-ball Cricket with the world class Crowley rose garden roses.  The family inside believe the sky is crying pastels in sympathy of the tragedy that's befallen them.  It's actually Tom, practicing. 


Downstairs, Carson is at the helm of the ship.  Slow and steady he guides Downton through these choppy waters.  Carson plots a straight and narrow course.  There is no room for deviation.  Carson and Mrs. Hughes meet in Carson's office every three hours, to the second!  Going over the finely tuned machine that purrs under Carson's operation, Carson and Mrs. Hughes go over the finest of details.  Carson decrees and Mrs. Hughes agrees, that a new rule shall be imposed on the staff.  Mr. Carson has become aware of two instances where Lord Grantham and the Dowager Countess of Grantham have raised their eyebrows and quietly stated, ""Noxious gasses.""  Mr. Carson, fearing for his reputation and the good name of the Crawley House, agitatedly declares to Mrs. Hughes, ""This will not stand!""  Carson announces the new rule at that night's staff dinner table.  ""There have been mumblings about the house on the subject of Noxious Fumes.  Mrs. Hughes and I have decided that for now on you will hold 'it' 'til you are able to take your leave, outside.  There you will release 'it'.  A sloppy 'fraaaaaaaaaaaaaap' breaks the tense silence.  Mr. Bates snorts and Thomas sits there with an altar boy smile plastered to his face.  Not to be subordinated, Mr. Carson releases a legendary 'it'.  'It' is talked about for many years.  Mr. Carson, after displaying his dominance, has silenced the table into subservience.  [Que the music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdY3gWRcl-Y&amp;list=PLAB3A64B7B7F9309A). So starts the 4th season of Downton Abbey.

I've noticed that it seems to be fair game to comment on what is shown during the ""scenes from next week"" segment, and I'm wondering if we might make a change on that front. As someone who hates being spoiled for future events, I turn off my TV the instant I see the ""Next Week..."" graphic in the corner of the screen, but then I come to this subreddit to discuss the show with you fine chaps and I find myself spoiled via many of your comments. 

I don't think it's unreasonable to hope that a thread entitled ""Season 3 Episode 7 Discussion"" would pertain to only episode 7 and nothing of episode 8 but that is just not the case. So what do you guys think? Can we at least start using spoiler tags when referencing events that have yet to air but as a teaser?"	t5_2seky	True

Anyway, my main issue with this show is when Bates is in prison.  I'm not sure how long he's there for, but I'd assume it's quite awhile (a couple of years maybe?)  Not ONE TIME does Anna waver.  At all.  At ALL.  I feel like if he was in there long enough she would have broken down at least once and been like ""I can't do this, oh my God, do you promise you didn't kill her?""  She never got hysterical.  

And Bates!  I really liked how they rounded out his character a little more in prison, as we kind of see the ""angry"" side of Bates.  However, the thing that upsets him the most in prison isn't moldy bread or the possibility of rape, but the fact that Downton Abbey is going to be lost.  Really?  NOTHING else got to him?  Maybe being in prison and wrongfully accused?  

Anyway, these are just some thoughts.  On the whole, I really like Bates' character (could take or leave Anna).  Anyone else had thoughts like these?"	t5_2seky	True

i'm not sure what it is, but i hate the actress playing the family mother.  i'm aware that if you were to describe to someone how much of a stereotype the grandmother was of aristocratic indignant refusal of change, they would still be surprised by her performance.  i also feel that other parts of the show border on soap opera levels of drama, and i'm ok with that, this is something of an exceptional costume drama.  


but it's the mother i cannot stand.  ie:
IM ACTING CANT YOU SEE HOW HARD IM ACTING LOOK LOOK IM ACTING LIKE AN AMERICAN/BRITISH PERSON.

why do i feel this way?  the daughters don't bother me as much, pigeon-holed as they are.
