1338418048.0	ucv3e	Last year I made a Google calendar of Chicago events. This year I've done the same, but somehow it got quite bigger.	Guinness	763	108	139	"As I said, [last year](http://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/hima6/june_events_youre_welcome/) I created a gcal of every Chicago Summer event I could think of. It took me over a month to validate and enter all of the data.


This year, I've decided to do it again. Two months of on again/off again research, verification, and entry brings me to this. Off the top of my head, it contains EVERY movie in the park, home Cubs/Sox game, Millenium Park Concert, Grant Park Concert/Festival, Summerdance, fireworks, neighborhood fest, free museum dates and more. All in all, it includes 760 events.


Each event is individually listed with (mostly) accurate start times, dates, info, maps, and source info just for verification. Below is the link to the direct calendar, and a link in case you're on the go and forgot to bookmark it on your phone.

1302638004.0	gogtj	"To the guy who yelled ""Reddit"" and gave me a thumbs up.."	Hop_Slam	711	97	73	"You were driving a silver Honda on Lincoln on Saturday night around 11pm.  I was riding my bike with traffic and you noticed the big Reddit Alien sticker on my helmet.  You drove by, gave me a thumbs up and yelled “Reddit!”  You couldn’t have known, but that small encounter put a big smile on my face.  The previous 9 hours of Saturday had been absolute hell… I was riding home from Illinois Masonic, where my gf was in the trauma ward for 3 hours.

We had been biking down Belmont (by Shubas) earlier in the day, on our way to pick up race packets for the shuffle.  She is normally very cautious, but for a brief moment, veered too close to a parked car.  Her right handle hit a side mirror and spun her wheel instantly, to which she flipped over the handle bars, landing on her shoulder and head.  As I was right behind her, I hit the brakes as hard as possible, but still nailed her fallen bike and flipped myself.  I bolted up, threw the bikes out of the way, and kneeled beside her.  She wasn’t responding for all two seconds, but quickly started crying.  I turned her over carefully as others gathered around.  A nice biker came up and gave me a towel to wipe her face off, another lady pulled up in her SUV and called 911 (also blocking traffic to avoid us being run over).  

My gf was still crying, but was able to wiggle her fingers, toes, legs, and left arm.  I figured she was okay, but just hurt her right shoulder.  That’s when she looked at me with wide eyes and asked “why are we here, what is going on?” and started to panic.  I tried my best to calm her down and the paramedics arrived a few moments later.  They put her on a gurney and told me to meet them at Illinois Masonic.  They took off and I was left with two bikes on the side of the road.  My bike was fine, but her front tire was jacked.  I carried her bike a few blocks to Pure Nirvana Spa where I knew the owner and he stored her bike in a storage closet.  I biked to the hospital and waited patiently for her outside the trauma center.

After their tests, it turned out that she had a bad concussion (cracked her helmet!) and separated her shoulder.  They had to keep her for 24 hours since she lost conscience and let me stay until 11pm.  I was hungry, had dried blood on my arms, and just had a terrible day.  Luckily she was ‘fine’ but it was a huge scare and I was drained.  That’s when you drove by, yelled about a website, gave me a thumbs up… and made me happy for the first time in the day… thanks man..

They sit literally at the corner of the plant's lot and after speaking to two security guards I was just told to forget about them. Well I can't afford getting another pair and really like these ones. Plus the fact that they sit in a very specific location that isn't getting traffic just sucks to think that I have to ditch them.

Looking at Google maps you can see two trees on the North-West corner and that's where they're at. [777 W. Chicago Ave, Chicago, IL](http://g.co/maps/4kuep)

Please, if anyone can help me I would greatly appreciate it.

EDIT: So I got my glasses back! Everything DyersEve and SH4RK4TT4CK said was correct. Luckily I had received a PM from another redditor that lived near by and had climbing gear. He was able to get down into the pit and after heavy searching in the brush found them. The place is literally surrounded by those concrete blocks so the only way was up and over for sure.

Eat_Yr_Vegetables	503	104	66	"UPDATE: Thank you to everyone who donated and came out to sing!  Sorry for the slow reply but I spent all day hung over and counting money!  With your help we raised $1195 for the emergency fund!  

I was approached by my coworkers to organize an event to raise $2,000 for a [Child Welfare](http://www.associationhouse.org/services/childwelfare) fund that our caseworkers established to pay for diapers, clothing, and other items that kids immediately need when they come in to our care. Other than being given the seed money to pay for the band - I haven't had much help organizing or promoting the event. 

I know reddit sometimes rallies for different causes, but in this case would you consider singing?  The karaoke band is amazing and has a great ever-growing [song catalog](http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Jam-Live-Band-Karaoke/114239858682124?sk=info). 

The basics: Tonight at Subterranean in Wicker Park (Damen Blue Line). We have a comedian going on at 8, band starts playing at 8:30. Tickets are $15, and after the space rental is covered, all proceeds go directly to the fund. You can buy tickets [online as a donation + $4 in fees](http://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?dispatch=loadSelectionData&amp;eventId=3121234&amp;pl=bk) or  just pay $15 cash at the door.   There is a ton of information on our [Facebook event page](http://www.facebook.com/events/225053754289695/), if you have a minute to check it out and maybe tell your charitable/musical theater friends?

Thanks r/Chicago, I'm happy to have such a great hometown subreddit!"	t5_2qh2t	True

It was a very stupid decision and I'm so thankful that I'm alive and unharmed. A woman named Kathleen saved me-I don't remember anything of the 9 hours I lost before waking up on a friends couch except this lady names Kathleen finding me while I was crying at a train station and she told me I would be ok. She was an older woman (maybe late 40's early 50's?) I think she had shoulder length hair that was maybe a medium blonde or light brown? I'm hoping maybe she's somebody who is on here's mother or aunt? She saved my life-I have no doubt that my life may be way different if she didn't find me. All I remember is her saying ""my name is Kathleen and you're going to be ok"" 

Maybe did somebody hear of a woman saving a girl at pride? I have to at least attempt to give my thanks to her! Thanks!"	t5_2qh2t	True

1350323273.0	11irr6	Was your bike stolen on the Northside?  It's probably here.	AlexRage	422	72	122	"My bike was stolen last Thursday from my garage...and I found it three blocks away at a used bike shop.  This place: http://www.yelp.com/biz/shining-bikes-and-things-chicago has changed names numerous times, and constantly advertises on Craigslist: http://chicago.craigslist.org/chc/bid/3334398481.html

Guy claims the bike was ""given"" to him by some kid.  Because a bike shop would just accept a gift of a bike that has $500 worth of brand new parts.

After calling the cops, I got my frame, fork, crank, and seat back...handlebars, $300 wheels, brakes, were already stripped down.

Other yelp reviews claim similar stories of finding their stolen bikes at this place.  Cops couldn't do anything about it.  What are the options here?  Who can I report this place to?

EDIT:
Here are some facts that lead me to conclude this place is part of a systematic ring of bike thieves.

* My bike was hanging on the wall of my garage.  I park really close to that wall when I'm home, so the bike had to have been stolen during the day, while I was at work.

* It takes at least a couple of minutes to take the bike down from the rack on the wall.  The rack is quite a ways in from the garage door.

* On Thursday, my land lord was working in the garage, and possibly stepped away for a minute.

* Nothing else was stolen from the garage.  Power tools in cases, motorcycle parts, a cheap Huffy bike were all left.  A typical alley scrapper would have gone for the easier stuff.

* The thieves identified the value of the bike on the wall, even though it looks like trash to most people.  The Huffy would have been easier to take, and looks considerably nicer to a petty crook.

* The bike shop started stripping down all of the expensive parts.  They really make the bike easily identifiable.  The parts I was able to recover from the shop were already disconnected from the frame.

* Owner exclaimed that he did not want the cops in there and was ready to deal his way out of this."	t5_2qh2t	True

* If you're pulled over by a UIC cop, you may not have done anything wrong, but you're still getting a ticket.
* Chicagoans only honk at two things: making things personal (which can be anything, really), and thinking you're in your own little fucking world.  God I hate that.
* If you really need to do something, like cut across 4 lanes of traffic at the light to make the turn, be patient, turn on your signal, and floor it.  Chicagoans hate timidity, but will respect a well-executed desperate maneuver.
* Taxis are generally jerks and will occasionally race you, but...
* Pace vehicle drivers are the biggest assholes on this side of the planet.  Just accept it's probably Stalin behind the wheel and you'll be slightly less offended.
* Chicago police SUVs are allowed to do whatever the hell they want, no exceptions.  If one is driving casually towards you the wrong way down a one-way street, or parked sideways across the route you want to take, just accept that you're actually the one who is wrong.  Wave apologetically and compensate accordingly.
* Bikers only materialize when you've forgotten you're next to a bike lane.
* Rush hour into or out of the city always has the same slow downs in the same place, and will be the same travel time every day.  You can rely on it like clockwork year round, but...
* Construction fucks up everything, and...
* Weekend traffic is far worse than rush hour traffic.  I swear, the extremely aged and zombified parents of 7 flock to the highway to die.
* The speed limit is how fast your car can cover the gap in front of you, regardless of distance.
*  A slight beep at a green light is not a honk, it's the Chicago friendly reminder that we're all generally pretty easy-going and nice.  :)

Any more?

EDIT!:

* Pedestrians WILL exercise their right of way by never looking both ways.  You could be a dump-truck and they still wouldn't care.  Make sure you never let your brakes go bad.
* For legal reasons, use your turn signal, but only just as you start turning.
* If you *really* piss off a Chicago driver (blatant disrespect is the easiest way) expect retribution up to several miles from the point of offense."	t5_2qh2t	True

That said, Please respect our City,  seriously.  I don't want to see another Vancouver, or Seattle.  Most Chicagoan's do not have the consensus that NATO is something to be protested, and are largely seeing this conference as a major pain in the ass.  From the enhanced security, to the road and L closures the following week and ultimately the weekend are not going to be fun for anyone that lives in or has to commute to the city.  


Yes NATO are evil bastard men, and yes they deserve to be protested. But please keep in mind the last thing any of us who call Chicago home want to see is windows smashed, riots, tear gas, and full blown anarchy.   Please keep in mind if the protests do escalate to the levels of Seattle or Vancouver we have to pay for it and clean it, you don't. 


If you do decide to go ape shit the only warning I have is that Chicago Cops are  corrupt people (not all of them are) who will have no problems using excessive force as more than likely there will be no reprimanding. 


The city of Chicago IS NOT NATO and does not deserve to be treated as such.

No one wants to hear it."" The guy looks at you funny, pretending not to hear it. You continue, ""YEAH. YOUR MUSIC IS OBNOXIOUS. YOU NEED TO GET SOME HEADPHONES."" Again, the guy shurgs you off. You persist, ""BUDDY, TURN YOUR FUCKING MUSIC OFF."" At this point a few others chime in in agreement.

It's been encouraging to see a disproportionate number on /r/chicago dedicated to the teacher's strike here in Chicago. It's been equally depressing to see people fighting on the Internet without good information.

It's probably time for an AMA. A few notes:

* Background: My wife works teaching a first grade class of 32 on the south side of Chicago. She's a dedicated teacher with a bachelor's from the University of Chicago and a master's in education from [their inner-city specific teaching program](http://utep.uchicago.edu/)
* [This summarizes most of the complaints we have about CPS](http://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/zni67/this_just_happened_to_my_sister/c66gd1g)
* As best I can, I'll distinguish between personal experience and opinions and those that are more broadly held. 
* My wife is currently picketing. I'd expect to be able to answer most questions directly, but she'll be actively IM/texting me back and will join on with her own account around noon. She's agreed to participate, and questions answered by me will be direct comments, from her = in quotes, as is tradition. 
* Don't mistake the teachers' union, or their spokeswoman, for CPS teachers. CTU does defend teachers' interests, but in many cases we have serious concerns about the public face of this dispute. The strike may be between the union and CPS, but the reasons 90% of teachers agreed to walk out of work without pay are myriad.

Well, I apparently didn't secure it to my bike properly, and it fell off along the way. The bag contained my work clothes for the day, my wallet, and my work phone. After re-tracing my route and not spotting it, I hopped the train in to work, and started making calls to cancel cards and whatnot. I tried calling my work cell one last time before reporting it stolen, and to my surprise, someone answered. It was a limo driver who had picked up my bag in the street and was planning on giving the owner a day to call before turning it in to the police. He was 3 blocks away from my office, so he swung by and dropped it off. I'm completely amazed to have actually found there's still honest people in this city.	t5_2qh2t	True

However, after watching the news the past few days, I'm proud to say I'm from Chicago. The city where the police seem to actually do their job - serve and protect. They have acted with restraint and professionalism to a level I did not expect. 

Good job Chicago PD, it's not often a police department exceeds my expectations.

**Edit: To those saying I'm obviously blind to the abuse that HAS happened during the NATO summit, I'll argue that compared to other cities (Oakland comes to mind, but many others), the abuse and arrests have been comparatively minor - and often warranted. No, they're not perfect; I'm merely saying they did an exceptional job compared to other towns in similar circumstances. Hell, I can't even say that - it's not like we've hosted a NATO summit in the past couple years in any large American town. Police in other cities act with far more abuse of power for smaller protests than we've seen here in Chicago. Keep that perspective in mind?**"	t5_2qh2t	True

Medieval_Chicago	313	65	129	"(I originally posted this on AskReddit and the mods removed it. Sorry about that, I'm new to reddit!)

Admittedly, I'm a first time redditor and this came about from a drunken conversation with a group of friends, but every time we go to Medieval Times (which is probably more times than I'd like to admit), we request the Green Knight section. We know he's the antagonist of the show but shit, it's so much more fun cheering the Green Knight on to his inevitable end.

For redditors in the Chicagoland area (specifically near the Schaumburg, Ill. location...), who would be interested in a monumental event where every single seat is rooting for the Green Knight (wearing green clothes, green facepaint, etc.)? Also, every person would have to talk as much shit as possible towards the other knights (because common, it's pretty obvious that our loyalties lie with the Green Knight and his squire).
I'd be more than happy to set up this entire event (I'm going to call the Schaumburg, Ill. location later today to see if all of the seats are available for a middle of August weekend) and even open up a paypal account to acquire the cash to purchase every single ticket. I wouldn't be able to front all of the money, but I can certainly act as the mediator for the entire group.

Who's down?

**UPDATE 1**:
I've spoken to the national contact center and they've informed me that I need to call the group sales manager at the particular castle in question. Unfortunately, they are only open Mon-Fri from 9 to 5. I will call them first thing tomorrow morning to get this train rolling. 

The CS rep/maiden/wench that I spoke to thought it was a great idea and she said that the group sales manager is a lot of fun and will definitely be willing to work with me on this. 

The Schaumburg location can seat 1450 people. I'll crosspost this to the various places people have suggested so I can hopefully get as many people as possible. Start telling your friends, people! 

**UPDATE 2**:
Unfortunately the group sales manager didn't call me back after I left her a voicemail earlier this afternoon. I will try again multiple times tomorrow. I'm going to be persistent as shit!

**UPDATE 3**:
Alright, we've got some preliminary info! It turns out that Mike, the group sales rep I am speaking to, just happens to have been a green knight for over 20 years and loves the idea. Warms my cockles right there.

So, in order to get the best deal, we've sent a tentative date of September 19th. That is a Wednesday, which means it will be cheaper than a weekend but I can understand that some people may not be able to attend due to their work schedule. We would be able to get an exclusive show for 350 people at about $35-40 a person (normal price is $60). I will have to collect all of the money myself, but the minimum we would have to reach would be about $15,000 to $20,000 (a Saturday during the summer would require about $100,000 to $125,000). Everyone would get a green crown. The payment isn't due until 2 weeks prior to the event.

Next steps for me is to try and get the word out as much as possible and see if we can get 1450 people and take up the entire space. Also, I will start doing some research and look for the best, safest way for people to pay for their ticket(s) that will refundable if this doesn't turn out. This would be in addition to giving everyone as much piece of mind as I can that I'm trying to do this because of how absurdly awesome it would be and not trying to be a asshole scammer making a quick buck. 

If we do indeed get the maximum amount of people, I'm not 100% sure if the price per ticket will go down or not. We'll have to play that one by ear unfortunately. Also, Mike has to run this by his manager for approval. I'm expecting to hear from him sometime this weekend or possibly next week depending on his schedule.

Thanks to everyone so far for the enthusiasm! I hope to *god* we pull this off. It will be so goddam epic. "	t5_2qh2t	True

Some of you may remember the following post from about two months ago:
[Need help getting engaged in Chicago](http://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/18dqnx/need_help_getting_engaged_in_chicago/)



Well, after reaching out to r/Chicago, I was able to put together a wild and crazy plan. Ask my girlfriend of six years to marry me as a band swarms us, playing the theme from Sanford and Son. Totally normal, right?


[Spoiler](/s ""she said yes"")


[And here's the video!] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx5Bn0-oVUA)


Anyways, that's all fun and everything, but this post is to say that none of this could have happened were it not for the awesome folks at r/chicago. Especially [u/urbaneyezcom] (http://www.reddit.com/user/urbaneyezcom) and [u/amandakey] (http://www.reddit.com/user/amandakey) for volunteering their time and talents to capture such a ridiculous, once-in-a-lifetime event that blew by so quickly I can hardly remember any of it. Not to mention Environmental Encroachment, Chicago's greatest rag-tag marching band who took the time to learn the song, assemble everyone at one spot, and play their god damn hearts out as I tried my best to play it cool.


You folks are fantastic and you've made Chicago even more awesome (minus the finger strain I got 10-pin bowling. Canadian 5-pin may be wussier, but at least I can still type after)

* How many people would be interested in coming out?
* Would you like to see a rock show, jazz show, electronic music show ect, or a mix of everything at the same concert?
* Would you be willing to pay a small cover? If not, would you actually tip the musicians if a bucket was passed around?

**edit: wow, this is getting a lot of momentum quickly.  I'll start looking into venues that can accommodate us.  It seems there are a lot of musicians wanting to play, and people are down for a variety of music.  Right now I'm thinking I'll set up 30 minute slots for everyone and alternating between bands/DJs/acoustic musicians to keep change overs short and fit in as many acts as possible.  If any bands would be willing to donate anything to a back line, that would help a great deal.  We may or may not need it depending on the venue**

edit 2: Thanks for letting me know this could work!  I'll probably start a thread and create a facebook event once I get some more details worked out.  I haven't yet decided on a system to pick artists, but I'll keep you posted.  Most likely I'll be doing that in r/chicagomusicscene.  "	t5_2qh2t	True

Hopefully, I either have enough internet credibility that you can figure out I am not a psychopath, or someone saw this happen, as it happened at 5:15 at Division and Damen on Valentine's Day.

I was walking my dogs on the north side of Division, near Wolcott, when my bulldog, Lunchbox, collapsed.  I immediately tried to revive her, and started chest compressions in seconds.  A handful of good people passing by started to help me out, one of which got her car and drove us to the vet.

I continued to try to save Lunchbox on the way to the vet, with my other dog trembling in fear next to us in the backseat of this generous woman's car.  Sadly, Lunchbox passed away before I could get her any help, and from what I understand, there was nothing anyone could have done in any case.

In the commotion, I never got the woman's name.

She didn't hesitate for a moment to help me, a stranger, with a dying best friend lying on the sidewalk.  She took care of my other dog, Nevada, while I tried to help Lunchbox.  She made sure that all of my things I left in her back seat made it into the vet, but vanished before I knew what happened.

It was valentine's day evening, I'm sure that this was the last thing she would ever want to encounter.  I can remember very little about her, but I do remember she had blonde hair, drove a black or dark colored SUV, and had children (there were toys in her back seat, one of which I set off and it played a song that one of my son's toys plays).  She said that she had 2 pugs, and I assume that she lives in the area near Division and Wolcott.

If anyone can help me find her, I would like to say thank you.  I have treats to drop off for her pugs, and I want her to know that her immense kindness is highly appreciated."	t5_2qh2t	True

Thankfully, the bike took the brunt of the collision and I escaped with nothing but a few scratches. This isn't a plea for anonymous sympathy, rather a reminder that one instant of negligence has the potential to alter someone's life. My incident was relatively minor, but on a different day it could have been far worse. So please, look before you open doors. Scold yourself every time you don't do it. In fact, scold others when you notice them not looking first. It could be the difference between a near-miss and a wheelchair.
