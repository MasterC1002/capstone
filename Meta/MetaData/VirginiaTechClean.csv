Why would they need our support?  The two tragedies have literally nothing in common.  Different body counts, different motives, and different environment.  They're not even on the same date.  They aren't comparable in the slightest, so stop trying to associate them.  Are we going to tie ourselves to every tragedy that happens in April?  It's like a child's plea for attention.  ""HEY LOOK SOMETHING BAD HAPPEND TO US A LONG TIME AGO NEAR THE SAME DATE!  DO YOU REMEMBER US?""  Don't bring it up anytime a tragedy happens and maybe we can be remembered for something other than adversity and hardship.  "	t5_2r39x	True
