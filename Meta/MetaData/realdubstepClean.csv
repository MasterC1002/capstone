1335885437.0	t1kcc	Why Coki is my hero	manslag	164	16	82	"So last night, I had an argument with Soap Dodgers' agent because I refused to make their name bigger on the flyer for my event, I refused because what seems like a simple task would be very time consuming and would mean I have to pay the graphic designer to re-draft the original design's alignment and proportions. 

As a result of my refusal, Soap Dodgers terminated our contract and no longer wanted to play on the line-up. So there I was, all pissed off because I'd lost a headline act which would have a dramatic effect on the evening.

However, just as I was losing hope, I'd seen a private message from Coki's personal Facebook account, he said it was petty what had happened and offered to take up the slot dropped by Soap Dodgers, and furthermore, he'd get El-B to play on the night as well, this came as a real shock to me as I know Coki's fees aren't cheap at all and can only be afforded by promoters with an extensive budget.

I wanted to share that story because most people I know talk negatively about him, I'm always hearing how he's arrogant, rude and very pessimistic, but I've yet to see that side...

So yeah, that's about it really, a big shout out to Coki and the rest of you, keep dubbing hard! :D

1314070700.0	jrbck	ATTENTION: All new subscribers (and old!) Please read, big tingz happening!	atm259	163	14	60	"As you all know there has been some back and forth between [r/dubstep](http://www.reddit.com/r/dubstep) and [r/realdubstep](http://www.reddit.com/r/dubstep). I would like to say a few things as moderator and creator of this subreddit:




(please upvote this so people can see!)

1. We are not at war with r/dubstep, we created r/realdubstep because at the time the discussion wasn't very healthy and we knew that people would want to here the UK sound as well. It was never about being better or elitist or any of that. We just liked different sounds. (In hindsight ""real"" sounds condescending or more genuine, but that was not the intention and I apologize for that.) 

2. ANYONE is welcome: skrillex fans, mala fans, remix fans, mixing/producing fans, trolls, etc. We already have quite a variety of users and music and there is something for everyone.

3. Why not both? I have posted tunes here and they have been upvoted, I have posted comments here and had healthy discussion. Both subreddits have value in the subreddit category.

4. We encourage our new users to click ""top"" and see what kind of sound our community is all about. You might not like it and if so, that's fine. No one is forcing you to do anything. If you want to submit your favorite classic dubstep tune, try the search bar, we might have beat you to it!

5. With that said, thanks do r/dubstep for the shout out. It means a lot coming from a subreddit 30x our size. We still look up to you guys :) I can take any questions if you have any and good luck to all steppas' out there!

We really are trying to discourage ""low effort"" posts like this. Memes and jacking off about what dubstep is and isn't is not what this place is about. We already *have* a very clear idea of what dubstep is and isn't - the mods were chosen precisely because of their ability to discern this. Every 'approved' (green ""check"" mark) submission here is going to be a dubstep track - and only rarely will anything *other than that kind of submission* be approved by one of the mods.

[/r/realdubstep](/r/realdubstep) is a subreddit dedicated to dubstep music. We want people listening to heavy chunes here, not arguing about shit. We started [/r/realdubstep](/r/realdubstep) because of all of the misinformed arguments that continue to happen at [/r/dubstep](/r/dubstep) to this day.

[Laughing] It has very little to do with me! Dubstep in the US has taken the place of nu metal. An electronic music rave in America now is like a Limp Bizkit concert 10 years ago. If you listen to a Skrillex set, it's basically just an orgasmic reaction every three minutes. It has little to do with what dubstep was really all about, which was sort of a meditation on bass. Now it's like a caricature of that in the US.

Some posts for those who can't/don't want to visit facebook:

For me this was the first Dubstep tune....The term 'Dubstep' came around shortly after this tune was made..It was either gonna be called that or 'Raggage'(Which sounds like an STD)

.....For me Horsepower Production's are the pioneers of the sound...

It dosent matter wether you listened in 2002 or discovered it in 2012....Just enjoy it...

---
To everyone replying ""Yeah but kids should know where it came from"" Why should they? Do you really know where it came from?

---
This seems to have rubbed some people up the wrong way.....I'm not trying to be an asshole in anyway, but I dont get why people spend so much time arguing about 'Dubstep'..Theres so much great stuff being made in all styles....The Deep/Youngsta style of stuff is the healthiest its ever been and theres some amazing tear-out being made..Yes there is alot of shit circulating but why concentrate on that?

---
It's pointless people trying to argue with me about Dubstep and the change that has happened over the last couple years....Its the biggest its ever been, I'm happy about that, why aren't you? Is Dubstep your child? Is it something you can put your name to? Why do you feel you have to spend so much time arguing about it? Mala is Mala, Skrillex is Skrillex.....End of..Good night....

---
When will people realise I'm passionate about this music...

Last post for now...Have a nice day.....

I live in Italy part of the time and go to university in Scotland, and people generally have a pretty warped perception of what the term 'dubstep' actually entails. Most think its just that whole class of Skrillex, Borgore, Rusko (I'm still a fan and probably always will be, but he's made some questionable career choices in recent years) and most tunes on recent UKF playlists, which at least my immediate social group classifies as garbage. They're aware of the existence of musicians like Kode9, Kromestar, DMZ etc. etc. but it seems to be that the awfulness of brostep exceeds the greatness of oldschool &amp; proper dubstep (in the sense that its more common, its pretty much everywhere these days). There's good recent dubstep, but people tend to focus on all the shit that's been produced in recent years instead. Do you think dubstep is on a downward spiral thanks to crappy associations to brostep music? It appears as if in this case, the bad exceeds the good, merely on the basis that the bad is kind of what most people are familiar with. Up until like 2007 or whatever (don't quote me on the date obviously, just giving an estimate) dubstep wasn't really a widely considered genre, but kind of thrived in the underground music scene whereas now, brostep (what most people think is actual dubstep) is played in advertisements, in supermarkets and is even the fucking song they play when they put me on hold for my Scottish bank! Half rant, half question, what's the situation like where all you guys are from? Are people hating on dubstep cus of all the lame/bro associations?

Edit: Wow, was not expecting this many comments. Yeah, I know this conversation may be redundant or old, but its pretty interesting to see what all you guys have to say, especially in different parts of the world. Kind of reflects the general attitude towards music as a whole, rather than a particular genre"	t5_2s9pu	True

Big ups everyone involved in the mix of the month series. It's been a great joy and burden of love keeping this going. We will only grow and hear more tunes advancing into 2013.  
  
It would like to invite anyone who has ideas, comments, or criticisms to let me or the mods know. This is still an evolving project and welcome all input on how to make the mix series better. Mostly, I would like to know how you all feel about the themes, and would like to hear your suggestions for future ones.  
  
Keep your eyes peeled for the January submissions which will be up soon.

I then played some grime, house and garage for a couple of hours after him. He also said WXWL003 is in the works and so is a big 2 track 12"" on a pretty big label (probably shouldn't say which one).

These lectures is a serious goldmine for any music nerd. I've seen the various Dubstep documentaries posted here have gathered a lot of attention so i have compiled a list of lectures i thought was relevant to this subreddit.

I've added some context where i thought it was needed.

JakR4bbit	50	4	74	"I'm pretty sure I don't know what the fuck dubstep is anymore after reading through the comments in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/dubstep/comments/jlslk/why_do_people_here_not_like_skrillex/). [This is the first ""dubstep"" song I was introduced to](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfZq-70w0uk), about 3 months ago. But I'm not even sure if this is what is considered to be ""dubstep"". I know it made my ears bleed and want more. Since then, I've developed a liking for (ready to flame?) Skrillex, Flux Pavilion, Borgore, Nero, SubVibe, Zomboy... just a few. Right now as I'm typing this, I'm listening to [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx4zaFB0Kn8&amp;feature=related). Just found it through random YouTube searches. I like this stuff. Pretty fucking sweet.

But now that I've discovered r/realdubstep, I'm not sure if what I've been listening to is even considered dubstep. I'm feeling like a bit of a poser because all this time my friends (who also listen to ""dubstep"" similar to what I listed above) and I have been listening to, well... not what's in this subreddit, and calling it dubstep. Are we way the fuck outta line here?

I've been pretty linear with my musical preferences my entire life. Mostly rock, alternative, and metal with a bit of techno in my early- and mid-teenage years. I think this has skewed my understanding of what makes a genre a genre. Just looking for some direction here. I don't want to be the douche walking around saying ""OMFG HAV U HERD THIS EPIC WUBWUB!?"", and calling it dubstep when it's not.

EDIT 1 (9/28/11): Never thought I would get this many awesome responses. I posted this last night and I find all of this 16 hours later. I will listen to all of these suggestions soon. For now, it's time to get outta the workplace and head home. Thanks again everyone.

""yo you know what that status caused me so much agro i kinda wish i'd put it differently. i certainly don't think 140 is dying i'm not gna stop making it and i don't have anything against house/techno just the majority of what's being pushed forward these days. ""

Any thoughts?  
  
A couple of things come to mind:  
If the new techno you're listening to just sounds like 10min long loops then you're listening to shite.  
I totally encourage Biome and other producers(established or not) to experiment with other BPMs and more importantly other sounds!  
Dubstep was all about pushing boundries and I feel the dungeon sound has been thoroughly explored, I love the growls and the deepness but surely theres more to it than that. "	t5_2s9pu	True

Let me start off by saying that I'm 23, and have been listening to dubstep for a little more than a year. I was introduced to the genre by Skrillex and brostep, but quickly made my way to r/realdubstep after listening with some quality headphones. This was my first dubstep show, with exception to some shit quality stuff at IDentity Fest last summer.

The show was in San Francisco and the first stop on their US tour. An ALL AGES show on a MONDAY night led to a crowd mostly comprised of high school kids or younger. The line-up was Hijak, Artwork, Alvin Risk, then Skream and Banga doing a back-to-back set together. They also had some rasta-brit MC on stage for the entire night. Also, there were no pauses in between sets, so I was left standing for 5 hours straight. The sound system on the other hand was without a doubt the best I've ever experienced. I now understand what is meant when people argue that dubstep must be EXPERIENCED, not just listened to.

This show overall was quite Brosteppy. Hijak's performance was probably the most forgettable. Now i had maybe heard one or two Alvin Risk tracks before, but wasn't really familiar with his style. I would describe his set as being heavily influenced by Skrillex with a bit more of a house vibe. While I didn't care for the music so much, I must admit he was quite the showman and really got the crowd going. 

Skream and Benga. These two and the MC went on about how ""This is London dubstep!"" but they would go on to play tracks that raped your ears with mids.. WTF man! I must emphasize that we're not talking about Doctor P or Skrillex type of mids, but certainly not that ""realdubstep"" sound. The S&amp;B set was about an hour and a half with some quality tracks but a lot less than what I was hoping for.

Artwork's set was second, and in my opinion the best. Acoustics in some tracks gave the feeling that the songs were literally swimming in your head. This was the experience I came for.

Overall, it was still a fun time. However, the lack of quality ""real dubstep"" left me wanting more. I know these guys are somewhat responsible for the genre, but I guess they just didn't quite do it for me. 

**tl;dr - first show of Skream and Benga US tour was mostly higher quality brotep on a really good sound system. all ages show on monday night led to a small-ish crowd of mostly youngsters. Artwork had best ""real dubstep"" set.**"	t5_2s9pu	True

So I have a finished dissertation on dubstep that I wrote earlier this year. The name in full is ""Contextualising Dubstep: The Role of Political Economy and Production Factors in Modern Day Dance Music"" which sounds more complicated than it actually is (academia). 

Basically what inspired me to write it was that I felt it was incredibly unfair that ""Dubstep"" now is a dirty word used to describe music devoid of any kind of artistic integrity, in my opinion. After watching the interviews on RBMA I felt it was necessary to at least write something that identified the origins of the genre and how Dubstep became an international phenomena. So I used extracts from the RBMA interviews and combined it with cultural theory and musicology to explain this, but to also to highlight why ""Classic Dubstep"" is a particularly special genre within the UK Underground Dance Music community.

People that have read it seemed to really enjoy it, I got a first for it in general and my supervisor commented saying it was ""culturally and academically relevant in it's own right."" But I'm also interested (and kinda scared) to see how an actual dubstep community will respond to it, well I hope.

So yeah, if you're interested in reading it send me a PM, if not, that's cool.

Cheers

Edit: Also this is what I was predominantly listening to when I wrote it:

Edit 2: Re-reading it now, and if it seems a little odd grammatically in places, it's because I had to seriously gut some areas to fit the word count.

Brief Intro: Youngsta began DJing at 12 and played his first pirate raido mix at 13. Hailing from Essex, you can catch him DJing for [Rinse.FM](http://rinse.fm/) on ""Minimal Mondays."" 

To me DJ Younsta IS dubstep. I'll give a few important reasons and elaborate on them. This is going to sound pretty fanboyish, because it is, consider me a major fan.

1\. His mixing style is flawless. I could write on essay on his style but to me the most important aspects he brings are: technicality, selection, and pace. 

Those who haven't heard need to listen, and not just background-music-listen. LISTEN. Hear that transition from song to song? Perfect. Feel the build up and the ""Youngsta implosion"". I am not an expert in mixing but it doesn't matter, that is part of his genius, even I can tell the difficulty and expertise he showcases while creating seemless mixes.

Too many dubstep artists / mixers completely miss the subtlety of dubstep - it doesn't have to be in-your-face to be exciting. It can be, but in the meantime a change of pace creates dynamic mixes. This is another one of DJ Youngsta's strengths. The mix can go from minimal and light then it builds and you can hear it's going somewhere else - suddenly a huge bass line collides and now you have some riddim forming. In 60 minutes DJ Youngsta can take a mix there and back, and it was just getting started.

2\. He has been here since the beginning and still puts out tracks and mixes. 

There are not very many people who can say they have been making dubstep since the beginning. His experience has only made him better and his producing is still top notch, and he still makes and plays dubplates. If anything, recognize the commitment to dubstep this guy has made. 

3\. Here are some of my favorite mixes and tunes:

1314331654.0	jus4c	Dear r/realdubstep	kbcc	55	22	22	"I've always loved music that had a lot of energy to it. Around September of 2000 at a local party a highschool friend of mine introduced me to The Crystal Method, and I instantly fell in love with the world of electronic dance music. My taste evolved around the whole spectrum. I sampled industrial, house, drum and bass, trance, breakbeat. You name it I wanted to hear it at least once. I started listening to what most purists would refer to as ""brostep"" around late 2010 listening to Nero, Skrillex, and Flux Pavilion. I loved it with a musical passion I hadn't felt since the first time I heard Trip Like I Do at that fateful house party. It was loud and energetic. And damn it, it did what music is supposed to do: it made me happy. I see a lot of hate on r/dubstep for the likes of Skrillex, Excision, and other producers of that sound that beats so far off the path from the music you would hear on this subreddit. This isn't about ""why the hate, brah?"" Thats not what I'm here for. But about a month ago I saw a link on r/dubstep directing to r/realdubstep. I've been listening to as much as I can in this month, and I find the overall sound enjoyable. Its not heavy and raucous like your modernized Electro-infused dubstep, but it has a beat to it that I can wholly enjoy. So I guess in short I want to say thanks for showing me the roots of what my current musical obsession comes from. Now I feel a little more musically enlightened, and happy that I can delight in both sides of the spectrum.

TL;DR I've always loved EDM, got into ""brostep"" in 2010, recently found r/realdubstep, enjoy both genres. Thanks for showing me. Peace, love, fuck the haters."	t5_2s9pu	True

**COPY PASTE FROM PLASTICIAN'S SOUNDCLOUD**

----
Yo! I've just uploaded a brand new tune to Soundcloud. I'm in the process of finishing up a few bits for an E.P. which will be on a grimy tip. I've got a few tracks that I started late last year which are in the process of getting finished up.

This could possibly be the last E.P. I produce under the Plastician alias. Moving forward as I'm trying to seperate what I do as a producer from what I do as a DJ. Anyone who has been listening to my radio show or came to see me play a show lately will know I've broadened my selection to incorporate all kinds of music that excites me. This has been going fantastically well and has invigorated me to produce music taking these new influences on board.

I'm working on some really fresh sounding stuff at other tempos currently which will definitely not be released under the Plastician alias. I've always been into the idea of things getting big for the right reasons. And although I take great pride in who I am and what I've achieved, what comes with this is a sense of blurred vision created by the hype that surrounds your brand. We live in a world where our every move is watched through the window of the internet. It's easy to get caught up in things we read about ourselves and I'm a major culprit for this. With so many followers on various networking sites, I want to strip it back to the old days. Producing under an alias will be like starting out fresh for me, meaning people will only be hearing the music and buying the music purely on merit as opposed to the fact I'm riding on past successes. I sometimes wonder if people are only listening to the music I make because my name is well known, so this alias thing is a bit like an experiment. As the music I'm working on currently doesn't really fit anywhere at the moment I feel it needs to mature naturally, just like my music did back in 2002 when it didn't really sit in with grime, or garage, or dubstep.

Also, as I've experienced from watching the movements of other producers onto pastures new, people come to expect a certain sound from you as a producer. When this sound changes, or matures - fans become upset that you're ""not sticking to your roots"" or ""selling out"". For whatever reason they give, they cannot conceive the fact that an artist may just wish to express themselves through other mediums. While it's easy for you all to reply now telling me to ""just do what you want to do"". It becomes increasingly difficult to do that. For some time my head was awash with negative energy from so many different sources that it became impossible to be productive. Essentially, producing under another alias will allow me to do exactly that - produce the music I want to produce without judgement based on the Plastician / Plasticman legacy.

While I won't rule out more Plastician productions in future, for now Plastician the DJ is going to continue concentrating on playing the music I love, and producing music under a seperate alias that attempts to bridge the gaps between all of the music I play, just as I always have, just without the expectancy of this sound to resemble something I produced 8 years ago.

So, with all that said..... Here is a new PLASTICIAN track called BLENZ. For those interested in hearing what I'm working on currently - I'm sure if you listen to my radio show you'll be hearing them soon enough (in some cases, already) - you just might not know they are by me!"	t5_2s9pu	True

&gt;a UK music genre that branched out from UKGarage in the early 00's and the same thing for our close relative Dubstep.
&gt;
&gt;Grime is generally around 140 beats per minute and constructed from ""different"" sounds that musically combine futuristic electronic elements and dark, guttural bass lines. 
&gt;
&gt;Grime takes from many genres including UKGarage, dancehall, hiphop &amp; also parts of Dubstep.

Grime normally has mc's and thats why i think you'll be interested in /r/grimeinstrumentals,

I somewhat recently ran across a couple Skream albums as well as Burial's Untrue album, and I'm plenty hooked by now.  Before that, it's been mostly European/symphonic/power metal for me.  I also like [the song Blue by Gemini](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcWzVUlrzdc&amp;feature=colike), since it's a little busier/upbeat while still remaining ""chill"", though I don't really care for any other of his stuff.

So my question is, can you recommend me more great dub/garage/2-step/what-have-you ""like"" Burial, but also music ""better"" than the Gemini stuff I linked (I'm still new to this, so the linked song might not be very popular here.  I apologize in advance if that's the case, feel free to show me the light.  I know there has to be music better than what I linked, it was just the best example of the ""mood"" I'm trying to find more of.)

Thanks guys!"	t5_2s9pu	True

I'm a big fan of the minimal, heady feel. Lots of space to let your mind wander as the music takes control. I've also been grooving hard to the more upbeat, tribals riddims, that still remain dark. I tried to incorporate a bit of both in my mix. Track list is in the link.  

Much love for r/realdubstep for bringing me back every day to discover new tunes. I hope you guys enjoy the mix as much as I do.

Deast	31	5	70	"I'm a DJ for Virginia Tech's radio station (http://www.wuvt.vt.edu/) and I am doing a show on the early days of Dubstep for our big fundraising drive this fall. I plan on starting with The Winstons' ""Amen Brother"" and tracing a path to modern dubstep (potentially ending with a slight bit of Brostep/Trap just to complete the journey). I definitely want to focus on the '98-'08 timeframe, though.

I've already got a couple tracks/artists set aside, including: El-B, Zed Bias, Skream, Benga, Burial, Coki, Distance, Kode 9, Digital Mystikz.

My problem is that during the beginnings of Dubstep, I was listening to Techno/Trance/Drum&amp;Bass, not so much UK Garage etc. I wasn't there for the beginning, I wasn't aware of Dubstep until '04-'05. Because of this, I'm not 100% certain on all the old must-play tracks.

Do you have any suggestions of must play tracks from the very early days? Dipping into D&amp;B or Garage is 120% ok and appreciated. I really want to paint a picture of where the genre came from. Thanks in advance for your help!


EDIT: Thanks for all the recommendations so far! The show is this Wednesday, 8:30pm - 10:00pm GMT. You can listen at http://www.wuvt.vt.edu/listenlive. Hopefully I won't disappoint! And keep the recommendations coming."	t5_2s9pu	True

* [Get tickets here on the Cable website](http://www.cable-london.com/event/get-darker2).

Full line up: 16Bit, Wilkinson, Coki, DJG, Calyx &amp; Teebee, Distance, Logistics, Nu:Tone, Silkie, Kromester B2B Dark Tantrums, Serum, Kasra, Foreign Concept, Von D, Darkside, DJ AMC. If I got any of the dubstep artists wrong, forgive me for my sins.

A lot of you may or may not know but we've been doing London /r/dnb meets for over a year now; this seems like the perfect opportunity to bridge the gap to get some of you lot out as well. We're a friendly bunch, always accepting of new people so come on down...the plan is usually drinks followed by club about 11 but that's up to the where the night takes us really..

##THE PLAN

Meet at the [Horniman, London Bridge](http://www.nicholsonspubs.co.uk/thehornimanathayslondonbridge/), 8.30pm on Friday. It's right on river front so if you head across the road after coming out at London Bridge find a side road that'll take you to the south bank path and it's right there. If you come through the Hay's Galleria (massive glass roofed arch building) it's on the right after you come out river side.

Chose this one cos it's on the river, has a proper outside bit and isn't the Shipwright's Arms where they were cunts to us last time about having a glass of tap water (with a proper drink! the wankers).

**My number is oh 7 nine two 1 one nine 1 four 6 3**, ring/text any time.

The only other dubstep artists that play all ages are Skrillex and Bassnectar and the like so even if Skream and Benga only play out 5 classic tunes it'll probably be the best I can do. Has anyone seen them live recently? Do they play good stuff still?

I understand there's a bit of a thing going on with dubstep at the moment, so on recommendation this is a crosspost to both [/r/dubstep](http://www.reddit.com/r/dubstep/comments/10vdab/tell_me_everything_you_know_about_dubstep_please/) and r/realdubstep. I don't mind discussion relating to the controversy of dubstep (it's pretty much obligatory at this point), but I'd much rather see posts made out of your passion and love for dubstep, than posts made to divide and one-up each other.

1319411751.0	lmhdb	I went to Skream + Benga, Joker at Terminal 5, NYC [10/22/11]	Gwohl	31	6	32	"Caught this gig last night at the last minute, and I'll tell you guys: it was *interesting*.

First, let me remark about the crowd: the overwhelming majority of attendees were under 21, and a sizable portion of that majority were definitely still in high school. I saw at least a dozen kids arguing with the bouncers after being kicked out for attempting to drink underage. These kids gave the venue hell, and I bet they will no longer be hosting all-ages dubstep shows in the future. There were a lot of rave skanks and girls dressed in slutty Halloween costumes (meaning: lots of PLUR people were about), and a fair amount of bros wearing bro shades and acting all bro-like. Of course, drugs were everywhere. A few friendly college kids from New Jersey offered me (and I gladly accepted) many hand-rolled ""cigarettes"" and a few ""pills of ecstasy'"", which made the lame warm-up acts more enjoyable, and the attendees less offensive.

For this reason, it was entirely unsurprising to see that all of the madness Joker dropped on the stage was largely under-appreciated. When Joker dropped a dubplate of his remix of James Blake - Limit To Your Love there were no resounding cheers from the audience. When Skream dropped some pop song, with a four-to-the-floor groove, on the other hand, the crowd lit up.

Joker blew the warm-up acts (one electro house guy, and another who did Moombathton - was actually impressed by some of the tunes he dropped) out of the water. He also had a far more interesting and energetic set than Skream + Benga did. He appears to be far better than both of them with respect to DJing technique; the fades and mixes he did were unbelievably creative and clean Joker played a number of his own tunes - most of which, to my knowledge, are unreleased - and dropped some old school vibes in there too. He did not play anything off of his new release except for ""Tron."" 

Skream + Benga, were joined by Sgt. Pokes, and they were all really having fun up on that stage. It was cool to see these two in action finally (last time I saw Skream, and only Skream, was at Dub War NYC many years ago), however the set was luckluster for me. A lot of nameless wobble dubs and 4-to-the-floor carried the set along, but there were a few highlights to speak of... a few unreleased Coki tracks in addition to Goblin, about 30 seconds of a really heavy Goth Trad tune (don't recall the name of it), and a really awesome sub-bassy remix of What You Talkin About by Ms Dynamite.

All in all, I had fun at these sets, but I also learned a few important things about the 'dubstep' scene these days: If Skream and Benga are playing gigs all over the place like they did in New York, then they're not playing a lot of actual 'dubstep' anymore. I'd say half of the set was dubstep, and much of it verged into the territory of 'brostep' in nature. A couple of house and pop songs made it into their mix as well, which confused me. Perhaps this was a bit of a fluke considering it was a highlight of the CMJ festival happening here in NYC, and appeared to have been a part of some sort of promoted Halloween-style party that was happening at a few clubs throughout the city. But the steep $45 admission was well worth it just for the hour and a half set by Joker. That man is going to go far - he's got an enormous amount of talent and style for someone his age, and has a very unique, fun, humorous sound not just in his own tunes, but in his DJ sets as well. He's definitely a class act."	t5_2s9pu	True
