1365032371.0	1bmh1c	How do you think Marvel should continue when an actor is done playing a superhero role?	BasherTarr	47	3	59	"For example, Im glad we're getting a lot of RDJ as Tony Stark, and Im sure he'll stick around for quite a while, but Im sure at some point way way in the future, he will likely move on because he's either too old or simply done playing Stark.

Personally, I dont think they should go the reboot route. I think they should start treating the roles like they treat James Bond. Simply pass down the role of Tony Stark to a new actor. I know it will be impossible to top the performance that RDJ delivers to the character, but I would love to see Iron Man live on in some form or another and it could always be cool to see a new actor's take on it, even if it will never compare to RDJ.

The same goes for other heroes. I hope they simply keep the Marvel movies continuing in the same universe for years to come, but whenever an actor feels like theyre done for whatever reason, they go on and choose the next person to take up the mantle. It could be tricky to pull off, but Marvel has been really good at this stuff so far in my opinion. "	t5_2qx71	True

Neither will ever meet Spider-Man, and none of the aforementioned three franchises will ever have anything to do with the Avengers.	nousername215	42	13	48	"Reason for this is business. Fox owns the rights to the X-Men and Fantastic Four franchises, and can do whatever they want with them. Sony owns the rights to Spider-Man, and nothing else Marvel related, so crossovers with X-Men and the Fantastic Four won't happen. Disney/Marvel Studios have everything else, which is why the MCU can be as expansive as it is and is getting.

Now, I guess these crossovers could happen if the studios involved decided to work together and share profits, but the result would be bickering over whose characters get screen time, how profits are shared, how costs are shared, what the collaboration and crossover would mean for future movies, etc. There's no foreseeable deal to make everyone happy, and as such, probably won't happen. 

I really only made this post because it seems like a lot of folks don't know this, and call for crossovers to happen that just can't and won't because of business.

1375553580.0	1jmxml	How I'd like to see an Aquaman movie, and some cohesive DC continuity.	guyincape25	29	3	5	"I recently started writing down my own thoughts for an Aquaman movie. I think it would be great to really showcase the character. Aquaman does have some serious fans, but I think it is safe to say that as long as a re-imagined character was done well, nobody would complain.

Now I hope people can add, take away, whatever. These are just some thoughts. But I think it would be great to get a more cohesive DC movie universe. I fucking love these characters!

I was thinking it would be cool if he had more of a mystery origin, starting off being found by his father, who would be black and would be working as a fisherman and the maintenance guy for a light house in South Africa. I think it would be cool for him to have a young black son, no mother, and just have the three of them together. As Arthur Curry grows up, he becomes close with his older brother, until they lose their father in a storm.

I think the scene would be quite dramatic, and ultimately end with Arthur, at 12-14 and his brother a bit older, being unable to save their father. His older brother would be angry with him and unable to stay with Arthur, blaming him for their father's death.

Fast forward several years. Arthur is working on an anti-whaling ship that operates in the South China Sea and the surrounding area. He has extremely heightened swimming abilities, is incredibly strong, and always has a keen sense of where the whales they are tracking are. He keeps pushing the limits of his abilities, figuring out how deep he can swim, and starts to learn that he is far from ordinary. He uses these abilities to continue protecting the ocean and he tries to figure out his origin. He gets on the right track to figuring out his origin and finds strong inclinations towards the Atlantean idea.

Cue in some character development, self-loathing about his father's death, etc. A massive drilling and whaling campaign looks to destroy the entire Asian coast. The close watcher notices the rigs have Lexcorp written on them.

In another developing story line we see the development of a foil character. He robs top secret Lexcorp tech which gives him deepsea diving abilities, as well as augmented strength. He uses the tech to perform acts of eco terrorism, this includes the planned destruction of Lexcorp rigs.

Eventually Arthur crosses paths with the eco terrorist. Grudge match ensues. In their first encounter Arthur learns that his enemy, who the news has been referring to as ""Black Manta"" due to the appearance of his suit, is actually his brother. He is still angry and blames Arthur for their father's death, which Arthur also feels guilty for. Arthur tries to convince him that they are brothers despite his hatred, but Manta despises Arthur too much and has created his entire life around getting revenge.

Arthur eventually defeats (in a vague, we wonder if he died sort of way) Black Manta, he stops a massive disaster from happening, but the importance of protecting the ocean still hangs in the balance. He uncovers that Lexcorp was paying the whalers as a distraction and the rigs were actually looking for the source of a strange energy pattern under the South China Sea. This is actually a portal to Atlantis. The movie ends with a giant whirlpool enveloping the rig, and Arthur standing from afar watching as a massive city arises from the depths.

After the credits we see a run down bar somewhere on the African coast. A drink comes down on the bar. We pan up and it is Black Manta, obviously not in his suit. He is watching the news cast about the new floating city, speculated to be the lost city of Atlantis. Into the bar walks a person who we only see from the bottom. They are wearing very expensive shoes, a suit, as the camera pans up we see Black Manta's face with a blank expression. Now we see from a further back view, the back of the head of a bald man standing in front of him. He says ""You took something that belongs to me. So you owe me a favor.""

From what I understand, his healing power was something that was already there prior to his time in Weapon X, so it's not something that they ""did"" to him. I could be wrong, but I always thought the Healing/Bone Claws were before Weapon X, and the Adamantium obviously came after.

I'm a huge fan of X-Men, it's stories and characters alike so as much as I'll try to avoid it, this might end up being sort of a biased review- as in what I liked and didn't like, not necessarily what the facts are. If this is the case, I apologise in advance. Also, I posted this in r/movies like 5 hours ago and there isn't much movement there so hopefully you guys are more switched on haha. 

Without further ado, here we go!

Title - The Wolverine
Director - James Mangold
Starring - Hugh Jackman, Tao Okamoto, Rila Fukushima, Hiroyuki Sanada, Will Yun Lee and Svetlana Khodchenkova.

Lets start off with...

The Good:

-Hugh Jackman: I believe this is Mr Jackman's best performance as the Clawed Canadian to date. He truly captures the sadness, rage, power and ferocity that his character possesses. Through Mangold's direction of course, he finally 'reacts' to what is happening to him. For example, when he gets hurt, we see that he is affected by this for some time. In addition, particularly at the beginning, his sadness and loneliness is felt throughout the first act in a very even fashion. I would love to go on about Hugh's performance but we'd be here for days. Onwards!

-Tao Okamoto: This lovely young actress absolutely shines as Mariko. She reminds me precisely of her comic book counterpart. Even though we didn't get to see a lot of on-screen romance between her and Logan exclusively, what we DID see was gorgeous and in my opinion, very believable. 

-Rila Fukushima: Reading up on her, I see that she hasn't done a lot of acting, but she was awesome as Yukio. She was cunning, intelligent and deadly. But very sweet at the same time. Awesome performance.

-The first act: With this, I'm referring to everything up until Logan boards the plane for the first time with Yukio. I loved everything about the first act. From the flashback scene, to the bar scene and even the scene with the bear (while very sad, it was really cool to see Logan being compassionate with an animal)

-The action: Apart from a few calm scenes and a few more romantic scenes, this film was jam-packed with action. Running, slashing, slicing and dicing, stabbing and hitting...it was all there! Awesome to see.

-Set design: I loved every set this film had to offer. From the traditional Japanese compounds, to the street-scape of downtown Japan. Very cool.

-The bullet train sequence: Love. Love. Loved it! Prior to watching the film, I read somewhere that this sequence was tacky, useless to the plot and the CG wasn't convincing. I found it to be the opposite on all accounts. It showed how much of a superhuman Logan actually is.

-The loss of healing: Ever since the first trailer came out and I found out Logan was going to 'lose his powers', I was a little devastated. I sat there wondering how they would handle it. But it flowed, and didn't hinder the story at all. In addition, during the scene just before Logan and Mariko stumble upon the pit that Logan and Yashida hid in, Mariko asks Logan, 'what's wrong?' and Logan replies, 'I'm tired'. This was subtle yet I got a real sense of the toll this was taking on Logan.

-The post-credits scene: YES! FINALLY the two are connected! For a long time, the X-Men series and Wolverine have kind of been separate but finally they are intertwining to come together in Days of Future Past. As soon as I saw the 'Trask Industries' logo, I squealed. I actually thought it was going to be Magneto somehow crafting new claws for Logan using the adamantium Logan ripped off the mech suit during the film, but I'm more than happy with this!


Now to the not so good...

-The Viper: Now don't get me wrong, her acting was fine but I just found her character to be weak and under-developed, not to mention a little useless to the plot at times. She would just disappear at random moments and when she popped up again, her whereabouts weren't explain. That kind of annoyed me. On the plus side, she is very beautiful.

-Yashida: Apart from the flashback scenes which I thought were very good, the rest of the character's screen time was a bit...bland. Even when he showed up towards the end, I didn't gasp in shock. I wasn't emotionally invested in his character, and I felt like I should of been.

-The mech suit: I'm aware that Silver Samurai DOES have a mech suit in the comics, but this one felt too...transformer-like. It didn't feel organic and I didn't believe Yashida's drive to use it.

-The regular SS suit: I was very annoyed at this. All we got was a few glimpses of the regular armour and then a nightmare sequence where we see the armour in use. We didn't get a Wolverine vs. Silver Samurai fight scene...not REALLY.

-Jean Grey's presence: From the trailers, I got the impression that the first dream sequence would be the only time we saw Jean, and I was more than happy with that. Instead, we had to see her every 20 minutes, trying to lure Logan into dying so that he could 'be with her'. I found myself saying 'Goddamn it woman, leave the man alone!'

-The loss of the adamantium claws: Since walking out of the cinema, I've been on the fence about this arc. But I don't think I like it. It's kind of tacky and just saddening. Maybe I'm just being a bitch about it.

Kind of anxious to see how Logan gets his adamantium claws back, but it's X-Men...something awesome will happen and I'll love it.

I honestly believe the combination of First Class, The Wolverine and Days of Future Past with revitalise the X-Men franchise and will start giving us the X-Men films we deserve!

All in all though, I thought it was an amazing movie and I would personally give it an 8 out of 10.

1353609471.0	13mpa2	How I believe a Justice League move could work with Nolanverse Batman	connorjquinn	21	6	25	"I've been aching to discuss this with fellow fans, so share your thoughts after reading please!

My idea for the JLA movie would include all the DC movies that have come out in recent years (Nolan Batman, Green Lantern) and obviously Man of Steel coming out next summer. Though Green Lantern came out before TDKR I would set it after all the batman movies. Basically, it starts with Bruce Wayne in Europe hearing about Superman, Green Lantern and other superheroes popping up all over U.S. and naturally, he is distrustful of all of them, but mostly of superman, because he is an alien and is essentially a god and the whole world really has no means of stopping him. As a result, Bruce decides to come back to the U.S. and be Batman again (this is assuming John Blake doesn't become Batman, but a Nightwingish character I guess). Then Batman confronts Superman and has a confrontation of some kind verbally or physically. Superman reveals to Batman that his father Jor-El warned Supes about Brainiac surviving/causing the death of his planet Krypton and that he is coming to Earth to do the same, Batman reluctantly agrees to work with him for the greater good, and they unite with Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, and whatever other Heroes they decide to include. I think having The Flash and Aquaman be the final team membesr would be fine, since I think they're the core 6 that most people have heard of, then they could further increase the size of the League as the universe expands.  But yeah then they unite, fight, etc. 

I know most people will say Aliens and stuff doesn't fit with Nolan Batman blah blah blah. But I think people need to remember, it's a comic book movie at it's core, and really there are no limitations, the fact that it's a superhero movie lends to that. Also people need to realize that even in the animated series' Batman and Superman's worlds were drastically different, Gotham was grim and the villains were more ""realistic"" and Superman was more fantastical dealing with more alien esque threats and they still crossed over.

I'm not completely against a complete reboot of Batman for justice league, I just think for the sake of the movie's success, I think keeping the characters that already exist would help a lot. I personally would love to see Nolan's Batman kicking the crap out of Superman i.e Batman vs. Superman, just because Batman is so grounded, the contrast in character would make their relationship even better. Also since Man of Steel is going with a similar tone as Batman Begins, why not just keep that tone throughout the JUstice League and just keep the character that started it all? 

Well there's how I think it should go! I know a lot of what I said isn't necessarily mirroring the comics exactly, but i think it works with the cards we've been dealt. Share your comments/thoughts!

1356705907.0	15knr5	The Ultimate Comic Book Movie Game...has never been beaten in over four years. (x-post from /r/comicbooks)	Beeslo	16	4	27	"**The object of the game is similar to most movie games or 6 degrees of separation from Kevin Bacon. My friend and I realized that comic book movies are so prevalent nowadays, that its impossible for an actor nowadays to not be connected to a comic book movie either directly or through another actor. So your objective, if you should choose to accept it is: within one degree of separation (or less), name an actor or actress that isn't connected to a comic book movie.**

*Example: Meg Ryan. Meg Ryan was in You Got Mail with Tom Hanks who was in Road to Perdition (which was based off of a graphic novel).*

Rules:

(1) Actor has to have been active since 1960. No Judy Garland answers.

(2) Actor has to have been in a movie as recently as 1980.

(3) Actor has to have been in at least two mainstream movies.

(4) No actors that are only found in obscure foreign or independent movies, unless they later have broken out into at least two main stream movies.

(5) Actor has to have been born no later than 1999. No five year old actors, essentially.

(6) Movies have to be theatrically released movies. No direct to DVD or made for TV movies. TV shows also don't count.

(7) Animated movies don't count as well since they are typically big ensemble casts and the actors typically don't interact with each other that much during the making of them.

(8) Documentaries don't count either, this includes music movies like Justin Bieber's ""Never Say Never"" movie. The reason behind this is so that someone can't use Justin Bieber as their answer to win since he really hasn't acted in a movie. Also, cameo appearances are fine but only if the cameo is playing a character, not themselves.

(9) ""Comic book movie"" is essentially any movie that is based off a property that is a comic or graphic novel. Manga and anime DO NOT count. Despite its influences, Scott Pilgrim is a comic book movie. Also despite being autobiographical, American Splendor also counts.

(10) Actor's filmography can't be comprised of simply extra work. They have to have at least two minor roles in their filmography. Simply put, if all their roles are ""man (or woman) blah blah blah"", its safe to say that their name doesn't count.

**My friend and I have been playing this game for four years and it still hasn't been beaten and I have determined that its impossible to beat. I'm so confident in this fact, that I am giving Reddit Gold to anyone that can beat it.**

Judgment of winner will be determined by myself but I will most likely take consensus from you all as well."	t5_2qx71	True

What direction would you like the film to go in?

Personally, I'd like WB to stray away from the mindless popcorn flick because I think Marvel's Avengers nailed that in a way that JL would fail to mimic. I think it should be more character-oriented and more mature in its themes. It should be about a group of individuals who realize they have to accept a greater responsibility; people who are just trying to acclimate into a society that's adopted them that they need to fight for.

As far as the heroes go...

SUPERMAN would basically be an orphaned alien who looks and sounds human, but knows that he isn't. He's been adopted by Earth and the threat posed by the JL movie villain is threatening the only home he has left so he is stricken with this almost obsessive fear that it will be destroyed like Krypton. This brings out the heroic leader in him.

BATMAN becomes embroiled in the global threat and actually inadvertently gets drawn into the league because he's skeptical of this association of super-powered demigods and wants to be close to them to essentially spy on them and ensure that they're not a threat to the world. He's extremely skeptical of Superman and would constantly be at odds with him, in both action and philosophy.

WONDER WOMAN is drawn into the conflict when her Amazonian sisters realize that the threat to Earth is the perfect time to send her into Man's world and help save it so that the two worlds can be bridged, with WW acting as an ambassador. She's a pure warrior; the best fighter on the team.

MARTIAN MANHUNTER, like Superman, is an orphan and the last of his kind, bonding him to Superman in many ways. He fears that the villain will destroy Earth the way his home, Mars, was destroyed.

AQUAMAN would come to the surface to warn the world of the forces that are gathering against it. He helps to unite the members of the League because he has a keen insight on the villain(Ocean Master? Black Manta?) and what he wants.

FLASH doesn't want to be involved in the League. His powers were given to him against his will(the lightning/chemical accident in his forensics lab) and he views the gift of super-speed as a curse. He has to be convinced that his ""curse"" is actually providence.

GREEN LANTERN has recently been inducted into the GL Corps and the JL movie would be his first assignment to protect his home world. He feels the weight of his responsibility and is dead-set at fulfilling his responsibility as guardian of his home sector.

VILLAIN: When I first thought about a JL movie I figured that the villain would have to be someone like Darkseid; some cosmic force that comes from space, then The Avengers came out and pretty much delivered on that. I figure that the threat to Earth should come from Earth for the JL movie. 

Maybe Ocean Master or Black Manta decides to raise a force to decimate the surface world, Aquaman becomes the catalyst for uniting the members of the league with Superman in the lead, and they have to stop a rogue Atlantean threat from the sea. It'd be an interesting visual to have these massive warships rising out of the oceans and closing in on coastal cities like Gotham and Metropolis.

There's probably even more graphic stuff that I'm forgetting, but seriously Kick-Ass 2 is a hell of a lot darker than the original and it doesn't even get a nice story book happy ending.  How true to the comic do you think they'll be?  Will the studios make them leave anything out for the sake of not being overly graphic?    The trailers seem to show that it'll follow the comic pretty closely, but what do you lot think?	t5_2qx71	True

First, I would have killed off Happy in the explosion. He isn't that interesting, and I felt like it would have motivates Tony more if his bodyguard died chasing a lead he dismissed as a waste of time.

Secondly, I would have cut out that entire section with the kid and the military guy. I felt like it was a really slow part of the film, and didn't really establish anything. Sure the villian's minions chased him, but they could have done something more productive with that amount of time. They could have explained Pearce's motives and goals, which is my third complaint.

I felt like the AIM guy's plan was not explained well enough. Did he want to kill the president and take over America by using the vice president? Did he want Stark to work for him to fix the formula? Why did he care about the formula? Did he want to fix people or turn them into weapons?

Also I think the president should have died...

The ending really disappointed me. I didn't understand why Tony had surgery to remove the shrapnel, I thought the whole point was that they couldn't remove it so the next best thing was to use a magnet. Really bummed me out.

Anyway, these are my thoughts on the movie. I still liked it, I just wish it had been done better.

And as I was rewatching The Amazing Spider-man, I was thinking about the criticisms of the stories plot and handling of Dr. Connors character. Particularly that we didn't feel sympathetic towards him because they didn't show his family, etc.

But when I watched the movie, I did feel sympathy for him, not because of what was in the movie, but my knowledge of the characters *outside* of the film. My brain ""filled in"" the gaps of the things that weren't there, thus making it a more enjoyable film for me. 

I think we, as avid fans of all of these characters, we tend to notice things that may not really be there. The biggest example is all of the ""easter eggs"" in TDKR (Deadshot, killer croc). 

I just was interested to see if anyone else has experienced/thought about this at all and am in the mood for some discussion!

Keep in mind that its the first attempt, and that I'm by no means a professional screen writer. I just though it would be fun to write out an opening scene, and I've got no intention of going anywhere with this.

Let me know what you think, and feel free to throw around any ideas of how you think the JLA movie should go. 

Also I wouldn't mind some screenwriting criticism if anybody has some, I'm still learning and I'd love some feedback."	t5_2qx71	True

I'm not sure when people started lining up, but by the time I arrived at 4, it was already around the block. Later on, a good hundred or so people were behind me. The fan event began at 5:30 where Hugh Jackman made an appearance. Before I go any further I have to say that Hugh is without a doubt the nicest celebrity I've ever met. He sincerely appreciates his fans and showed it at the event. The appearance was split between two stages, one indoor and one outdoor in a covered area. I was fortunate enough to be in the outdoor as this seemed to be the focal point and more effort put into the staging/appearance. As he was walking to the stage, he stopped for as many pictures and signings as he could, then afterwards, once he met with the press on the red carpet, he came back around and stayed for quite a long time to make sure everyone left happy. So long that the host was doing a raffle, camera crews were breaking down, and low and behold Hugh is still signing away. Speaking of which, I was one number off for the movie poster raffle and my friend was one number off from a boxed set signed by Hugh, I just needed to vent that out again. Once the fan event was finished, we were led out to the theater for the film. Free popcorn, various theater sized candy and bottled water were handed out as we entered. Without spoiling anything I will say that this Wolverine movie was great, and it is the movie people have been wanting for some time. Absolutely redeems itself from that Origins movie I pretend didn't happen. If you are a fan, I highly recommend it. You will not be disappointed with this one. 

Here's a link to a gallery I uploaded with pics from the event for those interested:

First of all, how does Wolverine remember Nagasaki?

What in the fuck was the point of Viper in that movie? What was she even trying to do?

Not important, but when Wolverine loses his power, there were no wounds in his hands where his claws come out.

There were too many random Japanese guys with no character development whatsoever

Isn't the Silver Samurai just a mutant who can charge his sword with energy? I really did not like the whole Silver Samurai part of the movie

Also, does anyone actually care about Wolverine-Jean Grey relationship in the movies? They did not have a lot of interaction in the the first two movies. It felt really forced."	t5_2qx71	True

It just feels unnatural and pretty much ruins the chance of that character making a reappearance in any appropriate way.

1366964460.0	1d55ti	Iron Man 3 Review [SPOILERS]	pharaoh94	10	8	20	"So as most of you know, the third installment of the Iron Man franchise was released here in Australia (as well as a few European countries) earlier than the rest of the world.

Before any of you jump at the chance to attack me, I'm aware many reviews have been posted already and those of you who feed on spoilers already know what happens in this film.

However, I'd just like to add my two cents. Before I continue, I'd like to say once again that SPOILERS are bound to unwrap in the following text.

Now to the review:

I'd like to start off by stating that although an avid Marvel comic book reader and fan, I don't know everything about the Armoured Avenger.
However, having read up on The Avengers and Civil War (among other series') I'd like to think I have a fair understanding of the character along with his allies and foes.

The good:
-Tony's personality = Although he still keeps his trademark sense of humour, Tony seems to have matured up a bit since New York. He's much more collected and fluent in the way he addresses people as opposed to the severe arrogance shown in the previous films. His responsibility as Iron Man has allowed him to see things in a more proper light; including Pepper. Which leads me to...

-Tony and Pepper's relationship =  Tony and Pepper have grown into a full fledged couple which is lovely to see on screen. I feel like Robert and Gwyneth have a real chemistry which translates well both in the times of romance and action alike. Pepper has moved in with Tony, which puts a little strain on Tony's ego at times but has otherwise improved their relationship.

-Happy Hogan = Jon Favreau shines this time around as Pepper's head of security. I feel as though he wasn't very well written in the previous films but this one gives him a lot of freedom to input his own flavour of comedy relief. All until, of course, he's hospitalised; which while immensely tragic, gives Tony the motivation he needs to go after The Mandarin.

-Iron Patriot = I was anxious to see how they would handle Iron Patriot and his name/colour change but I liked how they justified it by using very patriotic reasoning. It was cool.

-The Air Force One scene = This was handled, dare I say, with genius. It was fast paced, smart, well written and directed - just an all round awesome scene. Loved it

-The way the Iron Man suits open = I know this is minor but it's just awesome to see. Tony's suit was supposed to 'unfold' like that in Iron Man 2, but the sequence was cut due to funds going to CGI.

-Failing suits = Although very unfortunate for Tony at times, it provides a little light hearted comedy to the situation at hand. The Mk 42 is still brand new so its bound to still have its bugs and flaws. The way that's handled is very cool.

-Tony's anxiety attacks = Since the events of Iron Man 1, Tony is considered to be almost robotic due to the arc reactor in his chest. The anxiety attacks give him much more of a human side that 
a) hasn't been seen in a while and 
b) gives us something to relate to (I think).

Now to the not so good:

-Extremis = EDIT: I've read up some more on the Extremis virus so I apologise to those I misinformed or offended. According to the Extremis Story arc, I found that it was handled well throughout the film.

-The time Tony and Rhodey spent in their respective suits was just - all I can say is :(. The film shows a lot of situations  where Tony and James are kicking arse as themselves, but not as their armoured counterparts; which is kind of lame to be honest.

-Ellen Brandt = I found this character, while interesting in the comics, is horribly written and acted in the film and is pretty useless.

-Harley = While the conversations he and Tony had provided a fair amount of the comic relief throughout the second act, his place in the film as a whole felt a little random. It was like we were expected to have remembered him from Ton'y past adventures and now were catching up to him; but really, we don't know anything about him other than his father is gone and his mother works constantly. I don't know, I just didn't love the character.

-The Mandarin = This character has been mentioned in a lot of reviews so I'll just sound like a broken record here so forgive me.
The Mandarin is supposed to be one of Tony Stark's most lengthy and dangerous threats. He's meant to be calculating, cold, menacing and full of tyranny. Instead, in the film, he's a drunken British actor who was offered drugs and alcohol to pose as the world's most dangerous villain.
Um...what?
In the film, as some of you know, the characters of Aldrich Killian and The Mandarin were somewhat merged together to form a threat against Iron Man. This was not handled correctly IMO. I would've loved it if there was no Killian, and The Mandarin was an actual real, dangerous threat to Iron Man. Unfortunately though, I didn't get that.

So there you have it. A very honest, blunt review of Iron Man 3. Hope you enjoyed the read!"	t5_2qx71	True

* Green Lantern: Kyle Rayner. Obviously I'm assuming they don't go with the movie, which to be perfectly honest wasn't the horror fest everyone says it is. They could just use the Superman: TAS origin.

Alternatively, Simon Baz if they want to keep the old Green Lantern movie canon, and just say Hal died protecting his sector or something, have the whole terrorist being hunted by the Justice League, but the bomb was actually one of Darkseid's boom tubes."	t5_2qx71	True

Kadie's bar will probably play a prominent role in the movie as a hub-like area where characters will cross paths (especially with the news Alba's Nancy will be doing more dancing in this movie), so a Shellie replacement seems likely.

After watching Iron Sky this last week, I think [Julia Dietze](http://www3.pictures.gi.zimbio.com/1+1+2+Knights+Premiere+jVePX6oUZ2Bl.jpg) could be a decent replacement. If she could get an american accent down I reckon she'd do well.

As you know, for about 60% of the film, Logan is without his healing factor. During that period he pops out his claws several times, and when he pops them back in, *he has no holes between his knuckles.* I'm sure in one of the previous X-men movies, there was a shot of Wolverine popping his claws back into his fist, and there are little holes where each claw came out of. Those holes just closed up because of his healing factor. But in the Wolverine,  there were a few shots where after Logan popped his claws back inside, you saw his completely fine knuckles. I know this was probably not on purpose and the film producers probably just didn't want to spend more money on make-up/special effects to make the holes, just thought I should share this minor plot hole which bothered me more than it should have.

**TL;DR**: When wolverine is without his healing factor and pops his claws in there should have been holes in his knuckles. There wern't."	t5_2qx71	True

1376611916.0	1kgeca	So, this is a ponderance related to Marvel movies/comics that I can't find any information on.	Mongostein	1	1	3	"So, Marvel owns the movie rights to The Avengers, Fox owns the movie rights to X-men and Fantastic 4, and Sony owns the movie rights to Spider-man.

Now, there's this whole thing with Quicksilver going on, where he's going to appear in the next Avengers and X-men movie, played by different actors, and not being the same character, yet still being the same character. This is apparently ok, because he's been both an Avenger and an X-man in the comics.

So, what I'm wondering is: What's to stop Marvel from just using their own X-men (or Spider-man) characters in future Avengers movies?

Can Marvel just use:
Beast
Wolverine
Spider-man
Storm
Rogue
Havok
Banshee
Any of the Fantastic 4 (because they've all been Avengers at some point)
and anyone else I missed

In an Avengers movie and just say, ""Fuck you, they're Avengers, dickweeds""? And in the future, simply write whatever characters they want to use in a movie in to an Avengers comic so they can put them in said movie?"	t5_2qx71	True

I thought there might be some significance to the this number. First, we have the reference to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, where 42 is ""The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything"".

But I think there's also significance if you take 'Mk.' for the Book of Mark. While there aren't 42 chapters in the book, Mark 1 deals with Jesus curing a leper. Mark 1:42 reads ""Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed"". This could be a reference to Iron Man ridding himself of his artificial heart at the end of the movie, casting aside the source of his disease (which was a major theme in IM2). Also there's the whole superhero as Jesus metaphor, which isn't really explicit or endemic to the Iron Man series, but which is a recurring idea in many comic books."	t5_2qx71	True

I mean at least thematically there could be some correlation of the Justice League with very old mythology. This has been discussed before as far as the comics are concerned and I also think that if the DC Universe is gonna use the Nolan-tone for their movies, this is going to fit right in anyway. Batman is Hades and Superman is Zeus. Green Lantern is Apollo and Wonder Woman is Athena. The Injustice game seems to be hinting at this with the subtitle: Gods Among Us. 

This would also be quite different indeed from the Marvel movies tone-wise and also could lead into a Kingdom Come type movie as there is no shortage of reference to the Bible and other mythology in that book as well.

IanMazgelis	2	3	1	"It's established that Superman has been protecting Metropolis for two years now, and that he's built an antagonist in Lex Luthor. Meanwhile, Clark Kent is working well at the Daily Planet with Lois, Perry, and Jimmy. Luthor gets a notice from his doctor that he has cancer. 

Eventually, Brainiac shows up, responding to Luthor's signal, and demands that Kal-El return the Codex to him, insisting that it's stolen knowledge of Krypton. Kal grows weary of Brainiac, and attempts to bring diplomacy, but Brainiac lashes out, revealing that the Codex was built by Brainiac shortly before Krypton's destruction. Brainiac offers Superman time to consider returning the Codex, while secretly preparing Earth for its knowledge to be harvested. Luthor, having secretly taken one of Kal's cells, learns that the codex WAS created by Brainiac, but only before he destroyed Krypton, which could have survived for weeks or even months had he not destroyed it prematurely. Luthor then dawns his power suit, built from Zod's armor, and goes to destroy Brainiac. Superman stops him and insists that he at least help. At Brainiac's skull ship, Luthor is nearly killed, so Superman heads the fight while Luthor hijacks and destroys Brainiac's equipment, resulting in them destroying him. Luthor later insists that this changes nothing between them.

There's an after credits scene of Luthor bench pressing over 200kg, when a doctor walks in and interrupts that Luthor's second cancer test came back negative. Luthor snaps the bar and half and jumps up, then laughs triumphantly and thanks the doctor."	t5_2qx71	True
