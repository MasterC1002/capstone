1366613893.0	1cun3p	Why high schoolers are hard to please	the_bigwiggle	189	16	71	"There have been a few posts in the past about why it sucks to play high school dances and other events for teenagers.  I have done quite a few high school dances with great success but, I have access to what many others don't... three teenage daughters.  These three girls have wildly varying tastes in music but, they are a wealth of information for me.  I don't generally ask them outright about what music they like, but I instead listen for what they are listening to in their rooms, or I take a look at our rhapsody account to see what is getting played.

By and large, these kids will only listen to what is currently hot in any genre that they choose to listen to.  They also don't listen to much EDM except for the stuff being played on the radio.  And yes, I have caught all three of them playing levels over and over again.

This was further evidenced by a statement that my daughter made today concerning her prom.  When I asked her how it went, she said the prom was good but, the music ""sucked because the DJ kept playing stuff from 2010"".  She said the dance floor was at best moderately packed all night.  

Her statement is very telling.  When playing in bars and clubs, We as DJs, can get away with dropping music from a wide variety of time periods because adults have experienced music from a wide variety of time periods.  

Kids on the other hand don't begin to develop their own musical identity until around the onset of puberty.  Before that, the music they hear is largely controlled by those people around them.  When you look back on your life, chances are, you will associate a soundtrack to go with those memories.  Music makes and enhances memories.  

To teenagers, those memories are being made right now in the moment.  They correlate music with new and exciting experiences that are happening to them now.  Music that happened even just a couple years back is not ""their"" music.  To them, those are somebody else's memories.  Of course, there are exceptions.  I can still fill a dance floor with California Love or Lil John's ""Get Low"" but by and large, I only play music less than a year old.  I have never once received a request for the Black Eyed Peas, S&amp;M by Rihanna, or anything else hot just a couple years ago at a high school dance.

So, go into these gigs with an open mind, and don't get caught up in trying to play what you consider to be ""good music"".  Play popular music because to your audience, that is ""good music"".  By doing this, you would be helping these kids make memories that will last a lifetime and, you will also increase your bookings.  Also, go easy on the remixes and, a little scratching will make you DJ Royalty to these kids.

1340769509.0	vo2f4	Rant: So these guys show up on my dancefloor, and tell me the owner has asked me to give them a set...	Kasyx	188	26	182	"So I'm a resident at a local club, and last Friday night these two guys show up on my dancefloor, laptops in tow. Apparently the owner has told them that I will give them a set, and decide whether they can play more regularly. Considering I seem to be the only EDM DJ around, and playing for 8 hours a night is exhausting, I take them up on their offer.

""What decks do you use?"" I ask tentatively.

""Oh, we just use our laptops...""

*sigh*

""Of course you do..."" At this point I'm already somewhat indifferent, yet I further the conversation, jumping to an understandable conclusion, ""Are you using Virtual DJ?"".

""Nah, man; we're using Windows Media Player.""

Windows. Media. Player.

Not only can these guys not be arsed to learn a ""DJ"" program as simple as VDJ, but they can't even use a decent media player, instead choosing to go with whatever came stock: ""Hey, bro! Our new DJ laptop totally just arrived, dudebro! I'm not sure what software to use, broman brosefstein,  but it looks like this Windows Media Player came pre-loaded! Score, bro bro macbroferton!""

Fucking fuck.

So, against my better judgement, I decided to let them play for an hour. There was no hint of mixing. They literally played one track after the other, with a pause in-between as they furiously double-clicked to the next track. 

But hey, most people don't give a shit as long as you drop Levels, which they did. Three times. In an hour. So at least they had a bit of a crowd going.

Their crowning achievement, however, was not their pre-planned Media Player playlist (which actually made their presence behind the laptop completely moot), but rather the fact that they were using my mixer to ""mix"" the EQ - one of the guys even had my headphones on.

Am I angry that they used my stuff without even asking? 

Well, I guess I would be, if any of it had even been switched on...

That's right. They were using my EQ, and could not tell that it was doing NOTHING. And, for some reason, they were using my headphones, through which nothing was playing but total silence. 

Wut?

But wait there's more:

They expect to get paid. 

They expect to get paid more than me.

Hold the fucking phone.

I don't think I have ever been so insulted in my entire life.

Club owners/managers/etc, always pay your DJ, and pay them well. People always seem to get confused when it comes to paying the DJ, making excuses as to why they should get less money, and so on. The fact is, you are not paying for the one, two, three-hour set the DJ plays, you are paying for their **experience** - you are paying them for the hours and hours they spent practicing so that they could reach a point where they are able to hold a dancefloor. 

So please, tell me:

How in the ever-living fuck do these guys think they should get paid more than the resident DJ (who practices ""real mixing"" no less than two hours a day) for LITERALLY doing nothing but pressing play?

Again, this is really just a rant, so feel free to downvote and ignore, but I'd love to hear your stories to know I'm not the only one experiencing this sort of bullshit.

TL;DR: Guys want to play at my club. Guys have one laptop. Guys use Windows Media Player. Guys expect to be paid more than me, the resident DJ. Fuck those guys.

Towards the end of the video you can see what the club looks like inside [Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zg5uKkI8PRQ) is the link*** 



So last week I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/r0tff/so_i_just_landed_a_job_at_a_new_strip_club_in/) thread about a new gig I landed. 

Although I could have, I really didn't want to DJ from my computer so I picked up a Hercules RMX and got that hooked up with Traktor. I spent 2 days geting it set up and learning the new console and Traktor for the first time. Coming from my NS7 with itch, it was a totally new way of DJ'ing to me. I like it, but Traktor just seems waay too easy, I see why it gets haters. But overall I do like it and am getting used to it quick. 

Anyways, i also picked up a bunch of billboard stuff, which was absolutely my lifesaver, thank you to whoever posted that! I had a bunch of new music, and a new controller and I was ready to go. 

I showed up at noon on my first day, got my stuff hooked up, went in back to turn on all the amps and there were no subs. Just highs coming from the speakers above the bar. The 4 ceiling mounted midrange speakers speakers were surrounding the room and didnt sound like they were working either. 

I talked to the boss and bartender. ""Um...yeah, the DJ plugged something in last night and it went 'POP' and now they blew all the subs"".

The night before there was some big event going on (this club is in South Beach and it was the Winter Music Conference / Ultra music fest weekend in Miami). The subs blew and the place cleared out because of the bad sound. 

It should be worth noting here that I graduated Full Sail 6 months ago with a degree in Show Production and Touring. (the live music degree).

I went in back switched up some stuff on the sub amps, I guess they blew and they just unplugged them all. There are 4 subs under the stage. I got one side of them working. The other side is wired in series and I know one sub blew, taking out both the subs on that side, which is the side facing the dining area and bar, much more important. 

I crawled under the stripper stage and learned how it was all hooked up. The stage was built around the subs and absolutely cannot be replaced or pulled out easily without pulling up the whole stage. 

By the end of the day i had 2/4 subs working again, the highs above the bar turned down, and the 4 midrange speakers working and sounding good. I have the amps, EQ, Crossover, and a few other units all completely retuned with no red flashing lights. They had a 'sound guy' from the other very well established club in Orlando come down and they were going to rent some external self powered subs that night, and he was going to hook them up. 

The next day I came in to DJ again during the day and saw the 2 rented subs. sitting out. They said they didnt work because the console didnt have any more xlr outputs for them. (the fuck?) 

I went in back, got the 2 input lines from the broken subs and ran those to the rented speakers. They pounded and the club sounded awesome. Bossman went to go return the rented speakers, and buy 2 new ones. 

He brought em back, I got em wired up and setup and got that place rocking. I set everything in back at a decent level, but not too loud. When I left that day, I had it sounding better than it sounded the day the club opened 3 months ago. This was thursday night.

On friday the club had a big event with a bunch of female DJ's. I came in that night about midnight with some friends (a few guys and girls, and the girls were really dressed up) It sounded good, but the DJ's wanted more volume. The head boss said nothing was getting touched in back, till I showed up. I went in back and bumped up everything just little on the crossover and got lots more volume level. It was officially a bangin loud as fuck party now. 

We all got wasted and had a blast hanging out with the DJ's and dancers. The bosses were happy I got it louder and sounding even better (while stupid drunk may I add lol) and the DJ's were happy i got the place bumpin and the party started. 

Another win. 

The next night was Saturday. I went to see Deadmau5 and went to the club afterwards to hang out for a bit. We had a big event with a bunch of breakbeat Dj's (icey, krafty kuts, rob e, etc..). They brought their own system and hooked it up with ours. Again the night was a huge success. My and my gf hung out there a bit and had a blast getting drunk and throwing money at the dancers all night. 



In the end, now that everything has died down, I have absolutely guaranteed myself a DJ position there. I am going to be during the day a bit til I get good on the microphone, then prob will get some night shifts. I guess I'm also the sound guy there too. 

As for my actual DJ'ing, the dancers liked it, the bosses liked it, the bartenders liked it, and the door guy liked it. I did a huge mix of house, top 40, ghetto rap, some rock, old booty bass, and some dubstep.

I cant believe this all happened and I guess I have a new job as a resident DJ and sound guy at the nicest Cabaret and Steakhouse in Miami.

Thank you all soo much for all the great info I got on my last thread it definitely helped me DJ exactly the way they were looking for, instead of the way I have been used to.

Music, particularly dance music is about pleasure, and celebration and the language of dance! 

Practice until you dont make yourself and your friends cringe when you play. Experiment with mixes, with sounds, with tools and styles of music. And make sure you are HAVING FUN. And please for gods sake dont attempt to play a DJ gig outside of your friends basement if you have only been djing for 6 months to a year. PRACTICE MORE!!11!! Aint nobody got time to listen to you be terrible in a bar or a rave or whatever. Its OK to be terrible, its what happens before you are mediocre, and WAY before you are good and its part of learning.

I say this in good spirit as a guy who has been doing this for 15 years next year- strictly dance music (house/techno/minimal/breaks/deep) and a bit of classic hip hop.

When it comes down to it, its about fun, so take a deep breath and work on having fun while you learn, dont worry about being the next avichee or skrilecks :)"	t5_2rddy	True

It's [clear to everyone](http://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/kthlz/youre_not_even_trying/) by now that we need one of these.  Sadly, I don't have the knowledge or time to write up guides on every topic, so what I want to do is have this thread be a link repository for other good threads that people can read to get more info.  I'm gonna keep it in sections and update it regularly.  If you have something you think should be added post it in here or shoot me a message.  If you want to write up a really good post on any informational topic PLEASE do so.  Make a thread about it and I'll link it.  Links to outside websites are fine too if they're good enough.

I'll get it started.

It's blatantly obvious that a lot of people posting such posts clearly don't have a clue as to what's involved (gear &amp; what to learn) ... and that's fine. Just dandy. We all have to start somewhere. 


What strikes me though is that SO many of these posts/people have  done next to zero amount of research themselves into the matter before asking for it to be spoon fed to them.


Is my thinking skewed when i believe that if you really are interested in or passionate about getting into mixing, that you will have at least done some rudimentary research ... a cursory google (or search engine of your choosing) search will result in a plethora of useful sites, videos, forums etc etc that will outline, explain and detail what's involved so you could at least arm yourself with some elementary knowledge on the matter.

I also think there's a lot of lazy morons posting here  :) "	t5_2rddy	True

A DJ who's been spinning for almost as long as I've been alive came up from another state just to watch me play.  I got more compliments on last night than any other event i've played.

I've been buying his records for more than 10 years and he's one of the few names that will sell me a record without hearing it.  I was SO excited to hear him at the Intonation Festival in Chicago in 2005 (this became the Pitchfork festival a few years later).  To say I was disappointed is an understatement.  Every ""song"" he played started groovy, got a little noisy, and then devolved into chaos and utter crap.  Not avant-garde, just shit terrible.  

About a year later he was playing at a club called Sonotheque and I decided to try again.  Maybe his Intonation Festival performance was just a bad day.  Maybe this will be better.  

Not at all.  He mixed genres and styles and train wrecked to the point that 30 minutes into his set more than half the crowd had gone elsewhere.  I stood there with my drink in utter disbelief.  Not only was he mixing poorly, his programming was incomprehensible.  

Skip to new years eve 2011-2012.  He's back in Chicago and playing at Smart Bar.  It's been years since that first performance I saw of his and I think ""SOMEBODY must have told him that he's terrible at DJing by now.  He HAS to have improved.  Nobody can gig this long and not get better.""  

How wrong I was.  Perhaps nobody is willing to tell him that he's fucking terrible.  Perhaps because he's a little insane he just doesn't get it.  But he was playing terrible music, mixing horribly, and every time he would get a vibe on the dance floor he would KILL IT with some fucking insane shit mix of awfulness.  

I will still buy every album, EP, and remix this man puts out.  But I will NEVER AGAIN go see him ""DJ.""

Initially he said he didn't want an opener, but then he came back and said he was looking for a student to mix a house set for an hour before he goes on.  By a stroke of luck, I am that student.  
  
I put ""opening"" in quotes because he doesn't even want me on stage.  So I'll be just offstage (I think) but still mixing for an hour for a couple thousand people.  Kinda lame, but who am I to say no to Avicii?  
  
Anyway, kinda crazy.  If you guys have any comments/questions/concerns/song recommendations, get at me!

1329658411.0	pwepx	Just one of those amazing DJ moments...anyone else have any moments like this?	sjksjksjk	95	7	68	"Tonight I played a house party (maybe 30 or so people) in San Francisco and even though I am an Electrohouse DJ primarily, my friend who threw the party kindly asked for a chill trip-hop set for most of the party. It went really well, people really liked it, I even experimented mixing trip hop with moombahton (which in some cases works better than you might expect, as long as you EQ it right). I mixed solid, but it was just, whatever. It's about time for me to clean up and I fade out the music until someone says ""wait I'm gonna set up a camera to take a picture every few seconds, put on something high energy so the picture will be of us dancing"". So I throw on a Mord Fustang track, the entire party comes out of nowhere and starts going crazy...this turns into 15-20 minutes of high energy house, and it was like 30 people in a tiny room so it just had a great vibe. I mixed like a nut, played just the right stuff, beautiful girls dancing around me, the whole deal. The entire gig was worth that 20 minutes.

I am wondering if anyone cares, but it's just these little moments at little, random gigs that make DJing so fun. (Of course, I don't mind big moments at big gigs either.)

Rap requests all night. 2 Chainz, Biggie, Tribe, even got some Cash Money in there. 

And the night ended with Ginuwine's ""Pony"" with most of the men pulling chairs on the dance floor, sitting on them and having the girls give them lap dances. The groom took his shirt off and proceed to give the bride a lap dance.

Some of you may know me. I'm a mod over in /r/beatmatch (the little brother subreddit for /r/DJs. We deal with the noobs so you guys don't have to.)

I have a simple request for you guys today. We have a MoTM competition over in /r/beatmatch that limits each submission to 15 minutes or less. I'm trying to come up with ways to use this competition to help newer DJs get outside of their comfort zones and discover things they may not have otherwise discovered. For the month of October each of the DJs had to fit at least 10 songs into a 15 minute mix.

I was hoping some of you guys could head over to the voting thread and have a listen to a few of these mixes and provide feedback (and maybe vote for 1 or 2 of them). There's only 7, and each one is under 15 minutes. Please leave constructive criticism that can help them learn and improve as DJs.

[Here is the voting thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/124umx/october_2012_motm_competition_voting_thread/)

Thank you in advance, and if you guys have any other suggestions for mixing challenges that will help /r/beatmatch members learn, please send me a PM!

Edit: I'd just like to say **THANK YOU** to everyone who has left feedback!  I'm sure it is greatly appreciated by the entrants."	t5_2rddy	True
1348656672.0	10i1is	Great DJ bios and the cliches to avoid?	BonjourMyFriends	92	8	53	"I get loads of bad DJ bios sent to me daily by people looking for gigs in my country. 90% of them are poorly written, cliche, and so bland that I'll forget the DJs name as soon as I close the email.

In my opinion the core of the DJ bio should be summed up in a short, single paragraph about the style of music you play and what makes you remarkable or different from other DJs playing the same style. Additional paragraphs can follow, focusing on your story, influences and key gigs that brought you to where you are today, but it's really important to get your message across in the first paragraph. 

Think about it from an employers perspective, the club manager or promoter. Imagine they have a stack of 50 job applications and they need to hire someone for tonight. Ideally they can scan the top of each page and go ""ok this guy is hip hop, this guy is techno, this guy is top 40""... it's the same for people going through hundreds of pages online. Same for the newspaper - nobody reads beyond the first paragraph unless you hook them or they were already interested.



Cliches to avoid:

&gt; ""grew up listening to his parents' music collection""

* What kid didn't? Always remember it's more important that we know what you play **now**, not a chronological history of your favorites during snapshots of your life. If you include this, it goes near the bottom - nobody cares about your childhood unless you're famous.

&gt; ""bought his first decks/CDJs/software""

* Cool! Classic transaction, man. Can I see the receipt? (Just tell them how long you've been playing.)

&gt; ""his eclectic music selection includes tech house, dark tech house and housey tech house""

* ""eclectic"" is a very relative word which, in the music industry, has been abused out of meaning anything. If you only play one genre of music, it's even more important for you to use adjectives to *describe* your style in depth! Often it's hard to pin yourself down - asking a friend to describe your style of DJing can be very helpful.

&gt; ""hard to pin down his style""

* This is just about the worst thing your can write that isn't racist. Also I just listened to your mix and No, this music is called hip hop.

&gt; ""classically trained musician""

* Unless this is backed up by something like a university or orchestra name in the same sentence, we all know it means your mom forced you to take piano lessons.

&gt; ""knows how to read a crowd"" / ""tells a story with music""

* This is like a busdriver saying he knows how to move around in traffic - it's one of the most basic aspects of the job. A better message is that you know how to whip the crowd into a frenzy, but don't SAY that. Describe how *you personally* do it, whether it's through a subtle progression of moods morphing into something euphoric or pyrotechnics and fistpumps.

&gt; ""Shared the stage with [insert famous DJ]""

* You *should* absolutely list famous DJs you opened for, but make it sound like you're the club's/city's go-to DJ for opening international names, not just the promoters buddy who stood on the same stage. On the other side, if you've DJed with a famous DJ from a vastly different genre, listing them might confuse people.

&gt; ""started playing friends' house parties and empty warehouses""

* This is fine if you're starting out, but it's really nothing special as *everyone* started out this way. personally if I was at the level where I had no ""career"" experience or no specific ""achievements"" to point to, I would either write more about my music style or what I am working to accomplish, or else write something really absurd and off-the-wall that displays my personality and music tastes rather than lack of professional experience.

**TL;DR It is more important to be remembered and show personality than to make a list of the same chronological stages every DJ goes through. DON'T FUCKING FORGET TO SAY WHAT YOU PLAY**

Finally, it's important to know your audience - I tweak my bio every time I send it out. And last bit of advice: a good way to make your DJ bio a little different is to read interviews with DJs and ask yourself those questions that you found most interesting. Find a way to re-word your answers into the DJ bio. Good luck!

**If anyone has examples of great DJ bios that stand out please post them.**

As this sub-reddit grows exponentially (congrats on 10k) we are constantly seeing new and old DJs alike joining our community who are not familiar with some of the policies of /r/DJs and I am talking specifically about this one from the sidebar:

&gt; **Please think twice before posting following topics. Instead consider searching for and reading older threads.**

&gt; * ""What music should I play?""

Over the last week there have been no less than six posts breaking the ~~unspoken~~ *constantly spoken* rule of do not ask for music. Instead of just complaining about it I figured it was time to do something about it and first explain why these questions are looked down upon and then explain what you can do to find your own music without asking. 

**Why the Question is Frowned Upon**

* If you don't care about the music you're playing neither will the audience. 

When DJ's spend hours digging through music they have countless ""Ah-hah!"" moments where that 1 minute preview catches their attention and they just have to have the track. That moment when you know you need to have it is the same moment that innumerable possible transitions and mix combinations go through your mind and it is what connects the DJ to their music. That connection is a part of the passion that we all share for the music we're playing when we're behind the decks and without that connection to the music your set is going to be boring and you're going to be no more exciting than a radio playlist. 

If you're playing someone else's library it will be insincere and you won't have the intimate knowledge of the music or the same passion for it. I might as well rent a jukebox if you don't know and love the music you're playing. Doing the leg work and finding those gems yourself is a key part of knowing your library.

* Every DJ needs to have their own sound and digging for music is not only an important skill but it's a deeply personal experience. 

As more and more of our role behind the decks is automated and simplified one of the last remaining things that separates the great DJs from the mediocre DJs is the music they're playing and the connection they have to it. Anyone can go out and download the Beatport Top 100 and play a set but it is the amazing DJs who take you on a journey with their music (sorry for the cliché) and actually help you get lost in the music.

When two DJs playing the same genre are booked back to back on the same stage it would be ridiculous if they both played the exact same songs, we would expect them to each have their own unique sound and flavour... Why then would you want to sound exactly like some other DJ by asking for all of their top tracks? Do you really want to sound exactly like me when you play out?

* If you need to ask what music to play it's safe to assume you've taken a gig you're not prepared for or equipped for and you can read my article on DJTechTools as to why that's a bad idea: http://www.djtechtools.com/2012/11/23/taking-dj-gigs-outside-of-your-normal-genre/

**How to Dig For Music**

It would be unfair of me to say ""dig for your own music"" and not at least give you some pointers on how to go about it. I will explain my method for digging on Beatport but keep in mind there are lots of different ways to dig for music going back to it being a deeply personal experience. 

1 - I go to beatport.com open the house section or tech-house section (my genres) and browse through the new releases or search for artists or labels I know I already like. The new releases are a better place to start than the charts because by the time a track hits the Top 10 for a genre it is probably already over saturated. Now, that is not to say you should never download anything from the Top 10 but it should not be the foundation for your entire library.

2 - When I find a track that catches my attention (let's use Jo Manji - Long Train for this example) I have a number of options after I add it to my cart:

* I can click the label (Funktion Recordings) and browse their house releases as most will likely be similar and through that I will find not only tracks but other artists to use as jumping points.
* I can check Jo Manji's releases to see if anyone remixed Long Train and checkout tracks by those remixers.
* I can checkout other labels that Jo Manji has released on for similar tracks and artists.
* I can use the Beatbot Recommendations section of Beatport to see if it found anything similar.
* And finally I can see if Long Train is included in any releases or DJ charts to find similar songs.

3 - When I find a similar track by those methods, say Dancin' (Original Mix) by B-Sensual &amp; No!end (which was in the recommendations section of Long Train) I repeat that process all over again using that track and it's label (B-Sensual) as the jump off... Within 5 minutes of opening Beatport I will have 20+ tabs open.

That's all without leaving Beatport... You need to remember that everything on Beatport for the most part can be clicked: the artist, label, genre, remixer, and so on. These links are like breadcrumbs for you to follow and the further you follow them the more gems you will find burried deep in the catalogue. 

**Where to Find Music**

But why is it that people don't enjoy music until it is all over the media(internet, radio or TV). Months ago I used to play Harlem Shake and other big trap songs for a regular audience at clubs and bars but usually didn't get a good reaction from the crowd. Now if I were to play Harlem Shake people would be all over it. It frustrates me so much as a DJ to see this happen all the time.

Does anyone else feel like this?	dancing_psychonaut	99	17	101	"So last night I DJ'd whilst on acid (not a heroic dose, something very manageable) and if you've done acid then you know exactly what I mean when I say you're so much better at detecting bullshit and looking through appearances and seeing people at their core. 

Anyways, the entiiiiire night I had the most drunk, entitled, and rude girls coming up to me and DEMANDING that I play their songs immediately (most of the time these are songs I've already played - Die Young , Thrift Shop , Good Time , etc). When I tried to blow them off or I didn't play the song right at that instant they got so angry and threw a small fit, one girl proceeded to give me the middle finger right in my face for an entire minute until she got bored and left. 

This whole experience just really made me think about how spoiled and entitled attractive women can be. And when they don't get what they want - because they usually get what they want all the time - they blow a childish fit. It pissed me off to no end. 

Am I alone in this observation? I honestly don't know how many of you guys DJ as another job... I can't take the heckling from the crowd.

I've played for these guys in the past and they were always reluctant to pay cause they never saw DJs as essential for parties. They were throwing a big party and asked for me to play. I told them my normal fee and they said they'd get back to me. Oddly enough I found the poster for their party in a Reddit post and it had a different DJ on it. I was told that they went with him cause he offered to do it for free. Luckily, he was really shitty and they asked me to do the next party.

New DJs, I realize that you are eager to get out there and will do anything to get a gig (even promise to play a genre you aren't familiar with, which is ill advised). But please don't go to a group that already has a DJ and offer your services for free. You **devalue** the rest us. I bring $3000+ worth of equipment to these parties, I can't afford to do anything for free. I'm aware that this is a competitive market but doing things for free won't get you anywhere. Eventually you will want money and you will have a bitch of a time trying to get any of your regulars to pay you.

Also, while I'm not solely reliant on the money I get from gigs, others might be. It's one thing to take their job because you are more talented, it's insulting to take their job because you offered to do it for free. People are cheap, they will choose the guys doing it for free over the ones that are talented.

Doing a friends party for free is ok. Taking a paying job from another DJ and doing it for free is not ok.

Instead of sitting around and playing Diablo, I decided to go out and soak up some more of the local night life; pay a visit to other clubs in the area and see what's going on. 

Anyway, long story short; I went to one of the local hotspots that I frequent, I love the electro influenced music they play. They had a pretty well known DJ playing a guest spot. Me being the friendly person I am, I went up to introduce myself. That's when things started to go wrong. 
Now, I've heard good things about this guy, and I was incredibly disappointed. First off, he was sporting a T-shirt that read: ""I'm the DJ, not your personal fucking jukebox."". That's cool, I know where you're coming from, but there's no need to be a total dick about it. Secondly, when I went up, I approached him with a smile on my face and my hand out for a handshake...

""Hi, my name is...""

""I don't give a fuck who you are, do you know who I am?""

""Umm, yeah? I was just coming up to say hi... I'm the DJ over at Halo.""

""I couldn't care less who you are or what you do. Does it look like I give a fuck?""

Instead of clipping him upside the head, I went to the bar. He then went on to play really weak 'wubby' breaks tracks, all of which sounded like they were downloaded from YouTube and liked to backspin instead of beat match.

with the amount of dj information on the internet, i was wondering i there exist a place where you can see each mix method.

example:

Drop, a drop is a sudden change in music from one song to the other mostly performed in Hip-hop music.
Also refered to as: Slam, Clash.
audio example of the method here.

Toneplay, putting cue's on notes of a song and finger drumming them into the shape of the notes of the next to play song.
Also refered to as: ----

Here's my first attempt"	tads	78	6	32	"I wanted to make a list of things similar to [Kahn academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/exercisedashboard) which I was having students use to learn some math stuff.  I thought it would be helpful for me to have a sort of set of lessons or list of intermediate checkpoints along the way.  I looked for some places but I didn't see things really laid out into as small of pieces as I would have liked. 

So here is my attempt, with the categories, and the sub categories within them.  Let me know if I should add/subtract anything or any other ideas you may have for me to improve it.

Song selection
&gt;Picking the next song:  genre - era - instrumentation - key - ""feel""- bpm
&gt;&gt;Picking next hour's song:  Dance floor energy - getting between each of the above - bpm transitions


Beat matching 
&gt;beat - phase - acapellas - multiple decks


Transitions
&gt;When: end of song - into break - out of break - middle of track at the verse
&gt;&gt;How: cross fader - line faders - eq knobs/filter - slam

Creating Elements
&gt;sample portion and play it under/over new track to create a new segment/phrase - used acapella to create new segments - use loops to create new segment - use duplicate track
Mash- make a new song combining - Making your own buildups/drops

Playing Out
&gt;Managing the soundsystem - crowd reading - Handling Mistakes - Performing/Crowd Appeal

I know most of you here hate Top 40 and I'm ok with that but what I don't understand is why are some of you accepting Top 40 gigs when you hate the genre.

I wrote this a few days ago but I feel this needs to be reiterated:
What if you went to a Hardstyle event and found out that the promoter hired a DJ that couldn't give two shits about Hardstyle and played Top 40 all night. Imagine how disappointed the people who came for Hardstyle would be. Now imagine you are a Hardstyle DJ. This guy took what could have been your job all because he wanted a gig regardless of what genre was required.

When you accept a Top 40 gig without being familiar with the genre, you are doing the same thing.

Now I realize that most of the people caught in these situations are new to Djing. You have to realize that if you are to stick with Dubstep/Happycore/etc you aren't gonna get much work. You aren't helping yourself by accepting gigs for genres you are not familiar with.

Also, playing Top 40 is not as easy as “downloading the top songs on iTunes” as many have suggested here. I spend hours each week reading music blogs, listening to Soundclouds, and watching the charts to see what's rising and what's falling. If you are gonna play a genre, commit to it, don't ever half-ass it.

So how does one avoid these situations?

Ask the host what genre needs to be played BEFORE you accept the gig. It's that simple. If he asks for Bmore Club and you play DnB just tell him that you aren't the right DJ for the job, he'll understand. Sure, you are gonna get less jobs that way but it's for the better.

Also, never accept “Just play whatever” as an answer. You think it's a free pass to play your favorite tunes but it almost never turns that way. After playing Tech House/Breaks/Techno for 20 minutes, 90% of the time the host will ask you to switch to Top 40. Problem is you don't have any Top 40 and it turns into an uphill battle for the rest of the night. Don't let this happen to you.

Just my two cents on the situation."	t5_2rddy	True

It is time for another omers mega post! These are almost always inspired by pure frustration with repetitive posts on /r/DJs and /r/Beatmatch and this is no exception; it is time to revisit the question on a lot of people’s minds: “How do I break out of the bedroom?”

## Are You Ready for an Audience?

This question is one you can only answer yourself; there is no objective way to measure when someone is ready to start playing in clubs or at raves or wherever it is you want to play. The most important thing you need is confidence, are you confident you’ll do a good job? If so, you’re probably ready to at least start trying.

Some other things you should consider:

* **Are you ready to adapt to changing dancefloors?** If the dance floor isn’t feeling what you’re playing are you able to recognize that and take your set in a different direction? 
* **Are you willing to spend a huge chunk of time digging for music regularly?** In clubs you need to constantly be adding new music both new and classic. Keeping things fresh week to week will keep you sane and the dance floor packed. In this day and age record labels release new singles to YouTube the day they come out so people in the club don’t have to wait for the radio or club DJs to expose them to new music and you need to keep up with it because I guarantee it will happen where someone requests a song that came out literally that day.
* **Can you troubleshoot common DJ problems?** When you are in front of an audience you need to deal with problems as simple as a loose cable to as catastrophic as a dead deck and do it all as quickly as possible without interrupting the flow of the dance floor. Knowing how your gear works and how to fix issues with it and knowing at least the basics of the rest of the audio chain is a must when you start playing live. 

## Gear, Gear, Gear

Lots of people ask if their controller is appropriate for clubs or if they will need to use what the club provides. The answer is: it depends on the club. You should always ask before accepting a gig what the gear situation is and if you should or are expected to bring your own gear. 

Yes, it is true that CDJs are the industry standard in clubs but your first live performance is not the place to learn how to use them. If the option exists to bring your controller then bring your controller… Better you sound good using a controller than try and use the standard just because everyone else does. If you’re not able to bring your controller for any reason postpone playing out for at least a couple weeks and get your hands on some CDJs to practice (rent, borrow, whatever it takes) because the transition from controller to CDJ is not as easy as you might think; you might think you don’t use visual cues on your laptop but you're likely to get a rude awakening when they're gone.

## Self Promotion in the Digital Age

It’s a different world out there today than it was when I started DJing, these days the DJ is expected to do a lot of the promotion not just for themselves which was always the case but for the nights they're playing.

**Facebook:** If you do not have a Facebook account, go get one now. I don't care what your objections to Facebook are you need a Facebook account for hocking events and connection with the scene.

**Posting Mixes:** Go get yourself a Soundcloud account and a Mixcloud account and start posting mixes (remember to cross-post to Facebook) and start pushing them on /r/Mixes and forums and wherever you can get a listen. Every promoter and club owner worth their salt will want to hear a mix when you approach them and they'll notice the number of listens your mixes have (hint: 0 is a bad thing).

A note on mixes: make it clear to promoters and club owners who you send your mix to that the mix is a representation of your skill but you're adaptable and you will apply the skill in the mix to music appropriate for their venue and they should not assume you always sound like your mixes (unless you do in which case you have bigger problems and you need to go back to “are you adaptable” above.)

## Get the Fuck Out of the House

This isn't the “ok, time to start booking gigs” section, that’s the next section; this is the “go have a fucking drink” section. 

Promoters and owners are way more likely to book people they've seen before so get out and have a drink, meet some people, tear up a rug, and party hard (without passing out in the lobby (that never looks good)). 

If you don’t go out to clubs or parties under your own steam just to enjoy the atmosphere why should they book you? If you were a promoter would you book one of those “I don't like clubs, I’d rather watch a Zoo Juniors marathon on Animal Planet on a Saturday Night than go out” people? 

If you're a shy introverted person you're going to have a bad time as a DJ so you better work on that (Rye helps).

## Lets Start Looking for Gigs

So you think you're ready, you made a Facebook account, you posted some mixes, and you've been out to some parties… It’s time to actually start talking to promoters and trying to book gigs.

There are lots of different ways to approach this task and each is suited to different personalities, for example, If you’re not an overly outgoing person you probably don't want to shake every hand in the city. Each method also has pros and cons, for example, targeting specific promoters instead of blanketing the city with your mix CDs means it will likely take you longer to book gigs but you're more likely to book gigs you’ll actually enjoy.

An incomplete list of way to approach promoters:

* **The talk to everyone/I'm the shit method:** This is exactly what it sounds like, throw enough shit at the wall and hope something sticks. Go out and talk to every promoter and club owner you can find introducing yourself as a DJ looking for gigs. With the right personality this method is extremely effective but is likely to land you some less than stellar gigs playing commercial top 40 on a Tuesday or something.
* **The roundabout:** Make friends with other DJs instead of promoters and make it known you’re a DJ. Eventually one of them is likely to introduce you to a promoter or if they like you enough ask you fill in for them when they need to go out of town for grandpa’s 8th wedding. This method lets you target specific venues and scenes and is less abrasive so you're less likely to piss people off by coming off as pushy but it takes some patience. 
* **The job applicant:** In this method you either approach promoters and owners with or drop deliver during off-hours a well prepared press kit complete with headshot and mix CD showcasing your Photoshop skills on the cover. It’s quite likely 95% of your painstakingly prepared press kits are going in the garbage without a second glance but the same thing can be said about your resume, it’s the people that actually look at it that matter and this method might return a handful of gigs to the person too shy to go out and actually interact with people.
* **The do nothing:** This method involves posting mixes and being active on the internet and hoping a promoter in your city notices and contacts you. This method will require a lot of patience and may never pay off… Don’t do this.

There is one secret you need to know about getting gigs and it applies to a lot of things in life:

&gt; **It’s far more important who you know than what you know.**

So get out there and meet people.

I am an open format DJ and the opening DJ at a 550ish person club, some things I look out for:

- When girls enter the club what kind of music gets them moving a bit before they start getting drinks

- When girls come into the club

- If I take a risk and play somthing different how do people react to it

- What amount of the dance floor is guys vs girls

These are totally over simplified, but I wanted to get the ball rolling here.

1346175879.0	yyzgm	A lot of people ask about tag teams. Here is our setup.	omers	76	9	40	"We do a 3-way tag set once a month and I figured I would explain it for people.

First, here is the basic wiring diagram: http://i.imgur.com/ItXou.png

The explanation...

**Mixer 2** 

- Has the Kontrol S4's master output plugged in to Ch1 Line
- Has Out 1 &amp; 2 from the Serato SL1 plugged in to Ch2 and Ch4 Line
- The Tech 12 controls the SL1s Deck 1, the DJ who uses it uses Instant Doubles to switch between decks.
- The master out (RCA) leads to Mixer 1.

**Mixer 1**

- Has the master output of Mixer 2 plugged in to Ch1 Line
- Has the Serato SL3s Left/Right plugged in to Ch2 and Ch4 Line
- The SL3s decks are controlled by the CDJ 900s
- Runs XLR out to the amp rack.
- Runs 1/4"" out to the monitors.
- Runs RCA out from the REC to the SL3 Aux In for recording.

**Examples**

- To run Kontrol S4 audio Ch1 needs to be up on Mixer 1 and Mixer 2 and both Mixer 1 &amp; 2 must have their master volumes up.
- To run audio from CDJ2 only Ch4 on Mixer 1 and the Mixer 1 master need to be up.

**How we work together**

- All three DJs by the nature of the setup can mix at the same time (against the monitors) so anything is possible.
- Generally, we layer multiple tracks simultaneously. CDJ1 may be playing a full track, the Tech12 may be playing another track EQ'd for just the high end, and the S4 may have a vocal loop going.
- Each DJ is responsible for keeping anything they add to the mix beatmatched. If you brought in the newest track, you keep everything mixed. 
- We each signal each other if we are going to drop someone else's signal on the mixer we are responsible for or if we wish for part of a track to solo without anything over top. We also signal when we're ready for someone to drop their track so ours can take over (or we reach over and do it ourselves).
- Working together we can EQ between two mixers as we're all experienced. For example, one DJ might turn down the bass on Mixer 2's playing track while I up the bass on a track playing on Mixer 1 and in time we can go back and forth between the two by watching each other. 

The real key is knowing your partners, working together, communicating, and having fun. The more experiance each person has both alone and together also goes a long way.

1338703356.0	uiacv	No Power? No Problem!	DirtyHairy1	75	5	19	"Just played an insane house party last night. Original plan was 30 degree weather, outdoor, pool, DJ for a few hours, live band for a couple hours and then back to DJ'ing for the rest of the night. The day finally arrives and there is a 100% chance of rain (ended up raining for about 24 hours straight). The wind is blowing so hard that 3 hours before people are supposed to arrive, tree branches are falling on power lines and we lose power. The start time is fast approaching and we're all shitting ourselves wonder what is going to happen, if people are going to show, when the power is coming back on etc.. 

My heart is in my stomach as the first few people start arriving and we're still in the dark. We have candles all over the place (the old fashioned ornate holders and giant lanterns) illuminating what little we can. We're joking about running to Canadian Tire to buy a generator to get the music going when my friend remembers he has a gas powered one in his barn. Fast forward 20 minutes. Four guys are running back through the pouring rain carrying this generator, they start it up and we have a pretty classic night starting up. I ended up playing for 5 or 6 hours total to a packed house, in pitch black save for the few candles and the band even came in and did a smaller set indoors off this thing. It was an absolutely unbelievable night. The best part is, just as the few of us staying at the house lay down to pass out/fall asleep all of the lights came on (around 4am).

**TL;DR:** I played a house party by candlelight, off a gas powered generator, with a huge storm raging outside, while the entire town had no power.

We spin all types of EDM from Moomba, to house, to D&amp;B, basically if its electronic, we play it. Anyways, most house parties we play at, there are always TONS people who complain that we aren't playing any ASAP or Chief Kief. THIS party though (a pajama party btw), we made a few old school hip hop edits that went from an EDM remix to the original back to the remix. We had THE WHOLE PARTY raging/shuffling/dancing the WHOLE NIGHT. We rocked it hard enough that at one point we emptied out the Beer Pong tables because people wanted to come rage inside. We were supposta spin for an hour and a half or so but ended up spinning for about 5 hours and getting TONS of free alcohol. The best part was 90% of the set was completely drunken improv where we experimented with things we normally wouldnt have done. The owner of the house usually throws MASSIVE Halloween parties every year and asked us to come back then as well as any other parties she throws. It was the best DJ experience of my life and i cant wait for Halloween. Just my little excited DJ rant :p	t5_2rddy	True

Whether you're a bass head or a techno snob, whether you like festivals or basement raves, whether you spin vinyl, cds or use controllers, there are a few people that have been so influential to the evolution of dance music that we all should be thankful, despite our personal tastes.  This guy is one of them.  He's done it all, helped shaped Detroit techno as Plastikman, started the groundbreaking Minus label (after Plus), revolutionized DJ technology over and over and over again and to this day is one of the most respected DJs out there.

Oh, and he's been doing it for about 20 years.  No matter what you're style is, I truly believe every DJ can learn something from Richie.  Here's some of my favorite material regarding him and his career, I hope it inspires you as much as it has me:

Excellent! :)

You've probably noticed that we have cleaned up the sidebar a little and added a little banner at the top. We've done this as we want to make it as clear as possible to new members what to post where so we can avoid having a front page of nothing but ""omg! skrillex is bad"", ""DAE beatmatch"" and other such circlejerks.  
We have also decided to ban all image macros and rage comics as we feel they add little to the quality of the subreddit and can cause interesting discussion to be hidden under them. Feel free to submit that kind of content to the excellent [/r/DJsCirclejerk](/r/DJsCirclejerk).

1331162729.0	qmget	Professionalism		69	7	25	"After seeing a fair amount of threads on here recently that deal with the issues that arise in attempting to be/being a professional DJ, I decided to offer my opinion on this, as well as write up a basic introduction to being a professional for all the bedroom/basement/house party heroes we have here.  So here's a bit of advice I have about being a professional DJ/Musician:

Getting Gigs:

How do you get gigs?  It's a weird thing, and I don't have a load of advice on it.  The best advice is pretty simple though: network like a motherfucking ninja.  The more guys you know the easier it is to get gigs, and it builds on itself.  So how do you network?  Go out with friends to various clubs/events in your area, and eventually you'll meet people.  Play a shitload of house parties, and network there, this is why facebook and whatnot is great.  Maybe you'll meet a dude who works at a local club and can get you opening spots, who knows.  If you know enough people opportunities will arise.

Turning down gigs:

I know this is an enviable position to have, but if you're successful enough this is something that comes up fast.  My advice is that you should turn almost nothing down without a really good reason until you're solidly booked every friday/saturday night.  Taking a lot of gigs is the way to build up a great reputation, and once you have that reputation you can get payed more and thus you have to play less of the small shitty gigs.  It's fine to turn down gigs if you have good reasons (ownership/promoter has a reputation for dirtiness, bad experiences at said club) but other than that you should never be the guy who says no.

Cancelling:

Never ever flake out on shit without a really good reason and good notice, this will get you blacklisted fast.  If you have to drop out find a replacement, and not your buddy tim who just got a controller but he's actually really good and can do some awesome stuff.  Make 

Getting paid:

The debate on wether or not to get paid when you start out is pretty big, but I'm pretty into the camp that says you should always demand compensation.  If you do your thing for free it says to the promoter/owner that what you do is worthless, and they profit off of your pro bono work.  If someone asks you to play their bar and they won't pay you ask for around 50 and a similar tab for you and your friends, once your name is out there I would say to get at least 200 and 100ish in tab, but this varies widely by city.

The next part of getting paid is when; this happens before the event.  You either get paid by cheque a week or two before so you know it clears, or you get paid in cash the week of.  Unless you have a personal connection to the promoter/owner you get your money before you bring your gear out and set foot on stage.  If someone doesn't have the money or won't pay you beforehand they're probably not the kind of person you want to be involved with, as it will just lead to problems down the road.

Another thing to think of is gear rental fees.  You paid good money for your stuff, and if you're bringing it out charge for it.  It's one thing if it's just a laptop+controller, but if you're hauling out a few technics and a mixer build that into your fee.  If the promoter wants you to let other guys use them you have two options; either say no (you're a DJ, not a rental shop) or make sure you've got it insured and you're getting rental fees (charge them a lot) for it (insurance is key, imagine how pissed you'd be if another guy ruined a few thousand worth of gear).

At the gig:

This is a big thing about professionalism for me personally and something that I feel everyone should hold close and dear:  You are paid to do something, and you do the best you can.  You bring your a-game to everything you do.  The most important gig of your life is the most immediate one, and not the hypothetical mega festival one you know that you'll be booked for in 5 years.  You should never, ever phone in a gig, and don't treat a gig like it's beneath you; if you said you'd play it you're going to do the best job you can.  This also means staying relatively sober, there's a time for partying: after your set.  While getting wasted is a lot of fun I'd recommend to limit your alcohol to one or two drinks and no more, it can really effect you.  Stay the fuck away from all illegal substances (a bit of pot is ok if you're a seasoned professional at it), because they can drastically screw you up without you being aware of it.

The big thing to remember is don't get an inflated opinion of yourself and think that relatively lame, menial gigs are beneath you.  If you're so great, where is your Ibiza residency?  It's also important to have the mindset that you're only as good as the last gig you played.  Sure, you might have shit going on in your personal life but you ignore that and do the best you can.  Nobody at the club cares that your dog just died, they came out for a good night and you'll give it to them.  Also, really consider what it means to be sick.  I was at an event once with a drummer who had a bucket next to his kit because he got food poisoning that day.  The dude was vomiting and managed to play a one hour set, and he didn't sound bad either.  That's the kind of guy who will get hired a lot because he's got amazing levels of commitment.

The last thing to remember is that since DJing has become more and more accessible it's easier and easier to replace you.  If you aren't a complete professional it's pretty easy for an owner to get someone else, and there's a hell of a lot of bedroom warriors willing to give it a go for free.

1310925084.0	is474	I mean no disrespect, but as a 20+ years DJ I am curious about something...	smmat	78	17	179	"Hello r/DJs.

I've been reading this subreddit for a while and see that many here fully embrace the newer technologies, which I think is great, I certainly have (I'm on Traktor). Many of you seem to have started DJing recently enough that these new technologies are all you know, and to you I say welcome to our world. You are in for a hell of a lot of good times.

What I'm curious about though is why do so many new DJs don't feel the need to learn to mix the old fashion way, by manually beat matching and mixing your tracks? Now don't get me wrong here: I'm not about to call you fake or anything like that. Frankly, had the possibility of auto-sync mixing existed when I first started, I'm not sure I wouldn't have taken advantage of it. That said, I am so grateful I got to know the days when DJing meant putting a record on a platter, cueing it up in the headphone, adjusting the pitch control and blending the tracks in &amp; out, while maintaining a visual connection with the room.

What I'm suggesting here is that if you're a new DJ and have the means to practice mixing music manually, even if it's with a digital system like Traktor, by all means, do it! Even if you only do it at home, for your own education/culture/experience, what you'll get out of it can't be measured. Actually, I really feel you'd be missing out on the whole DJ experience if you don't.

EDIT: I would even add that learning how to mix manually will enhance anyone's capabilities, even if they use auto-sync while performing.

**TL;DR: I think any DJ's experience isn't complete if they don't, at one point or another, learn to mix the traditional way.**

**EDIT 2:** Thanks everyone for participating in this discussion. I'm personally very pleased with seeing how involved everyone is with their craft, whichever way they choose to work. At the end of the day, as long as you're having fun doing what you do and that you have genuine passion and respect for what you are doing, it's pretty safe to say we are all collectively making things go forward. I look forward to more exchanges with you all. Keep on rockin'."	t5_2rddy	True

1336303474.0	t9kxu	TIL that beatmatching at college-parties is not required	php_TANKER	88	24	116	"I usually play at clubs and private parties. EDM is dominant. I have some ""mainstream"" music that works at places where people just wanna hear their favorite songs. 

So my friend called me up last morning and asked if I wanted to gig at a college party with him, I was like why not? 

We got there, he started playing, and I noticed that neither did he beatmatch nor mix with bars, he just ""hard"" dropped every track without any timing at all. Sometimes it sounded horrible, sometimes decent. People still danced because they didn't care. 

When I played, I layed down a decent 45 minutes of perfect mixing (mostly miami/club house and some pop-songs), people seemed to enjoy it, they danced and went crazy and whatnot. After a while though, a lot of people went up to the booth and said things like ""this is too slow"" or ""put on some more music faster"" after I had one song play for more than 1.5 mins. I was confused and asked my buddy what the deal was. He said, just mix in everything fast and don't care about the technical part, so I tried that and guess what? People started whooing and jumping. I was flabbergasted, I had never realized how much people love SHITTY mixing. I told my buddy: That was the worst mixover I have ever done. He answered: Yeah but that's what they want. 

I am probably never playing at a party like that again. I don't see the point in bringing expensive professional equipment when you might as well bring two iPods and plug into the PA. 

So guys, before you jump on the bandwagon and play at fratparties, consider what you are doing. 

Do you have enought pop-music? Do you know what people listen to? Are you prepared to throw your soul as a DJ away and mix like a ten-year old on crack? 

If yes, go ahead. If no, try looking for serious people who know what mixing is when looking for gigs. 

Sorry if I sound like I have a grudge or anything, I just wanted to vent a little bit. I have been practicing for several hours every day for over a year now and I just felt like my skills are being wasted.

As awesome as the iPhone's camera is, it's not that impressive indoors. Bring a cheap point and shoot, and have people take pictures for/with you. And sometimes it's just hard to track down pictures that other people took of you at your events. 

Take pictures of all your gigs, and post them in albums (Flickr, Facebook, etc). Take pictures of the party/event, take pictures with all the guests (everyone wants pictures with the DJ). The more fun the people look like they're having in the pictures, the more successful your pictures will be in helping you bring in more gigs.

Promote...
Profit

We took the place by storm, and it felt awesome.  The resident on Thursdays called in sick, and I was recommended to the owner via a mutual friend whom I don't know how to thank enough.

**Notable occurrences:**

- I feel like everyone bought me a beer. 

- My girlfriend tripped on the cable connecting my external audio card to the house mixer and stopped the music for a second, but I handled it swiftly and gracefully, and nobody gave me a hard time about it.  

- The owner walked over to the house pa mixer early on in the night, and I thought he was gonna turn me down. Instead, he turned me up.

- I learned the value of Facebook as a short notice promotional tool.  A post made at 5pm about a party at 9pm resulted in multiple reposts and a ton more support than I initially thought I would have received (about 30 people came just to see me, which is pretty good in a small local bar in my town, this is in addition to anyone that came to see the acoustic guitar cover act before me, and all the people that just wandered in and stayed, the bar was full, so I think I was doing it right).

- I think I'm officially the guy that they call whenever an act cancels now. (This is a step toward residency, right?)

Anyway... **Happy New Year r/DJs! Hope everyone's set goes well!**

1349249733.0	10v5pr	Why does every DJ talk about producing likes it's learning to tie your shoes?	DirtyHairy1	66	11	92	"Every damn DJ I meet, ""Do you produce?"" ""You should produce bro.""

I understand why they say it. They (and their promoters/managers) all want to be the next Avicii or Tiesto, but producing a song (well) isn't just something you can pick up over night. And even if you have the technical know-how you can't just instantly have the theoretical knowledge to write music. And even if you have both of those you just may not have any talent. Every kid plays the guitar or some instrument at some point in their life, they're not all making money off of songs they wrote or getting any recognition. 

I guess this post is half rant, half what are your thoughts/experiences with this? How many of you have gone from DJ to producer or vice versa? How long did you produce, how much music theory did you know and how much sound engineering knowledge did you have before you made something that other people enjoyed? 

And for the record, yes, I a little mad. "	t5_2rddy	True

1341112777.0	vv4gz	Had my first gig last night.  I didn't think I could love DJing more than I already did...	GDIBass	67	9	27	"I've been a bedroom DJ for over a year, with a mixtrack for 6 months, and more recently (as of January) some CDJ 900s and a DJM 800.  I moved into a new awesome condo, and a new neighbor of mine is a DJ who occasionally throws events at a small club, which almost feels a bit more like a dive bar.  He came over while I was DJing one day, and asked me to play at this little club he plays at (for a pretty small amount of money).  Obviously I was just excited to play out, so I said yes.

The sound was terrible, they only had the main speakers and no booth monitors, so beatmatching was hard as hell.  It took longer than expected to set up, because the cabling was all over the place, and we could barely track down the amplifier.  Even the power strip for the amp was in a bad place, and it got kicked more than once (killing the music, fortunately it never got kicked by me).  Thank god I'm a technical guy, because I don't know how someone who wasn't technical was gonna figure that stuff out.

Despite the rough set up, the event itself amazing.  I had an absolute blast.  We probably only had a maximum of 40 people in the place at any given time but it was SO much fun.

At first I was having a bit of trouble getting people to dance at first (due to the more dive bar structure of the venue), so I ended up experimenting a bit to see what got the crowd going (the favorite track of the night I think was Biscuit Factory by Uppermost).  It felt amazing to throw down a track and have a bunch of people groove to it.

It was my first experience trying to read the crowd, which was really cool.  My DJ friend said I did a really good job adjusting to the vibes, and that was cool as well.  I had probably 4 or 5 random people walk up to me after my set was up and tell me I had an awesome set.

I didn't really think I could love DJing MORE than I already did... but apparently it was possible.  I cannot WAIT to get more gigs, and I think I'm going to start actively pursuing them now.

Hopefully there will be a lot more to come!

Anyways, thank you /r/Djs for the advice/tips/tricks that you've shown me over the last year (my other user is Pr0metheusMusic).  They've been a huge help!"	t5_2rddy	True
1322661062.0	muph9	You are a DJ if you have the knowledge and music collection to captivate a crowd for four hours on a regular basis without repeating yourself.

When in the nursing program, my classmates would ask ""Do you work"" and I would simply tell them ""Yea, I'm a mobile DJ and that's about it. My dad started the business"". Now during a resume class my nursing program provided for us, I put down ""mobile DJ"" as previous work experience. While the instructor was reviewing my resume, other people heard what I've put down and started chuckling. I was even told ""Mike, don't put that but something more real"" by one of my classmates.  I just replied ""So your telling me a service I provide and get paid for isn't a job?""


Now fast forward to today. I was in post conference at our clinical rotation site and out instructor was telling us how we made sacrifices during the year and said ""we spend more time at work than with our families"". I replied ""Yup"" out loud. Everyone laughed and said ""Mike you're unemployed"". They know I'm a DJ and I just kept quite. I held in the anger but I wanted to tell them off. They don't see being a DJ as a type of job, just a hobby. I felt like that my 11 years as a mobile DJ was invalidated. They don't know what goes in to being a mobile DJ: planning the party programs with the celebrant, coordinating with the banquet/ facility staff, unloading/loading equipment,  setting and packing up the equipment, and etc.

These drunk frat bros were being reckless on the street and the cops flagged them down. I got a call to kill all the music. Once the cops got there, they were being complete assholes to everyone. They were taking everyones ID's and were giving every possible person a ticket. My friends left me behind because they were outside at the time and I had no one to help me pack up all my equipment. I wasn't about to leave any of my equipment so I stayed behind and tried to pack up as quickly as possible. A cop came over to me and took my license and started questioning me. He was saying that I was going to take full responsibility of the party and the house because I supplied the music. He forced me to go upstairs and leave my equipment behind. Note: I was the last person who was not a police officer to leave the basement. After waiting a while I luckily just got a ticket for ""Loud Music"", even though that's BS. After I get my ticket, I go downstairs to get my stuff and the basement was completely trashed. There are drinks poured all over all over the basement and the bar was completely turned over. But worst of all, there were drinks poured all over my equipment. I haven’t tested at of it yet since I literally just got home but I doubt my mixer will work. I am completely sure that I was the last one to leave the basement. The cops, there were four of them, were walking around the property and two of them stayed back when I went upstairs. Now most of my equipment is possibly ruined and I honestly don’t know what to do. Luckily I don’t bring anything fancy to these types of parties because I was expecting that to happen eventually, but the fact that a cop might have deliberately ruined my equipment makes me really angry.

Sorry for ranting I just wanted to let it out so I can go to sleep.

I learned my lesson and know now what to do next time. Has anyone been in the same situation as me?

**TL;DR** Cops busted a party I was DJing. They were being complete assholes and I suspect that one of them poured drinks all over my equipment

So I asked him, ""You want it harder?"" ""what, like R&amp;B?"" lol. Once everyone was in the venue, I kicked it up a notch and went complextro and finally ended up in dubstep-land. The event promoter came over, asked for my card, and said I'd be hearing from him soon. I also had a number of individuals come up and compliment me. I don't get to play live very often, so that was really cool. One lady asked if I had a residency anywhere and wanted to know where she could see me play a full set, without all the shenanigans of an MMA fight. feelsgoodman.jpg I had another lady come up and ask me if I just had come from Coachella.

EDIT: 
I want to add that my friend was actually a bar-back before he was the LD and the resident LD just left one day. I already had a job with a lighting company and decided to train him to take over for the LD. Now he hires me to be a loader/monitor engineer, and he's my boss.  /job_security_fail

EDIT2:
The promoter just got back to me and I'll be providing sound and DJing this weekend at Mud Factor out in San Bernadino, CA! FUCK YEAH! Thank you all for your support. I know I'm a n00b (only 2 years) and have a lot to learn, but thanks to this and other communities on reddit, I feel like I've been on gigs with you all and have picked up some tricks of the trade (of DJ'ing). I also run a very small lighting and sound company with occasional digital projections [when i have the time as i lost my business partner to a disagreement :'-(]. I'm sure I will run into a couple of you if you are in the Los Angeles area. I've been fortunate enough to provide sound for four fully functioning DJ circles and have been climbing the ranks of being allowed to mix with their respective crews. I hope one day we can also organize a reddit meetup so that we can have friendly DJ battles, a general feel good, socially awkward, reddit party. thank you all. "	t5_2rddy	True

1352155538.0	12oyzw	How a few friends and I went from bedroom DJ's to hosting the biggest parties in our small town.	beatreynolds	57	7	28	"I see a lot of people on here or beatmatch kind of wondering how to get into the business. So I figured I'd share my success (in my opinion anyways!) story of creating interest where there was none before. Currently me and two of my DJ friends host parties with an average attendance of 150 people, huge for our small town, which I think is even cooler because beforehand girls who wanted to dance would have to travel around 300km to the nearest club. 

Ok, so rewind around 3 years. I love and play bass but no longer desire to play as I know how to play most genres. My friend had just moved back from a place where dance culture is very dominant, and he was a skilled, although old school DJ for around 6 years. He offers to teach me and I love the idea because of my passion for music and it's a new medium in which to play with. He gives me his old set of cdjs and I learn with no visual cues etc.

 Fast forward a bit and we're both having tons of fun just playing for each other, we both get serato. now I have traveled to the closest clubs in the area, like 300-500kms away in each direction, and partied with friends in clubs and noticed that the house DJ's kinda sucked at the basics. trainwrecking, scratching with the track that was playing, playing songs multiple times etc. anyways this gave us the confidence we needed to start a little night in our town. so we talked to the owner of a small local bar, said we wanted one night, we'd advertise ourselves, charge a 5 dollar cover and she'd make a killing on alcohol sales. she agreed after a month of pestering. so our first night of the most basic setup type shows we get about 70 people, mostly friends. 

we did that around 3 times and on the third time we actually put our tiny little pub to capacity with 110 people. the words ""sold out"" on the door made me pretty damn proud. so word of mouth spreads that these nights are a fun change from the nothing that goes on here but people are now complaining about not getting in. we decide to change venues to a conference center in a local hotel. we put a lot of the money we make into bigger speaker rentals because our tiny set will sound like an ipod dock in this giant space. we also start renting some lights and lazers. so we throw a few parties in this place and people are loving it, every time we throw a party we get around a 15% boost in attendance, with the last party getting up to 210ish. the tiny bit of revenue was a bonus (enough over a few shows to cover around half of a set of stanton 150s which are on their way and give me a music boner) but the best part is people telling me we throw the best parties in town and they loved my set during the last show.

 I realize this isn't the same as breaking into an established culture/club or getting a weekly spot as our shows are more like every month and a half. But for me getting people interested is my success. 

ummm TLDR: I'm a proud little DJ who can't tell a story for the life of me.

1359146962.0	179ycu	Had a drunk patron in my booth last night when I took a potty break, temporarily hosed my equipment. LOCK YOUR SCREEN. LFMF.	elysse101	63	17	59	"Background: I'm a resident DJ at a local club that also does a Drag show every night. Typically after I'm done running the Drag part of the evening (which can run between 1-3 hours depending on the night and event) I have GOT to exit the booth and find a bathroom. It happens. The booth is elevated from the floor, and has access from the front via the stage curtain, and from the side via a CLEARLY marked lockable door (that I haven't needed to lock, like, ever): Employees Only.

Here's how it went down. Last night after the drag show, I was preparing for a much needed potty mission. Loaded a 7+ minute track, and out I went. As I was exiting I noticed a weekend regular begin to move in the direction of the booth. This is a regular who always asks for venue-inappropriate or just downright shitty tracks, and is typically drunk. I know other Club DJs know this feel. I was not ready to hear a request for Tammy Wynette or Beyonce with a full bladder so I quickly ducked out before she could make it to the booth. 

When I got back a full 3 minutes later, she was not only in the booth, but also trying to cue up some track she had found in my collection. Touching. My. Equipment. She'd also managed to peg the CPU, so what *was* playing was stuttering and skipping. She was so drunk that she had no idea I was in the booth yelling at her, and when I finally physically pushed her off my decks she began berating me.

The rage. Oh, the rage.

Here's what came out of my mouth next: ""I don't come to your place of business and slap the dicks out of your mouth- don't try to come up here and do MY job."" Grabbed the mic: ""Security to the DJ booth."" She was kicked out, not quietly. Later, her friends came up and apologized on her behalf. I had to throw some cd in the CDJs while I put my own setup back into working order. Spent the rest of the night keeping my own volatility in check, but otherwise everything went alright. It could have been so much worse.

TL;DR- here is what I have learned, that I would like to share with r/DJs: **lock your laptop screens if you step away from your rig for any amount of time**. I really couldn't have prevented her from getting into my booth, but I could have made it more difficult for her to use my stuff. I could have prevented much buttHz."	t5_2rddy	True

I've been DJing professionally for quite a few years now. I've had some good gigs and some not so good gigs. I don't claim to be a superstar but I am content with my position on the ladder. I get paid to do something I love.

I have a lot of time for people that are a) just getting into DJing and b) DJ simply for the love of the music. I will try and help or advise anyone that was help and advice as did my peers when I was starting out.

That being said, I can't stand people that DJ simply because they want to be a 'DJ'. You know the kind, more interested in getting pictures of themselves DJing than actually DJing and hanging off any 'big name' they can find.

Over the past week one such person has caught my attention. I have him as a friend on Facebook through some loose connection. He's the kind of guy that if I put up something about Traktor he'll reply with ""Traktors shit use Serato"" like he's got some form of knowledge on the subject.

A couple of months back he was on another DJ I knows status, this time asking him for 'DJ lessons'.

My gripe with him started last week. He put up a link to a mix he'd put on Soundcloud. Nothing wrong with that except for on his profile picture he'd put up a shot of some CDJ2000's and DJM900. I commented on the link saying, jokingly ""didn't realise you had 2000's *winky face*"" to my surprise he claimed he did! This guy can't even afford to drive yet can drop £4000 on decks.... Then when I asked why he hasn't got a picture because they clearly weren't his and he replied with ""they're not actually my ones they're my friend Ollies"" so I did a little digging and low and behold, page 3 of a google images search for CDJ2000's there they were. Following the link the set up belonged to a guy called 'Dutch Tommy'. When presented with this information he simply said it was an image he had on his computer and had assumed it must be his friends. When I asked for a picture of his set up he was apparently out of town all week.

Then this week I get a message from him asking for support for his new DJ page on Facebook. On there he has a sound clip of 'him' dropping a track with Datsik at a London club on Friday night. 

After some digging I find that Datsik was actually in Houston, USA on Friday night and the clip is on his FB page from a gig he did in America the week before.

Now I know I shouldn't let this wind me up and the sensible thing to do would be to just delete him from Facebook but I have an overwhelming urge to out him and his lies.

It's hard enough for DJs to get through the ranks, play shitty gigs and try and develop your talent without dicks like this.

As with any creative endeavor you have to be able to cop critique. Take it on the chin. If you're going to put yourself out there, then expect some flak. It seems on this subreddit folks get rather upset if you don't tow the PLUR line.


There's an overwhelming tendency for folks on this subreddit to get butthurt when you don't hold their hand and say ""there, there ... it's all cool man.You're doing fine and your mixes are great."" 

In hip hop and JA dancehall culture talent was fostered by competition. The necesity to better yourself to rise above the average DJ ... around here it's like a kindergarten where people get sheltered from any harshness or real critical feedback.

1332051381.0	r1rv2	r/DJs, You want connections? We needs a community map to make that happen.	shuritsen	50	2	31	"I always hear how to be a succesful DJ, its about WHO you know as much as WHAT you know. Both of those traits go hand in hand, and i've no doubt the majority of this subreddit knows what theyre doing when.theyre gigging at that party, wedding, bar, etcetera, you get my point.
What i'm trying to say is, some of the times, DJs dont always get a chance to make connections after their gigs, and they dont always get a chance to get some publicity . Ive come across a couple subreddits, such as on r/seduction, who've had this map thing called a ""community walk"" or something, where people from all over post their location so that people from close by that participate in that subreddit's activities could meet up and do whatever it is their subreddit does, and now that our subreddit's hit 5,000 subscribers, i think now would be a good chance to get started, and what i plan the point of this to be, is for us to place our location and social networking on the map, and meet up with local DJ's from around our area, compose events, sell their equipment, house parties, have DJ duos, battles, etc, hell, even to help out a struggling amateur turntablist. whatever you feel like. And with this, connections could be built at least twice as fast, and even faster if multiple DJs from same areas composed large events for publicity and even money. So in a way, this community map could help our subreddit get the publicity that some, if not most of our subscribers need and crave.
Sorry for the block of text, but what do you say, r/DJs? Wanna team up, help eachother out, make some good, possibly life-changing connections and even a couple friends you didnt even know could probably be right next door?
Shoot, if this even passes, the map should be posted on the sidebar so everyone signs up, and anyone that ISNT even a dj or whatever can just come here to look for a DJ to cover their party or whatever, or be a substitute headliner dj because the original headliner feels sick. You never know.

I normally spin DnB, but have a shit ton of different tracks I have been collecting for the past 20 years or so.
Anywho, the coworker invites me to bring my shit  over to their practice room which is in a barn. It's painted all black with mirrors. There are lasers, lighting and a kick ass PA.
The guy I work with plays bass, which there were a few to choose from and it turns out the guitar player plays drums and there is a small electronic drum kit in the room. They don't really know much about EDM.
I hooked my equipment up and loaded up a jump up
track for a sound test.  
I started the track as we were bullshitting and they were getting there instruments ready.
And that was the beginning of some beautiful shit, and by beautiful shit, I mean 2 straight hours of fucking shit up. 
The drummer picked up the math and was drumming the breaks and creating his own fills, the bass player was using a fret-less bass and could mimic the bass lines. They added vocals, usually to compliment the samples being played by me.
I was basically a fucking drum machine on crack for them, they loved it.
The shit is I was reading them like a crowd and dropping tracks from all over my collection, DnB, Gabber, Glitch, even some fucking french freakbeat I mixed in.

I keep a 4GB thumb drive on my keychain always. It has about 5 of my favorite DJ sets along with Recordbox, Serato and Traktor analyze files.

I can't even remember how many gigs I just happen on because I just happen to be at a party or club, not there to DJ but as a guest and for one reason or another they need or want me to DJ and because either the venue has CDJ 2000's or a laptop running either Serato, Traktor or Recordbox I've been able to DJ even though I never planned on DJ'ing that night. It also serves as one of my backups incase my normal setup ever fails me.

So you can see what I'm gettin at, if you haven't already, I highly recommend keeping on of these on you at all times. Protip #205 ;)"	t5_2rddy	True

HPPD2	60	11	28	"There are other subreddits for this, and frankly it seems r/DJs doesn't want to listen to your 2 hour brostep mix and there are a lot of submissions on the front page all with negative votes.

So can we tone it down with the mix submissions and try to post some more real content to make this subreddit a little more engaging?

Edit: I'm glad I'm not the only one. Honestly I think this subreddit would be 10x better if all mix submissions were done away with and there was a note on the sidebar to take them to r/mixes and then only have one mix of the month thread but no normal mix submissions here. Half of the time people are crossposting their mixes here from r/dubstep and r/mixes anyway and it just spams the front page with stuff no one comes here to see, and to be honest most of them are pretty sub par.

You can listen to the interview here: http://djbusinessman.com/blog/the-dj-businessman-podcast-episode-1-growing-a-4-person-dj-company-with-warren-pletcher/.

I'm putting together the handbook as we speak, and I plan to keep on putting out free content and interview podcasts in the meantime.

[Source](http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/06/pioneer-cdj-2000nexus-updates-the-flagship-dj-player/)

&gt;""Beat sync renders the decks useless... but any DJ with credibility wouldn t really want to stand behind these in a club?!""
&gt;incorrect.
&gt;
&gt;i'm really tired of this trope, it's mostly swung around by people who aren't half-decent DJs and need something to separate them and put them above the newbies. Nobody cares if the deck has sync. It doesn't matter. Beatmatching is a technical skill, it's not a talent, and it's not what people come to the club for. Freeing up your time to do more live remixing, etc. is a Big Deal.
&gt;
&gt;Shit DJs will be shit DJs always and will have ways to lazy themselves out of having to mix properly. I'm glad they'll have the option of sync, so when I go to a club I don't need to listen to an opener that's drowning out the sound of his trainwrecks with that goddamned airhorn sample anymore. And for those of us who enjoy the art, this coupled with a DJM2000/RMX1000 or a laptop running ableton suddenly gives a lot more options for creative performance. I play on four decks reasonably well, but spend a LOT of time tending to them as even the tightest beatmatch on 6% eventually drifts enough to be audible.
&gt;
&gt;Sync is a tool that lets you reduce that load. It won't always do it right, it won't make a bad DJ good, but it will allow those of us who really put in the time and effort to free up our hands a little to do all the other cool stuff the new breed of kit lets us do. if you think freeing DJs up to do more than spend their time matching tempos is 'killing the art' then you're one of the folks who's probably actually neutering it. It also gives you lots of creative options that simply can't be done by hand - I'd like to see you slow down two tracks in sync by 10% or more to shift genres during a break while still keeping percussion synced up - you can't do it accurately. It's just not feasible.
&gt;
&gt;I've been at this 10+ years now. I've played vinyl, I've played on controllers, I've played on many different versions of the CDJ, I've played in ableton, and I can say that I welcome every new improvement and opportunity to do new and exciting things with open arms. It's not a threat, it doesn't diminish the fun I have or the quality of what I do.
&gt;
&gt;This whole sync argument reeks of people trying to create an exclusive club to keep new people out. I've seen the same exact voices cropping up bitching about pioneer's new low cost controllers/standalone units and saying that the barrier to entry for DJing is getting too low - well GOOD. I hope it does. I hope that people who never thought about DJing before start flooding in and kicking ass. I hope they run circles around all the folks who keep complaining about every new innovation as the downfall of the art and I hope that they drive new technology and ideas into the scene.
&gt;
&gt;I just hope they don't play le7els - that's not too much to ask, is it?
&gt;
&gt;**TL;DR**, sync is only a problem to people who think beat matching is what makes a DJ, and those people probably aren't that good anyway.

1342457798.0	wng71	Mixed in key and why I DON'T recommend it or anything like it...	NotAtTheTable	71	25	109	"I got mixed in key about 6 months ago thinking it was the greatest thing ever, and how it was going to vastly improve my mixing, make it sound cleaner, allow for better mashups, yadda yadda yadda.

I went forward, pushed all my songs through it, grabbed the keys, and it was magical, no more clashing of tunes, the songs all played well over each other, and I thought I had found the next step in improving my mixing.

As I continued to practice though, I realized a lot of songs were following each other often, and that I began to feel like only certain songs fit together. I would search for songs based on key (1a, 2a, 3b, etc) instead of what would sound good next.

It got to the point where mixed in key was basically picking the songs for me and I was growing more and more afraid of going outside the box and picking a song that wasn't one step away on the camelot system. 

It became so frustrating I didn't practice for quite awhile because every time I sat down to make a mix it either sounded the exact same as the one the day before or the songs, although in the same key, lacked the proper flow and made the mix sound like a mess (in the correct key though...).

Two days ago I was fed up with it all and had had enough. I got 30 some odd new songs and decided I wasn't going to touch mixed in key and just trust my ear (I've had countless years of musical training, why I didn't just trust this from the start I've no idea). I did something novel, I would compare the tracks in the headphones before playing it live through the speakers and decide if it sounded correct before using it, instead of letting a program decide for me.

I made the best mix I've made in months, mixed for an hour, danced in my room alone, and had an amazing jam out time. Is the mix perfect, no. Am I looking forward to attempting it again, abso-freaking-lutely. I had so much fun yesterday and felt so free, expressing the songs as feelings more than in key copies of each other. It was so...much...fun and felt *right* again.

Guys, don't get mixed in key. Just learn what sounds good. Your ear is a powerful thing, trust it.

tl;dr mixed in key can trap you, your ears free you, use your ears."	t5_2rddy	True

Naturally i asked for a couple CDJ's (AA Radius 1000) this holiday to, hopefully, complete my set up and start learning real DJ technique on some decks. Well my wish came halfway true and i got one of those beautiful CD players. When i opened it my parents were so excited to see what it did and how i would use it to DJ. They were so funny about how intrigued they were, it took every ounce of will power not to slip a ""well with two i can..."". I love them more than anything so i could never be upset with any gift they give me, i see their love and desire to make their children happy in every gift and wide eyed stare as we tear the paper, they are just a bit oblivious! :P But this is a step closer to having a real set up!

Because it was meant to be an Animal House-inspired toga party, he suggested I include the music from the movie, and anything in the style of. So Isley Bros, Sam &amp; Dave, etc.

But I also know him, and his friends, to be a bunch of hipster and EDM fans, so I made sure I had plenty of dance-remixes of Crystal Castles, Arcade Fire, 2 Door Cinema Club... pretty much a Hype Machine remixes greatest hits album.

I also made sure to get remixes of the Animal House songs. Imagine if Madeon remixed the AH soundtrack, that's what I looked for.

So I would start with something like ""Shout"", and then bring up the EDM remix, and do my best to bring in the remix about 2/3 of the way into the original song. People loved it. I'd do this for an hour or so, then I'd automix a bunch of songs I wasn't as familiar with (but where liked by the host) and hang out, swim, eat, drink, then I'd return to the deck and do it again with ""Hold On, I'm a-Comin'"".

Was told 2 days ago i needed to DJ a house party with about 30 people or so and they wanted EDM (what i love to play) so im all down for it and happy as fuck.

Get there and set up and start how i normally like to start with prog house, about 2 hours later (8pm) only 13 people have shown up and it stayed like that for the whole night. They said they wanted to hear old school rock and aussie hip hop which i didnt have a problem doing but i was really looking forward to busting out a full on proper EDM set. Not only that but i was told time turn it down to such a low volume i could barely even hear it and i was better off just using headphones and on top of that i was told to shut it off at 11PM!!!. Nobody danced nobody gave a fuck, an ipod would of been better for this and i feel really annoyed and pissed off.

**1. You are not there for you.  You are there for them.**
If you're not paying attention to who is there and how they are reacting to what you are playing, you should be.  All crowds are different, even from day to day, hour to hour at the same place.  Just because you downloaded track you can't stop listening to, it might not be the right time for that when you go on.   Listen to what they want to hear.

**Edit 1.5 Never have a setlist**
NEVER have a pre-programmed set.  You really don't know what you are gonna play.  What if the previous DJ played your bombtrack?  What if they're just not responding to your tracks?  You'll need to improvise.   Clients ask me all the time what I am going to play first, and I tell them I won't know till I'm there.  Reading a crowd that can change in a heartbeat is what being a good DJ is all about

**2. Be able to play on all kinds of equipment**
If you work hard, you will have the opportunity to play in front of lots of people in many different places.  Until you are at the level of a DJ Mag Top 100 DJ, you will likely have to play on whatever hand you are dealt.  Stop being a pussy and learn to mix on something that isn't in your bedroom.  Once you get the basics down, playing on other equipment isn't that hard.  You should be able to figure out how a mixer works in less than 20 seconds in the dark.

**3. Flow is everything**
 if the guy before you is playing house, then your first track shouldn't be brostep.  Learn to transition in and out of sets to keep things smooth for your audience.  Remember, there might be a guy going on after you as well.  Don't fuck up his set by leaving him in a tough spot.  Work together.   This means you need to learn other genres so you know how to get from A to B without too much hard shifting.

**4. Learn to beatmatch by ear. **
I don't give a shit what the software does or can do.  Chemistry student learn how atoms bond with each other down to theory level.  Of course there are computer programs available that can do all the calculating and measuring for Chemists, but it's still necessary that they understand what the computer is doing.   Djing is only 50% JUST playing tracks... the 50% is how you put those tracks together.  Anyone can play a track.  

If you don't bother to learn how to do it by ear, then you have missed out on MANY important lessons that you can ONLY learn by learning how to do it by ear.  I can't begin to describe to you how many little things you'll learn just by doing it.   I was fortunate that I was forced to learn how to do it by ear, because and I can sample, mix, loop and drop into tracks more intuitively and more successfully than people who rely on SYNC.  Plus, I'm quicker on the draw than someone who simply relies on software or other visual aids.  More importantly, if something goes wrong, I can fix a problem much faster than someone who can't rely on their ears.  Screengazing is a crutch and using it will limit your potential. 

**5. Programming is everything**
Playing the right music at the right time for the right people is the MOST important part of your skillset.  If your tracks are awesome and your flow or timing sucks, it doesn't matter how well you put them together. Depending on what is played before you go on, you might need to start there are lead the crowd to where you want to go.   This goes back to learning how to read a crowd.  If you're the opening DJ, you have no business playing the most requested tracks of the night.  Your job is to warm up the audience for whomever is playing prime-time.   Do this well enough, and you'll be asked to headline.   That being said, also be aware of what time it is.  It isn't always a good time for your favorite tracks.  

**6. Charge what your worth**
Yeah, I get it.  You love doing it, we all do.  That doesn't mean you should do it for free.  Some of us have put more hours than you can imagine into buying records, sifting through shitty tracks online, learning how to beatmatch, buying equipment, playing in dive bars, spending hours promoting ourselves, getting ripped off by shitty promoters and owners.  That means, when we do land gigs,  we want top dollar for appearing in a club.  Just because you've never dreamed of earning 200.00 in one day doesn't mean you should go undercut another DJ and tell the owner you will DJ for drink tickets.  Have some respect for yourself and your craft.

**7. Respect the booth**
If it isn't your equipment, protect it like your own.  If you aren't supposed to touch it, don't. 

**8. Close your mouth and open your ears**
 Dj's love to pick each other apart, so when you are out and not spinning, instead of trashing the guy who is spinning, try to enjoy your drink and conversation with your friends.  Listen, you might learn a thing or two.    

**9. Support the industry or it won't support you.**
Just because you know how to download an illegal copy of Virtual DJ and Fruityloops and a sample pack doesn't mean you are a producer.  Learn to compress your own drums.  Tweak your own basslines.  Sync your own vocals.  After you've spent thousands of hours learning to produce and jumped through all of hoops you need to jump through to get signed by a label, tell me how much you don't mind people downloading it for free when it is for sale on beatport.

In addition to this, PAY FOR YOUR MUSIC.  If you truly love the music, then you won't mind paying for it.  If you don't support the artists by paying for their hard work, they may get dropped from a label or get discouraged altogether thinking no one likes their work.   

**10. Buy quality, you'll never regret it.**
My mobile DJ rig costs as much as a new car.  I could easily be a DJ for FAR less, but I do not ever want to outgrow my equipment, OR have it fail on me after minimal use.  Buy cheap speakers and you'll always sound like shit.

**11.  Pay it forward**
* I'm passing along things that were taught to me, and you should do the same.  Technology has made DJing very accessible, and now everyone is a DJ.  The more people that think violating all of the aforementioned principals, the faster the art of DJing will lose respect as a whole.    It will garner you respect, though make sure you don't teach all of your soldiers all of your tricks... or you will fall victim to yourself.


**EDIT**
For clarification : I am a full time professional DJ and I make a good living doing it.  It's been a lot of work.  I started 12 years ago in the clubs in Philadelphia and Atlantic City and have played alongside many talented individuals.  I now live in Chicago and perform wedding weekly for brides and grooms who want something other than the status quo cheeseball DJ.  I started out on turntables, but I now use a laptop, MIDI controller and mixer.  I don't have a problem with things like Hercules or other starter controllers, they are great for starters. but you can only go so far and do so much with them, and they are not professional grade devices.

I have been DJing for a few years now, doing gigs clubs and bars, as well as bringing out my own system and playing at friends' house parties. I've gotten pretty close to the few people that I end up working all the time, and I'll occasionally let them use my sound equipment for parties as well. Recently, one of my buddies borrowed my gear to play a party that was going to be just him and possibly one other dj that I hadn't met. I decided to stop by to say what's up, and what I saw bothered me.

[rant]

The dj that I hadn't met before used Traktor, and had a main controller, as well as a separate controller mapped specifically for effects. None of that is bad, but the way he utterly dominated the flow of each song with a cacophony of beatmashes/gater/filter/anything else you can imagine combos was unreal. Each button controlled several layers of effects, which were then used with a very ""more is more"" kind of approach. It was even more awkward because the way he was cutting between tracks didn't seem to take the phrasing of either track into account -- just hit sync, and cut levels/swap/slather with effects.

Then I thought to myself, ""Hey, that's all fine and good, people are allowed to do things that I don't agree with or like."" But it gets worse.

My friend and I have similar setups, and he had been playing on and off since early afternoon and wanted a break, so he asked if I'd like to take over for him when he was up next. 15 minutes later I cued up and swapped over from the other new dj dude into my own set. Not 3 minutes into the first track, the fucking dude grabs the outgoing levels slider on my mixer and starts beat chopping. While I'm playing. Instant confrontation. Obviously I told him to back the fuck off, which he did, but then he comes back with the argument that I should ""make myself useful"", that I'm not ""doing anything"" when I just stand up there and ""press play."" (gratuitous use of quotation marks, I know -- just wanted to let you know those were direct quotes) ...which is completely untrue, considering I'm not using sync, beatmatching on my own, and picking tracks that the party might actually want to hear instead of just playing everything off of a super sweet pre-set playlist.

My argument was that I wanted to give the party a beat to dance to; I wasn't sitting in my basement experimenting with what I could get away with, and that just because a dj chooses to busy their hands laying effects over the top of tracks instead of beat matching or laying an acapella over or whatever, didn't mean I wasn't doing anything. I know there is a time and a place for effects, but in my opinion, they're kinda like frosting on cake -- too much just utterly fucking ruins it.

He was very upset with this notion, and left with a roll of the eyes. A bit later, he returned demanding that I let him back on, as people has started dancing, and he had been ""playing to an empty dance floor all day."" I guess I wanted to watch him go down in flames, so I let him on, and everyone cleared off again. He was furious, and made a big show of taking all of his gear and leaving, without bothering to stay and help take down any of the sound equipment that he had been using that day.

And look, I know house parties are a good place to mess around with new techniques because they're pretty low-pressure situations, but I was just angry with this kid. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion/style/whatever, but as soon as you start preaching to someone else about how what you do or think is better, that's when conflicts are gonna arise. The evidence was there. How can you not notice that your style sends people running?

[/rant]

TL;DR: Bad attitude + bad style + inflated ego = never play with this guy again. Also, if I'm playing, don't fucking touch my mixer."	t5_2rddy	True

NotAtTheTable	48	6	80	"Saturday night I hopped on to DJ with a friend of mine during his set (we had planned this ahead of time). I started playing remixes of popular songs because ""if you don't play popular stuff the owner will shut you off, cause he's a dick."" 

I then get 2 songs, 2 SONGS IN, everyone's dancing and having an awesome time and I got word that I needed to play rap. I then play a Dr. Dre song, no remix, which everyone was enjoying and dancing to and the place was packed! 

Then I move to another rap song and everyone is still dancing and having a great time (no seriously, the crowd was digging it). The owner then shut us off. I couldn't believe it and was seriously disgusted. Anyone else experience anything similar? 

Apparently I didn't play enough ghetto rap for a club full of country bumpkins in Texas and especially not enough mainstream rap for the owner, who gave me about 15 minutes before he shut me off...everyone beware, reading the crowd is important, but feeding the selfish needs of a bar/club owner is paramount to continuing a set.

Edit: The issue with me not talking with the manager was the setup was through a friend. It was his set, but I came down to DJ a house party for him and we were then both going to relocate to the bar and spin there. He had his songs and I had mine and he said mine would be fine and that ""it would be sick."" Turns out he was very wrong.

**Chill-Ass Bride**: You hear a ton of stories about Bridezilla. Unless you do something additional to piss her off the bride she is chill as a cucumber. She was a Bridezilla last week so she could be chill today.

**Lost Groom**: This cat doesn't know what the fuck is going on and is just going through the motions. Give him a good time.

**The Best Friends**: These people know the bride and groom better than anybody, and are generally in the wedding party. As DJ, make them your best friends and you won't regret it.

**Fail-Parents**: Speech goes like this, ""SO happy for you two, wish you the best"".

**Cool Parents**: Give a sick speech with hilarious stories, but keeps it concise.

**Slutty Bridesmaid**: Drunk level: immediate

**Hot but Classy Bridesmaid**: Takes care of Slutmaid

**40 year old women who want to be twenty**: Will request old hip-hop/disco/classic rock, and will dance with their posse of soccer moms. Probably the most fun people at the wedding.

**Former DJ**: ""I Dj'ed for 5 years in the 80s, trust me I know what these kids want""

**Drunk BFF**: Thinks he's your fucking brother. Play one of his requests and he will buy you a drink.

**Random Hotties**: Black dresses, high heels, they get to dress up and get drunk. These are the ones you should 'get to know' (during a long song of course)

**The Couple**: Two things will happen. Either they will tear up the floor when you throw down a slow song (they took ballroom lessons and this is their only chance to show off), or the guy will eye you up all night for being a studly predator of his woman.

**Old People**: (About Lady Gaga) TURN THIS RAP MUSIC DOWN!

My Personal Favourite:

**Good Guy Wedding Attendee**: Probably friends with groom but not overtly close. He gets what you are doing and appreciates it. Play his requests often, he knows the crowd. He will hook you up with drinks and girls, but also knows when you have to be in your element.

here's the story:

Three years ago this night club opened up in my town (Eugene, OR) and my friend got hired to DJ there on Saturday's. The place was poorly managed, the music wasn't good, bartenders were inexperienced. They would maybe have 20 people inside between 11-1 (peak hours). Anyways, I suggested to my friend that he convince the owner to let me share the night with him and that I could bring new flavor to the table since every DJ currently there as strictly house and electro and I had a vast knowledge of hip-hop, top-40 and more classic party jam type of stuff. I do a guest spot on Saturday and we had maybe 50 people in there between 11-1, I get asked to come back next week and try again. This time there were 70 people between 11-1 and this kept going for a few weeks until I was asked to be hired on as a permanent resident with my friend every Saturday. Everyone liked me and everything was going just fine. We got a flat rate of $150 each no matter the outcome of the night. Fast forward one year. We now have 400-500 people coming through the door every night, they had to bring on more bartenders, hire security, etc. The reputation of the club changed, word of mouth was there was a DJ on Saturday's who played rap, rock, party music and not just only flat line 128 bpm electro and house all night. The club started charging a cover at the door now since it was getting pretty busy every Saturday (keep in mind they have DJ's every day of the week there, 7 days, Friday's are still dead because one of the owners DJ's that night and refused to play any top-40 or anything current or relevant even with electro and house, he is older and set in his ways) So, now they have a cover at the door, we're still getting $150 each a night no matter what. I start asking to negotiate a raise, they are extremely hesitant but understand my logic. Months go by and they are still blowing me off about the raise, eventually they come up with a tier system and it is something a long these lines: if the bar gets under $1,000 in sales you get $100 to split between the two DJ's, if it's $1,001-$1,800 you get $150, if it's $1,801-2,400 you get $225, etc, etc, etc. all the way up to $5,400 you get a total of $520 to split between two DJ's and it's capped there, nothing more. It wasn't an ideal situation and I said it would work for now, they agreed it was flawed and they would work on changing it soon. Anyways, another year goes by now we're getting over 600 people through the door on an average Saturday. The cover is now up to $5 per person, before it was $1-3 when they first implemented a cover a year before. I start getting booked around town more and more on my nights off, I have a reputation growing and a good following. The owners tell me I can't work anywhere else within a 5 block radius of their club and told me to quit my other jobs. I ask for more money and better terms and they refuse. Meanwhile, Saturday's are making more at the door and bar than any other night combined. Friday's are doing a 1/5th as well as Saturday. I tell them I need a raise or the ability to work at other places and that their offer isn't fair. They refuse, a year goes by and I am now fired for working at another bar on Friday's.

I helped make this business successful. I changed the image from a weird night club that only 20 weirdos would go to on a Saturday to the premier spot in my town. Everyone that knows me knows it, the owners know it, the other DJ's know it. Yet, they got greedy when the money started rolling in and I got tanked.

I asked for 10% of bar and 25% of the door, and that would be split between me and the other DJ on Saturday (whom since getting me hired I had to teach how to mix hip-hop, how to program a night effectively, how to read a crowd. All while he used my $4,000 set-up for three years that I solely invested in straight because he didn't own anything other than a lap-top.)

Now that I'm fired after building this business, I don't know what to do. What can I do? What should I do? Tell me everything is going to be ok, tell me I'm pretty, make me feel special :-(

EDIT: to be clear this place is owned by two people and they have an unusual business arrangement. One guy used to own a restaurant and has always wanted to own a night club so he meets the other guy who is a small record shop owner and has only had one permanent residency in his life in which he got fired from many years ago and has always since then wanted to own his own club and do it his own way. The way it's set-up is the restaurant guy hires and trains bartenders and security and the record shop guy hires the dj's. restaurant guy get's his money from the bar sales and he pays the dj's since dj's get zero of the door there. record shop guy keeps door. i think i mentioned before, on a average Saturday 2k at the door, 5-6k at the bar. we get 520, split in half is 260 each, nothing more since we have hit the cap every Saturday since they implemented the new pay system with tier levels. The business will be just over three years next month and I was told by one of the owners they will be completely out of debt any moment. Also,  I would like to add that about one and a half years ago they bought out this small business connecting to their bar and tore down the wall to build a lounge and put in pool tables, couches, arcade games and what not and to increase capacity of the space by 30 or something."	t5_2rddy	True

1363055381.0	1a4g6f	A little anecdote about reading the crowd vs. playing what you were hired for (story time/rambling)	PokeSomeSmot	45	8	20	"So last weekend I was booked to play at an underground rave up in the Bay Area (it was called So Stoked 7) - the promoter originally contacted me to play vocal and uplifting trance. I'm a big fan of this type of music, and I'm pretty confident with it, so I accepted.

Show starts at 9, I'm on from 11-12 in the second (not main) room. The DJ before me is spinning progressive and electro house, lots of Zedd and Porter.. that grimy stuff. The crowd's loving it, even though the room was advertised as the trance room. He's finishing out his set, and judging from the jumping, sweaty, smiling crowd, they're diggin this stuff. So do I blindly jump in with the trance that I prepared? Naw. I listen to my gut and throw [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aek0WXEfM80) track down. 

And I'm off! I start off with this sort of electrohouse, and gradually transition into vocal trance towards the end of my hour. Ramp up the BPM from 128 to 134, and my last track ended up being the club remix of [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb94nSQIuSg)

So what's the point of this post? I guess I just wanted to reiterate that it's good practice to be able to think on your toes. To move with the crowd. To give them what they need, and to take them where they want to be.

The set was amazing, raver kids throwing hand hearts and shouting ""WE LOVE YOU TOO"" when I told them how exactly I felt about them all :]

I think I started feeling a little raver rain towards the end of the set, too! Haha. Disgusting and beautiful. I love my job.

[Oh and if anyone wants a taste of what I spun, I saved the tracklist and played the set again a couple days later](http://www.mixcloud.com/tofuya116/2013-03-01-dj-daeman-so-stoked-7/)"	t5_2rddy	True

1336997272.0	tmch1	DAE using a laptop use scripts/automation to speed up setup?	fffiiissshhh	46	7	39	"I used OS X's Automator to automate a workflow into a little ""app"" that basically turns on DJ Mode.  When I double click the application icon, my laptop does the following:  

* Quits all programs, except Traktor, iTunes (as backup in case Traktor fails), and [Caffeine](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/) (keeps your screen from dimming)
* Runs [Purge](http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/39777/purge), an app that clears out/frees up RAM
* Runs an applescript that opens Caffeine (if not already open) and turns it on (I have it set to 5 hours)
* Opens and activates [InsomniaX](http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/22211/insomniax), a little application that tells the computer to do nothing if the lid is closed (found this in another r/djs thread!)
* Sets iTunes volume to 0
* Opens Traktor if not already open

This saves several minutes and a lot of hassle during setup, during which time I can connect and check all my cables, controllers, and gear.  I double click the app, my computer enters DJ mode, and by the time I'm done setting up other stuff, Traktor is full screen, my laptop isn't running other intensive processes, and I'm ready to go.  

If anyone's interested, I can upload the workflow or application somewhere - it's about 2MB as an app.

**Edit** [Uploaded here](http://www.mediafire.com/?708jw76h99pf7a6), two files: a workflow (if you want to make changes - then *make sure to save it as an application after you're done*) and an application (if you like it as is.) 

* Download all the apps i've linked above and install them for it to work
* With Insomnia X youll need to set it to activate on launch in its own preferences, or else youll have to manually activate it
* REMEMBER TO QUIT INSOMNIAX WHEN YOURE DONE - YOU CAN OVERHEAT YOUR LAPTOP IF YOU CLOSE IT AFTER A GIG AND IT STAYS ON.
 

Would highly recommend poking around and editing in automator because everyone has different preferences.  Some of the comments have a lot of good suggestions.

1314139843.0	js8eq	5 Simple Steps to Becoming a Superstar DJ (Sarcasm)	omers	48	10	37	"I posted this to another site a while back, tweaked it up a bit and figured I'd share it with you guys.

------
**Step 1 : Choose a DJ Name**

This step is easy, all you need to do is grab a dictionary and pick a random word (I chose Aardvark because I didn't feel like flipping very many pages). Replace at least one letter with a number (eg. 4ardvark). Slap ""DJ"" in front and you're off to the races.

**Final Product:** DJ 4ardvark

**Pro-Tip:** To make it even more epic use ""DeeJay"" instead.

------
**Step 2 : Decide what you want to play**

Chose at least 8 genres right off the bat because mastery of one or two takes too long. Besides, it will make you look like a super star when you tell people ""I spin House, Electro, Dub Step, Speed Garage, Nu-NRG, Breaks, Rotterdam, and Goa.""

**Pro-Tip:** Learn how to drop random tracks from one genre into another because cohesion isn't exciting. You can accomplish this by mashing the breakdown from a house track into the intro of a dubstep (don't worry about beatmatching, you're too cool for that now.)

**Pro-Tip:** The more pretentious your music selection the better, eg: ""I only spin House from Chicago that was produced between 1986 and 1987; all other house music is crap.""

------
**Step 3 : Actually get the music**

Remember that with the advent of the internet paying for music is no longer necessary. Grab yourself a copy of Limewire or Bearshare and go to town. 

Don't worry about the rumours you've heard; 128Kbps sounds awesome on huge sound systems. 320Kbps is just going to take up precious room on your hard drive that you'll need for you're eight genres from Step 2.

**Pro-Tip:** 96Kbps will save even more hard drive space.

------
**Step 4 : Pirate a copy of Virtual DJ**

Atomix, the company that makes Virtual DJ never intended for people to pay for their software; The $329 price tag was just an April Fools joke that they forgot to take down. Pop open your Limewire and download a copy, it's what all the superstars do.

Virtual DJ is awesome because we get to skip a whole bunch of steps like ""Learn to Beatmatch"" thanks to things like the Sync button. Serato and Traktor are looked down upon in the vast majority of DJ circles for being too stable, if there isn't a chance your software could crash at any moment you're not living it up.

**Pro-Tip:** When you post your mixes to Youtube use a static image of a set of turntables. You don't want people to know what awesome software you're using, and you don't want to offend all of those DJs that haven't caught up with the times and are still using old antiquated technology. 

------
**Step 5 : Make your presence known around town**

- Go to clubs and parties in your area. 
- Wait until the DJ that is spinning has his headphones on (this is a sign that he's ready to talk).
- Tap him on the shoulder and wait for him to give you the ""thank you for taking my mind of this mix"" glare of appreciation.
- Tell him ""Hey man, I's a DJ too"". (Be sure to tell him that the remix he's playing right now is good and all but that the ""Club Mix"" on Youtube would probably have gone over better because it has 1million views and 50,000 thumbs up.)
- Wait for the praise and acceptance that is due to you.

**Pro-Tip:** Tell him how the CDJs he's using are a nice piece of kit but you prefer the older model because the newer models are too fancy and take away from real DJing or go on at length about why Pioneer is over rated and clubs should switch to Behringer and Numark. 

------
**Steps you may have heard elsewhere that are actually not necessary:**

- **Practising**: You're awesome, why would you need to practice? Besides, you'll be too busy having sex with hot women. 

- **Learning to Beatmatch**: That's what the sync button is for. Those DJs at the club who beatmatch don't have enough time to do lines of coke off the shooter girl, but you do!

- **Learning to Phrase**: The faster you can bung tracks together the more tracks you can play. Peaks and valleys are boring - the music should be banging all night. NO BREAKDOWNS!

------
**Bonus Tips:** 

- If you want your Youtube videos to be popular make sure you have a strobe light, a mask of some sore, and can dance like a chav on meth.

- All good DJ's change their name on Facebook to say ""&lt;Firstname&gt; DJWhatever &lt;Lastname&gt;"" because everyone you interact with needs to know you're a DJ and getting people to join a separate page actually dedicated to your DJ work takes too much effort.

- The more items clothing you have with logos like ""Technics"" and ""Rane"" on them the better.

- Always introduce yourself as ""DJ &lt;whatever&gt;,"" starting today your real name is meaningless. 

- **When in doubt: JESUS POSE!**

------

Once you have completed these steps gigs and girls will fall in to your lap with no effort at all!

Party on you awesome DJ you.

1308713720.0	i5vmf	How *not* to get a DJing gig.	noobprodigy	44	4	13	"So I live in a small city and just started throwing events. I finished school, have some time and some money to put into it. I know a lot of the local DJs and formed a crew of most of the main guys in town. So we had our first event over the weekend. It was not a success due to a lot of factors. Execution of the party was fine, but promotion was an issue, as well as the location. That's not important.

So this guy approaches me, whom I have met once or twice before, by no means is he one of the main DJs in town, and I have been here for 6 years. He had told me on facebook earlier that he was bringing vinyl just in case. I told him I'd be willing to give him an opening slot down the road, but my next couple events are booked up. So at the party he pretty much tells me that he has been playing opening sets in town for years and he is sick of it. He wants a better slot. So he pretty much berates me to give him a better slot, asking what he has to do to get a better slot. I asked for a demo. He said he doesn't do demos, he does live auditions. Ok.... I asked him what his preferred format is, turntables, CDJs, midi controller, what. He won't give me a straight answer, says ""I will use whatever is there"". Ok... I pretty much tell him that I have only seen him play for about 15 minutes before, and I am not comfortable giving him a peak time slot. I left out the part where the one time I did see him play, his beatmatching was off.

So, I ask him what gear he owns. He doesn't own any. He uses his buddy's (a mutual friend). Eventually, he says he will throw a demo together and we can go from there. The next day on facebook, in reference to the party, he said to our mutual friend who had to miss it ""Didn't miss much, that's for sure"".

So, long story short, if you are going to straight up ask for a gig, just fucking go along with whatever the promoter wants from you to get your foot in the door. Don't be confrontational, acting like you deserve it. Most of us have plenty of DJs to choose from, and it won't take much to get put on the ""do not book"" list.

**TL;DR - If you're looking for a gig, don't act like you are entitled to it. It's ok to be persistent, but don't be an asshole, or you will never get booked.**"	t5_2rddy	True

I'll start with a few.

1.) The magic formulas. If I'm mixing house, around 124-132ish, then I know that if track A is 126bpm, and track B is 128 bpm, then they are 1.6% different. 1bpm = 0.8% pitch change in that situation. 126bpm mixing into 130? It needs to be +3.2%.

For dubstep/trap/140 its 0.7% per bpm, for stuff around 100bpm, its obviously 1%, and so on. Its a really useful timesaver to be aware of this, even if on vinyl (where obviously its not as accurate because of the drift with technics). I now almost instinctively know what pitch to set a track at as I'm cueing up, at any tempo, before I've even listened through the headphones, so long as I know the bpm of what is currently playing.

2.) EQing when mixing tracks with vocals. Often if I'm mixing out of a vocal track into an instrumental track, I will trim the bass of the vocal track, and boost the mids (and on a 4-band EQ like Allen &amp; Heath that'll be the upper mids generally), as thats where the meat of the vocal resides. Do this well with tracks that complement each other and you can seamlessly blend vocals into the next track for an extended mix that can almost sound like a studio mashup.

3.) BE PREPARED. There's a reason the scouts had this motto. In my bag I have spare cables that I've never used, and maybe never will. An interface to go between my iPhone and the phono inputs in case everything dies and I need SOMETHING with audio. Blue-tac (very handy for holding earth wires in place when the nut has disappeared from the back of a mixer!). A torch. A small book of CDs in case my laptop conks out. A USB with the same. Wherever I play, I always go and grab a stack of napkins in case a drink gets spilled in the booth. Try to think of every bad thing that could happen, and be ready to deal with it when it happens, because eventually it probably will, and you will be the hero of the hour!

[A Milli - Scotty B Remix](http://soundcloud.com/itsjaredyoh/lil-wayne-a-millie-scottie-b-remix): This song does all the beat ramping for you. The tempo starts at a quick 130 and gradually spirals down to the original tempo (around 76) --- and when that happens, it's a huge drop. 

Or [Oliver S - Doin ya thang](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzV11AUobVg): Creates a lazy, disco vibe to a set, and fucks with the audience in a way that, surprisingly, isn't annoying.

Can anyone else think of 'tool' tracks like these?

After reading around here for a while, something came back to me that I remember from when I used to hang around new DJ's as my main social group.

Many new Djs have incredibly fragile egos and are hyper-competitive at the same time. It seems that at some point they got enough confidence in their skills to challenge other DJs, but are still threatened by the thought that other DJs are getting gigs that they are not. 

I often see groups of DJs standing near the decks, talking about how they have that track, or how it's too old to be playing, or this DJs style, or how they did not get booked for this gig, or how the promoter is a jerk. Instead of dancing and talking with their friends. 

Now, this is not all DJs, and it seems to be DJs that are less experienced and just getting over the teething stages of playing out. IE. they have had a few gigs, but not so many that they are confident there will be more. 

I'd like to call out to the shit-talker, train-spotting, non-dancing, hater DJs being lame ... 

Give it a rest. Have fun, and talk to a girl (about something other than DJ'ing).

I play different dance music gigs, so I look for everything between 110-140bpm-- house, garage, techno, bass, nu-disco, disco, top40 remix, edits, etc

The key here is LEGAL, such as XLR8R, who are provided promos by either labels or the artists themselves, to be given away for free. Or places that aggregate downloads in one easy place.

Technically making edits/bootlegs and giving them away on Soundcloud/Mediafire is illegal, but at least no money could be exchanged for the track. That's where I draw the line

It was at Stereo, one of the best nightclubs on the planet. I had an hour and a half on stage. I learned something while I was up there:

A big part of what causes world class DJs come to places like this over the competition is because they get treated *like fucking gold*.

At every other club I've spun at, I was an accessory. I got bottles of water when I needed them, but other than that I was pretty much a second-class citizen to the people in charge. The gear is old, sometimes broken, and if something breaks it's my responsibility to make the night work out despite that.

At Stereo, the owners let me pick which of their selection of mixers I wanted to use (I went with a Xone:DB4 because holy fuck), gave me 4 CDJ-2000s and a pair of Tech 12s, a guy on hand at all times to manage cables and other issues and help out when it came time to change over to the next DJ, and to round it all out, another guy waited until I was in a comfortable spot for a quick chat and asked me ""hey man, let me know what you want to drink and i'll make sure you're stocked up"". He honored that offer. At one point one of the CDJs started cutting out, so the owner went into the back room of extra CDJ-2000s (?!?!?!?!?!) and brought out another one. It was unbelievable. Random-ass opening DJs get that kind of treatment? No wonder Danny Tenaglia played a 14 hour set there last week."	t5_2rddy	True

Slowly things started to become less fun, the luster of spinning started to fade. I became bitter at the scene, the promoters, and myself. 

Two weeks went by where I didn't touch a deck. I got back in touch with my love for black metal, I went and saw Phuturprimitve and Shpongle live, I stopped trawling through the blogs for the latest remixes. 

Fastforward to now and I just did what might have been perhaps one of my best sets, and I didn't even plan on playing any of the songs that the crowd and other DJ's loved. Sometimes a break is good, sometimes you just need to stop being a machine and live a little. "	t5_2rddy	True

"	Teaelle	75	34	148	"I'm 21, I've been a producer for 2 and a half years now, and have been completely oblivious to the DJing scene. Now that it's time to promote myself &amp; my music more, I just bought Traktor Kontrol S2 a couple weeks ago, and **I LOVE IT.**

I've been cramming myself with info the last 2 weeks reading tons of stuff on DJ techtools, going through every thread in /r/beatmatch &amp; /r/DJs and learning as much as a possible can. But I'm just really confused as to why the Controller DJ or ""Digital"" DJ is looked down upon. 

I mean seriously? SYNC button gives you all the creative range to loop, cut samples, control FX, play with EQs, have time to think, and from what I hear ""interact with fans"". Because you don't need to worry about beatmatching.. Button of fucking Gods in my books. Sure it's good to learn how to beatmatch but to continue using it when you have so many other things you could be doing?? Just baffles me. 

Another thing? Carrying around crates of Vinyl?? Bags of CDs with **ONE song on each..** flipping through them just to find the right track?? Why when you have hundred of Gigs of music on your computer at your disposal? 

Also... Why would a club owner or WHOEVER turn you down for using Controllers instead of CDJs? If they like your mix and think your good, bull-fucking-shit their not gonna let you play cause of that, it doesn't make sense. CDJs all the club has to offer?? Cool, buy a stand and put your controller over top of em. 

After my two weeks of research, I've come to conclusion that the only people that are bringing this down are the Elitists that have been doing it forever with their vinyls and CDJs crying 'SYNC faggot learn to beatmatch'. Utterly insane. After a week of preparing a playlist (filling out all my id3tags, key analysis, beatgridding) I've finally had a couple hours today to do some mixing and I've never had more fun.. and I felt like I've been doing it for a long time.

The future is now, get with the times or STFU about it. 

**The only reason why this strikes such a chord with me is because I had to deal with this shit before.. being an FL studio user and people saying (one of MANY examples) ""oh you use FL you should try ableton it's for pro's"".

And again, with a serious face, ""I can sing, give me the mic""

In the past year it has traveled about 35 thousand miles with me.  It's simple and a good starting point for anyone who wants to get going in DJing.  I believe its Mac only and requires [djay form the Mac AppStore](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/djay/id411699771?mt=12).  The controller is in decent condition.  I can post pix later if you like.  It was like $300 brand new, i'm willing to give it away free to a new comer as long as you cover shipping.  If you want throw in a few extra bucks I won't stop you :).

I have the original box also.  If no one is interested i'll probably try and sell it on craigslist, figured I could give back to the community though before doing the whole sale thing. It's USB powered meaning it will work in any country as it's not reliant on a external power supply, just your laptop!

Thanks guys!

edit: http://imgur.com/a/wQokU#0

**edit 2: I realize the title says free.  And that was my intention (other than shipping).  After so many messages, it's becoming harder and harder to sift the ones who need it vs. the ones looking to flip it on craigslist or whatever.  So to cover bases and make sure it goes to someone who needs it.  Lets start at $50 and that will include shipping in the US.  I'm NOT trying to start a bidding war.  But I really would feel like ass if it ended up on ebay or something.  Sorry to change the cards on you, again this was not my intention when I started this. But to be honest, when HPPD2 got down voted for saying ""Cool, just make sure whoever you give it to really needs it and doesnt already have any other gear and wont resell it"" it hit me the wrong way.  Thanks guys!**

Edit 3: Thanks everyone! This was fun, also pretty hard!  As of now *Daveaham_Lincoln* is getting it! Check out his post, and look for him soon in this reddit as he made a pretty slick deal !  Thanks to anonymous user for sending me reddit gold! That was awesome!  Glad to contribute to the community and thanks to everyone who was understanding about not receiving it, I hope in the future you get the gear you want.  Maybe in the future more people will donate old gear and we can have a gear swap or something!

Overall we think comments are pretty good here in /r/DJs, but the idea seems pretty neat so we decided to turn it on for the max length just to see what happens.

1363148004.0	1a733c	The Day I was Unprepared and, why I am abandoning Traktor.	the_bigwiggle	55	16	76	"About eight months ago, I decided to Start DJing again after close to 10 years.  In those 10 years technology advanced to amazing levels and I discovered that things like DVS, Controllers and Several types of DJ software.  I settled on Traktor Pro and two NDX900s.  I chose the NDX900s over a straight controller because I wanted to be able to play CDs if anything ever went wrong with my laptop during a gig.  I purchased a shit ton of music on digital format and backed up to CDs...for a while.  Soon, I began to think to myself *why am I bothering making these actual playable cd's when I can just transfer all this music to thumb drives, which my decks play*  The answer came over the weekend.  My computer crashed something awful leaving me unable to use Traktor.  No problem though, I had Thumb drives. What I never really thought of though was what it was like to navigate thumb drives with hundreds of songs on them.  It was a goddamn nightmare.

So, I said fuck it.  This never happened to me when I spun vinyl and cd's.  The worst thing I had to worry about was a cd skipping or, worse case scenario one of my decks goes down.  In which case, I always carried another CD player.  

Traktor is amazing but, it made me lazy.  Not Traktor's fault, it's mine.    But, it is what it is.  So, starting today, I am burning all my music into actual CD format and organizing it manually by Genre and Artist.  I'm going to play my next few gigs strictly old school without software.  I will go back to Traktor one day but I feel like I've been half assing it.

Not gonna lie. Gonna miss the sync button.  It makes things so simple but I'm fully capable without it.

&gt;Hi Doctor Nick,
A few months ago I opened for a pretty huge name on part of their European tour. It came about just because we were on the same agency at the time, and I thought it could be fun. I don't usually play the same type of music as this producer, but I realized I needed to at least incorporate some of this style into my set, as I was opening for HIS tour. I did this and the 4-5K strong crowd still booed me on the first night and threw all kinds of shit at me—no matter what I played, they only wanted the main act.

&gt;I stayed on and finished while pleading with the promoters to let me get off, as some pretty big things were getting thrown at me. I may have been a dodge-ball champion in high school, but I hadn't signed up for this and frankly was starting to fear for my safety.

&gt;Looking back, should I have just left and told the promoters to smarten up and put on the main act? Or was staying out there and doing the full 90 minutes they paid me for (even while pissing off the drug-fueled adolescent crowd) the right thing to do?

Here is Mille and Mr. Hirsch - Change
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YPUaD92dKY

There's a small, dutch Facebook group dedicated to finding the names of tracks that are still unknown. This track, featured in a recording of Seth Troxler on Ibiza, was one of the biggest mysteries yet. Months were spent looking for the name and artist of the track 'cause everybody agreed this track was far too good to stay under the radar. The search almost failed, 'cause after months of looking, pretty much everybody had given up on ever finding it, untill last week when one of the group members victoriously posted a soundcloud link to the actual song. It probably was one of the coolest moments in the groups existence, as you could just feel the euphoria of everyone being finally able to hear the track on it's own. 

The tune turned out to be 'Change' by berlin based artists Mille &amp; Mr. Hirsch. A duo unknown to us before we heard 'Change' but one we'll be keeping an eye on from now. Their label ApolloKrieg is based on an art collective from Berlin, from which they apparently draw a lot of inspiration. It must be a hell of a collective, if they manage to inspire them to create tunes of this beauty.

'Change' is an instant classic, such a beautiful chords progression combined with a steady groove and and sweet organ solo in the break will make it a track that will last for a long time. For now it has only seen a vinyl release, so we ripped it ourselves so that we could share it with you all :). What a great track to end your sunday (or any day) with!

Artist: Mille &amp; Mr. Hirsch

When I was in high school I mowed lawns and worked an after school job to fund my gear purchases. I saved for months to buy the cheapest direct drive turntable setup I could get my hands on. Numarks and a Vestax mixer. I thought I'd made it. Soon thousands would jump in unison to the rhythms that flowed through my fingertips. I ran them through a big bass amp -- with TUBES in it, for Christ's sake -- in my bedroom. And I practiced.

And I practiced.

And I practiced...

I had two vinyl copies of [Boogie Shoes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ux2WXNsqfe8) by K.C. and the Sunshine Band and I would loop them together, deck A to deck B and back again, for hours on end to practice my beat matching. I remember regularly tossing my Sennheiser's in frustration. I'd research tracks on the internet -- the internet in the Nineties that is, a morass of useless information with no [freshnewtracks.com](http://www.freshnewtracks.com) or [beatport.com](http://www.beatport.com) or even /r/djs -- and I'd mail order vinyl or scour the one store in my shitty deep south town that sold what I was looking for. I remember spending $8 or $10 for a single song. I'd put stickers on my records with the BPM and the key (after I'd figured it out by learning the chord progression on my guitar). To record a mix I'd have to borrow a friend's 4 channel multi-track recorder. It recorded to a cassette tape. I'd plug it in, hit record, do my mix and then record that cassette into my family's desktop so I could burn a CD. I played house parties, school events, that sort of thing but the thousands that I had pictured never jumped in unison. 

And then I graduated and went to college. I moved into a tiny dorm room where my setup wouldn't fit and I didn't touch my decks for years. They collected dust. One weekend when I was back from school visiting my family I gave them to a friend's younger brother when I heard he'd been pricing some. I figured it was better that he used them than I held onto them. And the dream died.

Fast forward ten years. 

Last week a business associate sent me [this video of Deadmau5](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SX2Gd-kqV5s) and the memories flooded back. I found this subreddit, I read through several squabbly posts and I quickly realized that most of you people have no fucking clue how good you've got it. Digital library management. Key lock. Looping built in to your software controller (as opposed to hooking my old Roland sampler in to my mixer). Effects without using guitar pedals. Websites DEDICATED to assisting DJs in building their libraries.

Today I went out and picked up a Numark Mixtrack Pro and recorded the [first mix I've attempted in over a decade](http://www.mixcloud.com/ProfessorMembrane/prowess/). It's solid, not brilliant but solid. But more importantly I was able to put it together in just a matter of hours with little practice. The barrier for entry has been lowered and that's not a bad thing. Quit squabbling about what's legitimate. Step up your game. The WHOLE POINT of all of this is the masterful manipulation of sound. How you do it makes no difference. I wish I was in high school again with these tools but I'm not. If you are keep your eye on what's important and WORK YOUR ASS OFF.

You can still make the thousands jump in unison."	t5_2rddy	True
1322041282.0	mmkth	Getting yourself known for beginner DJ's..	Miss-Solstice	37	5	41	"Being a DJ who has worked my way up over the years, I know how hard it can be. So I thought it would be cool for any of us with experience, be it lots of experience or little, in whatever genre or scene you're in, we could compile a list of helpful tips/things that upcoming DJ's could do to help themselves get booked. I've listed a few things I've applied over time, hope they can be of some help! 

* **Record a demo** - I'd advise any new DJ wanting to get booked to record a demo mix to hand out on a cd with your details on or send people online. 

* **Make a page for yourself** - Make a page where you can share your mixes. I know some people may feel its too soon to make a fan page and there are a lot of them around. If this is the case for you, set up a soundcloud account or something similar. Watching the amount of plays you gain each time you upload a mix is a nice way of keeping track of your progression. 

* **Network** - I've found this is one of the more important sides to getting yourself known. Sending a demo is sometimes not enough but get out there to events you're interested in playing at. Greet the promoter, talk about your interest in the night and have general chit chat. Promoters like to see your support for their events and they're more likely to remember you from face to face contact rather than a name on a mix, which they receive several of. 

* **Radio shows** - If you don't feel confident enough to have your own yet then find some friends who run one. Guest appearances on local or internet radio can help out a lot. I got one of my biggest gigs from playing on a smallish online radio station and a promoter enjoying what I played. You never know who is listening.. 

* **Don't give up** - If you love it, stick at it. As with everything in life, there will be highs and lows but just stick with it and the results will show in the long run.

I don't take anything due to my asthma, and drinking before my set would impair my performance, so instead I get to observe peoples moods changing, either going from a good night to a great night, or from a good night to an awful night.  I've gotten a lot of hugs from random strangers, but I've also been swung at because I had ""a look"" about me.  

You could still smoke in clubs which helped to calm people down and would actually negate the need for a smoke machine, lol.  When the smoking ban was introduced into Scotland, I found that a group of smokers would leave at the same time, have a couple of smokes outside and return, which was very annoying when the hot girls went out, the dancefloor would stop because no one wants to dance next to a sweaty ugly girl, so everyone would go to the bar til the hot girls came back!

People taking coke in the toilets, ewwwwww! I've seen DJs snorting coke behind the decks more times than I have fingers and toes, it just seems to be the thing that people have to do when they're clubbing.  Main thing about that I noticed was the energy in a room, it just seems to rise and rise, and some folk become VERY talkative, I could be in the middle of a mix and some dick just can't get it into his head that I'm busy for the next 30 seconds, and all he wanted to tell me was that he's going out for a minute, can I hold his coat, lmao!

I've seen ketamine just kill a dance floor, everyone up dancing until maybe 11, but then they get less energetic, some even sit down where they can, and the aforementioned bouncing club is now like a post wedding disco when both sides of the family hate each other!

E seemed to be the best drug, it's like everyone collectively forgetting about their problems or stigma and being free, I know that sounds like a bullshit cliché, but it's what I saw, people being friendly, helpful, very loving feeling, like at the end of Ghostbusters 2 when Ray gets slimed!

I have never used ""real"" decks (ex. CDJ's). I've been chatting with some local DJs and many of them seem to all believe that anyone who uses controllers and auto beat-matching is a tool and not a real DJ, and if I ever tried to use a controller in public I'd be laughed at. Does anyone else here feel the same way?

I'm hesitant to start using decks because 1) they're fucking expensive. 2) I'm used to using controllers in Ableton and Traktor and I am much more comfortable with them. 3) I can do a lot more effects and stuff to the music if I am using a controller and don't have to worry about beat matching. And decks don't have shit for effects (at least not the ones in my price range) like software does. 

I've also just considered using a Kontrol X1 along with decks so I can still use Traktor and not be a ""tool"" in the eyes of my peers. Anyone else do something like this?

I do understand that when DJing in clubs, it would suck being the only guy that needs special time to setup extra controllers and such when there are perfectly good decks sitting there. What do you guys think.... is digital DJing really all that frowned upon? "	t5_2rddy	True

I have known him since before he started DJing. He always seemed like a decent guy. He was interested in stage design, visual presentations, etc. He started playing and was able to get a few gigs, even though I'm my opinion, his mixing is pretty bad. He has a lot of energy and is good at promoting himself. By that I mean he spams Facebook groups and events with his mixes even if he's not playing.

So now he's moved away, and he posted a big ""Fuck You"" to my city, the local DJs and the scene here. It caught a lot of us by surprise because he was always welcomed into our relatively small tight scent. We booked him, had him do visuals, etc. Now of course everyone here thinks he's a scumbag. I think he will find that moving to a bigger city means that it will be harder to get booked, not easier.

Anyway, I had my first gig at a party at my frat last night, and there was actually a decent amount of people (~75+ people). Everything went about as well as you can hope for your first gig to go. No major mistakes, but a few things did go wrong. First mistake came when i was cueing another track and i didn't realize i had the volume on its channel up for about 30 seconds of cueing and going back... oops! Second mistake was when i got distracted and let the song play out because i had to yell at some drunk girl to get away after literally throwing a temper tantrum because i wouldn't play her 60 bpm rap song when everyone was dancing to electro. Last mistake was some drunk girl accidentally unplugging the power strip which cut all the music.

Overall though, it went very well. Nothing is better than having an awesome transition and just hearing everyone go ""OHHH!"" Everyone was coming up to me after saying that i killed it and they loved my set.

They loved it from beginning to end. However, the girls hated me. It didn't stop them from constantly touching my shit, but they hated my guts. This is what caused all the trouble. I figured ""Oh, sorority girls. Top 40 time."" I'd been practicing mixing and mashing and transitions for weeks, preparing for this moment and two songs in I get bitched at by one of them. She wants house music, so I put on some house music which she then bitches about. Then more girls start bitching about how they want different house music. Then the other girls want the Top 40 back. This then pisses the other girls off and so on and so forth. This continued for HOURS. I was told by one of the brothers to just tell them to fuck off, but I'm too nice of a guy to do that. I tried explaining to them, all while trying to make these on the spot ""transitions,"" that there are dozens of people making requests and that I'd get to theirs as soon as I could, but they got angry at me for that. The worst was when I played a remix of My Life Would Suck Without You. In the 3 or 4 years that this song has been out, I've never NOT seen some white girls lose their shit to it. Tonight I had 5 of them and 5 frat bros charge the booth ready for blood. I made notes of what songs were requested so I could get them and hope for the best next time, because I'm not gonna give up over one bad night.

So overall, I'm not giving up. The frat boys loved me and I'm pretty sure they're gonna want me back. If not, whatever, tough luck. Next time I get a gig I'm setting up some kind of barricade to keep sorority sluts from blitzing the booth with requests; folding chairs, tables, idk I'll figure something out. This night has made me lose a lot of faith in humanity... but I can't let that slow me down. I still wanna keep going. Things are taking off for me and I can't let one night stop that.

TL;DR: Among other things, the most important part of this post is that sorority girls fucking suck and I hope they die. I legitimately hope they get hit by cars walking home from the bars tonight.

**EDIT:** Thanks for the support guys. The fact that what happened tonight was normal makes me feel much better about it. 

**DOUBLE EDIT C-C-C-COMBO:** I was pretty damn angry when I wrote this post. Obviously I went a bit overboard with my comments on the sorority girls and I'm sorry to those who were offended."	t5_2rddy	True

Why not have both?  **It's perfectly OK to charge money to do something you love.** 

DJing is expensive.  My equipment costs a lot of money. I have at least $20k worth of DJ equipment and music.  I need a vehicle to cart it around it.  I need insurance to cover it all.  I need a website to attract business.  I need to advertise.  I need to buy music. I need to spend TIME getting that music.  In short, this is an expensive hobby that CAN pay well.  


I know when you are first starting out, that DJing is it's own form of payment.  Playing in front of SOME people is better than playing in front of NO people.  Promoters know this and will let you donate yourself, your time.  Giving it away once means you'll be giving it away many times.  Most young dj's don't have 2 nickels to rub togther, why would you give it away?  Chances are you're doing a lot of promotion to bring people to see you.  You're maybe even providing sound equipment, and lets not forget about your time and talent.  These are all worth money.

There's no such thing as a sell out.  I used to think that DJ's that started in the underground who ended up making it big with a commercial track were ""selling out"".  I don't think making money is selling out. Actually, isn't that the whole point?  To make it big?  To put your music or style in front of a whole lot of people to make them happy?  To not have to work for some JO 5 days a week and then go DJ at some little club for free?   You're telling me you would rather DJ on your busted Behringer mixer than DJ in front of 3000 people to the tune of $6K? 

People will actually take you more seriously if you ask them for money.  If you aren't charging anything, or charging a lot less than most, then people will wonder why.   Don't be afraid to raise your rates.  I recently raised mine, and quoted the price to a prospective client and they were happy to pay it.  Just make sure you deliver what you promise!  

I DJ full time, meaning that I RARELY use an alarm clock to get me up no matter what day it is. I bring home between 600 and 2600 a week. I spend my weekdays working on my own graphic design work and website, browsing reddit and facebook, and listening to whatever the hell I want, from Pleasurehead to Pantera. I can get up whenever I want from my computer and play with my animal friends, or take a break and rip it on the Xbox or go golfing.   Not really bragging as much as I am saying ""Charge them bastards!""

Also, stay away from these ""DJ competitions"".  I know you're excited, but this is really just the club owners/promoters new method of NOT paying DJ's.  I even saw one club have 4-5 dj's per week on their lineup, and whomever brought the most people on their competition night got to actually PLAY.  The other DJ's didn't get to play at all.  It was total and complete bullshit, yet, DJ's were lining up around the block to sign up.  The prize was 4 ""paid"" timeslots.  Are you kidding me?  If you see one of these scams, STOP GOING TO THAT VENUE ALTOGETHER.

**EDIT** If it's a legit contest, with real prizes, then by all means enter.  DJ competitions that measure ONLY by how many people DJ's bring and offer prizes such as a shitty residency are SCAMS.


I'm not saying ""DJ gigs you will hate"".  Personally, I don't care for school gigs.  Kids listen to crap, IMO, and I always gotta worry if I am playing something that might offend one of their parents.   I prefer playing for a crowd that appreciates real EDM (house, trance, electro) or adults...but I can DO it if I need to... for $600.00/4 hrs.

1372191014.0	1h25sr	Why you should do a top40 DJ gig.	subjectivve	41	9	42	"I feel there is not enough good content in r/DJs. Beginners are asking for help, and many of the people commenting give bad, unpractical advice about making contracts, calling lawyers, and circle jerking about playing Levels by Avicii.

I've commented in the past about doing top40 gigs, much to the derision of people online. Supposedly I'm a sucker for having a well-paying top40 remix (commercial house) residency several times a month, alongside the underground gigs I actually *want* to do. And I'm just getting started.

If you're already a hobby DJ spinning dance music, you have everything you need-- all that changes is your format. So if you're tired of people not responding to your emails about your unique chilltrap style, you may want to consider DJing top40 music. Here are some reasons why. All the following advice comes from personal experience, meaning I did all the dumb shit I tell you not to do. (By the way, this advice is for beginning nightclub DJs-- weddings are a whole other story.)

**You learn how to contact clubs.**
To get a gig, you'll have to go speak with people who want to make money and may not be interested in what you're about at all. This is good practice negotiating and communicating about business. People will absolutely tell you no, so on to the next one.

Forget about email-- it's only for confirming details AFTER you've spoken with or met someone.

You want to either call directly on the phone, or better yet, go to the club and speak to them in person. You just simply need to ask who's the bar owner, or in charge of music and DJs. Shake their hand and sell yourself to them. Be forward! Tell them you're a DJ, what kind of music you play, and where you've spun before. You're saying to their face (in not so many words)-- ""I want to DJ at your club. What are you going to do about it?"" 

You want to ask first ""Are you looking for DJs?"", as they may already have a night in mind to fit you into. If they're not, you may unfortunately have to ask what the arrangement is for you to rent the room. Sometimes they'll ask for a certain amount of drink sales or ask you to pay a fee straight up. You'll get a feel for which clubs have regular crowds/foot traffic, and which ones you'll have to work to get people out to.

Unless you're a wedding DJ, or spinning for big cash, DON'T make anyone sign a contract or threaten a lawyer or some silly bullshit. Make a verbal agreement, shake hands, and write it out in an email afterwords to make sure everything is clear. If a promoter promises $100, and doesn't pay up, just move on and never work with them again.

**Practice.**
All DJing is good practice. With top40 you'll be beatmatching, blending, cutting and transitioning between different styles and BPMs. If you're playing radio edits, you may be doing 4-bar mixes instead of 64. 

You'll learn how songs from different styles and eras relate to each other in ways the crowd never imagined, and how to play similar songs in groups of 3-5. You'll learn how to program music as a night progresses, and how to read when the crowd is ready to dance, or when you should clear the floor and start fresh.

You'll figure out your best hardware/software setup and how to streamline the way you spin. And more practically, you'll get the feel of standing in the booth until 3-4am and making this work with your day job. 

**You learn how to get music and how music promo works.**
You find it's a lot harder to get pop music than you think. How do I get these radio edits? Do I buy them individually from iTunes? How do I get these promo-only dance remixes? It used to be so easy to torrent the Beatport top100! Help!

Likely you'll have to join a digital record pool, preferably one that is legal. For older music, you may have to look to PromoOnly or ERG for their popular music collections.

Plus you'll build a music library of popular songs for those key moments when someone asks you to do an impromptu 80s cheese or 90s euro set. Unlike throwaway dance music tools of now, I guarantee this collection will come in handy someday down the road. Buy an extra hard drive.

And finally if you're a real DJ, you should know that just because music is popular, doesn't mean it's bad. There's lots of excellent, accessible music you can insert in your sets that shows your unique style and taste.

**And finally.... MONEY!**
Unlike the electro house night you tried to throw, that you paid out of pocket for, and no one showed up... top40 clubs are full of people, who buy alcohol, so that means the club pays you money! A top40 DJ will never run out of work. 

Except in special circumstances, don't do any gigs for free. For people starting out, ask for $100-$150 for the night. Highball the price and work your way down. If the gig is in a bar, you may get drink tickets! Remember to tip.

There is so much more involved to this than what I've listed here, but good luck. Work hard, be persistent, grind it out. At the end you'll be richer and a better DJ."	t5_2rddy	True

Veteran DJs - what are some of the things you had wished you had done earlier or differently in your career?	dj_soo	34	6	46	"This is mainly a question to the more experienced guys out there - maybe 5+ years of experience, which will hopefully help some of the newer DJs that make up this sub.

What are some of the things you wish you had done differently?

Some of mine:


*DJ Name:  I split my DJ time between underground gigs or festivals - where I'm building up a decent little following dj and production-wise - and mainstream top 40/corporate/mobile gigs which I do for the money (I consider the mainstream work my day job right now).   I really wish I had decided to use a different name for my mainstream gigs as I tend to get pigeon-holed a little (at least locally) in terms of my style.  I'm in the unfortunate position of sometimes losing out on underground gigs (the ones I love) due to having a reputation of playing mainstream shows around town.


*Production:  I started getting into production maybe 5 years ago and had my first tune signed about 3 years ago.  I'm still having trouble getting myself to really push at it cause honestly, I just love DJing more than producing tunes (although I still like doing production).  When I started, you could still have a viable career building up a national and international following off purely DJing and DJing skill.  That's all changed now and production is pretty essential in order to break past the local level in terms of gigs.  Really wish I had started sooner in my life especially now that there's so much competition.


*Mic work:  Yea, yea.  Most of us hate MCs.  They're either talking too much over your tracks, too loud, throwing down too many cliche's, or just plain annoying.  That said, a good MC can really add to a live set even if it's just doing hype work.  Being good at MCing during your sets can really hype a crowd when done well, but more importantly, really helps build your brand.  You're letting the crowd know who you are (hopefully not to the point of annoyance), and that goes a long way in maintaining your name and brand and most importantly: building fans.  I only started getting on the mic in the last couple of years or so and it really is a skill you have to work at... granted a couple drinks doesn't hurt...


*Pro-activeness:  There was a time when I was getting a ton of bookings based mainly on reputation.  It was great having people constantly hitting you up for gigs.  Granted this was also when I was working a day job so I could pick and choose gigs as I wanted.  After a while, you kind of take it for granted which is not a good thing.  When certain markets started dipping off for me, for the longest time, I just didn't bother trying to pursue it again cause it was just so demoralizing hearing ""not interested"" or worse, just getting no responses.  I'm much more aggressive in pursuing bookings now and I'm much less phased by rejection.  Think of it like asking someone out.  You may get rejected or ignored 9/10 times, but you'll never get that yes if you don't keep asking...

Here is how things usually go:

1 active drive: your collection is already gone

n active drives: a power problem could kill them all

n active, 1 offline: if you verified the backup you are probably ok as long as the backup isn't compromised.

n active, n offline verified and in various locations: drive failure, power surge, theft, human error, sabotage, building fire/disaster, zombie apocalypse, and you should still be fine

To be safe this is what you should do:

Step1: build your music collection

Step2: copy your collection onto as many different devices and formats as necessary (disc, flash, optic disc, cloud, tape)

Step3: Verify your backups on multiple machines, failure to check means you didn't actually backup anything

Step4: Distribute your physical backups to various locations (home, work, friends, parents, bank, storage) this is less practiced but you put all your efforts at risk in the event of a serious accident/disaster.

Step5: Update and re-verify your backups regularly.

Step6: Laugh when you suffer a drive failure because its pretty much impossible to lose information at this point

My PC contains my master copy on 2 internal drives, 1 SSD and one HDD, those are duplicated on to 2 external HDDs that are not regularly plugged in, 1 of which sits in my basement. I used the second external to duplicate my collection onto my macbook and my girlfriends computer as well. And all of that doesn't count the multiple flash drive copies I use in my CDJs for day to day playback.

that's between 6 and 10 copies at ay given time and I would consider that pretty close to the minimum I'm comfortable with. It's a pain to keep them all organized but that's a better problem than trying to recover lost data

Reasons: I played violin for eight years of my life, then bass guitar for seven, and am now DJing and from my experience in all three I can tell you, if you're a beginner, you just don't know what you want. Here's my favorite example of just go with it and learn, as told by a tale of three basses.

~

1.) When I was first getting into bass playing, I bought a bright red bass guitar. Standard body shape, nothing special, cheap, with a lame ""police line, do not cross"" strap and a matching red cord.

This is most people's initial instinct when buying something, you lack skills, get something that looks totally fly, and I thought that bass would be perfect for my little alt. rock band my buddy started.

This bass was perfect for my needs at the time, because it made noise. That's all I needed, a fairly acceptable noise maker. Then as I kept playing I learned shortcomings of that bass in-line with my style. I plucked the bass with my fingers, not a pick, and this bass was more pick inclined.

I preferred booming low end bass and the pick ups here weren't very good, so it didn't compliment my style, and I ended up deciding it was too flashy.

~

2.) My second bass I bought from a friend of a friend for what I'm pretty sure was an attempt for drug money. It was a black bass, had giant humbucker pick-ups, was easier to pluck, and had an active drive. The bass was amazing and I thought I had landed on my dream bass guitar.

It wasn't flashy, I could show off my natural skills on it, and I thought I was going to destroy with this bass. As I got better though I realized that an active drive bass pushes the bass too hard through the amp and caused distortion, and as my skills improved and my tone became more important, my low end mattered less and an overall good sound was more important.

That and I realized I didn't like the look of my bass, it was too heavy metal, I wanted something quirky to match the band I was in.

~

3.) Bass 3, I had learned that I needed loose strings, a passive bass(and something I didn't even know existed when purchasing bass 1 or 2), something that I liked the look of, and a bass that had a clean, but solid low end. I found it, I bought it, and loved the bass every gig after that.

~

Beginners: buy something you like, you have NO IDEA what type of mixer, turntables, cdjs, controller, brand, software/no software you want. Just get something inexpensive, make sure you like spinning and can enjoy it and have fun learning what your style is and as you learn you'll start realizing what products best fit it.

This is something you wade into, making small purchases here and there, not something you dive into and drop 2k on because you want to ""try it out."" Get a cheap $300 controller, sit at your computer with headphones on and just see what you like. If you love it, great, if you don't? friend or pawn shop. Don't overspend and don't freak out about it, just get SOMETHING and learn by doing. That's the best way to figure out what music you like and what to get to facilitate that the best.

tl;dr just buy something cheap, you'll learn what's best for you over time.

~


Edit: Just to be clear, this is mostly for people like me when I started DJing. When I started I was just on my laptop and had to scrounge cash together to save up and spend $300 on a controller. Basically vinyl/CDJs weren't even an option, and I think most people are in the same position. Was I starting off trying to play gigs? No way, I was practicing so I wouldn't embarrass myself whenever I upgraded, and eventually did. 

Even when I upgraded though I couldn't afford CDJs. If I could afford them I would buy them, but I can't. Traktor S4 is the highest I can go, so I did. Keep that in mind when giving people a hard time for sync buttons and how I should buy CDJs when I in fact can't afford them.

The thing they all share in common is that they are all silver/black over-ear headphones. 

I always noticed that whenever a ""what headphones should I buy"" thread pops up on this sub-reddit the first answer is almost always Sennheiser HD-25s. Personally, I have always been turned off by them due to the lack of swivels and because on-ear headphones have never been comfortable thanks to my piercings.

That said, yesterday spurred on by you guys I bought a pair just to see what they were like. I used them for my gig last night with my HDJ-1000s in my bag just in case. The verdict? I am a convert! The were so comfortable and the sound was amazing. I have never heard so clearly and for the first time in ages I woke up the morning after a gig without any ringing or pain in my ears.

For ages I have recommended various on-ear headphones but from now on I will be recommending the HD-25s. My Pioneer's have been downgraded to backup headphones."	t5_2rddy	True

I'm playing at a bar, asked by the owners to bring in a ""younger hipper crowd"" and that they want house music.  We work out that we'll do every Thursday on a 3 month trial where I get a bar tab but no pay.  After 3 months we'll figure out a good payment based on performance.  I've done 2 shows now, first night 300% of typical sales, last week 500% and when I turned on the lights at 1:30 the place had 40 people where 5 usually sit.  Everyone really enjoyed the music and for the most part the night went well.  
Here's where it got weird: About 10:30 this older guy ( early 60’s) comes up and says "" hey I'm a sound engineer, I'm telling you the bass is too high""  so I walk out and sure enough I had the sub turned up too much.  I thank him and he asks me ""can you do me a favor and play some older tracks?"" I reply “Sure, but it's all remixes"".  He thanks me and sits back down.  
I play a Fleetwood mac remix, a G&amp;R remix, etc. And 30 minutes go by.  He comes back up and says “HEY, I thought you were going to play some older stuff, this crowd doesn't like your music...""   I tell him that I did play some remixed versions of 70's and 80's tracks and that all I have is dance music.  He grumbles a little and I tell him that if he doesn't like the genre the owners booked, he should take it up with them as they're sitting at the bar but that I have no music that isn't dance music.
Another 30 minutes goes by and he comes back.  This time he's fairly irate.  He waited till my wife was in the bathroom and comes up and tells me “I don't think you understand what's happening here.  This used to be a biker bar and no one here wants your shitty music.  Does it look like anyone is enjoying your music? “I reiterate that if he has a problem with the booking that he should take it up with the owner, not with me but that I was asked to play what I'm playing.  His response: “I have a weapon, do you want to see it?  Play one more techno track and you'll get to see it"".  We exchange a few choice words and then luckily my wife came and turned on the charm and bought him a drink and diffused the situation.   Shook me up quite a bit and took a couple glasses of scotch to calm my nerves. 
How would you deal with this type of situation, and anyone that's dealt with it in the past, did it end badly?  I've (obviously) dealt with lots of drunk idiots a lot but never had openly hostile people like that.

TLDR: Got threatened based on music I was asked to play, how do you handle that kind of situation?

The thing is, I'm not a lawyer, and although I haven't had problems, I'm concerned at how well my contract would hold up in a legal dispute (if it escalated to that point).

So I know that in general, one is always supposed to have a contract, but I've seen in practice when some of my working DJ friends maintain their residencies purely as verbal agreements.

So I want to ask the professionals here: What do you guys put into your contract? Did you guys get your contracts checked out by a lawyer or where they handed down so to speak? Are there some instances where it's more socially appropriate to forego the contract or is it all the time every time?

I'm really curious to see the mix of responses the subscribers here would have. I feel like ""Should I have a contract"" might be a r/beatmatch question, but specifically the content and when and where to enforce them would be an intermediate level question."	t5_2rddy	True

I just wanted to pop by and inform the /r/dj community that they've helped another novice into... well, a slightly more credible novice.

I live in San Jose, California, and I've been attending this particular party for a few years now.  This city has never really been well known for electronic music in the past.  But this party is known as basically the only place that plays indie/electro/dance music exclusively for the last several years.

I've been honing my skills for the last year and a half, playing a few house parties. And also recording and posting a few mixes, which eventually made their way through the grapevine to the promoters of this particular event who I casually know by being a regular at said event.
A couple months ago one of the promoters approached me and said they really enjoyed one of the mixes and also asked if I would be interested in playing an opening set some time.  Naturally, I agreed, but nothing was really set in stone.

Fast forward to this week.  Coming off the heels of a very successful night at the last party, I was formally asked to open the February party.  As a nice additional compliment I was told I was hired specifically to continue the momentum built from last month.


Sorry for the wall of text, but I'm very excited.
Anyway, Thanks again everyone for all the useful threads that have helped me suck less and less.

&gt; A. Retarded the creation of a robust DJ/Remix industry:

&gt;Many other countries have a robust culture of DJ’s and remixing, but the United States, quite perplexingly as the creator of a large portion of the world’s content, is far behind.
&gt;
&gt;DJ/remix culture is a democratizing system where self-starters can compete based upon merit. In other countries, every 16-year-old with a computer and “Virtual DJ” software can remix various songs and compete based upon talent. As a result there are thriving DJ/remix markets in Turkey and other countries. These DJ’s put their content online or sell mix-tapes (no longer tapes) and there is a meritocratic system that continues to innovate. 
&gt;
&gt;However, in the United States this culture is heavily retarded.
&gt;
&gt;DJ’s in the United States are mainly live performers, as there are heavy restrictions on what they are allowed to release and sell as mix-tapes. There are convoluted rules are on what parts of songs that they can sample, often requiring input from lawyers to avoid massive fines or lawsuits. As a result, in the United States there are great live performer DJ’s, but selling most “real” mix-tapes by small level DJ’s is illegal and disincentivized. This stifles most forms of mash-ups or selling of remixed songs by independent artists. This does not completely eliminate the remix market. While the producing artists themselves can remix their own songs, and major DJ’s or other artists can remix other people’s songs and pay high level royalties in the $100,000’s-per-song range.
&gt;
&gt;However, this prohibitively high price range stifles most average DJ’s from legally releasing their own mash-up or remixed songs. While there is an underground remix black market, this market is nothing like it would be if this were legalized.
&gt;
&gt;Since these prospective new remixes would not replace the original songs, but merely supplement them and perhaps even increase sales of the original songs, overall productivity is greatly hampered by making production of these materials effectively illegal.

I just found it interesting that part of the culture had made its way into the copyright argument in congress. "	t5_2rddy	True

I built a huge dance party there from scratch, went from having a couple of friends out to support me to an over-capacity crowd with more broken glass, fights, fondling, sweat and bad electro than you can shake a stick at.  
Sadly, all thing must come to an end.  The scene in our town has changed a bit, the kids a little less ready to accept different styles of music (all anybody wanted last year was hard electro and dubstep, I was sort of over that by then).  I had some amazing times, and I made lots of people happy.
When the bar closed I tried up at another place but it's kind of a skiddy bar and all the staff wanted me to do was stick to mainstream dance.  And I sort of realized that I was too tired to fight for a new crowd again, too tired to hash it out every week.  So I decided to shut it down.  
I still love to spin and I'll miss bringing new music ti different people and making them dance.  I'll probably still play here and there but by-and-large I've retired from the weekly club grind.

I first took it as a joke, and started playing a bit more children music, when she comes again and tells me she's going to fire me on the spot for not playing ONLY kid music, a bit scared I started to mix only kid music, I bored myself and got bad reviews from other people.
I was 16 at the time, and even today I woudn't know what to do if that would happen again, I still do kid parties and never experienced this anymore.

So I've been DJing for a little over two years, mostly at college frat/house parties and student events, and I've found that several aspects of the song request process are a drag. So I decided to try and make it less awful.

My friend and I are in the early stages of developing a web app that lets you receive and manage song requests over twitter and SMS. It'll let you keep track of requests you receive, reply to them, mark them as played, and gracefully ignore annoying requesters/requests. 

To make sure we're including the features that are actually useful to you guys, we've written up a quick 10-question [survey](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/HJMFT9J) to see what we should focus on. In exchange, you guys will be first in line to receive invites to the beta when it's ready!

If you have any questions, feel free to ask me in the comments or in a PM! Thanks so much!"	t5_2rddy	True

1357108960.0	15tbjn	Don't Be Afraid to Check a Promoter on Bullshit: An Anecdote for Djs New to Playing Out	uzisdolan	37	7	31	"Hey guys/gals. Had an interesting experience last night and kind of just wanted to share in case anyone with a lil less experience finds themselves in a similar situation. Those of you who are already familiar with promoters BS and ways to deal with it can probably relate or add something. 

My partner and I were asked by a reputable local hip hop producer to play at his NYE kegger in a loft space converted from an old schoolhouse. Sounds pretty cool right? Long story short, when we show up, we're informed there's a $20 cover and we have no guestlist. That's strike one right there. We had agreed to play a set for free (not complaining, jus sayin) and help promote it, that's always ground for at LEAST a small guestlist. I don't care what they spent on kegs or flyers or sounds, if you want us to show up with our thousands of dollars worth of equipment and play an hour for free, you're gonna have to give a little up.

The last straw though was when this promoter/producer/dj guy's manager (aka his DAD) told us the two lovely young ladies accompanying us who arrived with us, provided transportation, and carried a dj bag or two, would have to each pay the $20 cover charge. It was at that point I politely told the old man we would not be performing that night. He (laughably) tried to justify the expense but hearing the bullshit that was being flung from his mouth was too much and we immediately booked it outta there. Lucky for us it was NYE eve and parties were going on everywhere, and within 5 mins of announcing via twitter we weren't performing, we had an invitation to play a house party. 

The night turned out great, we all had fun, and no one had to bend under BS demands of the promoter.  If you're just starting to get out, there will be tons of situations where you're not happy with the conditions of the party.  Some times its important to grit your teeth and bear it.  A lot of what we do as Djs is based on the connections and relationships we can make. In the beginning it can be more difficult to judge what's worth it. This producer is certainly well known with a decent demographic in our city, and considering our new dj/production duo is only about 4 months old, the potential to showcase our music to the right people was there.  Lucky for us our previous projects and years of hitting the pavement and making connections puts us in a comfortable enough position to say, 'Lol fuck that' and not have to worry about did we burn an important bridge. 

So for all of you talented bedroom djs ready to take the next step and go public, go for it, just be prepared to play some crappy shows.  Its called paying dues and we've all gotta do it, just make sure you're in touch with the difference between paying dues and shitty people. There's certainly a grey area, and I normally err on the side of caution because typically even a shitty show that you don't get payed for and no one shows up to is still an hour of practice and some potential networking. But lol if you think I'm paying for my girl to get into a party I'm spinning. Don't be afraid to tell these promoters to go fuck themselves, they're a dime a dozen no matter what their hype says. (but so are we, so don't get too cocky. Also, none of this applies if your under contract to perform, but if your just getting into live spinning thats probably not an issue)."	t5_2rddy	True

I'm an open-format producer turned DJ and have been DJing (Serato + Turntables) in clubs/bars for about four years now. Because I come from the production side of things, I have made thousands of edits/custom mash-ups/etc. I would like to start giving them away for free for other DJ's, but I'm trying to think of a good way to do this. I would like to use it to help new DJs, but also for the (selfish) reason for exposure to help me book more (recently moved to NYC- I have the talent, but not the connections). So, DJs of Reddit, how would YOU guys like to get these? I'm debating a mailing list, or setting up my own (free) ""mini"" record pool on a website, but would love any input. Thanks!


EDIT: Thanks for all the ideas. I'm going to look into a private record pool. The part I was worried about with soundcloud was by putting all these edits through there, my original tracks would get hidden/lost by constant stream of edits.

In that year we have become a regular community of music loving, vinyl scratching, jesus posing freaks of nature. To commemorate this historic landmark, we'd like to put on a streaming event. I've been talking about this in the channel for some time now, and many of us are interested. Since most of us are in different time zones, so timing will be tricky, but I'm sure we can figure something out. If you're interested in meeting the IRC /r/djs crazies, please stop by with either [The Freenode Webchat](http://webchat.freenode.net/) or your favorite IRC client. You will need to specify the #r_djs room and a nickname if connecting with the web chat. I would like to get a live streaming event on or around Nov 28th, 2012. You can download an IRC client for your OS here:

* [Hexchat Windows IRC Client](http://www.hexchat.org/home/downloads)
* [Colloquy Mac OSX Client](http://colloquy.info/downloads.html)
* If you're using Linux, you should know how to run/install XChat/irssi/bitchx

In Hexchat, open the network browser, find Freenode and connect. Then type /join #r_djs to join in on the fun. Colloquy should be similar, but I wouldn't know. 

We have built a really wonderful community of producers, DJs and music lovers from all around the globe. If you're interested in both craziness and in-depth discussion, please stop on by. IRC is an interesting medium, if you're unfamiliar with how it works, you can check out a short [IRC Primer](http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/ircprimer.html) on IRChelp.org. There are many commands to learn, but all you really need to do is chat. If upon joining the chat room, you don't immediately get a response, please stick around and idle for a while, someone will greet you. 

We're looking forward to another amazing year!

Super easy to make. The only things I'd warn anyone wanting to build one is the positioning of the lights. Attach the lights last so the laptop stand screws don't get in the way. Hold the lights in position before attaching to see how you like them. I found the further back you position them, the better glow it casts. Closer to the front doesn't look nearly as nice. Also...the bolts for fastening the CAPITA brackets to the rest are jusssst long enough to clear the thickness of the EXPEDIT bookshelf.

He then secures a night, brings in some equipment and ""performs"" at certain places, then people realize he is full of utter shit (he is obsessed with beat matching...even bringing a 96bpm to a 120bpm) he doesn't watch the volume or EQ - often new songs will come in blasting or whispering confusing the people.  He only plays dubstep soundcloud/youtube amateur mashups and speeds them up horribly to the sound of chipmunks.  When somebody requests a song, he will go on youtube and type *whatever song DUBSTEP MIX* and just download off youtube and play it........even if it is 128kbps....

I think you get the point!

Now I wouldn't actually care how bad he was, he's been ran out of every dj gig in the city but he constantly comes in to my venues and all he does is how horrible I am.  He will go to new potential employers and begin to talk that I steal other peoples sets and just do pre-played (which is a horrible fabricated lie) and that i am overpriced.  
Another particular thing about him is how he has this horrible habit of  being a compulsive liar about EVERYTHING HE SAYS.  He swears up and down he's co produced with Benny Benassi and even opened for him (when there is no evidence)  - he even slept with a local radio rep and when they were done threatened to slander the radio rep if he didn't have his sets played during rush hour (he doesn't realize radio stations don't really often chose what they play).

Maybe I am being petty but this guy seriously bugs the fuck out of me.

Do you guys have any DJ fraud stories? How did you deal with it in the situation? Any tips besides ignore this dude?

1338185359.0	u8d0h	How to find a fuck-ton of good music		34	6	31	"* Create an account on beatport.com, trackitdown.net and other good music catalog sites
* Pick a song/album that you enjoy
* Note the label that the song/album was released on (artists often have more than one sound, and release different sounds on different labels)
* Scour the label for good shit
* Repeat steps 2-5 until your collection is uber

Often labels hone in on specific sounds - even moreso than artists. You'll find mammoth labels like Spinnin Records that obviously do everything, but when you get to the smaller records, you'll start to notice that if you stick by labels rather than artists, finding the sounds you're looking for will be much easier."	t5_2rddy	True

The profiles are easily identifyable as they are very different from my usual crowd. All of them have obvious stock photos, they all have double names and often photos of the opposite gender. 

How does this happen and why? It doesn't seem the usual ""follow me back"" spam attack.

He then just adds, modifies and/or removes loops or Ableton how and when he wants and paints at every performance another musical journey.

For me one of the best out there in terms of technical mastership. And someone who is really a true performer, just like a jazz master would improvise his music at every gig. Or simply an animal as Chris Liebing once said.

**Vinyls**

The words ""vinyls"" does not exist. The plural of vinyl is vinyl or ""vinyl records"". 

- Bob has a large vinyl collection.
- Bob plays vinyl.
- Bob is going to the store to grab some vinyl.
- Bob plays vinyl on his turntables.
- Bob has one vinyl record.
- Bob has ten vinyl records.
- Bob got some new vinyl.

**Platter** - When talking about CDJs or controllers.

CDJs and controllers do not have platters, they have jog wheels. On a vinyl turntable it is called the platter because you place the record on it much in the way you would place food on a serving platter. 

- The platter on a turntable usually spins at 33 RPM.
- You use the jog wheel on a CDJ to pitch bend or scratch.

**Electro vs electro**

Usually when people say electro these days what they mean is Electro House which is confusing for old fogies like myself because Electro is actually its own genre originally called ""Electro Funk"". If you're talking Electro House and shortening it to electro do not capitalize the e.

**Techno**

This is nothing new, some people have been calling all forms of electronic music ""techno"" for as long as I can remember and longer. The problem is, some of us actually play a genre called Techno which came originally from Detroit in the 80s. 

Techno like House also has sub-genres; Minimal, Tribal, Funky, Acid, and so on. It's best when dealing with other DJs not to use Techno as a descriptor for electronic music lest you confuse someone who thinks you're talking about the genre.

1351362986.0	126l3w	What's a polite way to tell a fellow DJ he needs to work on his craft?	sorry_bro_you_suck	44	15	54	"**Unnecessary Backstory**

Last night, I was supposed to share DJing duties with a good friend, he is fairly new to DJing (a bit over a year of bedroom DJing).  It was a pretty ghetto setup, and neither of us have that much equipment, but I digress.  He went to our party with a predetermined setlist of electrohouse and dubstep.  The crowd wasn't into it at all, but he didn't adapt to this, and just played out his setlist straight.

I played a warmup set and got up to some midtempo hip hop at 90 bpm before switching off to him with a full room of people tapping toes and grooving to the chill beat.  His first song was an electrohouse (the kind with a huge drop bro) remix of Thriller, which emptied the room.

He stuck to his premade setlist even though it was literally just him alone in the room DJing while everyone else was sitting outside, with the doors and windows closed to get away from the music.  Eventually he reached a point in his set where he played Gangnam Style, which got a decent amount of people back into the house to dance, but he followed that with Bass Cannon so everyone left again.  Eventually, with an hour before the host planned to kick us out, he gave music control back to me.

I didn't play music for half an hour to coax people back inside (they were all cold be then and readily came back in now that the music was off).  I started creeping in music, and eventually built to playing the Time Warp from Rocky Horror, which got people doing that line dance.  By that time, though, everyone was leaving.

I feel that his rigid set severely detracted from the night.  It was a costume party and he had several opportunities to play popular music highlighting various costumes (Beatlejuice, Michael Myers could each have had their soundtrack played, or one of the thousand remixes of them).  He played uncomfortably loud and didn't account for our shitty speaker setup being biased towards the high end (making dubstep sound even worse).  His song choice made people flee the warmth of the house to sit out in the October cold, which he didn't see as a sign to change up his music.

**Necessary reading**

I realize I'm just bitching at this point, but I feel he could have vastly improved upon his set through several easy changes.  He was playing through Traktor so it wasn't like he was limited by what he brought with him.  He ignored requests and killed the energy by the time I was supposed to take over, which happened two hours late.  His song choice had no flow and often mixed (noticeably) out of key.

The point of this overly ranty post is that I really want to help him, but I'm afraid if I approach him on this he'll see it as me being upset that I didn't get to play.  I don't know any way to approach him and say that his set sucked.  He was very proud of it because he played the tracks that he liked and beatmatched it manually (with visual cues from Traktor).  I don't want to be douche-ly superior to him and say that he is bad and I would have done better, but I want to let him know in a nice way that he needs to work on crowd reading, and remind him that he is playing music for the party, not himself.  What's a good way to do this?

**TL;DR**

See title of post.

**Edit:** This is a throwaway account because the DJ mentioned knows my regular account.  I'd post his tracklist so you can see just how off it was, but he would recognize it.  Suffice to say that it had no Halloween tracks/scary tracks, and was all 128bpm electrohouse bangers and 140 brostep screech.  I don't want this to be an argument about the genres, or about him being a laptop DJ, I just want advice on how to casually and politely let him know that he needs to work on playing to the crowd."	t5_2rddy	True

I figured this would help a bunch of you out. So without further ado, here's the system I use to keep my music folder organized, tagged, secured, and synchronized.

You don't have to follow all these steps or use the same exact setup as I do. You can customize your library in whatever way you like. This is aimed more towards showing you step-by-step how to use a few powerful library management tools. 

I might not cover everything in great detail, so if you have any questions with any of these steps or have additional questions that weren't covered in this post, feel free to comment and I'll get back to you.

Apparently, you can't make submissions longer than 10,000 characters, so I split up this post into sections in the comments. If you have any questions regarding a step in a certain section, PLEASE reply to the comment for the section in question.

**OVERVIEW**

****

* Again, [Here’s what we’re aiming for](http://i.imgur.com/PbDGq.png) in this tutorial
This should be present on both machines. Same drive letters and everything. Both of my machines have an S:\ Drive on them and they both have identical the same contents in the music directory. 

The reason why I’m having you use a different drive letter is to keep your music and your Traktor files separate from the same partition as your operating system. There are so many reasons as to why this is a good idea. We’ll also tell your user folder’s location to point to this new drive.  It makes things like backing up, synchronizing, and organizing your files a lot easier.

1338157068.0	u7tcf	How much time do you do nothing while DJing? (Calling all types of DJs) 	Teaelle	36	10	45	"Hear me out, I own the S2 and my fav genres are dubstep &amp; progressive house. I used to think that not having to beatmatch would save up so much time to do other fancy things, but then quickly realized beatmatching is pretty simple and takes no time at all, especially if you have good timing.

Now.. my worry lies on having TOO much free time and being bored. How do DJs deal with this? 

When I've been practicing, I usually play to the first drop and by the time the breakdown comes I bring in the next song. I've heard some mixes that literally play the whole song both drops.. and all I'm thinking in my head is what are they doing with themselves? I don't hear any FXs going off they must just be standing there.. AND if it was progressive house it would just be twice as long of waiting cause they are such long songs!! 

This made me also realize quickly that there are two different types of mixing. Performance mixing where you fuck the shit out of a song, and just regular mixing where the main focus is having the smoothest transitions. **What are the best times to use each method?**

I have my **first** couple gigs coming up. A performance show where i'll do a mashup for 10 mins or less, then DJing and hour of dub for the afterparty, and the second gig is just a house party. **I guess you could say I have a fear of people thinking I'm a shitty DJ cause I'm sitting there with nothing to do and just waiting for the break down to come.** Anyone else have that fear? I guess that's were being a little tipsy would help / interacting with the crowd.

Anywho I feel like I'm rambling, just give me some info on: 

* personal experiences 
* how you manage time (what you when the songs playing, besides looking for the next track)
* what genre you play
* how long you play a song
* weather you dj in a club 
* or house party
* or big event
* weather you play pre made sets or just off the dome 
* what you use (vinyl/cdjs/controller)

Just want to get a discussion going and hear some best and worst experiences! Thanks"	t5_2rddy	True

I opened a ticket with NI support on March 13 when I had issues with juggling cuepoints 5-8 on my S4. In the month that followed, they asked me to make a video of the problem, then took their sweet time replying. When they did reply, they gave me generic suggestions that I had already tried (reinstall the driver, replace the USB cable, try a different USB port). 

Fast forward three emails, two phone calls and a month later (April 13), they tell me I can send the unit back for repair. 
&gt;""We apologize for the delay.  Please expect your ups label to be in your email inbox within the next 1-2 business days.""

So I send in the S4 right away, and on May 2 they email me 
&gt;Your replacement order has been processed. Order #XXXXX - we are expecting to ship your replacement sometime within the coming week. We appreciate your patience as we are currently out of stock at our warehouse. We'll be able to ship your replacement as soon as possible once it's available.

Over the course of the next week I email them 3 times asking for updates and don't get a reply. Then this morning they send me a long email, telling me once again that they expect it ""this week"":

&gt;Hello Alex,
&gt;
&gt;We apologize for the inconvenience this has caused. Unfortunately, we are having some delays in receiving stock for your replacement. Rest assured we will be able to provide you with your shipping information once your order is shipped. We are hoping to receive them in stock shortly, as we have customers like yourself who are waiting for these units to arrive.
&gt;
&gt;We understand your frustration, and we can assure you we are doing everything we can to send you your unit as quickly as possible. While we would like to give you an exact date, it is unknown at this time when your replacement will be shipping. We are hoping to receive replacement into stock sometime this coming week. We will of course notify you that your replacement is being shipped, once it becomes available.
&gt;
&gt;Again, we apologize that you are experiencing a longer wait time then normal. However, we are doing what we can to have the next unit that is available shipped out to you. We appreciate all of your continued patience, and if you have any additional questions please let us know.
&gt;
&gt;Thank you

I haven't had my S4 for almost 2 months now and it has never fully worked. Does NI not give a fuck about us? I feel completely abandoned after spending $900 on this thing. 

tldr: i should've went with serato

EDIT: Consensus seems to be to stay away from NI and locked down controllers...any suggestions on better 4-deck controllers compatible with traktor (preferably with 8 cue point buttons)? I was really happy with this setup when it ""worked"".

EDIT 2: lol @ someone downvoting every one of my comments in this thread. peter from NI support, i know you're in here!

EDIT 3: just got an email from NI:

&gt;Your replacement order will be shipping tomorrow 5/23/2012. We should have tracking information available by the very end of the day. If you require a tracking number after the day of shipment, please let us know. We appreciate all of your patience."	t5_2rddy	True

I was told at last years event, the DJ they used played nothing but music not in their requested format, and was incredibly rude to them when asked for requests, even going as far as mocking their sexual orientation. Obviously, they did not invite him back, and he isn't DJing pretty much anywhere else on campus.

I went through the night staying polite, and doing what I could to get reasonable requests into the playlist. They couldn't say enough nice things about me at the end, and event added an additional half hours pay on top of what we already agreed to.

Never forget, fellow DJs, each gig you get leaves an impression on your clients! I know a lot of us like to try and do our own thing when we're behind the tables, but it's just as important to keep your clients happy.

1. Choose File &gt; Display Duplicates to show duplicate items (matches are based on the song name and artist). If you have multiple versions of the same song (for example, live and studio versions, or versions from different albums) you can **hold the Alt or Option key (for Mac OS X) or the Shift key (for Windows) and choose File &gt; Display Exact Duplicates.** This will show only duplicate songs having the same name, artist, and album.

My story goes that I was playing my set last week and then guy playing after me comes up and sets up his laptop next to the decks and starts plugging in to the back of the CDJs, with traktor open on his laptop I think. 
This got me interested, as I have never been one to use a laptop in DJing and dont know the benefits of doing it.

I rarely do anything as I (personally) like to play the music how it was produced. Though I think there are some interesting 'tricks' out there that really help make interesting transitions. So, what are the 'tricks' you do and how do you go about doing them?

So I'll get the ball rolling with one that you all probably know.

Sometimes I do a rewind when Mixing out of a track. I beat mix two tracks together and Kill the Bass on the track I'm mixing out of. Then when I'm ready to cut it out completely, I'll add about 50% of the bass back and spin the platter backwards while taking down the volume.

I learned that my equipment is shit, and that I should know its shit and be proud of it (well I wasn't exactly taught that). All of it has boosted my confidence and I have decided to pursue DJing into much more in depth. I've learned a lot, and still have a lot to learn. Thank you.

It would be similar to /r/photoshopchallenge, but instead of someone posting a source image, a thread would start off with ""Challenge: make a mix themed around clowns"" or ""Challenge: make a trance-sounding mix, but using songs less than 90 BPM or higher than 170 BPM"" for instance. It can be either someone challenging the community to make the mix or challenging themselves and asking for advice or suggestions. The comments can be suggested tracks or transitions or samples or anything along those lines.

Haven't worked out the logistics of the syntax or rules or anything, but I think this should give you a good idea of what I'm going for. Who else would be interested in it and would participate?

Edit: typos

Edit2: Thank you everyone for your feedback. It sounds like the idea of challenges would go over well with many people, but implementing it within a preexisting sub instead of creating a new one would be the ideal approach.

One involved a set-up where two CDJs were about 50 feet away from each other and I had to run back and forth to cue stuff up and beat-match it, add to that the fact that my music collection had someone turned into scratched R&amp;B CDs.

Yesterday's was the worst though. I'm playing at a big event, first track goes down well. I mix in the second fine but then a couple of minutes into it I look up and the dancefloor is totally empty save for two sniggering gingers who used to give me shit in high school.

I've been deejaying a year now after I went to my first rave and thought to myself ""I wanna be THAT guy on stage!""; And being the lucky bastard I am, I had my dad (a long time club dj) kind of help me out,it was great except i couldn't play what i wanted.I like to play house,electro,moombahton,etc. But he wanted me to be a top 40 dj like him, and would destroy my self esteem on my mixes.but he let me use his equipment so I always just agreed with him and promised to do better and play more top 40.the original set up was a denon mc6000 with virtual dj (yes I abused the sync button...) i learned some basics like what songs sound good together, effects, basic mixing,etc... well a few months down the line my dad got a pioneer ddj-t1(yes,another controller) i was thrilled because the little fanboy in me screamed ""omg pioneer!!!"". But around the same time I started deejaying with my cousin(a long time house/electro dj) he has a set of cdj900 and a djm700 pioneer setup.This scared the shit out of me... no laptop, no sync button...nothing.however He went through countless hours of trainwreck after trainwreck teaching me beatmatching.He was never negative like my dad,always encouraging me to put my hands back to the decks and try again! Recently my parents divorced and although i used the ddj-t1 only to keep the lessons fresh in my head,I left it with my dad. But my cousin told me I can come over any time to use his setup. Fast forward to july 3rd, i was at my cousins house having a party and a few of my cousins dj friends came by. We ended up bringing the decks outside and playing for everyone (family &amp;friends). I nervouslytook hold of the controls (I had only played in a closed bedroom or garage with no more than 2 people around) and played for 45 min solid no laptop,sync,nothing. When i gave the controls to my cousin he told me ""damn good job!!!"" And hugged me, everyone told me I did great including my cousins dj friends. 

I guess I'm just bragging and being a stupid kid(I'm 19) but I'm really proud of myself for coming this far and done as well as I have.this is going to get downvoted and destroyed but I just wanted to thank r/djs for helping me here and there with questions I had and to tell everyone my experience as a real dj now.

1361388042.0	18whxk	I've been DJ'ing for around 7 years and just landed my first residency! This community, along with DJTT, helped me get where I needed to go! AMA :)	BEERT3K	47	20	50	" Basically, I wanted to start a thread because I am lacking in the contribution department for a community that helped me learn some details that sped my DJ hobby/career along. I’ll list some of the obvious stuff and would love to get a dialog going with other DJ’s in a similar situation as well as those beyond or before where I’m at. Odds are this will die in “new” but w/e bored at work and I’ll post anyways.

Venue: Hybrid Bar/Club

Genre: Nu Disco / Deep Disco / Indie Dance

Setup: Macbook Pro+Traktor w/ Midifighter

	**I went from straight vinyl with external FX  to SSL and finally landed on the Traktor setup I use currently.

I started on Vinyl, then got cdjs, then TSP, then got a new set of cdjs with rekordbox capabilities but sold them and got 2 kontrol x1's but have quickly gotten bored of those and gone back to 2 tech 1210s (which i never sold).

I'm just wondering if it is just me or is anyone else completely bored about the challenges (or lack of) that the new technology in the DJ world bring? Using the kontrol x1, sure it allows you to mix 4 decks at once, but i felt myself really missing the beatmatching and beat riding feature from the tech 1200s."	t5_2rddy	True
