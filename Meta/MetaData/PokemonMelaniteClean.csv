We have about 2,000 new subscribers (Yay!) which is awesome, but I want to recap some things that the new people might now know. There is a FAQ in the sidebar. Read that before asking your question. Please, people who have been here a while, be patient with the new comers. They don't know a lot that you do. You asked a lot of questions when you were new too.

Now, to clear up a few things. The game IS NOT A HACK. It will run by itself as a .exe. Second, the Beta is OPEN. Everyone can play and download it. Third, the Beta goes a little past the 2nd gym. This is over 4 hours of gameplay, and there is plenty more to do in it then walk around and train.

Thank you everyone, and I'm sorry if I didn't respond to you in a thread here. There are so many replies I can't tell who I've responded to and who I haven't.

I shared some info about this game on Reddit for the first time about a year ago and when I made a sub I thought I would get maybe 100 or so subscribers. We are over 5000! Since I can't say when the game will be available for you to play, I want to offer something.

Would you like me to do a play through for about 30 minutes of the game and upload it to Youtube? It would obviously contain spoilers and spoil the beginning of the game, but you don't have to watch it if you don't want to. I just want to know if there is interest in this or not, because I won't do one if there isn't enough interest. I would also do a short poll before to ask what starter I should pick for the play through. I would probably stop short of the first gym. Maybe getting to Route 2.

Let me know what you think, and thanks for being AWESOME!!!"	t5_2uc2m	True

I added a fog effect to dusk forest. A fog effect is an image that covers a map and floats over. They are clouds very similar to the ones in the forest in DPPT. 

I am working on using similar methods to add rays of light shining whenever you exit a building/enter the overworld during the day. 

The game is fully playable through the 1st gym! I have done bug fixes and re played through multiple times. There is anywhere from 1-2 hours of gameplay in this depending on if you skip through talks, explore everything, train more, etc. I also finished Route 3, which is north of Lily Town.

Now, the first gym allows you to use CUT not ROCK SMASH. It fits better with the environment and makes more sense as it is normal type. I am currently working on designing Vetus Town. I will post a screenshot from Vetus Town sometime this weekend, hopefully with the new sunlight effect I want to add.



Also, in case anyone is wondering, the HMs in order received are

*CUT-Given by Rival and requires Typic Badge

*ROCKSMASH-Given by Yang and requires Fossil Badge

*SURF-Given by Indian Chief and requires Pearl Badge

*STRENGTH-Found in Desert Resort and requires Pyramid Badge

*DIVE-Given by Scuba Diving Club Leader and requires Bolt Badge

*FLY-Given by Rival and requires Absorption Badge

*WHIRLPOOL(I will need to implement this into the game as it is not in Essentials by default)-Found in Poison Darkout and requires Venom Badge

*WATERFALL-Given by Rival and requires (unnamed dragon type) badge

Pokemon Melanite will soon go into a private beta for catching bugs and fixing grammar issues and such. Anyone is welcome to submit a form, but few will be chosen. The Beta includes the first 2 gyms, plenty of the story, and at least 4 hours of gameplay. (okay it could probably be done in 2-3 if you rush through everything but there's no fun in that.)

If I have promised you Beta Testing at some point or another, please let me know by commenting here, or sending me a private message. I probably already let you know that I have a bad memory and will forget about you. (Sorry) Anyone I have talked to about Beta Testing please do this.

Please do not send me PMs asking to be in Beta testing unless the above applies. I will not respond, and it will drastically hurt your chances. Now, without further ado, the form!

Please take your time and fill out every question. Thanks again to everyone who has followed the game, offered advice, and told your friends about it. Soon, everyone will be able to play the Beta.

I got a LOT of ideas from you and a lot of questions and I don't want to respond to 20+ comments. Here are my responses to some commonly mentioned things.

* Poison animation and sound and stat lowering animation and sound are the same. **Read the bottom of this post**
* Bubble text box for NPC's talking has a line between the arrow and the box. **That will be EXTREMELY time consuming and difficult to fix, but I WILL try.**
* Music looping issues. **Working on it. I'm going to try to do something with an intro and then the main part loops, same for battle music**
* Spelling/Grammar **I have fixed everything that was brought up, and more will be fixed in Beta Testing**
* Lens Flare looks Awesome! **Thanks I thought it was a nice touch.**
* Why is Sneasel mad at you? **When you talk to your pokemon they will sometimes have items, sometimes say they like the music and a number of other things. Lot's of the time though talking to your pokemon will show how happy they are. Since I just go sneasel his/her (can't remember what gender it was) happiness was really low still**
* Some text is hard to read because of the color (mainly on options screen) and any text that is red is really hard to read **I have changed all red text and anything unreadable to either white or a nice pinkish color that is REALLY easy to read on any of the text box options.**
* Reflections in water are messed up **I know. There is no real way to fix this without completely reworking that script. You're going to have to live with it, or I could turn them off completely.**
* Fog, birds, special affect things look amazing. **Thanks again:D and someone asked why the birds seemed to happen so often. They fly over and back every time you enter the map. The pokemon are different depending on the time of day.**
* Animated battlers look amazing/look too pixelated. **Some people said both of these. They are the sprites from BW/BW2 and they are supposed to be pixelated. Thank you if you thought they looked cool.**
* WILL THIS GAME BE PLAYABLE ON MAC??? **With Wine yes.**
* Arrow keys are messed up on the controls screen. **I fixed it.**
* Menu. **I am now going to add labels to the menu so you know what is selected if you can't tell by the image. Thanks for all the comments saying you liked it**
* Poisoned effect while walking around is off. **The screen doesn't flicker when you have a poisoned pokemon in your party. Instead it blinks red. Poison fades away with 1 HP left like in 4th gen, but still effects in the field unlike BW/BW2.**
* I love how the items in the field appear as what they are. **Thank you. I thought it would be cool.**
* EXP bar filling noise is missing. **THANK YOU. I need to do something about that.**
* Menu sound levels are too high. **I personally thought they were ok. I'm going to keep them unless this gets a lot of comments saying I should lower them.**
* Forest entrance/exit tiles look weird. **I am still looking for good tiles for that. The shadow is a place holder.**


Now, this is what I plan on doing next.

* Fix the text bubbles if I can.
* Fix menu a bit to make it easier to understand
* Add as many attack animations as I can. This is my main goal at the moment right now. Especially status effect things that will come up a lot.

First a progress update.

*I scripted in a new field move which will replace whirlpool and be a surprise.

*Vetus Town is made, yet not playable.

*Route 4-5 are planned

*The second gym is almost done being designed. It has two puzzles. 1) the Ruins of Alph Tile Game from HGSS, and 2) wild pokemon hiding in rocks that jump out and attack you.

*A great guy named ScreenHunter is helping fix the menu system a bit to make the pokedex better.

So, the contest. I am making the second gym right now, and I thought of a cool idea. I am going to let you guys design the third gym. That is, as long as I like it too, and it fits. The gym is water type. I am not going to make many restrictions, but if the idea is too silly, don't expect it to be in the game. Also, you can suggest an idea for the gym's puzzle if you don't want to draw out a design. Just post an image link in the comments and upvote the best ones!

If you are chosen you will receive a notification from me by the end of the week at the latest. I will not be posting a list of the chosen people. If you are chosen it is up to you if you want it to be known. I do this so you aren't spammed by people asking you questions. "	t5_2uc2m	True
1361418295.0	18xl5h	Eeveelutions	rayd12smitty	72	11	14	"As many of you know, there is still a possibility of new Eevee Evolutions appearing in the game. I personally think 17 Evolutions for Eevee is too many. I am still all for putting all 10 new evolutions in the game though, since they are so popular with all of you.

Now, I have someone who is making backsprites for them, and someone started making shiny forms. Also, little things like footprints have been started. There are still 2 main things I am missing before they could be put in the game. 

1.) Cries - everypokemon has a specific sound it makes. This is a major issue as they are not very easy to make, and must sound good, and similar enough to existing cries be real.

2.) Overworld Sprites - I just thought of this recently. As you know, your pokemon can follow you outside its Pokeball in Melanite. I need full sprite sets of the new eevees as well. 

Please post if you think you would be able to help with cries/overworld sprites. I may turn you down if there is someone offering better quality work. Don't be offended, I may have to be honest and say your work isn't good enough to keep the quality of the game. Also, please post your opinions on which ones are your favorite, in case not all 10 are put in the game."	t5_2uc2m	True

Extra things that sound awesome with this are random trainer generation (or a list where trainers are picked from) and a large prize at the end of it.

* Added Attack Animations for all status effects and about 150 moves. The game now has all the animations that have been made for Pokemon Essentials. As more are made I will add them.
* Finished Mapping Vetus Town and Mapped Route 4
* Fixed a HUGE gamebreaking bug on Route 3 which I hadn't been able to figure out for months
* Attempted to fix text bubbles but failed... Sorry guys they are going to stay how they are.
* Palm Trees are Headbuttable now :D
* When a repel runs out you are asked if you want to use another one. (You're welcome XD)


Two more maps until the second gym! Progress is being made. In case anyone is wondering...

Route 4 is a beachside route that zigzags a bit back onto normal land and up into the start of the mountains. It connects with Vetus Town and leads into Route 5.

Route 5 is in the Mountain Range that comes around Origin Mountain. It connects with Route 4 and leads into Split Soul Town, and the second gym.


One more thing. I am considering dropping the PokeDev and just using a normal PokeGear. I'm having issues and I honestly don't think it's worth it.

1356579378.0	15i1ah	PLEASE READ BEFORE ASKING QUESTIONS	rayd12smitty	62	8	48	"I understand many people are new here. I don't like answering the same questions/concerns over and over, so here is the answers to the questions you have.

**1. THE STARTERS**
They are Croagunk, Sneasel, and Natu. I know that they have a strange weakness pattern, with Natu not being able to effect Sneasel with its psychic attacks. This is meant to add a level of difficulty to the game if Natu is picked. I am sorry if you personally don't like one of the starters, you can pick a different one if you don't want it.

**2. NO THE GAME IS NOT RELEASED**
The game is still in development. I hope to have a demo sometime in Spring with 3 gyms. There will be beta testing. It has not started. The game will be completely free to download.

**3. FAKEMON**
As of now fakemon are NOT in the game. There is a small possibility that there will be a few fakemon, no guarantee, and not likely at this point.

**4. THIS IS NOT A HACK**
No, this is not a ROM. It will run as an .exe file. This means that only PC's can play it, unless you have a PC emulator or a third party program.

**5. THE POKEDEX**
The Zela Region Pokedex contains 285 pokemon. 8 of these are legendary. There will be a 100 pokemon expansion post elite 4 which will include over 20 more legendaries. The Hoenn and Kanto starters will be obtainable, but the Kanto starters not until post elite four.

**6. EVOLUTIONS**
Many Pokemon will have changed evolutions. There won't be any traded evolutions to keep it so every Pokemon can evolve. There will be different methods. Some will become level up, some will be learn a move, some will be item, I am not telling.

I apologize for sounding harsh. Please just don't ask these questions anymore. Feel free to ask any other questions in the comments."	t5_2uc2m	True

1356655321.0	15jp4a	Game History	rayd12smitty	61	9	12	"Pokemon Melanite Version is a Pokemon Fan Game being developed in RPG Maker XP, using Pokemon Essentials by Flameguru, Poccil, and Maruno. This game actually began in September of 2011, and was planned to be a Christmas present for my youngest brother. The game was to be called ""Pokemon Darkest Shadows"", and feature shadow Pokemon. However, I soon learned that I was far too inexperienced to even try to make a video game, and the project was abandoned. 

For the next few months, I watched other similar projects, and studied RPG Maker, and Pokemon Essentials. I began to understand how things worked, and found an idea forming in my head. I thought of a completely new idea for a game. 

I was playing ""Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Darkness"" and really liked how Darkrai was portrayed. Pure. Evil. An idea began to form. In Pokemon D/P/Pt, there was downloadable content, that allowed the player to battle Darkrai in a dream. What if Darkrai wanted this to happen? What if Darkrai used this trainer to escape New Moon Island? A gigantic story build around this, taking place 30 years after D/P/Pt. 

I restarted my project, this time under the name ""Pokemon Melanite"". I created a region map, and started planning towns and gym leaders. This time, I was more organized, and didn't start the game making right away. However, just after restarting, my computer crashed. Everything I had was lost, and I started school again. I thought the project would remain dead, until about a month ago, November 2012, when I decided to continue it.

Things took off. I started a whole new style, new maps, better graphics. Hopefully, a Demo will be coming soon, and my brother, and the entire community, will be able to play the game I promised. "	t5_2uc2m	True

* Custom color selection

* Step Counter

* Tally Counter

* Clock - On Main Screen

* Minigames?

* Casino Credit - (Coins)

* Special Pass for Post Game Islands

Please give ideas for ""Apps"" and designs. I want to make this a helpful menu options that can do more than view a map. New name ideas for the PokeGear are also welcome. The icon in the menu is a wristband computer device like thing.

1356656680.0	15jqfv	Game Story	rayd12smitty	51	10	14	"The game features a brand new region known as Zela. It is located to the north west of Sinnoh, and created by Arceus at the same time. 30 years ago, a great evil arose and tried to bring an everlasting darkness over the land. Fortunately, three great trainers, and theri mentor were able to stop it. But now, the evil is rising again, and only you can stop it.

30 years ago, it all started. One young boy from Twinleaf Town in Sinnoh, was visiting Canalave City. He walked up to the strange house that was always locked. Something was different this time though. When the boy walked up, the door opened, and a strange man let him in. The boy instantly felt drowsy, and fell asleep in the bed. He dreamed, but it was more than a dream. The boy found himself on an island. There was a strange Pokemon he had never seen before ahead of him. He reached for a Pokeball and the battle began. The boy captured the legendary Pokemon Darkrai, and woke up. A few days later though, Darkrai escaped the Pokeball, and fled, to the region of Zela.

There, he sought out the Tree of Life, where balance was kept in the world. However, he found the way blocked. Before Darkrai could do anything, three young trainers, Alice, Yang, and Yin, along with their mentor battled and defeated Darkrai, and with the help of Celebi trapped him in time, in the basement of Shroud Pillar. The world was safe.

You are a young boy/girl who has lived in Lily Town all your life. It is a good life, but you have always wanted to be adventurous. Your mother however, never let you leave town. You leave home one day to visit the neighbors, but on your way you run into a strange old man. The man is talking to himself, and bumps into you. He studies you for a strange amount of time, and asks for your name. He jumps, but soon hides his excitement, apologizes for bothering you, and heads toward the forest. You follow him. Dusk Forest is a dangerous place, filled with wild Pokemon and is unsafe without a partner Pokemon. Curiosity gets the best of you, and you follow the man in. After walking a short while, the man stops and turns to face you. ""I know you have been following me. Do not be afraid, I mean you no harm. I can't say the same for the Pokemon hiding in the grass around us though."" You jump as wild Spinarak and Ariados jump out to attack you. ""Quick follow me!"" You have no choice to follow the man into a strange lab up ahead. You pass out just after getting inside.

When you wake up, the man is pacing, and rushes to your side. He says you did well for seeing a dangerous wild Pokemon for the first time. The man introduces himself as a Pokemon Professor by the name of Oak. You are faced with a predicament however, as Prof. Oak doesn't have time to bring you back to town, and you can't go out by yourself. After thinking for a moment, he decides to give you a Pokemon to use to protect yourself. You walk over to a table where he places three Pokeballs. The Pokemon inside pop out, to show Croagunk, Sneasel, and Natu. You pick one, and the Professor explains that some Pokemon like to follow their trainer. Your starter pops out of its Pokeball. You leave the lab and head back home.

Long story short, your mother is worried sick and glad to see you safe. She heals you and your Pokemon, and tells you to go and thank Prof. Oak for saving your life. However, when you get back, the professor is gone. There is a box with a letter, telling you to take the items inside and go to Novum town, and find a trainer named Alice. You take the Pokedex and Pokeballs inside, and begin your journey.

You travel the region, unraveling ancient secrets, growing stronger by defeating gym leaders and the mysterious Team Masquerade. You soon discover that Darkrai has escaped his ancient prison, and once again wants to destroy the world, by plunging it into eternal darkness. Only you, with the help of a young boy from a neighboring town, Alice, the two ancient guardians of Zela, and Professor Oak, can stop Dakrai and save the world."	t5_2uc2m	True

I spent just about the entire day today (8 hours) eventing. This is the process of creating events that make up the game. Anything you interact with or that interacts with you needs to be made. And, after being made, it needs to be tested, and tested, and tested. From those 8 hours I spent, about 15 minutes of gameplay was made, depending on if you stop and read everything. I am very happy with this. As of now, you can play through getting your starter, and your first battle.

More good news. Pokemon WILL follow you. I just finished reimplementing this feature and by some miracle it worked perfectly the first time. I have decided not to post the results directly from the survey. I will give you an overview though. I received over 300 votes, so thank you for sharing your opinions.

The Fakemon: The results were close, but no fakemon came out on top, by about 5%. That is settled, I don't want to here any more about it. Fakemon will NOT be in the game.

The starters and mascot: Will stay the same. The vast majority voted for this.

Getting a Pokemon to rival your rival: This was really close all around. I am still unsure as to what I will do with this.


And finally, the post I put to thank all you wonderful people for subscribing. The clear winner was wanting to see the starter select screen. I will post screens this weekend.

Thanks for all the positive response to the choosing a starter screens I posted. The update today isn't as big as last time, but I want to keep you up to date with the game.

So far, you can play through Route 1. All the trainers and wild pokemon are working perfectly. If you are wondering my team right now consists of sneasel and ralts. The pokecenter and pokemart in Novum Town are fully functional. You can buy and sell, use the PCs, heal your Pokemon, and lots more.

I have looked at all the suggested names and come up with the following.

Normal: Eeveeon - From Eevee

Fighting: Brawleon - Brawl, fight, simple enough

Flying: Aveon - From aviation

Rock: Oreon - From ore

Steel: Automeon - As in automaton

Ground: Terreon - From Terra

Poison: Toxeon - From toxin or toxic

Bug: Vermeon - As in vermin. I liked Hemiptereon too but it seems too long

Ghost: Obliveon - As in oblivion

Dragon: Draconeon - As in drake. I wanted one more to be slightly longer. Otherwise I would have taken Drakeon.

Now, for stats. This has to be planned right. All Eeveelutions have a stat total of 525, and no individual stat lower than 60, or higher than 130. I am fine with going below 60 or over 130, but I want to keep the 525 max. Please post opinions for which stats would match which type/design. 

Ex. I think brawleon should have high attack stats, moderate spc. attack stats, and balanced everything else.

Aveon and Vermeon both seem like they should have higher speeds.

Oreon looks slower, and could be more bulky with defense.

Please post opinions and stat spreads below.

If you want to suggest a full idea here is the form

Name:

As you have most likely noticed a lot has been done in the last week or two. Gym leaders, multiple new/redone maps, the pokedex, and lots more has been done. I really don't want to give too many more maps away, as I want to save something for the actual releases. However, I propose a deal. If we can get 1000 subscribers by 12-21-12 (END OF THE WORLD :D) and we survive to live to 12-22-12, I will release a full map of all the towns and routes leading up to the first gym. This will include the 2nd route, and the first bigger city.

Thanks for being awesome. Spread the word, tell your friends, create new accounts, and I will post again soon.

Arrow Keys - Movement

C - Select (The A Button on a Gameboy)

X - Back/Menu (The B Button on a Gameboy that is also used to open the menu)

Z - Run

S - Toggle Run/Walk

A - Toggle Hud On/Off


Controls **ARE CUSTOMIZABLE** Here is what you can do

You will have to mess around with it though to figure out what does what. The button given is the actual key on your keyboard. The drop down button next to it is what the game uses as an input. This is what each Input listed in the drop down menu does.

* C - Select something. Pretty much the A button on a gameboy
* B - The B button on a gameboy and opens the menu
* A - Hold down to run
* X - Toggle the HUD on and off
* Y - Toggle run/walk

Remember, the list directly above is NOT keys on your keyboard. They are Inputs used by the game. The key listed to the left of the drop down menu is the key on your key board. I know this is confusing but it's the best I can do to explain how it works. Every control is custom if you know how to do it except for the registered item. I am working on changing this right now. As of now you press F5 to use a registered item. I am working on changing it to a new input which will be Input Z, the D Key on your keyboard."	t5_2uc2m	True

I have spent the last half hour or so adding in attack animations and such and it takes forever:/ I have all the weather/status effects done. No attacks yet, and there is something you guys can do that will make it go faster. The animations that have been made so far can be found here:
http://pokemonessentials.wikia.com/wiki/All_Animations_Project

When you download an animation, it gives you 2 to 3 files.
* A .png image
* A sound effect (not included in every one)
* A .anm file

The problem is each one is put in a folder with these 3 things, and I have to take them and put them in the respective folder and then import the animation. What I need someone to do is this; Download all animations except for the status and weather effect ones (all the actual move animations) and separate the 3 files into folders. One folder for the .pngs, one folder for the sound effects, and one folder for the .anm

If someone could do this and then send me the 3 folders, I could put all the animations in that are available very easily and much quicker. I know this will take up a lot of your time, so whoever does this is guaranteed to get into Beta Testing. That is all I really have to offer. Comment if you are interested:D

Very recently, someone released [this app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.kernys.rgss&amp;hl=en), which translates RGSS, the coding language used in RPG Maker XP, to work with Android. This means that RPG Maker games can now be played on Android devices using this app. The only problem is, Pokemon Essentials starter kit is very different from a standard RPG Maker XP game, and does not work completely yet with this app. Most people who have tried their Pokemon games have had them crash at the title screen. 

Luckily, Flameguru, one of the original people who worked on Essentials, has contacted the person who developed this app, and asked if he can have the code, or parts of it, and help make the app work for Pokemon Essentials games, like Melanite. I just wanted to let you all know this, as many of you want to play this on your phones. There is still no way to play this on iDevices, and the game won't work currently with this app most likely. I don't have any android devices to I can't really try for myself. Once Melanite is released on the 20th, by all means see if it will work, but most likely it won't. Hopefully, Flameguru will be able to make this work! That's all now. I won't be posting any new stuff until the 20th probably. Thanks for taking the time to read this."	t5_2uc2m	True

**Edit** So some of you wanted to know what made me chose who I chose. After reading through about 300 responses there were different reasons why people were picked. I'm going to be honest with you, I didn't pick people always because they were the most experienced. Many people were picked for this reason, but not everyone. Some people's entries made me laugh, some people were chosen simply for variety. I didn't want a team of all boys ages 18-22. Some people were picked simply because of the starter they said they would pick. I can now tell without a  doubt sneasel is most popular.

1363213803.0	1a8v6q	Something concerning Gym Leaders (an Idea)	SpatulaPower	43	9	14	"So, if there's always one thing I've absolutely **HATED** about Pokemon games, it's the fact that you can't re-battle **ANY** of the gym leaders, unless I'm forgetting some end game thing in a battle frontier type place (don't remember if that exists or not). Anyway, all I'm proposing is that maybe Ray could add a feature that allows you to re-battle gym leaders again and again, although each time their Pokemon get a significant level increase, until they hit the maximum level, where they would stay. This would:

1: Allow players to get more than one of a particular TM (unless Ray's going with the Black/White aspect of TM's)

2: Re-battle leaders with different type match ups (which would make the game more interesting if you decided to beat it with a Pokemon with a type advantage)

3: Make leveling slightly less difficult.


But then this poses the problem that you could just beat all the gym leaders once more before fighting the Elite 4 and get more exp than you could have in a normal Pokemon game.

My solution? Ray **could**, I'm not saying he'd have to if he used this idea, put a difficulty option at the beginning of the game. (Normal or Hard, Normal being when you can re-battle, Hard when you cannot.)

Just a thought.

Anyway, the following contains **SPOILERS** to the story. I repeat **SPOILERS** ahead. Don't keep reading if you don't want **SPOILERS** I warned you.


So, I am assuming if you are reading this you know the backstory to the game. Lucas, the hero from DPPT captures Darkrai on Newmoon Island. Darkrai however, planned it, and soon escapes Lucas. Darkrai is mad at the world for being so bright and cheery. He has never fit in, and never will. People are scared of him, and rightly so. Dakrai plans his revenge on the world. He escapes Sinnoh west to the Zela Region. There, he tries to discover the Orbs of Order and Chaos, and destroy their balance. Luckily, a young trainer named Alice, along with her mentor Prof. Oak, and two others are able to stop Darkrai before it is too late. 

Until now, these two trainers have been Yin and Yang, but who were they before that? That is what I thought of last night. I may have said this before, but I will say it again. This game includes things and people from many Pokemon Movies and TV Shows. This is one instance. 

The two other trainers are Lucas and Paul. Paul is just like he was in the Anime. Cruel, and only caring about power, that is until he met Lucas, who eventually changed him. The two became great friends, and Paul becomes friendlier towards Pokemon. So, once Darkrai escapes Lucas, he and Paul visit Prof. Oak. Oak is wise and realizes that Dakrai is up to something, and goes with Lucas and Paul to Zela. There, they meet Alice, and the four of them stop Dakrai. Dakrai is locked away, and Pokemon come from the orbs of Order and Chaos, Reshiram and Zekrom. They give themselves to Lucas(Zekrom) and Paul(Reshiram) and they become known as Yin and Yang. (Paul=Yang) (Lucas=Yin).


Now, where the player comes in. You have grown up and lived with your mom your whole life in Lily Town. Your mom refuses to move anywhere, but never tells you why. You have never seen your father. Here is where it all ties together. There are two caves holding parts of a prophecy, telling that you are the only one who can stop Dakrai when he comes again. 

You don't find out why you are chosen until the very end. Lucas/Yin is your father, and Paul/Yang is your rival's.

First off though, I would like to clear something up. There have been a lot of concern about the starters in the game, as well as Fakemon. I will address these two issues separately. 

First off, the starters. I chose croagunk, sneasel, and natu, not only to be different, but also because they are some of my personal favorites, and because they set a difficulty level to the game. Many of you have heard this before, but I will say it again for those who haven't. Croagunk would be setting an easy difficulty, the first two gyms are weak against you, and you really don't have any gym weaknesses until the ground gym and the flying elite four. Sneasel would be the normal difficulty. You would have some trouble every few gyms, but nothing extraordinary. Now, if you pick natu, you are gonna have a rough time. Not really because of the gyms, although the champion will be near impossible if you don't build a strong team, but because you can't touch your rival. I made it like that for a reason.

Now, I have heard concerns along the lines of: ""But natu doesn't learn any good attacks"" or ""But they evolve at completely different times, and sneasel needs an item"" or ""I don't like the pokemon natu, I hate it so it shouldn't be put in the game"" For those who don't know, I am changing the way many things work. The starters will have improved stats, learn better attacks, and all evolve around the high 20s. For those who just have a personal dislike for a pokemon, suck it up, you can pick a different starter.

There has been a lot of talk lately about Fakemon. So far, 150 people have answered the servey and the results are exactly tied with the first question, which makes me think I should keep it the way I planned, with no fakemon. I will however wait for more people, and then see, and if there is an overwhelming majority of people who want fakemon, I will make something work.


Now that thats settled, a few weeks ago I made a promise of a Christmas present. I have two of them for you. If you don't want **Spoilers** you don't have to look at them.

1376547383.0	1kekes	What is the difficulty level?	ironcrown9	28	4	6	"I just stumbled into this tonight (And it seems to be a very good time to do so from the look of the release date!).

My question is pretty straightforward. What is the intended difficulty level of Melanite? In line with the regular Pokemon games? A little tougher, a littler easier? 
Is there plans for adjustable difficulty levels? An instruction set for fiddling with the files? Some sort of possible future patch?

The reason I went digging for fan-made games is I'm looking for a challenge, and the only thing I've found is mods to get the hard version from Black 2 from the start.

 Of course I understand that things like difficulty levels are a pain to make and hell to balance. That said, I think that something along those lines would be a pretty neat feature.

Oh, and I wanna give you(the creator, if you read this) massive props for this project. I've worked on some fangames, and I know that even if you recycle code it's still a lotta work.

1357620355.0	165zq9	Just wondering something	A_O_A_B	27	4	10	From what i've read thus far on the subreddit is that the game will be released as a .exe file which is great for everyone that uses a PC but not for us mac users. I know that emulating on the mac is more touch and go then on the PC but I personally use a mac for all my home base operations (I do have a separate partition for PC but I find it a hassle to switch over just to play roms). Basically what I want to know is if this has the possibility of being released for both platforms or as a .ips, I do apologize if this question has already been ask or if this may seem like me making a fuss out of something small it's just an honest concern of mine	t5_2uc2m	True

It was very unprofessional of me not to check things out and test them in multiple environments before making a release. My only excuse is I got excited, and forgot to take necessary steps. Luckily this is an easy fix. No one should have trouble accessing the file for download anymore. Check the link to mediafire for that. Now, once you download that, wait and do these steps first.

1. Go to this page: http://www.rpgmakerweb.com/download/run-time-package

2. Agree to the terms and download the Run Time Player

3. Install it on your computer

Now when you try to decompress the game file, and play it, you won't get an error message(I Pray). 

There is another way to fix it so that you don't need the RTP (Run Time Player) but it is too late for this one. If you don't want to install the RTP and want to see the pokedex, you can check my link to the google.docs page. All future releases will not require the RTP. I apologize again for the inconvenience.

It really means a lot to me to be receiving so many messages and posts about how the game is going and your concerns. To be completely honest, very little has been done within the last month. After computer problems about a month and a half ago, and losing very much work, I was worried to start over again knowing i may lose it all again. i may have found a scripter which is something i have wanted for a very long time. He is in college and very busy with work, and i am busy as well as of late. 

All this aside, the game is still very much a WIP. I have no intentions of stopping, but the end of the year demo is most likely not going to happen. I am not going to promise anything, as I dont want to raise hopes and then crush them. 

I want to make up for all this by making this thread an official ""Ask Me ANYTHING"" thread. I will answer any questions anyone has about the game, or myself, or anything even slightly related. I intend to make this game the best it can be. Anyone who wants this to be just that, should message or post here with anything they can think of to add, or change.

I once again apologize to everyone, and Jack (ThePancakeEskimo) sorry for not making much contact with you about any of this. I lost your email address when my computer crashed and never thought to message you.

I have finished deciding and ordering the pokemon, to the best of my sorting abilities, and come up with a pokedex of 285. The region has 8 legendaries. I tried my best to make everyone happy, while still fitting my needs, and the region's biomes. Many people complain about too many legendaries so I tried to cut it down. However, there are still many people that want every single legendary. To accommodate for this, the post elite-four game will feature an upgrade to the pokedex that will include 100 new pokemon, including just over 20 legendaries. I won't say any more for now, as I want to keep it a surprise for when I release the full pokedex sometime tomorrow (I hope).



Now, my real question for posting. I have thought long about it, and can't decide on how I will share the pokedex with you. I have come down to 2 options that I think will work. 

1. I simply give you a list of all the pokemon and their regional dex number. This is the more boring option, but will work easily for everyone.


2. I give you a download for the game. Don't get excited yet. All this will be is a simple introduction saying this is just a pokedex viewing and then spawn you in a room with a pokedex to pick up and then look through. I am more in favor of this option, since it is interactive, and will let you see the pokedex in full and it's features. The only problems are people with macs won't be able to see it or participate, and people may have trouble downloading it. 


Let me know which option you like more, or if you have one to suggest."	t5_2uc2m	True

1356141977.0	159dxj	Melanite Suggestions	Gurchimo	21	7	21	"This will be a slightly lengthy post concerning some decent things that I think will make the game better. 

**Topic I: Type Disadvantage**

I figured it would be a good idea to give the Trainers a Pokemon that helps counter their rival, sort of like when you got one of the elemental monkeys in Pokemon BW. Example: A trainer early on sees you and your rival after a battle. He/she would talk about how important type advantage is, and they give you a 

Sandshrew if you picked Sneasel

Venonat if you picked Natu

Swinub if you picked Croagunk

This way, if a starter easily KO'ed you with a 4x effective move, you have help to counter your rival.

**Topic II: Fakemon**

For those who don't know, ""Fakemon"" are fake monsters within a fan game. With the help of an artist, I think it would be cool to have a fair share of Fakemon. Recently, I've seen a fan game with too many Fakemon or completely Fakemon often fail because most are not appealing. I would like to propose Fakemon ideas later on, and for an artist to create it (with Ray's permission, of course). After this, to ensure viewer's visual appeal, we would hold a ""beta testing"" group, if you will, to see if the selected audience likes it.

Anyway, I have two computers, one of which is a desktop (custom built, up-to-date hardware) and the other is a laptop that was outdated when it was bought (no external graphics card, Intel Pentium processor, 3 GB of RAM)


---

After playing on both computers:

On my **desktop** everything loads fine, no problems when loading new maps, entering battles, etc. It gets perfect FPS.

On my **laptop** only quite small maps would give decent FPS (around 20-ish), larger maps took at least 2 seconds to load, and FPS was usually about 10 (approximation) entering battles would lag, essentially everything is kinda slow.

**TL;DR** 2 computers, laptop is 3 years old, desktop is brand new, laptop has a lot of trouble running the game, desktop one works perfect.

---
**Recommended specs (In my opinion)**

* Intel I-Series (Any) (Or AMD equivalent, sorry, don't know it off the top of my head)
* At least 2-4 GB of ram
* Graphics card is no problem, as long as it can load 32 pixels 
* At least 500 MB of hard drive space

1364745880.0	1bd2b2	Regarding the Heroes Tournament in the Pokémon Master Tournament (Possible Teams)	Globagoz	6	0	5	"I'd like to venture a suggestion for the teams of the protagonists at the heroes tournament (I presume that it consists of Protagonists?). They could follow Red's team's format, with all three starters and some story Pokémon.

**Red/Leaf:** Red's existing team

**Ethan/Lyra:** Feraligatr, Meganium, Typhlosion, Shiny Gyarados, Togetic and Sudowoodo

This is the easiest one as it shares many parallel's with Red's team. Three starters, a Pokémon which blocks the road, a water-type and a non-fully evolved 'mascot' of the generation.

**Brendan/May:** Swampert, Blaziken, Sceptile, Castform, Metagross and Wynaut/Absol

This one was more tricky. The player recieves a Beldum and Castform, but then the only egg they recieve contains a Wynaut, which evolves into a Gen II Pokémon. Absol is an alternative, as it's rare and popular, but, as far as I know, there aren't any more 'story' Pokémon.

**Lucas/Dawn:** Infernape, Torterra, Empoleon, Riolu/Lucario, Togekiss, Porygon-Z

This one has Pokémon obtained in the story, Riolu and Togepi as eggs on Iron Island and in Eterna City respectively, while Porygon is a gift in Veilstone City. All of them are fully evolved (unless Riolu is unevolved), but apart from that, they fit pretty well.

**Hilbert/Hilda:** Samurott, Serperior, Emboar, Zoroark/Zorua, Darmanitan (with Zen Mode) and Volcarona/Larvesta

All of these are obtained via the story, and if you wanted to stick with the 'unevolved' theme then Zorua or Larvesta could be unevolved, although if you used the Volcarona caught at Relic Castle instead of the Larvesta in an egg then it would have to be Zorua.

**Nate/Rosa:** Samurott, Serperior, Emboar, Sawsbuck/Deerling, Crustle and Shiny Haxorus

Again, all of these are story Pokémon. Crustle is the equivalent of Snorlax and Sudowoodo, blocking up part of the Great Chasm, while Sawsbuck is received as a Deerling so could be unevolved, while Haxorus is found in the Nature Preserve.

Please offer any constructive criticism over these teams. I really hope I was right about the Heroes Tournament consisting of Protagonists, otherwise this post is a bit useless! Thanks."	t5_2uc2m	True

I this will probably be difficult, but I had this idea for flying in Melanite.	chattypenguin	4	1	0	"I always loved how when you surfed in the games, you could fight the Pokemon there and actually ride on your own.

You just got the Fly TM. You teach it to your staraptor and decide to head back to Lily Town. You climb on top of your Pokemon's back lift up, and begin soaring through the clouds. You can control the direction and speed of flight. This is the same thing as surfing or walking, except it's in the sky.......A WILD SKARMORY APPEARED.....What will staraptor do? Staraptor uses Areoblast! A critical hit! Skarmory uses Steel wing! 

So yeah, something like that would be truly awesome. Imagine commanding your Pokemon to attack *while in the sky* and it attacking the Pokemon *while you're on top of it*. And you could battle trainers in the sky too. I would just love it if you do this."	t5_2uc2m	True

1361234069.0	18sak9	EV training suggestion (If willing)	Luckcu13	4	2	0	"I was thinking, what if the EV system was set up differently, to be more like what we see in the anime. (Ash usually trains his Pokemon's moves, without the use of abusing wild Pokemon) Here it goes.


The EV system I'm thinking of isn't about how many wild Pokemon you beat up. It's now about the moves that you use. Each time you use a move, your Pokemon will have one or more EV points to gain when you defeat the Pokemon. The moves you use will cause which EV point you gain from fighting the wild Pokemon. For example, Quick Attack/Extremespeed increases speed, and Flamethrower/Ember/Water Gun will increase Special Attack, and Tackle/Bite increases Physical Attack. Defensive moves, besides giving a temporary boost, will also increase your base Defense stat after the battle. Same with Special Defense moves, and so on. Defense can also increase by the sort of attack you receive, but I'm sure that would end up making the perfect Pokemon harder. Natures can affect how easily it is to EV train a specific area, but it doesn't have an effect on base stats to a Pokemon. For example, a Pokemon with Mild nature will increase the EVs gained in Special Attack by 1.5, but it would probably multiply the EVs gained in Defense by only 0.7, 0.8, or even 0.5. This makes training harder, but still lets you create the perfect Pokemon, and hopefully not cause tons of Pokemon to stay stuck on a PC.


TMs can help you train your Pokemon in EVs by giving them the moves necessary. Some moves are more effective at EV training then others. For example, Quick Attack gives one EV, while Extremespeed gives three EV points. Overheat only gives one EV point in Special Attack, because how it also has the effect of decreasing Special Attack. However, basiclly, the more powerful the move, the more EVs gained.
The Max EV count would probably have to increase from 500 so, probably should be around 1000 or even 2000.

1362069919.0	19eiyn	Problem and Possible Solution?		2	1	0	"Just lurking, I have found that many prospective Melanites (Melaniters? Gamers? Users?) have a large distaste for the HM system, especially when it pertains to the water-based HMs. This is a serious problem which needs a serious discussion. The modification in the HM system could bring in a great number of innovation and further cutting-edge developments. 

I just want to know if there is a possibility in a change of the HM/Environment progression system, or not. Also, I'd like to spark the discussion of possible solutions or tweaks to the system (personally, I liked the ""vine-climb"" idea that u/Tiki_Lamp had since there have never been any grass-type HMs).

Please give feedback! Thanks"	t5_2uc2m	True

1361424120.0	18xrzn	A suggestion in the system of EVs (If you're willing)	Luckcu13	2	1	0	"I was thinking, what if the EV system was set up differently, to be more like what we see in the anime. (Ash usually trains his Pokemon's moves, without the use of abusing wild Pokemon) Here it goes.


The EV system I'm thinking of isn't about how many wild Pokemon you beat up. It's now about the moves that you use. Each time you use a move, your Pokemon will have one or more EV points to gain when you defeat the Pokemon. The moves you use will cause which EV point you gain from fighting the wild Pokemon. For example, Quick Attack/Extremespeed increases speed, and Flamethrower/Ember/Water Gun will increase Special Attack, and Tackle/Bite increases Physical Attack. Defensive moves, besides giving a temporary boost, will also increase your base Defense stat after the battle. Same with Special Defense moves, and so on. Defense can also increase by the sort of attack you receive, but I'm sure that would end up making the perfect Pokemon harder. Natures can affect how easily it is to EV train a specific area, but it doesn't have an effect on base stats to a Pokemon. For example, a Pokemon with Mild nature will increase the EVs gained in Special Attack by 1.5, but it would probably multiply the EVs gained in Defense by only 0.7, 0.8, or even 0.5. This makes training harder, but still lets you create the perfect Pokemon, and hopefully not cause tons of Pokemon to stay stuck on a PC.

TMs can help you train your Pokemon in EVs by giving them the moves necessary. Some moves are more effective at EV training then others. For example, Quick Attack gives one EV, while Extremespeed gives three EV points. Overheat only gives one EV point in Special Attack, because how it also has the effect of decreasing Special Attack. However, basiclly, the more powerful the move, the more EVs gained. The Max EV count would probably have to increase from 500 so, probably should be around 1000 or even 2000.

I think that's all I have. How do you think?"	t5_2uc2m	True

1361272250.0	18t9xn	Concerning the starters	FattyScientist	2	1	0	"Have there been discussions about the starters yet?
I think Sneasel, Croagunk and Natu are great in terms of their types, but their stats and moves dont really catch up to usual starters. Croagunk has far lower stats then the other two while natu learns no psychic move to attack with before it evolves. The point these pokemon evolve differ alot as well. Natu already evolves at lvl. 25, Croagunk at lvl.37 and Sneasel needs a Razor Claw.

1361188407.0	18qw1i	2 questions not answered on FAQ	vlntnwbr	2	1	0	"Hello there,
I just stumbled upon the thread on /r/pokemon and was excited about the game the second I saw it. I checked the subreddit, subscribed of course and also the website, now I do have 2 questions, which weren't answered in the FAQ, so let me get started here.

1) It's said the game is downloadable as an .exe file and playable without any emulator. I don't own a functional Windows PC, but a MacBook (don't kill me about it), my question now is, wether the finished project will be playable on Mac also ?

2) Will it be possible to complete the national Pokedex, since there is no trading (this is mostly about the starters) ? I really hope, and if so, will there be any kind of reward upon finishing it ? Maybe a starter to be chosen from any other Pokemon game ? Would be very awesome.

I also have a request, could you please put the Pokemon Tyranitar (or Pupitar) be in the game, because it is by far my most favorite Pokemon (also Ralts and its evolutions but I've seen it in the screenshots already).  It would fit into the desert biome very well.

And last but not least, since I am German, I could help you translate this game, if it is possible to release it multilingual, it would be no problem for me to play it in english, but my little brother and some of his friends are huge pokemon fans as well, but aren't able to speak english that well, to be able and play the game in english.

I am really looking forward to the game (or a beta).

Sincerely,
vlntnwbr"	t5_2uc2m	True
