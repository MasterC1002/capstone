1366555397.0	1csu8q	A note to Microsoft on CISPA.	AnonymousMSUser	139	21	20	"Dear Microsoft,

I am putting this here instead of sending it to your mail servers as this would likely end up as lost words of one person.  Here on Reddit, it may also meet the same fate.  It may be also be too late for this, but here goes:

Fervently oppose CISPA.

You have an opportunity to stand up and be a leader in a fight to protect your users’ privacy from a government that increasingly wants to deny us freedoms.  I pose to your two reasons why you should work to stop it.

1.  We have no champion.  We need someone to rally behind.  Google has not opposed it, Facebook has not opposed it, and many other corporations have not opposed it.  The American people (and the people of the world) respect and love those that champion freedom.  The internet may be a place of hostility towards Microsoft, but we noticed when you said no to SOPA.  We will notice if you say no to CISPA.  The louder you say no, the more we will notice.

2.  Lawmakers might be writing the words the way you want them and you may be willing to make the concessions they want this time, but this is a dangerous road.  If this passes, even if you see it as not a problem for you now, it will set a precedent for chipping away at the freedoms that exist on the Internet.  There will be a next time.  Then there will be a next time.  Then there will be another SOPA that you will want to stop but it will be too late.

I hope this will not fall on deaf ears.  I expect it will.  I have written my Senators and my Congressman.  I now implore you to do something unexpected, something surprising, something noble.  Fight for us.

Sincerely,
An anonymous user of Microsoft products

1370978660.0	1g545f	I'll post this here in hopes that the downvotes down completely kill my self esteem. Regarding the XBOX One used/lent games controversy...	RJBrown113	158	56	269	"I have a PC.  I use Steam.  Steam doesn't let me trade my games to other accounts.  Steam doesn't let me buy used games.  Steam makes me download my games in order to install them to my PC.  Steam offer GREAT indie bundle sales and awesome discounts on AAA games.

Can somebody explain to me how this is different from what Microsoft is trying to offer the community, albeit on a console platform?

I feel like people are reacting too quickly to this news and not thinking about what kind of good it can do.

I mean, how is it that people can absolutely hate Gamestop one minute, and then turn around and bitch about not being able to buy overpriced used games the next?  It makes no sense to me.

1353083200.0	13ay9t	Thoughts on Steven Sinofsky	surilamin	112	34	93	"*I'll try to keep this short as my English is not great (it's my second language), but I felt I had to write something about this.  Context is important, that is to say, it is important to look at history and try to see why things happened, and not repeat the same mistakes again.*

I have seen a lot of coverage about Sinofsky's departure that has been very biased.  It's pretty clear that bloggers and certainly the Technorati did not like Sinofsky at all.  The reason for this is quite simple, he took Microsoft been being too open and transparent to a Microsoft where information is not disseminated so indiscriminately.   Apple has always been this way, so the individuals covering Apple expect this and do not really complain about this.  In fact, being secretive has benefited Apple very much in creating crazy amounts of hype.  To understand why Sinofsky did this, you have to take a look back at Windows Vista when it was code named Longhorn and put things in context and perspective.  

Longhorn was a very ambitious project whose development dates back to 2001, shortly after the release of Windows XP.  Longhorn was originally slated to bring a ton of new features including WinFS, vector graphics, and radical new sidebar to replace the taskbar, and significant changes to the kernel.  It also would bring technologies named ‘Avalon and Indigo’ which eventually ended up as a much different technology called what we now know as Windows Presentation Foundation.  Longhorn was headed up by Jim Allchin who showed off a lot of what was planned for Longhorn at PDC 2003.  People were genuinely excited about what Microsoft was doing at this time, and Microsoft was the dominant technology company at this time too.  What we later found out was the demos showed at PDC 2003 were faked demos and concept videos, and not real code running.  If you look at Microsoft demos today, they always emphasize that this is real code running on a real machine in real time.  As we would find out, Microsoft overpromised and would severely under-deliver.  Over the next two years Jim Allchin would royally fuck up the development of Longhorn.  I remember installing Longhorn Build 4074 in 2004, and knowing that this project was in serious trouble.  In 2004 Microsoft decided to reset the project and essentially start from scratch.  For all intents and purposes it took 2 years to develop Windows Vista and it was released in 2006.  Jim Allchin retired at the end of the development of Vista.  Morale of Microsoft enthusiasts/fanboys was at an all-time low by time Vista was released.  An initially super-ambitious release was now much more mediocre and was plagued with a ton of hardware issues because the driver model was changed.  Vista was an okay product, but it stopped being defended among Microsoft supporters and this led to massive perception problems.  Apple starting to rise around this time too with iPod now gaining serious traction.  Microsoft failed to respond to Vista criticism; marketing has always been a problem at Microsoft.  

Now to Sinfosky.  Sinofsky joined Microsoft in 1989 (the year I was born!) at the age of 23, straight after receiving a Master’s degree in computer science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst.  He rose to power by catching the attention of Bill Gates and becoming a technical assistant.  He was partially responsible for Gates releasing the “Internet Tidal Wave” memo in 1995 (Bing it).  A litter later, Sinofsky threatened to quit if he was not given a desired assignment.  Gates said that he couldn’t imagine Microsoft without Steven. As consolation, Microsoft's leadership at the time put some other products under Sinofsky’s control.  (From sfgate article)  This ultimately led to Sinofsky becoming in charge of Office, starting with Office 2000.  He became known for getting office released office on time, Office 2000, then Office XP, Office 2003, and finally Office 2007.  Interesting to note, Stephen Elop (now CEO of Nokia) oversaw Office after Sinofsky left to take over Windows.  Sinofsky’s first lieutenant Julie-Larson Green rose up with Sinofsky, and was responsible for introducing the ribbon in Office 2007.  Steve and Julie did have a relationship for a little bit, but that’s largely irrelevant.  

So, now Office 2007 has been released, Jim Allchin has retired, and we now have Bill Gates saying he will step down in 2008.  Bill Gates chose Ray Ozzie to be his replacement.  Ray Ozzie proved to be disastrous and had no vision for consumers. Ballmer has been CEO for a couple years now at this time. With Microsoft not wanting the next operating system to take 5 years to be released and clear hole in leadership, Steven Sinofsky stepped up to filled the gap. He was especially valuable because he had a proven track record of getting things done on time.  In addition he had overseen an ambitious version of Office that was just released (Office 2007) which had paid off well.  

In 2008 Sinofsky wrote a memo called Translucency vs. Transparency in a blogpost.  This really got bloggers pissed off.  And we went from a company that poured its heart out about Vista, to a company that basically said nothing about what it was going to do about Windows 7.  Sinfosky choose the philosophy of under-promising and over-delivering.  Sinofsky fired a bunch of people when he took over the Windows division, many who had led to the fuck-up that Vista was.  He also brought a lot of his own people from the Office side into the Windows division.  Sinofsky also eliminated a lot of the middle management.  This led to a lot of more senior executives either leaving Microsoft, or going to either Windows Azure or Windows Entertainment (Xbox) side of the company.  Notably, J Allard and Robbie Bach stepped down in 2010, many said this was related to Sinofsky but this simply is not the case.  Zune failure and a billion dollar right off due to overheating problems with xbox hardware contributed to them leaving. 

Sinofsky ended up delivering a great product with Windows 7 and more importantly it was on time.  He brought a lot of changes to the start menu and how the taskbar works.  Sinofsky continued to rise and gain power within Microsoft as the development of Windows 8.   He and Julie-Larson Green took a serious look at where the world was going, and decided to radically overhaul Windows.  What we now have is Windows 8, which I’m sure all of you have been following.  Sinofsky also made many tough decisions which I think would not have a been made without him.  First, he did not allow a tablet version of the Windows Phone operating system.  Tablet sales have always been a subset of the phone sales.  More iphones sold than ipads, more android phones sold than android tablets, and more blackberrys sold than playbooks.  A very small number of Windows Phones had been sold, an even smaller number of Windows Phone Tablets would have been sold.  I’m sure it would have been a great product, but would ultimately be a waste of resources.  Windows Phone 7/7.5 also decided to go with managed code rather than native code.  In theory, this sounds great and there is a lot of promise to it, but it has not worked out well.  This is part of the reason Windows Phone has failed to attract many mobile developers who write native code applications on iOS.  The windows phone team implemented technologies such as silverlight, .net, xna as their development platform.   Sinofsky decided not to go with these and was ultimately correct.  The Windows Phone team switched over to the full Windows 8 kernel with Windows Phone 8, and you can now write applications in native code.  This was also partially made possible by Sinofsky’s work with porting the kernel to ARM.  Xna is now also gone for game development going forward, and I think this speaks to the speculation that Xbox.vnext will also be based on the Windows 8 kernel.  In fact David Cutler is now on the Xbox team (please read Showstoppers by Gary Pascal).  Sinofsky along with Jule-Larson Green were also very strong supporters of the Microsoft Surface and ensured that it was kept a secret.   

So, now we go to coverage from the Technorati regarding Steven Sinofsky.  I’m a MSFT fanboy, and am generally a fan of Paul Thurrott, Mary-Jo Foley, and many others.  However, they have been absolutely atrocious when it comes to covering Steve Sinofsky.  The hate Sinofsky because he has not openly given them information about Windows 7 and Windows 8 development and decided to keep more things secret.   This last week on Paul Thurrott’s two podcasts he openly admitted he hates Sinofsky because it made it harder for him to write his book.  Sinofsky did not give Thurrott internal builds of Windows 8, so he could write his book more easily.  Thurrott also believes he is entitled to get information from Microsoft because he writes about Microsoft and helps consumers with technical problems.  I am sure many of you remember Thurrott freaking out about Microsoft removing aero glass from Windows even though it was the right decision due to battery life.  Well it now turns out that Thurrott was only angry about it because he was forced to re-take screenshots for his book because now there was no aero.  Microsoft is a private corporation that can do what it wants and Thurrott is not owed anything.  Mary-Jo Foley also said she hates Sinofsky because he had her blacklisted from Microsoft.  Bloggers may be financially better off without Sinofsky because they can get more information and write more blog posts with more access to the company.  Lot of traffic also went to Sinofky’s own blog, instead of other blogs.  The pundits also say Sinofsky was hard to work with an arrogant.  It's clear they've never worked for a corporation.  Well Steve Jobs and Bill Gates were also arrogant, condescending and tough to work with.  Leaders have to make tough decisions and this will always piss some people off.  Other complaints include that he did not embrace Silverlight.  Silverlight was a bastardized version of WPF which was too resource intensive.  It’s dying.  Why embrace something that is dying?  Also the pundits suggest Scott Guthrie would be a great replacement for Sinofsky.  Are you fucking kidding me?  We need a person in charge who will fight for consumers and make radical changes, someone with a vision as Sinofsky had.  

Sinofsky has been nothing but excellent for Microsoft.  He has fought for consumers and made the tough decisions that others would not have.  Sinofsky made the trains run on time. He embraced the Metro design language, borrowing from the Zune team and Windows Phone team. It is quite clear that Sinofsky quit.  I believe he wanted more power or certain decisions to go his way that did not and he ultimately decided to quit.  Ballmer has been great at protecting himself and his position of CEO over the last decade.  I do not think he wanted Sinofsky to gain more power and potentially become CEO down the road. It's telling that he split Sinofsky's position to two women who I think he can easily control.  I think Sinofsky’s influence and legacy on the company will remain even though he is not there anymore.  More things are going to be kept secret until it is the appropriate time to release the information.   Microsoft will also get more and more into hardware.  I believe we will see Sinofsky back a few years from now as CEO of Microsoft.  

Edit: Should also be noted that Thurrott was snubbed for an early SurfaceRT review and has been slamming it ever since.  What a crybaby. 

*Fuck, well I wrote a very long incoherent rambling mess, but I had to get this off my chest.  I’m posting this anyways; even though nobody will probably read this. Lol.*

**tl;dr:** **Steven Sinofsky rocks and was good for Microsoft!  I also believe he quit on his own accord.  Bloggers hate him because they had a direct financial loss due to having less information about the company and ignore the good he did.**

P.S. Love/Hate relationship with Sinofsky and bloggers can be traced way back to 2007 starting with Long Zheng http://www.istartedsomething.com/20071207/director-windows-disclosure/

But in the wake of the rage-tsunami triggered by Google's shuttering of Google Reader, imagine how much goodwill they'd win if they saved it.

I can see it now: on July 1st, right as Google is fucking over its most devoted users the hardest by pulling the rug out from under their most important internet service, Microsoft officially opens a functional clone, offering all the same services in the same interface. This would win tons of goodwill and thousands (millions?) of thankful users, most of them highly influential power users and content creators. It would shine a light not only on Google's failure to serve these users in the blind pursuit of Google+ folly, but raise the question of whether people can ever trust Google with their data when they seem so eager to shut down popular, years-old services.

I pre-ordered the Surface RT and got it October 26th.  Absolutely love the device. However, first few days, pixel died.  Wouldn't get unstuck.  So I call support, and the person says they will send me a box so I can send it back and get it taken care of.  Call 2 weeks later because I see no box, rep says ""no, we don't send a box, you have to send it yourself"".  Great, had someone tell me misinformation.  It happens.  Whatever. So I send it in, the device, charger, and keyboard (as the rep said).

Fastforward, I get it back.  Within 2 weeks, the adhesive holding the screen on the bottom of the device is loosening, causing the screen to malfunction.  Call up support, more or less the same, I send it in right away this time.  Kinda angry that it's the second defective one I've had, but whatever.

Fast forward to today.  I get it back, but my type cover and charger are nowhere to be found.  Great, I have a brick.  Call Microsoft, apparently they ""changed their policy"" so now you only send in the device, not everything.  Well, great.  The employee did not tell me this when I sent it in.  Now it will be 3-5 days for them to contact me back so they can figure out what to do about sending me my things.  THEN they will ship it again, which means another 3-5 days minimum.  Meanwhile, my Surface has spent more time being shipped back and forth than actually in my hands.  

Seriously Microsoft, this is ridiculous.  I love your product, but right now all I have had is 2 defective products, incompetent support teams, and right now, a brick. 

Rant over.  Just.  Angry.

Edit: spelling

**Update:**  So today the other two parts came in (at different times).  I don't understand why they ship everything separately, but I'm glad I have them.  I am also confused as to why no one I talked to told me they were shipped this way.  Instead, they just told me that they changed their policy and I wasn't supposed to send everything in.  I probably jumped the gun a little early, but I was just at the breaking point with the customer support.  

Only problem I have with the device now is that the kickstand is slightly loose (maybe warped), and when it is flat with the device, the right side doesn't sit flush.  It's slightly raised.  I may just take this part into the Microsoft Store and see what they can do.  Thankfully this is over now though (hopefully)."	t5_2qh1b	True

Recently I've become incredibly passionate about Microsoft and its component brands, falling head over heels for the Modern UI design language and becoming excited at the company-wide rebranding under its setting. I started joining the Microsoft-related subreddits. However, I grew dissapointed with what I saw- only the XBOX and Windows Phone subreddits had made any changes to the default design, and they weren't very lively. I'm crossposting this because I have an idea that can combat both these issues- a Microsoft Reddit Network. It would be a direct link in the upper area between /r/microsoft, /r/windows, /r/xbox360, /r/bing and /r/windowsphone.

[Behold, my suggested design, tested on r/xbox360.](http://www.majhost.com/gallery/TTOT/Reddit/metroreddit.png) 

It incorpreates the Modern UI design language into everything. Tiles at  the top serve as a link between the seperate subreddits, clickable to send you to the subreddit you desire in the Microsoft Reddit Network. Minor inspired cues from other Microsoft products pop up here and there- a logo next to the search area resembles the Bing search button, whilst the message notifier is the Outlook symbol (rendered in greyscale to represent lack of messages in my case). Thanks to the XBOX subreddit team for the menu bar, which colourises depending on which subreddit you are in. Everything else should probably also be based off that subreddit. It's here if you want to check it out- /r/xbox360)

The purpouses of the subreddits would step beyond what their names would suggest if this were to occour. Microsoft would remain unchanged, and so would the pair of /r/windows and /r/windowsphone. /r/xbox360 would be the least changed, only also encompassing Microsoft's other media offerings- Kin and Zune as well. /r/bing would, lastly, take Internet Explorer, Skydrive and Outlook/Hotmail under its roof- serving as a hub for MS's internet/web app offerings.

The other designs, along with the materials I used to make them, can be found [here.](http://www.majhost.com/gallery/TTOT/Reddit/msreddit3.png)

I hope I'm not stepping on any moderator's toes for any of these subreddits. If I am, tell me, so I can delete this as required. It would require some initial collaberation so that the designs and spacings are unified between the subreddits, but after that, they could easily just continue as usual.

If I'm not annoying anybody, I'd love to hear your suggestions! I can make any changes people ask for, if required. I can also mess around a bit with HTML if nobody else can take the design on.

Thanks for your time! :]

(Excuse the lack of imgur, it kept on failing to upload at the time of writing.)

Posts from this sub are typically even handed (sometimes skewing pro); however, the only topics I see hit the top 100 in large subs (such as /r/technology) are very negative articles.

My question (or point for discussion): Why? Microsoft has come a **long** way since the evil empire days, and I would guess most of reddit's population weren't even old enough to remember them. Microsoft has been ranked the world's most ethical company two years in a row, consistently won awards for a diverse workplace. It's a top linux contributor, sponsored legislation for gay marriage, been a progressive voice in Washington.

You'd think that reddit would eat these qualities up. You'd think there would be some love for the company that makes the XBOX 360. Well, you'd think.

Your thoughts would be very interesting to me. Please, [discuss]"	t5_2qh1b	True

[Source 1. ""Annoying feature on onenote auto paper size."" ](http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-onenote/annoying-feature-on-onenote-auto-paper-size/1cee3e5e-563b-4c7d-b151-997b7eb422cf?msgId=03d1ca91-2dbf-40d6-b79a-e3330cc46a93)

[Source 2. ""Can I create a page template with A4 width, but infinite length?""](http://msgroups.net/microsoft.public.onenote/can-i-create-a-page-template-with-a4/110847)

One guy came up with the idea of drawing a red line on the auto page. This would help you by letting you use what you write as a guide for the rest of the things you write. But the biggest issue is that the line is not infinite. To make it ""infinite"" yourself artificially increases the length of the document. 

Also, it would not be very hard to add page breaks to auto mode. So why isn't that being done? It wouldn't be so bad if the program automatically added a new page when you reached the end of the old page. But it just keeps writing to nothingness.

**Tons of new features!**

In this update, I've addressed a lot of my initial feedback. Some highlights:

* **You can now view comments in Preview Mode!** The full array of commenting features (like changing sorting) are still only available on the dedicated Article Page, but the basics are now exposed to Preview Mode. Most importantly, this means that self-posts no longer load reddit.com in an iframe in this view (or any).
* **I handle more reddit.com links internally!** This means that when you click on a post in r/bestof, I'll display the content natively, rather than in an iframe. There's still work to be done in this area (notably, links in comments that point to reddit.com), but that'll be addressed later.
* **You can change the color scheme!** Don't like the various blues that I use? Change them!
* **User pages!** You can now view your own user page in the Accounts dropdown, or anyone else's by selecting a link/comment.
* **Quick actions!** I've made it easier to do common actions like upvote, downvote, etc. When you mouseover a story/comment, I'll show a couple links for those sorts of actions, making them one click away. For touch, I've added options to customize the swipe-select and double-tap behavior, so you can, for instance, make the app bar appear on left-swipe, but upvote on right-swipe.
* **The app remember links you've visited!** I'll gray out the title of stories once you've visited them. I also added an appbar command to un-visit a link if you don't want to forget to look at it later. History should roam between computers, but the syncing isn't perfect yet.
* **Performance increases!**. The app performs a lot better on devices like the Surface.
* **Load more comments!** As you scroll, I'll auto-load more comments, and I've added links to load more replies for a specific comment.
* **Fixed the blank-screen-on-launch bug!** I had a terrible bug involving the Store's ""app was installed!"" toast that would put my app in a bad state where it only showed a blank page. I finally tracked down the issue and fixed it. PM me if you're interested in the technical side =)

And this is just a partial list! The full list can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit_to_go/comments/11si5c/change_log/). 

I encourage you all to download it and try it out! Leave feedback if you want anything added/changed. A lot of stuff in this version was the direct result of feedback I've received. And go Pro! if you love the app! No, there still aren't any Pro-specific features. I've been prioritizing features for everyone first. Going Pro! right now lets you show your support, encourage future development, and get in while the price is its cheapest.

Apologies if you don't care, but this was a really big update, enough that I felt it warranted a new post."	t5_2qh1b	True

1351287214.0	1258f6	Still Impressed...	Vaguswarrior	47	7	11	"So the West Edmonton Mall, Edmonton Canada Microsoft Store never recieved their shipment of Surface RTs. So about 80-90 of us lined up at 8:00am-ish for nothing, but MS really did try to accomodate us. Free Coffee, Snacks, and a promise to hand deliver the late arriving tablets to us!  

Not only that but apparently, they hired a pilot in a little tiny Cessna to fly up several boxes of Surfaces right from Redmond in case UPS doesn't deliver in time!  

Despite the disappointment, I'm really grateful for that store's willingness to make a bad situation better. So I'm sitting on reddit, phone next to my hand waiting for a call to give my address to a Microsoft Store employee to deliver my Surface!

Crewcuts	42	6	41	"My normal method for taking notes during lectures is simply opening up a Word Document on my laptop, hammer out my notes and then reorganising them later into a coherent structure and that works for me just fine or alternatively if I am required to illustrate something I will use a pen and paper.

I attempted to use OneNote for taking notes during the last two months of lectures and honestly, I found it no more appealing than the way I had previously been doing it. The draw feature was nice… if I had my mouse with me; attempting to jot anything down with a touchpad was dire. I am sure people may argue that it allows better organisation of notes but… well, that is what folders are for, I currently have a folder for each one of my units and then I have a separate word document for each lecture (each named appropriately) inside accompanied by the PowerPoint if supplied.

I am genuinely interested as to why anyone other than tablet or phone users would use a separate product.

The same media campaign that was against RIM.  There seems to be some obvious bias towards Microsoft in the media that I feel has been unfounded.  They tend to focus on all the negative angles rather than the positive.  Now for RIM, I can understand it, as they were not moving very quickly to get a competitive product to market. However, Microsoft has been innovating and introducing new products that I feel customers would be more willing to try and enjoy it the media did not have such a negative bias against the company.

Ill start with the ones I know.

* ¶ = Windows Key

**¶ + Pause/Break** = System Properties

**¶ + E** = This Computer

**¶ + D** = Go to desktop

**¶ + L** = Lock your computer

**¶ + 1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/0** 
(Each number represents the icon on your taskbar so you can quickly start up the programs that you've attached to it)

**Alt + D** = Go to URL/Location (works in all explorer windows and browsers)

**Ctrl + T** = New tab in a browser

**Ctrl + W** = Close tab in a browser

**Tab** = Descend to the next selection (dur)

**Shift + Tab** = Ascend to the previous selection (also works with *Alt+Tab*)

**Ctrl + Shift + Escape** = Task Manager (thus no more control + alt + del)

__________________________________
In Word and other text editors : 

**Ctrl + E** = Align the text to the center

**Ctrl + L** = Align the text to the left

**Ctrl + R** = Align the text to the right

**Ctrl + B** = Bold text

**Ctrl + I** = Italic/Cursive

___________________________

Not really hotkeys but still:

**¶ + R** = Open Run

There you can enter the following commands :

*calc*  = Calculator

*winword* = Word

*mspaint* = Paint

*msconfig* = System configuration tool (Get rid of all those damn programs that boot along with your windows)

*appwiz.cpl* = Remove/Add programs

*ncpa.cpl* = Network adapter connections

*shutdown -s -t X*

Where **X** represents the ammount of seconds before your PC shuts down.

* You can add files to your music, but not folders. 
* No quick way to remove a song from your music or a playlist
* No way to remove an artist from your music or a playlist
* No way to add an entire artist to your music
* If I have a subscription why is it still asking me to pay for some albums? 
* Why doesn't Smart DJ work for some artists?

I want to like Xbox Music, I really do, but it's just missing too much. "	t5_2qh1b	True

I've been ""championing"" for Microsoft for the last decade, but something about the Surface snapped me out of it. I loved the UI. I loved the design. But everything just felt...disconnected. I had upgraded my desktop to 8 and bought a Lumia 822 to go along side my purchase. Then I realized it...the departments within Microsoft either could care less for one another or there is a huge lack of communication between their departments.

I could list my reasons, but they're just my reasons. But they're all tied together by the fact that the Windows group, the Windows Phone group, the Xbox group, the Skype group, the Office group, and the support groups for each....they're all they're own department and it SHOWS in their products. Nothing felt cohesive. It all felt slapped together.

I used to say ""They'll get it together eventually"", like what I did when WP7 came out and they eventually announced 7.5. But honestly, I'm tired of them making all these terrible choices with how they handle their product.

And what's most upsetting is that all the pieces are there. It's just terrible choices that push them in the wrong direction. 

Maybe I'm over reacting. Maybe I just need to relax. But I hate feeling like Microsoft is just shooting themselves in the foot. It's such a bad time for me too. I recently became a MS Partner and have been actively selling Office 365 and other software solutions from them...but this whole fiasco makes me feel like I'm slowing becoming the ""wrong team"".

I wasn't too keen on reinstalling Office 2010 or the Office 2013 Preview, when Office 2013 has been ~~released~~ RTM'd, but it isn't available for download from the Office 365 account portal (I have an Office 365 Plan E3 subscription including Office Pro Plus).

Searching the Microsoft Office 365 forums revealed that nobody seems to know when Office 2013 would be available to current Office 365 subscribers, including the Microsoft staff.

So I just downloaded a torrent for Office 2013 x86 RTM MSDN and installed it to see what would happen.  I used my Office 365 credentials and it authenticated and activated and everything worked fine, to my surprise.

So now I am using full Office 2013 RTM on Office 365 with no problems at all.

This is my VERY amateur write-up. So don't take anything as fact, just my interpretation.


http://i.imgur.com/KQxEb.png

This is the new home screen (UI referred to as Metro). It's left to right only, not top down. You can use keyboard or touch to pan. For touch, it's natural, but for keyboard, it's odd. Basically, in this view you can only access ""metro"" apps (Metro apps can't run in ""windows"" they're pretty much always maximized. I believe you can view two side by side though if you have a display that supports it. My laptop, sadly does not meet the resolution requirement.. All those little icons you see will launch apps that were written for this view. 

**edit:** clarifying. You can launch any app, metro or traditional here, but only apps specifically written for metro will be supported in this UI. that is to say, I Can't run Paint in Metro view. If I were to access a paint tile, it would jump into desktop mode (VERY cleanly, I should add) and load it automatically.




http://i.imgur.com/BNF3s.png

This is what you see if you swipe from right to left on the home screen (can't figure out if you can do this with a mouse or trackpad yet)

**edit:** There is a horizontal scroll on the bottom, but it's tiny and weird to use with a mouse. I'd much rather just use my keyboard's page up / arrow scrolling unless it was completely cluttered. 

Search will basically replace your ""all programs"", since I don't believe you have that anymore in the traditional taskbar (I'll try to touch on that later)





http://i.imgur.com/IMWkC.png

Clicking on Search provides this view...notice ""Apps"" is selected and I can see all my apps here. I can begin swiping / scrolling (dragging the mouse doesn't seem to work but I'm not sure if my trackpad's all set up correctly, this is by design, or what). 



http://i.imgur.com/yOqeb.png


Clicking on Settings lets me search the computer for settings. In this example, I searched for ""Display""

**edit** don't think you can pin settings to the home screen, which really is a bummer. It would be similar to having widgets / toggle options as live tiles / icons on WP / Android.



http://i.imgur.com/gT5D7.png 

Back to the home screen, I loaded up ""Internet Explorer"". There are two versions of IE, the metro design, then the full blown desktop one...this is metro, and the two are handled separately. The mobile browser experience has little compromise when it comes to page rendering. Granted it has no flash support (just right now, or never? not sure. I keep hearing mobile IE will never support plugins, but not sure if that's founded or not.)



http://i.imgur.com/zsVOt.png

If I swipe from the top down (or bottom up), I see menus pop up as displayed. Note: top down shows both menus, bottom-up only shows the one with the address bar. Below, you see a few icons to the right of the address bar: refresh, pin (lets you rename / pin a ""tile"" to the metro desktop), and a little paper icon that clicking pops up a menu to let you either search the page or open existing page in the full blown desktop IE.



The browser itself is buttery smooth and works fantastically well from what I've seen so far. I'd love it on an actual tablet I think. (minus flash playback, plugins mentioned earlier)



http://i.imgur.com/QZs2a.jpg

On the home screen, there is a desktop icon. Clicking / tapping that takes you to the traditional (and I use the word loosely) windows desktop you know and love. A few things to note. Clicking the Window button or the taskbar takes you back to the Metro desktop by default (clicking it again takes you back to whatever application you were in). I can still use Windows Key + keypress combinations for the tasks you already know, e.g. WK + R = run, D = show desktop, etc...Right clicking the desktop lets me do the typical stuff like change the resolution, wallpaper, arrange icons, etc...that hasn't changed.


A quick note as I write this. Going back and forth between the traditional and metro desktop, I am surprised how quickly I can quickly switch tasks (and focus) without the distraction and clutter I'm used to.

http://i.imgur.com/qyraN.jpg

This screen shows what happens if I move my mouse to the very bottom left corner 

Search pops up the search bar from earlier, but as an overlay on this UI, doesn't go back to metro.
Share depends on app how it works. In this example, I can share a screenshot if I want.
Devices lets me output to different devices, displays, etc...
Settings pops up an overlay on the right of your screen. Quick access panels for wifi, volume, brightness, system notifications, power-off. I think this is standard on any screen of the UI, and app specific options if it supports them. (Very limited because of this version and lack of support.


Clicking the time and those icons by it doesn't seem to do anything, it's view-only.



http://i.imgur.com/ubvUN.png

When you're on a website in the mobile browser and want to access files on your hard drive, you are greeted by a touch-friendly file explorer.

This sample, I went to imgur.com to upload a screenshot. I Went through the steps, but you can see I selected the file, ready to upload it.


http://i.imgur.com/W78RK.png

Basic settings are accessed in metro by clicking the settings icon. Like a tablet, you have a very touch-friendly display. For more advanced options, e.g. user account management, you can switch to the desktop view and access the traditional Windows...windows


For web browsing via touch. single finger swipes navigate a page like on any other touch device. Up / down / left / right pan in the appropriate directions and there's the pinch to zoom.

http://i.imgur.com/5penN.png

To copy text, like on Windows phone, click on a word. These circular icons will pop up and you can drag them to make your selection. Click the circle and it will prompt you to copy / cut / paste, etc...based on the application you're in. Tested it in mobile and desktop IE.

**another update**
You can't close tasks that I can tell in the metro view. You can swipe between them by swiping from the left end of the screen and cycle through one by one, but there's no iOS-like or Windows Phone / WebOS card system to let you choose apps. I assumed they would do something similar to the alt-tab display from traditional windows, so this is surprising. perhaps all that's needed is an app for this though.

You can kill apps though by launching the task manager (I pinned it to my home screen, but it launches in desktop view) and kill the Metro Apps. You will notice metro apps ""suspend"" in the same way phone apps tombstone or pause in the background, but I tested out a podcast and that played in the background so that's good news.

***More random thoughts...***

It's funny, the touch version of the browser has a limit to how far out you can pinch-zoom, but with Ctrl Plus / Minus, you can zoom Out / In to your heart's content. 

What I wonder is from a hardware standpoint, how many buttons will be on the tablet / slate devices. For sure a windows key, I'm guessing some way to access the ctrl-alt-del menu (which is similar to holding down power on your phone - let you shut down, log out, switch users, lock device, access the task manager, and accessibility options)

I saw somewhere in the menu earlier you can update what the window key and volume up does so a bit of customization seems awesome.

What I'm perhaps most curious about is what level of access the metro apps will have to the OS compared to the desktop version. For metro apps you can't do anything akin to the ""right click -&gt; run as admin"" as far as I Can tell, but desktop apps can (even when you launch them from the metro view can)

1353808081.0	13qnn2	Just got the Arc Touch Mouse-	skulledredditor	36	9	10	"-and I'm actually pretty satisfied with it thus far. I was concerned about it not feeling like a normal mouse but it's not nearly as foreign feeling as I was expecting.

I know there might be others out there that had the same concern so I figured I would share my satisfaction with the product. The scroll slider (as opposed to a wheel) even vibrates when I use it, which is entirely configurable, to notify me I'm scrolling and give me that similar feel of using a wheel.

When I was at the store just earlier considering buying it or the same model I've been using for a few years I read up on some reviews on Amazon so I'll tackle a few of the things covered there (and recommend checking out the reviews if you are interested in hearing more feedback). The clicking aka mouse buttons 1 &amp; 2 were said to be 'sticky' according to some and/or unresponsive. I haven't had any issues with this and the mouse buttons certainly feel like any other mouse buttons I've used. However, I was expecting touch so I may be more pleased to be using buttons and therefore slightly biased in a way. Another huge thing that a lot of people were talking about was the transceiver for the mouse. It's a micro-transceiver like you'd see for other mice, but it doesn't have a USB port-of-sorts within the mouse for storage. There's a magnetic part of the mouse that the USB sticks to and I could certainly see that being a problem for some. In my case, the transceiver is small enough I can just leave it plugged into my laptop at nearly all times so I don't need to worry about it. 

**TL;DR** - The mouse does work great, it does a fantastic job to make it feel like a normal mouse even though it's new and unique. I am very pleased with the purchase, which was only about $60."	t5_2qh1b	True

JudgeDan	35	10	22	"I just don't understand Microsoft right now.  I love the new generation of Microsoft products and I try to follow Microsoft news pretty well, but I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why these two things have happened. 

I don't know why Surface was announced so long ago, but we still don't have prices or dates.  I would have thought that news like that would have been ideal for burying another company's good news or hiding MSFT's bad news. So far, I haven't noticed either.

Also, I don't understand why Microsoft hasn't shown all (or even the majority, I would hope) of features found in Windows Phone 8. At the WP8 announcement, they showed eight features, but said there were a plethora of other features that haven't been announced. I was hoping they would share at least most of them by now (especially around the iPhone5 launch, in hopes of deterring some disgruntled Apple fans from auto-upgrading).  

Tl;dr Have I missed the reason why Surface was announced so early and when will we learn more about WP8?"	t5_2qh1b	True

I've come to appreciate how great Vista/7's UAC actually is, when used properly. Yet I still see people constantly talking about how they just turn it off, and citing things like ""it asks me for permission to do *everything!* All I want to do is open my e-mail!! fuck vista!!!"" Granted, Vista has more or less been completely replaced by 7 already and Windows 7's UAC does have some improvements (mainly the ability to control levels of alerts) but I've seen people who are totally blown away by how awesome 7 is *still* turn UAC off immediately after install and to be honest it makes me cry on the inside.

UAC is, and never was, *that* bad. It serves a very important and useful purpose. It only prompts you for permission when you make system changes - ie, anything in the control panel or device manager or otherwise some sort of non-user-specific setting (i'm generalizing). 

UAC's prompts intend to serve as a type of ""sudo"" for Windows. Granted, it is implemented poorly *out of the box* and there is a way to make it feel much less trivial, but UAC *never* pops up when you want to open a jpeg or type a document. It pops up when it needs to prevent unauthorized access to system settings.

Please *stop* with the absurd exaggerrations and unwarranted complaints.

I jumped on the platform. I liked the social part, it was weak, but it worked. Social playlists were weak, but had potential. Then WP8....no more wifi, no more social, lots of syncing problems. I haven't been able to buy songs or play many of my songs due to XBox music pass problems. I'm sick of contacting MS about it, and deleting and re-adding things.

Spotify (and i'm sure similar services) is starting to fill the space Zune occupied. Spotify has great integration with Last.FM, my friends and it has a decent WP8 app and Desktop app. It is becoming everything Zune desktop was and could be. Really bums me out.

While I loved the curated Artist information and looking at what is new in the music sections, Spotify can do almost all of this now, and does it well. I think what sold me was how easy it was to plug in other services like Last.FM and get recommendations in the app iteself instead of using another. Songbird tried to do this a long time ago.

Is anyone else feeling this way? I have a feeling MS has abandoned the platform pretty much. Which is too bad, they just lost a loyal customer with a grandfathered Zune account."	t5_2qh1b	True

Before that I just would like to find out a couple of things:

*  The main reason i want to switch is for playing RTS games on a touch screen, the thought of doing that just seems awesome.

* -&gt;Can windows 8 run older xp games? I only really play a couple new rts games (Starcraft 2, civ 5, the new Sim City when it comes out) which will run fine I'm sure, but the main ones I'm worried about are Empire Earth 2, Age of Empire 3, Homeworld 2, Star Wars Galactica Battlegrounds, Warcraft 3, and Star Trek Armada 2. 

*  Is there a decent all in one that can play games well? I don't know much of anything about graphics cards anymore.

* -&gt;I mainly play older games, the only newish games I play are Starcraft 2, WoW MOP, Diablo 3, Civ 5, and when the new Sim City comes out ill be playing that.

What stands out the most are comments like this:
&gt; I had a similar problem with SkyDrive personal folder where they just deleted the file. I never received a warning or anything about it, one day the file was simply gone. A few months ago I made a copy of the Quicken installation CD and put it in my personal folder because I wanted to install it on my laptop at work which I did, but left the file on SkyDrive. About a week ago I went back into my personal folder to clean it out and make room for some other files and to my surprise the quicken.zip file was gone.

.

&gt; I've read the topic (o yes, I speak Dutch!) and it seems he has uploaded a link to a site that was against the EULA.

.

&gt; See, the thing is that Microsoft touts their service as HIPPA compliant. If a nurse/doctor violates HIPPA, that's grounds for immediate termination. Given that the service is supposed to be that secure, there's no reason why Microsoft should be able to access his private folders.

.

Of course the counter argument goes something like
&gt;Gonna be funny when they finally release the info that it was child porn and all you ""quick to scream privacy"" people were sitting here defending him."	t5_2qh1b	True
1340804099.0	vomq5	"Microsoft's biggest problem: People figuring out how MS ""Abandonware"" works. "	Gimli_The_Dwarf	50	29	46	"I'm a huge fan of Windows Live Writer. It's a desktop blogging client that works pretty well with WordPress and makes it easy to do code formatting, tables, insert pictures, etc. 

And I'm pretty sure it's been wished into the cornfield by Microsoft. I'm not positive, but the signs are there. 

And this is why it's getting harder and harder to get excited about new Microsoft products. Because if something doesn't become a huge hit overnight, or start the cash rolling in, it's either shot in the head directly, or worse - left to wither and die on the vine. 

Microsoft has a disturbing habit of letting applications coast - you can download them, install them, they have active pages, and sometimes questions even get answered in the forums. But there's just this feeling that nobody's actually *working* on it. There's no sense of ""wait until you see what the next version brings!"" Just that sense of impending doom. 

The Zune hardware felt like that for almost a year before the plug was officially pulled. Visio used to have an active networking mapper that stopped being mentioned until it was pulled out of the product. 

I have this haunting suspicion that Windows Media Center's days are numbered. It's been announced as a paid add-on for Windows 8. If it even ships, I'd bet a six-pack of beer it'll be the last release. Which kind of sucks, since I've got Windows Media Center running my whole house's entertainment. 

And Microsoft virtually never open sources products, so when they're done, they're done. No way for a community to pick it up. 

""Nobody ever got fired for recommending Microsoft"" could change pretty quickly when a company gets the rug pulled out from under them. And you know what they say - ""Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice shame on... shame on... ya fool me, can't get fooled again!"" "	t5_2qh1b	True

Quote from the MS download page:

**Overview**
To help our customers become more secure and up-to-date, Microsoft will distribute Windows Internet Explorer 9 as an important update through Automatic Updates for Windows Vista SP2 for x64 and x86, Windows Server 2008 SP2 for x64 and x86, Windows 7 x86 RTM and higher and Windows Server 2008 R2 RTM and higher for x64. This Blocker Toolkit is intended for organizations that would like to block automatic delivery of Internet Explorer 9 to machines in environments where Automatic Updates is enabled. The Blocker Toolkit will not expire.

**Note:**
*For computers running Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2 the Blocker Toolkit prevents the machine from receiving Internet Explorer 9 as an important update via Automatic Updates on the Windows Update and Microsoft Update sites; Internet Explorer 9 will be listed as an optional update.
*The Blocker Toolkit will not prevent users from manually installing Internet Explorer 9 as a Recommended update from the Windows Update or Microsoft Update sites, from the Microsoft Download Center, or from external media.
*Organizations do not need to deploy the Blocker Toolkit in environments managed with an update management solution such as Windows Server Update Services or Systems Management Server 2003. Organizations can use those products to fully manage deployment of updates released through Windows Update and Microsoft Update, including Internet Explorer 9, within their environment.
*Even if you used the Blocker Toolkit to block Internet Explorer 7 or Internet Explorer 8 from being installed as a high-priority or important update, you will still need to use the Internet Explorer 9 version of the Blocker Toolkit to block Internet Explorer 9 from being installed. There are different registry keys used to block or unblock automatic delivery of Internet Explorer 7, Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9.


See the ""Additional Information"" section below for detailed instructions on configuring and deploying the Blocker Toolkit. The same information is also provided in the Help file included in the download.


The logical conclusion would be that by default all users of Vista, 7, Server 2008 and Server 2008 R2 will get IE 9 as automatic update. Does anyone remember if MS pushed out IE 8 for Vista the same way? I don't think they did. "	t5_2qh1b	True

I seriously thought I'd get a ton of run around and basically be SOL.

I just got off the phone with sales support for the Online Microsoft store and, I have to say, I was really shocked at how good the customer service was. The rep was helpful both in refunding the cost of the wrong version, and in getting us a download link for the correct one immediately. It could not have been further from what I expected (in a good way).

1330546359.0	qbrrs	Let's discuss our first impressions of the consumer preview...	formerteenager	24	5	59	"Alright, installed the Windows 8 Consumer Preview about an hour ago and have been tinkering with it ever since.  I would like to note that I was unable to select an install destination;  I had a partition on my drive specially made for this install, however it never gave me the option to install there.  In fact, I assumed (well, more like hoped) that it would install along side my current Windows 7 installation and give me the option which to load at start-up, however that was not the case...it actually upgraded my Windows 7 account.  I'm praying to dear god that I can undo this at some point, because I'm on my work computer.  

I plan on messing around with this quite a bit more, but my initial impression is that they are really sacrificing a lot in order to make one unified OS for tablets and desktop machines.  Applications are missing what should be basic options.  For example, in the mail application I cannot adjust the column size for the mail list and the mail preview.  Also, you can not select a custom background image for your tile menu, you have to select from one of five tacky tribal designs.

Additionally, the applications seem to incredibly over simplified compared to previous versions.  Everything just feels cheap to me...mostly the music app and the people app.  

Like I said, I'll continue messing with it (hell, I have no choice seeing as how it upgraded my setup), but I'm a bit skeptical at this point.

What does everyone else think so far?  Pro's?  Cons?
