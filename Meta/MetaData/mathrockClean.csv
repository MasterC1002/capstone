Lots of verified, genuine details in this forum post (including the album cover):
www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=2948672

Also in the description section of this YouTube video:
www.youtube.com/watch?v=SH0Ktk_Y88M

The new details:

- The album releases on the 22nd of January via Sargent House
- Track list is as follows
 1. Cat Fantastic 
 2. Havoc in the Forum 
 3. Left Aligned (Formerly called ""Mind Your Head"" I think)
 4. In the Branches of Yggdrasil 
 5. I'll Take the Minute Snake 
 6. 2 Birds, 1 Stone and an Empty Stomach 
 7. Nice Riff, Clichard 
 8. Triptych 
 9. Pygmy Polygamy 
 10. A Different Kind of Tall (small) 
 11. +3 Awesomeness Repels Water 
 12. 13.0.0.0.1
- The album is titled ""13.0.0.0.0"" as a reference to the Mayan 2012 end of the world prediction.
- This album cover is an image of the round, stone Mayan calendar.

Some older details:

- Stuart Smith, their former vocalist, left the band in 2011 to start a family. He was replaced by Henry Tremain, formerly of another band called Pennines.
- Their bassist Jamie Cooper also left the band in 2011 to focus on a career in graphic design.
- TTNG is now a trio, with Tim Collis on guitar, Chris Collis on drums, and Henry Tremain on vocals and bass/guitar duties.

An interview with The Math Rock Blog about the new album:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=HGb2yZNbjSY

Also, I know there are a lot of guitarists present here, so if you want to attempt some songs on this new album, you'll probably need what's called a Spider Capo. Essentially, a spider capo is a capo that can be adjusted to hold down individual strings. I know for sure that Cat Fantastic uses one. They're around $30 on eBay. Spider capos are also great for playing the songs Baboon and Lemur instead of using a banjo capo.

Some videos:

Havoc in the Forum:

Left Aligned (Formerly called Mind Your Head):
The bass is a little too loud, and guitar too soft in this recording imo.

You want to share this amazing sensation with as many people as possible, so you cook a banquet, using this wondrous new spice in as many different ways as you can.

You serve the meal to your guests, and sit back, anxiously. Their response is.. not similar to your own. They gag, choke, grab for water, some even vomiting. They then proceed to hurl abuse in your direction, accusing you of feeding them something that isn't even edible.

It would be hard to defend yourself without sounding like you're an elitist. To us, it really does feel like people are missing out on something amazingly beautiful, an aesthetic sensation like no other."	t5_2rqnu	True

1350007352.0	11ceg8	I just started a record label	larryfturds	32	3	24	"So the guys in Loose Lips Sink Ships are some of my good friends.  When they began talking about their next release (and, as it happens, their last) about a year ago I casually threw out the idea of funding it and possibly starting a modest record label.  After a few months the band ultimately decided to take me up on the offer, and they released Bro Grinds: Music To Grind Your Bros To as a split 12"" with Noumenon on Naked Ally Records.  

To make the rest of this long story short, I contacted Matt (formerly of LLSS) and asked if he'd want to team up on the label idea with me, and since that time we have essentially hit the ground running.  The next release will most likely be a 7"" vinyl with 3 songs by one of his current bands, Lifted Bells (http://www.facebook.com/LiftedBells).  We have also been talking about some ideas for a third release and will most likely have something very special in store (details to come upon confirmation).  

Anyway, I just thought I'd mention this as I am very excited about it, as is Matt and you all are most likely the kind of people we could identify with in all of this.  If you're interested at all and have a moment check out our humble bandcamp site here: http://nakedallyrecords.bandcamp.com/

...and look for more great things to come.  I hope some of you like it!

Despite this, they sound like many math rock bands (in terms of drumming style, guitar tuning, etc) and don't get me wrong, they are good bands. I can't really name a few cause those bands are kinda forgotten but after watching this taiwanese band called Elephant Gym (not hating on them, they're really good) on youtube, I just got reminded of this.

So what I'm asking is, is it wrong that I strictly correlate math rock with odd time signatures?

It doesn't have to be genre-specific, but math influence helps a lot. 

Stuff like Maps &amp; Atlases first albums, Tera Melos new stuff, Minus the Bear(Planet of Ice and Menes el Oso), the select few Toe and LITE songs with vocals, Foals, Cinemechanica's first EP, the Cabs, This Town Needs Guns. The instrumentals are great but there's something about those moments with the vocals that's like a drug. I need more. "	t5_2rqnu	True

The idea here is that I got really baked, didn't warm up at all and then pressed record. All improvised, un-edited (I put a sonic maximizer on the master out and panned the OHs to be totally honest) and ready for some guitar, bass, keys, harmonica, bagpipe, glockenspiel, marimba, whatever the hell you play. Just go for it. If you want to make whole tracks around them, please do. If you just want to lay down one part, go for it. Maybe someone else will chip in or maybe I'll add a guitar or bass part.

Its about Math Rock (go figure) and its  various origins, where it all derives from (culturally), the varied styles pending on location, and finally its appeal, etc. Why do you listen to math rock? Is it a byproduct of our short attention span culture, and a bunch of ADD children from the early 90's/late 80's are in their mid-20s now? or do we all just love riffs so much? so tell me. what is it about this extremely strange and convoluted genre that you love?

I do NOT, however, have any appreciation for people who downvote the shit out of people they don't agree with. Official reddiquette states the following:
""If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off topic in a particular community, downvote it.""
This says nothing about disagreeing with someone's opinion. If people think a band or a song are boring OR genius when you don't, is it so hard to try to understand their where they're coming from instead of giving em the old ""fuck you""? Maybe instead of downvoting, think about why you feel how you do and start an argument. Some good, healthy dialogue would really liven this place up. The end.

Any suggestions?	andrewbquiet	18	5	39	"I browse bandcamp all the time searching for bands, but it seems that I can only find happy go lucky, up-beat, jump around, ""let's hike up this mountain and build a shed"" type of music for this genre. While that can be great and all, I am looking for something with more of an ""oh shit, there was already a shed up here, and it's haunted"" type of approach.

I know you are probably thinking ""hey guy, you sound like a perfect candidate for mathcore"" and yes I do love me some protest the hero and whatnot, but I am getting bored with the metal sound. I'm looking for bands with that kind of overall sound and style but with an indie approach and more like jazz tones instead of distortion. I'm not into the noise rock style either.

Bands with a vocalist are always a plus, but I won't turn down good instrumental bands if they have the feel I'm looking for.

Also, I have already looked into Tera Melos and Hella at the urgings of many math rockers. Wasn't really a fan, don't know why."	t5_2rqnu	True

or even older stuff like 'Polvo', ['Thinking Fellers Union Local 282'](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMpsOjWS-xY) or 'The Minutemen' (just a few of of my favorites)

1355928821.0	153zcx	Let's try this again: which band do you think most personifies 'math rock'?	collectallfive	21	9	48	"Apparently I wasn't very clear in my [last attempt to ask this question](http://www.reddit.com/r/mathrock/comments/151vey/what_band_would_you_say_most_personifies_the_math/) and most of the people that responded/upvoted thought I was asking a completely different question. I was asking a totally rhetorical, academic question (the heavier details are below), not a question that expects an answer akin to the way hardcore scene kids at my high school used to talk about how ""yeah, Chiodos is way more hardcore than Underoath"" or whatever.

Given that we have a definition of math rock (it's in the sidebar) and a host of bands that are given the math rock moniker at the time of the genres conception (re: wikipedia ""In the 1990s, a heavier, rhythmically complex style grew out of the broader noise rock scenes active in Chicago and other Midwestern cities, with influential groups also coming from Japan and Southern California."") I think we can make a mental frankenstein of all of these known math rock groups and compare the individual bands to that frankenstein.

As an aside, I also think that math rock has two definitions. There's the genre-specific definition that refers to all bands that *are* math rock and then there's a kind of qualifier that refers to qualities of the band/the band's music that most approximates the math rock genre. In this way I would not call the bulk of TTNGs work math rock in that its aesthetic and sound pulls more from midwest emo but they gain the qualifier due to their compositional techniques. With this same minset Don Caballero becomes just as much post-rock as it is math rock (and I'd argue Don Cab is a landmark band in the math rock genre). See, music genealogy is fun!

Here, though, I'm talking about the genre itself. I see the genre as referring more to an aggressive, guitar-driven version of minimalist composition a la Steve Reich/Phillip Glass with elements of serialists like Bartok and Schoenberg but I'm open to amending this definition given the amount of subgenres math rock has spawned (twinkledaddies, mathcore, mathpop, etc.). With that in mind, might it be more helpful to do the frankenstein treatment? I don't know, so let's figure it out.

So let's be amateur music historians and hash this out because I'm pretty interested both in the outcome and, considering the responses in the last thread, whether we can have a mature, academic argument without it turning into a dick-measuring contest over who 'gets music' more.

**tl;dr: Math rock is obviously a genre (and if not, let's pretend it is for a second). Let's figure out which band exemplifies the qualities of the genre without being dicks about it in the process.**"	t5_2rqnu	True

1328820071.0	pi9vz	Looking for new bands...toe, LITE, anyone?	Phinael	13	1	29	I always try and find new mathy bands, but am always disappointed. I loved Don Cab and stuff but most of the american math bands sound exactly the same nowadays, with the exception of Battles, Cinemechanica, Maps and Atlases, Giraffes? Giraffes!, etc. I'm not really into the Tera Melos/Hella chaotic style, I'm really into bands like LITE and toe, where melody and innovation takes precedence over instrumental skill and chaos. I love other Jap bands like Nenem, Number Girl, downy, Mouse on the Keys, and Mass of the Fermenting Dregs. For some reason they all seem to have this unique quality which is rare nowadays. Other bands I like: 65daysofstatic, Samuel Jackson Five, Grails, Jaga Jazzist. 	t5_2rqnu	True
