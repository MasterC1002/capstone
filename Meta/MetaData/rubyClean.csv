1334948579.0	sk4qq	Freightrain - easy Ruby desktop development	bolthar	174	10	32	"Hello everyone,

This is a little framework of mine that I've built out of a personal need - basically, I wanted to write a desktop app using Ruby and I found it daunting to say the least.

So, I've built Freightrain to take care of all the stuff I really shouldn't care about, like loading interface definitions, cross-toolkit compatibility and the likes.

Now I've been working on it for almost 2 years (on and off of course) and, since I've just fixed it so it loads the newest glade specifications, I thought that I could ask you guys for an evaluation.

There's a little readme on the github page and there are some examples in the /examples folder.

[Link to the github page!](http://github.com/bolthar/freightrain)

WHOA! Thanks for the attention, I thought this was going to be ignored...

How many of you would be interested in a step by step tutorial over the major features? I will build that if there's enough interest."	t5_2qh21	True

“Matsumoto,” the young man said, “why should I learn your foreign Ruby? I am strong in the way of Perl, and I have yet to find a problem it is not flexible enough to solve.”

Matsumoto smiled his kind smile and said, “One does not learn Ruby for oneself. One learns Ruby for others.”

“Ha,” the young man said, “then your way is not for me. I am not the cooperating type. I work on my own projects and my projects alone. No one but me reads my code.”

Matsumoto bowed his head and said, “All hackers cooperate, even you.”

“You are a fool, Matsumoto! Did I not just say I work alone?”

To this Matsumoto said, “Even he who works alone, cooperates with all the men he was and will become.”

Upon hearing this, the young man was enlightened."	t5_2qh21	True

  The Japan based Ruby language is set to become an international standard in 2012 through the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Ruby was already standardized through Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS), and the focus will now be directed towards its recognition in the global community by becoming an official ISO standard. This would be the first time a programming language of Japanese origin would become an ISO standard. The nation of Japan hopes that this will increase its recognition in the primarily western dominated software field.

  Ruby was developed by fellow Yukihiro Matsumoto at the National Applied Communication Laboratory (Matsue city). Features such as the ability to architect high level applications with ease has gained Ruby fast popularity around web development both inside and outside the country.

  The ISO standardization of Ruby is being pushed by the Information-technology Promotion Agency (IPA). Domestically Ruby became a JIS standard (JIS X3017) in March from a proposal by the Ruby Standardization Study Working Group."	t5_2qh21	True

The idea is to improve programming interviews by making applicants fix code with broken unit tests in the browser. Versions of Javascript, Python and Ruby are currently supported.
Please let me know what you think: [Initial Round](http://initialround.com)

Also, I wrote some blog posts [here](http://blog.initialround.com/) to expand on the concept.

Finally, I've been asked by other Ruby devs whether the app supports rspec and other declarative testing frameworks. Right now, sadly not, it's limited to core Ruby, but it's on my feature master list :)

Many thanks to my employer and coworkers at Eastmedia for turning an idea for a joke website - into a joke website.
http://onebigchatroom.com is the product of our two day hackathon.

It is what it says it is - one, boisterously loud, pachinko machine of a chatroom - where you can delete your fellow chatter's messages.

Along the way we got to play with:

    HTML5 audio
    Web Sockets (Faye)
    CSS Animations
    Coffeescript
    The patience of our office's neighbors

It's the Friday before GORUCO.
You deserve a break today.

What this isn't:

  - an example of good programming practices

    I'm not out to build a good and dependable MIDI DSL, I just want to goof around with patterns, sequences and key changes. I've committed many atrocities - patching NilClass with method_missing being only a drop in the bucket. Some of it was taken directly, word for word, from the Necronomicon.
     

  - bug free

    I couldn't wait to translate my first chiptune. I haven't broken it down into small repeated sequences yet, I haven't fully tested all possible interactions yet...


  - a library you would want to include in your project

    (see above)


What this is:

  - commented and documented (with examples)
    
  - fun on a bun

  - Zelda

* We have GitHub, most awesomest *social network* on the internet.
* We have RubyGems, centralized libraries for everything.
* We have JRuby, for those who want to stick in the Java world or do some real threading.
* We have Rails, possibly the best web framework available (django people please don't burry me alive)
* We have RSpec and Cucumber, which make me cry when I have to work with JUnit.
* We have great cloud hosting solutions like Heroku and Engine Yard.
* We have huge number of screencasts and tutorials, especially those high quality ones (Peepcode, Think Vitamin, Railscasts).
* Last but not least, we have Ruby, language which is fun to work with, expressive ... well you know.

The list could go on and on, so I guess you get my point.

I've used most of what I know about ruby to make this game: functions, global variables, arrays, if/else, .include?, booleans, and a couple other random things. I have a feeling that there are major flaws in my code (nested if/else and global variables first among them, I'm sure).

I feel like Pragmatic Programmers is too deep, should I just keep going until I finish it and wait for the ""a-ha!"" moment?


**EDIT ONE:**

Thank you all for your help!

* [Heroku](http://heroku.com) seems like a really valuable way to push your stuff live on the web without worrying about setting up complicated web servers.
* [Ruby on Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/) are pretty good too.

I'm going to set up a simple app and see if I can get it going on Heroku and I'll share it here.

Thank you all again for all your help.

**EDIT TWO:**

Most useful command so far is:
    rails destroy scaffold [scaffold-name]

**EDIT THREE:**

After hours of fighting with pushing something live I've started from scratch using http://railstutorial.org/ and so far it's the best, clearest, most current tutorial I've seen. Thanks again folks, I'll keep you updated. I've got a way to go (setting up the environment is so far what seems to be taking the most time). I'll get there.

THANK YOU ALL AGAIN. Seriously, Reddit rules.

**EDIT FOUR:**

Git branches, [Heroku](http://heroku.com), and [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://railstutorial.org) are so far the best tools I've found. I'm about 1/3 of the way through RoRT and loving it. I'm running everything on 10.04 Ubuntu so if anyone has any questions or issues please PM me.

As of now I work most of the time with sublime text on one window with terminal/powershell on the other and work that way. It works pretty good and I'm not so bad on the command line I would say.

I understand that vim may be very flexible but I could never habituate myself to understand the work flow with the required text shorcut (the only one I got to work with was the :q). 

What I have as understanding and conception of vim is currently: It's a terminal application, which means that unless you work with TMUX you either do some terminal or you code you can't do both. Vim is pluggable and can remap keys (but nothing life changing, is it?).

I must admit also, I'm a fan of the windowed editors (like sublime) in the fact that it's more appealing to the eye, but it's just personal fancy.

Now I'm quite open minded and I'm looking to better understand the tooling and be able to vim up to his potential. So there must be something I'm missing."	t5_2qh21	True

Chingu seems to be trying to add sophistication and common usage patterns on top of Gosu, but has a ways to go. Ray is out there too, and an incredibly un-mantained Rubygame.

None of these gems have the awesome documentation and communities I'm used to seeing around awesome ruby libraries, which is discouraging.

It seems to me that right now Ruby is evolving into a more diverse and functional language, ensuring it can do more than just serve rails apps, and in this renaissance of my favorite language I'd love to see people come out of the woodwork and champion its use as a game engine more.

With [these three core obstacles](http://gafferongames.com/2009/01/11/ruby-is-not-at-all-suitable-for-game-development/) (top google search for 'ruby game engine'!) to ruby game libraries being hurdled thanks to 1.9 and implementations like [rubinius](http://rubini.us), now seems like as good a time as ever.

And, as one lone voice of reason stated in a disparaging discussion of the [light-weight java game library](http://lwjgl.org) about a year before minecraft came out, computers are growing more and more capable, and there's no reason to stick to C++ if other languages are funner to write in.

Are there other obstacles to this becoming a big part of the ruby community I'm missing? I'd love to see more development in this realm, and hear about any experiences other redditors have with current libraries or developing their own."	t5_2qh21	True

This has happened enough where I feel like I should really be getting it by now... and I still dont.

I found this very very VERY awesome tutorial from /r/ruby, and while i see the value behind it, i only 'get' about 10% of it.

I love that he shows you how the functions we use every day and take for granted, how they actually work behind the scenes (how do you program an if statement?). I think this article is purely fascinating I'm just struggling to understand, and how a proc is used (i'm not even taking into account y and z combinators which was way over my head, but that's ok)

Does anyone think they could perhaps explain part of this article (any part really) maybe even 'more for dummies'? I guess it's just the syntax and use of a proc that confuses me. It would be helpful to take one of his examples, and then write out in english sentences what it's actually doing."	t5_2qh21	True

The concept is absolutely brilliant, but there are a few downfalls of it. Specifically I hate how you are forced into using external Amazon services to offer static content. But even more, I hate the pricing.

Before everyone attempts to attack me, **I understand that in the commercial world, Heroku is dirt cheap relative to hiring an engineer to design something that can even compare to Heroku**. I know that Heroku is dirt cheap compared to some of the alternatives. But the tier based pricing still bugs me. Why are we only offered 5mb or 20gb databases? Why are we forced to spend $15/month if we only need 10mb? Why can't pricing be based on a sliding scale, where we pay for what we use?

Being a nerd, I did what any other nerd would do. I rewrote it all from the ground up specifically for the intent of running my websites. It is currently pretty functional, but lacks some of the functionality of Heroku (which will be added before I go full-on public). Over the course of development, a few friends have talked to me about the idea of commercializing it. I am not against the idea, but I'd like to get a broader sense of what the Ruby community wants before I go further with it.

Currently, there are a few differences from Heroku, which I think makes the platform a bit more unique and usable.

* Dynos do not always run. If the routing mesh detects that a site is relatively inactive, it turns off dynos. Both the minimum and maximum dynos can be set. When a dyno is not used, the hourly rate is prorated towards the next month. No more overpaying because your traffic dropped to 100 hits/hr during non-peak hours whilst you had 10 dynos running.
* Static content. When your application is deployed, it grabs static content from a certain folder and serves it directly from the nginx frontends. You can store all of your assets directly, without the costs of going through AWS, and without the speed penalty of having thin serve it.
* Cheaper pricing. I do not want to give hard numbers, but I will be foolish and state the numbers currently being thrown around: dynos as cheap as $5/month (with unused hours prorated), bandwidth at $0.07-$0.10/gb, database is still up for discussion but it will be a sliding scale instead of tier based.
* PHP support! Okay, okay, I know this is a con and not a feature, but I had to do it anyway.


I am very eagerly awaiting **constructive** criticism about the project. If you think it sucks, tell me why. If you think it rocks, tell me why! If you think it should support X or Y feature, well, I would love to hear about X and Y features and why you want them :). "	t5_2qh21	True

By extension, does Padrino have any uptake at all or do folks tend to stick to Sinatra?

I started learning Ruby a few months ago and I bought myself a Microsoft Kinect Cam as an early X-Mas gift. Of course I'm using Linux (yes your OS-X is fine too) and don't even own an X-Box 360 ... so I started the hacking.

After a short time of fiddling with C, I remembered how much it tends to get on my nerves and how much I love Ruby, so I thought ""**Why not write some Kinect stuff with Ruby?!**"". After a bit of googling I found exactly no other projects except

---- [this one](http://openkinect.org/wiki/Ruby_Wrapper#Sample_Code) ----

which was empty and so I decided to **post my first code snippet there**.

Sadly nobody reacted so I have to assume that this project is dead. But what about you? *Anyone interested in bringing some of the Kinect functionality to Ruby?*


**What ~~I~~ we managed to do:**

 * Control the Kinects motor
 * Control the Kinects LED
 * Get accelerometer data

**What is missing (tried but failed):**

 * Get an image from the RGB cam
 * Get an image from the depth cam
 * ~~Get accelerometer data~~



**TL;DR:** Started to develop a pure Ruby Kinect driver. Who wants to help?

PS: I'm not interested in libfreenect wrappers, I want to create a pure Ruby driver. (only with libusb i.e.)

1355340804.0	14qntc	Is it idiomatic to use Arrays where Sets would be proper?	danneu	24	0	28	"I notice that the Ruby community (Rails especially) tends to treat Arrays as Sets instead of just using Sets. It's no surprise considering there's no Set literal notation:

----

    colors = %w[red orange yellow]

vs

    require ""set"" 
    colors = %w[red orange yellow].to_set

----

And you get good enough mileage out of just using `Array#include?`, intersections, unions, `Array#uniq`, etc:

    colors = %w[red orange yellow]
    colors.include?(""green"") #=&gt; false
    colors &amp; %w[red blue violet] #=&gt; [""red""] 
    %w[red orange yellow yellow].uniq #=&gt; [red orange yellow]
    

`Array.include?` is often used as a guard so that arrays have unique elements, anyways.

But to compare arrays, you need to sort them, often carrying around `uniq` baggage to ensure the arrays are de-duped.

    [1, 2, 3].uniq == [1, 2, 3, 3].uniq # true
    [1, 2, 3] == [3, 1, 2] # false
    [1, 2, 3] == [3, 1, 2].sort # true
    [1, 2, 3].to_set == [3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3].to_set # true

----

However, I'd venture to say that the majority of Array usage in the Ruby I see day to day (especially in Rails) should really just be a Set. And if you need ordered sets, Ruby does support OrderedSets.

    require ""set""
    class User
      ROLES = %w[banned member moderator admin].to_set
    end

I don't have much of a background in data structures outside of what I've been exposed to while teaching myself, and maybe I'm overlooking something.

* Are arrays overused compared to sets?
* Is it because of the `require 'set'` and syntactic baggage of sets compared to arrays? Ruby definitely turns the usage of sets into a deliberate process.
* Would Ruby benefit from a literal set notation like `{""red"", ""orange"", ""yellow""}`?

And my primary question:

* Is it generally best to just go with what seems to be the 'convention' of arrays-for-everything? Especially in team projects where nobody uses Sets? Using Sets adds another possibility to method signatures which might just increase overhead and type annotation in team projects. Especially since Sets look like they need intermediate Arrays on construction: `Set.new [1, 2, 3]` and `[1, 2, 3].to_set`.
* Is my assessment wrong? 

One of the reasons this came up is because I was doing a lot of Array comparison for a feature. I've been learning Scala on the side which got me used to thinking about using the right data structure for a particular collection. As I experience other languages/paradigms, I'll definitely start to really parcel out where Ruby simplifies things so I'm undoubtedly just scratching the surface. "	t5_2qh21	True

1351554130.0	12b25u	Benchmark: Ox vs Nokogiri and SAX vs DOM parsing on a 80mb XML doc.	danneu	30	6	6	"You can see my code here: https://gist.github.com/3977120

## Why?

I was trying to parse a 7 GB XML file with the only tool I was used to at that point: Nokogiri DOM traversal. 

...Not gonna happen. After a google search, I came across this [Ox vs Nokogiri speed comparison](http://www.ohler.com/dev/xml_with_ruby/xml_with_ruby.html) which also introduced me to SAX parsing. 

## Task

* Parse an 80mb XML file with 2,600,000 totalnodes (38k parent nodes, 68 nodes per parent) .
* For each user `&lt;row&gt;`, build a `@user` hash out of 3 specific child nodes and then print it to screen.

## Results:

    Ox DOM: 6 seconds (550mb)
    Ox SAX: 6 seconds (12mb)
    Nokogiri DOM: 13 seconds (900mb)
    Nokogiri SAX: 24 seconds (11.8mb)

FWIW: My Ox SAX script parsed the original 7 GB file with 127,500,000 totalnodes in 7min, 49sec. I wasn't even going to try either of the DOM scripts and the Noko SAX script hangs up early on at about the 8,000,000th node despite the CPU staying at 100% until I quit. So there might be a problem with my Noko SAX script.

## Takeaways:

* Walking Ox's DOM tree is manual enough to where you might as well use its less-nebulous SAX API, but I did my best to include it by looking at its tests.
* It's crazy how a 80mb XML structure bloats up to 550mb and 900mb in memory once its parsed into a bunch of Ox::Element and Nokogiri::Element objects.
* It's pretty awesome parsing unlimited XML data with nothing more than 12mb of RAM.
* Ox's SAX API is better than Nokogiri's because Ox's method for extracting the value from a node is nicer. Nokogiri just calls a `characters(string)` method on node contents and it even includes the newlines and tab characters of the XML doc which you have to strip out.
* Noko leans on libxml, Ox rolls its own C extension.
* If you ever really needed to parse a massive XML file and its data could be mapped to a DB in any way, just `COPY` command that shit into Postgres in 10 seconds or something, no joke.

(How to split it into the most sensible objects, how to set up the file hierarchy, etc.)	warpcowboy	26	3	33	"I'm a self-taught programmer that wishes I was majoring in Computer Science rather than Finance because I feel like I lack fundamentals, especially when it comes to making a non-trivial program or gem. I have the confidence to code just about anything I want to, but I quickly lose steam when my code reminds me that I have no real vision of how to design a program. No real ""boilerplate"" to conceptually follow. Rarely more than one or two objects.

Looking at anyone else's code on Github reminds me how simplistic my concept of programming is. Especially when I look at gems that do such simple things. A lot of them are so cleverly set up in ways I would've never natively considered. So, I've been spending time studying well-known programmers' ruby code on Github. But I feel like I'm just trying to sniff out patterns in their commonalities and then guess at the reasoning behind them rather than actually educating myself.

Can anyone recommend any good books/resources that may help, particularly on the issue of how to design a program? I particularly like Ruby books since Ruby's minimal OO syntax makes it even easier to focus on the concepts of program design, but I'm sure the fundamental resources on this kind of stuff are written in other languages."	t5_2qh21	True

A little bit of history first.

I am a 32 year old with no college education. I currently work at a dead end job in a warehouse putting away boxes and making deliveries. I have always loved computers and have been making websites for friends and family for years. I never charged, I just did it for the challenge and to learn something new. About 6 months ago I a friend turned me on to Reddit and shortly after I discovered r/webdev. At the time I was messing around with PHP and Wordpress and had never heard of Ruby or Python. After a few weeks of hanging around on r/webdev I discovered Ruby and the Rails framework. I dived in and have been trying to teach myself Ruby and Rails.

Up until a few months ago I had been a little depressed where my life had ended up. When I found Ruby I thought maybe there might be a chance turn my hobby into a career. Currently I am on my second read through of Eloquent Ruby and have done the the Ruby tutorial. I practice and study every day. I try to come up with small projects to work on to try the new concepts I learn and to heIp me retain the what I read. I have been considering signing up for one of the many Rails dev camps to help accelerate my path into the industry.

My fear is that I'll never be taken seriously when I finally apply for a job. Mainly because I have no programing experience and I don't have a CS degree.

So tell me r/ruby... can I make this a reality? 

I'm not trying to become the next Zuckerberg or create the next Instagram. I just want a career where I love what I do and I have an opportunity to make a small difference in the world.

TLDR; I'm 32 no college eduction and I want to be a Ruby/Rails dev. Do I have a chance? Give it to me straight."	t5_2qh21	True

It wasn't in CS or anything technical.  I returned to college earlier this year to take CS classes and attempt to get a second degree in a more technical field related to computers/programming.

However, I just decided to leave school at the start of fall semester.  Mainly because of health concerns (its a long story).  But, I feel like I could probably teach myself better anyways.  I know it will be a lot of work though.

I was doing some research and ruby is a language that seems to be an upcoming language that a lot of start ups are hiring for.

My plan is to become marketable with the skills I learn in a year or two.  I am getting a full time job soon and plan on devoting my free time to learning ruby.

I have already picked out resources that I will be learning ruby from.

However, one thing that confuses me is what exactly is usually made/done with ruby in the real world?  I have some experience with Java (and a couple months playing around with C).

However, I am not familiar with things made with ruby.  

**Long of the short:**What jobs hire people skilled in ruby?  What is ruby mostly used for in the real world to make?  Also, how is ruby on rails related to ruby (and what can you make with that)?

(Note: talking about what I know, not a language war.) With Python, there are dozens of ways to get things done, but almost always there's one 'Pythonic' way. I now recognize that my code is vastly different now than it was when I first learned Python, because I do things in a more 'Pythonic' way.

Is there a 'Ruby' way similar to the 'Pythonic' way that I can find resources on? I'd like to start writing more Ruby code, but I'd prefer to start with as many good habbits as possible.

So, spoiler alert if you want to go through them yourself. ( https://github.com/JoshCheek/ruby-kickstart.git and the awesome www.ruby-kickstart.com) 

The problem description:

    # My boss wanted to be able to specify what CSS class the body of the HTML output should have,
    # based on which controller method was being accessed.
    # It fell to me to provide a method, which, when invoked, would return a String that could handle the request
    # 
    # There are a few nuances, though.
    # The String you return must be retained during the object's entire life
    # The method must be able to be called multiple times
    # The String you return should know how to add new classes: each class is separated by a space
    # The only method you need to worry about being invoked is the &lt;&lt; method.
    #
    # EXAMPLE:
    #   controller = ApplicationController.new
    #   controller.body_class                 # =&gt; """"
    #   controller.body_class &lt;&lt; 'admin'
    #   controller.body_class                 # =&gt; ""admin""
    #   controller.body_class &lt;&lt; 'category'
    #   controller.body_class                 # =&gt; ""admin category""
    #   controller.body_class &lt;&lt; 'page' &lt;&lt; 'order'
    #   controller.body_class                 # =&gt; ""admin category page order""
    # HINT: 
    #   The concat method will do the same thing as the &lt;&lt; method

And the provided solution (note, this is an exercise on using singleton classes):

    class ApplicationController  
      def body_class    
        unless @body_class
          @body_class = String.new
          class &lt;&lt; @body_class
            def &lt;&lt;(str)
              concat ' ' unless length.zero?
              concat str
            end
          end
        end
        @body_class
      end
    end

Can anyone explain what is going on here? What does ""class &lt;&lt; @instance_variable_name""  do? Why is this definition wrapped in a condition wrapped in a method definition?


How are these addressed by the above?
# The String you return must be retained during the object's entire life (I guess using the @body_class instance variable)
# The method must be able to be called multiple times (I guess redefining the String concat ""&lt;&lt;"" method for this instance variable only... but what exactly is happening? Is the ""&lt;&lt;"" method being attached to the defined ""body_class"" method?

Wow! Thanks guys for so many comments and +ve advises. So I will go ahead and try to opt for the position.

The webapp I'm trying to develop is currently based on sinatra and I'm not sure what the best way to implement secure login feature is. I've found this: http://rubygems.org/gems/sinatra-security project which seems good but it isn't listed on the [official sinatra extensions site](http://www.sinatrarb.com/extensions-wild.html) so I'm not sure if it's legit. 

There is a [sessions](http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro#Using%20Sessions) feature in sinatra but I don't think this is any actual security. This is just maintaining a state. 

I don't need to maintain a state because the app is AJAX based so once a user is on a page all the rest happens in the background. The main concern is how can I securely transfer data between the client and the sinatra app without someone in the middle sniffing the data? And how can I ensure that only authorized users are able to pull data from the sinatra server?

**Edit:** Thanks /r/Ruby! It seems like [Warden](https://github.com/hassox/warden/wiki/overview) is the easiest solution and [this](http://railscasts.com/episodes/250-authentication-from-scratch) is a generally good way to learn about authentication in Ruby."	t5_2qh21	True

I've been programming in Ruby for about 3 years. I am primarily a web developer, but I do things related to bit torrent, data mining, and databases as well. I have a [bit torrent related gem](http://rubygems.org/gems/bencodr) that I wrote for the hell of it. I've also got some projects on [Github](http://github.com/blatyo).

I am looking for ideas for me, but anything you can think of that would be awesome I would like to hear as well."	t5_2qh21	True

1344837166.0	y4r5n	Am I betting the company on Rails?	AdobeHater	32	10	35	"I was recently hired as the ""IT guy"" for a small company that currently has a system built using ColdFusion. The code is very ugly, and barely functioning. My hope is to write a new system based on Ruby on Rails. I have used a ton of other languages, and am probably a high beginner level at Ruby. I know enough about Ruby on Rails to know it would be a great fit for what we're trying to do.

Specifically, our administrative area could be built without much hassle with activerecord. Scaffolding, coffeescript, and ERB/HAML would be insanely useful in getting our pages up quickly. The automated testing would be glorious, as we have nothing like it now. 

I was thinking of going with Heroku for the hosting side of things. But don't really know what other options exist that might work better.

But really, I'm desperate to get rid of our current system. It is barely holding together. It just feels like a huge gamble to move to a platform I have near zero experience with. Our site doesn't do much work itself. Services are provided by our vendor network, so we just need a great way to collect member info, let them change it, bill members, and etc.

I'm in new waters, and its very stressful. I'd be very, very grateful if anyone could provide *any* information about transitioning and even learning rails--although that question has been asked so much I'm pretty sure I've got the resources I'll need.

Thank you, Reddit. I hope you can increase me sanity supply just a tiny bit. "	t5_2qh21	True
