But instead all I end up seeing is people complaining or bitching for lack of a better word about disabling EE and imbalances and blah blah.

Fair enough EE imbalances the game, and i'm not saying you're wrong just don't use it if you don't want to. I agree that without EE it makes for a longer pathway to more advanced tekkit creations and that it's basically creative mode."	t5_2tokf	True

1351535880.0	12aenu	Would there be interest in a RailCraft tutorial?	andrews89	96	12	35	"After posting [this link](http://www.reddit.com/r/tekkit/comments/128ozk/railcraft_doesnt_seem_to_get_much_love_7_car/) it seemed like a lot of people have seen the railcraft stuff but never had the time to sit down and work with it.  Would there be any interest in a series of tutorial videos on how to work with it?  The wiki was incredibly confusing as I was trying to learn it, so I'm just trying to gauge how many people would want a straightforward technical tutorial on how to build fun stuff with rails.

EDIT: Changed to reddit link so people could see comments.

EDIT Again: Alright, I'll be getting together a couple of technical tutorials. Since it seems like most people want more of what can be done with rails and how to do it and not necessarily how things are put together, I'll stick to more technical stuff and less assembly (of components). It'll be at least a day or two as my power isn't very stable thanks to hurricane Sandy, but I'll get on it as soon I feel I'm not going to destroy my computer.

----

Hello /r/tekkit, I have been working on **[this](http://turtlescripts.com/)** and I need beta testers. In a nut shell, I'm creating a site like dev bukkit except for ComputerCraft scripts. I would like to see more CC-LUA activity in the community and figured this might be a way to help make that possible by making it super easy to find content.

Currently, users can:

* Register / Login
* Create / Edit Projects and Files
* Edit LUA Scripts in Browser
* Declare what components are required, such as a Computer with a Monitor, or a Mining Turtle.

In the works:

* Attach a YouTube demonstration! (Rolling out feature tomorrow)
* Voting / Comments
* Search / Sort / Pagination
* User Profile (Show Projects and community ratings, etc)
* Categories
* Beta tag (for scripts that needs feedback/testing)
* Add develoeprs to project
* Wiki Integration
* FAQ with info on how to manage scripts
(for now put them here: mods/ComputerCraft/lua/rom/programs/computer or mods/ComputerCraft/lua/rom/programs/turtle)
* Sub-folder support
* Bukkit plugin to auto-install scripts (OP/Console only/Push-from-web)

There aren't any limits on how many projects or files per project you have. The site will be free of charge and hopefully ad-free forever. Running this isn't going to cost much so I don't need to blast it with crap.

If you are interested in helping out with testing the site or writing some scripts I thank you ahead of time.

I also would appreciate any feedback as I consider this beta.

Thanks again :D

**Edit:** Thanks guys for the support! I'm glad you guys like the idea. I'll try to keep downtime to a minimum since it's still in development. Also, I need to get the voting system going stat!!!"	t5_2tokf	True

1347767809.0	zyhir	"Solar panel factory + how to create a factory for anything easy (Red Power tubes)
"	print_screen	75	12	62	"**Edit: If you don't care about learning how to do this, [here's a picture](http://i.imgur.com/XRC19.jpg) and maybe read the first two paragraphs if you want.**

**Edit 2: [World download. Technic 7.2.6](http://www.mediafire.com/file/1c9pf6vrsjez9e4/solar_panel_factory_fixed.zip)**

**Edit 3: The original world download was bad. I had ""copper"" instead of ""copper ingot"" and it was broken. The link has been updated to fix this.**

I wanted to build a solar panel factory but couldn't find a whole lot of info on how to do so. There are some examples out there but no tutorials, so I decided to try it myself. Once I got going I realized that factories are essentially a lot of the same thing repeated...so I tried to follow that approach. I've created a modular way to create a factory for absolutely anything, no matter how complex.

So here's what I've come up with. [To start, here's a shot of the entire factory](http://i.imgur.com/XRC19.jpg). It looks more complex than it really is...partially because of all the pipes and partially because I've crammed it all in as close as possible. I'll break that down here in a bit. This has a single input chest for raw materials (coal, sand, rubber, copper, tin, redstone, cobblestone, and iron) that automatically feeds to the appropriate module. I use retrievers and retrievulators (not that complex once you understand them) for that. This fits in a 11x15 area and is only 6 blocks high + some wiring underground. I do not guarantee that items will not be created in surplus (if coal is being macerated too quickly, too much could be created. The worst that will happen is the coal dust storage chest fills up and coal stops going to that module).

--------------------------------------------------

Tutorial time:

[Take another look at the first picture. I added some numbers to it.](http://i.imgur.com/p6hMZ.jpg) See how there are really only two distinct things going on?

1. These towers are building things using an automated crafting table (in this example, that's cables, batteries, furnaces, iron furnaces, circuits, generators, and solar panels)
2. These sections are using IC machines to create things (in this example, that's refined iron, glass, and coal dust)

The reason they look different is because automated crafting tables output from the top and input from anywhere else. IC machines output from any side and input from the top.

Ok, let's break things down a little more. [Check out this picture of one of the first towers.](http://i.imgur.com/jStda.png) From the bottom up:

- Retriever. Put things in here that you need for the recipe. Retrievers will request items from the nearest inventory that has it. Make sure you set the retriever to ANY ITEM mode by clicking the little icon on the bottom left of the 3x3 grid. It's complicated to explain, but if you don't do this you'll end up getting stacks of random items in your crafting table otherwise.
- Retrievulator. There's almost no documentation on this, so don't bother looking. On the right side, put the exact same things as you just put in the retriever. The retrievulator exists in order to tell the retriever to stop requesting items when the inventory the retrievulator is connected to has everything you put on that right side. There's complicated reasoning for adding in the retrievulator. I can go into more detail if you want, but basically, if you have two sections of your factory that use the same item, one of them will never get that item unless you make use of a retrievulator. Also, when you place the retrievulator, make sure you are placing by clicking on the bottom of the crafting table (hold shift) or it will be backwards and won't work.
- Crafting table MKII. Build your recipe in the grid...easy enough.
- Filter. There's no configuration for this item. When it gets a redstone pulse it will suck up to a stack of items out of the crafting table.

Some other things to note:

- The mysterious redstone wire on the side: I don't use any timers in my design. The retrievulator constantly (should never stop) sends out a redstone pulse on its own that triggers the retriever. It pulses once per second. I use that pulse to trigger the filter at the top of the stack so I'm always pulling the item out of the crafting table and into the chest.
- The covers on the back of the tower: These are here to make sure the tube doesn't connect from the output chest at the top to any of the machines. I like to use glass panels but I went with white here because they are easier to see.
- The single restriction tube on the output chest: This is a little more complex. I'll explain that later with another diagram.

[Ok, now to the IC machine modules.](http://i.imgur.com/Ros5x.png) They are exactly the same, just configured a little differently because of the input differences I described earlier.

- The retriever/retrievaluator setup is the same. This is a bit simpler since I'm only sending coal to this. My image shows one coal, but you can put more than that in if you want. I would do something like 5. That means when the furnace has less than 5 coal, the retriever will request 5 more. It will never run out and never pull in too much coal in case something else needs it, too. When you place the retrievaluator, jump and place it under your feet, then place the retriever on top or it will be backwards and won't work.
- The redstone wire: Same purpose.
- The output pipe from the filter: This looks a little wonky, I know, but it actually works very well in this configuration when you need to put two of these next to each other like I have. You can obviously make the pipe look however you want.
- There is also a restriction tube on the output chest (hard to see) which I'll explain further on.

[Ok, so now look back at the original graphic.](http://i.imgur.com/XRC19.jpg) See the crafting towers? See the IC sections? Now they make sense, right?

Now that you understand the peices, I'll explain how you can put them together to make anything you want. [Take a look at this top-down view of the solar panel factory.](http://i.imgur.com/e5G9q.jpg) [Ok, how here's a labeled one.](http://i.imgur.com/ADM7O.jpg)

The input chest gets all the raw materials. You can see how the pipe goes from the input to every single module. That way they have access to raw materials if they need them. For that matter, everything in the solar panel factory except that last step on the right is connected. Furnaces can get cobble from the input chest, batteries can get cable from the cable chest (or the input chest if I put them in there). Glass can get sand from the input chest, the solar panel can get generators, circuits, glass, and coal dust from those areas, etc...

The best part is that the whole thing is modular. It would be trivial for me to add the ability for this factory to create solar array's simply by putting the necessary modules on the end and connecting them. Let's say you wanted a Lapotron Crystal factory...you need circuits, lapis, and an energy crystal. [Forgive the crude drawing, but here's the design.](http://i.imgur.com/iwdZf.png) You need 4 crafting module and one machine module. Just make sure you have the input chest connected as shown and there you go! You could even alter the input to be done with EE + collectors if that's what you like. Then you can just turn the thing on, leave it, and come back to tons of whatever you want.

A couple more things:

- Restriction tubes. Put one of these on the output of each chest. Red power tubes work by having items go to the closest inventory that will accept it. That means ANY open chest or a retriever that has that specific item on the list. I think retrievers will get some level of preference over chests if they request an item (maybe), but the restriction tubes on each chest make sure that when an item comes through, it goes to the proper input before ending up at a chest. Restriction tubes act like a tube that is 500 in length, so the chests appear really far away to the items and they only go there as a last resort.
- Regarding the previous note, items will end up in random chests. Since the retrievers pulse once a second, a bunch of iron will get sucked out of the input chest before the first iron gets there. There will be a bunch of iron in the tubes that has nowhere to go. It will end up going into the battery chest (because it's the closest one). That's ok, because next time iron is requested it will come out of the battery chest until that gets used up. You might get 3 or 4 slots of random items in each of those chests, but they won't ever get more than a few per slot so the chest won't get full of crap.
- [Here's a quick screenshot of the power.](http://i.imgur.com/HMpG8.jpg) It's thrown together under everything and is routed up. IC machines get their power, and the retrievers get power as well from bluetricity.

Let me know if you have questions. I spent quite a few hours working this all out and went through many iterations to find a simple, modular design that works for anything. :)"	t5_2tokf	True

NEI is a huge help, but it's still tricky trying to follow the crafting recipes in reverse, especially when you keep realizing you need one more of something.  Hopefully this will help.  (For each step, I have bolded the component you are making, so you can look up the recipe on NEI.

To craft a Nuclear Reactor, you will need:

* 58 Refined Iron Ingots
* 51 Copper Ingots
* 38 Tin Ingots
* 30 Bronze Ingots
* 30 Rubber
* 26 Redstone Dust
* 8 Glowstone Dust
* 8 Lapis Lazuli
* 8 Cobblestone
* 4 Buckets of Water (or other water source)

Steps:

1.	Craft 30 Refined Iron Ingots, 30 Bronze Ingots, and 30 Tin Ingots into 20 **Mixed Metal Ingots** 
2.	Compress 20 Mixed Metal Ingots into 20 **Advanced Alloys**
3.	Craft 15 Copper Ingots and 30 Rubber into 30 **Copper Cables** (you need 25)
4.	Craft 24 Copper Cables, 4 Refined Iron Ingots, and 8 Redstone Dust into 4 **Electronic Circuits**
5.	Craft 4 Electronic Circuits, 16 Redstone Dust, 8 Glowstone Dust, and 8 Lapis Lazuli into 4 **Advanced Circuits**

12.	Extract 4 Water Cells into 4 **Coolant Cells**
13.	Craft 8 Advanced Alloys and 32 Copper Ingots into 8 **Integrated Reactor Plating**
14.	Craft 2 Integrated Reactor Plating, 4 Cooling Cells, 2 Advanced Circuits, and 4 Copper Ingots into 2 **Integrated Heat Dispersers**
15.	Craft 2 Machine Blocks, 2 Integrated Heat Dispersers, 6 Integrated Reactor Plating, and 8 Advanced Alloys into 2 **Reactor Chambers**
16.	Craft 2 Reactor Chambers, Generator, 4 Advanced Alloys, and 2 Advanced Circuits into the **Nuclear Reactor**


To craft each additional Reactor Chamber, you will need:

* 21 Refined Iron Ingots

1364072901.0	1avn1o	Deception in Deception to trap kids in an age.	Whereis404	44	6	23	"Backstory: My friend hosts a Tekkitlite server and for about a month, it was just him and I on there. Eventually we got a few of our friends on as well and the population is at 8 now. 4 of them are my friends including myself and the other 4 are 10 year old kids. The kids can't build anything nice, come into our homes and snoop around and occasionally break a wall down to enter restricted areas. When they do break down a wall to enter a restricted area, they will fill a hole in a stone wall with cobblestone; so very noticeable.

I created an Age for the kids. Full brightness and always day (So they won't whine about going to bed. It gets annoying when they yell BBBEEEEDDDD, with a few extra letters added to that). Basically they could do what ever they like and make what ever they want. I don't care what they do there.

So lets give some names for my friends so you know who is doing what.

* Me: Me
* Admin: The admin
* Russ: Friend
* Spy: Friend of mine who befriended the kids
* Kid A: A kid
* Kids B: A group of 3 kids

Lets start off with the Spy. He is a friend of mine who doesn't go on too often, so the 4 kids never saw him on before. I told him to befriend the kids, because I can't (They think I am evil). So since he befriended the kids, now I have a link to what they are doing. I told him to take screenshots of any misbehaving and Ill post a few.

Kid A: Did a bit of griefing in peoples homes. [This is the admins home](http://imgur.com/a/SPlfq#0) Spy sent me these and I told the admin about it.

Kids B were the first to get trapped in an age. I told my spy to follow them around and see where they go. They went into our area and checked out our homes and snooped around. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/IGxprbt.jpg) and [Here](http://i.imgur.com/eloHxVJ.jpg).
A portal had been set up in a small room where I normally write ages and I told him to get them into the room and into the portal. They were snooping around anyway, so it was a good time to get them in there. I am not terribly sure how he got them to get in, perhaps a few motivational words, but good on him. These three are trapped now :D

Now, we still have to watch out for Kid A, since he is still in the overworld. Luckily, I am on when he gets on, as well as the 3 kids already stuck there. Kids B want to make a nether portal and excape that way (You can't make a nether portal in an age, but they don't know that). They ask Kid A to get some obsidian and this is where I am lucky to be around (My spy wasn't online right now). He goes into our area and breaks into my [buddy Russ's place](http://i.imgur.com/LL4C0QS.png) and [fills a stone wall with cobble](http://i.imgur.com/v7GYcrS.png). I go invis and place the portal right outside the door to the kids world while Kid A checks inside my buddies house. As Kid A comes out, he notices the portal and is hesitant to go through. Everything gets tense and finally, he goes through. YEAH! All of them stuck.

They don't know that they are trapped within the world and they are not getting out. I told them that there was a portal, but you have to follow the quest to get out. Keeps them busy and stops them from asking me to get them out.

Here is the quest story (I feel like a DM)

*You awake on the ground in a mysterious place. The sun looms overhead in an eerie blue sky. You look for some shade, and see a cave in the distance. Something feels odd when you go inside though; it is still bright as day, but there are no torches. You leave the cave and notice the sun hasn't moved at all as though time has stopped. Although you want to leave for the real world, you set up camp as you don't know how long it will be. As you construct your house, you find a small piece of paper under a rock. It is scratched up, but it reads ""An old man may help you escape. He lives in a small cave in a desert"". The back of the paper has a crude map, showing a desert to the north. You gather your supplies and head off in search of the old man. The desert is burning under the sun as you look for the old mans home. You come up to a large cliff and look over, scanning the area. You see something in the distance and run to it. A Ha! You have found the old mans shack. You knock on the door gently. No response. You take a peak in and see that no one is home. All you see is a torch over a desk. A note lays there. ""Hidden treasures and secrets in an abandoned mine. An Oil well in a grassy area flows into the mine."" More searching. Great. (Ill cut to the chase now, and this is also where the kids are in the story. They have been searching an oil well in a desert, which definitely is NOT grassy as the note says. Gets really annoying when they keep asking for help and the help is right in front of them). In the Abandoned mine is a chest, with a note that says ""There are a ton of diamonds in the ground around here"" (There isn't really any note that leads them on the next, but I put another note in the old mans home that says of a village). The village is in a snowy biome. The villagers have a secret church. Befriend the farmer and he will show you the way. The church as a sign on it ""Treasures Below, The redstone points the way"". I set up redstone pointing to a jungle. The forest also has a cross on it as the church does. The Cross also has a sign on it that says ""High"". In the highest tree on the highest branch of the jungle, there is a chest. And this is where the story ends.*

Once they move farther in the quest, Ill add more.

It is nice that they aren't building in the over world though. [Here is something they built](http://i.imgur.com/N4LRvLo.png). I think it is a diving board or what ever. Just glad it isn't in the main world!

Anyway, I am glad my friend was able to spy on the kids and deceive them into thinking that he was their friend, but the real deception is... I am the spy.

The oil fabricator uses 49,600 EU to generate 1 bucket of oil
The refinery uses 25,000 EU to turn that bucket of oil into fuel.

That means, it takes 74,600 EU to generate 1 fuel bucket.
That means, for every fuel bucket used, you are producing over 6 extra buckets of fuel!

Why is it, that I do not see more infinite fuel generation systems like this, with excess fuel used to generate infinite free EU?

If you are to post a video, I think it should be about how craft/make a machine/setup that can benefit to your tekkit/technic world.

1349280646.0	10vpyp	My friend and I have noticed a lack of Tekkit adventure maps. We're fixing that. (x post from r/minecraft)	CommonBanana	45	11	19	"Here's the map in a nutshell:
""Tired of all your magick-y swording and twangity bowing? Feel like you need a break from the monotony of heroic undertakings? Then have we got an adventure for you!
You're a radio DJ at a failing small town station, and you need listeners. Like diabetics need insulin. So, your boss, tired of your lazy bones, decides to spruce things up a bit. What you need is hip, new music, not Grandpa's homemade clay records!
Now, here's the kicker. The only new (to you) music is sealed away by ancient engineers far across the land, and it's up to you! YES, YOU, the radio DJ (and company) to head out and gather them, and save your little population from musical stagnation!
Armed with your pocket lint and whatever weaponry you can scrape from the grocer's and Shannon's sex dungeon, you venture out into the jungle surrounding your hamlet.""

I'll try to do regular updates on its progress, but we're hammering away fairly regularly in between recordings. (Subtle channel plug, hint hint. http://www.youtube.com/user/itslegotalk)

EDIT: Wow, it looks like people really are aching for a Tekkit adventure map. We'll try our hardest not to disappoint. And if we do, you can hunt us down like wild dogs.

1364673084.0	1bbg9a	High stat plants crossbreeding breakthrough!	Crotchfirefly	35	2	8	"If you've ever tried to crossbreed plants with growth of 24+, you know what a pain it can be, since they generate weeds like nobody's business (even if you've weed-exed the target crossbreeding square), and as a result, to crossbreed above a growth of 23 can require some extremely tedious babysitting.  Many people don't even bother trying to get the growth of their plants above 23.

However, I've found that (in the IC2 version corresponding to tekkit lite, at least), the weeds that are spawned from these high growth plants ONLY spawn to the north and west of those plants!

The crossbreeding structure I'd used before looked like this:

OXO

XOX

OXO

where X is a crossbreed square and O is a parent plant square.  With this structure, every crossbreeding spot is at a risk for those high-growth weeds.  HOWEVER, a crossbreeding layout like this:

NNO

NOX

OXN

where N represents some kind of non-crop square (cobblestone, maybe), generates no weeds on the crossbreed squares (assuming you've weed-exed them beforehand)!

I will not lie. I'm really just trying to get word of the server out there. I'm an admin on this server, yet I don't use ""creative"" admin rights, unless I need to fix a grief. That being said.

If anyone's ever watched the Ictonington series on youtube (freakin hilarious), you can tell that their city is extremely well built and designed. The major part that I loved the most was that the buildings were quite close together, almost wall to wall.

This idea of a community like Icton has always been a dream of mine, but with Tekkit, it's easier to put together with shared infrastructure, etc. The amount of stuff you can put together is amazing, and cities and Tekkit are even more so. 

So here's my question. Does anyone want to look past this obvious guise of a server advertisement, join hands, and create one of the best cities... ever?

1360098330.0	17ydtw	In a little while, my flatmate and I are going to try a game I call 'Tekkit: 1945' out for the first time on our LAN server.	Omnamah	33	6	6	"I had the idea last night when we meant to start a serious Tekkit map, but ended up just spawning shit in, including lots of nukes. The (WIP) rules of the game are thus:

The goal of the game is to blow up the other player's nuclear reactor with a nuke, but there are some self-enforced rules since nukes are pretty easy to make:-

1. Build a ceremonial wall to separate your respective areas. They should be pretty near each other though. Near enough so that you can see each other, but not nose at the details.

2. The race is on! Now the players/teams have to build a working nuclear reactor as fast as possible. I'm thinking there should be something that should be produced with the energy from the reactor, that proves it's been made first. Perhaps a certain amount of UU-Matter will need to be produced first. The idea is that the nuclear reactor is a needed component for making a nuke (which, tbh, is how I assumed it worked before I looked at the wiki).

3. The first one to build a nuclear reactor then can build a nuke as quick as possible. Only one nuke at a time though, or it'll obviously just turn into overkill.

4. Then the goal is, with that nuke, to sneak into the other person's base, plant the nuke, and destroy their nuclear reactor, or whatever they've got at that stage.

Not sure how its all going to work, or even if the rules will facilitate good gameplay. I'm thinking that  players will want to shield their reactors when they're building them, so as to protect them as good as possible.

Any thoughts on how this could be improved? At the very least, I thought I'd put it out there so other people can give it a go, or build upon it.

I'd love to see the nuclear reactor become a necessary component for making a nuke. Or maybe a more complicated way of making refined uranium."	t5_2tokf	True

In this adventure, you play as a mediocre, yet mildly successful small town radio DJ. Tired of your lazy bones, your boss informs you that you must embark on a journey to pick up some hip, new tracks! You must journey further than ever expected of a person with your terrible attitude and motivation, and seek out the ""new"" music to save your small town from musical stagnation!

I'm not going to make it an exact voting format, and I'm just going to guess that the top upvoted comment is the most preferred choice, but here's some ""brackets"" to steer you in the right direction.

I want you to explain your opinion about:

- PvP, PvE, Survival, Peaceful?

- EE2 disabled, lotta restrictions, or 100% on?

- Ranks to get higher tier equipment?

- What sort of ""spawn"" should there be? (I.E Player-made shops, public  machines)

- Any other suggestions.

Thank you for reading this, you rock! Don't forget to comment with your opinions on this. An upvote for this would be nice too, since it is a self post and I get more Karma. I want this server to be perfect for you guys! 

EDIT: Ok guys, I think I have a clue of what it's going to be!
It's most likely going to be PvP, with a random spawn into the world within a 7K block radius.
There will be a central spawn at 0,0 with machines, but it's a dangerous trip there.

What I like most is that rewarding feeling of making something that works, to help reach an ultimate goal quicker.

Sometimes the comments provide some useful information but never enough.  The Wiki hardly ever shows how to hook up machines, pipes, filters, and stuff.   It also does a poor job of explaining what the extra slots are in the machines.


I found almost all youtube videos to be useless and very frustrating.  The video links from the wiki are good ... so far.  As for the others, they ramble on, do things wrong and call it a glitch, have annoying mannerisms, admit they don't know how to build what is the subject of the video,  screw up and retry several times, have bad sound, etc.  I bail out of most of them.  Usually while screaming.


If you're gonna post a youtube video:

    Get to the friggin point.  
    Practice first.  
    Know what you are doing and why you are doing it.
    Don't even bother if you have a cold.
    Turn off key clicks.
    Don't waste our time with small talk.
    Don't try to be funny.  You aren't.
    If you screw up edit it out or do it over.
    Keep it short.  Under 10 minutes.
    Keep it to one topic.

ok.  Youtube rant over.

I don't need a video.  I don't want to sit through a long explanation. What I'd love to see are diagrams of how to setup machines.  For instance, a diagram of a cobblestone generator feeding a recycler that feeds a mass fabricator.  Or, how to setup a chest to feed a macerator without loosing items in the pipe (If items sit around too long in pipes they poof).  With each item in the diagram annotated. The annotation should contain the items function, why it's there, why it's hooked up how it is and any other notes. Clearly visible items free of texture packs.  Just BAM you see the diagram you know what to do.  Questions? Refer to the annotations.  The wiki has some pictures but all of them that I found were thumbnails.

Anyway, I'd like to hear how other people learn Tekkit and where they go for reference guides."	t5_2tokf	True

OntShitter	22	0	19	"I know the following example is unrealistic given that UU matter doesn't make uranium (and probably for this reason) but if it did you could make an infinite power/matter system using no EE whatsoever and simply have a reactor make UU that is autocrafted back into uranium for the reactor.

Now the above doesn't work, but I'd like to see how close we can get...

I've made a mobfarm for bonemeal, to grow trees in automated (RP2) farms then burning the wood from said trees in generators... creating UU matter with that, that's about as far as I have gotten in terms of full automation.

Anyone go any further? :)"	t5_2tokf	True

AshleyYakeley	32	8	28	"So I've been playing Tekkit on and off for a few days, mostly making some of the Industrial Craft machines and working with them, which is kind of fun. I also made a couple of BuildCraft quarries. So far so good. Then I checked out EE. I made some nova cataclysms and an alchemy bag and went mining with those, which does generate huge amounts of minerals but that's OK.

But then I made a transmutation tablet, and discovered that the different kinds of resources don't matter any more. At first it was great to be able to find a use for all that nikolite, etc. But now all that matters is ""matter"" and ""fuel"". It's made the game very boring because there's no reason to do anything special to get stuff. I don't need to go to the Nether to get glowstone, or make a farm to get food. I don't need to use the furnace anymore because macerated dust can be turned into ingots more easily on the tablet. When I go mining I don't really care which minerals I gather as long as they have a high EMC value. It's taken much of the fun out of the game."	t5_2tokf	True

However, I am specifically hoping to find a good design for a very high output design of reasonable efficiency. Basically, I want to plug this baby into a mass fabricator and get as much power flowing in as possible without having to constantly spend loads of materials or babysit it.

In summary:

-high energy output

-little ongoing cost (i.e. no single use coolants)

-no babysitting - I don't mind if components have to be shuffled around / reactor paused to cool for a bit and whatnot as long as the process can be successfully and reliably automated with pipes/computers/whatever

-I'm hoping to get energy outputs in the 1024 range or better for less than the cost of a couple hv solar arrays

I maintain (and mostly pay for) a server for our forum group, which is fine, I like doing it, but I feel like it's a bit wasted because people will log in, build 3 or 4 condenser flowers, and then lose interest and never show up again.

When I complained on the forum about the low utilization and fingered EE as a likely culprit, people leaped to rabid defense of EE, and even started showing up on the server again in fits and spurts (I think to prove a point) before petering out again.

Am I right to blame EE? Has this been the experience of other server ops? Could it just be school starting up (many of our players are high school or college aged, I'm probably the senior guy at 35)? I know that if I unilaterally remove EE from the server, people are going to storm out in a huff (which would mean they'd have to come back first in order to storm out, ironically).

How is this handled on other servers? Limiting the rate of condensers seems promising at first but only delays the inevitable. End game in a week instead of 2 days. FFS, I had a 15 year old kid log on this weekend and he had a condenser and a tablet in 2 HOURS.

I really feel as though a server economy is what keeps a community interested and engaged and building. If you have to work for stuff and share resources and labor, you're more likely to keep coming back and helping out. EE just gives everybody everything and you may as well turn on Creative Mode and end the pretense that you're working for stuff.

For people who want a hybrid Creative/Survival mode, I guess it's a good mod, but how do you maintain interest in a server with EE installed? Opening shops is pointless. Towns: pointless. Rail system: Pointless, everybody just flies. Etc.

What I'd like to do is set up a ""hardcore"" world in Multiverse where EE isn't allowed, but merely creating a second world in Multiverse breaks transmutation tablets in all but a random world (for us, usually the last world imported is the only one where the TT works.) And that world isn't even consistent across server restarts, we've found.  Does anybody know of a fix/patch for this? I imagine it can't be THAT complex. Alchemy bags work. Surely it's just a change to how EE manages its data files for tablets? I've shied away from decompiling EE to patch it because I'm not THAT well versed in setting up a proper Java dev environment such that I'd be able to re-compile the thing successfully, and I just don't want to invest days and days in a fruitless pursuit...

1355888374.0	1538pb	Tekkit: Hard Core... plus something more?	Romanulus	21	3	11	"Hi everyone,

/ramble mode

I've played a whole lot of Minecraft vanilla, along with plenty of Tekkit on a server I've run in the past. A group of my friends played for some time, then went on to other games.

Recently, a new mod rekindled our interest for MC: Better Than Wolves (namely with hardcore settings turned on). Wihin, you've got to work very hard on staying alive (not starving), thus things like farming is very difficult as liquids don't have 'source blocks' (which is awesome in my opinion). Things such as windmills can be constructed to power machinery, like a mill (for flour to bake bread), or powered screws to pump water to a higher level (for aqueducts), traps could also be made and set (even trip lasers).

Unfortunately, this mod is incompatible with much else out there and it's missing an awesome feature which Tekkit had: PIPES (among others)! Oh lord, glorious pipes... and that's why we've come back to Tekkit; there's no turning back.  
 
**But we want more, damn it.**
  

Maybe there are some Tekkit mods out there (new or one's we haven't seen) that can do **some of the things we're hoping for**:

* No moving of source blocks allowed (fixing buckets... yes, I see that as a bug).
* Harder to self-sustain (this will come somewhat naturally from not moving water sources)... food nourishes less, too.
* No overpowered items (this can already be edited/modded out): Nano armour, mining lazer, jetpack, etc.
* Remove all matter-creation abilities (scrap/UU matter), etc.
* Much harder mobs: Stronger mobs, more mobs. (Is there a mod that makes mobs target light sources perhaps, too? Doubtful, but I can dream) Tougher mobs will force players to band together.
* Torches that fizzle out after a while or get rained on (this will make the starting a lot harder, too). Unfortunately torches outside of the chunk will stay lit, though.

I would love to hear your input or if you know of mods that would get these jobs finished... otherwise, it might be time to start rolling our own.  
Many thanks in advance!

My quarry was using 3 steam engines powered by coal or lava buckets until I had enough materials for solar. I was working in my base throughout the night. At dawn, I need to refuel my quarry. 

As soon as I opened the door, BOOM! Creeper was waiting for me. I barely survived and the blast was only strong enough to destroy my front door. Phew - that was close. I run to refuel my quarry, grab some rubber and head back to base to fix my door.

I get inside, quickly turn to replace the ground and door, BOOM! Creeper #2 made it inside and was waiting for me. He blew up behind me within range of all my machinery.

Everything blown up, not even machine blocks remained.

VoltZ and or the UE pack from the Technic launcher or FTB launcher is well... definately going places, and will no doubt be one of the big mod packs eventually. At the moment though its way too early in developement. 

Technics come and gone, its fine and fun, but outdated, even the newer version just feels empty

But Tekkit i have to say, its here to stay. No better modpack for a group of friends or an entire community or just a single player industrialising their minecraft world with the bastions of industry, maybe with a touch of magic. Not clogged to the brim with so many mods that you need a second monitor holding up a wiki everytime you play but enough to take you out of the blandness of vanilla.

Our idea was that players would be able to spec their characters such that they were skilled in one area, at the expense of another.

For example, all players might be able to build a basic machine setup, but only by investing in something like ""Advanced Electrician"" do they gain the ability to craft/place wiring more advanced than insulated copper.

Another example could be with weapons. Perhaps all players can craft and use stone, all players can use iron, but not craft, and players who specialize in weapons can craft iron, and craft and use diamond etc.

I could imagine how it would all sort of work with permissions, I was just wondering if it's been done.

I'm ChunkeeMunkee3001, and I'd like to share a little something that I've been working on - my **Tekkit Starliner**!

This Let's Build series covers the creation of the finest passenger vessel ever to sail the galaxy! Essentially a luxury cruise liner in space, the Starliner is being built by myself and Marc, my Chief of Engineering, on my Tekkit Classic server.

The goal is to build a fully equipped liner, complete with:

* Passenger cabins in three classes
* Shopping concourse
* Hangar bay
* Full computer system, providing email, ship news, banking etc
* Engineering bay with power generation and distribution (all ship lighting requires IC2 power)
* A top deck swimming pool!
And much more besides...

Anyways, new weekly challenge!

This weekly challenge is an airship.
Here are the required materials for this airship.

* It has to go in all six directions (Forwards, backward, left, right, up and down)

* It needs to have more than one room

* It needs to do more than just fly

* You need to be able to sleep on it

*  It must be automatic, you cannot just press a button every time you want it to move.

* And you can work as a team on this one!

The top 5 winners will get one month of reddit gold. Just post the link to the reddit post on /r/tekkit as a comment, do **not** post it as a reply to others.
Theese comments will be sorted randomly each page load.
To vote simply up or down vote as usual, your votes will be hidden until the contest is over.
The op of the winning posts will get messaged by the end of the month.
Please only post entries as top level comments, Put any discussion about the contest here: http://www.reddit.com/r/tekkit/comments/15au6x/best_of_rtekkit_2012_discussion_thread/


Feel free to reply to nominations to discuss that nomination though.

Closing date: 28th Dec
Here is a reminder of the rules:

1. This must be original work, no copies of  a youtubers build, a video you made yourself is ok.
2. This must be tekkit, Builds that only use vanilla minecraft, although may be impressive, will also be dissalowed, I am sure /r/minecraft will have their own competition.
3. No contraptions that use stuff from extra mods.
4. All submissions should be older then this post, no newer ones sorry.
5. Only one entrance per op will win, so if the same person's build wins twice, they will only get one month, and the 6th rated thread will get gold.
6.  Have fun.

Hey Guys!

Team Delta Pigs is an established gaming community that has recently set up our second tekkit server. There are around 5 active members playing at the moment with plenty of room for anyone else that wants to join us!

**SERVER DETAILS**
-----------------------------------------
**176.31.234.51:25608**
Live map: http://176.31.234.51:8123

~~Brand new world, ready for industry. EU server. Friendly community. EE has been nerfed big time, although condensor chests are still on. Land claiming and protection. If any griefing does occur it can be rolled back and the crims banned.

So far we have made due without any economy plugins, and just trading within ourselves, but a more structured system could be implemented if the server needed it. I am always open to suggestions on changes as this is a community server, not a dictatorship!

General rules:

- Don't be a dick
- Respect other peoples builds and property
- PvP only with people who accept it, or who are asking for it.

**BANNED ITEMS**
----------------------------------------
A few people have asked what items are and aren't allowed on the server. So basically the items from EE that are **allowed** are:

- Alchemical Chests / Bags
- Energy Condensors
- Divining Rods MK1 / MK2
- Covalence Dusts
- Talisman of Repair

Additionally, these items are **banned**:

- All explosives, bar TNT.

**WHY JOIN US?**
----------------------------------------
If you're looking for a friendly community server to play on that encourages teamwork, making friends and above all, having a laugh, then this might just be for you!~~

**HOW TO JOIN**
----------------------------------------
You can either pop on the server and ask an officer to whitelist you or post your IGN here and ill add you to the whitelist, pending MCbans check."	t5_2tokf	True

I was wondering if anybody has played around with using Tekkit with the [Invasion mod.](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/780480-132-invasion-mod-v0110-so-you-think-your-base-is-tough-do-you/)



So has anybody setup a world for this before?

Have any of you played with the Invasion mod before?

I'm wondering if anybody has ideas for making the scenario more challenging?





I am going to be setting up a server for a Lan party at the end of the week using the Invasion mod added to Tekkit. I have designed a Scenario that I am currently setting up for the player to work from. 



Here is the Basic Idea:

EE2 will be completely disabled

There is a chunk of land approximately 300x300 Blocks floating in the void

There is a crashed Space ship full of raw materials (ores, cobble, sand, etc)

There is a Nexus block setup near the crash. (this calls in the monsters once activated)

The players are not allowed to break, or move the nexus block

The players can salvage anything they want to from the ship (including the ship itself)

The players are given 1 hour to build after which the Nexus is activated (on Invasion mode) and they must survive as long as they can

SMP Multiplayer Server [EE enabled!]	ARich98	25	9	182	"Hey People, I've completely revamped my tekkit server to include a few plugins that will help make your experience on the server better. We've added a few fun plugins like WorldGuard, LWC [THAT NOW WORKS WITH TEKKIT CHESTS/MACHINES] and Essentials Economy. If you want to join, read over the rules and post your whitelist application in the comment section Below.

The rules are:

-No griefing, stealing, or harassment of any kind. The chat logs are read daily and if you are caught doing any of the following you will be banned.

-No offensive or racist remarks or skins.

-Do not ask for op or creative, you will be banned. This is just common sense.

-No raiding anyone else's bases, homes, companies, etc. if you want to do that find somewhere else to play.

-No flymodding, hacking, or X-ray textures or mods. We have multiple plugins that easily detect idiots who use these in our server.

-Don't be an ass, show respect for other players and staff.

-try not to let your quarries overflow, this lags the server and ruins yours and others experience. This is ban-able after warning

-do not purposely melt down someone's reactor. And for the people who use reactors, its a good idea to remove the uranium cells when you aren't online.

-Respect staff, don't complain when you've been told of rule breaking or a ban.

Whitelist application:

IGN:

Age:

Have you played on a Tekkit server before? Are you familliar with Tekkit?

Have you read the rules and agree to them?:

Why we should whitelist you:

Please allow us a day or two to review your application. I will reply you have been whitelisted and tell you the server address. Thanks.

And what if it was a tekkit server? I happen to have a world that has the spawn encapsulated in a 350 by 350 box of bedrock, all the way down to the void. I also happen to host a tekkit server. I was just wondering if anybody would be interested in joining in. If all interested parties would comment below, I would be happy to contact you with details. I expect the server to be limited to 20 people, of which two spots have already been filled. If there is more interest, I'm sure we could do the same experiment with equivalent exchange banned, or even a vanilla Minecraft experience. All of this is up to us a group to decide. 

Edit: shit my proofreading skills are terrible in this phone.

However, I was dismayed to find the recipe for reactors has changed. For those that don't yet know:

http://imgur.com/a/DLQ0H

I for one, do not like the change, as it makes nuclear reactors easier to get ahold of- which I don't like. I prefer a challenge, one of the main reasons I play tekkit as opposed to vanilla in the first place.

I opened this thread to hopefully start a discussion, and see if the consensus of tekkit players agree with the change or not.

The problem I have is the amount of bugs, dear lord the bugs...

So we restarted our tekkit server the other day, people wanted to start afresh. In 24 hours I have rendered the server completely useless twice. The first time; I used a filler, which apparently breaks the server entirely. We had to mcedit the filler out and change the item id to 0 so that it couldn't happen again. So all's fine again, then after about 4 hours I made a steam engine powered quarry, the same happens, server down and unplayable.

Now though these bugs are fixable fairly hassle free, it does make gameplay a little more stressfull, wondering if your project will cause a melt down. I hope that feed the beast (when it has redpower updated) will be much less buggy and more enjoyable in the long run"	t5_2tokf	True

This will be voted on by the /r/tekkit community, and the top 5 contraptions will get  a month of reddit gold!.


**There will be a post up later explaining how to enter**, but for now the basic rules so you guys can get stared looking for posts

1. This must be original work, no copies of  a youtubers build.
2. This must be tekkit, Builds that only use vanilla minecraft, although may be impressive, will also be dissalowed, I am sure /r/minecraft will have their own competition.
3. No contraptions that use stuff from extra mods.
4. All submissions should be older then this post, no newer ones sorry.
5.  Have fun.

The idea is that players will be able to use anchors and teleport pipes to pump liquids from the nether or far away oil wells while the player is online, and have all the chunks unload when the player logs out. So that players are happy and admins are happy. 

edit. this would also prevent buildcraft overflow in case a player hasn't figured out insertion/obsidian pipes.

A brief history by IP:

24.188.60.132:250 : I got gem armor, all that jazz, started working on a factory and building up a faction, then it got reset.  Now computercraft, nether ores, DC, dm armor, some dm tools, and auto crafting tables are disabled/not working properly.  This removes the entire point of my tekkit experience.  I have no strategy for progression, and have no desire to sit there and agonizingly craft through several things. Turtles can't mine and I can't pastebin get or put.  I live and work in the CS world IRL, so this is a serious deal breaker.  Additionally as of five minutes ago it was BLASTED with spam about how someone is gay.

69.162.119.202:25565 ok, so pvp is off, DC is not allowed, CC works... fine... but there's at most 4 people on at once.  the server has like 22 slots!  4 people is not active enough for my tastes.

74.63.237.163:25 Ok, DC ok, nothing banned.  there's like 10 ""jr mods"" who are 12 year olds (literally, there was a conversation they had about this) who can mute and tp.  Not a big deal.  I still got my stuff together.  Griefing and going around faction protection was not allowed.  I had a giant emc flower built and started working on programming turtles to build them as well, so I could procedurally create a massive base.  Everything was going great until today, when I guess the admins decided they wanted to not do tekkit.  ""Someone"" showed up with /vanish, /tp permissions and DC'ed EVERYTHING.  

a couple days ago, I tried the quantumcraft server or something.  Post looked nice, rules asked for maturity.  Then I get in server and admin's posting ascii art depicting genitals of various natures, kicking everyone from server because ""xxx likes ballsocks"".  This is the owner too.

**What I'm asking is this: ""Is there a way to find a mature, community oriented server with factions, computercraft, nether ores, most of ee (with few things disabled...just enough to prevent griefing) where I can play with a decently active community?(&gt;10 on per average).""**

I want to play this mod.  I want to build awesome things.  I have plans and ideas that I keep getting started on that are just wasting away.

Help?  Suggest/invite to a server? IGN is pwillxorz.  I don't greif, never been banned, I have a job, live on my own and am a grad student, so there's some hint at my age. I enjoy music and music technology and can program pretty well.

1356509479.0	15gku5	Sorry I keep asking questions but you guys are so damn helpful. Question about Energy Link/Power Teleport Pipes	qbz	14	2	10	"Ok, so I have an energy link connected my MFE with only 2 blocks of gold double insulated cable. I checked, it is connected to the output. I read online that the energy link should be draining power regardless of whether or not it's connected to anything and it's not so I think my problem is something right there before i even get into the more complicated stuff. But, the more complicated stuff is that connected to the energy link is a wooden conductive pipe -&gt; gold conductive pipe -&gt; Power transport pipe. Elsewhere, another power transport pipe is connected to a gold conductive pipe which is connected to a refinery. The refinery is full of oil, but not producing any fuel. As I mentioned earlier, the MFE isnt' even being drained of power. Anyone got any ideas on what I'm doing wrong? 
PS: Thanks for being super helpful these past few days while im learning tekkit. "	t5_2tokf	True

[Shizlanski's submission part #2](http://imgur.com/4ftug,2LtNh#1)

I think that's everyone that I saw! I'm sorry.
I judged off upvote's solely on this one. Although I will put on my own opinion at the end.


NickdFord has ***11*** upvotes.


Killerpet has ***7*** upvotes. (I honestly think he should have one, he was certainly most rube-golbergeesque with it. Although it required human intervention :/ )


Bboymasterz has ***17*** upvotes.


Zarknord has ***19*** upvotes.


Friend_A has ***49*** upvotes!


Panic_more has ***22*** upvotes.


Supraboi95 has ***41*** upvotes.


Jclishman has ***2*** upvotes.


JaharNarishma has ***5*** upvotes.


Dr_appleman has ***3*** upvotes.


Shizlanski has ***3*** upvotes.


So the person with the most upvotes is currently Friend_A!!


In my personal opinion Killerpet should have won, but that's besides the point.


I was expecting just people with an elaborate scrap system and a ton of uu matter making diamonds.


What I saw was this, scrap boxes with the results being filtered, and auto coal chunk compressor and maker system.  This is amazing, this weeks challenge is another factory.  I promise the week after will be extremely large, I might even extend it to two weeks.


Anyways, this weeks challenge is an auto high voltage solar array factory.  If I can get ahold of Friend_A he will help me judge this week, and the winner of this week will help the two of us vote!!


This one you can or cannot use EE
Single or multiplayer.
Finally, you will be judged by me, for the most part, on how quickly it makes solar arrays.


Anyways!! To everyone the best! Also, [pandas!](http://www.thelostogle.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/pandas-drinking.jpg)

Step two, The Lava buckets go to a tank where the lava is piped into a geothermal generator

The emptied buckets get thrown into a something else, maybe a recycler, a condenser for something else, or an incinerator

The purpose if its not obvious is to have an infinite source of lava for a geo thermal generator

First, it's in a pocket dimension created with a Dimensional Door.
http://imgur.com/a/9yqob

I'll walk you through it with these pictures. On the left are three tiers of Combustion Engines, 5 on each tier, driving power into redstone energy conduits. On the left are 15 Magmatic generators, moving power into the same conduits. Both sets meet in the middle at a set of two redstone storage cubes, which function as capacitors for low power time or during refueling or modifications. On top of them of course is a chunk loader from ChickenChunks.

In the second picture you can see a better view of the combustion engines. They are recieving water and fuel from a series of liquiducts. The ducts pass above and below the engines so that they are getting fuel on one side and water on the other. TE's liquiducts make this WAY easier than waterproof pipes, as they will not connect to already full tubes unless you tell them to. This system would be a lot less compact otherwise. By building the pipes in a sort of S shape, I can hit all the engines. The water is supplied through a Liquid Tesseract (which can be seen embedded in the ground) which is linked to a set of 4 Buildcraft pumps in a river near my house. I think this system could run on 3 pumps, but this way there is room for expansion. The rednet cables on the back supply the needed keep-on signal to them and to the liquiducts piping the fuel from the tanks you can see. All of that is controlled from the CC computer (right now with just lua commands, I'll write something eventually) The fuel is being provided by the refinery at the other end of the room. I'll get to that in a sec.

Pic 3 shows the magmatic engines. They are more compact, since they only need 1 liquid. You can see in pic 4 that all their lava comes from a tank fed by another Liquid Tesseract (I love these things) which is easily sent to them by liquiducts.

On the right in pic 4 is yet another Liquid Tesseract (seeing a pattern yet?) which is output for an oil pump. The benefit of this system is that when the oil is gone, I just move the pump and sending Tesseract and there is nothing to do on this side at all. The oil feeds into a refinery through the set of storage tanks. (refineries are slow as crap, I'd build more but after all the delicious Tesseracts I'm kinda out of diamond) Pic 5 is a bird's eye view, with the refiners directly under the cursor. the redwire is there to make the output pipes on both the tanks and the refinery go, and is always on.

Pic6 is just a back view of the output fuel tanks, and how they are connected to the engines. the second tank was kind of a rush job, which I noticed the first filling. I would rearrange this for someone trying to duplicate the system. The main output for power is an Energy Tesseract in the floor, viewable in both pics 5 and 6, between the redstone energy cells and the refinery. There is a side wire which continues to the refinery of course providing it power.

All in all this took me maybe an hour and a half to set up, plus another half hour of tweaks. The combustion engines output 90MJ/t (6 each on fuel, 15 engines) and the magmatics when charged are another 60MJ/t (4 each, x 15) All it requires is for you to do a bit of running around a desert to find an oil geyser, and then some building up of resources.

In total you will need for this setup: 6 Liquid Tesseracts, at least 2 energy ones, depending on your number of outputs, 15 combustion and magmatic engines, though you can scale this obviously, 1-2 energy cells, a chunk loader, 40-50 tanks (all the towers you see are 10 tall), maybe 30 energy conduits, maybe 40-50 liquiducts, maybe 30 rednet wires, a computer, monitor optional, some levers, and a refinery. The combustion engines alone are running a small ME network, the refinery, all the machines in my home (farmer, 2 composters, harvester/fertilizer, 1 of each other Thermal Expansion machine, and my kill-chamber with a Minefactory autospawner and mob grinder where I harvest ender pearls. Oh and two quarries. This setup could use a bit more power to feed the quarries at full, but they still chug along at a good clip.

So, yeah. You can still generate power with the new mods, it just requires a bit more creativity and some massive power farms. You can't power a whole base on one block nuclear plants or HV solar power stations anymore. And while I miss some things from IC2 (Guys! Get a Mining Laser in! Please! A place to recharge power armor faster or in a grid would be great as well! Oh, and a deployer!) it's actually pretty fun.

I love all of the minefactory machines to death, my killchamber can double as a cloning station for whose villagers with good emerald deals as well, I have one living in my pocket dimension right now. Farming is a hundred times easier with the new machines, just load the planter with seeds and moonwalk away.

Speaking of which, my group is getting ready for our first moon push. We are going to be bringing turtles, portable power, and a small ME network to get a lot of resources in compactly. While we explore, the turtles will execute a program to create a glass dome and we can start getting settled.

I'm really enjoying the new Tekkit, actually. All of the mod creators and the Technic team has done a great job. Now we just need to convince the YogsCast to switch over...

1352618926.0	1302th	What in god's name is going on?! Can someone explain this shit to me?	SwitchView	15	3	24	"I could REALLY use some explanation to this. I have searched google and other places, and nothing can explain this to me.

I run a tekkit SMP Server for a group of about 10 of us, and tonight while we were playing, I have no idea what in gods name happened..

It started off with, random water source blocks would just appear, out of nowhere. Sometimes, you could just be standing there, then BAM it would appear. I was up in the sky once, and it looked like water source blocks came flying out of the sky and hit the group and spread water everywhere.

Now water, is not a big deal, easy to fix and easy to clean up. What happened next, is beyond me.

Lava, lava everywhere. It just started appearing, laval source blocks, slowly at first, just like the water, they just appeared in thin air out of nowhere. It started slowly at first, a source block here and there, then it all of a suddenly just started happening everywhere. Soon we had a entire forest on fire with over 5 source lava blocks, then our house caught fire with 5 or 6 source blocks, then they just started appearing all over the landscape randomly, just everywhere.

At this point, I gave all of us OP powers and we just sat there for a good hour cleaning crap up, for it to keep appearing left and right.

As the night dragged on, it started to slow down and then it just stopped. We are now left with half a house, and holes and cobblestone and obsedian everywhere from us trying to contain this mess.

During this whole mess, one of my friends claimed that he say lava source blocks shoot up from the ground and into the air and then the source blocks appeared.

I would REALLY like a explanation as to what is going on. I do not have any extras on the server or anything, just tekkit. The server is whitelisted for just us, and there was no one else that joined, and the server cmd box did nothing this entire time.

So, can someone please tell me what is going on?

After long hours spent in tekkit, I'm finally at a stage where I decided I'd build a nuclear reactor. For some cool design purposes, I built an underwater reinforced glass dome (I'll post pictures, but I want to put the reactor in there first).

I read on the tekkit wiki that 3 layers of reinforced glass can stop a nuclear explosion. Is it true for the reactor as well? So if I build a reactor with 6 reactor chambers, surround it in water, and then surround that in 3 layers of reinforced glass, only leaving one hole at the bottom for the wire to come out, am I safe?

I'm trying to power six blulectric alloy furnaces in a big bank to generate lots of materials for some big wiring projects. This many furnaces requires an outrageous amount of blutricity,which I'm having a lot of trouble generating.

What I've got right now is a large bank of about 100 solar panels feeding  a large number of batboxes, which are all full. Because this is a large setup and my furnaces are right in the middle of my shop floor, I've been trying to send the blutricity to them via blue alloy cables. Unfortunately, the cables don't seem to be sending much amperage at all. They're always around 100 V, but basically no Amperage.

1349993516.0	11c07s	Tekkit Survival Project - Volunteer Testers Requested!	Waarlod	16	5	72	"Hello fellow Tekkit'rs(?)! 

Me and my friends have been hard at work configuring our 24 slot Tekkit server for a unique style of Tekkit play. Our focus is to utilize Tekkit for the advanced functionality it brings to the game while still forcing players to interact on some level and removing zero-cost resource generation from the game. We have created scarcity in valuable Tekkit resource which will in turn force players to conduct trade as well and venture outside of their ""bubble"" to progress further.

Our server will have constant administration as well as plenty of plugins that will ensure that play on our server is fair and that trade, property and storefronts are heavily protected. In addition we will allow players to create their own block/chest/tekkit item protection with access control without the intervention of an administrator.

Our goal is to create a living, breathing and dynamic world where your choices have positive/negative reactions on the world. A place where an economy means something. A place that you can continue to come back to for a new experience every time!

Items that we feel remove the ""adventure"" from the game have been removed and in the future we plan to implement challenges which would allow people to acquire items generated from removed item (such as Dark Matter or Red Matter). Challenges would include pay (in game currency) to play portals for dungeon challenges or unique quests. However, these challenges and quests will result in death if failed... so bring the right equipment!

We also plan on including ""kits"" for new players free of charge (wooden equipment, few pieces of bread). Advanced kits would be available for purchase (in game currency). 

Player owned municipalities would be allowed so that you can sell consumable goods like EU matter or raw power. Prebuild municipalities would also be available in game for purchase (in game currency).

PvP is lawless. There are no rules. Houses can be player protected for griefing. However, if a siege is declared player created protection can be disabled for the purchased amount of time (in game currency).

Chat is not global and spawning is random. You must adventure to find people (or just circumvent the game.. but hey... we cannot control that!).

Mineral consumption is monitored and enforced. Logic is in place to evaluate average mineral yield per player and deviations from the standards are analyzed. To much deviation will result in inability to mine further. Repetitive offence will result in a ban. This mechanic will need to be tweaked as sometimes you just get on a hot streak... but it's a necessary evil to prevent xraying. 

**Important Server Notes**

* Equivalent Exchange Energy Condensers, Energy Relays and Rings have been disabled removed from player creation.
* Mining Lasers and Nukes have been disabled.
* Block breakers CANNOT break cobblestone.
* Nukes have been disabled.
* Creepers WILL still do player damage but will not destroy buildings/terrain.
* You cannot use explosives ABOVE surface level (~63) on the map.

**What do we need from you?**

We are hard at work doing the acceptance testing of all of our systems and are looking for 10 players to come onto our server and give it a whirl. In addition, we are looking for 2 ""griefers"" to come in and try and bring the house down. The server would be available for one weekend (starting at around 5:00PM Pacific) until the following Monday morning. 
If you are interested please reply in this post or PM me!


Apologize for spelling... threw this together pretty quickly!

Thanks,

Waarlod

EDIT: We are just wrapping up the level design. We will test the plugins next week and possibly go live the following Friday, October the 26th. I will PM server info a day before testing. Please PM me back your name so I can whitelist you.

EDIT2: We are out of griefer spots. You are welcome to apply as a player. Players who grief while signed up as a player will be banned. We have agreements with our griefers in place that they will stop a certain grief if caught and all actions of theirs will be excused. My hope is that griefing will be discovered quickly and addressed so when we go live in a few weeks we just banhammer anyone who finds a new exploit."	t5_2tokf	True

You carry a stack of extra MFSUs in inventory, and fly everywhere instead of walking.You've earned creative mode. So what do you do with it?

Think of it as building sandcastles at the beach. Some are content building a simple shape with towers then sitting back and admiring it. Others build huge, ornate sandcastles. Some build entire villages, while there might be the one obsessive player that spends hours building an inverted pyramid balanced on a single grain of sand. Some may compensate with size for what they lack in imagination, but they're building.

My problem is with the people that think the game is about the accumulation of sand. They make a gigantic bedrock-to-sky cube sheathed in DM blocks and vajazzle their name on the side in diamond blocks. Inside they have cobble generators and ee-flowers large enough to lag the whole server. They tromp over the work of others and offer more sand as compensation for the destruction of sandcastles that took hours of effort.

My server The Nuke and Turtle is commencing a map reset tonight and I've decided that some new faces would make a nice addition to what's already a thriving community.

The server community has been around for 4 months now, it's run by myself and two other RL friends, and is funded by our own pockets plus voluntary donations. (With no rewards system)

Our only rule has ever been ""don't be a dick"" and that's worked well for us. So if you fancy joining a friendly, fun, community with no griefing then please come find us over on www.reddit.com/r/thenukeandturtle

Hope to see you there!

I've got a pretty solid handle on IndustrialCraft, up to functioning nuclear reactors (and didn't blow myself to smithereens!), a good handle on BuildCraft, and enough familiarity with EE and ThaumCraft to know that I don't want to continue with them. I'm barely familiar with RedPower, know zilch about Logistics Pipes, and think ComputerCraft is a pretty cool guy who doesn't afraid of anything.

My question is this: which mods are best suited to doing what? BuildCraft's quarries seem to be the best way to pull huge amounts of blocks out of the ground, and IC seems to give the best returns with ore grinding and smelting. But what mod is best suited to sorting ores and routing them through machines? What about storing them all? What about further modular setups to build particular items, like solar array factories, from a store room of materials? Controlling the whole shebang from a central location?

BuildCraft sorting seems clunky, RedPower machines seem inefficient, IC machines are pretty easily blown up with overpowered EU packets. What sort of wisdom can you all share for which mods are most efficient at what?"	t5_2tokf	True

It would be cool to have less resources in the ground (since civilization had already mined most of them) so you are forced to explore ruins of factorys, power stations, mining sites and small towns for usable technology. 

You get the choice of either scavenging what you can to be used at your own base or to repair the systems you find to their former glory with guess work which could result in a secret stash of goodies being revealed or it sets off a devious trap the former occupants rigged up.

For example you find a mfsu and a teliporter in an experimental power station setup. You could just take them if you have a wrench on hand or repair the power station to fill the mfsu. Then you use the teliporter which transports you into an underground reinforced stone bunker with some sweet loot. Or it takes you to a tesla coil room with say a 1 minute countdown readout and a computer asking for a password that you may have seen somewhere before to escape.

I'm hoping to create a very balanced server with EE partially disabled (a lot of the rings, except for rending gale  + energy collectors mk2+mk3, destruction catalyst, pretty much anything that's primary purpose is destroying blocks in EE). Computercraft is also disabled, otherwise everything is available. 

The plan was to create a tiered system of items, so new users couldn't access the higher tiers of EE until they've had time on the server and forums. We'll also be following industrialgamings example and putting users with mcbans on a probationary period. 

And since we want you to work, we'll be creating a currency based on uranium or something, and disable condensing or transmuting of it.

I'm just wondering exactly how satisfactory this would be to you guys (if you were to play on this server)? Of course the server will be 24/7, no lag, grief protection, as is mostly standard these days.

Asides from the standard tekkit mods, I also have setup and configured LWC, Factions, WorldEdit/Guard, Essentials (for things like teleporting), etc.  If anyone comes online and sees anything I could be doing better/differently, I am open to suggestions and feedback.  We have a new subreddit now, so feel free to post in there or PM me directly.

I'm in my 20's, hold a regular job, and am looking for like minded, mature players to build and create with.  My server I have hosted out has a 22 slot capacity with 2gigs of RAM and a dedicated IP address (listed below).

I've played on servers in the past where they ask for donations to be ""promoted"" or have to access to special commands.  I've also played on servers where they randomly shut down the server with no notice, perform small rollbacks with no notice/reason, and even decide one day to start a new world with no notice/reasoning.  It is for these reasons I decided to start my own server from the ground up and see how it takes off.

Anyway, if you are interested, feel free to drop on in, or reply here or PM me if you want more info.  Thanks and hope to see you in game.

1356211087.0	15ao0r	Wish to make a list of Tekkit Tips for you all, can I get some more I may have missed?	Cyber_Duke	10	2	2	"Hey guys, here are some tips for beginners to Tekkit. If you have any more I missed comment them and I'll edit them in (I'll make sure to credit you). Here goes!

* **Compact is good.** The less space you waste the more efficient it tends to run and you have space for other things
* **Power loops are something to avoid.** Instead of short-circuiting like real circuits IRL, they'll generate lag and no one wants that stuff
* **Use volatile sources of energy at your own risk.** When you power your facilities with energy from Nuclear Reactors or Combustion Engines, you need to remember that they require constant maintenance, and that accidents can happen and you're taking the risk for that to occur. It's probably the only reason why I use Geothermal or Solar for anything, they have no way of exploding in your face.
* **Don't overdo it with World Anchors.** They're a big source of lag, and if you go overboard there goes the server. This is the main reason why many servers have World Anchors banned. Another reason why compact is good, if you can fit more into the area loaded by a World Anchor you don't need as many World Anchors placed.
* **Know the limits of your machinery!** Don't power a electric furnace that can only handle 32EU/t with 128EU/t! Wires have limits to how much they can handle, and each individual type has different energy loss rates. It's important to use Power Transformers as well as insulated cables, or else you take the risk of every single machine you have blowing up the moment you connect it to it's power source, and vice versa; you may drain too much power than you make, in which case nothing will work.
* **Plan ahead.** Try not to start a project to make something (For example, an MFSU) without knowing how much of each ingredient you'll need to make it. No one likes almost finishing something to realize you're missing a few ores or ingots. Use the tekkit wiki to your advantage, it helps a lot!
* **Get more out of your mining trips.** If you use an enderpouch and have a enderchest at home, you don't need to make as many trips. The Nether is loaded with Nether Ores, and they're much abundant in the Nether, too. When you macerate these ores, you can get twice as much as normal mining. However, ages of being exposed to the hostile environment of the Nether have left these ores somewhat unstable; sometimes they explode when you mine them, touch them, step on them, or when exposed to fire, other explosions and on rare cases, spontaneously combust when exposed to air. Because of their explosive nature on collision with the player, it is best to watch your step when traversing the nether. 
* **The cheaper your production, the better.** Can't get more simple than this. As **MrBurd** said, use cheap materials like Scaffolds as fuel for machines such as generators, to operate as cost-effective as you possibly can. Also, use alternate recipes to your advantage. You can make glass fiber cable two different ways: With the recipe involving two redstone dusts to craft, you will receive 4 Fiber cables. However, the alternate recipe involving two silver ingots will give you 6 Fiber cables.

Lyinginbedmon	10	1	24	"I'm trying to work out a fuel can-based fuel solution for a large compound, where I'm already turning logs from an automated tree farm into charcoal and then into coal for diamond manufacturing.

My problem then is [this](http://i.imgur.com/mfpQA.png), a fuel can filled with coalfuel cells does produce the most power per unit by far amongst fuel cans, but the raw material of charcoal itself produces far more power.

1350965944.0	11xfwl	Equivalence Exchange Balancing	_TheEagle	12	3	13	"Please forgive my horrible formatting, im sorta new to large posts on reddit

**Acronyms:**

EE=Equivalence Exchange

RM=Red Matter

DM=Dark Matter

**Intro**


Im sort of new to this tekkit reddit, although personally i have played tekkit/technic for a while now. The first thing i have noticed myself, that everyone seems to constantly point out on this reddit is the imbalance of Equivalence exchange.


Personally i love EE, many of the items are cool, or downright useful (condensers, Alch chests, flying rings etc) however i also notice how overpowered EE is, especially in multiplayer with servers constantly up.


So, i have been recently thinking about what needs to be changed to make EE respected and balanced. These are my thoughts, would like to hear your guys thoughts on my ideas or your own.


**-**For starters I see 2 major issues with the mod in general (not specific items). 


**1.** The relative ease of upgrading tiers of items, from diamond-&gt;DM-&gt;RM.

**2.**The imbalance caused when other mods are used in conjunction with it (IC, BC, Redpower etc).
These 2 issues along with the nature of multiplayer servers are the biggest issues.



**My Solutions:**

**1.** Increase the cost of upgrading tiers of machines and materials. For starters, i have to say the cost of dark matter, and red matter are way too low. I would think a change to the recipes of both DM and RM, and an EMC change to go along would help the speed that people make it to MK3 collector arrays with infinite resources. Firstly a change to DM and RM blocks, they should be the same recipe as diamond and gold blocks, 9 RM or 9 DM for a block, only common sense. Along with this change, the recipe for Dm should be changed, instead of Diamond block+8 Aetenalis, it should be like RM currently is, 3 Diamond block + 6 Aetenalis. This change should also be for Red matter, 3 DM blocks+ 6 Aetenalis. Along with this change, a change should also be made to collectors and arrays, Mk1 requires a diamond block, yet MK2 and Mk3  dont. This should once again be changed so instead of just RM or DM, it uses their block counterparts   


**2.**A big issue of EE within tekkit is the fact that as apposed to having it by itself it can be used in conjunction with the other tekkit mods, this changes many things (especially early on). The first, and most obvious thing is to do with industrial craft macerators, as these let u basically double materials for cheap. It allows you early on to increase you EMC output by a very large amount, and similarly macerators and similar machines allow certain materials be created from materials of lesser EMC value. The most obvious one of these is the Blaze powder EMC generator, which can have the output of a MK3 collector array, for a fraction of the EMC cost. The second issue with this is the addition of materials not already in the game, namely nikolite, tungsten , uranuim and gems. These materials are generally not used early on by  any mods, meaning they are predominantly used for EMC. My solution to this, change condensers and transmutation table's to a 3 tier system, with a %EMC loss for each level:

**Lvl1**=40% loss of emc

**Lvl2**=20% loss of emc

**Lvl3**=0% loss of emc


Following in the trend of collectors these should require DM/RM to upgrade. This should force people to make a choice, use all your materials now for reduced output, or wait until you either use those materials properly, or at a higher tier of alchemy.

This is what you need to make an equal to mine: 

 * 23 Blaze Rods 

 * Rotary macerator stuck at 7500 rpm 

 * 5 redstone engines 

 * Pipes (1 gold, 1 distribution). 

Set the distribution pipe to 2 dust into the condenser making new rods, and three into the one you gather diamonds or matter or whatever. This work flawlessly, and nothing stucks, the macerator does not get filled and so on.

1349238041.0	10uxhx	My idea on the use of EE	JoeyChor	20	12	19	"Arguments on EE are arising, and here's what I think:
EE sure is abusive like griefing and unfair gameplay, but it really contributes to the game because everyone is tired of mining a HELL LOT of coal, SMALL amounts of iron, TINY immediately-used diamonds, and fancy gold. Without conversion of 2 coal for a piece of iron, 8 iron for gold, 4 gold for diamond, you could barely go nowhere. If I started a minecraft Let's Play, it would take me 3 times as long as finding all the ores to get started in IC without EE than with EE. And some plugins restrict stuff like the amazed [TekkitRestrict](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/tekkit-restrict/). This is what my opinion on EE is, but as everyone says, everyone has different opinions. Feel free to ask anything to me for more clarification, I'll probably get that at most 1 hour away.

They only were on for a day, abandoning the server after that. I slowly amassed my riches, to the point that I had essentially 'won' Tekkit. Recently, I invited two new friends onto the server (they will be known as George and Bill), and they reached my level of technology at an astonishing pace (props to EE's Energy Collectors). George grew bored of the world that we played in, and he announced today that he was going to blow up his house, and wait for a new world to be made, however long that would take. Unfortunately, Bill thought that George had meant that he was going to destroy the entire server, so Bill more than gladly 'assisted' him, by quickly making many nuclear reactors, and placing them on all of our houses, and filling them with uranium. I had just come back from my most recent dig site to see a nuclear reactor sitting on top of my house. I, for one, had interpreted what George had said properly, and was extremely confused to see a nuclear reactor sitting on the roof of my house. At first, I did not worry, as Bill had made himself known for trolling us on the occasion, and always went way overboard when he did so. Little did I know that the reactor was filled with uranium, and saw my house, all of my work, be removed from existence in just a single frame. He had also placed reactors in many other nearby areas, and many explosions ensued. I had remembered that the most recent time since then that the server had saved was yesterday (the server is all manual save), so I disabled world save, and restarted the server in an attempt to revert all of the destruction. Unfortunately, this did not work, and the world is stuck in this state of destruction forever. TL;DR - Shit got blown up, but was completely preventable.

We've got a very quiet server with maybe 2 or 3 people on at any one time, looking to increase traffic a bit beyond that. It's a small community where PVP is enabled but rarely used (and generally frowned upon unless the participants are all in agreement beforehand.)

We've got a slightly built up spawn area with the beginnings of a long range rail station and a few amenities like fast food restaurants that automatically provide food and drink. We're looking for people to develop the wilderness.

The main world allows EE. There's a second world (Terminus) that can be reached by portal where EE is disabled (your inventory is separate in Terminus, using Multi-Inv). Terminus is a very challenging wild/fantasy world where the landscape is extreme and getting around can be very interesting. Most resources are plentiful, but Iron is hard to come by, making tech valuable.
