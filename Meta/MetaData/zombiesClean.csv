1260429514.0	ad382	Dorm-wide zombie apocalypse simulation - everyone was provided a ruleset, basic weapons, and required to play. Goal was to survive for a week, 10 out of several hundred succeeded.	RawwrBag	784	71	172	"I put on a ""Zombie Week"" program in my Washington State University dorm last spring, which was an RPG/game of tag/social experiment, and won residence hall program of the year.

Infected had to wear a red wristband inside the dorm. One person started as an infected. Dorm rooms were safe. A tag from any infected, and you were infected too. Weapon and item cards, (a few provided in the mail, and others cached around the building) could be used to defend against zombies.

Basically, weapons and items were RPG-style cards that had to be handed to attacking zombies. We had a pretty large selection with some interesting combinations and effects. Pipe wrenches, decoys, propane tanks, etc.

Everyone was ""required"" to play, and even though there were a few people who just became infected and didn't give a shit, there were hundreds of others sprinting up and down the halls at all hours. It seriously sounded like a fucking zombie apocalypse. Three in the morning you'd hear crashing and screaming, and then silence.

Motivation to survive was a Visa cash card for $50 and other prizes such as Left 4 Dead copies and ""The Zombie Survival Guide"". The finale of the event involved fighting your way to the rec room Friday evening for prizes, pizza, and a zombie movie. I swear half the dorm showed up.

Anyway, we had a lot of fun, and I'd be happy to post the ruleset and items if anyone is interested in replicating this (or just taking a look).

**EDIT:** Rules and items. Also a couple of silly pictures. Pizza eating and zombies lying in wait! Not really something that lends itself to being photographed though...

[Awesome plaque thing for winning](http://imgur.com/XpZxf.jpg)

**EDIT 2:** If you were wondering, our hall government committee was called Coffee Hour and our job was to host foreign movies with coffee and intellectual discussions. We deemed that super lame and instead spent our whole budget line item on Zombie Week.

1358890546.0	172vnh	World War Z Fan Film? (Upvotes for visibility please!)	mustCRAFT	680	221	133	"Alright, we've all seen [this trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcwTxRuq-uk) and like most if not all of you, I'm pretty sad about what Plan B did to the story. However, when discussing this with a friend of mine who is a film student, we came to the realization. This movie could be made INCREDIBLY cheaply and quickly with a small cast of devoted actors. They don't even have to be in the same area of the world for filming (Thanks to skype and the magic of modern film manipulation) All we need now (primarily) is a cast! So, if you look/sound like a character from the novel, or know someone who does, please comment here (or preferably post a video with maybe a short monologue from the book!) and we can get this show on the road!

I think crap, so I show the guy my inhaler as I'm walking through, he says ""You have to put that through x-ray"".  So I turn round and dump it down, as I'm walking through this time, he stops me again, and says with a dead straight face ""We appreciate what you do""... I said ""We try...""

1341695019.0	w6ybl	What do you guys think of a subreddit that takes place in a zombie apocalypse?	Polite_Werewolf	529	142	116	"It will be kind of like a role-playing kinda thing, where members post their ""stories"" about surviving the zombie outbreak. Members will add their survival accounts and fake news articles about the outbreak and spread of the infection. The stories should be written in the first person and the comments from other users will be like they're in the same outbreak.  

Would anybody be interested in that? The thing is, i've never started a subreddit and have no clue where to start and don't really have the time to get the ball rolling with anything of my own to post.  

EDIT: Wow! Well, it seems that people are interested. Just need to figure out a name for it. And, i'm a little computer illiterate, but i'll see what i can do.  

EDIT 2: What do you guys think of somehow mapping the spread of the infection as well? I'd rather it not be like ""boom! Zombies everywhere"". I'd like there to be a spread of the infection and members post the infection spreading into their area. Maybe members can post stories of the infection popping up in their area and it is successfully pushed back... for now.  

EDIT 3: Well, somebody went ahead and created it for me [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditofthedead/)."	t5_2qi0e	True

1371784614.0	1grtic	Just went and saw the pre-screening for World War Z. I've read the book, I still enjoyed the movie. Here's why..	Shouldergiant	348	86	174	"Alright. So first and foremost, THE MOVIE IS NINETY-SEVEN PERCENT UNLIKE THE BOOK. For those of you that plan on seeing the movie, Do what I did. DO NOT COMPARE IT TO THE BOOK! If you already know its been re-created for Hollywood's taste, criticize it for its film quality and not how it isn't the book put into film. Again, DO NOT COMPARE IT TO THE BOOK!

The movie is set in at a time where the events are unfolding and taking place. It is not an aftermath movie where they look back on different stories from different people (although they do take the traveling into play that the book did, which i enjoyed. I would have been fairly upset if it all took place in one city.)

A lot of the differences they made are okay for film. Most of the audience isn't going to be the die hards that are here in this wonderful sub-forum. (heh) Keep that in mind when you are seeing this movie.

I don't want to give to much away so I will leave saying this. Watch the movie, try to enjoy it as zombie movie and not as the book which it is named after. I for one don't like going to the movies, paying for a ticket and trying to find everything I didn't like about what I just watched so my point is just make the best of what it is. Who knows, maybe they'll remake it like the did the hulk a million times.

TL;DR: I'd probably watch it again.

EDIT: Woke up this morning and was pleasantly surprised to see so much discussion on one of my favorite subjects. I just want to state that I am just a guy who loves zombie movies and the genre as a whole. I go as far as picking up b list zombie movies just to enjoy someone else's view of the undead. One big thing I can take away from the WWZ film is that hey, I got to see someone put a big budget into a topic I enjoy learning about."	t5_2qi0e	True

**EDIT/UPDATE:** So wow... I actually didnt expect this post to go this far... But I thank you all for the votes and comments... making for some good reading tell ya that much.... But I feel i need to address what I have seen to be a common question... ""What if she found you, and you were turned?""  So, I asked her today... Her response was, ""I would shoot you in the head, get somewhere kinda safe, cry for a lil bit, then keep it moving.  Just cuz you're dead doesn't mean I need to be too""

So, there we have it"	t5_2qi0e	True

I want to call it right now. Even though we're a whopping *two episodes* into the season, it's looking real good. Haven't said this about television in a long time, but *I can't wait for next week's episode.*

After countless zombie films, books, games, adaptations, and blatant Romero and Matheson rip-offs, did anyone ever figure that we'd see something this terrific on *television*, one of the most restricted mediums out there? And they're really putting some heart into this project, and I admire that.

I love how they're pushing the limits with content, for one thing. One of the most apparent obstacles with a zombie television series is the limitations on graphic scenarios and realistic violence, both major hallmarks in many successful zombie projects of decades past. Thanks to the late time slot and the cable network hitch, we're getting a decent zombie series that measures up to any of our favorite zed films, books, or games.

I don't remember the last time I've seen such graphic violence in a network television program (then again, I don't watch a whole lot of television, and I've only ever viewed this series on my computer). However, even when it's played-down, violence is everywhere on T.V., and it's becoming easier to digest, these days. Meanwhile, good things that make you feel good like weed or *sex* are being shooed into some fuckin' closet. You can imagine my surprise at tonight's hot intro. *Zombie gets his wig split? Hurm, violence, nothing new. Prone-boning in the woods? ON T.V.? Fuck yeah.* It's great.

I'm stoned. Bear with me.

Two episodes in, and we've already been given a very rich beginning that satisfies more than you'd expect from a zombie show (or even some mainstream zombie films, for that matter). At the rate that it's going, it's like getting a nice new *zombie movie* every week, complete with the horror and suspense that we know and love, and some great character development and drama. Not one minute of these two episodes has bored me, at all.

Now, here's a geeky one for youse fellow zombie fans: They've reached a nice balance with their zombie behavior. Most people are on different sides of the fence when it comes to speed. Many continue to support classic shamblers (I sure do), for the suspense factor of hordes slowly closing in (and slowly killing- who wants to die like that?), not to mention the logistics that would figure in with any instance of a reanimated dead body. 

Others dismiss slow zeds as weak, and don't understand why they're so creepy (and that underestimation will get them killed once it actually happens, right?), preferring the ferocity of the 28 *Dawns* Later variety that can beat *and eat* any friggin' track star on the block.

I like how these ghouls just mill about when they aren't engaged, but then proceed to push their dead bodies as fast as they can when they find something that they want to chomp on. Some gripe that slow zombies are stupid, others remark that speedy zombies are bullshit. But these semi-jogging zombies? Seems fine to me. Remember Bill Hinzman? He did it. Don't forget the brick-wielding zeds in tonight's episode, either.

Nice cast. Even though we've seen a few of these folks before, they don't manage to spoil the scenery. I'm glad that they aren't going with any sort of high-profile folks, so far. It'd be too distracting, and it'd destroy the character development that they have going. The day that someone notable guest stars on this show is the day that folks will take it less seriously.

For example, Michael Rooker was a good call. Sure, he's been around (from *Henry* to *Slither*, and even fuckin' *Mallrats*), but he hasn't spoiled it for himself. And, even if he is a notable actor, he isn't over-exposed. And I hope that this isn't the last time we see him, even if his character is repulsive. Hope this also opens the door for other cult actors to take part (for starters, get Tom Saviini and Bruce Campbell on this show. Now. They will make absolute bank with the ratings for those episodes).

Shit, I could gush about this all day. I'm glad that Frank Darabont is on this project. I haven't seen a Darabont film that I didn't like, yet, and I just hope that they don't start handing this show off to dipshit newbie directors in future seasons. They'll copy Darabont's style for a few episodes after the transition, and then they'll start fucking it all up, just like when Disney bought *Doug* from Nickelodeon.

The series is off to a good start. Already, it's doing wonders for the zombie genre. We go through genre phases every decade, with vampires, werewolves, evil witches, and gimmicky slashers popping up for a few years, and then fading away under the tracks of a new trend. 

Many have commented on the rise and fall of the zombie genre within this decade, and the majority of folks expected zombies to fade away, and make room for Edward and Jacob. Those people are *fuckheads*, but I don't blame them.

Even if folks have been getting tired of the same zombie fare, lately, it's definitely finding a sort of new life on television, where it hasn't been, before (not as prominent, or freely creative, anyway). Just goes to show that you can't keep the undead down. Soon we'll have a teen soap opera based on *The Lost Boys* on that Noggin channel, just you wait, folks... *CRRRRRYYYY LI'L SISTER*

Just kidding.

Excuse me, please. I'm stoned. I'm drunk. I love zombies. This show is terrific. I will definitely buy the first season's DVD set. That gum you like is coming back in style.
