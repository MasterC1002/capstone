1331916612.0	qzkow	Would anyone be interested in an AMA from Brandon Keener (Garrus)?	AJockeysBallsack	2517	1044	214	"Upvote or downvote for results I guess.  I asked him on facebook, and he's curious, but doesn't really understand how an AMA works and isn't great at being questioned in realtime.  I explained that he's not technically ""on the spot"", as he doesn't have to answer questions ASAP, or at all if he doesn't feel like it (AMAA).   I linked him to the general IamA page nad warned him about Rampart :D

Mods, can this be done in here or would it have to be specifically in r/IamA? Are there simply too many people here who would be a total dick to him even though he had no hand in the ending of ME3?

edit - All you folks mentioning that you follow him on facebook, help out!  Tell him how it would be our pleasure!  Or don't say anything.  I don't know.  I don't wanna make him feel pressured.  Gah.

double edit - Sashimi made a great point, so I told him not to feel rushed.  Even though most of us here are cool enough to not be a dick about things he had no control over, giving a little time for the righteous fury of a million nerds to go down isn't exactly a bad idea.  Man, I wish I got karma from self posts.  Look at all that sweetness.

March 20 edit - No reply so far.  I will not become dejected and sick of life itself until at least a month has passed from the initial response.  Don't do this to me, Mr. Keener D:"	t5_2rc19	True

1332338993.0	r6qkc	Garrus Vakarian	saldigenova	1249	284	268	"He steps on necks.

Garrus knows what Tali's face looks like.

On Tuchanka, Garrus got twenty-four mating requests. There were also seven for his sniper rifle.

Garrus chose to get hit by that gunship. He was tired of looking so damn good.

Cerberus didn't resurrect Shepard so he could save them from the Reapers. Cerberus resurrected Shepard so he could save them from Garrus Vakarian.

Garrus Vakarian sees the Reapers as promising rookies.

The Reapers aren't waiting in dark space, they're hiding from Garrus.

Morinth once had a mind-meld with Garrus Vakarian. She complained he never called her back.

The krogan genophage doesn't actually do anything, it's just that the krogan have given up surviving knowing that Garrus Vakarian is out there waiting for them.

Garrus Vakarian doesn't need biotics; he just has to glance at things and they run away screaming.

God offered Garrus Vakarian the gift to fly, which he swiftly declined in favor of ridiculous headshot accuracy.

Garrus Vakarian was actually on the ground when the Virmire nuke went off. He later complained things felt too drafty.

Garrus Vakarian didn't join the Spectres because you can't break all the rules if your job doesn't have any.

If you can see Garrus Vakarian, he can see you. If you can't see Garrus Vakarian you may be only seconds away from death.

When Saren learned Commander Shepherd was after him, he scoffed. When he learned Garrus Vakarian was with her, he sat in the corner of his shower and cried for 3 hours.

Saren only killed himself to avoid Garrus doing it.

Harbinger thought about making a turian Reaper instead of a human one, but then remembered there was already Garrus Vakarian.

After much debate, the Council decided to unleash the genophage on the Krogan rather than the alternative of sending Garrus Vakarian. It was deemed more ""humane.""

Garrus Vakarian keeps his friends close and his enemies in scope.

They named the bridge he held on Omega after Garrus once he left. They had to rename it later unfortunately, because no one crosses Garrus Vakarian and lives.

Garrus Vakarian always has sex on the first date. Always.

Once you go Garrus, you are physically unable to go back.

Garrus Vakarian is the reason why Waldo is hiding.

Garrus Vakarian can perform calibrations, while in the middle of some calibrations.

Garrus Vakarian's favorite store on the Citadel, is himself. He dishes out pain at unbelievable prices.

Miranda's Impressive is not as Impressive as Garrus's impressive.

Garrus Vakarian's calendar goes straight from March 31 to April 2. No one fools Garrus Vakarian.

Garrus Vakarian's eyepiece doesn't really do anything; he just covers one of them out of fairness to everyone else.

Garrus Vakarian destroyed the periodic table, because Garrus Vakarian only recognizes the element of surprise.

And You will upvote this post for visibility because we demand it.]	JerziDevil	1171	263	117	"So, some of you may remember the topic of a [Mass Effect Beginner's Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/wiki/index) thrown around in an earlier thread. 

Well, it's being made as you read this. I and my platonic ward, [SimplyWaffle](/u/SimplyWaffle), have been tasked with the charge of building it from the ground up. If you checked out the link provided, you probably noticed that it doesn't have any information beyond some basic comments and some sci-fi references. 

Why? Well, because ~~I'm lazy and haven't gotten around to doing it myself~~ I want to include input from as many people as possible. Is there something you really want to be included? Or do you have access to some super-secret information that could potentially fuck our worlds up? Tell us. Message me, message /u/SimplyWaffle, or just provide a basic summary of what you want in the comments below. 

The point of this is to provide new players with a simple means to maximizing their enjoyment. This means that [spoilers](/spoiler ""spoilers"") need to be absolutely avoided as much as humanly possible. 

And there's no reason this can't be fun. Anyone can find a strategy guide or walkthrough anywhere. This is good. This means we can pilfer all their hardwork for own guide. We'll cite sources as best we can.

So if you want to make a small contribution, or if you feel ready to take it on as a full contributor, let me know what you can do. Sashimi_taco can provide ""compensation""* for any work done for the viewing public.

Call for supporters, volunteers	Marqued	1035	268	169	"Last night, we ([/r/masseffect](/r/masseffect) decided to [react to ReTake's campaign halt](http://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/r9bfi/rmasseffect_hold_the_line_our_response_to_childs/). Are we ""demanding a new ending?"" **Nope!** But ReTake helped show the community that there is so much more we can do if we band together for good. :)

Thank you so much everyone! After a restless night, we have our hub page - [http://www.fullparagon.com](http://www.fullparagon.com) and donation page [ready to go!](http://www.razoo.com/story/Full-Paragon) I will need some volunteers to keep this campaign up and running. If there's a skill you can contribute, please let me know: polishing/maintaining the website, working on fliers, art and graphics that tie into ""Full Paragon"" or show that we're an army of Shepards looking to do good. We can even put videos together.. whatever you guys want to do, we can do it! :)

*The Full Paragon campaign reached out to Kids Need to Read, a charitable foundation started by author PJ Haarsma, actor Nathan Fillion, and Executive Director Denise Gary, which focuses on supporting children's literacy.'*

*According to their website, ""Kids Need to Read works to create a culture of reading for children by providing inspiring books to underfunded schools, libraries, and literacy programs across the United States, especially those serving disadvantaged children.*

*Mass Effect is a story-driven series with an incredibly rich universe. The trilogy has attracted a passionate following of imaginative, giving people who want to open up exciting new worlds to children through books and stories in the same way Mass Effect did for the players. We're elated to be supporting Kids Need to Read, for their efforts in raising children's literacy all across America.*

**All the funds raised in this campaign go to Kids Need to Read - our motivation is comply to do good, and show the community what a group of awesome, imaginative gaming fans can do.**

* http://www.twitter.com/fullparagon

* http://www.facebook.com/fullparagon (need help keeping this updated)

* I worked with KNTR's executive director last night. She is very excited about the campaign. :)

* The website will stay pretty simple, but I'd love help updating it with press releases, cool Mass Effect news, updates on the campaign drive, etc.

EDIT:

* **Over $1000 raised so far! :D This is awesome, you guys!**

* **[THE SITE IS BACK UP WHEW](http://www.fullparagon.com). :) No drama there, just Dreamhost being a spazz. In CASE it happens again, the [Razoo Fundraising Page is separate](http://www.razoo.com/story/Full-Paragon) .**

* Jinxed, Dreamhost promises we'll be back up ASAP. http://www.dreamhoststatus.com/2012/03/23/connectivity-issues-with-one-of-our-datacenters/ Sorry guys! Please use Razoo temporarily to direct people if they're worried the site is down :(

* And back up. :P In time for the weekend!"	t5_2rc19	True

1362590771.0	19s9y5	Bravo, Bioware. Bravo.	SinSlayer	847	172	191	"I'm a ME fan. I thought ME1 was revolutionary. I thought ME2 was amazing. I thought ME3 was extraordinary, save for the last ten minutes. I hated the ending; even the DLC. I never felt like I had any closure. It felt rushed and disconnected and ham-fisted. It felt like we ended an epic journey with a flat tire and a busted radiator.

And then there was Citadel. I have to say that the Party was an almost perfect way to end the game. Spending time with my friends, enjoying some drinks and some laughs... it was perfect.

It's funny to call them that: my friends. 

It's a game. They're just characters in a pre-programmed scenario with a limited set of variables. But this DLC made me realize why I hated the ending so much; I AM Shepard and these ARE my friends, and at the end, I never got to say good-bye. I mean, a quick vid call right before the last assault didn't cut it.

But this... this made me feel whole; it made the game feel complete.  And it shows just how brilliant (some) of the people over at Bioware are; they created a universe out of nothing and made people fall in love with it, with the characters, with the places; they generated REAL emotions. I'm a grown man, I know the difference between fantasy and reality, and I know a video game when I see one, but, from the bottom of my heart, I will miss Liara, and Joker, and EDI, and Ash, and Wrex, and Grunt, and Maranda, and Jack, and Kasumi, and Zaeed, and Samara, and Tali, and Vega, and Cortez, and Treynor, Javik, Jacob, and Garrus. I will miss Anderson. And I will miss Legion, and Thane, and Mordin.

I will miss my squadmates. 

I will miss my crew. 

I will miss my friends.

Well done, Bioware. Well done indeed."	t5_2rc19	True

I thought one of the most touching moments in ME3 was when Liara comes to talk to you about the ""time capsule"" that she is working on and asks how she should portray Shepard. There is an overwhelming sense of dread throughout the game that if the Reapers aren't defeated, all will be lost. Liara, however, manages to find a glimmer of hope even in the possibility of outright defeat and extinction.

I thought it would be awesome if Shepard failed to acquire sufficient resources to win the war against the reapers, that they do actually win and humanity and the other advanced species are wiped from the galaxy. But then there would be a scene with a new unknown species- an advanced race of the next cycle, uncovering Liara's capsule. They activate it and then listen in awe as the voice of a long-dead Liara speaks out, describing Shepard, the champion and hero of the previous cycle, and the struggle against the reapers that ultimately failed.

That is what I would call a bittersweet ending."	t5_2rc19	True

1330907741.0	qhtrk	Gentlemen, Mass Effect 3 is almost upon us. I'd like to say a few words.	InfinitePower	795	204	232	"So, here we are. I, like many others, am using a [VPN](http://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/qhnmh/how_to_play_me3_pc_earlier_than_usa_street/), so this is the last night I'll be just laying awake, browsing Reddit and listening to the Mass Effect 1 and 2 soundtracks on repeat. Suicide Mission, End Run, Sovereign's Theme, New Worlds, Mass Effect Theme, From The Wreckage, Spectre Induction. Tomorrow, I'll get back home around 3 PM, and play the final chapter in the story of Commander Shepard's journey. It's been a long wait, and now it's almost here. 

Mass Effect came in 2007, and blew our collective minds with Saren, the Genophage, the Citadel, Virmire, Asari, Turians, Krogan, Quarians. There was so much to do, so much to explore. It was unpolished. It was buggy. It was *beautiful.* Then, after a three-year wait, came Mass Effect 2 in 2010. I, like many others, was very skeptical after playing the demo. The powers, the combat, everything seemed dumbed down. Then, I picked up the game, and played 20 hours in the first two days I got it. The sheer quality simply overwhelmed me. I was in awe. 

The combat was slicker and more tactical. The dialogue was better, and the loyalty missions were things of absolute joy. Mordin and Legion were introduced, two of the best characters in video gaming, *period*, and all the characters from the previous game (well, almost all - fuck you, Kaidan/Ashley) were given real, proper development. Garrus became even more conflicted with the law after his time as a vigilante. Liara became a vengeful Paragade, hunting down [the very person she would eventually become](/spoiler ""Lair Of The Shadow Broker""). Tali became more than just a codex entry on the Quarians. Everything was expanded upon, and everything was fleshed out. Plot threads were continued, but barely any were finished. It was a fantastic game, one of the best I've ever played, but I needed more.

Now comes Mass Effect 3. It looks to strike a wonderful middle ground between Mass Effect's sprawling, shabby approach, and Mass Effect 2's focused, lean, yet constrictive gameplay. Loot is back. Weapon mods are back. Health is non-regenerative. Powers are more customisable than ever. The Paragon/Renegade system now rewards neutral play. Environments are far larger. The squad is more focused. Almost. Every. Single. Complaint. Has. Been. Addressed.  We've sat through the good times. The announcements. The launch trailer. The AMA with Jessica Merizan. We've sat through the bad times. The Day 1 DLC. The Bioware hate crowd. The spoilers. Finally, it's almost here. Goodbye, ladies and gentlemen of [/r/masseffect](/r/masseffect). You won't see me for a while. I'll be off saving the galaxy."	t5_2rc19	True

You know how Joker talks about his family that lives on a farm way out on the outskirts of civilized space?  
You know that PTSD Asari at the Citadel Hospital that talks about how she was stranded on a farm way out on the edges of civilized space?  
  
The girl she rescued, accompanied, ended up killing the indoctrinated family of, and eventually murdered to keep her crying from alerting nearby enemies was named Hillary.  
  
Joker's sister is named Hillary.  
  
That Asari Commando with PTSD in the Citadel Hospital killed Joker's entire family, and none of the characters even know its happened. But the really terrifying part was when I realized what this meant for the implications of the ""Allow the patient to have a gun"" option that comes up at the Spectre Terminal.  
  
She probably *knows*.  
  
She spent several days with Hillary. They probably had a bit of a rapport going. Hillary would would be worried sick about the family that she knows is on the farm and the brother who's personal pilot to the famous Commander Shepard and doing who knows what. I wouldn't be surprised if the Asari get to know Hillary pretty well, and lots of trivia about her family members.  
  
And how could you not mention you brother is best friends with Commander Shepard? And I bet he's famous enough at this point that the Asari knows who he is. So she stages this rescue mission, and it goes bad, and she kills the family. And then, to save herself, probably thinking it won't even buy her that much more time anyway, she kills Hillary.  
  
By some miracle, she's rescued, and she ends up back on the Citadel. But, she knows who she's killed. And she can't take it. She wants out. She knows. And every time Shepard walks through the lobby she *knows.* And every time we pause over her or her doctor's shoulder, listening to this story we think is totally unrelated to us, she's panicking inside. ""Does Shepard know? Does Shepard know I know he knows!?"" And she keeps pleading for the gun nobody will let her have.  
  
And then, one day, an orderly gives her a package.  
""Special Spectre Authorization""  
A gun. Straight from Commander Shepard.  
  
To most of us, hitting X on that report was just ""paperwork.""  
But to her, especially if you played a Renegade Shep, we might've basically been saying ""Yeah, get it over with."""	t5_2rc19	True

I hate how he gets to ignore all the rules, just to advance the plot.

He's talked a little bit about the ME3 situation on his blog, but they're mainly comments to other posts. Check it out at: www.brentknowles.com



----
""I read one recent blog post where the writer basically said 'the ending was awesome because it was just like a movie' and I think she was missing the point.

It is a game. Not a movie.""


And more specifically, its a role-playing game. The players are *part* of the game. Part of the process of building and experiencing the game, much more so than with most other forms of entertainment.

---
Entitlement is really a right, for the gamer, because they have participated, actively, in the game itself.""



---
""Again, I can't speak to the actual ending myself, because I have not played it but in general I'd say a Role-Playing Video Game Trilogy Ending should (try to) do the following:




1. Reward the player's choices throughout the series. The big stuff they did should be noted. They should *feel* like they had a unique impact on the world.

2. End on a positive note. This is really important for video games...life in general is full of s****y stuff happening all the time. When I invest a hundred hours into a game I need to walk away feeling like a hero.""


---
""When you waste a couple hours of a person's life with an artsy/depressing movie or short story or even a novel, it is more forgivable because the time spent is less. And presumably the consumer knew what they were going into when they started. Certain directors create certain styles of movie. Certain writers write specific types of fiction.


---
On the other hand somebody playing an epic role-playing video-game trilogy is going to *expect* to be the hero and save the universe. That's why they are playing the game. When expectations don't match reality, disappointment is created.""

---
""It might be an artistic/creative move to go with a different style of ending but I feel its the wrong choice, especially for a videogame *trilogy*. Make your middle game bleak if you want to, but end the series on a high note.""

Man, it ranks as one of the top moments for me in the final mission.

And I literally got an erection watching Krogans charge into the ranks of Ravagers that was laying down heavy suppressive fire on their Kakliosaurs.

Let's not forget that part with the banshee horde. Just when it seemed like all hope was lost, BAM, Geth Prime shock troopers dropping down from the sky and blowing those ugly bitches up.

Need I remind you about the scene where Samara and the Serrice Guard commandos teamed up and defeated a bunch of enemies, rescuing the Turian Blackwatch, Alliance Spec Ops Team Delta and the STG? I came. The banter between the elite troopers were pretty entertaining as well. 

What an awesome final mission.

Go ahead and list down some of your favourite moments in the Priority: Earth mission!

I put together the video and uploaded it here: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2wFhm7j7xk&amp;feature=share](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2wFhm7j7xk&amp;feature=share) 

I got the idea to record him after reading about all the anger concerning the ending. Keep in mind he has no idea I'm recording him and that these are completely candid thoughts.  

The only thing he knew about the ending was that he needed over 5,000 effective military strength. 

A couple more details:

* He played the game full paragon
* He played Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2 full paragon as well
* His love interest was Liara
* He started playing at release
* He has to play the game on max difficulty, talk to everyone, and complete 100% of all the missions, so it took him longer to finish than most

When he found out I had recorded him, he was actually really excited. It's a situation you can never reproduce and he would have definitely acted differently if he had known he was on camera."	t5_2rc19	True
