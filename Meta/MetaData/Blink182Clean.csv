We tried to do a one week ban but it was made apparent that a one week would not stop him and that he would attack all of us with multiple accounts. Some of you probably know who I am speaking of but I don't want to publicly shame anyone so I will not name them. Today we had to ban 4 alternate accounts so we don't know when/if he will get bored and stop. That's where we need your help! If you see any strange behavior or usernames that have insults towards us mods or anyone, or rude and/or insulting comments that are not made jokingly please report, downvote, and message the mods. This community is pretty kick ass and I know that we won't let one person ruin our fun.

In my opinion that kind of pisses me off. It's really awesome that people are inspired and want to do covers of blink's songs, but trying to ""correct"" the songs that they've obviously worked really hard on is sorta bullshit. Some people need to accept the way blink sounds NOW and just enjoy their music, old and new. We would all love the old TOYPAJ sound back, but that was so long ago and unfortunately, it's not going to happen. Personally, I think they've changed for the better. And I'm sorry if you don't agree with me, just my thoughts. Ok, bye! BLINK LIFE. FOR LIFE. "	t5_2s593	True

1374935719.0	1j5t6t	What makes me really sad for new (er) fans...	violinsontv	77	19	45	"First time I saw Blink was at a Christmas show about ten years ago.  They were fucking hysterical, great banter, and an infectious energy.  My friends and I were so pumped in our back row shit seats that some guy from a local radio station moved us up to the 7th row.  I was so excited.  I may have even flashed my 13 year old boobs (just kidding.  I was 16 and had no tits).  It will never leave my memory that I got to see my favorite band of all time, in their prime and they FUCKING KILLED IT.  

That being said, it seems like there are more and more posts lately of them performing live and Tom being incapably fucked up.  Don't get me wrong, musically they always struggled to match their live show to how it sounded on the album, but it never mattered because of how they engaged the audience.  And they seemed to be having FUN.  

Now it just seems to be a job.  Tom has to be some sort of mess to get out there, Mark gets annoyed because he has to pick up the pieces and Travis, well he's pretty much stayed the same and kills it every time.  The last two times I've seen them have been kinda bleak to be honest.  Banter seems forced and that sense of fun is near dead.  I know their music has gotten darker, their sound more mature, I don't expect them to be raising families and still writing songs about fucking dogs.  In fact I'm proud of them for evolving, even if I still love Dude Ranch the best.  But as a cohesive group of performers, they seem to be sliding towards an inevitable pitfall.  

I still love them.  I'll still go see them any time they come around.  But I'll always be hoping they'll come out like that one night in December at the Orpheum in Boston.  When I was so excited to be there that I didn't give a shit I had some of the worst seats in the house.  When they were the band that didn't feel like watching rock stars, but rather 3 old friends of yours who wanted to have a few laughs, play some music, and forget how much life can suck for a couple hours.  

So for you guys, who never saw them back then, who might never get to see them the way I like to remember them, I submit this link:  http://youtu.be/GgG4Xqrht5Q

Epic repost in this sub I'm sure, couln't find one from the show I was at, but for those that haven't seen it, this is how I remember them, this is how I wish they'd play every time I fork over $50 for a ticket.  For those who have seen it, watch it again, it's always nice to see your friends as you loved them best, even if they've changed."	t5_2s593	True

On this one specific day I decided to don my prized blink shirt. So skip forward two hours and I'm handing out breakfast tacos and assorted kinds of chips and I hand this younger guy a taco and he takes a look at my shirt and his eyes just light up and he begins to tell me all about how he loves blink-182. We talked for what felt like an hour as I handed out other food donations. Our conversations topics ranged from our favorite albums and why, what Scott is up to now, plans for the new album, Tom and Marks dog fetishes etc. etc.

The main thing I learned that day was no matter where you come from or what has happened to you, you can still enjoy music your whole life.

Ghost on the Dance floor is the same experience but from the opposite view. Since Not Now is obviously about death, it's not surprising to see that there will be a ghost (on the dance floor). The person in the song is acknowledging the presence of the person in Not Now. ""I saw your ghost tonight"" They CAN see them and also coincidentally wants to dance with the person from Not Now  for one last time.

And I think it'd be cool to have Angels and Airwaves and +44 play along side Mark,Tom and Travis and just have a big ass collaboration among their side projects.

Like for example the halftime show could open up with a beautiful choir rendition of The Flight of Apollo mixed with Disaster leading into Feeling This followed by a little detour of either After Midnight or I Miss You or hell combine the two. Then a full throttle of When Your Heat Stops Beating with tailing in behind First Date. At that instant Always starts playing soon followed by The Rock Show or 155.

It saddens me that even many blink fans don't know of this song because it probably would be in my top 10 favorite blink songs of all time.  I find that a lot of of their early work is often overlooked by people in general.

So what is in your opinion the most underrated blink-182 song?"	t5_2s593	True

When Blink came back together his voice wasn't like it used to, Tom trained his voice to create the Blink/AVA balance. I was uplifted when he came out with Love part 2. When I first seen the Anxiety music video, that's when i knew that Tom wasnt gonna back down from the hate he was getting from his fans. His lyrics can be poetic to just saying what the fuck he has to say. I will always be a Tom Delonge fan and i hope one day i can get a band together and share a stage with him.	t5_2s593	True
