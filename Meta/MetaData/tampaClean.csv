1308746440.0	i6597	Tampa Empire	bigblades	446	108	261	"The time has come to turn the [/r/Tampa](http://reddit.com/r/tampa) subreddit into the [/r/Tampa](http://reddit.com/r/tampa) empire.  

The first step is to march on [/r/lakeland](http://reddit.com/r/lakeland) and tell those few souls that we are declaring Lakeland to be an official part of Tampa.  Once we have expanded East we will have created a Tampa border going all the way to [/r/Orlando](http://reddit.com/r/Orlando).  We will then move into the [/r/Sarasota](http://reddit.com/r/sarasota) reddit and tell them that it is time to band together as west coast bretheren.  Having joined them to our empire we will need to consolidate our forces so the next stop is to invade the stronghold of [/r/USF](http://reddit.com/r/USF) and assimilate them into our Empire.  They have no chance, we already have them surrounded.  Having the full Florida West Coast together we march East on /r/Orlando.  This will be our greatest challange but Orlando is mostly tourists so we shouldn't have a problem convincing them they are actually in Tampa.  Once [/r/Orlando](http://reddit.com/r/Orlando) has fallen and we hold this central Florida stronghold we will have the power to take over all of [/r/Florida](http://reddit.com/r/florida).  

The road may be long my brothers and sisters but the [/r/Tampa](http://reddit.com/r/tampa) empire is strong.  Now lets go to [/r/Lakeland](http://reddit.com/r/lakeland) and give them their new masters.

1350966800.0	11xgtf	Florida State Senate District 22, Jeff Brandes was running unopposed, so I'm throwing my hat in the ring (its ridiculous that there is no official challenger).	mjohnson062	80	13	60	"Mods:  I'll understand if I'm about to violate a policy, but I actually didn't find one for /r/tampa and I need to indicate my full name.

My name is Michael W. Johnson and I just put my name in the write in block for Florida State Senate District 22.  The other option is Republican Jeff Brandes (who I know just enough about to disagree, plus, on principle, don't we have enough Republicans running the state already?).  My political party?  Presently I'm a registered Democrat, but only because at present, literally today, its closer than Libertarian or something else.  Why don't we say Toga Party.

Is this a joke?  No, I'm dead serious.  Impulsive?  Perhaps a bit, though I've known a while there was no official opposition, I figured by the time I'd be filling out the ballot that someone would have stepped up but I've found nobody.

Do I have skeletons in my closet?  Sure.  No dead hookers, no tax evasion, no felonies, no illegal alien employees.  Weed?  Yeah, sure.  Not today or in the recent past, but *ever*?  Sure.

Am I trained for public office?  Well, I'm a member of the public.  I am an Army veteran, non-combat, having served as a medic I received an honorable discharge.  I have an Accounting degree, but presently work in IT (sales though, so I'm no wallflower).

There are plenty of folks smarter than me, but I'm not so egocentric that I'm afraid to ask questions and seek counsel (and listen).  If elected, I vow to seek improvement without a single thought to my reelection.  Decent odds I'll curse on live TV.

So, if you're in Florida Senate District 22 and you're going to vote, consider writing me in, you could absolutely, positively do worse and nobody better has stepped up (unless you're happy with the default Republican, then knock yourself out).

TL;DR:  Republican running unopposed for Florida State Senate District 22; write in Michael W. Johnson (Independent).

EDIT:  [**There**](http://imgur.com/0KpTe) you have it.
EDIT 2:  Okay, the ""official"" redistrict map is [**here**](http://www.flsenate.gov/PublishedContent/Session/Redistricting/Plans/S000S9026/S000S9026_map_fl.pdf), but if you don't go out of your way to look for it, casual review seems to show District 22 as still being in Orlando.  If I were a conspiracy theorist, I'd say this was by design.

The [**interactive map**](http://maps.flsenate.gov/de1/map.html?plan=s016s9030&amp;mapext=-82.562%2027.894%20-82.454%2027.948) is available, but I apparently can't link to the properly zoomed display so I've captured it as a [**screen shot**](http://imgur.com/P1pC7) as well.  Finally (hopefully this links properly), you can go from the senate map to a [***Google Map of Florida State Senate District 22***](https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=27.842207424263,-82.593207914517&amp;t=h&amp;z=11&amp;q=http://www.flsenate.gov/PublishedContent/Session/Redistricting/Plans/s016s9030/s016s9030.kmz).


EDIT 2:  Appreciate all the support so far, you've inspired me.  I've been reading up on the logistics and believe I'll be able to take a more legitimate shot (presuming this longish shot doesn't pan out) next term.  Actually, I'll likely be able to take a simple leave of absence to serve (I had heard and confirmed that the session is 60 days, that's it!).  Ultimately, I want to force redistricting based on something simple:  Geography.

When I discovered all this, I filed a report with the local police in 2007 (did nothing) took that report immediately to Atny General's office who fwd'd it to their financial crimes. (who sent him a letter. It was criminal fraud, not securities.) There's no contract and nothing on paper but a few canceled personal checks marked ""inv"" and ""Bearer Bonds"" and maybe a couple other little notations. Mom's got Alzheimer's and she does not recall anything anymore. I've talked to lawyers until I'm blue in the face and nothing can be done in the justice system. (you got any ideas? let me know.) 

This dude took the money and bought two nice townhomes in Tampa, lives in one. We're from another state and I'd like to swing by in a few weeks and have a face-to-face nonviolent talk with the guy and his wife. (checks were cashed at a Wachovia in Orlando.)

Anyone want to join me? Stare evil in the face? Especially media people? I don't know what else to do but take it to the Internet and the media. I cant' do any of that alone. I really don't know what to do next. "	t5_2r7ih	True

I am an IT worker from Seattle, and to make a long story short, my fiancee left me after I spent all of my savings moving us to Europe. She is a European citizen and decided to stay there to live with family, and she bought me a plane ticket back to the states to what happened to be Tampa. I converted the few euros I had on me to dollars and made my way to Clearwater (where I am now) to see an old friend, but he has moved away. My cell phone plan that I shared with my fiancee has been turned off, so I cannot make phone calls, and finding a pay phone has been fruitless. I have access to email from my phone when I can catch a wifi signal, so on Tuesday I contacted the crisis center in Tampa and some shelters in the area, but no one has replied to me. I really have no family or friends to contact for help, and I am feeling pretty lost and alone.

 I am considering trying to get back to Seattle where I at least have a couple of friends that would let me crash at their place until I am back on my feet, but I literally have no money whatsoever. I have not eaten since Thursday. I have been sleeping in the woods and have been getting eaten alive by mosquitoes and spiders.

I am reaching out to the local reddit community for any type of assistance that anyone is willing to give. If anyone has any work that they need done that would allow me to earn a few bucks, I would be happy to have that opportunity. I would welcome any suggestions for further resources that might help me get fed and sheltered and help me find my way back to Seattle, where I have more resources at my disposal.

Thanks everyone for listening. Please PM me if you have any feedback.

EDIT: Thank you so much everyone for the outpouring of encouragement and resources. I will update my post when my situation has changed.

EDIT2: Thank you all for your help! I am overwhelmed and incredibly grateful for what everyone has done for me!

Highlight: One amazing person not only bought me a bus ticket back to Seattle, but put me up in a hotel for two nights so I wouldn't have to endure the tropical storm we endured. She was a godsend I did not expect this kind of help. She is one of the truly good ones, and I can only hope to follow in her footsteps.

Thank you Tampa /reddit for your support. "	t5_2r7ih	True
1368018320.0	1dxgl0	Tampa Folks: Help a local kid win a wheelchair van so he can go to grad school? (Not Me) (X-post from /r/assistance)	tresonce	63	3	28	"I was approached (now a few days ago) by a guy who is paralyzed in a wheelchair while I was in line at Subway and he asked if I would vote for him to win a wheelchair adapted van, it'd mean a lot to him, etc. etc. 

Well, I talked to him for a couple minutes while I waited to place my order and he seemed like a really nice guy, and I had my laptop with me at lunch so why, not, I'll go vote for him.

After I voted, I did some googling on him, and found a couple of articles about what happened to him:

[Tony Dowels' positive outlook, not his wheelchair, endears him to Florida Gators quarterback Tim Tebow](http://www.tampabay.com/sports/college/tony-dowels-positive-outlook-not-his-wheelchair-endears-him-to-florida/992477)

[Nothing sure but pain: A mother stays by her son after a paralyzing injury alters their lives.](http://www.sptimes.com/2007/06/10/Hillsborough/Nothing_sure_but_pain.shtml)

I thought two things: (1) Man, this kid didn't mention any of this when he handed me his voting link on a little piece of paper. (2) Wouldn't it be great if he got this? This is a kid from the Tampa area who, if he won the van, would use it to go back and forth to his internship with the Bucs this summer, not to mention give him some independence. 

For the record, I don't know this guy, and I'll probably never see him again, but if you guys could either go vote for him, or direct me to the right subreddit to x-post this, it'd be appreciated. I think I just had a moment today where I thought ""damn, it would really suck to lose the ability to walk and live normally for the rest of my life, and this guy has and has a more positive attitude than I do.""

Anyway, here's the link to vote: [http://www.mobilityawarenessmonth.com/entrant/antonio-dowels-tampa-fl](http://www.mobilityawarenessmonth.com/entrant/antonio-dowels-tampa-fl). 

The paper he handed me says that he needs 4,000 votes before May 10th (2 days from now) when voting closes.

For all the stuff we reddit-hug into DDOS-land, this is one I wouldn't mind seeing get some attention.

EDIT: Thank you to all of you sharing the link on your facebook/twitter feeds. Everything helps.

EDIT 2: Wow! We are up to ~2,650 votes! That's insane considering where he was at on Friday. Keep up the sharing, you guys are awesome.

EDIT 3: Over 3,000 votes!! You guys rock. He was at 400 votes when I met him on Friday. Also, I posted some additional information in the comments below.

EDIT 4: 3,700 votes! I think we'll break the 4,000 mark at this rate, which is fantastic.

EDIT 5: Voting is still open today (the 10th) ! Maybe we can break 6,000!"	t5_2r7ih	True

There is obviously loads of construction on the crosstown expressway. The non-express lanes are down to 1 lane in both directions. WHY THE HELL DON'T PEOPLE MERGE BEFORE THE LANE FUCKING ENDS? Seriously is this a Florida thing? A tampa thing maybe? Do these assholes not realize they are the ones causing the traffic by waiting until the last possible second and cutting people off? 

Then there are the extra special assholes who will intentionally leave the lane that is NOT ending and drive in the lane that IS ending in an effort to get around the reasonable citizens who are patiently waiting in the correct lane. There is a special place in hell for you fuckers. 

Lastly, these sonofabitches look at me like I'm the dickhead when I don't jam on my brakes to make room for them to enter my lane because they didn't bother trying to merge sooner. WHAT THE MOTHER FUCK. If I get the finger from one more of these cocknoses I swear to god I'm going to just ram my car right into their stupid tan cell phone talking faces.

EDIT:
I will concede. This ""zipper merge"" is news to me, and contradictory to what I remember learning in drivers ed (though that was 18 years ago). However, I still believe that 90% of the drivers who are driving in the lane that is ending are not doing so because they believe it will actually help the flow of traffic. They are doing because they are inconsiderate jerk-faces who want to get a ahead in the traffic. Believe me, if a person attempts to considerately merge while using a turn signal and paying attention to the drivers around them, I'm happy to oblige. Unfortunately this is rarely the case.

UPDATE NUMBER TWO @ 13:30 on 6/24 - I just spoke with Kat at Dunderbaks and gave her a rough head count of 20+. She is going to put you all in the private Beer Hall room. If you get there and aren't sure were to go, just ask where the 'reddit party' is, that's the name I put it under. You all have fun!

I spoke with 'Kat' at Mr Dunderbaks this afternoon. Depending on how many redditors show up, they may give us the room in back. If you are planning on going to the early meetup, please leave a response below so i can call her with a idea of the head count to expect. She also said those under 21 are welcome so long as they aren't trying to drink. It would be nice if someone could show up a bit early with some sort of signage to help other redditors find them. Usually, once the group gets large enough, it's obvious who/were we are. NOTE - I work so I will not be in attendance...someone please take pictures for posterity!

1297949553.0	fn6hj	Rick Scott is a DICK and doesn't know squat about trains!	gannon6790	54	13	61	"I'm pretty upset with our Governor.  

I'm fairly certain he did not give the high speed rail a fair shake.  

I feel like he's refusing the project simply to ""oppose the president's agenda."" ie - cutting off his nose to spite his face. 

I don't think his stated reasons to refuse the project are valid.  

1. I've heard it reported that rail companies have offered to take responsibility for maintaining and operating rail line, which makes his fear of the project losing money due to low ridership invalid.  

2. Scott stated that he was afraid that if the project got canceled during the construction due to cost overruns the state would have to repay the billions given to the FDOT by the Federal government.  This wouldn't be a cost to the state, it would only mean we return money that was given to us.  But how likely is that really?  Once a project that big get started it takes a huge overrun or a pull out of investors to cancel it.  I doubt the Feds would ""pull out.""

3. I would give some credence to arguments about ridership being less than projected.  But I bet the ridership projections are more likely to be short than overly optimistic.   When looking at a large project like this engineers and analysts should be using conservative numbers and projections.  and often you end up with a chicken and egg argument like the following: why would people ride on a train if they can't get around in the city once they get there?  both Hillsborough and Orange county have rather poor (IMHO) bus systems. often i've heard our buses run around mostly empty.  But once the train is available, i believe bus ridership will increase and this will help enhance train ridership we well.  

We, as a state, should be taking advantage of this federal offer while we can get it.  We've debated this subject way too long in this state to pass up an opportunity like this.

SO, I am looking for some people who want to get in on a letter writing campaign, who want to call Governor's office, who want to storm his building with pitch forks and torches, whatever we can do to make our will known and show him that he is not representing us correctly.    let me know of any groups you've seen already, I'm going to try to find some.  I'm sure they exist, I just wanted to get this out there.  I'm going to cross post this to as many Florida/other reddits i can we well.

TL;DR - Scott is a DICK who doesn't know anything about trains.  Lets tell him!

edit: ok, i apologize for the ad hominim attack in the title.  please don't think this is simply politically motivated.  I'm trying to base all my arguments on facts and studies, not politics."	t5_2r7ih	True

I grew up in Colorado and moved to Tampa about 10 years ago, and on every trip back home I would pack a suitcase full of Fat Tire and bring it home with me.  Well.. New Belgium is finally distributing to Florida, and the bar I work at is letting me put together a Fat Tire release party... not sure the exact details but would like to reach out to you all and see if anyone is interested?  It would be on a Wednesday, and we are a small family owned italian restaurant tucked away in a quiet spot of town, so it's not going to be crazy.  Depending on how much interest I get from everyone I talk to will determine how much I'm going to put into it... but I can say that there will be good food, probably some give-aways (t-shirts, beer mugs, etc.), and most importantly good beer!! 

EDIT:  TL;DR:  New Belgium Beers coming to Tampa, come to Gino's bar @ 10006 N Armenia on Wednesday August 7th for a Fat Tire release party.  More details to follow as the date approaches. "	t5_2r7ih	True

FritzMuffknuckle	44	6	2	"In [my original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/tampa/comments/zku7r/tampa_bay_times_runs_story_saying_technicality/) I addressed two major points I found fault with in her article. The fact that she left out the cover up by the States Attorney's Office and the ten top cops who wrote sworn affidavits to hide their fault, and the fact that she referred to a constitutional infraction as a mere technicality. I also left her a voice mail about my problems with it.

Since then she has responded by doing a major rewrite of the article. [Here's the article now.](http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/technicality-may-void-pasco-dui-checkpoint-arrests/1250522#) The title hasn't changed, but now it deals fairly with both these issues. Her follow up was good work. She interviewed an attorney about the constitutional issues and investigated facts about the cover up. I don't know if she fixed it before the paper was printed, but it's nice to see her step up when she could have just left it alone. She deserves credit for that.

I don't know how they do it, but apparently they change their menu on a weekly basis - - and from what our bartender told us, they do not rotate menu items....meaning that when an item is featured on their menu it is only featured once.

1365187914.0	1br0x1	My bad experience with Bright House	Dom_the_Wop	38	7	79	"EDIT: This problem has been resolved by Gary at Brighthouse. I don't want anyone getting out pitchforks, so I'm not going to revert any of my text, but I will say this: Gary actually listened to my concern and why I was feeling the way I was feeling. The communication with BHN was initially poor, and this has also been resolved.

2ND EDIT: No money changed hands (meaning, explicitly, this update was NOT purchased), but a meeting of the minds was had. Someone finally listened, and that in itself was gratifying.

======= READ ABOVE THIS LINE FIRST =======

Someone was talking about how poorly their Bright House service was working, so I figured I'd elaborate on how my experience went down. I'm massaging a story posted to my blog to fit better in this context.

BrightHouse Networks owns the local monopoly for Internet access in my area (North of Tampa), and unless I want satellite (hint: I don’t), it's also the ""only game in town"" for cable service. When I moved in, my hand was forced into choosing them, but because I had no personal negative experiences with the company (and there is literally no other choice), I ignored all of the complaints I read on the Internet.

Things went downhill right from the beginning. They missed the install appointment without calling, and when I contacted BHN to find out why, they had no record of my account. Not no record of my appointment, but no record of my account.

Once everything was installed, we were in for a rocky trip. The Internet constantly disconnected, and delivered speeds of a blazing (note the sarcasm here) 100kbps or so. I called BHN about this issue, but was told my account didn't exist. However, this rep was a smart cookie and realized that the phone system was routing me to the wrong division of BHN: I was talking to the Orlando people, but needed to be talking to Tampa. Frustratingly, this same thing happens every time I call, so I try to avoid calling them. I sit on hold forever in Orlando, just to be told they have to transfer me to Tampa. You'd think I could call a direct line, right? No, it takes over and ""helpfully"" transfers me to Orlando.

BHN sent a tech out. Heck, they sent two. Both told me different things: one said it was the wiring, and the other said that I couldn't have two TVs plus my Internet going at the same time. They both said BHN was not responsible for the problem, and it wasn't something that could be resolved. Luckily, one of the techs felt so bad about the ridiculous speed (it took over a minute to load web pages, and half the time, it just died) that he called a buddy (Jesse — go Jesse!) who knew more about ""special"" BHN issues than the standard techs. Jesse came out and said ""Wow, dude, you have that cable modem? It sucks. Try a different one."" We swapped it out, and bam: Internet worked! The only issue? BHN had changed me for MONTHS of non-working Internet that they refused to fix, and said wasn't their problem. Stay classy, BrightHouse.

Next, our cable was wonky. We’d be watching TV, and all of the sudden it'd say ""HD Service Not Available"" and knock the channel off. Rebooting would fix this, but it'd happen several times per day and who wants to wait 10 minutes for a DVR to reboot when you're in the middle of watching or recording something? Speaking of the DVR, it was completely useless because half the time cable service would die in the middle of a recording so there'd be half a program or just nothing in on the drive. Yet, we paid every month for the ""privilege"" of DVR service. We added a regular cable box for the bedroom, thinking that it was a DVR issue, but this box had the same problem.

Finally, before we went on a long trip, we suspended our service, since we've be moving two days after we returned. We scheduled this WAY in advance (months!), so there was no issue. However, when we got back, service was still somehow on. Perplexed, I contacted BHN. They said that our trip was too short by one day, and that disqualified us for service suspension. They couldn't go back and turn it off earlier or keep it off longer, so they just decided to bill us for the whole time we were gone! Awesome.

I was fighting on and off with customer ""service"" about this issue, but was getting no satisfaction. Finally, I cancelled my service. You aren't going to believe this, but the tech never showed up to get the equipment. I mean, seriously? And guess what? Yup, they kept billing me anyway. I had to send my Dad to get my cable boxes (I wasn't home for another month at this point, during a busy travel season) and return them to the retail store. Later that month, I sent my girlfriend to do the same for the cable modem.

I thought I was finally done, and I'd have them just discard my last bill for all of the troubles. Nope! I talked to John, a ""supervisor,"" who was wholly unable to even understand the issue(s) I was having, and chose to simply berate me instead. I disconnected with him and decided that I'd just cost BrightHouse business by telling everyone who'd listen my story .. and this isn’t even half of it!

I figure they've stolen over $1,000 from me in false billing, etc, so asking them to delete my $150 ""final bill"" seemed pretty reasonable .. especially since their techs failed to pick up my equipment, so I wouldn't even HAVE a ""final bill"" if they’d done their job.

Since that time (it's been a bit since I've moved a town up -- maybe about 6 months), I've convinced several friends, family, and even a stranger to switch away from BrightHouse. If you figure the average cable &amp; Internet bill is $150/mo, I'm costing them $1,800 per year PER PERSON that I convince to switch. That's over $10,000 this year alone .. and they could have easily avoided it by not making an enemy out of me. Go figure."	t5_2r7ih	True

I'm not too thrilled with either presidential candidate this time around but there are plenty of other things to vote on, so don't let that stop you! This will be my first year of voting from home via [absentee voting](http://election.dos.state.fl.us/voting/absentee.shtml). Didn't realize how easy it was. 

Just go here and fill out the form: http://www.votingathome.com/

I can already hear you now, ""But zumzum, there is this form field, called voter registration id, and I don't know what that is, because I'm here procrastinating at work and my voter id card is at home""

We both know if you wait until later it'll never get done, so I got you covered.

Go here: http://registration.elections.myflorida.com/CheckVoterStatus

Fill that bad boy out, then the captcha (high tech right?) THEN, once you get the page of results with your information on it, look to the right hand side for a link that reads: ""Your Absentee Ballot Status."" Click that mofo. On that page you will find your voter registration id.

After you fill out the aforementioned form, you will be verified and then hopefully a real live ballot will be mailed to your lazy ass. That gives you some time to do a smidgen of research. Read it all over carefully, then read it again, then fill it out, seal it up and send it in. And you're done, you didn't even have to put on clothes.

Update: As a few have mentioned so far, this is probably not the best way to vote, but you can be damn sure there are people who aren't going to bother voting because it's too much of a hassle. As I mentioned before, it's possible that we'll see record waiting/lines at the polls because of how long the ballot will be. Advance research and early voting are possibly your best bet, but this is handy for those lazy people who wouldn't be bothered to go out at all."	t5_2r7ih	True

A number of Wimauma residents discovered their large-breed dogs went missing for no reason. They believe someone has taken their pets to be used for dog fighting.

Many of the stolen dogs were boxers or pit bulls and nearly all were males.

Tonight's meeting takes place at 7:00 p.m. at the South Shore Library on Beth Shields Way in Ruskin.

For more information, e-mail stopdogtheft@yahoo.com .

If you have a missing dog, you're asked to report it to the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office at (813) 247-8200 and let deputies know your report needs to be linked with case #378158."	t5_2r7ih	True

It honestly brought me to tears watching this man hand me his cat as he walked away with just a trash bag full of possessions. I cannot even begin to imagine what he is feeling right now. He was evicted from his apartment this morning because he does not have any more money. I really want to see this man get back on his feet, able to have his own place again, and able to live with Onyx again. He is an international studies major that has just not had any luck finding jobs. Is there anyone who has any contacts that may be able to help him get a job (any job that pays)? I do not know what special skills or prior experience he has. You will have to PM him for that. I want to help this man out but have no contacts and no money to give. If he cannot find work soon I will have to begin looking for a permanent home for him. I want to give this man the chance to get his best friend back.

**Parking:**
Parking is streetside, first come first serve. How close you get depends on how early you show up

**Things to bring:**

 - Your drinks of choice (some mixers and ice will be provided, along with coolers and a beer fridge)
 - Something for the grill, or a side dish
 - Chairs, folding chairs, patio chairs, pocket chairs, bean bags, and other things to sit on.

Please comment with what you're bringing for food, so that we don't have 27 people bringing hot dogs and no one bringing buns. Also, if we can get someone confirmed to bring paper plates and/or cups, that would be awesome. 

Oh, and I've already thrown [two cases in the fridge](http://i.imgur.com/19V8p9h.jpg) to get the ball rolling. 

**Edit 1:** There is now a bottle of Captain Morgan and a bottle of Grey Goose sitting in the cooler along with the beer.

**Edit 2: ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?**

You are also welcome to bring any form of outdoor entertainment, including: horseshoes, cornhole, beer pong (being covered by boxbeat), etc. We will have a full karaoke setup beginning around 5PM (which should be long enough to get plenty of folks drunk enough to do karaoke. This has proven to be EXCEEDINGLY popular at our meetups. :D)

**Edit 3: WATERPOCALYPSE!!!**

It's hot, and there will be a lot of drinking. Can one or two folks commit to bringing some cases of bottled water?

**Edit 4: DAMN YOU FACEBOOK! (Photo album permissions fixed)**

**Edit 5:**

**Final Edit: TODAY'S THE DAY!!!**

### SECOND FINAL EDIT: Please check the map links above!

There is some construction going on in the neighborhood, and your GPS may lead you the wrong direction (although it won't be by much). The map links above have the current correct route (to avoid the long way).

We're super overwhelmed and have a ton of stuff to do. I'm looking at these dishes thinking 1. I don't have the time/energy to pack them up and 2. someone else could use them more than we could. We also have a free recliner, outside cabinet, Ikea barstools... Anyways, would love to exchange for some free karma or a pizza because we forgot we were coming back to food less apartment. Really, if you want/need any of this stuff feel free to drop me a PM and I'll give you our address. 


Take care and we will miss Tampa so much. I met up with a lot of great Redditors during my two years here. Our meetups were a blast and I thank you all that went out of your way to make me feel welcome when I first moved here! 

Edit: And pint glasses. We have so many pint glasses.

Edit 2: Pretty sure someone is coming to get the recliner. Also, we have a ton of VHS'.... My husband says I need to get rid of some but that he thinks no one else on the planet but me watches them. So if you're interested in those you could help prove him wrong. 

Edit 3: bludragon76 came earlier today and got the recliner. He was also kind enough to provide lunch to my husband and I. It was so appreciated as we have no food in the house and are insanely busy. Here's hoping real life karma for him! :)

This morning they revealed that they've been dissolved, and their radio station is now basically under a vote-controlled system powered by [this android application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jacobsmedia.WSUN#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDIxMiwiY29tLmphY29ic21lZGlhLldTVU4iXQ..).

~~I realize that this is local, and most of you are completely unaffected by this, but~~ the decision by the COX media group to go this way might eventually affect radio shows that you yourselves have grown to love, especially if it gets a great deal of support.

If you care enough to check out the facebook page for one of the downsized programs, you can see their goodbyes and listener support [here on facebook](https://www.facebook.com/themorningx).

As for myself, this is certainly one app that won't be hitting my phone library - I can already anticipate what will happen once a particular fanbase gets ahold of it and the same bands or songs simply repeat over and again.

The upstairs is reserved for us from 8:30 until 11 and is an awesome area with a rooftop bar, couches, patio chairs, tables, etc.  We are free to go join the general group downstairs on the dance floor if we like.  We still have that area after 11 but they will begin allowing people up after that. 

See [This Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/tampa/comments/1135v0/best_place_to_park_in_ybor/) for optimal places to park in Ybor and rates.

 Just remember food will be there at 8:30 and it stops being a private party at 11:00 PM so don't show up 3 hours late to this one!   We have plenty of space so feel free to invite some friends.  I'm sure the party will go far past 11 as we begin to mix with the general public but don't worry, this place isn't Czar or Prana,  The people are pretty nerdy for the most part.


I will be  providing some basic party food.  If you want to help with food please PM me with what you want to do or are willing to do and I'll get back to you.  Mind-Reflections has volunteered to be our DJ for the evening.

Since this is an outdoor venue there will be a backup date in case of inclement weather.  I'll address that in more detail if it looks like it might come up a few days before the party.  

Please post if you are planning to attend so I can get a very rough estimate of how many will show up.  I don't expect it to be accurate but knowing within 10-15 people would make planning much easier.

The movie looks really cool and unique.  It's based off of a book by the same name and well here's the [trailer.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-SQ0pgjXm0)  I was really looking forward to seeing it once I saw the kickstarter had been funded all the way and...

Well, it's out now but the only way to see it in a theater is to set up a private screening via [tugthefatkid](http://www.tuggthefatkid.com).  This only works if you can get 55 people to go see the damn thing.

So here's my predicament, I really want to see this movie, but I don't have that many friends :(

What do you say /r/tampa, will you go see a movie with me?  

I've set up a screening for Friday, Sept. 14th at 7:30 pm at the Muvico 20 in Centro Ybor, (hey, there's a bar in that theater) tickets are ten bucks a pop, (I think that's the regular price there) and the parking garage two blocks down is only a dollar for the first three hours.

Here's the [link](http://www.tugg.com/events/1341) to reserve tickets, it would be really cool if you could help make this happen.  

**Quick Edit:** I've made an [event](http://www.facebook.com/events/412258548822331/permalink/412321095482743/) on Facebook if any of you guys want to go and invite your friends or maybe want to help out by spreading the word a bit it would be rad if you could point people that way."	t5_2r7ih	True

Sorry, but now you get to pay $200 in back charges on your next water bill.""

A few days later the actual bill shows up and shows more than $360 due in back charges.  Bonus:  Billing date is 10/11, payment is due 10/18.

Mathematical confusion bonus:  the wastewater charge is $4.71 for a month's worth of usage.  $5 x 16 =/= $360!  Or even $200.

The most astounding part of the whole thing:  ""Per our code, we are authorized to backbill up to a period of four (4) years for services rendered, but not charged.""

They are sweet and SO adorable. Totally loving and friendly. They've been handled since day 1 so they are very social and spoiled. 

Rabbits make great pets but unlike rodents, do not do well being confined to cages all the time. They require daily exercise to stay happy and healthy because they need to run and play and require hay and fresh green leafy veggies to supplement a pellet rabbit food. Bunnies are easily litter box trained and both parents are. Life expectancy (with spay/neuter) is 10 years.

Good homes a must. I don't want them to end up in the wrong hands so there is a $25 rehome fee if you are not one of my friends. I've posted this here before with no luck but if you know of anyone that might be interested, spreading the word would be much appreciated!

2. A Saturday night meet-up! On Saturday the 14th, we shall have one of our regular bar meet-ups. This is where your opinion comes in: Ybor is one of our usual locations, and I enjoy it quite a bit. However, I know some people don't like Ybor that much, and I'm all down for changing it up and doing something different! Give me your ideas now, and closer to the date I'll pick something and post it.

3. A Sunday afternoon meet-up for non-alcoholic activities! Again, still undecided on this one, possibly something like meeting up at Fort Desoto for a cook-out, football, frisbee, skateboarding/rollarblading/biking down the trails they have. Or whatever.

I have recently moved to this area and am on a quest to find a worthwhile dentist. I will break the review down into 5x sections for rating, Facility, Assistant Efficiency, Pain Management/Dentist Skill, Time Management, and Price.

The following review is based off a scheduled root canal (non-emergency)

**Facility**

Coast Dental @ Hyde Park is located in an overal nice neighborhood.  Conveniently located next to a bewilderingly small hospital, incase there is an accident (*not foreshadowing i swear*). Parking is free and shared with the hospital.  The interior waiting room is clean and has recent copies of magazines. 3x of the operation rooms where small and cramp.  DA's and Dentist always had to move the operating chair to get by.  the computer system was extremely dated and looks as if they were built on a budget.  Each room features a 17"" tv on a wall mount that doubles the monitor.  (*always be apprehensive of in-flight entertainment*).  operating chairs were clean and in good repair.  equipment and tools seemed to be in working order.  the hyrdo-drill failed on my last visit.  the AC works well.  they keep the office around 65.  Bring a jacket.


**Assistant Efficiency**

3x of the dental assistant women were very friendly and out going.  two of the older dental assistant's always walked around with scowls on their face and repeatedly interrupted my operations to ask questions of the dentist.  i picked up that the lead dental assistant thought these two were idiots.  When i originally made the appointment, i informed the DA that i needed a root canal on my first visit.  When i got to the appointment. She had scheduled me for a 30 minute check up.


**Pain Management/Dentist Skill**

I will preface this section stating that **have** had a root canal by my previous dentist in philadelphia and know what is normal pain and what is bad pain.

This dentist did not give any sort of foreplay when it came to the needle.  No Topical, No Distraction Techniques... just in (*wiggle wiggle*) and out.  Outer gum line wasnt that bad but then he shoved the needle into my pallette (that hard skin on the top of your mouth).  Instantly, i was arched back and clinching my fists hard.  by the time he was done, most of the top of my mouth was swollen with the lidocane. 

As far as the Dentist's skill at actual tooth care... it is too early to tell.


**Time Management**

This one was a HUGE biggie with this dentist.

As previously stated, the receptionist scheduled an hour long root canal into a 30 minute checkup window despite being told this was for a root  canal.  Neither the dentist, nor the room was ready for a root canal.  After the dentist raped my mouth with his lidocane needle, he left to go do some fillings.  45 minutes later the dentist comes back and puts a clamp on my tooth to isolate it from the rest of my mouth.  The dentist then disappears again for a consult. Another 30 minutes pass.  Finally the dentist starts drilling.  As soon as he hits the root, i begin to spasm from the pain.  Doc shoves the needle back into my mouth unceremoniously then disappears again.  twenty minutes pass and the il-fitting clamp begins to dig in to my gum.  I get up and go find the DA to tell her that i could feel the clamp.  Dentist comes back for 10 minutes, cusses then says "" screw it, we'll have to pack this up and have you come back next week""  

appointment started at 8am.  i returned to work at 1pm in severe pain.  

&gt;&gt;tl;dr the dentist overbooked a time slot resulting in half done root canal for two weeks.

The next appointment went pretty much the same just that we finished.


** Price **

1x root canal =$2500 with dental insurance that covers 55%

a pretty steep price for the amount of pain and time wasted.

**EDIT: ** forgot the part where he dropped a drill bit into my throat and had to go digging with forceps. Good thing I don't have much of a gag reflex.  "	t5_2r7ih	True

Curtis-Hixon park has got to be big enough to set up a game there. And maybe we can bring some food and drinks. Make it a party. I was thinking maybe next Thursday (Aug. 8th) or Saturday (Aug 10th) around 7?

I had my car broken into last night in Ybor off 9th Ave and 17th St. Over $2000 lost, but the worst part is that a bunch of it was gifts from my wife over the years. If anyone hears anything, please let me know. Some items are an ipad 1, 2 old ipods (mini and Gen 3), a Dakine backpack (skater type with psudo-psycadelic graphics), green toolbag with assorted tools, 2 pairs oakleys (black oil rigs and Ryan Shecklers), 2 pair white Spy sunglasses, Alpine CD deck, kobalt wratchet set, and more. Any info would be a miracle.  I filed a police report, but they were not only less than helpful, but unbelievably antagonistic and disrespectful. Thanks for anything, wish me luck.

Edit: I put together a detailed list so I could report it to my insurance company, and it seems like a good idea to put it up here.  I've already had some awesome people give me a heads up about recent CL and ebay posts, so thank you all for your thoughtful help.  Here are the items I've noticed so far:

-ipad 1st gen, 16gb wifi
-ipod classic, 4th gen 20g

Last week a few of our meetup members thought it was appropriate to start spouting Racial &amp; sexual oriented Slurs at a very audible volume. I spoke with members of staff, thank the gods no customers complained however i still ended up having to apologize on our behalf.

Also, when i tried to address the usage of said slurs i, the meetup *host* was told to shut up, and that ""its just a joke""

**THIS IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE**

Folks, We're all grown adults, and i try to be as respectful to people as a i can, and raise my concerns in a way in which is non accusatory, but this cannot go on. We are not at a private residence, you do not have free speeches in a place of business. 

If this continues we may be asked to not come back! (if you needed a reason other than ""basic empathy"" to not spout harmful slurs in public)

This isnt a college frat house, or a brochacho club, i created these meetups as a safe space for ALL tampa redditors to meet and bond over boardgames &amp; alcoholic beverages (also fun)

I understand we sometimes lose ourselves in the moment, but going forward im instituting a new policy effective immeditatly:

**Any use of Racial, gendered, sexual oriented, or other Slurs will result in a verbal warning from me, and continued use will result in being asked to leave**

Location within store: It's on the far right hand side wall, by the baking section. 

Normally these run about $400.00 for the Artisan model. The one they have is ""cherry red"" and comes with the standard three attachments - dough hook, whisk, and beater. It also comes with a plastic baker's shield, which comes in handy.

I bought a silver Artisan mixer from the HomeGoods in Orlando a few months back - it's under the same warranty regardless of price point or source. If you've been wanting one but haven't bought it due to that high price, definitely take advantage of the sale!

1368680471.0	1efmxp	Engaged couple looking for roommates on new lease.	FinalBawse	29	6	43	"Hey there /r/tampa! My fiancee and I are looking for new roommates to replace our current ones on the upcoming lease. Our old roomies are buying a new house, but we've got ourselves another year or so in this location. It is a 3 bed 2 bath apartment with a large communal area (living room/kitchen). We're located near USF, so it's great if you're a student. 

Rent is about $400 (give or take $10-$15 depending on water and electric) a month per room (utilities and Internet are included in that). Though most months it ends up being cheaper. The apartment is 1100 sq. ft.

There are two rooms available and we'd like to fill them by the end of July (end of current lease). The leasing office would like us to inform them within the next week or two whether or not we have the intent to stay in this apartment complex for the new lease, so if you're interested in moving in, let us know as soon as possible.

Here is how the common area looks:

http://imgur.com/a/ed7ok

Now a little about ourselves:

We are both clean, outgoing, and very respectful! If you're looking for the perfect roommates, then that is definitely us. We do have a year and a half old kitty named Shoelace who is very well groomed, so if you love cats, you'll love Shoelace. We are also gamers at heart who are fairly intelligent, enjoy fun and in depth conversations about science, technology, literature, and history. I sing, draw, and build computers in my free time. My fiancee is a hobby musician who plays keyboard, drums, guitar, and bass. He also enjoy fitness, videos games, and movies.

We don't judge! Whether you be male, female, gay or straight. You're human and okay with us. Other couples for roommates is definitely cool too.


If you're interested, PM me and let us know. We'll be happy to give out a number or Facebook for those of you who are willing to meet up with us."	t5_2r7ih	True

2. Will you participate in the tournament? What entry fee would you pay to play in this tournament?

We have a room for rent in Hillsborough, right next to Westchase and Citrus Park. It is a 3 bed 2 bath house in a nice neighborhood. The owner is a nice young lady, and I've been renting a room here for the past 4 months. I'm a 30yr old professional dude, and she is a 30's professional laid back female (still too polite to a ask her age, haha). She is rarely home, and I work a typical 8-5 job and am gone every other weekend. Very laid back, clean, literally zero drama, cozy place. Nice screened-in back porch, all the kitchen and utility stuff any modern dude or dudette needs, nice room with a large closet, and ample parking. Comes fully equipped with a giant orange cat named Cigi (I call him Garfield because....Garfield). Rent is $450 plus +15 that covers cleaning and other supplies for the house, and monthly is fine with no lease/contract. She cleans all common areas and the bathrooms, and with a thoroughness that makes a former Navy guy proud I might add. Smoking outside only, and just be as respectful of the place and everyone else as you'd want them to be to you in your own house. If you have any questions or would like to come by and take the grand tour, send me a message and I'll get back as soon as I can. Needless to say, but still going to say it: no creepers, crack heads, gangsters, wangsters, pimps, whores, born again christians, or other similar unsavory folks need apply. 420 or whatever is fine, just as long as you have control over you life and are of a generally decent persuasion. Thanks, and hope to this helps someone!

Hillsborough County Commissioner Sandy Murman wants to welcome our law enforcement officers from around the state who are coming to Tampa and Hillsborough County, and to recognize our own City and County law enforcement officers who will be working the Republican National Convention (RNC) in the coming weeks.
 
This event will garner national and international attention from the media, the public, and a variety of other groups. Due to the secure nature of this event, the City of Tampa has requested support from multiple law enforcement and public safety agencies from the entire state of Florida. More than 5,500 public safety and law enforcement officers from a variety of agencies have committed to help us secure our area.
 
With all the planning and preparation for the RNC, the City of Tampa Police Department recently made the decision to provide a “Tampa Style” welcome bag for the visiting agencies. It is also an excellent opportunity to show our visitors that Tampa and is a great community and we want them to return.
 
“This is something we can do to say welcome to Hillsborough County and thanks to all of our officers for their hard work and help in providing security to protect our area,” said Murman.
 
Commissioner Murman has placed a “Thanks Bank” box in the Board of County Commissioners’ second-floor reception area to collect items for the welcome bags. We will accept whatever amount you can provide, but here is a suggested list:
 
·       Tampa centric items
·       Chap Stick
·       Energy bars
·       Energy drinks
·       Snacks
·       Sunscreen
·       Gum
·       Mugs
·       Cigars
·       T-shirts
·       Portfolios
·       Pens
·       Coupons/discounts to the law enforcement when they show their RNC credential at various local establishments, theme parks, museums, zoo, etc.
 
Commissioner Murman’s “Thanks Bank” box will remain available for “deposits” through Friday, August 17, 2012, at 3 p.m. For more information, please call 813-272-5470."	t5_2r7ih	True

They're a 501c non profit horse rescue who has saved and rehomed hundreds of horses. They've been interviewed by almost every local media outlet during some high profile abuse cases.

They are seeking donations for a young mare named Sara. She was a thoroughbred at the start of her racing career when she fractured her hock mid gallop. The owner has since waived all rights as the owner because they didn't want to pay the vet bills to try and save her. 

This is the common outcome of horses on the track all over the country. They're over bred, ran into the ground and then sold to slaughter. Don't support the racing industry, support the horses that have been used and abused by it.

Sara has 3 weeks before the window opportunity of treatment is closed. She needs a sling to relieve pressure from her fractured hock.

//Edit:


By the way I need a large group of people to meet at Curtis Hixon park.
---------------
http://cluster.gishwhes2012.com/ 

The above is the website for the scavenger hunt that I am doing and I have to do as much as possible by Saturday. My team is called  TheTeamFreeWillLovesDecepticons. We are from all over the US and my friend Brandi and I represent the Tampa department. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iysBt7Xqro

I can't find a good summary video but the above was from last years runner ups. 

This is all being facilitated by Misha Collins who played Castiel from the TV show Supernatural.

--------------------------------
Fellow Tampa redditors, my name is Kat and I am in the Tampa bay are a. I am doing the Greatest International Scavenger Hunt the World Has Ever Seen, or GISHWHES for short. I need a ton of help and will ask for unusual requests. 

I need to borrow the following items or help: (I will return your items after I take the picture or video)

1) I need three bearded men in ballerina outfits to successfully receive candy from treak-or-treating. (or if anyone who has adult sized ballerina outfits that I can borrow that would be wonderful)

2) I need a chicken suit to borrow

3)I need a group of people who is willing to be an abacus (thinking of doing this at Curtis Hixon park)


3) A four-post queen sized bed with headboard and foot board that I can borrow...And you are willing to let me put it at a Wal-mart parking lot so I can sleep on it. Heh.

4) A full storm trooper outfit 

5) A four-leaf clover (must still be green) and a person with a nose piercing. The four-leaf clover MUST have a stem.

6) Some strapping young (aw hell old would be fine) fire fighters wearing skimpy clothing out of kale. Bonus points if you have access to a hose we can shot water in the air in the background.

7) A uniformed veteran I can hug

8) A burrito and taco suit my friend and I can borrow

9) Some coats I can donate to a local shelter

10) Is there any real Olympic gold or silver medal winners in the area?

11) A couple who has been married for over 60 years sitting on a couch and sharing secrets to a happy and lasting partnership

12) Some ducks and geese I can play duck duck goose with

13) An orchestra that can play Kansas ""Carry on my wayward son."" (I play violin myself)

14) A flight attendant outfit

15) TV News station mentioning either my full name/team member's full name or the full team name. (The team name is TheTeamFreeWillLovesDecepticons)

16) A mariachi outfit

17) 10 people and a guy playing a snare drum in a mall. If you don't wanna participate but have a marching snare drum I can borrow that would be great.

18) A rock band with 1000 fans would be great. If you are in a rock band but don't have 1000 fans, I will try and find some people who can make the numbers.

19)A black and white TV set powered by antique stream-fed wooden watermill. Be sure there is a way we can get an episode of Supernatural on there. (I know, it's ridiculous. But kinda awesome.)

20) Some horses that I can borrow so I can pull a car in a corporate office building complex.


And so far that is all.  I know these are silly, silly requests but I am very, VERY serious about this.  If you are participating in GISHWHES, then I will be more than happy to help even you can't help me. So if you want to help PLEASE pm me. I have 5 days to do this so let's be creative, bold, and absolutely ridiculous. I will make sure I will give credit on where it is due.

I think at this point our community has grown to a point that we can expect to have 50+ people at a party.  This is great but it makes it difficult for any private residence to have a suitable size or parking for a gathering of this size.  

My idea is to rent out a little used section of a club called Barbarella in Ybor.  It would have a full bar, a ton of room, and can be completely private from the rest of the club.  I don't think we'd need to bother with a DJ or big dance floor or any of the typical club stuff.  I realize that most of this community wouldn't be interested in going to a club but for a costume party its the best venue I can think of as far as atmosphere, room, and facilities.  

I already spoke to the manager but have not committed to anything yet.  I really wanted to find out what the level of interest was or if anyone else had a better suggestion.

Food would be potluck, no admission fee, drinks would be like 1.50 or 1.75 - so not crazy pricey.  The room I am looking at has couches, a bar, a stage, and is an outdoor area with a partial roof.  Also, they will allow you in at 18 so you don't have to be 21+ for this place.

Anyhow - comments, suggestions, concerns?  Should I make this happen?"	t5_2r7ih	True

I lived in sarasota while younger and have visited tampa many times, so I am somewhat familiar with the area. However, as a young adult/professional/whatever I am lost. I would come down and check out everything a few times before making the move, but have a few questions first:

- Where are the good areas for independently owned, or delicious restaurants? Is there an ""arts district?"" Where do people in their 20s go out besides Ybor? Does Tampa have a good concert scene? 

- If money were no issue, where is the most ""hip"" or fun area to live? How do you find apartments around tampa? Is it easy to get cabs if you live around downtown? 

- How did you make friends if you did not grow up in the area? Are social sports leagues big in Tampa?

These are not rules that must be followed but are recommendations we have found through experience.  If there is a rule about it chances are it has been a problem at some point in the past.

1)  No paid parking - meetup should be held in an area with free and plentiful parking.

2)  No age restrictions - Sports bar type places are fine, but a lot of people do not drink or are under 21.  Don't leave them out.  

3)  Have a backup plan for inclement weather - If a meetup is held outside have a backup plan in place.  

4)  Organizer must include both a physical address, a google maps link, and any other instructions necessary for [anyone](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/) to find it.

5)  Provide a confirmation of attendance post on the day of the meetup.  If you post a meetup and it is made official you are taking responsibility to be there.  If you cannot show up you must post it so that other arrangements can be made and a new organizer can be selected.  

6)  Provide a contact number for questions, directions, or updates if the venue changes while in progress.

7)  Requests for official meetups must be made to a mod at least 2 weeks before the meetup date.  This allows us time to approve the meetup and post it to the banner so that everyone can see it and plan.

Message me to have a meetup added to the banner.

I took the initiative of [submitting a request to /r/favors](http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/f3tdq/request_for_a_graphic_artistdesigner_a_reddit/) asking if anyone could help. [spik31](http://www.reddit.com/user/spik31) responded and now we are in possession of a shiny new logo!

I've also taken the liberty of updating our sidebar with some local links. If you have any suggestions of other sites that would be pertinent to our community, please shoot one of the mods a message!

1375018410.0	1j7q0c	Anybody wanna play Civilization?	fizzlefist	21	2	64	"I'd love to get 6+ folks together on a weekend and play a nice long game of Civ.  The more the merrier for wheeling, dealing and backstabbing.  Especially if you roleplay as Ghandi and periodically declare war on your best friend from the past 5 centuries...

Just trying to guage interested for now.  Looking for either Civ 4 Beyond the Sword, or Civ V Brave New World.

EDIT:  Ok, there's definitely some interest, so hurrah for that.  Now comes the hard part, nailing down a time and place.  I'm thinking a Saturday or Sunday sometime next month, if possible.  Unfortunately I don't have the room to host many PCs at my place, though I do have an 8-port switch I could bring for networking.  Any suggestions?

EDIT #2: I've gotten a few private messages for Steam friend invites, and had the idea to make a Steam Group for Tampa.  I've gone ahead and made it public, so feel free to invite local (or not, there's no real rules) gamers and use it to discuss, play and organize LANs or board game meetups. http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Tampa_Gaming/

Edit #3: I've been looking at location possibilities, and if we can't find any other suitable spaces we could try booking a meeting room at a public library.  We wouldn't be able to bring any snacks and absolutely no alcohol, but with some extra power strips (and a router if the public wifi won't cooperate) we should be able to do a small under 20-person LAN fairly easily.

7/31 EDIT #4:  The library idea probably won't work, as meeting rooms are generally only loaned out for 2 hour blocks.  Still looking for suggestions for locations, or for organizing a weekend or nightly game on Steam."	t5_2r7ih	True

[The Independent](http://www.independenttampa.com/) is a beer and wine bar in Seminole Heights which also has a cafe and restaurant. There is no cover there. There is free parking by the Dollar General. Its an all-ages sort of place. 

So let's all meet up there on Tax Day, **Monday, April 15** around **7pm**. Its not super busy on weeknights normally and we can sit inside or outside or in little clusters or however you like. 

Address: 5016 N Florida Ave, Tampa, Florida 33603

Please respond here if you can attend and I'll PM you with my contact info in case of whatever. If it looks like this is getting super big, I'll talk to the bar a little ahead of time and see about getting the dart room.

EDIT: I'll tell the bartender to send people looking for reddit to me. I'll also probably make a sign. If I have time, it will have glitter. 

Questions? Concerns? Inquiries as to what pint to buy me as a thank-you? Please also post those below.

1323472867.0	n6txv	This is the letter I am writing to every single Florida congressman/woman...  *politics warning*	so_say_we_all	26	5	10	"Let me first apologize for posting a political topic in this subreddit, but I feel this should be more local, due to the content below.  Whether or not you agree with the politics of the new NDAA act (that will grant powers to the military to detain anyone anywhere in the world, including U.S. citizens on U.S. soil), YOU SHOULD BE LIVID!  Let me explain why:

Congress overwhelmingly passed a bill that would allow certain portions of the NDAA to be **kept hidden from public viewing until its passing.**  Whether or not you agree with the politics of this particular bill, *they should not be allowed to keep possible future laws from the people they're supposed to serve.*  This is legitimately scary, and I'm hoping that if you agree you will take the time to write your representative.  If you don't know how to articulate your anger, this is what I will be writing to every Florida congressman and woman:

&gt;Dear Congressman,
&gt;
I am writing in response to your vote on recent bills (H.R.1540 and S.1867) that allow you to keep certain portions of the newest NDAA secret from the public before its passing into law.  It gives me no greater concern that publicly elected officials are willingly hiding legislature that is supposed to serve the citizens in their district.  If Congress is so worried about public scrutiny surrounding this bill, then it seems to indicate that this bill does not serve the people as it should.  
&gt;
I am ashamed that not a single representative from the state of Florida, neither Republican nor Democrat, has stood up for the people that have elected them into office.  Your collective inaction, whether or not you are aware of it, is indicative of your indifference towards our personal liberties, and even your own.  I have been disserviced by my state.  You can rest assured that I will not be voting in the next election for anyone who voted ""Aye"" or ""Abstain"" to hiding U.S legislation from U.S. citizens, and that I will be spreading this information (and letter) to anyone who will listen.
&gt;
Sincerely disappointed,
(Your name here, obviously)

Since I was going to drop $50 on a shelter for us at a local park, I gave that money to [epicure_illume, our hostess and chef extrodinaire](http://www.reddit.com/user/epicure_illume) who is going shopping for meats/veggies to grill. She is planning on at least three or four rounds of grilling.

They have a fridge in the garage dedicated for beer/alcohol, a ceiling mounted projector with a 96"" (maybe larger) screen for visual stimuli along with surround sound for audio stimulation and a **HUGE** backyard with large trees for shade. 

I'll be bringing my EZ-Up 10'x10' canopy for some additional shade, a keg container to hold ice for drinks, a couple of extra trash bags and some beer...

...here's **what is needed** to help make the backyard BBQ/Picnic successful...

* ICE (multiple bags)
* Chairs (bring an extra if you have one)
* Keg Cups
* Napkins/Paper Towels
* Plasticware (aka utensils)
* Extra cooler (or three)
* Charcoal (three bags)
* Bottled Water
* Pop/Soda (2 liters or cans)

...and here is what you can bring if you'd like...

* Alcohol (Beer, wine, liquor)
* Mixers for above if you desire
* Chips/Dip
* Crackers/cheese
* Veggies (for grilling or a veggie tray)
* Potato and/or macaroni salad
* Meats for grilling (if you have something special you want)

...if you could please comment below with what you can bring from the list above so we don't end up with 20 bags of ice or 10 bags of chips.

There will be karaoke (aka drunkeoke), cornhole, hackysack, NERF guns, and other assorted activities to keep us entertained!

A preemptive thank you to all attendees for helping make the party successful!

[**IF** you're a Facebook user, please ""Like"" our **Tampa Bay redditors** page](http://www.facebook.com/TampaBayRedditors) and [RSVP for the event](http://www.facebook.com/#!/event.php?eid=108438362574491), it will help give us an idea of the head count.

There looks to be some interest in another meetup. I've been kicking around the idea of a Reddit Picnic/BBQ. Reserving a shelter at a local park. Firing up the grill, bring the Frisbee, volleyball, hackysack, horseshoes, etc. on a Sunday afternoon (say noon to whenever). Before I invest the time (and money, looks like about $50 to reserve one with access to parking/restrooms/grill, ball field, horseshoe pit and volleyball) to do the research and pull this together...**are you all interested???**

**OR...**

Should we find a **local watering hole on a Saturday evening for our shared debauchery**?

1340240947.0	vcwqu	As drivers use less gas, Florida considers gas-tax replacements	redditswhiledriving	19	1	33	"ST. PETERSBURG -- 

As the public buys more fuel-efficient vehicles and markets for electric and hybrid cars continue to grow, a pair of trends seem to bode well for the environment along with drivers' wallets.

Despite the growth, the state of Florida is concerned about the impact of these trends on its shrinking Transportation Trust Fund, which gets its money from the tax paid-per-gallon of gas purchased by drivers. The money from that fund is then used to pay for highway infrastructure improvements.

""The increase in the number of fuel-efficient vehicles has just exploded,"" said Mark Reichert, the assistant executive director of the Florida Transportation Commission. ""Even though people are starting to drive more, they're trading in their vehicles that got say, 15 to 20 miles to the gallon, for vehicles that get anywhere from 20 to 50 miles per gallon now.""

The less gas pumped, the less money flowing to the Transportation Trust Fund. The State needs to make a change; a change that is fair to everyone.

One option gaining momentum is a mileage-based user fee. The more you drive, the more you pay. Reporting mileage could be as simple as reporting your odometer reading when you renew your tags. ""Or it could be something as sophisticated as ... a GPS system in your vehicle,"" Reichert said.

Such a proposal is sure to raise privacy concerns among drivers. Reichert said technology exists to help mitigate those concerns, but understands the issue is sensitive.

According to Reichert, it could take 5 years or more until any substantial changes are made in the current system.  

Until then, the State will need to find creative ways to keep money going to the Transportation Trust Fund. That could mean an extension of the existing toll system and addition of managed toll express lanes.

I wanted to take a moment to explain what Tampa Free Skool is.

Basically, it is a loosely-knit group of community-oriented people that teach classes to the public, for free, in freely available spaces, such as parks, the library, coffee houses, and our own homes.  Anyone can teach a class on anything in which they have some interest or expertise.

I, for one, have no particular expertise to share, so I've chosen to *facilitate* a few meet-ups, such as an Exquisite Corpse surrealist art group, and a book club (this month we are discussing Frankfurt's *On Bullshit*, and in coming months we'll be focusing on banned books).

We've got a great roster of classes, including yoga, writing, basic computer safety, belly dancing, photography, and a lot more.  And if you have something you'd like to share, you can teach a class. I personally have a wishlist of classes I'd like to take, especially beginner's guitar and anything involving cooking.

If this sounds like something that might be up your alley, you can check Tampa Free Skool out at:

-------------------------------------------------------------

So I thought I would guage the interest of squeezing in another meetup before the end of the year.

The last two or three meetups have been on the Tampa side of the bay.

During the discussion of the last meetup it was requested that the next one be on the otherside of the bay. One problem...I live in Tampa and don't have a clue on where a good place is over on the other side of the water. So St. Pete Redditors...what suggestions do you have?

Criteria - Good beer, good food, parking and lastly a place for us to all congregate together.

I woke up and was on my way out the door at about 11 and as soon as I step outside, a member of the sheriff's office stops me and asks me to go back inside because there is an ""incident."" His partner was laying flat on his stomach with his rifle/gun aimed at the apartment building across the way. 

Does anyone know what's going on? I haven't been able to leave and the apt. complex is going straight to voicemail. In the past hour I've seen two officers not in gear (but with considerable weapons) strolling outside and I saw a guy in full gear go the apartment below me and say ""tell them I'm coming down."" 

Pretty jarring to say the least! Would appreciate any info. if anyone has it, and I'll update accordingly if I learn of anything!

Thanks,
Lakeview Oaks Rez. 

EDIT 1:00 p.m. EST: people just walked by with a Pizza Hut box...but the police are still present...not suer what that means...

EDIT 1:30 p.m. EST: Sheriff office's guys still out there; gave a thumbs up and said we could go out the back but not towards the parking lot; saw a guy over a fence to the adjacent apartment complex setting up some camera equipment; phone line to apt. office still voicemail only; 

EDIT 2:16 p.m. EST: called Hillsborough County Sheriff Operations Center (813-247-8000) and the operator told me that a male had barricaded himself inside another building and the authorities weren't letting people into the complex or to mill about in the lots; she said he had come out and things should be opening up in about 20 minutes

EDIT 2:36 p.m. EST: 20 min. update; still no sign of anything outside; no clearance from authorities; saw a guy walking his dog in the back tho; SWAT-esque guys still in apt., though

EDIT 3:14 p.m. EST: Apt. complex is taking calls again + gave all-clear; front desk said they were talking to authorities about what happened but they didn't know anything other than it was some issue with a resident in one of the buildings; need to go do errands that I couldn't this morning - will call news rooms when I return (or will post/credit any info.

Landlords are stellar people, so I'm trying to help them out		21	5	15	"My landlords are super awesome people and I'm pretty sad to be moving, so I thought I'd help them out and try to find them new renters. They recently moved from Tampa to San Jose, so it's difficult for them to find renters being so far away.

* Located in a gated community near Waters and Armenia in Tampa, this townhouse is 2 bed/2.5 bath with a loft. It is equipped with a own parking space, large kitchen, plenty of counterspace, full size washer and dryer, living room and loft area for extra living space.

* The gated community is VERY quiet and well known neighbors. I have never had a problem living here as a single woman for the past 4.5 years. It's close to many grocery stores, I-275 and Dale Mabry where you can pretty much find anything. There are active bus routes along Waters Ave. as well.

* Rent is $900 and includes water, sewer, trash.

* The townhouse is individually owned, so you would rent from the owners, not a property management company. The application is $50 and the owners do run a background check for criminal and past rental history only, not financial background check. The security depost is a refundable $400. Pets are welcome and appreciated! You have the option to sign a month-to-month lease or sign for multiple months/years. Please email if you'd like more information.

Said they were installers from Orlando and their Job had been cancelled and equipment was paid for and they couldn't take it back. Boss had told them to unload it if they could, otherwise bring it back to him. Mclaren HT81 ""supposedly wireless"" home theater system retailed @ $3495. Digital projector system (didn't catch the name ) retailed for $4000 and projector screen for another $1000. Asked me if I could give them a couple grand for the complete system. I didn't want or need it as I already have a home sytem, plus only had $100 in my wallet. They said they could let the speakers go for $800. I said it might be a great deal, but still only had $100.  They opened the box...all brand new equipment, told me to make sure I send in the warranty card ""as a gift"". Long story short I saw where this was going and left. Googled the speakers when I got home and found out it was a scam. Fun fact, The reason the box feels so heavy is because there is sand in the speakers.

Super cool place with a friendly staff.  They have everything you could ever need for brewing your own beer, wine or even making your own cheese.  They just extended their hours and partnered with a local cafe to offer some food.  They hold home brewing classes every weekend for $25 and it's totally worth it.

***The Room*** is probably the worst movie of the 21st century, so people come to it and yell at the screen and make fun of it. Reasonably priced beverages are consumed. Obscenities are yelled.  Good times are had. 

This is a shadowcast (by the Crazy Random Happenstance), so there will be actors on stage and in the audience, giving you a target for your scorn. So... Please come and yell at the screen and actors as Tommy Wiseau n friends explore love, betrayal, San Francisco, spoons, breast cancer, and roses.

Also, I'm in charge of the sex puppets.

Yes, I know about Red Mesa and their sister restaurant. They're more Cal-Mex than traditional Mexican or Tex-Mex which is what I'm looking for. Plus they're kind of a hike from me (Northdale). Don't get me wrong I'm willing to travel, but it's got to be good. 

I've been to Vallarta's, with the neon tennis ball colored puke they call guacamole. God help me I've also been to Estrella's (blarg!). Mekenita isn't too bad, but that's more nuevo Mexicano. Taco Bus is of course, what it is, but I would consider that more street food than cuisine.

The Beerfest post reminded me to post CCB's other major event coming up on March 9th. 

At the brewery, they will be hosting a release party for their **Hunahpu** mole stout. The party is a big wild wacky affair, kind of a beer-circus, at the brewery. CCB will roll out a ton of special kegs as well as sometimes extremely special kegs from other breweries (last year, they had a keg of Dark Lord, another extremely rare stout from Three Floyds. CCB will start releasing teaser links on their Facebook page in the coming weeks.

Additionally, they'll host other local breweries, and they'll have a section set up for Tampa's homebrew clubs to sling their wares. We're talking about an absolute ton of beer.

Hunahpu is a big, bad, bold beer, and is coveted in the beer-nerd world. 

That said, *I* won't be able to go to Hunahpu's Day, which is the only place and time to get this beer. I woudln't mind having a bottle. If any tampitors are going (you could also use this thread as a meetup organizing thread if you wish) and you think you would pick up an extra (You're allowed either 2 or 3 bottles, depending on when you get there, etc - info is on the CCB page I'll link to), I'd give you the cash for it before the day ($20/bottle) plus buy you a beer or a few *on* the day. So, if you or a friend are going and want to surrender one of your allotted Hunahpus, or if you're going anyway for the home-brews and don't really *want* Hunahpu, but are willing to pick up a bottle or two for a geek like me, the same applies.

Here's the link to the blog post announcing the affair and this year's rules.

It's called Cheese Please and it's located in South Tampa on Manhatten, just south of Euclid.  It's in the same building as Pondscapes, a cute patio store with fountains.

They have a wonderful selection of cheeses as well as jellies and other sides, and they will let you taste any cheese before you buy.  They also do tasting every Friday and Saturday night.  An excellent date night, though they do tend to fill up quick since seating is limited.  My girlfriend and I went to a Cheese and Chocolate tasting one night and got to try out 9 different cheeses paired with various chocolates, nuts, wine and even a plum jelly; it was delightful!  We even discovered a new favorite creamy goat cheese, Capriche de Cabra, and i dont think i can go back to Brie after it.

Give them a looksie sometime!

If you're interested in going, let us know what days work well for you. If you've never been before and want to give it a try this is your chance. I'm always happy to show beginners the ropes. 

It's about $20 for the day. You'll need to pay for entry ($14 all day), shoe rental ($5), and maybe a chalk bag ($2). Friday after 8pm is half price admission for everyone, Tuesday is half off for students, and Wednesday is half off for ladies. 

If you want to do the belayed climbing (with rope and harness), they have a class that includes instruction, all the gear rental you need, AND a return visit for $25 per person for groups of 2 or more, so bring a buddy.

I'll be going this Thursday night with a friend, but if that's too short notice, maybe a day this weekend (or next week) would work better. Saturday afternoon this weekend would also work great.

I was driving northbound on 275 on my way to work. I was in a left lane that flows right into I-4 east.  I see this truck on the far right start changing lanes towards me, i thought surely he would stop but he slammed into the passenger side of my car so hard I started drifting (I have a small Honda civic, he had a ford f-150).  We stop, exchange info, I called the FHP, and they said it will be a while till they show up.  In the mean time road rangers show up and park behind us and keep us company.  The accident happen precisely at 8:53 am (I immediately texted my boss and said I was going to be late), we were there till after 10am waiting for police to arrive - we both got sick of waiting, the individual who hit me told me his insurance will cover it - he gave me the policy number and claim number and we went our separate ways.

After a few hours I get a call from his insurance company and my insurance company to give my statement... Turns out the guy is accusing me of hitting him... So now I'm stuck with having to pay the $500 deductible to fix my car.  

I was looking at some traffic cameras and the one that is on 275 and Ashley that is pointed west would have surely (hopefully) caught the whole thing - if there is any way to get that footage and prove the guy hit me I would be forever greatfull and would spend my saved money buying you a beer!"	t5_2r7ih	True

I would really like to rent a cabin or beachfront and escape life for 4 days.  It's been a tough couple of years with minimal vacation for us, so we would really like something private.  It can be in a city, but no bed and breakfasts or chainy hotels.  With that being said we are flexible.

Any ideas?  Your feedback is greatly appreciated!"	t5_2r7ih	True

I suck at bouldering, but it's a new year and I want to get back in the game and climbing is always more fun with other people.

I'll probably be screwing around on the V1s and Vnuthins because that's how (not) awesome I am at this, but I'm ok at spotting and awesome at moral support.

I'm thinking Wednesday (1/9) around 7? Wednesdays are ladies night, so half off entry if you qualify!

1343055589.0	x0noj	Room for rent in my townhouse!		17	1	6	"Looking for roommate in my townhouse! Located in a gated community near Waters and Armenia in Tampa, this townhouse is 2 bed/2.5 bath with a loft. It is equipped with a own parking space, large kitchen, plenty of counterspace, full size washer and dryer, living room and loft area for extra living space.

The gated community is VERY quiet and well known neighbors. I have never had a problem living here as a single woman for the past 3.5 years. I am looking for someone who is equally quiet, not a partier, generally keeps to themselves, has a stable income and is respectful of my belongings.

Rent is $450 and includes water, sewer, trash. The extras would be electricity (about $40 a month) and internet ($10 a month). I do not have cable, so if you wanted to install cable, that is fine, but you would need to cover the cost of that on your own. I cannot afford cable. You would have your own bedroom and bathroom. The bedroom is fully furnished, but if you would like to bring in your own things, that is fine, I can easily move my things out of the bedroom.

A little about me...I'm 28 years old, have a Masters degree so I am finished with school and partying. I work a M-F stable job and don't really have any friends over. I am dating someone who is over often, so you must be okay with a relationship situation. I have one cat who is very friendly, but does not get along with other animals, so I am saying no to animals. I'm sorry, I just don't want the hassle and added stress with bringing in another animal. I am r/trees friendly.

The townhouse is individually owned, so I rent from the owners, not a property management company. The application is $50 and the owners do run a background check for criminal and past rental history only, not financial background check. You have the option to sign a month-to-month lease or sign for multiple months/years. Looking for someone short-term from now until October 31st as this is when my lease ends, but if everything works out, I would like to stay longer and re-sign another lease.

Please email to set up a time to see the place. I hope to hear from you soon. "	t5_2r7ih	True

We also provide an area for people who like to watch movies or play video games. We also offer free Wi-Fi, chill music for relaxation, and the environment is clean and sanitary (unlike some other lounges in the area).

**Meet-up #1- Tonight, the 10th at 10pm, at Fubar in downtown St Petersburg**

It's my birthday, and what better way to celebrate it than with a bunch of redditors? Starting at 10 tonight (I'll probably be there a little earlier) at 658 Central Avenue I invite you to come rock out to some dubstep at Turbo Tuesday! I previously posted this wrong, it IS 18+ ($5 cover, 21+ $2 cover). I will try and go to wal-mart and get glow sticks to make a reddit alien or some sign or whatever, but if that doesn't happen, just start asking for redditors, hopefully there will be enough of us there! [link for more info](http://www.facebook.com/events/210844459004692/)


**Meet-up #2 Saturday, the 14th at 10pm, at the Dirty Shame in Ybor**

Yeah, we've been to the Dirty Shame a few times, but it's a great starting point for Ybor. We can actually here each other talk over the music, there's free (awesome) dartboards, and they have an outside section as well if it's nice out. I work that night, so I won't be getting there until 10-10:30, but if some of you would like to meet here or elsewhere earlier, post it in the comments or such. We will be at the Dirty Shame until midnight, and after that we will probably wander down to some other bar, so if you plan on joining us later on in the night, let us know here and we can figure out a way to contact you to inform your of our whereabouts. Address is 1929 E. 7th Ave.


**Meet-up #3- Sunday, the 15th, at 1:30pm at Rowlett Park**

A non-bar meet-up was requested, and an outdoor activity sounded fun, so here ya go! We'll meet at [Rowlett Park](http://www.tampagov.net/parks_search_webapp/ParkDetail.aspx?nbr=100) at 1:30pm on Sunday. I was thinking we could do a small fingerfood/snack potluck-ish picnic thing, and then run around and have fun. If you have any footballs, frisbees, bochee sets, lawn darts, BRING THEM! They have trails and such, so get out from behind your computers, bring your kids, and come have some fun in the Florida sun! Let's celebrate the fact that we can go outside in shorts and a t-shirts while our northern friends are shoveling snow and freezing! Send them pictures on facebook and make them jealous! Anyways, I hope to see you there!
**EDIT! I am not actually reserving a shelter for this, but plan to meet at shelter #214. If that's taken, we will either be at 216 or 217. If all 3 are taken, just look for the awkward looking group of pale people.**

Then walk up to the window to find out what's up and I see a guy with headphones on and what looks to be a microphone...LIGHT BULB...Guy Fieri...FoodTV...Diners, Drine-Ins and Dives is there!

I snapped a quick picture of the car with the antique Minnesota license plates in the closed off parking lot (will post tonight when I get home from work).

None of the employees I talked to would say anything other than ""we're closed"". I then ask the woman standing there with the ""sound guy""...""so, ah, I see the Camaro. I see your sound guy, this otherwise 24x7 restaurant is closed in the middle of the day and employees are running around here like chickens with their heads cut off"". She give me a sly grin as if she can't say anything and finally said, ""well you put that together pretty fast. Yes, we are here filming, that's why the parking lot and business are closed.""

The director of the Downtown area told me that MacFarlane is out of the question because the ground floods too often and we'd end up playing on the mud. And Riverfront Park is going to be torn down and rebuilt in the next year. I promptly asked if it was too late to add a volleyball court to the plans and he said he'll pass the request along. He also told me he was going to talk with the higher ups about a third park, I can't recall the park though, but this park used to have a volleyball court. But that once we find the location, we need to figure out funding for it. As far as the court at Curtis Hixon, I need to contact somebody at the Downtown Tampa Partnership.

So I called and spoke with this other gentleman who was very excited that I was asking about the court, since their whole plan was to get people involved. He said he'll talk to Curtis Hixon's staff to see if we can keep the court for a bit longer, but he doubts it, but that he'll be in touch, he wants to help me find a feasible park in downtown for people to play at. At least to set up something temporary. 

I will keep you all updated as this goes along. 

edit: I plan on showing them the [facebook page] (https://www.facebook.com/TampaVolleyball), but to do so I need a bunch of people to follow or like it. Otherwise, with five likes I'm going nowhere. "	t5_2r7ih	True
1374695678.0	1iz7j5	Know any amazing yet affordable day spas like in the movies?	ParadiseBen	17	1	14	My fiance's birthday is coming up, and she's never had a spa day, like you see in the movies - with the hot stones, and massages and cucumber water and waterfalls, white doves flying around etc.? Does anyone know of where I can send her to just relax for a few hours?? Preferably on the water?	t5_2r7ih	True
1374683497.0	1iyq6w	Sup guys, I'm making my way to Tampa from Dallas Texas on motorcycle and would love to hang out with some of you dudes.	El_Zombie	19	3	45	"Hey guys, as the title says I'm making my way to Florida next week. I'll be coming in via Motorcycle and checking out some stuff as I've never been to the east side of America before. I have absolutely no friends or family in the area (which is weird because I'm half Mexican/Cuban) So I'm looking for people to hang out with and grab a bite to eat. Maybe check out the beach since I've never been.

I honestly have no plan other than to stick my face in the sand and be happy I've made it to your city. So I am completely up to do whatever you guys suggest or want to do. Hopefully you can suggest a great museum to go to.

Some stuff about me: I'm 22 Years old but my beard makes me look like I'm 30 (I've been told). I'll be staying in the area for a few days. I would love to go to the beaches and do Tampa stuff. I have no idea what consists of Tampa stuff but I did check out your sidebar. Maybe we can do one of the things suggested there? I have no place to stay, so I'll be looking out for one, being a motel or some friendly people. Also, if you'd like my Facebook please PM me. Hopefully it can prove I'm a chill dude, lol.

I look forward to reading your responses and hopefully some people can come hang out. Thanks for reading.

I don't have work or anything lined up so I'm looking at having a lot of free time in the near future. Don't know a soul in this town and don't really have any way to meet them. Browsed through meetup.com, not much of a club/group person. I would prefer to just meet people one on one or in a small group setting. I'm laid back, willing to do just about anything. I love Buffy, playing Sims, Reddit, socializing.. I'm available most of the time since I don't have a job. I'm down to go walking, fishing, get coffee, get drinks or whatever in the hell you feel like dragging me along to partake in.

Take a stand against NSA/Prism.	thegrandpas	16	2	25	"Recently news broke out that the NSA has been monitoring and recording phone calls, emails, and even Facebook messages made by US citizens. It's not only a gross violation of privacy, but also a breach of the 4th Amendment of the Constitution.

A grass roots movement has sprung up from Reddit called Restore the Fourth! People all over the country are gathering on July 4th in protest of the NSA’s surveillance system Prism, the Patriot Act, and demand government transparency.

Come be a part of history and stand up for not only Americans, but for people everywhere.
