1364027829.0	1aunae	Thank you FFX	Computer-Player	374	63	41	"I just moved into my new place not too long ago. as it was, I was organizing some of my stuff. Unpacking stuff from boxes and taking out some of my old game systems/games and among the pile was FFX. 

There was a knock at the door. I was expecting someone to show up so I didn't bother looking through the peep hole. Big Mistake.

Now there's one thing you need to know about me and that is that I am unable to say ""no"" to door to door salesmen and the like, so if they were trying to sell me perfume or something and they already started their spiel, I'm trapped.

When I opened the door, instead of seeing whom I thought was at the door I was greeted by a couple of Jehovah Witnesses. They both appeared in their late 50's to early 60's. They started talking about how their congregation is looking for new people to attend their sermons and what not. and then they asked me (since I was alone) if I belonged to a church.

My thinking
""Okay Brain, do something!""

What I ended up saying
""Yes, I do actually (adrenaline starts kicking in, thanks brain). I belong to the Church of Yevon.""

A puzzled look in her face
""I've never heard of that church before.""

""Well as a Yevonite, our goal is to rid the world of Sin through non-use of Machina (Machines) and lots of Prayer.""
Since my new place was empty it really helped me convince them that I was super devote.
""As a matter of fact, what time is it?""

""12:15""

""I'm actually late for a prayer, would you care to join?""
""Not really.""
I began the [Hymn of the Fayth](http://youtu.be/TWVST7P37IM) anyways (I loved FFX, and heard it enough times to know it by heart)

""Now traditionally, I think you guys do a sign of the cross when you finish a prayer, but in Yevon we spread our arms inward and bow"" http://youtu.be/usAUSLe0ziw?t=9m42s

Needless to say they didn't care what the hell I was doing as long as I would show up to their church. I played this as straight as I could, they gave me a pamphlet and left me be.

tl;dr I trolled a couple of Jehovah's Witnesses with a straight face about belonging to the Church of Yevon"	t5_2qhdi	True

1358829261.0	171cbs	Dear r/FinalFantasy....	partytillidei	311	46	71	"
When I was a teenager I was the only person in my neighborhood playing Squaresoft games. Final Fantasy 2 and 3, Chrono Trigger, Secret of Evermore, Secret of Mana. These were games that I treasured but I never really had anyone to share my love for them, most of my friends were playing Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat (both great games too). Now I am all grown up and I see the RPGs that I spent my teenage years playing werent just a hobby that I played alone. There are millions of us. 

In college I identified myself with the ""nerd"" crowd but I still felt like I didn't fit in. They knew every single quote from Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, and Star Trek and I had no one that would understand what a ""spoony bard"" was. I was an outcast among outcasts. 

I remember being bored in class and drawing my own little ""world map"" in the back of my notebook with my favorite towns from Squaresoft video games placed throughout the world, I remember writing a report in school on how RPG players are different than other video game players, I mean....there is no doubt that all that text we read as kids has improved our grammar and spelling. My teacher just didnt get different genres of video games and once again I felt like an outcast.

But I just want to say THANK YOU, I feel like I am no longer weird, I went to the Distant Worlds concert and saw people getting teary eyed when they played Aeris Theme, I saw people cosplaying as Kefka at Comic Con and quoting him, and now I see you guys on r/FinalFantasy debating, quoting, painting, laughing with, and just praising the greatest video game series of all time. 

I just want to say thank you for making me feel normal. :)

Backstory: a friend of mine really liked the storyline to FF7, but said that the poor character models (and his lack of time to play) had prevented him from really getting into the game. So I ventured to make FF7 more cinematic.

I modded the look of the characters, replaced much of the soundtrack (with orchestrated versions or songs from movie soundtracks) and expanded upon certain sections of dialog. Altogether I recorded and re-edited the game into a six hour film.

EDIT: [Here's a good example of one of the bigger edits I made](http://youtu.be/ot_VOgbgWMs?t=1h41m8s), the fall of Sector 7.

1374771999.0	1j1dsh	My girlfriend and I notice something awesome about the beginning of Final Fantasy IX.	Galwither	144	44	40	"I thought this subreddit would appreciate this little story...

My girlfriend and I recently started playing Final Fantasy IX. She has never had any interest in video games whatsoever, and for a while was pretty adamant about them being pretty horrible wasteful past times. One thing we both really enjoy are beautiful and engaging stories. So I wanted to show her the beautiful side of video games, and that not all games are like Call of Duty. She was nervous about playing it at first, but the beautiful images and how the story is presented to the player piqued her curiosity. I made some dinner for the both of us, and we started playing.

We then got to the part of the game where you play as Vivi for the first time, whom she adamantly name ""Tumpkin."" We had our ticket in hand to see the play, and arrived at the ticket booth to be let inside only to realize the ticket was a fake. The ticket booth guy told her to go to the alleyway and talk to the Rat Man. So we did, and we came across this little rat-boy. He said he would help only if I became his slave. My gamer instint said to just say yes, but my girlfriend said ""No I don't want to be that little thing's slave."" So out of curiosity I declined his offer and he ran off and left us alone. We spent the next twenty minutes exploring the plaza talking to people, and trying to find a way to get into the play, but to no avail. Then we made a discovery about the game. She looked up at me as I was running back through the plaza and said ""I'm so lost and confused."" Then it hit me like a ton of bricks. Here in this game we have Vivi (Tumpkin) who is an outcast in a world that doesn't seem to care about him because of his differences, he is ""lost and confused"" and the game had succeeded in making us feel the same emotion that this little pixelated mage was feeling. We looked at each other in awe of what a simple video game could do. She smile at me, and said ""Ok, I really like this game, can we keep playing? I want to see what happens."" So we continued playing, and have kept playing and both of us are having a great time."	t5_2qhdi	True

1371831369.0	1gsv1k	For fans of Smash Bros. and Final Fantasy: I need your help/ideas/input/etc...	anoddsoul	114	19	77	"I'm putting together a comprehensive list of move sets, with the future goal of making a huge roster of FF characters, playable in hacked versions of Smash Bros. The ultimate goal is to create more of these:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86W58q9pDdY

The move sets that have been completed so far are as follows: Cloud, Tifa, Barrett, Aeris, Nanaki, Cait Sith, Cid Highwind, Yuffie, Vincent (but not his D-Pad transformations into Chaos, Beast, Gigas, and Hellmasker), Sephiroth, Squall, Rinoa, Quistis, Irvine, Zell, Selphie, Ultimeca, Laguna, Kiros, Seifer, Vivi, Zidane, Rajin, Fujin, Wakka, Noel, Caius, Loz, Sabin, Setzer, Auron, Reno, and Genesis.

Also, before I get the inevitable response ""Isn't that what Dissidia is for?"" let me say that the Smash Bros style presents a unique play format/otherwise, yeah, Dissidia would do the trick.

If you're interested in helping, here's what I need:

1.	Standard A
2.	A + A + A quick attacks
3.	Dash Attack
4.	A + Up Smash
5.	A + Up Smash (Fully Charged) (Optional)
6.	A + Side Smash
7.	A + Side Smash (Fully Charged) (Optional)
8.	A + Down Smash
9.	A + Down Smash (Fully Charged) (Optional)
10.	Directional Smash + Same Direction A (On some Characters only) (Optional)
11.	Standard B
12.	Standard B (Air)
13.	B + Up
14.	B + Up (Air) (Only different than B + Up on some Characters)
15.	B + Down
16.	B + Down (Air)
17.	B + Side
18.	B + Side (Air)
19.	A + Up Tilt
20.	A + Down Tilt
21.	A + Forward Tilt
22.	A + Diagonal Up/Down Tilt (On some Characters only) (Optional)
23.	Neutral A Air
24.	Forward A Air
25.	Upward A Air
26.	Downward A Air
27.	Backward A Air
28.	Grab + A
29.	Throw + Up
30.	Throw + Down
31.	Throw + Side
32.	Throw + Back
33.	Edge Attack
34.	Edge Attack (Above 100%)
35.	Final Smash
36.	D Pad Taunts/Transformations
37.	Unique Jumps, Grabs, Abilities (i.e. Floating), Levitation Stances, etc… If any. (Optional)

-Any of these items marked ""optional"" are just extra game mechanics that are available. 

-Make the attacks make sense, in keeping with the Smash Bros format. (i.e. If a character like Yuffie uses the super shuriken to slash for her ""Standard A"" attack, but can throw it forward with ""Side + B,"" she shouldn't be able to move or attack until the shuriken comes back to her).

-Final Smashes do not need to be their most powerful attack from their respective FF game. For instance, Sephiroth, as he stands now, can summon a (scaled down) Black Materia meteor by simply pressing and holding ""Standard B"". Also, try to make their Final Smashes something fluid (an attack they can just fluidly release after going above a certain percentage, instead of going after a smash ball, think Link's ""Triforce Slash"") and less one-hit-kill cataclysmic (make it powerful, but not this ***IS*** going-to-kill-everyone-on-the-stage,-possibly-multiple-times-once-I-release-it powerful)

-If a character has parentheses next to their name, it is usually an indication that they should be able to transform into an alternate character with the D-Pad.

-Finally, here is a list of the many, many characters that still need move sets (I am excluding NPC characters from XI and XIV, though many of them would make good editions, so feel free to do those if you're so inclined).

1365922928.0	1cbday	Observation while replaying FFVII with a grownup perspective	lilkuniklo	120	20	41	"I was just a kid when I fell in love with FFVII. Everything about it blew my mind. But I never expected that the characters would continue to resonate with me after all these years. I recently made that discovery when I started another playthrough, this time with an adult's perspective.

I didn't expect anything from this playthrough. Even though it's been 10 years since the last time I played it, I still remembered everything about this game. The only reason why I wanted to replay it again was because I just wanted something I was completely familiar with to help unwind.

Everything went as usual until I got to the part where Nanaki discovers the truth about his father's sacrifice. When the music swelled and Seto's statue started to cry, I goddamn lost it. I am rarely ever emotional, but here I was, weeping. 

It was completely unexpected. I already knew this was coming, why was I so affected? Then I realized that my perspective is completely different now that I'm an adult. There was no way my childhood mind could have fully appreciated what's going on in this moment.

The scene with Nanaki and Seto really hit home what I've come to realize about my own dad over the years. I'm 26 now. I've only begun to understand the many sacrifices my father has made for me. I never appreciated his actions when I was younger and often took his kindness for granted. 

Now that I'm finally old enough to understand, I'm simultaneously realizing my own father's mortality. He's still the same kind man he's always been, but he's getting older, slower, achier, and starting to develop health problems. When you're a kid, you think your father is invincible. Then you grow up and realize that he's going to die someday, and you start to have feelings of regret about not being nicer and spending more time with your old man when you were young and had all the time in the world. And you get feelings of guilt about giving him so much shit and saying mean things when you were an ignorant, unappreciative kid.

It took me a while to kind of ""process"" the emotions that the Seto scene stirred up in me. But, goddamn, what an incredible game FFVII still is after all of these years. It's only gotten better with age.

FFVIII was released in my native United States on 9/9/1999. I was 12 years old at the time, and as anticipatory as an fanboy could be. My parents had bought me FFVII on a lark a year before, and have (somewhat) regretted that decision ever since. 

When the game came out, I remember seeing a lot of disappointed condemnation of the game on its release, and I still see a lot of it here on r/FF. I'm not saying the criticisms aren't appropriate! FFVIII wasn't FFVII. Moreover, the FFVIII is a very heterodox FF. There's a number of departures from the series' standards; no MPs, no limit to summons per battle, enemies level with the characters, etc. But, I want to elucidate a bit on why FFVIII is close to my heart, and perhaps why it should be close to yours as well.

FFVIII is about love. A lot happens in the game's four discs, but ultimately, I think Kazushige Nojima, Yoshinori Kitase, and Tetsuya Nomura were trying to tell a story about love. I know that sounds really hokey - in many ways it is! 

Like I said earlier, I was 12 years old when I first played the game. My understanding of love was pretty shallow - shaped more by CloudxTifa fanfics written by fanboys who knew as much about the emotion as I did - than actual experiences with people close to me. I'm re-playing the game now; a 24-year-old man with a few ""serious"" relationships, a handful sputtering failures, one major heartbreak and, thankfully, a better understanding of what friendship is.

FFVIII is an important addition to the series because it helps unpack vulnerable feelings and tender moments. I'm not sure if gamers as a group or even RPG gamers specifically; are the best or most appropriate audience for a story about love, or an examination of tender moments. But I argue that FFVIII possess a longevity, a durability, that other games (and other FFs) lack. Built on it's capacity to connect the very human experiences of loss, vulnerability, connection and (maudlin as it may be) love; to the broader ""epic story"" the FF game is expected to portray.

Final Fantasy X really is the best Final Fantasy yet, and one of the greatest games of all time.

From the development of the characters, the settings, the bosses, and even the small things such as the Al Bhed language, it is more than fair to say that this game was worth the 3 years it took to make. I've never played a game that had me so involved, like I actually CARED for these characters and I followed the story as if I was IN it. My only regret is that I can't play it over and over. 

I'm more than willing to discuss the game and your opinions as I fairly enjoy even just talking about this game, so criticism is welcomed.

I've seen how they all end (except for 12) so when I play them, I'm not super interested in finishing them so much as the gameplay and finding all the hidden items throughout. Well, I've had a saved game of FF7 at the northern crater for forever (probably 5 years). I've got my gold chocobo, all the limit breaks, all the ultimate weapons. Cloud is level 99 and everyone else is in the 90s. So today, I finally decided to just finish it.

For years it is all I have heard about; ""We want FF Versus XIII, cut it out with the Lightning crap!"" Well, here it finally is, and what do we get? Complaints. Now I realize that many of you are absolutely thrilled with the announcement, as am I. But through a combination of Youtube, Facebook and other networks, including Reddit, I have become seriously disappointed in FF fans. Yes, Final Fantasy is changing as it slowly steps away from it's JRPG roots with each new game. The thing is, change is a GOOD. If these games hadn't been evolving, the franchise would more than likely died off quite some time ago. What you all wanted is finally here, why isn't it enough? I for one am thrilled it wasn't cancelled all together. Can we all please enjoy what we get and be excited together? Square Enix deserves better.

tl;dr - Yes FFXV is different. You should be happy you get to play as Noctis at all."	t5_2qhdi	True

I worship Uematsu as a god, and just generally love Final Fantasy music.  Having said that, I just wanted to know if there is anyone out there like me who loves FF music in general but who dislikes the songs with vocals ([Eyes on Me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNefNLOHVYk), [Suteki da Ne](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlwSPMwAqbM), etc).  For some reason I cannot get into them.  I've noticed that most fans do not feel the same way as me.  In FF8, I hate the scene on the Ragnarok when Rinoa sits on squall on the bridge (Eyes on Me plays).  In FFX (my personal favorite, controversial I know) I think the water scene in Macalania is beautiful but the music makes me cringe.  Just wanted to start a discussion and get some others' opinions.

Having said that, the exception to my rule is [Radical Dreamers - Unstolen Jewel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkKMUrEOnwc) from Chrono Cross.  I just think it's a beautiful song.  Then, I also tend to favor Yasunori Mitsuda's OSTs.

(Optional I guess)Also, to keep things interesting, what are your top three favorite songs from any Final Fantasy OST?

1373142192.0	1hrk71	FFX, alternative path for Lulu	tedtutors	83	11	58	"Lulu is a great story character, but by the middle of the game a lot of players have dropped her out of active combat play - black magic isn't really critical to FFX and she doesn't have any other major skills besides magic buffs.  At first she is there to pop the occasional flan, but once you've got a few element-enhanced weapons that's not really needed either.  And her overdrive is the worst idea in the game, barely doing more damage than a normal spell.

So here's an alternative, for those who don't like leaving a character idle in the roster: Lulu as status ailment striker.  She's good at this for a few reasons: her grid is close to Wakka's, just a couple of Lvl 1 keys spheres apart.  She has lots of MP, so 2-3 silence/dark attacks per encounter pose no problems.  And if you don't work on her strength right away, she's not likely to kill the target.  Bonus, you get to watch her moogle doll or Cait Sith run up to bap a fiend.

Why bother? If you are playing a ""gang of thieves"" style game where you want every steal, delaying the fiends' inevitable demise is important, and so is minimizing damage to the party.  You need someone to dark the armored menace / silence the flan or imp, while the thief gets in the first steal and the hitter takes it out.

I'm playing this one now, and it's a lot of fun.  Also provides our beleaguered Ronso friend with something to do - Kimari can get to the Steal ability early in the game, well before you acquire Rikku.  Meanwhile everyone else is turning into awesome hitter/healer/speedy goodness."	t5_2qhdi	True

However, I was in a debate in another forum and I posted this little tidbit. I was surprised at what I wrote and thought it ended up being a good outlook at the game. It is response to FF15 being a ARPG. 

{ I would like to chime in here. I have been playing Final Fantasy since 1, I played it 1990 and was only 6 years old. I have played EVERY FF game since then. This includes spin off titles like Choco Dungeon, and even Ehrgeiz. Also play FF11 and still play it till today AND played FF14 beta til shut down and in current beta for FF14: ARR. I have beat every MAIN ff title at least 2 times and some way more, (14 times for FF7).

And I would like to say I have no issue with FF15 being a ARPG. Quite frankly I don't understand why anyone would. Each FF is different especially after 10. 1-3 and 10 where the only TRUE turn based FF games. 4-9 had the ATB system which was not really turned based. It was a hybrid of some type. Then we have 11,12 and 14 which are all MMORPG like games. They are more like action games. Especially 14, its very action like with its game-play. 13 system was another hybrid of the ATB system, getting even closer to the action side.

I just don't see the issue with the game being action based. It drives home the fact every FF is different. How many FF fans grew to like FF because of 7? 8? 10? and even 13? Yes even 13 brought a shit ton of new fans to the FF series. This is what makes FF so great. Each game appeals more to another person. For example, FF9 is one of my least fave FF's, but it is BELOVED by many. FF7 is my fave but it is HATED by many.

FF is a theme, not a genre. I think will enjoy FF15 and I hope others will too. }"	t5_2qhdi	True

1336708219.0	thnv6	Okay, I'll admit it: I'm LOVING FFXIII!	stopthefate	91	19	65	"So a few months ago, I BLEW through 8 FF games, (III,IV,VI,VII,VIII,IX,X,XII) so this is my first time playing through 13. Having played so many in such a short amount of time, (and most except 7 and 9 for the first time at that) I think I'm in a pretty unique position when it comes to comparing the evolution and gameplay of these games.

Now obviously I agree that the ""golden era"" games (6-9) were the best, but I loved 12. The battle system was just so different and fun to me.

In my eyes, 13's is extremely similar to 12.

Now before you go WTF you talkin' bout STF, let me say that, yes, you can move in 12's system, but the differences really end there.

The whole issue that Square had when going into 12 and beyond was that people were growing tired of the slow turn-based system of classic rpgs. To remedy this, auto-battle has taken over to the chagrin of many gamers. I LOVE the battle system of the classic games, but to me, the unique systems of 12 and 13 are just as fun.

For one thing, the speed, (the whole point of the new systems) really shows the current state of video gaming and its fast pace and immediate action/reaction. Furthermore, to me the system is like a symphony where you are a conductor and your characters are like the orchestra. There IS strategy, the game is not ""playing itself"". Essentially the system is simply put in place to make things move faster without the static, unrealistic looking battles of yore. You have sets that you create, (whether we're talking about gambits in 12 or paradigm shifts in 13) and they basically contain the move-sets you would use.

Now though, the characters can use them simultaneously allowing for quicker battles and since you only control one character at a time, you can think about your specific moves while still controlling the overall tone of the battle with gambits or paradigms.

Now besides the battle system (I've loved them all since FF6 I have to admit the classic job system from 5 and 3 irks me) I don't mind the linearity. I guess going in I knew it would be linear so I didn't expect anything else. For me, the game is like a story-book whereas 12 was like a political open-world for me to explore. 13 was an intricate tale that wrapped me up in the lives of its characters (I hate you Hope you whiny bitch) and to add to the interesting story, the linearity actually made me want to keep going. Knowing that I didn't have to keep an ever-growing log of back-tracks and side quests to remember in my head made me excited to see ""what comes next"". Then when the worlds opens up, I have a full handle on everything that's going on, and I'm ready to diverge paths about.

Needless to say I'm psyched to play 13-2 and excited to see where the series heads.

Finally, for all of those worrying that ""FF is doomed for good"", I mean c'mon, they change it up so much now-adays I just don't think that's a fair statement at all."	t5_2qhdi	True

Seeing all these other developers showing their stuff, all I can think is why did Square even bother to show up? A trailer from last year and a man who looks like he's about to have a stroke saying that a game is coming out? I sure as fuck hope so since you're a game developer. Goddammit.

Edit: The next time someone makes one of those ""video game companies as friends"" thing, Square Enix is the guy that always says he's going to hang out, and never does. You 2 grew up together, being inseparable at times, but now he's a total flake. He keeps promising awesome times, but they never come, and the last time you guys hung out he ended up freaking out but he [promised he'd work on that](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_fantasy_14), [~~twice~~](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XIII-2), [three times](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Returns:_Final_Fantasy_XIII). Now he just [shows you brochures of really awesome places to go](http://www.psu.com/a018331/Final-Fantasy-X-HD-still-exists-Square-shows-off-remodeled-characters-in-PS-Vita-webcast), and is even so bold as to have you [pay for a ticket to go somewhere that doesn't even exist](http://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-Versus-XIII-Playstation-3/dp/B000ZK9QBY).

1343789798.0	xhhqv	Let's have a mature conversation here. What particular aspect(s) do you dislike about each Final Fantasy title?	heymrk	71	14	115	"*Let's try and do this without the downvote brigade coming out. Without petty bickering over the best Final Fantasy or even which one you think is the best, let's have a legitimate, mature discussion on the things we find issue with in this series.*

*Remember, be objective about the opinions of others here. Don't downvote them because they criticized your favorite game. If you want to reply, do it constructively and hopefully with more than just an arbitrary downvote.*

I'll go first:

* **FF1:** I really have nothing bad to say about this game, other than the bosses are relatively easy, as compared to *getting* to the bosses.

* **FF2:** You might think I'd say the leveling system, but I actually like the idea. I don't want to see it again, but not because I don't like it, but because it was unique to FF2. My biggest problem with the game was the keyword system's interaction with the story. The keyword concept is pretty cool, but in the grand scheme of the story, it simply falls short. There's a reason I've only played through the game once-- because I continually get lost. Other FF titles, I can leave for a while and pick back up later on. This is not the case with FF2. If you lose your place in the story, it's hard to get back into it.

* **FF3:** I hate that if you want to play an official licensed version of this game, it's in 3D. No particular grievance with the game itself, but I really, *really* want Square Enix to release a 16-bit version, a la FF Origins.

* **FF4:** Edward Damycan. I know he was made better in FF4 DS, but I've never played it. He is probably the most worthless character in all of FF, *to me.*

* **FF5:** You can't go wrong with a job system game. While not quite as polished as FFT, it's still a great game. The story is tight and cohesive, but I hate that if you've got a couple of key classes mastered, you can beat the game with levels in the mid-30s to 40s. I think there's a scalability issue with this game. I would prefer to be in the high 60s by the end of the game. This is nitpicky, and the same degree of difficulty would be there regardless of the level, but just irked me personally.

* **FF6:** Hoo-boy. This is my favorite FF title. I love it for many reasons, but I absolutely cannot stand Gau. Now, I know there are guides out there that can make him god-awesome early in the game, but the rage system simply felt broken to me. I *love* blue magic/monster skills, but in more of a traditional aspect, like Strago's blue magic. Plus Strago's blue magic can't break the game, like a few of Gau's rages can.

* **FF7:** Here's where I think I'm going to get the wrath. I don't like the Cloud/Sephiroth dynamic. Is Cloud in love with him? Is it hero worship? Is it the Jenova cells? Is it unmitigated hatred? There's no concrete line in the game clearly defining why he's following Sephiroth. Is it all of the above all at once? Why does their relationship seem so creepy? Maybe that's the thing most people like about their relationship-- because it's ambiguous. It forces you to make your own judgments and keeps people discussing it, even 15 years later. It just bugged me. Tell me *exactly why* their relationship is what it is.

* **FF8:** This is my second favorite FF title. It's hard to pick something-- if anything-- wrong with this title. But I think I know what it is. I like magic. I mean, I absolutely *love* breaking this game. I can make it to Ultimecia's castle with no single character higher than about level 15. That's one of the things I love the most about it-- to me, it's an anti-RPG. I love the GF and battle system, but I wish there were some way other than with Selphie and Quistis' limit breaks to use magic consistently. It's definitely more hack-n-slash than any other FF title because of the magic system, but I still like it. I just wish there was more of a way to use magic without depleting your stats.

* **FF9:** I don't like Necron. Sure, I love plot twists. Just when you think it's over, you get dragged right back in. At least in FF10 there was some allusion to Yu Yevon before you defeated Jecht. Not to mention, there was plenty of opportunity to introduce Necron in the final dungeon. Add some wall placards warning about the destruction of the crystal. It's not that hard. It's shoddy storytelling. Give at least *some* foreshadowing.

* **FF10:** I don't like Tidus. There's a lot of emotion wrapped up in that one. A lot of personal anxiety because of it. My dad wanted me to be the balls-to-the-wall football star he was in high school and college. I didn't want that. He berated me constantly because I didn't want to do pee wee football. I did track &amp; field (and even helped win a state championship), but to him, that running was for ""pussies""-- not even a sport. I can also play three musical instruments, but to him, that was gay. The problem I encounter with Tidus is when I was 12 or 13, I simply told my dad to fuck off. Well, not with those words, but still. Tidus always pissed me off because he got all the way to adulthood without telling his dad where to shove it. I won't say my relationship with my dad is perfect, but now he respects me for the decisions I've made in my life. Tidus simply never manned up. Just grow a pair, man. Please.

* **FF12:** I really LOVE this game. It's my third favorite of them all. But my biggest problem with the game was how apparently absent Vayne was. We know he's amassing his power behind the scenes, and having the party not meet him until the end of the game was a *powerful* choice to make. I like that aspect, but it seemed like while Cid was doing all the dirty work, Vayne was just chilling in Archades, waiting on his time to come. Why can't we see more of his descent into madness?

* **FF13:** The pacing. Sure, it's got a good story-- one that I didn't come to enjoy until the second time around-- but the story's pace moves too quickly. Give me an opportunity to feel like I can catch my breath. Let me stop for a minute to give my brain an opportunity to process what I just went through. Please.

* **FF10-2:** Not a bad game. I'm not even going to say the problem is the super J-pop story. My problem is the tedious task of getting every single miniscule tenth of a percentage point in order to get 100% at the end. It drove me batty.

* **FFT:** The translation. I know it was fixed with *War of the Lions,* but I don't own it.

**TL;DR**: *FF1,* boss difficulty. *FF2,* keywords. *FF3,* GBA release. *FF4,* Edward. *FF5,* low level requirements. *FF6,* Gau. *FF7,* Cloud and Sephiroth. *FF8,* no magic. *FF9,* Necron. *FF10,* Tidus. *FF12,* Vayne. *FF13,* the pacing. *FF10-2,* the percentage points. *FFT,* translation.

I reflected a bit on my video gaming and realized that I spent a ton of time playing FFX. I wrote a quick blog post (with screenshots!) about my biggest time sink: http://markcerqueira.com/2013/07/12/time-sinks---final-fantasy-x/

FFX was my 4th FF (after 8, 7, and 9) and I absolutely loved it. I completed all the side quests and even ""rewrote"" the Sphere Grid to max out my characters' stats (except Luck for some reason). I only played through it twice, but am very much looking forward to playing it again when the HD remaster comes out!

What's been your biggest FF time sink?

My first play through some time ago, I honestly had no idea what was going on until somewhere around the second disk. I didn't really care for how I was led around by the nose, and there was no exploring to be had. I thought the characters themselves were to inflated (for instance, Snow the 'Hero' or Hope the 'Emo' Kid)


-This time is different though. Knowing the outcome of the story, I am really paying attention to the field dialogue and cut scenes, and now, it makes so much more sense. 


My first time through, after I got down the paradigm system, the game had little challenge to it, it was so fast paced. I went back through FF VII and found myself annoyed out how long battles were drawn out (still the story is stellar, epic), even with the ATB Active. 
I also, started back over on XII, just to see what I liked about it. This is where I found my ultimate conclusion: XIII has the *epicness* of VII, with a splash of every battle system combined, with the little annoyances of past titles, eliminated.

I didn't draw this conclusion lightly. I have been playing and enjoying since '92 with my first title being II for SNES (I got it when I got my SNES) and going back and buying the original two for NES. 

Lightning may be a hard nosed soldier (bitch, if you will) But she is no more a bitch than Cloud is a straight-up jerk for the majority of the first disk.

On a side note, Squall (sorry guys) reminds me of the vampire from Twilight, now. As I attempted to watch Twilight with my wife (I think I deserve an award, got 27 minutes in before I couldn't watch anymore) I somehow made that connection, but it's stuck now.  "	t5_2qhdi	True

So I'm playing through VIII, working my way through Disc 3 on my release day copy, on my PS2.

I'm [in the escape pod on the Lunar Base going through the sequence where Squall saves Rinoa while she's floating out in space](/spoiler).  Problem is, the FMV [where she activates the reserve tank](/spoiler), craps out right at the end, not allowing me to progress.

So for those of you who haven't gone through it, it's a 20 minute long scripted event, with a Save Point right before, and a Save Point after.

I tried everything.

* Cleaning the disc  
* Cleaning the laser eye
* Setting the PS2 to Fast Disc Read Speed (by the way, smooth texture mapping is kinda cool)   
* Dusting off my old modded PSX, and trying it there
* Using Toothpaste, and then Brasso to polish the disc
* Copying the disc using error correction software, and burning a new copy
* Finding a video rental place near my house and taking it there to get professionally polished, and then attempted to burn a new copy after I had it polished

Nothing worked.  I had ordered a new copy of the game (a greatest hits copy) from Amazon, but it hadn't been sent yet.

Then I remembered something.  When I had first modded my PSX back in roughly 2001, I had a friend with a CD Writer make me a bunch of copies of my games, as backups.  Luckily for myself, I'm a bit of a pack-rat when it comes to burned discs.

I dug through the basement for about an hour, and found a stack of CD's that contained my back-up copies of Tactics, and V-IX.  There it was. Final Fantasy VIII, Disc 3.  I flipped it over, and my heart dropped.  

Scratched like a motherfucker. 

Nevertheless, I'm going to try it.  Maybe the section that I need is okay.

I trek upstairs, pop open the PSX, and realize the spring that lets me do a disc swap (I need a legit disc to start the PSX, then swap it before it fully loads) has gone missing in the time I'd been away.

I pull apart several pens trying to find one that has the strength and the size to work.  No luck.

So, I get down on the floor, and prop the PSX on my lap, sitting inches from the TV.  I take one of the pens, and prepare myself to hold the close-lid button down for the entire sequence.  

Each of the FMV's in the sequence plays, albeit choppy, each pause in the video has me convinced it's not going to play, while my hand is going numb from the pressure I'm putting on the pen to hold down the button.

Here it comes.  [Rinoa wakes up.  The music changes, and she activates the Reserve Tank.](/spoiler) The video sputters, then continues.  Then it hangs up.  

Five seconds go by.

Then it starts, and finishes.  In my joy I almost pulled my hand off the button, but I finish the scene, and save the game.  

Just to be sure that it works, I pop the original into my PS2, and fire up the save.  It does.

My fiancee, not being a gamer, gave me the ""uhh, great?"" response when I recounted my struggle this weekend, but I figure you guys would understand better than she would.

Any of you guys have any similar stories?

**TL;DR:  Tried everything over the entire weekend to get a disc to play. After 2 days, it finally works.**

1338355274.0	ubowc	On the subject of Final Fantasy XIII		70	23	65	"In response to the poorly drafted Final Fantasy XIII post, here is a better thought out expansion. To begin with: Story.

The story of Final Fantasy XIII is rivaled only by a few, namely VII and VI (In my mind, anyway). Instead of the traditional ""You have a party, you meet more people, party grows, kill something, crystal, end game surprise"", you have an original story where 6 people of different walks of life (Much like V honestly) are thrust into each other by a seal on there soul, and *MUST* complete the mission at hand not only for them, but for the good of the world. Also, it is really meant to play as a movie. The linearity is necessary as it amplifies the entire storyline. If you did not have the linear exploration, some elements might be missed, and the entire game may have holes by end-game. 

Secondly, the game play was vastly improved over other FF titles. Instead of actively controlling your entire party (Or in recent games, one character), you must coordinate the party through job classes, and control your character while planning out which attack to use and if it will affect surrounding enemies as well. The amount of time taken for battles may annoy some people, but I believe its to ensure that your willing to take the time to beat the game rather than just play off and on in short bursts, so you can really get into the story. Plus, summons are quite a bit more fun to use, since every character has their own personal Eidolon reflecting themselves in some way, and Gestalt mode is a very excellant new mechanic allowing for each summon to show their strength.

Third, for those who complain it strays from tradition, you forget the Archyllite Steppe reintroduces the old mechanics in a new way, with over 100 C'ieth Stones acting as side quests. It also does away with linearity for a while, even though it takes a while to reach this point. And while a true city isn't located in the game, the save points act as an interface for cities, giving almost all the basic utilities of the cities in older games, minus the Inn. Although it may turn a few people away, it doesn't mean the traditional mechanics are completely gone, just that they are there in spirit.

TL;DR: While FFXIII doesn't have the feel of a Final Fantasy game, it still is one, just in a new light. It reinvents every mechanic of older games in some way, and should be held in regard to every other FF game."	t5_2qhdi	True
