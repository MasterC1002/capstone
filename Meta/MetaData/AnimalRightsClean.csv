1304573499.0	h4lx8	Animal Sacrifice in Children's Sermon [x-post from Animal Welfare]	Maevrim	297	85	115	"Sunday morning in Russiaville (Indiana), [I removed the church name in case that was against protocol] featured a children's sermon by the main pastor, entitled “Finding Nemo.” In this sermon, he used 200 “feeder fish,” an assortment of easy-to-raise fish such as goldfish and guppies, to make a point to the children of his congregation. The point was that they cared more for “15¢ fish” than the salvation of their friends. To illustrate this, he dumped the entire tank of fish into the church floor and watched as panicking children attempted to save the dying fish. On his Facebook page, he bragged about the success of the sermon later.

“Well, yesterday's sermon was a big hit! We had a mass execution of feeder fish that I pulled out of a fish tank and then threw all over the floor. The kids were in shock and then started to pic[sic] them up and put them back into the fish tank. Obviously, most of them died in the effort...the point however was made that they cared more about .15 cent feeder fish then[sic] they do about their friends dying w/o Christ.”

[Added screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/0xZAX.jpg ]

I have two major problems with this: the casual disregard for the lives of the fish, and the trauma this has caused the children.

The pastor said later on the church's Facebook page  in response to another person's anxiety about the event, “The fish that you appear to be concerned for were .15 cent ""feeder fish"" that I bought at a local petfood supply company.” A far cry from gleefully suffocating them to prove a point to panicking children, these fish were intended to be eaten by other fish or water-dwelling animals. This practice is, for lack of a better term, going out of style. It's an attempt to simulate the natural feeding habits of predators in the water. It has been argued against for multiple reasons, including the idea that fish cannot be naturally hunted in an enclosed environment, nor can easily-raised “feeder fish” provide balanced nutrition for those feeding on them.

In the Biblical sense, I don't see how this entire concept could possibly be rationalized. The pastor claims that this idea was approved by the elders of the church—after all, these fish were going to die anyways and cost only 15¢ each. Apparently, they all forgot Luke 12:6, in which Jesus says “Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God.” (New International Version) The same story is told in Matthew, chapter 10. Jesus used these annoying, apparently useless “pests” of the time to illustrate a human's worth in the eyes of God. Was this pastor making the same point? No, his message did not include the message of a loving plan of salvation, nor did it comment on the worth of a human life; at least, not in that sense. This message was that these children should be making certain that their friends were converted to their belief system; to do otherwise would be to condemn their friends to death, much like this pastor condemned the fish in his ghastly illustration. To me, that makes him quite the opposite of God; you might even say “the Devil.”

As a mother, the thought that someone would even consider subjecting young minds to torturing and killing animals outrages me. There is a growing correlation between the subjection of children to animal abuse and violent acts later in life, as well as a correlation between abuse to animals and domestic abuse by the same person. If these children who watched came away without emotional repercussion, what does that say about their “moral compass?” As for the children who struggled to save the fish, ultimately in vain, what were they taught about the futility of making a difference in preserving life? How do they now perceive their relationships with adults—who in their impressionable eyes will not only cause suffering, but stand by and laugh while death takes the innocent?

I don't want this to become a religious war—this is about a seriously troubled mind, if anything. Who wakes up and decides the best way to spread the “Good Word” is to slaughter helpless animals in front of children?  On the other hand, if anyone in my religious circle even hinted at this sort of cruelty, there would be nationwide repercussions—certainly including investigations by animal rights programs and children protection agencies—punctuated by cries of “animal sacrifice!” And to use the killing of animals—any animal—for religious purpose is entirely animal sacrifice.

Cruelty against fish may seem laughable at first, but the willingness to commit mass abuse and violence in front of children is not. As Proverbs 12:10 says, “A righteous man cares for the needs of his animal, but the kindest acts of the wicked are cruel.” (New International Version)

Now obviously I am not a Christian, but most people I know are, so I tried to write this from a point of view that they would understand. Please don't take my quotes as an attempt to be petty or attack Christianity--I was trying to put this in terms he would understand.

I wrote this late last night, after seeing the screenshot of his initial statement on facebook and trying to learn everything I could on the event. Not much has changed, except the pastor has issued some non-apologies on his church's facebook page; the basic ""I'm sorry I got caught, now are you brave enough to tell me where you learned about this?"" stuff. On my own page, where I put this article originally, he did comment. Not much was notable (more attempts to justify what he did) except for the fact that he pointed out the age of the children involved--Jr and Sr high students. That still bothers me, but not as much as if they had been younger.

Love and attention? Vet?
What the little bastard needs is to get his ass kicked some more.
He's been a little bitch since he was a kitten- crying when he wants out of his cage, crying when he's hungry. The only thing that could shut him up was me throwing one of my boots at him.
He's almost 3 now. He needs to be a man and learn to do a few things on his own.
I give his fat ass food, and all I ask from him is a little respect for me, and my home. Does he give it to me? No. He constantly does things to piss me off.
I tell him not to go on the counter in the kitchen. Does he listen? Nope. I catch him almost every day when I come home up on the counter. So, I have to rough him up a bit- smack him around and show him who's boss.
Oh, and he is ABSOLUTELY NOT ALLOWED anywhere near my room or my bed.
This , is what happened to the little shithead the last time he broke that rule.
I call it the ""punishment box"".
For passing the threshold of my bedroom door, it's 1 hour bound up in the box. For sleeping on my bed, it's 3 hours. I have a zero-tolerance policy for cat hair in my bed.

Does animal rights movement have a chance of growing? I want to know if there's any statistics or study showing if support for animals is growing, both directly and proportionally, in what age demographic.

Does this sound feasible? Am I going to get pulled away instantly?

EDIT: am now trying to rally people from local anti-fur organisations but I don't know how to get my message seen with so little time other than on facebook mainly...

I'm not very good at this type of thing, but hopeful someone in the comments will figure out some genius ways of to get it off their menu forever.
   
Some very basic ideas I've had: If you are located in Vancouver put up flyers, protest out front, tell everyone you know to never eat there, mail angry letters to Vancouver, and Provincial officials, or try something more ""confrontational"" (within the confines of the law of course...cough cough).   


If you are from another city please give them horrible reviews online until they have zero stars on all the major review sites.

Please help spread the word. The County Sheriff's Office is trying to hide information and sweep this under the rug to avoid a lawsuit, because they KNOW they messed up badly.

From Saturday until this past Sunday there was: harassment, illegal entering my house without a warrant, brutality against a minor for calling an officer an ""asshole"" for shooting our dog, child endangerment (the officer almost kicked my 9.5 month old daughter over while charging at my brother in my house), animal cruelty, false accusations against my husband, my brother, and our baby Ruger, unlawful arrests, an officer who pushed my hand away from my face while I was wiping away tears, police misconduct, premeditation (murder), and conflict of interest. The County didn't put two of the officers names on the report because they both have personal agendas against us thanks to my ex-stepdad, who we're in a legal battle with regarding my deceased Mothers estate.

I don't really know where to start first with all of this. I'm not sure what type of lawyer to find. I've spoken with the Ozark Police Department (they showed up later after everything went down), and they are willing to testify that our Ruger had never been vicious towards them, and they could tell something wasn't right when they got to the crime scene of our pup. Our neighbor let us know that he hadn't heard any barking from Ruger in the 20 minutes we has been gone. More information regarding the story is on the Facebook page. If anyone has advice, please share it."	t5_2qhtg	True

scooby was shot this morning. protecting the house in which he resides. an officer of the san diego police department, decided it was necessary to enter my backyard. in total disregard to all warning signs, i.e. ""beware of dog"" sign on fence. and enter my property on a noise complaint call.scooby at that point barked and charged toward the unexpected intruder.at which point the officer deemed it necessary to discharge a 45calibur round into the top of scoobys nose. intentionally aiming for the forehead to execute the dog. who i might add was simply doing his job as a protector of the house, and was well within his property limits.scooby is doing well and is expected to recover just fine. but the real problem lies within the system. how about we start assigning real men and women, with integrity, common sense, and competence to the force that is suppose to ""protect"" our communities. and stop assigning handguns to little boy that just want to play cowboys and indians. feeling a little dissapointed with the system.... prayers for a speedy recovery for scooby are appreciated...

1365918316.0	1cbaat	How Animal Rights Activism Is Being Labled As Illness	Animal-Lib3	34	10	14	"I recently came across two Facebook group pages I found to be quite disturbing. One of the groups is called, “The DSM V Needs to Classify Animal Rights Activism as a Mental Disorder” (https://www.facebook.com/pages/Animal-Rights-Activists-with-Mental-Disorders/256572571032574?sk=app_2309869772). 

This group states that, ""Animal Rights Activists are Mentally Ill and the DSM V Needs to acknowledge it. 

The DSM V stands for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. It is published by the American Psychiatric Association and is used to ""diagnose mental disorders"".
 
The other group is called “Animal Rights Activists with Mental Disorders” (https://www.facebook.com/DSMVanimalrights) which states it was created ""to help inform people of the mental disorders that many animal rights activists may suffer from to help them.""
 
The intentions of these groups to make animal rights activists out to be violent people intent on harming others is so malicious and ludicrous, it is almost laughable. 

What these groups are really saying is that they don't agree with the beliefs of animal rights activists; therefore, animal rights activiststs are ""mentally unstable.""
 
Did I miss the logic, here? 

Not only are these groups dehumanizing to people who dedicate their lives to fighting against cruelty and suffering , but they are dehumanizing to everyone who has ever challenged the status quo, and who have ever spoken out against the undeniable viciousness humanity is capable of unleashing upon human and non-human animals. 

However, it is not surprising that the unenlightened moderators of these groups have chosen the tactics of labeling animal activism as a “mental illness,” as this has been the method employed by those who have sought to silence other kinds of social activism in the past. 

In closing, I will quote the writing of Harold A. Herzog, Jr., from a study called ""The Movement Is My Life"": The Psychology of Animal Rights Activists (http://www.psychologytoday.com/files/attachments/44240/the-movement-is-my-life.pdf,) which ironically, I located at the Animal Rights Activist with Mental Disorders group page - I guess they forgot to read this part: 

""I found the people I interviewed to be intelligent, articulate, and sincere. Though some were obsessed with their cause, none were ""crazy"" or irrational.

Millions of individuals die yearly for want of food, thus keeping down the mass. Even in our enlightened communities, and not withstanding the many charitable efforts, this is still, in all probability, the chief evil. I do not mean here absolute want of food, but want of healthful nutriment. How to provide good and plentiful food is, therefore, a most important question of the day. On the general principles the raising of cattle as a means of providing food is objectionable, because, in the sense interpreted above, it must undoubtedly tend to the addition of mass of a ""smaller velocity."" It is certainly preferable to raise vegetables, and I think, therefore, that vegetarianism is a commendable departure from the established barbarious habit. That we can subsist on plant food and perform our work even to advantage is not a theory, but a well-demonstrated fact. Many races living almost exclusively on vegetables are of superior physique and strength. There is no doubt that some plant food, such as oatmeal, is more economical than meat, and superior to it in regard to both mechanical and mental performance. Such food, moreover, taxes our digestive organs decidedly less, and, in making us more contented and sociable, produces an amount of good difficult to estimate. In view of these facts every effort should be made to stop the wanton and cruel slaughter of animals, which must be destructive to our morals. To free ourselves from animal instincts and appetites, which keep us down, we should begin at the very root from which we spring: we should effect a radical reform in the character of the food. There seems to be no philosophical necessity for food. We can conceive of organized beings living without nourishment, and deriving all the energy they need for the performance of their lifefunctions from the ambient medium. In a crystal we have the clear evidence of the existence of a formative life-principle, and though we cannot understand the life of a crystal, it is none the less a living being.""

Killing of frogs takes place in the beginning of performance (around 15 minutes in). A bowl of alive frogs is brought and each actor takes one of the frog into some cloth (shirt). Then one by one actors stomp violently on those bundles then clean the mess with cloth and take the cloth and dead frog off stage.

Just to be clear I'm not looking for a discussion about the value of this as art, meaning of it, this performance in general, tendencies of contemporary art, etc. What I am really interested is what can be done to stop the killing of frogs on stage? Because I feel strongly that the line has been crossed that should not be crossed.
I considered posting this on /r/legaladvice but this subreddit seems more on topic. I have not much experience on Reddit and am not an English speaker, so please bear with me.

Edit: Regarding location: performance was happening in Vienna, Austria. The performers are from Belgium.

1332616530.0	rbpfs	I just started a facebook group - People against the use of animals as props	dustbunnyodoom	19	1	4	"So I started this group for people to I guess call out businesses that are exploiting animals by using them as props in photographs (very common for Easter photos).  
[People against the use of animals as props](http://www.facebook.com/groups/412914295388607/) 

Why am I doing this?

 Well, I used to work at a portrait studio a few years ago when they had rabbits and one of the rabbits didn't make it, the conditions in general were awful no animal should be subjected to that (the screaming children that pull at the animal's fur or ears, incompetent photographers, pushy parents, the list goes on). It was the only season they ever used animals and it seemed like the owner never wanted to do it again. I quit the job almost two years ago and just now I see that they are using a baby goat (only a few days old) in pictures. I can only imagine what kind of hell that animal is going through right now. Rather than go directly to the business owner who most likely won't listen to me, I'm going after the mall in which their business is located and telling them that I will not buy anything from their mall until the exploitation ends. 

I spread the message on my personal facebook page, I google+'ed it, I tweeted at the mall and to PETA, and now I've made the group. I doubt many of you are from my little city, but there is probably a studio in your area pulling this crap, if you know of one please share it on the group wall, if you're in my neck of the woods (Albany NY) please consider calling Colonie Center and letting them know that you aren't down with the needless suffering of animals for pictures that will be forgotten with in a matter of weeks.

I'm sorry for the rambling but I am so angry right now, I'm just trying to spread the word against the using of animals as props. 

 **UPDATE: Update: After talking with the management at my local mall it was determined that the photo studio was in violation of their agreement, the animals will be safe soon! I hope this goes to show that we can make a difference!**

The possum used in this event is snatched from its natural home and are reportedly confined to a retail store until the event. During the ""drop,"" the frightened animal will be subjected to a screaming crowd, fireworks, and the firing of muskets, which can damage her sensitive hearing and respiratory system. It’s no wonder that eyewitnesses have reported that possums used in previous years were shaking in fear. After the event, the possum apparently will be released in a parking lot, putting it in danger of being hit by a car.

Its /r/RescuePetsUK
I have created this due to personal reasons and difficulty in rehoming 2 cats. I have seen a few subreddits, but most seem USA based. This one is for the UK only.
I have a personal hatred of healthy animals being put down due to no other reason than they cant find a home for them.
So I have decided to create this subreddit to try and find pets a new home. Every animal deserves love and care, and if I can save just one animal from being put down. Well, I consider that a great success.
So, if you know anyone that is trying to get a pet rehomed, for whatever reason. Please make a post in /r/RescuePetsUK
All posts are moderated, but will be reviewed and accepted as soon as possible.
If you work at an animal shelter, please drop me a pm so I can set you as a verified poster. I will not be doing any background checking, thats the poster's responsibility.
Many Thanks
Moderators, I know this is probably not the right subreddit. But due to the nature of this post, I would be grateful if you could leave it up."	t5_2qhtg	True

I was shocked by the number of supporters that were out cheering on the hunt, the amount of children that were along for the ride and the lack of interest the local police showed as the rural elite flouted the law.

If you are interested, HuffPoUK has a couple of great articles about the hunt:

[""It's an official secret throughout the land - away from Westminster and all the townies - that fox hunting is going strong.""](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/kate-holmes/fox-hunting-the-countrysides-best-kept-secret_b_1016400.html) 

[""They will claim, publicly, to be hunting an artificial trail. Privately they will be intent on pursuing and killing a fox...""](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/joe-duckworth/fox-hunting-season_b_1063513.html)"	t5_2qhtg	True

We've been friends for a long time and it was the first time this has come up. Well, my friend decided to kind of troll me and said this; ""If you really want to get people to reduce meat consumption why don't you open up a self-serve slaughterhouse?""

The customer purchases their animal for slaughter and can use the onsite slaughtering floors to personally slit the throat of their ""meal."" Then a butcher takes over (or the customer if he/she is so inclined) to take the cuts and wrap them up into a storage container.

Run an aggressive ad campaign challenging people to ""have the balls to eat what they kill"" or something of the like. As graphic as allowable by TV/station standards. Get in their face a bit about it ""Over here at KILLRanch we don't pretend meat grows on grocery shelves.""

Best outcome: people are forced to be introspective about meat consumption and there is a reduction in it.

Worst outcome: people continue to eat meat at similar levels but are better informed and a good amount of people might start hunting/getting their meat from more ethical sources and at least reduce the environmental footprint.

""Some companies and organizations have reached out to third parties to make videos showing the step-by-step process of how their products are actually produced. In some cases, increased transparency has helped many manufacturers gain back lost trust, and led the industry in a more positive direction.""


""Many complain that activists rarely praise the industry for these positive movements. There are very few videos that show humane treatment of animals in the industry and all too many that show mistreatment. “The industry needs the room to make mistakes, evaluate those errors, and improve upon existing systems,” writes Meredith of the Animal Agriculture Alliance. “If the goal of the activist community is to improve animal care and well-being industry-wide, they need to take a step back and decide if their current tactics are accomplishing those goals.”


Of course animal rights activists rarely praise the industry for positive"" movements. How can something as inherently unethical as animal agriculture be rationally considered as anything less.


Meredith seems to confuse animal rights with animal welfare. The goal of animal rights activists is not to kiss the asses of animal murderers, or to promote the seemingly humane improvements in the methods of slaughtering animals, but to free these sentient beings from the industry completely.


A few words for Meredith: 


The industry is a mistake, and an error in itself. The only way to improve upon existing systems is to eradicate them entirely.

Marineland in Niagara Falls, Ontario has come under fire in the past year after numerous former employees have stepped forward with allegations of animal cruelty. The [Toronto Star](http://www.thestar.com/topic.ng-m-a-r-marineland.html) has continued its reports on the ongoing investigation. 

Protests have been held at the park for years; however, following the reports of cruelty, attendance at the demonstrations has steadily increased. Protesters dramatically stormed the gates at the final show of the season in 2012. Ric O'Barry - Flipper's trainer, environmentalist, and star of The Cove - has attended demonstrations in the past, including the 2012 closing day. 

Please learn about the problems with this park (see the links below) and spread the word. Speak out against Marineland. Join us in Niagara Falls on May 18, 2013.

I suspect that there was a pretty well-funded opposition (animal agribusiness) that confused voters by twisting the facts. But if such a seemingly good measure can't pass, do animals in the U.S. have any hope against the deep pockets of animal agribusiness?

Regardless of your stance, in none of these bills are there any provisions for all of the dogs that will no longer be needed. Many of the adoption groups are already overfilled with dogs that they are trying to place with loving families, and Florida alone has over 10,000 dogs currently involved with racing. Many of these amazing animals will have no place to go and with these current bills will have no help and many will be put down or shipped to a different country to race under very deplorable conditions. This petition isn't to try and stop the closing of the tracks, but to hopefully convince lawmakers to at least keep the welfare of these dogs in mind in shutting down the sport.

I posted this comment in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/kbfwd/so_im_in_an_area_that_flooded_the_local_petco/) but I wanted to make sure people saw this.

We started to get an idea of how bad the flooding could potentially become late Wednesday morning. I work at a hospital in Johnson City that is a couple of miles away from the Petco and our Emergency Operations Center was activated to deal with the flood at around 2pm, and when I left work at 3pm it was very clear that this was going to be a severe flood.

The employees of the Petco asked their manager to allow them to take the animals home but they were told no, since the manager didn't believe the flooding would get as bad as it did. They moved the animals up as high as they could and closed the store at around 5pm. One of the employees went back a bit before midnight and there was no flooding at that time and no flood warnings or evacuation orders for their area issued (I don't know if the area that the store is in was under an evacuation order or not at that time) and when they came back the next morning the plaza where the Petco is located was flooded. I took [this picture](http://www.flickr.com/photos/wchamilton/6129946762/in/photostream/lightbox/) of ""Party City"" at about 6:40 Friday morning, which is immediately to the left of Petco, and you can see the water got to be about 4-5 feet high.

The Fire Department wouldn't allow them into the store because power was still on at the building and the Fire Department wasn't able to divert resources to the store to disconnect the power, due to their efforts being centered on rescuing residents. The employees had their own boats waiting and when the Fire Department killed the power to the store on Friday morning the employees proceeded to go get the animals. They rescued 100, but about 100 didn't make it. I don't know what time Friday morning this happened... it's possible that when I was at the plaza the evacuation had already occurred but I can't be certain of that. 

If anyone is to be blamed, it's the management of the store... they had resources available to evacuate the animals and they chose not to utilize them, as they claim they had no reason to believe the flooding would be as bad as it became. The actual ""rank and file"" employees of the store are devastated at what happened, and the one who spoke to the rescue group was in tears when they relayed the story.

Everyone has made bad judgement calls throughout their lives... I have, you have, and the management of the Johnson City Petco has, and that's something they'll always live with. I don't know why management didn't know or refused to believe the flooding would get as bad as it did, but I don't think the decisions made were done out of malice or cruelty. The fact that that judgement cost the lives of innocent animals is absolutely tragic, but after hearing from this person I don't think it was done out of cruelty or malice, but just poor decision making, and that's something the management will have to live with.
