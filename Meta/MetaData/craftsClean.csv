Made with your basic mini 8G USB key (Staples brand). Cover in a thin layer of polymer clay (Fimo), ensuring that the two halves of the USB come apart easily, then bake at 230C for 10min (yes, with USB in). String together with other beads, etc, to make a bracelet/necklace/whatever. Provided your USB fits snugly in its cap, it doubles as a clasp.

As the holiday season is upon us, I thought that creating a thread with redditors' etsy sites would be beneficial.  If your post your shop in this thread, I hope to repost this thread in other subreddits for exposure.  I'll also add it to our sidebar.

Rather than just the website, please add a description, target audience, etc. (see below for an example) for the benefit of buyers.  Feel free to add any fields that you need!

*an example:*  
**Shop Name:**  [NAME]  
**Site:**  [Etsy, Artfire, etc.]  
**Short Description:**  I sell awesome wares made from the wool from my sheep.  
**Types of items you sell:**  Scarves, hats, gloves  
**Price range:** $10-$25  
**Ships from:** USA  
**International shipping?**: Yes

Plus it puts me in a really awkward position to say no!

The worst is the ""I'll pay you"" line.  Bitch, you can't afford me!  Minimum wage where I'm from is $10 an hour... multiply that by the five hours it took me to make this scarf, plus the $10 I spent on yarn, and suddenly they're much less willing to pay.
