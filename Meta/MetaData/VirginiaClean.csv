1368707093.0	1eg369	Fredericksburg - Military widow's phone stolen with only photos of husband. Please read!	RaptorGoRawr	60	11	6	"$10,000 reward for stolen cell phone.
Begging whoever has it. (Fredericksburg)Someone took my phone. A Samsung Galaxy S3. It's white. It's only worth a few hundred bucks to you or anyone else. If you unlock the screen you will see my home screen.
In the picture stands a man. A man with a backpack and 2 other bags. That man you see, was my husband. And that night, it was the last time he ever held me. If you open the gallery you will see a collection of photos. Mostly of him. But some of his children as well. You will also see some of his funeral. Of his burial flag, his coffin.
See, that man you saw on the home screen. The one who looks so eager to head into a war zone to protect the country he loved and his family, he lost his life doing so. The only pictures I have of him are on that phone because my computer crashed after I transferred them.
Tonight, I cried uncontrollably in the arms of a friend because tonight I felt as though I lost my husband once more. I know with time my memory will fade. I will have difficulty explaining his features to his children. Or why I think they look like him. One who never had the honor of meeting his father.
I don't care about the phone. If you have it. Please just email me. I will respond and you will be able to send them to my email and you will never hear from me again. I only want the pictures nothing else. The reward money is 100%. If you can prove to me you have the phone and are willing to give it back. Proof required: My husbands Eye color hair color and shirt color in the skype photo of him. Along with the type of cover that was on the phone.

&gt;It is with great pleasure that we announce we have scheduled an AMA (Ask Me Anything) with Rob Sarvis on Reddit, August 10th, 8 PM through 10 PM EST. Be there to ask him questions and learn more about him.

For those who don't know, Robert Sarvis is currently polling at 7% in the race against Terry McAuliffe (D) and Ken Cuccinelli (R) in the Commonwealth of Virginia's race for Governor this year. Because of the significant dissatisfaction among regular voters with the two major candidates, there's a real chance for Sarvis to make a run at perhaps 10 or 15%, which could really help break the two-party grip on politics in coming years. He's running mostly on a platform of freedom, school choice, marriage equality, ending drug prohibition, and lower taxes.

It'd be great if we could get some exposure for him and ask some interesting questions."	t5_2qj17	True

[Delegate Harvey Morgan](http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?111+mbr+H67) has recently introduced [THIS BILL](http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?111+sum+HB1443) to the VA state legislature. It DECRIMINALIZES possession of our good friend, Mari Tokens, thus making the violation of law no longer subject to being placed on one's permanent criminal record and eliminates the threat of jail for 30 days.

Here's where YOU come in. You need to e-mail your Delegate and Senator and plead with him/her to support this legislation. BUT WAIT! I'm gonna make it easy for you! Just click [HERE](http://capwiz.com/virginia21/directory/statedir.tt?state=VA&amp;lvl=state), put your zip code in, and it will tell you who your Senator and Delegate is and provide you with links to their contact info.

These people don't get that much contact from their constituents, compared to the national level legislatures. So even a few emails from their constituents can be a big deal!

So go at it people! Let me know if you have any questions~"	t5_2qj17	True

BB worker here wanted plead for your donations specifically if you are Oneg or AB positive.  The level 1 trauma center I am at normally keeps 8 units of Oneg in the ER for when a person bleeding profusely comes in and needs blood immediately, however currently because of a shortage they currently have two.  Meaning if you and your buddy are in an accident the ER picks one, then the other has to wait longer because it takes longer to get more blood from the lab and hopefully this doesn't hurt the chance of survival in a multi person trauma/emergency.  We have been short for 4 days now, the supply in the lab is very low and we are starting to look out of virginia for more supply.  So please get out and donate, if you're Oneg then be sure to do a double donation (they take 2 units of red cells and put all your plasma back in you).


We have plenty of A blood in stock, but platelets are very welcomed.  (platelets can go to any blood type with a few conditions, but pretty much accurate)

She was at a going away party 2 days ago with the entire family in PA at the time. It is too convenient it went missing when no one was home, in-between the hours of 2PM and 7PM. She had the car parked out in front of my cousin's Cul-De-Sac house and we are convinced that one of my cousin's drug dealing friends stole it. One of my cousin's got a call during the party to ask if they, my aunt, or my uncle were around.(possibly a telemarketer but I am suspicious) My cousin told them no. So the opportunity to snag it was there. Also the car has laser locks, meaning it is hard as hell to hotwire. On top of that no glass was left at the scene, meaning forced entry is not likely. My sister says she lost a key at my cousin's house, between the dates of May 18-May 20. Meaning it is likely that it was actually stolen from by one of the drugies without her knowledge. The car had GPS but not lowjack, the Audi dealership said they can't track it through the GPS which majorly sucks.

She sunk a lot of money into this new car, and is moving to Cali with her Marine boyfriend tomorrow...so kind of urgent. And the cops aren't following any leads or doing anything short of putting it in a nationwide database.

The [Car](http://i.imgur.com/78aWc2K.jpg) has Pennsylvania plates. License Plate number jdy-0084. Last seen on 306 Ainstree Court, Vienna, Va 22180. The car is also automatic.

Please contact me and/or the police if you have any information. Thank you. We need to stop it before it ends up in a chop shop.


My suspicion is if this was someone that stole my sister's keys a month ago than they have already got a buyer and the car is probably gone. But I am hopeful. I don't know if they would go and try and sell it on Craig's List. But I figured that would be a good place to sell off parts if they don't have a chop shop, or think they can make more money on their own. I was told that tires and wheels are the first thing they would probably sell off the Audi online. My sister doesn't know for sure what kind of tires she had but I think they were goodyear size 225/50R17.
The party was 2 days ago.

I just got a good job and would like to begin taking her on weekend trips to show her more of this state's fabulously rich history and natural beauty. There are lots of websites and guides, but I want to know what sites you Redditors found to be high quality experiences.

I wasn't sure where to start so I ended up calling legal aid. I make too much money to qualify but the kind lady that I spoke to had me call the Virginia Lawyer Referral Service. For $35 you are entitled to one half hour with a lawyer in good standing with the Virginia State Bar to whom they refer you. I gave my credit card for the $35, told her what I needed help with so she could choose the right kind of lawyer, and after the requested ten minutes for the database to update was able to have my consultation this afternoon (the referrer said it could be 3-4 days fyi). At the end of our conversation we had the option him being retained as my lawyer but there was no obligation on either of our parts. It turned out that I have no recourse which is what I suspected, but it cost considerably less (35 vs $200) to find that out. Just wanted to let you guys know that this service is out there if you need it as many firms seem to only offer free consultation for certain disputes (mine with real estate isn't among them usually).

Since 1960, the volunteers of the West End Volunteer Rescue Squad have been there whenever the community needs us, anywhere in Richmond. We provide emergency medical services, disaster response, and educate the community in how to save lives. We provide invaluable on-the-job training for countless people who want to pursue careers in medicine, public safety, and a variety of other fields.

Unfortunately, our 52 year legacy of service is close to an end. As a volunteer organization, we rely on the generous financial support of the community to keep the lights on and the ambulances running. Our donation revenue is down 82% since 2008; our reserves have been depleted, and without your help, our doors may close forever.

1371137611.0	1g9tvn	I'm moving to Virginia very soon and have no idea what to expect. Can you answer my questions?	drowninginflames	24	3	72	"So I've accepted a staff position with part of Virginia Tech. This is a dream job for me and my family, and I'm extremely excited for it. I'm currently living in Southern California, where I've lived my whole life. Obviously I'm going to be moving out there, and that's got to start happening very, very soon.

I've been spending a lot of time online trying to do research to figure out exactly what life is going to be like out there. I'll be living in the Blacksburg/Christiansburg/Radford area. Now, obviously since I've never lived in this area, I don't really know what to expect, where to live, and what some things mean, so I've got some questions!

First off, heating for your home. What's a heat pump? Is it better than a furnace? I'm concerned about being warm enough, I've got a 4 year old daughter and my fiance is due with out second child in December, so I want to make sure the house/apartment is warm enough.

For those of you that know this area, what advice can you give? I do know that Blacksburg tends to be a bit more expensive because of VT. 

Elementary schools? My daughter will be starting school next year, so that's a pretty big concern for me. From what I've read, the Blacksburg schools are a bit better than the others, but they are all rated higher than the schools where I'm currently living. What problems do these schools have? What kinds of questions should I be asking?

Is a long commute (30 minutes to an hour) common in this area? I'm used to driving 1 to 2 hours each way for work, so its not unusual for me. But I do worry about snow. Do they clear the roads quickly, or should I try to make sure my commute is as short as possible? Also, how are the roads out there? I've been to a lot of other states, mainly in the Mid West, and most states had really rough roads due to weather. Is this also common here? I'm worried about my tiny car handling crappy driving conditions.

Whats the crime like in this area? I'm used to pretty high crime. Here, you lock your doors and windows all the time, if you don't lock your car it'll be empty or gone next time you go to it, you really have to watch out for yourself.

Outdoor life. I've got the beach 7 miles from my apartment, so it's going to be a big change not having it so close. But I am looking forward to the change of scenery, and having the mountains close. Is there fishing, camping, hiking and etc close to that area?

Any other tips and advice would be great. This is going to be a vastly different lifestyle, and I'm excited for it. But I don't want to walk into something stupid because of my ignorance!

TL;DR: Give me advice about the Blacksburg area!

Her daughter is completely schizophrenic and dangerous to her, long story short, has essentially ruined every aspect of her life. She's an elderly woman, her husband recently died, followed by her losing her job, basically due to her life being a ruin. The daughter has more or less bankrupted them through legal trouble, car accidents, etc., too much to go into. So her electricity is about to be cut off, she has no other family who will speak with her due to the presence of the daughter's destructive nature. My mother in law is on the verge of taking these people in, because her and the mother have been lifelong friends, and I am not very excited about the idea of my very kind mother in law being subjected to the inevitable chaos sheltering this woman's daughter will cause. We live in California, so I'm somewhat at a loss as to how I can help. I don't even know if I could call mental health, social workers, or what, I have no experience in this field. Although you have probably figured this out on your own, my Mother in law and the others involved live in Virginia (Richmond to be specific).

**TL;DR:** How do I help a sweet, broke old lady with a dangerous insane daughter to keep said insane daughter from moving into my Mother in Laws house, from across the country?  

If anyone can even give me a starting point as to what kind of services might be available to call, I'd be very grateful. Battered women, elderly care, mental health, someone light me a candle.  "	t5_2qj17	True

I need help. I have been gathering signatures almost entirely on my own. Time is getting short, and I need help getting enough signatures to get on the ballot.
If you are eligible to register to vote in VA's 11th district you can circulate a petition sheet on my behalf.

I am running on a platform of:

One law for all: The powerful elite and ultra-rich live by a separate set of rules - things you and I would go to jail for they get off without any repercussions.

End ALL the wars: Iraq, Afghanistan, the War on Drugs, the War on Terror, etc. They are not accomplishing our goals, they enrich and act as recruiting tools for our 'enemies'. They are used as bludgeon to scare the US population into sacrificing our liberties for the illusion of safety.

Civil RIGHTS, not privileges: The US government operates under the illusion that our Constitutionally guaranteed rights are in fact privleges that we only get if they decide we should. Laws like the PATRIOT act, CISPA, NDAA 2012, etc seek to erode our rights in the interest of the security of the corporate/government complex.

Sustainable energy: We will run out of oil as an energy source the moment our energy return on energy invested reaches 1:1. This will happen far sooner than we expect. We need to get ahead of the curve and develop sustainable energy while we have the excess capacity in the system to invest in the development of it.

Stop the looting, Start prosecuting: Wall Street banks and other corporations flagrantly violate the black letter of the law, knowing that because of regulatory capture at most they will pay a fine that is a fraction of their profits. Fines are just a cost of doing business: PROSECUTE!

Those are just a couple points of my platform. I'm an independent progressively minded individual who believes in basing public policy on data and evidence of effectiveness, not rhetoric and ideology. If you disagree with my ideas and opinions, and can show me the data to support your position, I am willing to change my mind. We need more average Americans challenging the powers that be in their own arena: running for public office. My interests lie at the macro level - thus I am running for office at the Federal level with no prior political experience. I am untainted and unencumbered by obligations to special interests or corporate interests.

I want to be a Congressman for the opportunity to represent American citizens and their best interest, to protect our rights and freedoms, and to help our society transition to a more sustainable model.

I will do an AMA later, right now I have to go out to collect signatures.

Any advice as to how i can make the move (to Bristol, VA) and find work before the end of the year?	doctorvink	25	5	26	It's like the title says. I currently live in Knoxville while my son and his mother live in VA near Bristol. She left Knox earlier this year when she was offered a great job over there and the plan has always been for me to follow so I could be close. He turned 1 in August and that was the last time I've seen him. My relationship with his mother is good. We talk every day and she sends me photos and videos. We also Skype and read him bed time stories together. She is just a full time student and works full time and i haven't had the money for a car so it makes the travel difficult. I work full time, but it's been nothing but a struggle trying to figure out a feasible plan. Anyways, I'm looking for anyone who knows Bristol or the surrounding area and can give me advice or suggestions that can help me get situated and established in the town before the end of the year. I am NOT looking for hand outs and such. I've always made my own way, but every now and then you have to ask for guidance, you know? I appreciate any help what so ever. Thank you.	t5_2qj17	True

Official press release below.

Pro-Choice Activists Call Cuccinelli’s Bluff: Save Abortion Clinics or Lose Hospitals

An activist working with Oppose TRAP has submitted a petition calling into question the legality of the current regulations of most Virginia hospitals. Taking Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli at his word, the petition points out the unintended consequences of his position on grandfathering for women’s health centers that provide abortion care, which under 2011 legislation are now defined as hospitals.

In 2011 the Virginia General Assembly passed SB924, defining health care facilities that perform first-trimester abortions as hospitals, requiring they be regulated by the Board of Health. Despite a panel of medical experts’ recommendation to grandfather in existing facilities2, the regulations as written by Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli’s office required clinics to undergo extremely costly structural upgrades to parking spaces, hallways widths, awnings, etc. These medically unnecessary requirements come from three chapters of a manual called the 2010 Guidelines for Design and Construction of Health Care Facilities, and are unrelated to women’s health and safety.

These regulations were expected to permanently close the doors of at least 75% of the abortion clinics in the state.1 After public protest and outspoken opposition from the medical community made clear the dire consequences of Ken Cuccinelli’s position, the Board passed an amendment that would exempt existing clinics from having to meet the new building codes.

In response, Cuccinelli opined that the Board of Health did not have the authority to grandfather existing clinics. He threatened to withhold future legal counsel from the Board, directing it to pass the regulations as originally written.

The Board of Health capitulated, effectively sentencing the closure of most abortion clinics in the state.

The facility guidelines for hospital construction clearly state they are “intended as minimum standards for designing and constructing new health care facility projects.” When it was pointed out that these are not new facilities, and in some cases have been in safe operation for decades, the Attorney General's Office declared that they were new hospitals because the 2011 legislation newly defined them as hospitals.

Since that time, reproductive rights activist Molly Taylor Vick researched the legislation which originally defined general hospitals in 1947, just as SB924 defined abortion clinics as hospitals in 2011. After further investigation she discovered the first Rules and Regulations Governing Licensure of General Hospitals in an unprocessed box of files at an off-site archive of the Library of Virginia; these regulations did grandfather in existing hospitals without requiring them to meet the same standards as newly constructed facilities.

Now, with clinics already closing3 and only a year remaining until some must come into compliance, Molly Taylor Vick has filed a petition that challenges Ken Cuccinelli to defend the legality of his position. This may provoke concern in some reproductive rights advocates, who could feel uncomfortable being associated with a legal process that has the potential to shut down health care facilities. They cannot afford to alienate their allies in the medical community.

Oppose TRAP appreciates these concerns. “Access to health care is something we all value very highly, but this is really about whether people believe in equal application of the law. One argument of pro-choice activists has been that abortion clinics cannot be regulated differently than other facilities; that the law must be applied equally. That is exactly what we’re saying. We are merely pointing out the implications of a decision made by Cuccinelli.” Oppose TRAP continues to explain that after due diligence, they also feel confident that the economic, political and social consequences are so severe that there is not a real threat to general hospitals. “That is the whole point. It is absurd. Cuccinelli needs to explain how it isn’t or own up to what he has done.”

Molly Taylor Vick notes that participation in the public comment period does not equal support for the petition. “People are encouraged to use their voices to express their individual concerns, whether they are in support of or strong opposition to the petitions.”

She further contends that this is taking the fight to where Ken Cuccinelli pretends it is - in the legal interpretation and application of law. “He must own this.”

Cuccinelli can not selectively apply the law:

If existing hospitals CANNOT be grandfathered in under new regulations, this brings into question the legal status of every facility built prior to 2005, many of which will now be forced to undergo the same costly architectural renovations as abortion clinics. This could result in hospitals across the state closing their doors.

If existing hospitals CAN be legally grandfathered as they always have been, then they CAN be legally grandfathered today, and Cuccinelli overstepped his legal and professional authority by refusing to certify those approved regulations. He also overstepped ethical boundaries by threatening to withhold representation if the Board of Health was sued.

VDH must either act to amend hospital regulations to require current construction code of existing facilities or readdress the issue of grandfathering as applied to abortion clinic facilities.

Fresh water is a high priority, and the possibility of electricity would be nice but not necessary at all. The theoretical cabin will have running water, but no electricity needed, coal heat, and outhouses. Tell me if you can make my dream come true! 	t5_2qj17	True

NFunspoiler	24	5	4	"For those of you who don't know, CISPA is the bill that would introduce Chinese style censorship into the USA under the guise of national security!  Right now it is has been attached to another bill S.2105.  The president said he will veto CISPA but this time he actually supports S.2105!  This bill will be voted on soon in early June, so we have to act now!

I called them and here are the results:

*Senator Mark Warner (D-VA)*: wasn't in office, but staff member said she would pass along the message.  **Phone: 202-224-2023**

*Senator Jim Webb (D-VA)*: same thing. Staff member said he'd pass along the message.  **Phone: 202-224-4024**

Obviously I told them to vote against S2105 and that I oppose any internet censorship. The staffers who I talked to didn't know either senator's position on CISPA or S2105 so I suspect that they haven't been getting many calls over the issue. So make sure you call ASAP and let your voice be heard!

A college friend who still lives in my state, an avid pit bull enthusiast, has offered to take Titus.  He has a big, lovely home with plenty of space for Titus to run and swim, plenty of resources and ~10 years of experience in training/owning/fostering pits, and for an added bonus: because he's someone I know, I'll be able to see how Titus is doing in his new home.  Thanks for all your input, both positive and negative.  A special thank-you to those of you who mentioned different shelters in my relative area that I could look into.  Oddly enough, once I got everything in place for my friend to take him, Titus got two phone calls back from two of the no-kill shelters that I'd contacted.  So, even if my friend would've have been able to take him, he would've had a second chance elsewhere.**

[Titus](http://imgur.com/a/r3KhM) joined our family almost 3 years ago as a puppy. We rescued him from a local kill shelter. His mom was believed to have been a breeder for a small-time puppy mill and Titus was one of three puppies that needed a home.

During the last 3 years, our family has grown. My husband and I have two small sons, ages 6 months and 2 years. In this time, we've also lost a dog (Titus's ""mentor""), and have added a new dog to our family. Titus loves his companion.
My family has been facing many hardships, a lot of which stem from financial woes. As we've been bumping along, trying to hold on to our raft, life's lobbed some curve balls our way. One of which occurred two weeks ago, on November 13th.

On that Saturday morning, Titus was laying in his favorite sunny spot in front of our sliding glass door that overlooks the backyard. My son, also a lover of the coveted sunny spot, was driving his cars nearby. He decided to climb over Titus to get to some more cars that were in the doorway. Titus growled and bit my son's face, irritated with him. I quickly scooped up my son and put the dogs in my bedroom. My son's face was bleeding, he clearly needed stitches or butterfly sutures in the least. I rushed him to the E.R. where he did, indeed, need stitches.

When I got back home from the hospital, I called our local animal shelter/dog warden to discuss surrendering Titus. My husband and I had discussed what we would do if one of our dogs ever bit one of the boys, long before this incident, and rehoming him through a shelter was our decision.
I was warned that due to his breed, size, age, and bite history the chances of him getting adopted were slim. Our local shelter (we live in a tiny town) has had hundreds of animals come through this year, more than any other year, and their resources are running out. This morning, the shelter called me, as Titus 10 day quarantine (customary after a dog has bitten, to check for possible rabies infection) was up. He was scheduled to be put down at 1:30 this afternoon. They asked if we wanted to reconsider as they would not be putting him up for adoption.

Even though he hurt my son, and my son will have scars, I couldn't see Titus getting euthanized as an acceptable option. He's been an amazing dog, and I know that kids and dogs don't always mesh well when a dog's personal space is being invaded. I do not condone him biting our son, but I know that he does not deserve to die. I picked Titus up and brought him home, keeping him fenced into the kitchen to let him reaclimate to life ""on the outside.""

I cannot keep him here, however. I don't want to put him, or my son, in that situation again. The bite could very well have been a one-off incident, but it's not worth it to me to test that out.
I've emailed every ""Bully-Friendly"" no-kill shelter in Virginia and none of them have space for another dog. This was done the day after I surrendered him. I thought that one of them would be able to help, but they could not (all I got were automated replies to my emails saying they're full). The shelter has given me the name of a woman who might be able to help rehome him and I will be in touch with her tomorrow (Tuesday).
I'm hoping that Reddit can help. If there's someone you know that can help in any way, please let me know. 

Here are the details:
1. We're located in northern Virginia
2. Titus is a neutered, red-nose pit bull (pretty sure he's purebred)
3. He loves to play outside, but cannot sleep outside (he loves to get under the covers with you at bedtime)
4. He's about 60lbs, so he needs plenty of room/exercise
5. No cats (he's treed one or two, and hasn't attacked one, but better safe than sorry on that one)
6. No kids (teens might be a better fit, though)
7. He needs socialization: we lived in the sticks for most of his life, prior to moving into the country we lived in an apartment complex that had quite a few dog-aggressive dogs that scared Titus, so outside of his current companion, I would say that he's most comfortable being the only dog)
8. No dogs
9. More pictures, and medical records are available, if needed

It is an old gold bracelet with alternating gold links and smokey topaz. [Unfortunately all I have is this low quality image](http://i.imgur.com/eV3ID.jpg). It is European (she is Dutch). She would certainly give a reward if someone found it or had info leading to it being found.

She is completely devastated right now so I am trying what little I can. I checked eBay and CraigsList but it isn't for sale. I am going to put up ""lost"" posts on Craigslist and call pawn shops. Not sure if there is anything else we can try. She already called everywhere she stopped, and drove back to the places.

Bob Marshall said Monday that he plans to file legislation to bar openly gay people from joining the Virginia National Guard](http://hamptonroads.com/2010/12/lawmaker-aims-ban-gays-va-guard), in response to the recent action by Congress to repeal the ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy that prevents openly gay men and women from serving in the US military:

&gt; ""...is not a moral statement about certain impulses and orientations. This is a statement as to what you need for the military."" Marshall said the purpose of the National Guard is to defend the state and the nation, and ""the behavior engaged in by persons who engage in same sex relations... is not compatible with the military.""

Governor Bob McDonnell [responded](http://hamptonroads.com/2010/12/va-governor-does-not-support-gay-ban-guard?cid=ltst) later in the day on a talk-radio program, saying that while disagrees with the action taken by Congress to allow homosexual servicemembers, he believes Virginia's state National Guard should adhere to federal guidelines.

1357686394.0	167mwz	Looking to rehome a cat.	puppyciao	19	7	5	"Hi everyone,

I have three great cats, but owning that many has put a lot of stress on me and is, I feel, unfair to the cats. I travel a lot and two of the cats are fine in the car but the third absolutely hates it.

She's an orange tabby, about 8 years old, named Sookie. I got her at 6 months of age and she had one health scare where I nursed her back to health and shouldn't happen ever again. (Long story short: if a cat experiences undue stress they can become anorexic and then their liver shuts down. Force feeding fixes that and it almost never happens again.)

She loves people and really would just prefer to hang out with a person all day, either on their lap or next to them on the couch. She trusts new people very easily. She's unfazed by dogs but generally not a fan of other cats. This is why I would prefer to rehome her as opposed to my other two cats, who are best friends. She has no behavioral issues, always goes in the litter box, doesn't mind having her nails clipped and doesn't scratch on anything excessively (the few times she does it, I use a water bottle to spray at her and this seems to be nipping that problem in the bud). As I type this she's curled up on back of the couch just above my head and purring.

I would charge a fee of $50 to weed out the crazies, which I would then donate to the Richmond SPCA. 

I'm open to her being rehomed in all areas of Virginia, DC, and even Maryland. I can send more information and pictures to anyone interested.

Besides that, does anyone have advice on rehoming pets? I'm not getting rid of her until I find the absolute perfect home."	t5_2qj17	True

My entire family is devastated.  We aren't so upset about the property, but the principle of this happening to a handicapped car collector is just terrible.  PLEASE HELP.

I currently pay $875 a month for a 2BR and $350 heat and electric. I live in Bloomfield, NJ, and know full well i could move back to Newark and save a little bit more, but i hope to never go back to that shit hole.

I'd like to know what are the best places that are safe and affordable? I just find it completely unreasonable to live out here right now(NJ), and want a change.

I like the atmosphere of my current community, its about 50,000 people or so, as opposed to the dense Newark(400,000). I think the smallness of the city adds to the community and safety feeling.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

&gt;On Saturday June 15th, 2013, my son, a Marine Gunnery Sergeant, was driving Northbound on Rt 29, approximately 4 miles outside of Gainesville, Virginia. This happened in Fauquier County. He was driving a 1998 Corvette Convertible (silver) he had literally just purchased. He was alone in the car, his wife and children being in a 2013 black Honda Pilot and driving ahead of him. 
The speed limit had just changed from 55 to 45 and both my son and his wife were in the left hand lane. A black Jeep Wrangler with the top off attempted to pass his wife on the right, but was unable to because of a red van in the right hand lane. The Jeep had two occupants, late teens/early 20's. 
When they were unable to pass , they swerved in front of my son, cutting him off, causing him to run off the road onto the shoulder and lose control of the car. Once the Jeep was able to pass my son's wife, they sped off. 
Several people stopped to offer assistance, but the deputy did not take a statement from any of them. Now the insurance company is refusing to accept my daughter-in-law's statement, claiming bias. 
We need to find some of those people who stopped, or who may have seen what happened. Please help by sharing this on your Facebook page- you never know who may have been traveling in that area that day!
If you saw something that may be helpful, or have an idea about how we could locate these people, please contact

I have a ~ 4 Month old German Shephered (http://i.imgur.com/v0da45b.jpg) - Me and the puppy (me grinning like a happy idiot).

Why I need someone to take care of her: Our apartment complex when I talked to them said they took dogs, didn't specify (my fault for not asking) age. Apparently they won't take dogs that are under a year old. Our puppy is about 4-5 months old. Not fully house trained yet (were willing to keep her until that is a solid, 2-3 weeks). We LOVE this dog. This is my first dog, and I really don't want to give her up. So we are trying this long shot to see if anyone can help.

We need someone to look after her for aprox 2-3 months. Just until she is big enough to look the part. We will pay you 100 a month (negotiable) and whatever vet fee's she needs while with you. She is an amazing puppy, Quite, she is almost crate trained. Put a blanket over her cage and shes usually good to go with very little whining.

1338323503.0	uavqj	Where can my LARP live?	workingboy	13	3	24	"Howdy /r/Virginia - I thought somebody here might have some smart ideas or some leads. 

I run a monthly boffer LARP based on Norse mythology (legendsofasgard.org) for my friends. We had been playing at a player's farm in Virgilina for about two years, but that property was recently sold. We seem now to be homeless. 

I'm trying to find another location that would be appropriate for us to play. It's a strange thing to consider. 

- We're very happy to camp out, and enjoy ""roughing it."" But we're also playing a game, so most campgrounds are not appropriate. 

- We're relatively small, ~15-20 people. It's hard for us to afford state park campgrounds, since they tend to run about $500 for a weekend. Also, there's a lot of competition between LARPs for the nicer campgrounds, such as Prince William Forest Park. 

- We're a little too big to rent a cabin and split it, comfortably. Also, some counties have tax statues that would charge an disproportional amount per person. 

- Immersion is a big part of our game. Plus, we're loud, sweaty nerds. Therefore, we need a location that is fairly private to contain the game. 

- That said, we're particularly conscientious and responsible. We always leave properties in better shape than we found them. 

- We'd be regular business for wherever we found, since we play about 10 times a year.

McDonnell limiting hourly state employees to 29 hours/week, effective immediately	raskolnik	12	5	13	"I just found out about this through an acquaintance from my old agency (I've been a state employee for about 2 years), and the [media](http://www.wvec.com/news/State-agencies-advised-to-limit-worker-hours-188731021.html) has it as well.

Since the Affordable Care Act requires that employers with more than 50 employees give insurance to those who work 30 or more hours per week, the Governor's proposed budget limits any wage employee with the state (i.e. paid hourly) to 29 hours per week.  Even though the budget hasn't passed, the Department of Human Resource Management has advised all state agencies to limit their wage folks to 29 hours per week effective immediately.  This applies even to those employees that were working 40 hours per week routinely.

From what I'm hearing this was pretty much sprung on the agencies this morning, and that no one had any advance notice.  

As a state employee and a taxpayer, I think this is a really crappy thing to do to these people, and it was mishandled on top of that.  Even if you disagree with the ACA, I think we can all agree that not giving anyone any warning was a poor decision.  On top of that, limiting the hours these employees can work is going to negatively affect state services everywhere.

Captain's Log: At 9:46pm, Father and I attempted to see the outside world. Packed with a flash light, hope, and our oil skins, we ventured down Holston Lane to see what was left of Beach Rd. The tides force nearly knocked us to the ground as it came flowing across the lane. The winds are strong and the night is dark. The Rowe household is officially an island. Mother Nature ain't no stranger to us folk. We'll stick together as we wait for tomorrow's high tide. Stay safe, America. Stay dry. Signing off.

MONDAY, OCTOBER 29th - 

Captain's Log: I suited up again this morning to venture out for medical supplies and food at 9:27am. Father stayed home to protect the fort. I later learned that he safely moved a box turtle to higher ground, claiming the lil guy was in fear for his life. The lane is covered with water up to my knees which caused my exploration to quickly become a water aerobics class. With the fear of this morning's high tide, we thought moving into the attic was our only choice, but it looks as if we've hit the worst of the storm. The wind has calmed down some; 35mph gusts only coming through ever so often. Although we have NOT lost power, I plan of turning off all electricity to feel more one with Hurricane Sandy. I'm drying off for a bit before I head back out to rescue Mother's pumpkins before they float away. Stay safe, America. Stay dry. Signing off.

MONDAY, OCTOBER 29th - 

Captain's Log: 5:40pm. The arm floaties I forced Ma and Pa to wear are no longer needed. The tide has gone down dramatically, and our grassy terrain is now visible again. With age getting the best of Father, he has turned to the couch, leaving the responsibility of taking care of looters to me. This ain't my first rodeo (and I've watched a lot of The Walking Dead), so I AM prepared. Sustained winds have picked up close to 40mph. That there news caster, Jeff Lawson, mentioned we could see gust of 55mph later this evening. Small twigs and pine needles are already overtaking our yard. Any more of this and I'll have to sedate Mother. Cabin Fever has hit her hard, and she won't stop pacing. Stay safe, EAST COAST. Stay dry. Signing off.

MONDAY, OCTOBER 29th - 

Captain's Log: Delirium has set in. Mother and Father have requested that I blow out the candles and turn the lights back on. They told me I am ""living in my own world"" and that I am being ""overly dramatic about Hurricane Sandy."" They have both relocated upstairs and won't talk to me until I take my waders off and put my BB gun away. Hopefully tomorrow's daylight will shed light on our situation. I've already spotted a picnic table and a kids play shovel that we'll have to clean up. It's sad to see my parents in such denial. I want to keep them safe, but they need to know the truth. Signing off..

TUESDAY, OCTOBER 30th - 

**FINAL** Captain's Log: I know many of you have been using my logs for informative coverage of the Fox Hill/Beach Road area, but it seems as if there isn't much left to report. Father and I have been cleaning up the yard all morning in an attempt to regain normalcy. All water has receded, so I made a journey down the lane in my automobile at 1:17pm. As I drove down Beach Road I saw that houses were still standing, trees were still intact, and a few people were even frolicking with loved ones. When I pulled into 7-11, I made chit chat with several locals. We did not share the same story of physical and emotional abuse from Hurricane Sandy. I am shamed to inform you all that my reporting over the past 48 hours has ""apparently"" been exaggerated. It seems as if all is right in Fox Hill...and it has been this entire time. I thought you guys were cruel for the ""You're hilarious"" comments, but it now all makes sense. Thank you all for following me through MY journey. As heart breaking as it is to learn that I've been living in a state of delusion, it feels good to no longer survive off 1 can of beans and a gallon of water. If anyone sees Mother, please tell her I am done drinking RedBull and to come home. Stay SANE, America. ...Signing off."	t5_2qj17	True

From what I understand, Fairfax is a very expensive area (though we are moving from the SF Peninsula, so we're no stranger to high cost of living) but we are looking to move to a surrounding area, willing to go as far as 20 miles out to find the right town to live in.  Neither of us have ever been to Virginia, so naturally we have a lot of questions.  Any kind souls willing to give some advice?  Mainly, we are wondering:

- Are there any towns/areas to avoid due to high crime or just being a ""bad"" area?
- We are looking ideally to rent a single family home or townhouse, what is the best way to go about doing this?
- What is traffic like during commute times? If we live 10-15 miles outside of Fairfax, what would that commute be like?
- Are there any highly desirable areas as far as restaurants/culture?

Any of advice you have to give (whether related to those questions or otherwise) would be absolutely appreciated!

EDIT: Thank you all for so many fantastic and helpful responses! I am taking notes. :)

Another EDIT: I just wanted to say thank you again.  Thanks to all of you I now have a huge list of neighborhoods to check out, the names of 2 realtors, a decent knowledge of the area, and a growing excitement about moving to Virginia! Looking forward to moving out there!"	t5_2qj17	True

(x-post from /r/NOVA)	Eurynom0s	11	3	2	"Crossposting this here on the recommendation of someone from /r/NOVA that /r/Virginia would probably like to see this too.

Basically, here's what happened: Moved to the area a month ago. I had already paid a deposit when I got a letter about a week and a half ago telling me about my deposit and why I was going to have to pay it.

I wouldn't have been very perturbed at the general idea of having to pay a deposit, as I'm 23 years old without much rental/utility history. Except...the stated reason was a credit score in the mid-500's, which I knew couldn't be right unless I'd gotten dinged by a bunch of credit inquiries from my recent move.

When I called up about this, they rolled over pretty quickly about sending me a refund, which further reinforced my suspicion that this was ""let's charge a bunch of deposits and see if we come out ahead."" Furthermore I got the credit report I was entitled to from Experian from this (and Experian is apparently the credit agency they use to determine who needs to pay a deposit and who doesn't) and that had me at a much more respectable score, which makes sense given that I've always payed my credit card in full, on time, etc etc. But...it didn't do anything to explain where Dominion got such a low score for me from. Again, the only reason I was expecting a legitimate bad score was a flood of inquiries from my move, but that wasn't the case.

**tl;dr** Dominion seems to use credit scores pulled directly out of their ass when assessing who has to pay a deposit, so it's worth checking into if they did this to you."	t5_2qj17	True

After a great experience with them this afternoon, I wanted to let you know about a fantastic group called the Area Rehabbers Klub (ARK).

[The ARK website](http://www.arkofva.org/)

Today I found a baby squirrel in my yard who had fallen during the hurricane. He didn't seem to be injured, but his eyes were still closed and I knew there was no chance he would survive if I didn't get him to someone who knew what to do with him.

So I did some research, trying to find wildlife rehabilitators in the area. ARK was the closest I could find (and turned out to be very nearby). I called their hotline, left a message, and got a phone call from them just a few minutes later. The timing couldn't have been better; this woman was meeting up with a bunch of people with rescued squirrels in half an hour at a location about 20 minutes from my house.

I drove over to meet her, and she was incredibly friendly and helpful. I asked what their success rate was with these kind of rescues, and she told me it was 100%. I'm guessing that number might have been a bit north of reality, but I did get the impression that these folks do very good work.

[Oh, and here's a picture of the squirrel!](http://i.imgur.com/KABOT.jpg)

He's pretty much horrible, here are some of his positions on civil rights alone:

 * Voted NO on prohibiting job discrimination based on sexual orientation. (Nov 2007)
 * Voted YES on Constitutionally defining marriage as one-man-one-woman. (Jul 2006)
 * Voted YES on making the PATRIOT Act permanent. (Dec 2005)
 * Voted YES on Constitutional Amendment banning same-sex marriage. (Sep 2004)
 * Voted YES on constitutional amendment prohibiting flag desecration. (Jun 2003)
 * Voted YES on banning gay adoptions in DC. (Jul 1999)
 * Rated 7% by the ACLU, indicating an anti-civil rights voting record. (Dec 2002)
 * Rated 0% by the HRC, indicating an anti-gay-rights stance. (Dec 2006)
 * Amend Constitution to define traditional marriage. (Jun 2008) 

The other two candidates who will probably garnish a combined 2-4% of the vote out of sheer disgust of Goodlatte, are [Jeff Vanke](http://www.votesmart.org/npat.php?can_id=122934) of the Whig party, and [Stuart Bain](http://votesmart.org/npat.php?can_id=127231) of the Libertarian party.

Jeff Vanke is the moderate in the race, while there are a few small issues I disagree with him on, he is the only person close to a reasonable representative. Stuart Bain is just fucking nuts.

Bain wants to:

* Eliminate Agriculture Funding entirely
* Eliminate Arts Funding entirely
* Greatly Decrease Education Funding
* Greatly Decrease Environmental Funding
* Eliminate Medical research Funding entirely
* Eliminate Scientific research Funding entirely
* Greatly Decrease Space exploration research Funding
* Remove us from the United Nations
* Eliminating all taxes

""I do not support government intervention in free markets through bailouts, stimulus, subsidies, and Keynesian economics."" - Stuart Bain. Yes, this person is running for the U.S. Congress.

So, even though I disagree with Vanke on some small issues, he is really nothing near as bad as the other two. There is no way in hell he will win, but there is no harm in voting for him since there is no primary opposition to the 20 year incumbent Goodlatte (R)."	t5_2qj17	True

45 hours behind the wheel with a parent/guardian 15 of which must be at night,

I have the Drivers Education certificate, but the entire thing was in the classroom at my school, there was no driving involved. Is this all I need? Or is there another program I need to go through?

VA is somewhat close and further south which are two things that are important to me. But other than driving through the state recently on a road trip, I know nothing about it. 
So, now for the questions- 

--What are the winters like? I suffer from seasonal affective disorder and the winters in CT are crippling to me. I'm aware it still gets cold and it still snows, but in your personal opinion, how bad is it? How long do the very worst parts of winter last?

--Is it a very religious state? For the record I'm no atheist, but I believe in keeping religion somewhat private. My main concern is how accepting the people are toward other religions and those who identify themselves as LGBT? 

--How is the economy fairing there and in which towns does it seem best in? 

--What towns are safest, but still affordable? 

--What towns should I stay away from? (In terms of safety, lack of jobs, price, etc.) 

I can't think of anything else at the moment, and I'm appreciative of absolutely any information. Thanks, guys."	t5_2qj17	True

I filled in my candidate, and attempted to insert it into the little scan-tron box, but it wouldn't accept it.  I tried several times, and they weren't able to get it to work.  (Apparently I was the first one to use a paper ballot today.)

Eventually, they just opened up the side of the box, and had me drop in my ballot directly, bypassing the counter.  They said they would ""count it later"".

Are they likely to actually count my vote?  I suppose that would mean hand counting all the paper ballots again, since they aren't going to know which was mine.  (Of course, there may only be a couple of paper ballots at the end of the day, so maybe it isn't a big deal.)

1372448891.0	1h9o7t	I'm an incoming VT grad student. Would commuting from Roanoke/Salem to Blacksburg be crazy?	chebu	3	0	7	"Hi all!

I'm moving to Virginia in August to attend grad school and teach. I've had a really, really difficult time scheduling showings with people from across the country - despite sending out 40+ emails over the last month, I only have two showings set up for the two days I'll be in town.

I'm also just generally having a hard time finding available places in the Blacksburg/Christiansburg area that meet my needs, mostly because I'm 100% set on living in a single-family home, not a duplex/townhouse/condo/apartment, but I also don't need a huge amount of space (it's just me, my boyfriend, and our cats) or want to pay upwards of $1200 in rent.

So as a result, I've started considering living in the Salem/Roanoke area. There are lots of cute, cheap houses, and the landlords have been easier to get ahold of. But my question is whether commuting from that area would make me insane. I know the drive is long-ish, and that part I think I can handle. My concern is whether it will even be possible in the winter months. In Seattle, it's basically impossible to move around when it snows, because we don't plow the roads or have winter tires. I know that in Virginia, people are more equipped to deal with the snow. But it seems unlikely that the entire stretch of road between Roanoke/Salem and Blacksburg will be plowed.

My questions are:

1. Is this commute possible in the snow, in a small car (Mini Cooper) with chains?
2. How much of the year will it snow enough to make my commute a problem?
3. Do buses in Roanoke/Salem and the bus from Roanoke to Blacksburg (the Smart Way Commuter Bus) still run when it's snowy out?

Thank you so much for any insight you can offer!"	t5_2qj17	True

I'm subleasing my apartment b/c I'm pursuing a new job in another country.

It is a 1br apartment; 640sqft total, plus a balcony. The bedroom has a closet and a single bathroom. There's a kitchen and spacious living room.

It is located about one mile from Rt. 1 and I-95 and has free unassigned parking. The rent for a new unit is $750 but I signed the lease before they raised rent so you'll only be paying $695. The lease ends in May 2013.

Message me if you're interested, thanks."	t5_2qj17	True
