1358813549.0	170swl	American Horror Story: Carnival?	GlorieBee	177	18	64	"This may have already been brought up, but what about season 3 being a traveling carnival type thing? 

When I heard “I Put a Spell on You” and “Love Potion Number Nine” playing in back to back episodes I thought it was a hint for southern voodoo stuff. But doesn’t that fit a gypsy fortune telling carnival thing too? 

Then there was [this post]( https://twitter.com/AHStory/status/292344752634990592). Several cities? A carnival wouldn’t be rooted to one location, so that fits.

A carnival is a great set up for an ensemble cast, and would create a ton of different story lines to explore. 

[This article]( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/17/american-horror-story-season-3-ryan-murphy_n_2501216.html) has some more hints and they work with a carnival too. Something lighter? Something glamorous? Something that can exist in different time periods?

Maybe we’ll get American Horror Story: Carnival

I don’t know if I’m on to something or if this is just a case of wishful thinking.

The cast will be rounded out with new and old faces (some from season 1!).  Probably too early to tell if anyone else is coming back from season 2; after all, McDermott wasn't a lock for season 2 until it started filming.

1359037461.0	176uf8	Gotta lay out my disappointment  (SPOILERS)	muggletron	180	60	133	"I fell in love with the first season of this show, mostly because I love horror, and this was something that I'd never witnessed on TV before. Early in this season, I wasn't sold until 3 or 4 episodes in. Then we had murder, possession, aliens, mutants, skinning women, rape, nazis, nymphos, so much...

Then, last night happened. With the mass amount of fun we had through this season, to end it so rushed made me angry. Here are my points:

1. The aliens, just give us something, anything. Even if its just WHY Kit

2. Impostor Bloody Faces, seemed like a rushed wrap up 

3. Little serial killer girl, seemed like a big build up, committing an entire episode to her, for NOTHING.

4. Demon possession, so they pretty much made Mary Eunice a bitch for 5 episodes, and she raped the priest, then it wrapped REALLY quick.

5. Lee Emerson, pissed me off by forcing the Santa story line for the holidays, then he's just gone after F'ing up Timothy. (Also, Lee Emerson is the name of a politician for all of the Season 3 theorists) 

6. Arden's mutants, Shelley was turned into one, they were a massive plot line, and then BAM BAM BAM, all gone. The only purpose they served was to keep Lana and Kit from escaping one time.

7. Pepper, she's there, she's gone, she's back and smart, then she's just dead. That's it, just dead.

8. Monsignor Timothy, he brings Arden in, has Jude wrapped around his finger, gets raped by a demon, kills Shelley, and hides Jude away...and all we get is him committing suicide in past-tense? Talk about rushed.

9. Kit's new wife, so they were married, apparently never had sex since she didn't get taken, yet she's not involved in Kit's cancer treatment?

10. Kit's kids, HUGE story line, then ""oh, they turned out great"" seriously? 

11. Adam Levine, so the whole current-day Briarcliff scene was just a way to force the lead singer of a popular band into the show? The first scene with the camera on the phone didn't fit with the explanation of Bloody Face Jr at the end, he didn't even come at the camera from the angle of the phone, so nothing would have even shown on the screen like we were all shown. 

I want to keep going and picking other shit apart, but I'm getting angry again. The middle of this series was incredible, from mossy banks to colostrum, but after last night, they should have called it good after Spilt Milk, when Lana gave Threadson the finger, should have ended, we'd be left with as many unanswered questions, and wouldn't have had to sit through the forced, rushed, crap we were fed for the last 3 weeks.

I haven't crushed on a character like this since I was a preteen and I'm in my late 20s.  I'm not alone, right?  (I mean, not counting the imbalanced teen girls under the ""Thredson"" tag on Tumblr?)

**EDIT**

Hooray!  I'm not alone!  Something weird I'd like to throw out there is that Zachary Quinto normally doesn't do it for me, in any other role or as himself.  Just Oliver.  Is it weird to call him Oliver?  Who cares.  I'd offer to be strapped to that bed in the basement any day."	t5_2spug	True

&gt;“Kathy’s never [played] someone this bad,” ""AHS"" co-creator Ryan Murphy told TVLine. Just how bad? **Murphy said five times that of her infamous ""Misery"" character.**  Murphy revealed to TVLine that Bates was shocked when he talked about Season 3 because it was **a real historic event.**  According to The Hollywood Reporter, Murphy revealed at the Paley Center that Bates fits into the mold of his casting choices. ""It's no secret I love female Oscar winners,"" he said, adding, **""They did some real screwed up stuff in the 1800s.""**

Seems like a few clues.  I found this article on [prolific female serial killers](http://mentalfloss.com/article/20143/8-prolific-female-serial-killers) and this stood out, especially with everything we've speculated about New Orleans:

**1. DELPHINE LALAURIE**
**Estimated Body Count: **At least 10 (but possibly as many as 90)

**Story:** Delphine LaLaurie was the wife of a wealthy New Orleans physician in the early 1800s. With long black hair and porcelain skin, all eyes focused on her when she threw glamorous parties. Little did anyone know that the slightest mistake from a slave caused Madame LaLaurie to explode in rage. She was charged with cruelty against one of her slaves—when the slave allegedly pulled her hair while brushing it, LaLaurie beat her mercilessly in the garden. Another slave girl jumped to her death from a second floor window to escape Madame LaLaurie. In 1834, a fire ravaged the LaLaurie estate and after the firemen put out the flames, they smelled rotting bodies. Pushing open the attic door, they were startled to see dead slaves chained to the walls, a woman with her lips sewn shut, half-dead slaves in cages, a man who received a forced sex change, women without skin, eviscerated slaves, and body parts strewn about the attic.

**Capture:** The LaLauries escaped and were never seen again. Years later, during renovations, contractors discovered the bodies of slaves that allegedly had been buried alive.

**Punishment:** None, though superstitious locals claim Madame LaLaurie suffers the otherworldly punishment of haunting her home, wailing for relief in French.

So what do you guys think?  This could also be a role for Jessica Lange as it does seem to have some of that ""glamour cat"" appeal Ryan Murphy mentioned.  Any ideas on who Kathy Bates could be?"	t5_2spug	True

A lot of people seem really upset that the aliens and their purposes haven't been explained and is kinda left ""open"". But isn't that kind of the point? We're talking about some species that is, for lack of a better word, completely alien to us. Their reasons, if we were even capable of understanding them, may not even mean anything to us. To put it another way, their reasons are likely to be as alien as their origins.

On another note, the unknowable factor seems to be a huge part of the alien horror ""theme"". In no real-life alien abduction case is there ever a reason given to the victim(s). People are just yanked out of their day to day life by some vastly overpowering forces, which then proceed to do whatever they want with them before dumping them back *without* a reason. And if anything, that alone makes it all the more horrifying! Alma and Grace embodied that, in that there are two ways people can view abduction incidents. Grace thought it was an almost spiritual experience (and really, they brought her back to life so who could blame her?), while to Alma it was as horrific an experience as a person can go through, to the point of the idea of them returning driving her to murder. Grace claimed that they abducted them because of Kit and because he was ""special"", but is that a reason they themselves gave her or is that just conjecture on her part as a way to cope? There's no real evidence I've seen in the dialogue that either of them had any kind of dialogue WITH the aliens. The responses they had were solely their own responses to the situation.

Ultimately, I guess I'm just trying to say is: calm down, people! And try to appreciate the story for what it is."	t5_2spug	True

1353264392.0	13eoeg	Misogyny--a root of evil in the villains this season?	masagoroll	68	10	17	"I was just thinking about how many of the villains in this season show explicit hatred of women in their motives. I listed them out. 


Bloody Face--the arch-villain-- Specifically a killer and destroyer of women.

Arden--Has a literal virgin/whore complex, turned off by any woman who actually consents to sex, undermines Sister Jude's authority, mutilates Shelly.

The Monsignor--Allows all kinds of horrors to go on in the asylum by overruling and dismissing Sister Jude (who is also pretty bad, but is pointing out true problems).

Anne Frank's husband--Is pressured by society into mutilating and zombifying Anne/Charlotte to fit her into the terrifying Stepford wife mold.

Sister Jude--Sterilizes Grace against her will, treats Shelly, Lana, and the other patients abusively. (Because a woman can be misogynistic, too.)

The aliens (or whatever they are)--Only interested in keeping/probing women for their specific reproductive purposes.


The bad stuff in the show clearly does NOT only affect women, since Kit, Adam Levine's character, and the male patients of Briarcliff have lots of bad shit happen to them as well. Everyone has lots of horror in American Horror Story! But it seems like an unusual amount of the evil people in this season have the roots of their neuroses in true hatred for women. 

Of course, this analysis leaves out the homophobia (in all the stuff that happened to Lana and Wendy) and the helpless situation of the abused mentally ill people that also provides a lot of the true-life horror of this season. 

This season really creeps me out because so many of the things in it really did happen in the past. Real people are capable of the scariest evil. "	t5_2spug	True

For those too lazy:

Moira herself explains the age discrepancy: Women see who she really is (an old soul); men see what they want to see (a sex object).

As for her eye, Frances Conroy's actual milky eye was used in the story. Constance shot her in that eye when she murdered Moira. Men, not wanting to acknowledge any of her actual past, would naturally not see sexy Moira with the milky eye. Women, seeing who she truly is, see the eye the bullet went through as milky, because Moira's murder is essential to her character.

Two of the songs listed in the jukebox are from the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical [South Pacific](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pacific_(musical)). One of the characters in the musical is named ""Bloody Mary.""
While this may seem like just a coincidence, Rodgers and Hammerstein are also referenced during Jude's movie night monologue. During her monologue, Jude quotes ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" from the musical [Carousel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carousel_(musical)).

I think it's a pretty safe assumption that Murphy is purposely hinting something with these references. The legend of Bloody Mary is heavy with rituals and summoning, which can certainly fit in with the speculation of voodoo in the next season.

What do you guys think? Do you think Bloody Mary will play a role in season 3?

As a side note (though I may just be grasping at straws here), Rodgers and Hammerstein also wrote a musical called [The Sound of Music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_of_music), which prominently features both nuns and Nazis."	t5_2spug	True

Having sex with other women.  and we haven't seen him, because he's been in the rubber suit, ergo  constance's dead husband fucked Vivian and is the father to the baby

I think the aliens have returned Pepper, Alma, and Grace with each other's brains. We saw in this last episode that they were able to take the baby out of the womb and it was fine, I wonder if they have little use for bodies of humans and are just looking at the brains. 

Ok, hear me out.

The first to be abducted that we've seen was Alma, she was there alone, until they picked up Pepper and Grace later. They may have put their bodies in storage (the water) until they needed to take them back to our world. My thought is that Grace has Alma's brain, Pepper has Grace's brain, and Alma has Pepper's brain.

Evidence:

- Grace mentions that they're not perfect.

- Pepper suddenly is much more coherent as we've all noted.

- Pepper's claim that her brother in law killed her child is basically the same as Grace's claim about her crime.

- Grace screamed when she saw Alma in the water, you would scream too if you saw your body floating in magic water across from you.

-  We have yet to hear Alma speak after she is now back.

- We know Grace gets angry in the next episode but it may be because of this.

But I thought it'd be fun to start hearing everyone's ideas on what Season 3 might entail. I know Ryan Murphy already said he was going to hide a clue in the finale, again (which I know we'll all be looking for).  Murphy is pretty cunning, though, and I have a feeling he has planted other clues.


Here's my theory for those who are interested: I think Season 3 could be set in New Orleans, around the early 1900s.  It would be an interesting time to explore, given there were still overwhelming racial/class tensions, and it was a major time for VooDoo, Black Magic etc.  The only reason why I think this is because of the seemingly random references to France/French Culture in this season.  All I've noticed so far are: the song ""Dominique,"" the fact that Grace was from France and spoke French even though she grew up on a midwestern farm, and when Thredson was making Lana a ""Croque Monsieur"" in the doom basement.  To me, the French things just seem out of place for Boston in the '60s, so I have a feeling they are put there on purpose.

Well beyond playing the episode’s namesake 'The Name Game' song, it also clearly displayed in bold, white lettering the word CONGRESS. ""Pfft, but that's just the name of the record label"" you scoff. Maybe so my friends, maybe so. But between these two seasons, during these many episodes of AHS I have learnt one very important lesson - no detail is too small, too insignificant to be left unscrutinised.


Having said that, I offer you Exhibit B. a scene in which we find the Monsignor in his room, on bended knee, praying fervently. Not an implausible scenario by any stretch of the imagination but what exactly is he uttering? It’s the ['Armor of God'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armor_of_God) - a completely appropriate piece of scripture to recite when preparing yourself to go into battle with evil. Now here's where it gets interesting; Sister Mary Eunice enters, joins in the recitation, eventually taking over from the Monsignor 'For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.' Intriguing turns of phrase don’t you think? Principalities, rulers of this world and wickedness in high places... Hmmm.


There has been much talk of Rome and the Monsignor’s ambition to rise through the hierarchy of the Church/Vatican could this possibly carry over into next season? Being that it’s unlikely AHS would go overseas to Rome, how might such a theme translate to America?


Which brings me to Exhibit C. an [interview in which Ryan Murphy](http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/01/03/american-horror-story-ryan-murphy-the-name-game-exclusive/) in which he states he wants to do something with a bit more ‘evil glamour’ this season including another Romeo &amp; Juliet type storyline and is contemplating shooting it in a place in the country where true horror has been. I believe the political climate of Washington lends itself nicely to all the above criteria: the glamorous yet scandalous times of Kennedy’s Camelot, young lovers forbidden to cross their family’s staunch party lines and as for true horror... injustices, abuses of power, incompetence and corruption have the capacity to devastate and even destroy lives, potentially on a mass scale. And we all know Murphy loves to grind a political axe or two. 


In summation (TL;DR) an AHS set in Washington DC opens up the potential for a season 3 filled with conspiracy theories, secret societies, rituals, sacrifices, murder, Faustian bargains, greed, decadence, power struggles, corruption, lust, sex and scandal ...Are you not entertained?

I enjoyed it, it was dark, but not really scary, and it had some good plot twists that were original. Overall, I liked it, but it was not the best thing I had ever seen. I started Season 2, and immediately, it grabbed me in a way the first didn't. Everything about this season was fantastic. It terrified me, baffled me, gripped me, and spat me out feeling empty, but in a good way. I cannot stress enough how perfect it was. Especially the second half, where it evolves from a supernatural thriller into something so deep and intense I cannot explain it. 

I am normally not really affected by tv or movies very much, but this one got me. Being gay and struggling with mental health issues, it just seemed to scream at me that I would be there somewhere. And in the second to last episode, where Jude is in the institution for years and it is so crowded and vile, I couldn't handle it and had to just stop and go make tea and think about nothing for a half hour. 

And I love how it didn't give a fuck about conventions. It kept seeming to sever plotlines halfway through, and in episode 11 I was sure I had skipped a few episodes and somehow had gotten to the finale early. And it didn't feel like it had to spoon feed the audience explanations. It never said what the aliens were or why they were there. The Devil never explained a master plan. And I didn't really understand the ending, but it is somehow okay. 

I just feel drained. I don't know if I have ever been this affected by a TV show.

Right now the whole alien presence/story just line feels like it serves no purpose at all and was just sprinkled on just so the show can have them. I mean what happened to that little spider robot thingy that Dr Arden took out of Kit? Thats' it? Really?

1358438442.0	16r8oz	Was anyone else disappointed in this week's episode in comparison to last week's ep?	TheWackyGuru	42	7	28	"I love AHS and I've been following it since I first started watching Season 1.  I loved Nip/Tuck, sorta liked Glee for a while.  Last week's episode was flawless (though I felt the intro was a bit rapid, but that may have been the point).  There were great artistic (and daring) shots and I really dug it.  

This week's script had a lot of writing no-no's, I felt.  Instead of showing things happening, they just told the viewer what was happening.  It felt a bit spoon-fed and all the artistic and visual notions that graced the last few episodes were gone.  It felt different in a bad way.  In my opinion, the later half of the episode was getting progressively worse in comparison to the first half, a decent side-arc with Alma/Grace/Kit.  

The dutch angles were glaringly obvious instead of subtle as they should be.  I may have just noticed it more because of my disappointment with the episode overall.  

I may just be a bit picky because of my immense satisfaction with last week's episode, but it felt like a total dive in quality in comparison.  I know some people here liked this week's ep as well, and it was still good story-wise, but some of the things (as I illustrated above) rubbed me the wrong way viewer-wise."	t5_2spug	True

So I watched AHS, season 1, on Netflix and then got the second season. I'm pretty late to the party, but I finished in time for Coven, which is good enough for me!

Like any normal human being, I had a couple of problems with the second season, but when I love a show I really *love* a show, and I'm instantly bias and defensive.

With that said, I didn't mind the **aliens**.

Yes, it could have been left out *completely*, and yes it was a little under-developed. The reason I don't have a huge problem with the aliens is because at some point after Sister Mary Eunice was possessed it made me wonder this: if there is a power higher than us (e.g. God &amp; Satan), but simultaneously in the same universe there are higher intelligence beings (e.g. aliens) what power does the aforementioned hold over the latter? Obviously not much. So I thought that was a little interesting to mull over throughout.

**Sister Mary Eunice**: Anyone else a little pissed that that was it for Sis ME and Satan? After all her badassery and how weak Monsignor Timothy was and continued to be, all it took was that one moment for him to push her right over the edge. I figured the demon could have secretly passed on into Monsignor or Arden or *anyone*!

**Grace and Alma**: Grace was the single link to the aliens that intrigued me (aside from what I said earlier). She had a connection and seemed to know where to go with it, but rather than expand on that they axe her in the back. So ironic, you guys. And Alma... we get her pregnant, we abduct her for the majority of the season, bring her back, have her kill Grace, and send her to Briarcliff to *die*.

**Kit Walker**: aliens like and want him... why's that again?

**Lana Winters**: An ultimate evil bad guy. A very intelligent and great character, but honestly I felt a little duped at the end. We got that one flashback scene with Sister Jude talking about staring into the face of evil and a little eyebrow twitch from Lana, and then nothing. I remember her quip about always wanting to be in the mind of a killer, but I didn't feel enough satisfaction as to why she was like that? 

These are just a few things I felt like pointing out. None of this ruined a single thing about the series for me. Great season! Good stuff :)

That is probably because I was reading reviews prior to watching the series to see what the general consensus on it was. Metacritic gave it a 62, which kind of made me sad since the story and theme looked so amazing. I then decided to read some reviews and noticed that most people thought the show was just a jumbled mess within the first 3 episodes and that they refused to watch any further. But I decided to watch on anyways because screw it! I don't really follow other peoples reviews anyways! And boy was that a good decision. I just finished episode 10 and my mind is about to explode from everything that is going on. After lurking around this sub for a while I noticed that many people believe that season 2 is much better than the first. This is making me very anxious to just finish up this season and start the next already. I have to say that I rank this show's season 1 over The Walking Dead's Season 1. I actually want to say that up to episode 10 I have enjoyed this series more than The Walking Dead.

1354301958.0	142bq4	of angels and aramaic REDUX! now with extra accuracy!	macandobound	36	6	10	"So, previously I had been talking about how the angel of death was called ""Shachach"", from ""to bow down"", etc. I didn't find any figures in the canon, specifically any angelic figures, called ""Shachach"", but I figured Ryan Murphy was doing what he does and drawing from traditions with slight amendments.
 Thanks to Veev777 and redditors with captions/who wait ten seconds for people to put screenshots up so they don't make themselves look stupid, it's pretty clear that the name is actually ""shacha*t*"", which makes a whole shit ton more sense. 
I was confused as to what the writing actually said, since the letters Chet and Tav look very similar generally, especially when written on a wall in blood from a schizophrenic dude's wrist...and Francis Conroy's American-ass accent did not help me suss out the name when she said it...but now that I look at them closer, the written letters are definitely ""Shin"" ""Chet"" ""Tet"". 

Shachat means ""destroyer"" (""shochet"" is butcher in Hebrew, a derivitive). Shachat would make a lot more sense in terms of the mythology: it is the manifestation of god/the angel (the two are kindof blurrily defined in traditional judaism) which smites the firstborn egyptians in Exodus, which God keeps the Israelites safe from with the whole ""lamb blood on the doorway"" trick. 

Interesting points about Shachat and the character in the show:
In the Jewish tradition, names are absolutely essentially important. The world was brought into creation by being named. Peoples destinies are formed by the inclusion or exclusion of single letters in their names. This is especially true for the names of angels and the names of God. I'm betting (/hoping) Ryan Murphy did his homework on this and named Shachat deliberately. There are many other angels of destruction and death within Judaism, but Shachat only comes up once, in Exodus. The actual character Shachat in the show seems to be an amalgamation of many kinds of angels of death/destruction (foremost among which are Malachei HaMavet, literally ""Angels of Death"", mentioned in various parts of the Tanach as well as the Mishnah, Talmud, and various Kabbalistic tracts.) With death angels, there are some things traditionally to keep in mind:
a) the soul escapes from the mouth, where it sounds out from one end of the earth to the other but is not heard (pretty pertinent for the asylum, eh?)
b) traditionally, the angel of death has a sharp sword, which it is thought to use because it is the most humane way to kill, like a kosher butcher. so even though she isn't using the sword here, she *is* showing some of that mercy
c) using the kiss instead of the sword, as well as her appearance as a calming, matronly woman (in a fucking BALLER dress btw), makes sense because angels of death in the tradition take whatever form best suits their needs. though i think this could have been played with more (ie, she could appear to each person as the most calming figure in their lives), i get why they kept with just one actress. 

What I find interesting is the name, and what specifically the name was picked to say. In the Exodus story, Shachat is an indifferent, immovable force. It will literally kill anything in its path that is not marked with the blood. it sees no difference between the egyptian and the jew, which is why the jews were commanded so vehemently to put the blood up on their houses. There are Midrashim that talk about Jews who didn't think it was such a big deal who didn't put blood on their houses and got straight up firstborn KO'd by the indifferent death ghost. What this says about the character is interesting: while she has the element of mercy mentioned above, she also has the complete, almost cruel indifference of death itself. In Judaism by and large, angels are not friends to humans: though they do show favor on the occasional patriarch or righteous man, they are generally disdainful/resentful of humankind, and do not give a single shit about killing them if commanded. Though this is sometimes the case regarding angels in Christianity, Christian angels are usually more loving to humans (actually, scratch that, more loving to obedient CHRISTIAN humans. more wielding of the fiery sword toward unsaved and/or sinful humans.) The melding of the two here is interesting, I think.

There was an actual horrific asylum on the east coast called Willowbrook run by the church in the 60s that had deplorable conditions and there was a real life tv expose on it (that Lana's expose looks VERY similar to) that got the place shut down. After the place was shut down it became the home of a Staten Island urban legend about an inmate called 'Cropsey' that is synonymous with the Bogeyman. 

The other big similarity is that there is a serial killer, largely believed to be Andre Rand though that still is not 100% confirmed, who is a serial killer that is connected to the Willowbrook school.

The documentary is on Netflix and I'd highly recommend it! Especially if you found the setting and story of season 2 intriguing.

I would appreciate any further development because right now I'm going off strictly memory. 

The aliens were not aliens but were.......... Angels!

Spoilers below!

The end scene revealed that Lana was evil. Sister Jude could recognize her evil, because she herself was evil. Jude was evil throughout the first half of the season because she hadn't seen the aliens. Once she was exposed to them, she became a different person, more righteous, and even sought out her past and attempted to reconcile/repent for it. 

Dr. Arden did not see the aliens, but was still exposed to them and thus shattered his view of the world (and religion) and he went searching for the truth, which ultimately was futile. 

Grace was brought back by aliens and felt guilt for her past and attempted to connect/get closer to them. 

Alma however chose the opposite path and turned away from them, which caused her to become evil (and she killed *Grace*). 

In tonights episode it was revealed that in the woods Sister Jude had a ""rebirth"" and almost a religious experience and revival. 

Kitt was assumed into heaven, and thus explains the disappearance. 

Like i said any input appreciated, even if it shoots down the theory!

TL;DR: the aliens are Angels "	t5_2spug	True

Let's discuss theories here!  We must all be on the lookout!

**CURRENT THEORIES FOR SEASON 3**

* something of French origin [due to these recurring motifs](http://www.reddit.com/r/AmericanHorrorStory/comments/1563vz/recurring_motif_this_season_spoilers_for_asylum/c7js0bd)
* the Deep South - plantations, slavery, etc (many people have noticed elements of voodoo and hints towards African heritage)


My best guess so far with all I've learned is that it might be set on a plantation in Louisiana - it's the only thing that covers all the different clues we've picked up this season.


**EDIT POST-EPISODE**

I'm really thinking we've got it nailed with the Louisiana voodoo theme.  I think the clue was ""I Put A Spell On You"".  Also, I read on IMDB that Jessica Lange just purchased a house in New Orleans!

**UPDATE**

Just found [this article](http://www.inquisitr.com/466675/american-horror-story-season-3-ryan-murphy-dishes-on-spoilers-already/#lwxQOmT0f8vY6SeZ.99 ) where Ryan Murphy says this:

I, for one, extremely hope Violet sits them both down, logically explains the mechanics of the house to them, gives proof in the form of showing them the other ghosts, and then leads them down to the basement to show them her decaying body. Violet will them sit them both down again and proceed to answer all their questions and comforts them in their greif.

While I found this season to be a lot more brutal and a hell of a lot creepier (as well as getting away from the baby craziness that made me rather nauseous throughout the first season) I found that it was a lot messier. After all, you have aliens, possession, creepy *the Hills Have Eyes* creatures running around in the woods, a serial killer, corruption in the church... And it felt like so much of it was left unresolved or it was resolved in a way that was anti-climatic. 

After all, the devil was defeated by simply killing Sister ME and Arden just gave up. Kit's children became very successful in life but their lives were relatively normal. Of course Kit does disappear but... Even that seems rather ho-hum too. Had Alma not been killed we might have been given some more insight into the aliens, but of course she was put on the chopping block. 

The serial killer plotline was honestly probably the one I liked the best and that seemed to have the best ending and honestly everything else could have been really toned down (maybe with the exception of Arden's experiment although I felt like his Nazi history was brought up as a major plot point and never really dealt with which was also frustrating.)

1357229767.0	15w5y4	Two very small changes that would have really elevated this episode... (spoilers)	kaijunexus	38	12	28	"1. The two words Judy said to Monsignor should have been ""Save her"", rather than ""kill her"".  I feel like Judy's hate for the devil shouldn't extend to hate for Mary Eunice.  Judy, despite what she's been through, should still want to save the innocent nun that she obviously cared for in the beginning of the season.

2. Sister Mary Eunice should have thrown herself from the staircase...not Monsignor.  This would have completed both of their character arcs.  

Mary Eunice started this season as a naive and innocent girl lacking confidence.  She has now spent months fighting the devil itself within her...and losing.  What she should have gained, however, is the courage to do what she knows she must.  In her quick moment of clarity, she should have taken her own life to end the suffering of so many others...thus establishing herself as the selfless hero.

Monsignor, however, has shown himself to be an utter failure this entire season.  He failed to see Judy's affection for him, failed to keep Doctor Arden from continuing his experiments, failed to rehabilitate the ""Chritmas Killer"" (his name escapes me at the moment), and failed to trust in Sister Jude when she told him the devil was inside Mary Eunice.

Last night's episode should have been his most epic and final failure...his failure to save Mary Eunice, especially at Judy's request.  This would have really broken him and filled him with incredible guilt as he's now failed everyone around him completely."	t5_2spug	True

May be towards the end of the season Sister Mary Eunice finally dies/ the devil is exorcized around the same time that Lana gives birth..causing the demon to posses the baby, seeing as the devil did state he is a big fan of bloody faces work.

In my opinion, Vivien and Violet Harmon are the only truly ""good"" persons in this. You could argue that some of the dead kids (especially Beauregard) are good also, but we don't see them enough to really know.  
   
In my POV, Tate is the only truly vile person in the show. He has no remorse and is a selfish liar. Hayden crosses a line somewhere and become pure evil also. Again, some of the not-very-seen characters could be worse (Thaddeus, anyone?) but among the fleshed-out  ones, these two take the cake.  
  
Ben is interesting. In a way I grew to hate him, but his family ultimately loves him, so...?  
  
The rest are ""just"" mad, or have some kind of motive for their twisted behavior. Chad especially strikes me as an essentially good person who's just been driven over the edge, and I guess that Constance had too much suffering in her life to see clearly when she chose to adopt The Antichrist (I can't believe I'm typing these words.)

Kits girlfriend showing up pregnant makes me believe they impregnated Grace (telling her not to struggle, so I would assume it was the same procedure) and, while it didn't show much of Jude's interaction, I think they did the same to her. Grace, when she starts showing, will make others assume it is Kits while Jude will think hers is from a one night stand. Next, I bet that Arden will perform an abortion on Grace, finding an Alien baby. Jude, who has been mentally beating herself up thinking it was that man's baby tries to destroy it with alcohol. Where it goes from there I don't know, but I think that may be what is being set up.

Also, in a previous post that pointed out foreshadowing in this seasons poster, Jude has her hands over her stomach, which may point to the pregnancy.

1351860264.0	12if0u	Sister Mary Eunice and Aliens (Spoilers)	phattsao	26	4	16	"I have a few observations and a thought regarding my favorite possessed nun.  

In Episode 3, Sister Mary is completely possessed by the devil.  The interesting thing, to me, is that she seemingly made no effort to hide this from anyone.  From the get-go she is acting completely out of character when announcing the movie.  She doesn't deny anything to the Mexican woman who sees her for what she is.  Then she gets on Sister Jude's case with the lipstick.  Then Dr. Arden.  Then she's watching the Christians die with glee.  

The point I took from that, is that she IS the devil, and doesn't care who knows.  She tells no lies, she is simply doing her evil thing.

So, what does this have to do with the alien?  Well, at the end, Sister Jude wakes up and says ""They saw it too?!"".   

Sister Mary Eunice, looking a little perplexed, replies ""Saw what, sister?"".

To me, based on the previous 60 minutes of ""Diablo Truth"", that implies that the Devil really DOESN'T know about the alien.  If the Devil was aware of it, he might have teased Sister Jude more, or dropped a hint to her fate, or done something mean spirited, the way he'd been doing all episode.

So if the devil doesn't know about the alien, it's also very possible that the devil HAS NO POWER over the alien.  That could lead to some very interesting situations in future episodes.

This is all just my crackpot theory, but if they do indeed go that route, I'll be pleased.  The Devil vs Aliens....that's something I haven't seen before.   "	t5_2spug	True

I know, the demon baby is probably going to die or something, so this probably isn't that important, but wow.

I mean, when I first started watching it I hated it, haha. But I couldn't stop watching because the story was just really intriguing and I wanted to know what happened next. Did anyone else have that same feeling? And obviously when I had questions, I went to reddit to answer those questions...but then I spoiled half of the plot lines for myself along the way. Also, it just seemed like a couple of the story plots were pointless and not fluid with the rest of the series, and that kind of bothered me a bit. That and I thought they dragged out the ending, but at the same time the very last part was pretty solid and a fair way to end the season.

I do have to say though, it made me cry a lot. I don't know why, but I just started bawling when the box containing jars of a dismembered Thaddeus arrived. Not saying that any normal person wouldn't react that way, but it just affected me so suddenly that I surprised myself. And the storyline with Violet and Tate just made me cry a lot as well.

(SPOILERS) 	poosyslayer	24	2	8	"After my post from last night about the whole Constance stating to Ben it's not your time/ it is your time got such good feedback, I figured I'd post something else I noticed. Sorry if this has already been posted, I didn't browse through all the pages on this page to see if it already had been.

In the commercial for AHS where it shows all of the characters, when Vivian is touched by the Rubber suit man while she is peeling off the wallpaper, you can easily see a face a blonde boy with a look of horror on his face. I can only assume it is Tate by the similarities the two show. Also, overlooking Tate on the mural on the wall, is a demonic type figure. In hindsight, this makes total sense of why the demon would be overlooking Tate seeing that he has graced Vivian with the anti-Christ.

Also, in the final picture where the entire cast is sitting in the same room, Tates face is again seen on the mural where the piece of torn wallpaper shows him. Tate is fixed above Vivian's head if anyone is trying to go back to take a look.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84Bw_ArccSc&amp;feature=related.  In this link, you can see Tate in the mural under the wallpaper at :17, and then in the final scene above Vivian at :26.


I wonder if Tate being fixed in the mural underneath the wallpaper has anything to do with earlier in the season when Vivian is peeling off the wallpaper to show the mural, doesn't Constance come in and tell Vivian that the mural that is hidden was a beautiful mural? My memory fails me on this, but if it is Constance that states the mural is beautiful, I find it ironic that she would state a mural with her sons face on it with a demon (presumably the Devil) overlooking him is beautiful given her Christian faith.

1358899272.0	17374u	Ending Twist *speculation and spoilers*	kibben	24	4	25	"I think that in the final episode that we will discover that Lana actually kept Bloodyface's child.  When she was breastfeeding him, you see her hand kind of shoot out in disgust and then gently close around to cradle the baby.  I think that her maternal feelings will kick in without her permission and that she wasn't able to give the child up.  This also fits in with her martyr like attitude from last week's episode - yes, part of it is the fame, but I think part of it as well is self-satisfaction that she thinks she's such a good person and hero for keeping the baby.

We will discover this when the Son of Bloodyface goes to confront her.  He will be crushed because this has been his identity for so long (I believe that he is the one in the modern-day asylum killing people as Bloodyface.)  We will then discover that he is really Kit and Grace's son.  And that his murderous tendencies are no more than Grace's inherited murderous tendencies expressed when she snapped and killed her family.

This is backed up from last week's episode when Alma was fighting with Grace and slapped her - for the entire conversation, Grace had murderous flashes in her head, proving that what happened to her family wasn't just a one time snap, but that these tendencies were still a part of her.  And therefore, something she could pass down to her child.

From Tate's perspective, he wouldn't have realized that Violet discovered he is a ghost because that would mean he would have to know he is dead as well. So what is the context of his use of ""evolve""? 
Has she become more aware of the paranormal or has she evolved because she is now dead and joined the club of house ghosts and Tate can pick up on that.

The show keeps repeating the theme that everyone dies in the house. We know Constance isn't dead, but she definitely is connected to the house in more ways than one. I figure the Harmons are all ""going to die in there"" in order to keep the rules of the house consistent.

First is about Hayden - can she leave the house? There's the time when she's terrorizing Vivien and the security guy drives her away in his car, and that little montage that she narrates talking about adjusting to being dead: in one of those scenes, she's having sex with some guy, stabs him, and then he asks if she wants anything from the kitchen (making it feel like she's not at the house, rather in his house). This can't all possibly happen on Halloween. Also, why can she kill Constance's boytoy? In that sex scene, it looks like she stabs a guy but it doesn't hurt him...or was that just a fantasy?

Second question, and this one honestly bothered me most - where the hell is Constance's husband? She shot him and the maid (no clue how to spell her name, sorry) when she caught them together, and the maid came back like everyone else because she died in the house. But the husband died right next to her and he's nowhere to be seen! Am I missing something? Did they explain that?

In love takes pride

To be silent, dignity

Learn from at the right time

Hide his evil smile

And I thought walking

I knew from that time

If my heart is desperate

He did not see me cry will


A refrain ran into the street

Jostling passers

Who slipped into the crowd

From a small air engaging

I was on its way

He stopped in front of me

And told me to be wise

""You're sad, my God, why?

Come and enter my song

There are beautiful boys ...

Throw your grief in the stream

And turns her back ... ""


We need your verse is gay

So let's talk in May

Trees in lilac dress

And was pushing heap

Y violets, balcony

An old poet sings a song

My dress is stained sun

I care for my awakenings


A refrain ran into the street

Jostling passers

Who slipped into the crowd

From a small air engaging

People on the move

Looked surprised look

Ceased their chatter

""What is this ill-mannered?""

Yes, but the air was causing

And engaging words

And most importantly, there was in

Laughter at close range ...


If this air running in the street

Can chase your troubles

Then enter in the crowd

Y instead of pushing ...

1321633863.0	mh1dq	The Ghosts (or My Theories on Why They Are the Way They Are)	PollyNo9	21	6	18	"I've been thinking about the ghosts and why they are the way they are. Moira being sometimes old, Tate not remembering the circumstances of his death or life, etc. This is what I've come up with:

**Moira**: Died just about as powerlessly as one can. She was being raped and then another woman, who should have been sympathetic was the one who actually killed her. Now all Moira wants is to be free of the house, so she exerts the only power she feels she has (her youthful version) to get things from men. I think she is fairly neutral on her own,  as long as she is getting her own way, but is compelled by men (who she fears deep down) and Constance in particular (because Constance murdered her).

**Tate**:  I think since he essentially committed suicide (by cop, because there's no sane way he would have thought he could shoot his way out) I think he is mostly unaffected by the house's power. He is trapped there, but now that Violet is there he doesn't really mind. I'm not sure he even appeared to the Chad and Patrick, possibly because he didn't want anything from them or feel any connection to them. I also think that Tate wasn't in control of himself when he did the shootings and that is why he doesn't remember them, except in flashes. (inconsistency I noticed: the goth-y victim says he asked her if she believed in god, but during the playback of it, you can't hear him say anything, and in fact there doesn't seem to be enough time for any communication between them).

**Chad and Patrick**: These guys are also fairly trapped in their pre-death emotions. Chad is ONLY concerned with getting the house to look just right, and Patrick is all tied up in his inability to be faithful, and his guilt on that front (he seems truly sorry that he can't change when he says ""I can't help it"").

**Nora and Charles**: We haven't seen Charles yet, and I don't think we will, because he seemed perfectly content when Nora shot him, she had just fulfilled his desire to be seen as a competent man. Nora, in choosing to die, remains somewhat outside of the house's power, like Tate does. She did feel guilty though about all those abortions, and so is intent on helping Vivienne (and by extension her family). Also, I think that the Infantata is the cause of all of it, and since they died before it did (for the second time) they are less controlled by it.

**The ginger twins**: They died causing trouble, and being mostly mischievous, so they are mischievous in death.

**Beau**: My opinion (we don't have too much to go on here) is that he was good natured in life, and so, is good natured in death. Possibly he was too simple to understand that he was being killed, and is also too simple to be angry about it, and (I think) too simple for the house to use him for anything much. I don't think the time he appeared to Violet, that he was trying to scare her, I think he was trying to play with her now that Addy is gone.

Many of the theories I have seen about **Rubber Man** also work into this: If he died having sex, his spirit is caught in a sex loop. On the You're going to die in there site, someone was taking pictures of the BDSM couple, it could totally be pre-death **Rubber Man**.

**The nurses**: Died afraid and unknowing, they are only used by the house to scare others and don't act of their own volition.

**Hayden** was completely obsessed with pregnancies before she died, and obviously (from the promo videos) will continue to be so. 

**The murder enthusiasts**: I think they pretty much got what they wanted, and were so detached from reality that they also aren't of much use to the house, other than as scare tactics.

Anyone I missed? Thoughts?"	t5_2spug	True

1358629880.0	16w6zx	(Spoilers!)  Finale Theory!! Hear me out guys! And share yours!	noodle57	23	6	21	"Okay so just judging from the preview for next week, and a few of the articles others have posted here, I have a slightly far fetched theory.  

We all know that Teresa will be there in the finale, (...I know.) and the last time she was even mentioned was after the ""imposters'"" bodies were found and BF jr was speaking with the authorities on the phone.  An interview with Jenna Dewan-Tatum said she's still alive, so what if BF jr is sort of holding her hostage somewhere in Briarcliff and demands the authorities bring Lana to him?? He's been trying to track her down, why not have her delivered to him?  The finale shows Lana back at Briarcliff, although I think she looks a little too young for it to be current day, so I'm assuming she feels guilty and goes back for Jude after the conversation with Kit in the teaser.  

There is also the alien abduction, I can't imagine that it is anyone besides Kit when he dies.  I say that only because only 1 character lives according to RM, and as much as I wish he lives, I don't think he makes the cut.  

I'm sure none of this is right, because it's AHS, and if you can guess the finale, then you're a god damn mind-fuck genius.  Still fun to discuss though!

What are your finale theories?? Who do you think is going to be the lone survivor, or the lone acceptor of Death's Kiss? "	t5_2spug	True

*  Why are some ghosts able to roam away from the house?
*  After everything that happened to the Harmons why the fuck have they not invested in a gun?
*  How are the ghosts capable of killing the living?
*  Why is Ben, the psychiatrist, avoiding the fact that, in his mind, he has been hallucinating ghosts, sleep walking, etc?
*  How is a ghost, Tate, capable of getting Vivian pregnant?
*  Why is Moira the only one to have two different appearances to the two opposite sexes?
*  Why don't the ""kinder"" ghosts, or Moira, tell the Harmons about what is actually happening in the house?
*   Why does Hayden remember her past but Nora Montgomery doesn't?
*  How the fuck did Vivien not realize that the man in the bondage suit wasn't her husband?  Not only is she his wife and would probably differentiate sex between her husband and a stranger but Ben also has a completely different body frame than Tate.
*   How do the ghosts control when they appear and when they don't and why can the Harmon ghosts simply tell Tate and Hayden to ""go away"" and they disappear?

20:00 is about midway through the show - about 3 white lines on the play bar over.  




Transcript of the clip for those who can't watch:

Jude is in the common room, passionately talking to the Monsignor.

Jude: ""It's an extraordinary thing, you know that? You throw me in the madhouse. You strip away everything I have, everything I know. You treat me like a rabid dog...""

The Monsignor tries to soothe Jude by placing  his hands on her shoulders but she shoos him off of her.

Jude: ""... Like a madwoman! And you know what happens? I'm blessed... with the gift of total clarity. I am more sane now as a madwoman than I ever was as the head of Briarcliff.""

1351206670.0	123dmh	There's nothing in the woods...	Mstoner82	19	2	9	"I think the woods themselves are alive, and I think maybe I may have come to this conclusion by analyzing the awesomely cringe-worthy ""mossy bank"" quote.

So I was pretty disappointed last night, and I posted in one of the recap threads as to why, so I won't get into it too much here, but a friend of mine who didn't even know wtf reddit was (for shame!) was talking with me about how the quote was just dumb...then it hit me: The dude is OBSESSED with plants. From his introduction, he has always had plants/interacted with plants at some point.  

The first time we meet Dr. Arden, he is going on and on about his plants, and how he created a hybrid flower that didn't exist.  I passed most of this off as just ""yeah, dude's got to move on to humans,"" at first, which I don't think is totally false, but I didn't think of plants with human features.  Anyhow, he has a deep attachment to the woods, and something living there that was being fed, which led me to believe that there was some sort of sasquatch or something living in there, mainly because I figured he was feeding ""Bloody Face.""

But then it hit me hard when I was ranting about ""Mossy Banks.""  Dude has a CRAZY obsession with the woods, so much so that when the younger sister (can't remember her name,) goes out there, he goes OFF on her for it.  Why?  I think because he doesn't want her to find the plant man; the ""Tree of Life,"" if you will. This is where things get a little odd, but bear with me.  

So last night in the discussion thread, we were talking about how sex and religion are tied together so closely, and the struggle between science/religion and how it was all a crazy battle. What if the candy apple the Dr. gave the nun was supposed to symbolize some bastardized ""fruit from the tree,"" and the Dr. is supposed to symbolize the snake from the bible.  I thought it was a stretch at first, until i took into account how he had to persuade her to take a bite against the sister's wishes.  Anyhow, the Mossy Banks quote comes into play because the dude is just insane about plants.  What's in the woods is a plant/human hybrid, or maybe just the tree itself.  It would make sense that if they pay homage to possession/demon movies that they would have SOME evil dead in there.  What if the reason he is trying to keep her away is because he doesn't want her attacked, a la chick from The Evil Dead, but fed her fruit from the tree to ""open her eyes,"" or start her on the process of some type of ""awakening"" and whatnot?  Just in time for the apple, the possessed kid shows up and wreaks havok, possesses the sister because she took a bite, and that's when the shit starts hitting the fan.

This may also tie the aliens from the first episode in as well.  They are doing experiments on Kit of some sort, so what if they are doing the same thing to a degree, making hybrid humans, which is why the doctor is so keen on getting inside his head and experimenting on him?

I dunno, I would like to think I am onto something here, but it seems like a long shot.  I'm now 100% more interested in the show than I was last night.  I do know the plants mean something, because the Dr. guy is just obsessed with them and whatever is in the forest, and fruit. Those are clues, and this is the only way I can work it out.

Holy hell, you guys!  That episode was insane.  Anyway, there seems to be a lot of confusion around here for a few ghost rules, so I thought we could put what we know in one place.  Please feel free to add to this list so we can help clarify for some newbies or whoever.


* People who died in the murder house stay there.  It doesn't matter if your bones are there, it only matters that you actually died there.


* You can't leave the house if you died there.  Violet magically disappeared from the car when Ben drove off because she is dead and stuck there.  If you see people outside the house (including at Constance's house) they're not dead.

 
* There is one exception to the above rule.  The ghosts can leave on Halloween!  Apparently other ghosts can roam the earth on Halloween too, as we saw with Tate's victims.  If you saw a ghost outside the house (like Hayden in the security guard car, Tate on the beach, or Moira with her dying mom), this doesn't mean ghosts can leave the house all the time.  It was just the Halloween episode.


* There's no confirmation about why some ghosts show their murder injuries and some don't, but there are theories.  Some people think that people who show their wounds don't know they're dead, but this doesn't seem to be consistent so far.  It might just be for dramatic effect.


* The monster in the basement is Thaddeus, who was Nora and Charles's baby.  He was kidnapped and murdered and chopped up, but he was brought back to the house and then brought back to life.  Nora tried to kill him, but he had a taste for blood and now he slices up people who come into the basement with his teeth and claws.


* The sweet disfigured guy in the attic with the red ball is Beauregard (Beau), Constance's son.  Tate is Constance's other son, and Addie was her daughter before she got hit by a car off the property.  Addie isn't a ghost because Constance didn't get her to the property line on time.


* Constance isn't dead.  She's been off the property numerous times and is therefore not a murder house ghost.


* It's unclear why we can see Moira as both young and old, even though she died young.  Moira says it's because women see things for what they really are, while men see the object they want.  When Ben started to be less of a d-bag, he suddenly realized that Moira wasn't young and hot after all.

* Tate is rubberman.  He put the suit on to rape Vivian in order to give Nora a baby.  Nora was protective and motherly to him as a child and he wants to give her what she wants.


Anyone have anything else to add?  I'm sure there are some more general rules and things we've learned that people seem to be confused about.  Thanks, dudes!  Can't wait for the finale. :)"	t5_2spug	True

1359446846.0	17hj9q	For those who wanted to read my analysis of Season 1.	alucidexit	27	13	11	"""You're gonna regret it!""

I have to admit, I was damn disappointed by the American Horror Story finale, and for a lot of reasons. I've loved every single episode up until the finale. 'Birth' was the perfect penultimate episode. Vivien and Violet are both dead, and Ben Harmon is left alone in the house to deal with the prospect of having to raise the demon kid on his own. Manipulative Constance has stolen the demon kid, and desires to raise him herself while a devious Hayden plans to steal the child.

Previews contained various hints that there was some universal truth that was still unbeknownst to the audience. Mainly, I thought this was going to pertain to either A) Constance's 4th child or B) How to get rid of the ghosts (which was brought up several times throughout this season).

Within the first thirty minutes, we get the most disappointing cop out of the entire series: Ben Harmons death. Ben Harmon has arguably been the main character of the series, with the family's entire situation revolving around his mistakes and his attempts to repent. This entire season was about infidelity, and mistakes coming back to haunt you, and while we got this via a very anticlimactic murder scene with Hayden, BEN ENDS UP HAPPY. What message does this leave us with? It left me with: Death solves everything since after Vivien died, bygones were just bygones, and they went back to being a happy family. 

This episode should have peaked with Ben Harmon's fate. Ben Harmon's fate should have been the climax of this episode, but instead, they decided to have Hayden form some odd alliance with the people that attacked Vivien and Violet in the 2nd episode off screen (seriously, this scene would have made a lot more sense had we previously seen these guys conspiring together). They attack Ben and hang him from the ceiling. I could deal with this, though. It may have been disappointing, but it wasn't a deal breaker... perhaps the episode has more in store for us...

Constance somehow regains the child from Hayden when Travis slits Hayden's throat (even though she's already dead). Not sure how this makes much sense other than a cruddy plot point to have Constance get the kid back from Hayden. I was expecting a bit more of a power struggle here. This baby has been the bargaining point for almost every ghost, and yet Hayden just hands her over. I wasn't so much upset with what happened so much as the execution. The cinematography was awful, and the editing paced the scene so fast, it was difficult to grasp exactly what just happened. 

Almost instantly a new family moves in and we are treated to deja vu as the new family goes through similar motions as the Harmon's. When the new husband started sleep walking to the kitchen, I thought we might get some explanation... Loraine comments that she wants the people of the house to feel what she felt, but I'm not sure if that explains the sleep walking, because Larry sleep walked, and that was before Loraine killed herself, so that doesn't really make much sense to me.

One of the reasons why this episode was so polarizing is because it was such a shift in tone from the rest of the season. I, personally, got a very Shakespearian tragedy feel. Ben is a protagonist who continually makes similar mistakes with good intentions, but never learns. He's blinded by his grounding in ""reality"" to see truth. The series was moving in a tragic direction. Instead, we got Beetlejuice. 

Yes, the family died, but it's not a sacrifice if they all end up together and everything is peaches and gravy. When everyone dies at the end of a horror movie, they don't do a sequence where they're all together in the afterlife, because it's meant to end on a tragic note, and this is why I was against Ben Harmon dying in the first place. It's much more torturous if he doesn't get to be with his family.

Did anyone else think this show was going to move into a plotline about freeing the ghosts? This was somewhat touched upon with Moira and the medium. Moira mentions in one of the earlier episodes that she wishes for her body to be dug up so her spirit can be free, allowing her to be with her mother. Later on, the medium mentions about spells that could be used to free spirits or send them away. Violet attempts the spell, but it doesn't work. I was really hoping the show would have touched upon this. Mainly, because I really want to see Moira's tired soul get some rest, but also because I feel it would have made for a much more compelling finale, involving all the ghosts in a much more direct way.

Imagine, you'd have Violet, Vivien, Ben, Moira, Chad, and Patrick on one side (I put Chad and Patrick on here, because at this point in the series, it seems they do not wish to spend eternity with one another), and all the other ghosts + Constance on the other side. This is just off the top of my head, so it's not perfect, but in my head this would have made for a much better ending:

Everything at the beginning of the episode is the same right before Ben's death. Hayden comes to kill Ben, but is foiled by Tate, who saves Ben to try to repent for what he's done. Ben takes the child, and runs down the stairs of the house. Moira is waiting outside. Moira informs Ben that if he wants to save his family, he needs to make the ultimate sacrifice: He has to return to the house, unearth the bodies, and burn the house to the ground, freeing all the spirits including his wife and daughter. 

At first, he's reluctant, wishing to have a place where he can visit them whenever he wants. Vivien and Violet appear and convince Ben to go through with it. Constance catches wind of this and attempts to kill Ben. Ben knocks her unconscious. Moira informs Ben of where certain bodies are buried. He digs up the bodies she tells him to. Ben then sets the house on fire. This would have been an incredibly emotional scene involving all the characters:

Chad and Patrick hug, achieving a sense of closure with one another, realizing that while they loved each other, they weren't soul mates. 

Moira's mother appears behind her, saying that she's ready to be taken up. Moira walks away with her mother. 

Nora comes to her revelation that she's not fit for motherhood, and hands the still born baby to Vivien as her and Charles ascend. 

Vivien would finally forgive Ben for everything, and she would tell him to take their child away and raise him properly. Violet would forgive Ben as well. Ben would inform Violet that it was Tate who saved him. Tate and Violet would have a moment, where Violet would again say that she loves Tate but that she can't forgive him, and Tate would come to some understanding that he will now suffer in the afterlife for his crimes, and that he hopes when he's done suffering, that they can be together. The three of them disappear, and Ben is left crying in front of the burning house.

Constance appears from behind, and stabs Ben several times in the back, screaming. Ben dies. Constance drags Ben's body into the burning house, leaving him to burn. She could make it look like a suicide or arson to cover her name. 

In the process, Constance's face is burned, and left scarred. She exits, and takes the baby for her own. As she walks away from the fire, scarred, she carries the baby in one arm, and smiles before it cuts to black.

I think that would have made for a much better ending, and would have been more fitting with this season's theme that your mistakes will come back to haunt you.

I think that the events at the asylum have been part of a shared hallucination, possibly instigated by Arden and caused chemically.  The storyline is around the same time-line that the MK-ULTRA project was being performed, and mental patients were used as test cases.

I think that all of the unnatural happenings have been shared hallucinations: the mutants in the woods, the alien implant, the possession, Sister Jude's newspaper &amp; broken glasses, and even Bloodyface in the present day.  I think that whatever's being used is putting people into a very suggestive state, bringing out their fears and making them do some particularly horrible things to one another.

I think Arden is behind these experiments, not only because of his reviewing a book on mind-control in the last episode, but also because he appears to be instigating a few of the different incidents (such as removing the alien probe from Kit and sending Sister Mary Eunice into the woods to feed the mutants).  I'm also starting to believe that he's only suggested to Shelly that he removed her legs, and that she fully believes it because of whatever has been introduced into the asylum.

I think that Arden may also have started becoming influenced by whatever he's testing on the others, since he was experimenting alone on the alien probe, and may also start to become suggestible himself.

1322804678.0	mx7du	Some thoughts on Tate and Constance.	arbitrarycolors	16	3	12	"None of this is conclusive, but these are just some connections I am starting to see with possible allusions to future revelations. In the first episode, we vivien restore a mural within the house. (If I remember correctly, I believe Constance stops by while Vivien is doing so and makes a snide remark about it). While she is revealing the mural, we see [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/uBQ9z.jpg). Then in the basement scene at the end of the pilot, Tate seems to call on some monster, as kind of seen [here](http://imgur.com/uxOvl) (if you watch it you can see the face, I was having trouble timing it right on hulu).Then in Spooky little girl, we see Constance painting something similar in both style and content to the murals in the house. 

I think Constance had painted the murals. I also think the monster Tate calls on in the basement is the monster depicted in the mural. This would mean that whatever connection Tate has to this monster, Constance is fully aware of it. I think the mural depicts the monster whispering in the ear of the bearded man (classic artistic allusion of a Muse speaking inspiration to the artist). So with the implication that Constance is probably painting a response to an event in Tate's life (just as she is painting a response to the death of Addy), I think this reflects that some dark creature guided Tate during his life (and possibly guided others before Tate as well), and now as a ghost Tate can call upon it.

Though everyone is focusing on the music being played (I put a spell on you) or that Pagan rituals were discussed, I was wondering about something a little more obvious.

When Sister Jude went into her dream sequence, she began singing ""The Name Game."" Yes, it's the name of the episode, and yes she was listing off inmate's names in a later scene. But I'm curious about why they chose this song specifically. 

What if part of the overarching story for next season is that the main character is suffering from Amnesia. It's a good story device to have the character discovering things along with the viewer/reader. We can begin to unravel various plot points that the writers wish to throw at us and little-by-little understand the main character's life.

Hell, you could even make the end-of-season twist be that the character was actually evil or something similar.

Wouldn't her first child have been Addie?  We know that Tate was born in 1977, because he has mentioned that his dad left him when he was 6, which would have been 1983 when Constance killed him.  

But in the opening sequence of episode 1, it's 1978 (when Tate would have been 1), and Addie is shown to be at least 6 or 7....So that makes Addie older than Tate

So, Is Constance saying she should have stopped after Addie since (even though she had Tate), she had 2 more children with ""maladies"".  Or did the writers screw up, implying that Tate was her first, and she should have stopped after him because he was the ""perfect"" one?"	t5_2spug	True

Season 1 was better to me.

Edit: i give season 1 a B+ at worst and season 2 a C at best.

Edit #2: wow, i must be really missing something... i just don't see how season 2 was any good really.  for reference, my favorite shows are Mad Men, Breaking Bad, and The Wire so maybe i'm just digging too deep wanting a show of that magnitude... but then again, season 1 is certainly not on par with those shows yet i found it great.  oh well, glad others enjoyed this season a lot!"	t5_2spug	True

Some of the ghosts seem to have retained their 'death wounds' so to speak, but yet Moira appears to men as herself if she'd never been shot, and to others as herself if she'd survived. The others that don't show wounds are Tate, (he's not riddled with chest wounds when he's topless with Violet post coitus) Hayden (face not all bloodied and bruised up from shovel) and the twins.

Nora has her exit wound, the nurses appear all stabbied, Beau doesn't have injuries to speak of, and all the teenagers Tate gunned down had their original wounds.

Chad and Pat are uncertain, as they were both shot in the chest region and could easily cover this with clothes.

My theory is, I guess, once the ghost has ""come to terms"" or ""accepted"" the fact that yes, they are dead, they are able to see themselves and manifest without their wounds. Usually, once a ghost comes to terms with their deadness they pass on or whatever, but the house keeps them there. The teenagers that Tate shot obviously haven't had any kindof closure so they appear how they died. 

This would obviously have to go hand in hand with the theory that yes, Tate knows he's dead. 

Another small thing I'm confused about, Constance and the medium told Violet about Tate saying once he accepted what happened he could move on, but how could this be true as they both know the house traps spirits there?"	t5_2spug	True

The second season fell flat for me when it tried to throw all possible horror genres against the wall to see what stuck, but it had its moments as well.

With season 3 coming up I thought I'd attempt to spark debate with the idea of Female Empowerment as a central theme of the show (indeed a theme that seems to run through all of Murphy's shows). The show has repeatedly used the idea of feminism and male dominance as a theme to show struggle.

With the announcement that season 3 will be about 'female empowerment' one has to wonder just what the creators themselves thought the first 2 seasons were about. Will we get exhausted with it? Will it be even more blatant and obvious this year? Will it be spun slightly differently? Do you like what Murphy does with all this? Do you hate it?

We're contemplating shooting it in a place in the country where true horror has been. We've got lots of delicious plans.""  If the Salem Witch Trials aren't true horror then I don't know what to say.

But others have no signs of how they died whatsoever. TAte is seen without a shirt on and he has no bullet holes in his body, elizabeth isn't walking around cut in half, and the first owner of the house doesn't have a visible bullet hole. maybe there is not a explanation but i'm just curious.
Thanks!!
edit: i finished the first season and i guess the dead can choose to show how they died or whatever because elizabeth is seen on the table all cut up for miguel to see. whereas earlier she looked normal.

**Sister Eunice isn't possessed by a demon, she just *believes* she is.**

Obviously, a reoccurring theme this season is the question of sanity. I started thinking it would be interesting to look at demonic possession as a mental illness, or a psychotic break, instead of anything supernatural. 

The original possessed boy was a red herring. The demon who possessed him, with the power to lift the bed and throw the priest across the room, will never be explained. It's purpose was purely to convince the audience Eunice's possession is legitimate. 

Besides having all the gossip, we haven't seen her perform any feats like the demon in episode 2. I think the great reveal will be that the twisted murderer she has become was really her own doing all along."	t5_2spug	True

1324284475.0	nibk5	Hypothetically, let's assume there is a new story per season...	mrWLSN	14	5	15	"From early on in the season, around the time the show was officially renewed, there was a report that the show's writing staff had plans to end our current story at the end of this season. The report also stated that there was the idea of a following season taking a new start in a different location with different characters.

Since then, as this season has started to reach its climax, the discussions of ""where will the show go from here"" have become more and more abundant. There is a mix of feelings as to whether the show can continue with our current family, a new family in the same house, or backstories of the house itself - or if the show may lose its formula by continuing down this line.

I have the personal opinion that a new start could keep the show fresh and keep the nice slow reveal formula intact. So here I am, making this thread for discussions of possible scenarios for if this were hypothetically to happen.

Here are my ideas:

* Inmates in a haunted prison - It doesn't necessarily have to be a family, does it? The medium in the latest episode of the current season said that prisons and hospitals are big places for hauntings due to the amount of concentrated sorrow, regret and evil. There's the options for a number of twists and turns as to the source, which inmates are ghosts and which ones are alive, corruption with guards and wardens, etc. The fact that Larry has been transferred to a prison could be a season tie-in.

* Hospital - Same as the above, pretty much. A greater mix of genders possibly with nurses and doctors. There's late shifts to have the alone in the dark moments and plenty of deaths to keep you guessing. Plus we've seen what doctors are capable of in Charles Montgomery. The fact that this could be anywhere, and even concurrent with season 1 could have some crossover characters, even.

* Possession - Could be anywhere, in a new house with a new family. It's a classic horror story, really, and the show seems to follow classic horror stories. Exorcisms are pretty big in the horror category too.

I'm sure there are plenty of other ideas. These are just the ones I had sitting in my head, trying to keep in mind the best way to tie possible scenarios to the formula and style we have seen in AHS so far.

1322370824.0	mqkyu	I was talking to one of my coworkers and she had a theory about the security guard...	melanzana	14	4	9	She thinks he's dead too. I never really thought about that before. He always gets there really quickly when Vivian pushes the panic button and the only time we've seen him off the property is when Hayden was arrested. And that was on Halloween when all of the spirits could walk free. Except for it was pretty much morning and I'm assuming that's how Hayden disappeared, since she had to be back at the house by then. I'm really not sold on this but I was wondering what others thought. I do feel like the security guard is going to become a more important character though.	t5_2spug	True
1322191080.0	moi6a	My theory on this whole thing	Iamkitty	15	3	38	"Okay so everyone correct me if I'm missing anything.

* Tate: he doesn't yet know he's dead or that he shot up the school. I think he was possessed when he did it by some spirit of the house, the one who is primarily controlling everything and I think Constance made it happen because she wanted to keep Tate forever and realized that when she killed the maid and her husband they stayed in the house. I also think Tate does not know he had sex with Vivian. He told Violet he couldn't get it up when they were on the beach and I believe he implied he is a virgin.

* Violet: she's dead. She died when when she took the pills and she is now a ghost like Tate. I got this from the fact that she started seeing the other spirits after and Tate told her that she can see them now because she is ""evolved"" like Tate. Also she hasn't been to school in two weeks because she cannot leave the house. 

* Nora's husband: is the spirit that is possessing Tate. He wants to give her a baby and he did something to the house that won't let spirits die when he brought their baby back to life. Nora told him she tried to kill the baby and couldn't...it was already dead like Tate is. Also he killed the gay couple because they couldn't have his baby for Nora. Also Nora and Tate get along so well when he is possessed (like when he killed the gay people) because he is her husband and she knows that on some level.

1359752389.0	17ps1m	My best guess on season 3's plot	justinsmama	12	2	6	"My best guess for Season 3 of AHS is the following:  we follow the life and career of a famous, Hollywood debutant type through modern day stardom and all that goes with it—a stalker perhaps or death threats… or a killing. Maybe Jessica Lange plays a manager or parent of the falling star (they said she’d be a “glamour cat”). Think Selena (not Gomez) and her untimely demise in 1995 or the recent inmate’s plot to have Justin Bieber castrated and murdered. Maybe Sarah Paulson is an investigator and Evan Peters is the druggie low life boyfriend of the star. Think Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston.  

The writers have also indicated S3 would take place in the south. 

Like the writers did in season 2, maybe they’ll pull from the headlines what people concern themselves with. In the 60’s, it was aliens, serial killers and exorcisms.  Nowadays, it’s a whole bunch of things (terrorism, gun violence, etc.) but based on some Easter eggs in season 2, this is my best guess. 

I’ve enjoyed reading some other theories about a voo-doo or witchcraft theme or carnival setting with clowns. Did the popular thought of the location being in New Orleans come about from only the songs that played? Love Potion No. 9 and I Put a Spell on You? If so, I could argue those songs imply a love story or like I said before, a stalker.

A lot of references were given to New York City, but specifically the theater scene. Lana lives in New York, and her wife is an opera singer who mentions performing at the Metropolitan Opera. Later in the episode, Lana mentions meeting the reporter at the Kennedy Center (which I think is D.C.; correct me if I'm wrong).

The whole theater thing strongly correlates with a [theory](http://www.reddit.com/r/AmericanHorrorStory/comments/16acti/an_interesting_connection_between_the_songs_on/) I posted about a few weeks ago.

Theater has a history of urban legend and superstition, and could definitely serve as a basis for the horror aspect of the show (see [The Scottish Play](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scottish_play) and other [superstitions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatrical_superstitions)).

So, here's some ideas I've come up lately:


-The new baby is the antichrist.

-This makes Tate the devil incarnate.

-Tate was once a normal kid. Then, one day, he was possessed by the devil. This possession acted itself out through Tate's ""schizophrenia""/shooting up the school. This also explains why he can't seem to remember why he did it/that he did it at all. 

-Tate has been manipulating Violet the entire time.

-The house is divided between those who want to bring on the ""end times"" with the baby, those who want the opposite and those who don't know that the baby is the antichrist.

-The ""stillborn"" baby is actually still alive and being cared for by the ghosts who don't want the evil baby to bring on the apocalypse.

-The two babies will grow up and eventually have an epic battle of good and evil.

-Season 2 will continue with a new family in the house and everyone trying to convince/manipulate them into either helping bring on the apocalypse or helping to stop it.


That's all for now. DISCUSS! 

---

EDIT:

-Or maaaybe the other ghosts have no idea about the bigger, apocalyptic picture at all... maybe the doctor just hid the fact that the first baby was actually alive so he could give it to his wife. That way she'd finally have the child she always wanted.

But in one episode Tate mentions that his dad left the family when he was ""around 10."" 

Which brings me to question whether Hugo was not Tate's father or even married to Constance? She said she loved him since she was 16 and when she catches him with Moira it does play out like her catching him cheating. 

Or is Tate just getting his own timeline wrong and ""around 10"" is really 5/6 years old to him? Sounds fishy. Plus he said left and not that his dad died. So where is Tate's dad?

Danvers State Hospital
Built in 1878 to house 500, Danvers State Hospital (formally known the State Lunatic Hospital at Danvers) had over 2,300 patients at its peak in the 1940s. Needless to say, conditions were hellish. Danvers is the rumored birthplace of the lobotomy, and doctors used that barbaric procedure, as well as electroshock therapy, to the keep the inmates in line. 

The facility closed in 1992, but a plan to turn the building into condos stalled when it promptly burned down. **The structure's cursed history shouldn't be that much of a surprise: It was built on plot of land once owned by John Hathorne, the most unforgiving of the Salem Witch Trial judges.**

However, Bloodyface jr only names his father at the beginning of Coat Hanger, and it's so obvious I want to believe it is a red herring.

Most obvious curveball: Sister Eunice

The demon's tapped into Eunice's sexuality in previous episodes, but hasn't really indulged it. She released Thredson, so they have a relationship. As well, Bloodyface jr could also be the modern host of the Demon.

Another possible curveball: Grace

Since she just showed up pregnant, the child will obviously play into the resolution of the story. What if Bloodyface jr is an alien baby, and only mistakenly believes Thredson to be his father?

Anyway, your thoughts?"	t5_2spug	True

I'm now starting to think that the show is going to reference ancient astronaut theory in order to tie up the whole religion/aliens theme this season.  I have a feeling that on the show, all the angels, demons, and god figure will all be aliens.  According to [this article](http://crash.ihug.co.nz/~marshall/aliengod.htm), many biblical miracles can be explained through alien technology/intervention.  Its really cheesy, but it could work with this season.  Aliens show up whenever Kit has sex due to Catholic guilt and perceiving sex as dirty.  

Anyway, I'm bad at articulating my thoughts.  I just think there may be a connection to the whole god and aliens thing."	t5_2spug	True

This theory would explain:

-Threadson's abandonment

-How a modern Bloody Face exists, possibly from an embryo harvested from Lana.

1323950106.0	ndov5	Does this theory make sense?	FungiPenguin	10	2	9	"Ok, so I've been mulling something over recently. Since the episode where the psychic/medium explains the potential evil incarnate of when a ghost impregnates the living and also gives the anecdote about the pope and the end of days, I assumed Vivian's child from Tate is going to be the antichrist. In the book of Daniel (I think) the coming of the antichrist is precluded by four beasts. Could these four beasts be Constance's children? She does have rather poor luck with children (Beau-disfigured, Addie-trisomy 21 I guess, and Tate-mass murder/rapist). And the new baby would be blood related.

Two snags. I wouldn't consider Addie or Beau as beasts because they seemed good hearted. Also that would make the newborn the fourth beast, not the antichrist. BUT I wouldn't be surprised if something crazy like Ben ending up being Constance's offspring or she had a stillborn or something. Also, maybe she is a beast along with her three children making her grandson the antichrist.

1323774916.0	navu4	Some subtle (and some overt) references I've noticed. What have you noticed? [May contain spoilers if you're behind]	DMF171	12	4	12	"Ok, so the one reference that I think a lot of people noticed is the scene in the first episode in which Tate fantasizes about shooting up the school is strikingly similar to the beginning of [this scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E84OWq6z3IQ&amp;feature=related) from Kill Bill Vol. 1. Tate later name drops Tarantino when he and Violet are on the beach in the Halloween episode.

At the start of episode 2, when the young girl is bound and stabbed, the high pitch violins that play when she is repeatedly stabbed in the back are similar too, if not the exact same, from the famous [shower scene in Psycho](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VP5jEAP3K4).

I noticed numerous references and connections to Kurt Cobain. When Violet and Tate first meet and are sitting in her room together, they talk music and he asks if ""she has any Cobain?"". That's when I noticed that Tate bares a striking resemblance to the Nirvana frontman. To go even further with that, In episode 2 when Tate is in a therapy session with Dr. Harmon, he is wearing clothes that look uncannily similar to some that [Cobain has been photographed in.](http://www.ehx.com/assets/blog/ehx-tone-tips-3-kurt.jpg) Lastly, after Tate carries out his massacre of the school he is gunned down in his room by a SWAT team in a scenario commonly referred to as ""suicide by cop."" This scene is depicted as taking place in 1994 which is also the year that Kurt Cobain committed suicide.

Also, and this one might be a stretch, I find the opening credits for the show with its gritty and unnerving clips of the murder house and how it's paired with industrial music to be similar to the [opening title scene for Se7en.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k2gsEI34CE)

I've really enjoyed finding these references and I wanted to share them with you guys and also hear any you may have noticed.

1323421163.0	n62i4	Do the ghosts need to see their dead body in order to be able to leave the house? And other ghost questions from a Noob	BrandoMcGregor	12	3	10	"Tate prevented Violet from going to school because he didn't want her to find out that she couldn't leave the house. 


However now that Violet has seen her body, will she be able to leave?


If seeing your body is a prerequisite for ghosts to be able to leave the house, then how is it that Hailey was able to be arrested and taken into the cop car?


Why is it that some ghosts don't know that they're dead? While others seem to know instantly?  Does it have anything to do with how they died? 


Why did Moira continue to age while the others have not?  Why has she aged so rapidly also? If she was in her early 20's in the early 80's why does she look like she's in her late 60's? 


Constance summoned the ""burn man"" in the attic when she needed to talk to him. This made me think he was a ghost. But apparently he has his own apartment and can be thrown in jail.  So is he a ghost?

1323342583.0	n4pwz	About the wounds.. [has spoilers if you haven't watched the Smoldering Children]	Erinjb	11	2	16	"I know it is a popular theory in the subreddit (and pretty much anywhere people are talking about the show), but I disagree about the ghosts not showing wounds until after they realize their deaths. 

An inordinate amount of people apparently die from torso wounds or essentially asphyxiation in that house. Those two deaths wouldn't show the wounds when everyone is clothed, which they usually are. 

List of characters who have died from chest wounds/asphixiation:

* Chad (Shot in the heart)
* Patrick (Shot all over the torso after taking a major beating)
* Beau (Suffocated)
* Tate (Shot in the torso)
* Violet (Pill overdose)
* Hugo (Shot in the torso)
* Travis (Stabbed in the torso)
* Bianca (Murder House crazy patient, ax to the stomach)
* Elizabeth Short (asphyxiation from nitrous oxide, or other anesthetic gas)

Those who have died by a visible (usually head) wound:

* Moira (Shot in the eye)
* Hayden (Beaten with a shovel)
* Gladys (who asphyxiation by drowning and still awkwardly shows up soaking wet.)
* Maria (stabbed in the torso, but still wearing bloody nurse uniform)
* Fiona and Dallas (throats slit)
* Nora Montgomery (shot herself through the head)
* Charles Montgomery (shot in the head)
* Bryan and Troy (Clawed to shit by Thaddeus[?])
* Tate's victims from the school shooting
* Thaddeus the basement monster (?)
* Larry's wife and daughters (Burned)

People who are clearly cognizant of their status:

* Chad
* Patrick
* Moira
* Maria and Gladys
* Hayden
* Travis
* Larry's family
* Tate's victims

People recently made aware of their status:

* Tate (maybe)
* Violet
* Elizabeth Short

People who don't realize they are dead:

* Nora Montgomery
* Beau
* Bryan and Troy


I really don't think the ghosts awareness of their status has anything to do with the visibility of wounds. Feel free to argue."	t5_2spug	True
