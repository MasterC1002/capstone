As you are probably aware, posting personal information is not allowed, and you can in fact be banned for it. In a recent post, some users managed to find out where the original poster lived. While they did not include the address, this is still not allowed. It is still very possible to find the address with the photos that they posted. 

Strictly speaking, this *is* personal information. We won't be banning these users, as I'm sure they wouldn't have done it if they had known they could be banned. But this is a warning: personal information is taken very seriously on reddit, and someone's home is not an exception. We will be banning any users who do so in the future.

Thanks, and please upvote for visibility (I make no karma from this).

[http://i.imgur.com/YVl6p.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/YVl6p.jpg)

After viewing almost every setup I decided something needed to be done.  So I visited /r/buildapc, got some help and built my first PC (very easy):

[http://i.imgur.com/USmc7.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/USmc7.jpg)

I also picked up three monitors, speakers and a DAC, well my desk could no longer contain the awesomeness. So I found a guy selling two Ikea Jerkers for $50. So I bought both of them and sold the other to a friend for $40. 

So now, thanks to all you people and your awesome inspiring setups here is my current setup:

I really hate(love) you guys.
